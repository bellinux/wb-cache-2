5|$|In 1999, New Age author V. M. Rabolu {{wrote in}} Hercolubus or Red Planet that Barnard's star is {{actually}} a planet known to the ancients as Hercolubus, which purportedly came <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to Earth in the past, destroying Atlantis, and will come close to Earth again. Lieder subsequently used Rabolu's ideas to bolster her claims.|$|E
5|$|Seattle {{replaced}} Lamar Neagle with Pappa in the 74th {{minute in}} an attempt to create an advantage. Philadelphia answered with two more chances that almost won the match. Casey received a yellow card at the 57th minute and was later replaced by Pedro Ribeiro. In the 88th minute, Raymon Gaddis won the ball and took a shot that was deflected. Ribeiro took a shot but it lacked power. In stoppage time, Vincent Nogueira had another close shot that struck the post and ricocheted <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to the goal before being cleared.|$|E
5|$|In early March, Camacho {{resigned}} {{after three}} consecutive league draws, citing {{his inability to}} motivate the club. His assistant Fernando Chalana then took over, but Benfica continued to disappoint; they were eliminated in the UEFA Cup and mired in second place in mid-March. In April, the situation deteriorated further; Benfica matched their worst league defeat in 60 years, slipped to fourth place and was knocked out of the Portuguese Cup by Sporting CP. An away draw in May's opening game left the club <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to finishing fourth. One week later, fans had the bitter-sweet experience of celebrating Rui Costa's final match and seeing Benfica finish fourth, their worst finish since 2001–02.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Botany Bay, Captain John Hunter of HMS Sirius {{made contact}} with the French ships, and he and the commander, Captain de Clonard, {{exchanged}} greetings. Clonard advised Hunter that the fleet commander was Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse. Sirius successfully cleared Botany Bay, but the other ships were in great difficulty. Charlotte was blown <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to rocks; Friendship and Prince of Wales became entangled, both ships losing booms or sails; Charlotte and the Friendship actually collided; and Lady Penrhyn nearly ran aground. Despite these difficulties, all the remaining ships finally managed to clear Botany Bay and sail to Sydney Cove on 26 January. The last ship anchored there at about 3pm.|$|E
5|$|Al-Muktafi {{also kept}} up the {{perennial}} conflict with the Byzantine Empire, with varying success. In May 902, al-Qasim ibn Sima al-Farghani was appointed {{in command of the}} frontier districts of the Jazira. In 902 or 903, a naval raid reached the island of Lemnos, <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to the Byzantine capital, Constantinople; the island was plundered and its inhabitants carried off into slavery. Nevertheless, in May 903, the newly appointed governor of Tarsus, Abu'l-Asha'ir Ahmad ibn Nasr, was dispatched to the frontier districts with gifts for the Byzantine ruler, Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), and in return, Byzantine envoys arrived in Baghdad for negotiations on a prisoner exchange. The exchange eventually took place in September–October 905, at the river Lamus in Cilicia, but was interrupted because the Byzantines reneged on the agreed terms. After further negotiations, the exchange was completed in August 908.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
5|$|German close {{air support}} also began to take its toll, forcing units such as the Soviet 38th Army onto the defensive. It ranged over the front, {{operating}} <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to the changing frontline. Air interdiction and direct ground support damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder remarked the air attacks {{went a long way}} to breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could do very little to stop these air attacks. Not only did the Luftwaffe attack the enemy, it also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved them. Over the course of the 16-day battle the German 6th Air Corps {{played a major role in}} the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tons of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tons of material to the front.|$|E
5|$|In 661, Wulfhere is {{recorded}} in the Chronicle as harrying Ashdown, in West Saxon territory. The Gewisse, {{thought to be the}} original group from which the West Saxons came, appear to have originally settled in the upper Thames valley, and what records survive of the 6th century show them active in that region. The Mercian resurgence under Wulfhere placed them under severe pressure. Also in the early 660s, the West Saxon see of Dorchester, in the same area, was divided, and a new bishopric set up at Winchester. This decision was probably a reaction to the advance of the Mercians into the traditional heartland of the West Saxons, leaving Dorchester <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to the border. Within a few years, the Dorchester see was abandoned; the exact date is not known, but it was probably in the mid 660s.|$|E
5|$|The {{diversion}} {{of the boats}} to Pompée prevented Saumarez from launching a planned amphibious assault against Isla Verda with the squadron's Marines, and in the fitful breeze, both Caesar and Audacious were beginning to drift <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to the shoals around the island: if they grounded, then they would share Hannibals fate {{directly in front of}} the island's batteries. Observing the failure of his planned attack on the French squadron, Saumarez raised the signal at 13:35 for his ships to withdraw to Gibraltar. Pompée was already well on the way thanks to the towing boats, and Caesar and Audacious were able to cut their remaining anchors and limp out of the bay with the assistance of a sudden land breeze that carried them rapidly out of reach of the French and Spanish guns. They were joined by Venerable and Spencer as they left, the battered squadron retiring to Gibraltar leaving the almost dismasted hulk of Hannibal grounded in Algeciras harbour.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April 1939 he {{narrowly}} {{escaped with}} his life alongside Geoffrey de Havilland; both men parachuting to safety. They had taken a Moth Minor into the air to test its response to spins. The prototypes had an anti-spin parachute but preceding tests had been carried out without the need to resort to the safety measure. Geoffrey put the aircraft into a left-hand spin which was recovered. Climbing back to 8,000 feet the aircraft was put into it a right-hand spin. The engine cut out, the nose reared-up and the aircraft stalled and entered a flat spin. Geoffrey asked John through the Gosport tube to try to escape their perilous situation after the controls proved non-responsive to de Havilland's efforts. Both decided to parachute out. Upon doing so the Moth declined its nose and recovered from the spin. The engine ignition had been left on and the wind-milling propeller started the engine. The aircraft began circling the descending airmen at <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> range. Fortunately it descended {{at a faster rate}} and was destroyed when it hit the ground. Cunningham casually took pictures of the wreckage and his parachute which exemplified his cool nature.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee (Danny McBride) is {{the pilot}} of the Covenant and Maggie Faris' husband. During a space walk to repair the solar {{recharge}} sails of the Covenant, Tennessee inadvertently intercepts a signal from Shaw, which prompts the colonization mission to divert towards the signal's source. While {{the brunt of the}} crew embarks on an excursion {{to the surface of the}} Engineer home world, Tennessee pilots Covenant in high orbit. Due to an ionic storm, he is unable to have adequate communication with the expedition. To regain communications, Tennessee brings Covenant <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to the storm, which allows Daniels to privately reveal to him that Maggie is dead. Tennessee pilots a cargo lander down to the surface of the planet and extracts Daniels, Lope and David impersonating Walter, assisting with killing an Alien in the process. Aboard Covenant, the crew is alerted to an Alien stowaway, prompting Tennessee to work with Daniels to dispose of it. They lure it to the terraforming bay, where it is ejected into space. Tennessee subsequently returns to cryosleep before Daniels does.|$|E
5|$|The 2002–03 {{season began}} with the same {{optimism}} that the Raptors exhibited in three consecutive playoff seasons, although it faded early. Carter, while voted as a starter in the 2003 All-Star Game, suffered a knee injury, while Davis expressed disinterest in Toronto, and Wilkens' laissez-faire attitude created a team that lacked the motivation and spirit of the previous years' teams. The team was ravaged with injuries, losing an NBA record number of player games due to injury. Furthermore, the Raptors recorded the dubious honour of being the only team in NBA history not to dress 12 players for a single game in a season. Wilkens was criticized heavily by the Toronto media for his inability {{to clamp down on}} his players when necessary, especially given this was the year that Wilkens overtook Bill Fitch for the most losses by an NBA coach, with his loss total getting <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to his win total. The Raptors ended the season with a 24–58 record and Wilkens was fired. This {{turned out to be a}} blessing in disguise, when the Raptors were given the 4th overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft and brought another star to Toronto in Chris Bosh.|$|E
5|$|As the {{championship}} {{moved into the}} second half of the season, Fernando Alonso maintained a thirty-four-point lead over his nearest rival, Mark Webber, with Sebastian Vettel a further ten points behind. Alonso's outlook for the race was dour, qualifying sixth and pinning his hopes on a wet race as Lewis Hamilton continued McLaren's mid-season resurgence, returning to pole position for the first time since the Malaysian Grand Prix. Following an aborted start triggered by Michael Schumacher lining up in the wrong grid position and then shutting his engine off in the confusion, Hamilton and Grosjean lead the field away. After prematurely moving Jenson Button onto a three-stop strategy, McLaren gave Hamilton the order to hold position as the tight confines of the Hungaroring circuit forced the teams to try to make up positions in the pits. This was evidenced by Kimi Räikkönen, who inherited the lead after the first set of stops and produced a series of fast laps that allowed him to rejoin in second, coming <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to team-mate Grosjean under brakes as he emerged from the pit lane. Despite taking two seconds out of Hamilton's lead within five laps of rejoining the race, Räikkönen was powerless to reel Hamilton in any further. Hamilton won the race, the nineteenth of his career, with Räikkönen second and Grosjean in third. Hamilton's victory brought with it twenty-five points that put him back in championship contention, while a late decision by Red Bull to move Mark Webber onto a three-stop strategy saw the Australian slip further behind Fernando Alonso, as the Spaniard extended his championship lead to forty points.|$|E

25|$|Watchmen by Alan Moore {{is set in}} an {{alternative}} history where the USA and USSR edge <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to nuclear war.|$|E
25|$|In 1853 Kosoko mounted two {{attacks on}} Lagos; one on 5 August 1853 {{and another on}} 11 August 1853 which came <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to the Oba's palace but was rebuffed just in time by a burst of fire from the British naval force under Commander Phillips of HMS Polyphemus.|$|E
25|$|India and Pakistan {{conducted}} {{nuclear tests}} in 1998 {{and the two}} countries each hold significant numbers of nuclear warheads. India and Pakistan fought two wars {{over the issue of}} Kashmir in 1947 and 1965. These two neighbours came <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to a third war during the Kargil conflict in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{evacuated}} enterprises {{remained at}} their new sites after the war. They increased industrial production in Siberia {{to a great}} extent, and became constitutive for many cities, like Rubtsovsk. The most Eastern city to receive them was Ulan-Ude, since Chita was considered <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to China and Japan.|$|E
25|$|Robert Graves recounts a {{game between}} {{officers}} and sergeants at Vermelles in France in 1915, when a bird cage {{with a dead}} parrot inside {{was used as the}} wicket. The game was abandoned when German machine gun fire at an aeroplane caused falling bullets to land <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to the pitch.|$|E
25|$|Rutledge {{continued}} as President of South Carolina until 1778. That year, the South Carolina legislature proposed a new constitution. Rutledge vetoed it, stating that it moved the state <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to a direct democracy, which Rutledge believed {{was only a}} step away from total anarchy. When the legislature overrode his veto, Rutledge resigned.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{cases have}} focused {{attention}} {{on the fact that}} the view of the informed observer has sometimes become <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to becoming the court's view. In dealing with this, the court must adopt the public's view of the facts, not its own view. This distinction is not one of semantics, but bears great significance as it signifies the acceptance of public perception in the judicial process.|$|E
25|$|Nader partook {{in these}} efforts from a <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> range, once having the brains and blood {{of one of}} his bodyguards {{splatter}} across his face as a cannonball fired from a Turkish gun decapitated him in a most grotesque manner. The Russians also sent some support in that they dispatched an engineer as well as a few siege guns although these did very little in progressing the battle.|$|E
25|$|According to the article, some {{contemporary}} {{ministers and}} theologians chose {{to focus on}} the life and teachings of Jesus, rather than on God, since Christ was a figure with great appeal among the broader population, but this solution ran <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to ethical humanism. Biblical literalism, on the other hand, might have had an appeal to the fervent believer, but did not speak to most people in a world where the language of the Bible was increasingly unfamiliar.|$|E
25|$|Schmaltz then {{wanted to}} reach Saint-Louis as fast as possible, by the most direct route, but this would take the fleet <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to the shore, where there were many sandbars and reefs. Experienced crews sailed further out. Méduse was the fastest of the convoy and, {{disregarding}} his orders, the captain quickly lost contact with Loire and Argus. Écho kept pace and attempted to guide Méduse, but to no avail. Écho then prudently moved further out to sea.|$|E
25|$|The screen then {{showed a}} flight {{through the air}} above various European countrysides {{featuring}} castles and mountains. Verne was shown in a helicopter, sitting <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to its open door. After flying over Mont Saint-Michel, Neuschwanstein Castle, various scenes of the English countryside, and New York City's skyline (only in Orlando's version), Verne requested to go even higher. They took him to space, {{in order to show}} that another dream of his, space travel, had come true from his book From the Earth to the Moon.|$|E
25|$|The Wedgwood {{had come}} <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> {{to the shore}} and ran the risk of running aground, and also blocked the Haganahs field of fire. Therefore, the Haganah {{initially}} stayed near Majdal while the Wedgwood moved south to chase the corvette. At 12:52, Egyptian combat aircraft appeared on the scene, but did not engage the Israeli vessels. Both the Haganah and the Wedgwood exchanged fire with Egyptian corvette but the Israeli cannons were of low quality and jammed frequently. They registered hits, but did not impair the corvette's ability to move or fire back. The corvette was also unable to do damage.|$|E
25|$|In her {{performances}} beauty, aristocracy, {{and tragedy}} all blended into one. Her role as Chhoti Bahu, in Guru Dutt's Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam {{is considered to}} be one of the best performances in Indian Cinema. The role of Chhoti Bahu, in Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam was <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to Kumari's own tragic life. Like the character of Chhoti Bahu, in real life too, Meena Kumari became addicted to alcohol. Kumari's life and prosperous career were marred by heavy drinking, troubled relationships, an ensuing deteriorating health, which ultimately led to her death from liver cirrhosis in 1972.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, 1849, a Mississippi River levee breach upriver {{from the}} city (around modern River Ridge, Louisiana) created the worst {{flooding}} the city had ever seen. The flood, known as at Sauvé's Crevasse, left 12,000 people homeless. While New Orleans has experienced numerous floods large and small in its history, the flood of 1849 was of a more disastrous scale than any save the flooding after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. New Orleans has not experienced flooding from the Mississippi River since Sauvé's Crevasse, although it came <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.|$|E
25|$|After {{fending off}} another coordinated assault, the Marines were low on ammunition, {{and all of}} them had been wounded by that point. While the {{frustrated}} pilots circled the area without being able to see clear targets, a C-47 deployed flares for illumination at around 01:00. Early into the morning, as Marines traded taunts with the enemy, the pilots began <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> attack missions, including one Air Force F105, Marine F8U Crusaders, and helicopter gunships. Armed UH-1Es stayed with the Marines through the morning {{until the end of the}} battle, often serving as airborne forward air controllers with the aid of Howard and his red-filtered flashlight.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Montereau (18 February 1814) {{was fought}} during the War of the Sixth Coalition between an Imperial French army led by Emperor Napoleon and a corps of Austrians and Württembergers {{commanded}} by Crown Prince Frederick William of Württemberg. While Napoleon's army mauled an Allied army under Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, the main Allied army commanded by Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg advanced {{to a position}} <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to Paris. Gathering up his outnumbered forces, Napoleon rushed his soldiers south to deal with Schwarzenberg. Hearing of {{the approach of the}} French emperor, the Allied commander ordered a withdrawal, but 17 February saw his rear guards overrun or brushed aside.|$|E
25|$|From 1635 to 1748, Richelieu and Louis XIV {{undertook}} {{an expansion}} of the frontiers of the kingdom towards the north and towards the Rhine. Their aim was to check the aspiration of the Austrian royal house towards its own predominance in Europe. The loss of French Flanders (1526) had brought the frontier <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to the French capital. Alsace, Artois and Franche-Comté were annexed between 1648 and 1697. The Duchy of Lorraine remained some time an enclave in the French kingdom before it too was incorporated in 1766. This and the purchase of Corsica in 1768 brought the territory of the kingdom into a consolidated block.|$|E
25|$|By midnight all was quiet, but {{the ship}} was still labouring to rejoin {{the main part of}} the convoy. Steaming on slowly, Saturday turned into Sunday. Sunday 26 October would be a day that the crew of the English Trader would never forget. Between 1 am and 1.30 am, {{the ship was}} {{struggling}} against a strong ebbing tide, which in turn forced her <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to the sandbanks of Hammond Knoll. At around 1.45 am the crew felt a slight jolt followed by a more severe jolt. This flung the ship forward followed by loud grinding, crunching and scraping of metal. Then there was silence. The ship had run aground on Hammond Knoll.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{a mediocre}} {{record in the}} league, Baumgart' contact was {{extended}} another year until June 2010. Promotion was still the target for Baumgart's team, but after the winterbreak {{the distance to the}} promotion spot had increased so much that the board decided to let Baumgart go. Carsten Müller was appointed as an interim manager with the goal of at least winning the Landespokal, but even that failed. For the following season, Magdeburg signed Ruud Kaiser as manager, tasked with building a team capable of winning the league within two years. However, after a string of bad results brought the side <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to relegation, Kaiser was let go and succeeded by Wolfgang Sandhowe.|$|E
25|$|The Whiskey Rebellion {{happened}} in 1794—when {{settlers in the}} Monongahela Valley of western Pennsylvania protested against the new federal tax on whiskey, which the settlers shipped across the mountains to earn money. It was the first serious test of the federal government. Washington ordered federal marshals to serve court orders requiring the tax protesters to appear in federal district court. By August 1794, the protests became <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to outright rebellion, and on August 7, several thousand armed settlers gathered near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Washington then invoked the Militia Law of 1792 to summon the militias of several states. A force of 13,000 men was organized, and Washington personally led it to Western Pennsylvania. The revolt immediately collapsed, {{and there was no}} violence.|$|E
25|$|France's prime minister, Cardinal Fleury, saw the Polish {{struggle}} as {{a chance}} to strike at the Austrian monarchy in the west without seeming to be the aggressor. While he cared little for who should become King of Poland, the cause of the King's father-in-law was a sympathetic one. He also hoped to use the war to humble Austria, and perhaps secure the long-desired Duchy of Lorraine from Duke Francis Stephen, who was unofficially betrothed to Emperor Charles's daughter and heir Maria Theresa. Their marriage would bring Austrian power <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to France. Fleury's diplomatic moves brought into the war additional powers with no interest in Polish affairs and politics, most notably Spain and King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, who was also Duke of Savoy.|$|E
25|$|Baquedano {{wanted to}} check out the troops situation, and moved <b>dangerously</b> <b>close</b> to the front line. Apparently, Peruvian {{soldiers}} fired upon Baquedano, and their shots were answered by the Chileans. In shot time, the cross fire became general, and the battle started unexpectedly at 14:00 hrs., catching both sides unprepared. However, the Chilean right was attacked by Cáceres' Corps. The Chilean battleships began to fire upon the Peruvians trying to ease the pressure. Cáceres saw the chance to destroy Lagos' division and sent the Guardia Chalaca and Guarnición de Marina battalions against Barceló, while a fraction of Col. Suárez' Corps engaged Urriola, who wasn't formed yet. The strength of the attack forced the Chileans to retreat. At this time, Lynch wasn't yet in position, so the cavalry and the artillery withdrew from the front line.|$|E
