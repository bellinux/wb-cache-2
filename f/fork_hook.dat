"Mother," [...] he said, after pondering {{in silence}} for a few moments, and taking her hand in his while he slipped the handless arm round her waist, [...] "the news is indeed serious, but our Father whom you have trusted so long will not fail us now. Happily it is my right hand that has been spared, and wonders, you know, may be wrought with a strong right hand, {{especially}} if assisted by a strong left stump, into which spoons, <b>forks,</b> <b>hooks,</b> and all manner of ingenious contrivances can be fitted. Now, cheer up, little mother, and I'll tell you what we will do. But first, is there nothing left? Do the creditors take everything?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the winter}} of 1872-73, after emigrating to Boston, Bell became a {{professor}} of elocution at Boston University. He continued research into phonetics and resumed the electrical experiments he had begun in Bath and London towards improving the telegraph. Bell replicated and enlarged upon Helmholtz's tuning fork sounder experiments (see Fig. 3). These experiments involved running an electric current through a tuning fork attached to a wire that dipped in liquid as the fork vibrated. The tone of the fork was then replicated in another <b>fork</b> <b>hooked</b> up into the circuit. These experiments, with a vibrating wire touching a liquid, anticipated the liquid transmitter of Bell's telephone in March, 1876 three years later. (Compare Fig. 3 and Fig. 7, for example.) ...|$|R
40|$|The tetraphyllidean metacestode {{diversity}} of 310 teleost fishes, including 87 species from 31 families, was examined from Heron Island, The Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Eleven metacestode 2 ̆ 7 types 2 ̆ 7 were {{identified with the}} use of light microscopy. Host-specificity varied greatly among metacestode types. Incorporation of in vitro cultivation allowed generic identification for some types. Types 1 and 2 belong to Uncibilocularis Southwell, 1925, and have triloculate bothridia and one pair of <b>forked</b> <b>hooks</b> with unequal prongs; Type 3 has quadriloculate bothridia. Hook development was insufficient to determine in which genus, Acanthobothrium van Beneden, 1849 or Calliobothrium van Beneden, 1850, this type may belong. Type 4 has unilocular bothridia with simple edges and belongs to Anthobothrium van Beneden, 1850. Type 5 has multiloculated bothridia which are invaginated within pouches. This type belongs to the Rhinebothriinae although its generic identity cannot be determined. The bothridia of Type 5 everted within 24 hours of in vitro cultivation and revealed the presence of two forms, one having 48 loculi per bothridium, the other 72 per bothridium. In vitro studies provide additional support for existing theories of onchobothriid scolex development...|$|R

All species respond well to flies or artificial baits. Only artificial lures and flies allowed on the Oak Grove <b>Fork,</b> with barbless <b>hooks.</b>|$|R
40|$|The avialan taxon Apsaravis ukhaana {{from the}} Late Cretaceous of {{southern}} Mongolia is completely described and its phylogenetic position is evaluated. Apsaravis ukhaana is from continental sandstones exposed at the locality of Ukhaa Tolgod, Omnogov Aimag, Mongolia. The holotype specimen {{consists of the}} nearly complete, articulated skeleton of a small volant avialan. Apsaravis ukhaana is unambiguously differentiated from other avialans based on the pres-ence of several unique morphologies: a strong tubercle on the proximal humerus, a hypertro-phied trochanteric crest on the femur, and extremely well-projected posterior wings of a surface of the distal tibiotarsus that in Aves articulates with the tibial cartilage. Ten other homoplastic characters optimize as autapomorphies of Apsaravis ukhaana in the phylogenetic analysis. They are as follows: ossified mandibular symphysis; dentary strongly <b>forked</b> posteriorly; <b>hooked</b> acromion process on scapula; highly angled dorsal condyle of humerus; humeral con-dyles weakly defined; distal edge of humerus angling strongly ventrally; humerus flared dor-soventrally at its distal terminus; lateral condyle of tibiotarsus wider than medial one; neither condyle of tibiotarsus tapering toward the midline; and metatarsal II trochlea rounded rather than ginglymoid. Phylogenetic placement of Apsaravis ukhaana as the sister taxon of Hesperornithes 1 Aves resulted from analysis of 202 characters scored for 17 avialan ingroup taxa. The implications of Apsaravis ukhaana, {{and the results of}} the phylogenetic analysis, for the evolution of flight after its origin and character support for enantiornithine monophyly are extensively discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Derek Flint was the {{creation}} of Hal Fimberg, whose writing credentials, though sparse, did go back quite a few years. Whether it was in keeping with a growing trend to try to 'out-Bond Bond' or, more likely, to spoof the very macho Double-0 agent, Flint was the best at whatever he did and he did a lot. The abilities and achievements of Derek Flint are far too numerous to list here. Just a few include a black belt in Judo, Olympic medals in at least 5 different events, degrees from 17 different universities, creation of highly prized paintings, and the ability to speak fluently in 45 languages and dialects. Derek Flint created the sonic amplifier, which was a tuning fork shaped brass <b>fork</b> that <b>hooks</b> into a cigarette lighter and could be seen moving a pool cue ball around on the table by sonic force. By adjusting the meter to a specific pitch he is able to explode the ball by mere sonic force. This is perhaps a bit of foreshadowing of events to come. Flint uses his belt buckle/sonic manipulator to shatter the glass to his cell and free himself and before both are frozen in suspended animation. ...later on, in the Virgin Islands, Flint's escape from the space capsule to the Orbiting Space Platform. Using one secret device, Derek Flint ensnares General Carter with a Cigarette Lighter Grappling Hook gun. Flint exits the space capsule as easily as jumping out of a plane and floats towards the space station using his sonic vibrator to propel himself in the correct direction. Flint, using his all-in-one device, launches a grappling hook and manages to slide along his way across the tight rope from one roof top to another.. and once again retracting his grappling hook device; he escapes to safely via a rooftop air shaft.|$|R
60|$|The swede-field {{in which}} she and her {{companion}} were set hacking was a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground of the farm, rising above stony lanchets or lynchets--the outcrop of siliceous veins in the chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose white flints in bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes. The upper half of each turnip had been eaten off by the live-stock, {{and it was the}} business of the two women to grub up the lower or earthy half of the root with a <b>hooked</b> <b>fork</b> called a hacker, that it might be eaten also. Every leaf of the vegetable having already been consumed, the whole field was in colour a desolate drab; it was a complexion without features, as if a face, from chin to brow, should be only an expanse of skin. The sky wore, in another colour, the same likeness; a white vacuity of countenance with the lineaments gone. So these two upper and nether visages confronted each other all day long, the white face looking down on the brown face, and the brown face looking up at the white face, without anything standing between them but the two girls crawling over the surface of the former like flies.|$|R
