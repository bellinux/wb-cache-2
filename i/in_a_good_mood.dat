25|$|The {{greatest}} life threat due to GHB overdose (with {{or without}} other substances) is respiratory arrest. Other relatively common {{causes of death}} due to GHB ingestion include aspiration of vomitus, positional asphyxia, and trauma sustained while intoxicated (e.g., motor vehicle accidents while {{driving under the influence}} of GHB). The risk of aspiration pneumonia and positional asphyxia risk can be reduced by laying the patient down in the recovery position. People are most likely to vomit as they become unconscious, and as they wake up. It is important to keep the victim awake and moving, who must not be left alone due to the risk of death through vomiting. Frequently they will be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>mood</b> but this does not mean they are not in danger. GHB overdose is a medical emergency and immediate assessment in an emergency department is needed.|$|E

500|$|In 1955, O'Hara {{made her}} fourth picture with Ford, The Long Gray Line, which she {{considered}} being [...] "by {{far the most}} difficult" [...] due to declining relations with John Ford. John Wayne had originally intended co-starring, but due to a conflicting schedule O'Hara recommended Tyrone Power in replacement. Malone notes that the Irish accents by O'Hara and Power are overdone, {{and that there is}} little trace of a Donegal accent in it. The film production marked the lowest point of O'Hara's relationship with Ford, and each day he would greet her with [...] "Well, did Herself have a good shit this morning?". He would ask the crew if she was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>mood,</b> and if that was the case, he would say [...] "then we're going to have a horrible day" [...] and vice versa. He would provoke her by telling her to [...] "move her fat Irish ass". Their relationship deteriorated further when O'Hara reportedly saw him kissing an actor on set, and Ford knew that she thought he was a closeted homosexual. In The Magnificent Matador, O'Hara played a spoiled, wealthy American who {{falls in love with a}} brooding, tormented, about-to-retire matador (Anthony Quinn) in Mexico. Ava Gardner, who was dating a bullfighter in real life, Luis Miguel Dominguín, and Lana Turner were considered for O'Hara's part of Karen Harrison. The film was panned by the critics. One of her best-known roles came later year, playing Lady Godiva in Lady Godiva of Coventry. Contrary to what Universal claimed to the press, O'Hara was not nude in the film, wearing a [...] "full-length body leotard and underwear that was concealed by my long tresses".|$|E

She explained it was inspired by [...] "me imagining [...] and any female musician touring the world.

[...] On March 2, 2011, the single's cover art, in which Spears appears sitting on a couch in a sweater and heels, was posted at Deezer.com. This was followed by a 30-second snippet of the song, which appeared at Amazon.de.

Following the announcement, Kesha spoke to MTV News stating that [...] "I consider myself a songwriter before and above everything else, so it's an honor to write for one of pop music's biggest icons."

2500|$|In an {{interview}} in 1986, Prince Pujie told Behr: [...] "Puyi constantly talked about going to England and becoming an Oxford student, like Johnston." [...] On 4June 1922, Puyi attempted {{to escape from the}} Forbidden City, having decided that {{he wanted to go to}} study at Oxford, and planned to issue an open letter to [...] "the people of China" [...] renouncing the title of Emperor before leaving for Oxford. The escape attempt failed when Johnston vetoed it and refused to call a taxi and Puyi was too frightened to live on the streets of Beijing on his own. Pujie said about Puyi’s escape attempt: “Puyi’s decision had nothing to do with the impending marriage. He felt cooped up, and wanted out.” Johnston later recounted his time as Puyi's tutor between 19191924 in his 1934 book Twilight in the Forbidden City, which is one of main sources of information about Puyi's life in this period, though Behr cautioned that Johnston painted an idealised picture of Puyi in his book, avoiding all mention of Puyi's sexuality, that he was only an average student, his erratic mood swings, and the practice of eunuch-flogging. Pujie told Behr about Puyi's moods: [...] "When he was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>mood,</b> everything was fine, and he was a charming companion. If something upset him, his dark side would emerge." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 3 September, the Luftwaffe {{began its}} major effort {{against the city}} by {{beginning}} several destructive raids. The Battle of Stalingrad initiated a regression in air tactics back to the First World War, where a few flights of aircraft made pin-point attacks against enemy infantry and acted {{as an extension of}} the infantry. The Ju 87 units usually flew four sorties per day. Their bombing was so accurate that Richthofen commented in his diary that they dropped bombs within hand-grenade distances. In October, the Romanian Air Corps arrived (180 aircraft) which attacked rail targets north east of Stalingrad and eased the air situation. Logistics were stretched and the front in Stalingrad formed into a stalemate, with the Germans having taken central and southern Stalingrad. With no reinforcements, and having lost 14 percent of his strength, Richthofen turned to support the German Army in the Caucasus. Göring ordered him to concentrate on Stalingrad, but Richthofen refused to return. This prompted a meeting between Hitler, Jeschnonnek and Göring on 15 October. Hitler was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>mood,</b> and he had taken personal command of Army Group Bs operations in the Caucasus on 9 September. He supported Richthofen and gave him the authority to continue, partly in the belief that the battle in Stalingrad was nearly over. Richthofen accused the army of [...] "constipation" [...] in Stalingrad on 22 September and was critical of its vacillation a month earlier.|$|E
2500|$|Michaels {{states in}} Heartbreak & Triumph that during {{planning}} {{he was told}} [...] "'This cannot be discussed with anyone.

We sat down and talked", and [...] "Pat was in the room with us, and {{he had no idea what}} was going to happen. He had a strong relationship with Bret. He wouldn't have done it, and Vince knew that. That's why he didn't tell Pat...". However, in Dave Meltzer's online account of events before, during, and after the Screwjob, he states [...] "Vince McMahon held a meeting at the hotel with Jim Ross, Jim Cornette, Pat Patterson and Michaels. Reports are that at least two of the aforementioned names looked extremely uncomfortable leaving the meeting" [...] which suggests that Patterson may in fact have been in on the Screwjob. This is corroborated by a Pro Wrestling Torch article from November 15, 1997 by Wade Keller which states, [...] "However, a two-hour meeting was held on the second floor of the Montreal Marriott on Saturday night with McMahon, Jim Ross, Pat Patterson, Jim Cornette, and Michaels. Bret was wrestling that night in Detroit. There is some belief that at this meeting McMahon proposed the idea of the finish to whoever of that group wasn't already in on it. Ross and Patterson entered the meeting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>mood</b> and when they were seen in the hotel lobby afterwards, were said to be irritable, forlorn, and shaken." ...|$|E

6000|$|Rosamond and Mary {{had been}} talking faster than their male friends. They {{did not think of}} sitting down, but stood at the toilet-table near the window while Rosamond took off her hat, {{adjusted}} her veil, and applied little touches of her finger-tips to her hair--hair of infantine fairness, neither flaxen nor yellow. Mary Garth seemed all the plainer standing at an angle between the two nymphs--the one in the glass, and the one out of it, who looked at each other with eyes of heavenly blue, deep enough to hold the most exquisite meanings an ingenious beholder could put into them, and deep enough to hide the meanings of the owner if these should happen to be less exquisite. Only a few children in Middlemarch looked blond by the side of Rosamond, and the slim figure displayed by her riding-habit had delicate undulations. In fact, most men in Middlemarch, except her brothers, held that Miss Vincy was the best girl in the world, and some called her an angel. Mary Garth, on the contrary, had the aspect of an ordinary sinner: she was brown; her curly dark hair was rough and stubborn; her stature was low; and it would not be true to declare, in satisfactory antithesis, that she had all the virtues. Plainness has its peculiar temptations and vices quite as much as beauty; it is apt either to feign amiability, or, not feigning it, to show all the repulsiveness of discontent: at any rate, to be called an ugly thing in contrast with that lovely creature your companion, is apt to produce some effect beyond a sense of fine veracity and fitness in the phrase. At the age of two-and-twenty Mary had certainly not attained that perfect good sense and good principle which are usually recommended to the less fortunate girl, as if they were to be obtained in quantities ready mixed, with a flavor of resignation as required. Her shrewdness had a streak of satiric bitterness continually renewed and never carried utterly out of sight, except by a strong current of gratitude towards those who, instead of telling her that she ought to be contented, did something to make her so. Advancing womanhood had tempered her plainness, which was of a good human sort, such as the mothers of our race have very commonly worn in all latitudes under a more or less becoming headgear. Rembrandt would have painted her with pleasure, and would have made her broad features look out of the canvas with intelligent honesty. For honesty, truth-telling fairness, was Mary's reigning virtue: she neither tried to create illusions, nor indulged in them for her own behoof, and when she was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>mood</b> she had humor enough in her to laugh at herself. When she and Rosamond happened both to be reflected in the glass, she said, laughingly-- ...|$|E
