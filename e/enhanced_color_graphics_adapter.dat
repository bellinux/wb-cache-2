5000|$|The <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> page {{elsewhere}} on Wikipedia calls this mode [...] "The 160×100 16 color mode".|$|R
50|$|<b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> {{text and}} <b>graphics</b> modes. Text modes use EGA 14-pixel font and have 400 rows of pixels.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> uses a {{standard}} DE-9 connector for direct-drive video (to an RGBI monitor). The connector {{on the card}} is female and {{the one on the}} monitor cable is male.|$|R
5000|$|When using IBM's <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) with NTSC TV-out the {{separation}} between luminance and chrominance is imperfect, yielding cross-color artifacts, or color [...] "smearing". This is especially a problem with 80-column text.|$|R
5000|$|A low-resolution 160 x 100 x 16 <b>color</b> <b>graphics</b> mode unofficially called [...] "XCGA" [...] and not {{supported}} in BIOS (interrupt 10h) also existed and had limited popularity amongst enthusiasts for a while. Technically this mode worked like color text mode. (see <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter.)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Tandy <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (TGA) is a {{computer}} display standard for an IBM PC compatible video adapter that improved on IBM's <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) technology. Whereas CGA could display only four colors at a time at a screen resolution of 320×200 pixels, a TGA adapter could display up to 16 colors.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its native 640 x 480 mode, the PGC optionally supported the documented text and graphics modes of the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter,</b> which could be enabled using an onboard jumper. However, it was only partly register-compatible with CGA.|$|R
25|$|Most Wang PCs were {{released}} with a monochrome <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> that supported a single video mode with text and graphics planes {{that could be}} scrolled independently, unlike IBM-compatible PCs of the time which required selecting a specific video mode to allow <b>graphics.</b> A <b>color</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> and Wang-branded <b>color</b> monitor were also available.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} IBM PC contained this font as a 9×14 pixels-per-character font {{stored in}} the ROM of the IBM Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) and an 8×8 pixels-per-character font of the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) cards. The IBM Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) contained an 8×14 pixels-per-character version, and the VGA contained a 9×16 version.|$|R
50|$|Its successor, the dual-{{processor}} QX-16, added a 16-bit Intel {{processor with}} <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> enabling it to also boot MS-DOS 2.11. The {{case of the}} QX-16 was enlarged to provide enough physical space for an internal hard-drive {{in contrast to the}} QX-10's dual-floppy configuration.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA), {{originally}} {{also called}} the Color/Graphics Adapter or IBM Color/Graphics Monitor Adapter, introduced in 1981, was IBM's first graphics card and first color display card for the IBM PC. For this reason, it also became that computer's first color computer display standard.|$|R
50|$|Non-square pixels arise {{often in}} early digital TV standards, related to {{digitalization}} of analog TV signals - whose {{horizontal and vertical}} resolutions differ and are thus best described by non-square pixels - and also in some digital videocameras and computer display modes, such as <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA). Today they arise particularly in transcoding between resolutions with different SARs.|$|R
5000|$|Since XCGA was {{technically}} a color text mode, {{the first}} byte {{in a big}} pixel was actually the top two scanlines of a [...] "text graphics" [...] character in video ROM. As in color text mode the second byte stored the foreground color in the low nibble and the background color in the high nibble. (see <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter.)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|... fixed palette {{selection}}: A given {{display adapter}} {{can offer a}} fixed color selection when its hardware registers are appropriately set. For example, the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA), {{in one of the}} standard graphics modes, can be set to show the so-called palette #1 or the palette #2: two combinations of 3 fixed colors and one user-defined background color each.|$|R
50|$|In late 1982, IBM {{began work}} on the PCjr, a lower-priced variant of the IBM Personal Computer with {{improved}} graphics and sound. The PCjr's Video Gate Array video adapter could display up to 16 colors at a time—a major improvement over the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter's</b> four-color limit. The new sound chip, too, could output {{a wider range of}} tones than the PC speaker.|$|R
5000|$|Non-square pixels arise {{often in}} early digital TV standards, related to {{digitalization}} of analog TV signals - whose vertical and [...] "effective" [...] horizontal resolutions differ {{and are thus}} best described by non-square pixels - and also in some digital videocameras and computer display modes, such as <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA). Today they arise also in transcoding between resolutions with different SARs.|$|R
50|$|The 5151 was {{designed}} {{to work with the}} PC's Monochrome Display <b>Adapter</b> (MDA) text-only <b>graphics</b> card, but the third-party Hercules Graphics Card became a popular companion to the 5151 screen because of the Hercules' comparatively high-resolution bitmapped 720×348 pixel monochrome graphics capability, much used for business presentation graphics generated from spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3. This was much higher resolution than the alternative IBM <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> 320×200 pixel, or 640×200 pixel graphic standard. It could also run most programs written for the CGA card's standard graphics modes. Monochrome monitors continued to be used, even after the introduction of higher resolution <b>color</b> IBM <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> and Video <b>Graphics</b> Array standards in the late 1980s, for dual-monitor applications.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the last}} video systems where text semigraphics were a useful option was the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA). This <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> for early IBM-PCs only {{supported}} four colors in its high-resolution graphics mode, but in text mode it could display 16 different colors. Although the CGA adapter's font ROM did not contain all of the otherwise typical text semigraphics characters, it was still possible to create a 160 × 100 CGA text semigraphics mode using a semi-documented trick. With this trick, much more colorful games (like Moon bugs http://www.myabandonware.com/game/moon-bugs-2l) could be programmed on CGA-equipped PCs.|$|R
50|$|The Premium, 256TC and Teleterm models {{released}} in 1986 incorporated colour {{on the main}} board and used a different colour design compared to the earlier model and was not compatible for the resultant colours that were produced but application and system software will work on either hardware designs. The later colour design was largely compatible with the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> used on the IBM PC where 4 bits {{were used for the}} foreground and another 4 bits for the background colours.|$|R
50|$|The FriendlySoft {{company was}} started by an {{investor}} named Michael Yaw, who also owned several Domino's Pizza stores. The software was written {{by a team of}} four programmers, who were paid royalties on the sales. Development was done on some of the earlier IBM PCs, which were so new at the time that they had to be ordered. One of the computers purchased was a PC with a CGA card (<b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter),</b> which was an innovation. Over 29,000 copies of the original FriendlyWare were eventually sold.|$|R
5000|$|The first color capable {{video card}} for the IBM PC family was the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA), which {{includes}} two graphic modes: 320×200 pixels with four colors (two bits per pixel) and 640×200 pixels black-and-white (one bit per pixel). The card {{as a whole}} implemented the [...] "digital RGBI" [...] 16-color space (i.e. each primary color (red, green, and blue) could be either on or off for a given pixel, and an additional intensity bit would brighten all three primaries if it was turned on for a pixel.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the first}} IBM PC was {{designed}} in 1980, it included a [...] "peseta symbol" [...] "Pts" [...] in the ROM of the Monochrome Display <b>Adapter</b> (MDA) and <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) video output cards' hardware, with the code number 158. This original character set chart {{later became the}} MS-DOS code page 437. Some spreadsheet software for PC under MS-DOS, as Lotus 1-2-3, employed this character as the peseta symbol in their Spanish editions. Subsequent international MS-DOS code pages, like code page 850 and others, deprecated this character in favour of some other national characters.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Compaq Deskpro (released in 1984), {{available in}} several disk configurations, was an XT-class PC {{equipped with an}} 8 MHz 8086 CPU and Compaq's unique display hardware that combined <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> <b>graphics</b> with high resolution Monochrome Display Adapter text. As a result, it was both considerably faster than the IBM PC and had a much better quality text display compared to an IBM PC equipped with graphics. Like the earlier Compaq Portable, its hardware and BIOS was 100% compatible with the IBM PC Model 5150 (a characteristic that few other PC workalikes shared so soon after {{the establishment of the}} IBM standard).|$|R
2500|$|When {{the first}} IBM PC was {{designed}} in 1980, it included a [...] "peseta symbol" [...] "Pts" [...] in the ROM of the Monochrome Display <b>Adapter</b> (MDA) and <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) video output cards' hardware, with the code number 158. This original character set chart {{later became the}} MS-DOS code page 437.

50|$|Like the IBM PC {{with the}} {{contemporary}} <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter,</b> the video {{output of the}} BBC Micro could be switched by software between a number of display modes. These varied between 20 and 40-column text suitable for a domestic TV, to 80-column text best viewed with a high-quality RGB-connected monitor (The 80-column mode was often too blurred to view when using a domestic TV via the UHF output). The variety of modes offered applications a flexible compromise between colour depth, resolution and memory economy. In the first models, the OS and applications were left with the RAM {{left over from the}} display mode.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} {{peripheral}} chip were introduced by 1978. The MC6840 programmable counter had three 16-bit binary counters {{that could be}} used for frequency measurement, event counting, or interval measurement. The MC6844 Direct Memory Access Controller could transfer data from an I/O controller to RAM without loading down the MC6800 microprocessor. The MC6845 CRT Controller provided the control logic for a character based computer terminal. The 6845 had support for a light pen, an alternative to a computer mouse. This was a very popular chip and was even used in the original IBM PC Monochrome Display Adapter with the Intel 8088 16-bit microprocessor in 1981, and in the follow-up IBM <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> for the original PC and successors; the IBM Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> card contained custom IBM chips that emulated the Motorola 6845, with minor differences.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} home computers (such as the TRS-80 and Commodore PET) were limited to monochrome CRT displays, but color display capability was already a standard feature of the pioneering Apple II, introduced in 1977, and the specialty of the more graphically sophisticated Atari 800, introduced in 1979. Either computer could {{be connected to the}} antenna terminals of an ordinary color TV set or used with a purpose-made CRT color monitor for optimum resolution and color quality. Lagging several years behind, in 1981 IBM introduced the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter,</b> which could display four colors with a resolution of 320 x 200 pixels, or it could produce 640 x 200 pixels with two colors. In 1984 IBM introduced the Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> which was capable of producing 16 colors and had a resolution of 640 x 350.|$|R
50|$|The XT {{had eight}} slots. Two {{were behind the}} floppy drive and shorter than PC's slots. The other six fit into the same space as the PC's five slots. Most PC cards would not fit into the two short slots, and some would not fit into the six standard-length, but narrower, slots, {{particularly}} cards with double boards on them. The floppy and hard drive adapters, the serial port card, and nearly always a display adapter board occupied slots. The basic specification was soon upgraded to have 256 KB of RAM as standard. Expansion slots {{could be used for}} I/O devices or for memory expansion. Available Video cards were initially the Monochrome Display <b>Adapter</b> (MDA) and <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) (the same two cards that were available for the type 5150 PC), with Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) and Professional Graphics Controller (PGC) becoming available in 1984.|$|R
2500|$|The {{design of}} the {{original}} IBM PC placed the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) memory map and other hardware in the 384 KB upper memory area (UMA). The need for more RAM grew faster than the needs of hardware to utilize the reserved addresses, which resulted in RAM eventually being mapped into these unused upper areas to utilize all available addressable space. This introduced a reserved [...] "hole" [...] (or several holes) into the set of addresses occupied by hardware {{that could be used}} for arbitrary data. Avoiding such a hole was difficult and ugly and not supported by DOS or most programs that could run on it. Later, space between the holes would be used as upper memory blocks (UMBs).|$|R
50|$|Long {{after its}} prime, the Hercules card {{continued}} to be popular for dual-monitor setups alongside another (<b>color)</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter.</b> Certain software detected the presence of both video systems, and used the monochrome display for extra data display, while running the application on the other screen - for example, a CAD work area would be displayed on the main (non-Hercules driven) screen, {{and a list of}} drawing commands would be shown on the HGC-driven monochrome screen. Some software debuggers could take advantage of an HGC to run the main program on the color monitor and the debugger on the HGC. Later on, the multi-monitor trick became obsolete with OS-related improvements such as the introduction of GUIs for debug commands as a software analogy for debug command modules.|$|R
50|$|King's Quest was {{innovative}} {{in its use}} of 16-color graphics for the IBM PC platform. The game {{used the}} PCjr and Tandy 1000's Video Gate Array and enhanced sound, and those with the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> computers could display 16-color <b>graphics</b> with artifact <b>colors</b> on a composite color monitor or television. Selecting 'RGB mode' at the title screen would instead result in the usual 320&times;200 CGA graphics mode limited to 4 colors. In this mode, dithering was employed to simulate extra colors. Like previous static-screen Sierra adventures, King's Quest used vector graphics rather than pre-rendered bitmaps which would take far too much disk space. Each screen is drawn line-by-line and painted in. This technique was used on all Sierra adventure games up to King's Quest V.|$|R
5000|$|For PC users {{requiring}} bitmapped <b>graphics</b> and/or <b>color,</b> IBM offered its <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA, also CGA card), launched at {{the same}} time as MDA. CGA was much less popular than MDA at first; the lower resolution of its text mode characters (as compared to MDA) and absence of a printer port, which was included on the original MDA card, made CGA cards less attractive for business use. PC Magazine reported in June 1983 that while [...] "the IBM monochrome display is absolutely beautiful for text and wonderfully easy on the eyes, but is limited to simple character graphics. Text quality on displays connected to the color/graphics adapter ... is at best of medium quality and is conducive to eyestrain over the long haul".|$|R
5000|$|IBM {{recognized}} {{soon after}} the IBM PC's release in 1981 that its five 8-bit [...] "I/O channel" [...] expansion slots (later named Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) by IBM's competitors) were insufficient. An internal IBM publication stated in October 1981 about the number that [...] "In my opinion, {{it could be a}} problem", reporting that others within IBM advised swapping cards if necessary. Virtually every PC required at least a display adapter card and a floppy disk controller card, leaving only three slots available for a parallel printer port card (if the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> was used), a serial port card, memory expansion boards, a 3rd-party hard disk controller card, a second display adapter card, or possible other special adapter cards.|$|R
