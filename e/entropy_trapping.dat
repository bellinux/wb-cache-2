40|$|This paper aims {{to propose}} an {{effective}} paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) predictor {{which is based}} on the analysis of the heart rate variability (HRV) signal. Predicting the onset of PAF, based on non-invasive techniques, is clinically important and can be invaluable in order to avoid useless therapeutic interventions and to minimize the risks for the patients. This method consists of four steps: Preprocessing, feature extraction, feature reduction, and classification. In the first step, the QRS complexes are detected from the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and then the HRV signal is extracted. In the next step, the recurrence plot (RP) of HRV signal is obtained and six features are extracted to characterize the basic patterns of the RP. These features consist of length of longest diagonal segments, average length of the diagonal lines, <b>entropy,</b> <b>trapping</b> time, length of longest vertical line, and recurrence trend. In the third step, these features are reduced to three features by the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) technique. Using LDA not only reduces the number of the input features, but also increases the classification accuracy by selecting the most discriminating features. Finally, a support vector machine-based classifier is used to classify the HRV signals. The performance of the proposed method in prediction of PAF episodes was evaluated using the Atrial Fibrillation Prediction Database which consists of both 30 -minutes ECG recordings end just prior to the onset of PAF and segments at least 45 min distant from any PAF events. The obtained sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictivity were 96. 55 %, 100 %, and 100 %, respectively...|$|E

We reformulate the one-body Shannon information entropy {{in terms of the}} one-body probability density. The minimum limit of the entropy uncertainty relation (EUR) is approached by making $N$ very small in our numerical work. We examine the effect of correlations in the calculation of information entropy. Comparison with the mean-field result shows that the correlated basis function is indeed required to characterize the important features of the information entropies. We also accurately calculate the point of critical instability of an attractive BEC, which is in close agreement with the experimental value. Next we calculate two-body entropies in position and momentum spaces and study quantum correlations in the attractive BEC. Comment: Accepted in Physical Review A (2013...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} protoneutron star properties within {{a modified version}} of the quark coupling model (QMC) that incorporates a omega-rho interaction plus kaon condensed matter at finite temperature. Fixed <b>entropy</b> and <b>trapped</b> neutrinos are taken into account. Our results are compared with the ones obtained with the GM 1 parametrization of the non-linear Walecka model for similar values of the symmetry energy slope. Contrary to GM 1, within the QMC the formation of low mass black-holes during cooling are not probable. It is shown that the evolution of the protoneutron star may include the melting of the kaon condensate driven by the neutrino diffusion, followed by the formation of a second condensate after cooling. The signature of this complex proccess could be a neutrino signal followed by a gamma ray burst. We have seen that both models can, in general, describe very massive stars.

40|$|We {{calculate}} Shannon information <b>entropy</b> of <b>trapped</b> interacting bosons in {{both the}} position and momentum spaces, S_r and S_k respectively. The total entropy maintains the fuctional form S=a + b N for repulsive bosons. At the noninteracting limit the lower bound of entropic uncertainty relation is also satisfied whereas the diverging behavior of S_r and S_k at the critical point of collapse for attractive condensate accurately calculates the stability factor. Next we study the dynamics of Shannon information entropy with varying interparticle potential. We numerically solve the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation and study the influence of increasing nonlinearity in the dynamics of entropy uncertainty relation (EUR). We observe that for small nonlinearity the dynamics is regular. With increase in nonlinearity although Shannon entropy shows large variation in amplitude of the oscillation, the EUR is maintained throughout time for all cases and it confirms its generality. We also study the dynamics in a very tight trap when the condensate becomes highly correlated and strongly inhomogeneous. Time evolution of total entropy exhibits aperiodic and fluctuating nature in very tight trap. We also calculate Landsberg's order parameter for various interaction strengths which supports earlier observation that entropy and order are decoupled.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that the liquid properties in a strongly confined {{system can be}} very different from their ordinary behaviors in an extended system, due to the competition between the thermal energy and the interaction energy. Here we show that, in a low-dimensional self-assembled dipolar crystal, the parabolic optical confinement potential can also strongly affect the quantum many-body properties in the low temperature regime. For example, by changing the confinement aspect ratio, the bulk of the system can undergo a quantum phase transition between a liquid state and a solid state via a nonmonotonic pattern formation of the domain wall. Furthermore, the <b>entropy</b> of a <b>trapped</b> dipolar crystal can be much larger than the liquid state in the weak dipole limit, indicating an intrinsic polarization cooling mechanism via increasing the external field.

40|$|Literature {{confirms}} {{the effects of}} vision and stance on body sway and indicates possible interactions between the two. However, no {{attempts have been made}} to systematically compare the effect of vision on the different types of stance which are frequently used in clinical and research practice. The biomechanical changes that occur after changing shape and size of the support surface suggest possible sensory re-weighting might take place. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of vision on body sway in relation to different stance configurations and width. Thirty-eight volunteers performed four quiet stance configurations (parallel, semi-tandem, tandem and single leg), repeating them with open and closed eyes. Traditional parameters, recurrence quantification analysis and sample entropy were analyzed from the CoP trajectory signal. Traditional and recurrence quantification analysis parameters were affected by vision removal and stance type. Exceptions were frequency of oscillation, <b>entropy</b> and <b>trapping</b> time. The most prominent effect of vision elimination on traditional parameters was observed for narrower stances. A significant interaction effect between vision removal and stance type was present for most of the parameters observed (p < 0. 05). The interaction effect between medio-lateral and antero-posterior traditional parameters differed in linearity between stances. The results confirm the effect of vision removal on the body sway. However, for the medio-lateral traditional parameters, the effects did not increase linearly with the change in width and stance type. This suggests that removal of vision could be more effectively compensated by other sensory systems in semi-tandem stance, tandem and single legged stanc...|$|R

Therefore, physiological responses of emotions have been receiving a significant attention. However, {{the assumption of}} nonlinear characteristics of physiological signals is usually disregarded. Basic methods: In the current study, a novel approach for classification of emotional states is presented using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and nonlinear methodology. Applying 3 channels of EEG from eNTERFACE 06 _EMOBRAIN database, some measures of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) (including: recurrence rate, deterministic, average line length of diagonal lines, <b>entropy,</b> laminarity, and <b>trapping</b> time) are calculated in 3 emotional states (exciting negative, neutral and exciting positive).

40|$|We explore {{various aspects}} of {{dynamical}} black holes defined by a future outer trapping horizon in n(> 5) -dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. In the present paper, {{we assume that the}} spacetime has symmetries corresponding to the isometries of an (n- 2) -dimensional maximally symmetric space and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant is non-negative. Depending on the existence or absence of the general relativistic limit, solutions are classified into GR and non-GR branches, respectively. Assuming the null energy condition on matter fields, we show that a future outer trapping horizon in the GR branch possesses the same properties as that in general relativity. In contrast, that in the non-GR branch is shown to be non-spacelike with its area non-increasing into the future. We can recognize this peculiar behavior to arise from a fact that the null energy condition necessarily leads to the null convergence condition for radial null vectors in the GR branch, but not in the non-GR branch. The energy balance law yields the first law of a trapping horizon, from which we can read off the <b>entropy</b> of a <b>trapping</b> horizon reproducing Iyer-Wald's expression. The entropy of a future outer trapping horizon is shown to be non-decreasing in both branches along its generator.

40|$|Neutron {{stars are}} very dense objects. One {{teaspoon}} of their material {{would have a}} mass of five billion tons. Their gravitational force {{is so strong that}} if an object were to fall from just one meter high it would hit the surface of the respective neutron star at two thousand kilometers per second. In such dense bodies, different particles from the ones present in atomic nuclei, the nucleons, can exist. These particles can be hyperons, that contain non-zero strangeness, or broader resonances. There can also be different states of matter inside neutron stars, such as meson condensates and if the density is height enough to deconfine the nucleons, quark matter. As new degrees of freedom appear in the system, different aspects of matter have {{to be taken into account}}. The most important of them being the restoration of the chiral symmetry. This symmetry is spontaneously broken, which is a fact related to the presence of a condensate of scalar quark-antiquark pairs, that for this reason is called chiral condensate. This condensate is present at low densities and even in vacuum. It is important to remember at this point that the modern concept of vacuum is far away from emptiness. It is full of virtual particles that are constantly created and annihilated, being their existence allowed by the uncertainty principle. At very high temperature/density, when the composite particles are dissolved into constituents, the chiral consensate vanishes and the chiral symmetry is restored. To explain how and when chiral symmetry is restored in neutron stars we use a model called non-linear sigma model. This is an effective quantum relativistic model that was developed in order to describe systems of hadrons interacting via meson exchange. The model was constructed from symmetry relations, which allow it to be chiral invariant. The first consequence of this invariance is that there are no bare mass terms in the lagrangian density, causing all, or most of the particles masses to come from the interactions with the medium. There are still other interesting features in neutron stars that cannot be found anywhere else in nature. One of them is the high isospin asymmetry. In a normal nucleus, the amount of protons and neutrons is more or less the same. In a neutron star the amount of neutrons is much higher than the protons. The resulting extra energy (called Fermi energy) increases the energy of the system, allowing the star to support more mass against gravitational collapse. As a consequence of that in early stages of the neutron star evolution, when there are still many trapped neutrinos, the proton fraction is higher than in later stages and consequently the maximum mass that the star can support against gravity is smaller. This, between many other features, shows how the microscopic phenomena of the star can reflect into the macroscopic properties. Another important property of neutron stars is charge neutrality. It is a required assumption for stability in neutron stars, but there are others. One example is chemical equilibrium. It means that the number of particles from each kind is not conserved, but they are created and annihilated through specific reactions that happen at the same rate in both directions. Although to calculate microscopic physics of neutron stars the space-time of special relativity, the Minkowski space, can be used, this is not true for the global properties of the star. In this case general relativity has to be used. The solution of Einstein's equations simplified to static, spherical and isotropic stars correspond to the configurations in which the star is in hydrostatic equilibrium. That means that the internal pressure, coming mainly from the Fermi energy of the neutrons, balances the gravity avoiding the collapse. When rotation is included the star becomes more stable, and consequently, can be more massive. The movement also makes it non-spherical, what requires the metric of the star to also be a function of the polar coordinate. Another important feature that has to be taken into account is the dragging of the local inertial frame. It generates centrifugal forces that are not originated in interactions with other bodies, but from the non-rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made. These modifications are introduced through the Hartle's approximation that solves the problem by applying perturbation theory. In the mean field approximation, the couplings as well as the parameters of the non-linear sigma model are calibrated to reproduce massive neutron stars. The introduction of new degrees of freedom decreases the maximum mass allowed for the neutron star, as they soften the equation of state. In practice, the only baryons present in the star besides the nucleons are the Lambda and Sigma-, in the case in which the baryon octet is included, and Lambda and Delta-, 0,+,++, in the case in which the baryon decuplet is included. The leptons are included to ensure charge neutrality. We choose to proceed our calculations including the baryon octet but not the decuplet, in order to avoid uncertainties in the couplings. The couplings of the hyperons were fitted to the depth of their potentials in nuclei. In this case the chiral symmetry restoration can be observed through the behavior of the related order parameter. The symmetry begins to be restored inside neutron stars and the transition is a smooth crossover. Different stages of the neutron star cooling are reproduced taking into account trapped neutrinos, finite temperature and entropy. Finite-temperature calculations include the heat bath of hadronic quasiparticles within the grand canonical potential of the system. Different schemes are considered, with constant temperature, metric dependent temperature and constant entropy. The neutrino chemical potential is introduced by fixing the lepton number in the system, that also controls the amount of electrons and protons (for charge neutrality). The balance between these two features is delicate and influenced mainly by the baryon number conservation. Isolated stars have a fixed number of baryons, which creates a link between different stages of the cooling. The maximum masses allowed in each stage of the cooling process, the one with high <b>entropy</b> and <b>trapped</b> neutrinos, the deleptonized one with high entropy, and the cold one in beta equilibrium. The cooling process is also influenced by constraints related to the rotation of the star. When rotation is included the star becomes more stable, and consequently, can be more massive. The movement also deforms it, requiring the metric of the star to include modifications that are introduced through the use of perturbation theory. The analysis of the first stages of the neutron star, when it is called proto-neutron star, gives certain constraints on the possible rotation frequencies in the colder stages. Instability windows are calculated in which the star can be stable during certain stages but collapses into black holes during the cooling process. In the last part of the work the hadronic SU(3) model is extended to include quark degrees of freedom. A new effective potential to the order parameter for deconfinement, the Polyakov loop, makes the connection between the physics at low chemical potential and hight temperature of the QCD phase diagram with the height chemical potential and low temperature part. This is done through the introduction of a chemical potential dependency on the already temperature dependent potential. Analyzing the effect of both order parameters, the chiral condensate and the Polyakov loop, we can drawn a phase diagram for symmetric as well as for star matter. The diagram contains a crossover region as well as a first order phase transition line. The new couplings and parameters of the model are chosen mainly to fit lattice QCD, including the position of the critical point. Finally, this matter containing different degrees of freedom (depending on which phase of the diagram we are) is used to calculate hybrid star properties. Neutronensterne sind Objekte sehr hoher Dichte [...] ein Teeloeffel Ihrer Bestandteile haette ein Gewicht von ca. fuenf Milliarden Tonnen. Die Gravitationskraft auf ihrer Oberflaeche ist so stark, dass diese ein fallendes Objekt innerhalb eines Meters auf eine Geschwindigkeit von zweitausend Kilometer pro Sekunde beschleunigen wuerde. In Objekten solcher hoher Dichte koennen Teilchen existieren, die sich von den Nukleonen in Atomkernen unterscheiden. Solche Teilchen koennen Hyperonen mit nichtverschwindender Strangeness sein, oder auch breitere Resonanzen.

Mit dem Auftreten neuer Freiheitsgrade des Systems maessen verschiedene Eigenschaften der Materie beruecksichtigt werden. Der in diesem Zusammenhang wichtigste Aspekt ist die Wiederherstellung der chiralen Symmetrie.
