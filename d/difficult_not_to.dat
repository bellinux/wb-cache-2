5|$|Einstein's 1905 {{predictions}} were verified experimentally {{in several}} ways {{in the first two}} decades of the 20th century, as recounted in Robert Millikan's Nobel lecture. However, before Compton's experiment showed that photons carried momentum proportional to their wave number (1922), most physicists were reluctant to believe that electromagnetic radiation itself might be particulate. (See, for example, the Nobel lectures of Wien, Planck and Millikan.) Instead, there was a widespread belief that energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbed or emitted radiation. Attitudes changed over time. In part, the change can be traced to experiments such as Compton scattering, where it was much more <b>difficult</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> ascribe quantization to light itself to explain the observed results.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>difficult</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{come to the}} {{conclusion}} that the rabid hatred of England which animates the exiled Irishmen who direct almost all the Northern newspapers, will so excite the masses as to make it impossible for Lincoln and Seward to grant our demands; and we must therefore look forward to war as the probable result.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{differences}} in opinion on {{who should be}} given the credit for designing Rocket. George Stephenson had designed several locomotives before but none as advanced as Rocket. At the time that Rocket was being designed and built at the Forth Banks Works, he was living in Liverpool overseeing the building of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. His son Robert had recently returned from a stint working in South America and resumed as managing director of Robert Stephenson and Company. He was in daily charge of designing and constructing the new locomotive. Although he was in frequent contact with his father in Liverpool and probably received advice from him, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> give the majority of the credit for the design to Robert. A third person who may deserve a significant amount of credit is Henry Booth, the treasurer of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. He is believed to have suggested to Robert Stephenson that a multi-tube boiler should be used.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Gandhi's {{choice of}} the salt tax was met with incredulity by the Working Committee of the Congress, Jawaharlal Nehru and Dibyalochan Sahoo were ambivalent; Sardar Patel {{suggested}} a land revenue boycott instead.

500|$|The {{show was}} {{directed}} and edited (along with Pile) by Tristram Shapeero and Dominic Brigstocke. Sketches were sped up or slowed down to create comic effect, often using body language to create humour. Editing {{was also used}} due {{to the amount of}} corpsing that occurred during the filming of the show. Tamsin Greig was said to corpse frequently, and episodes were written to minimise the contact between the characters of Caroline Todd and Alan Statham because Greig found it <b>difficult</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> laugh when acting alongside Mark Heap. The music, which plays prominently in the show, was written by Jonathan Whitehead (under the name [...] "Trellis") and won him an RTS Craft & Design Award.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} film critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 84% [...] "fresh" [...] {{with an average}} rating of 7.1/10 based on 138 reviews. Its critical consensus states, [...] "Although predictable in every way, a winning performance from its young star Keke Palmer {{and the rest of}} the cast makes it <b>difficult</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> cheer for the little heroine of Akeelah and the Bee. Sort of like Rocky for the middle school nerd set, Akeelah [...] is a warm, family-friendly underdog story, featuring terrific supporting performances from Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett." [...] On Metacritic, the film achieved an average score of 72 out 100, based on 30 reviews, signifying [...] "generally favorable reviews". CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare average grade of A+.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{critical}} reception {{has been}} mixed, with critics praising the film's atmosphere while deprecating the acting. Time Out London wrote, [...] "Halperin shoots this poetic melodrama as trance... The unique result constitutes a virtual bridge between classic Universal horror and the later Val Lewton productions." [...] TV Guide gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, comparing the film's atmosphere to Carl Dreyer's film Vampyr. However, the magazine described the acting as [...] "woefully inadequate", {{with the exception}} of Lugosi. Edward G. Bansk, a Val Lewton biographer, identified several flaws in White Zombie, including poor acting, bad timing and other [...] "haphazard and sloppy" [...] film aspects. Bansk wrote, [...] "Although White Zombie is a film with courage, a film <b>difficult</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> admire, its ambitions overstep competence of its principal players." ...|$|E
500|$|However, GameBrink.Com {{felt that}} the gameplay, {{user-friendly}} even to non-Japanese players, consists of too much repetitive button mashing despite featuring characters with different abilities. The Code Extension mode was considered imperfectly implemented, seeming {{as if it were}} [...] "tacked on [...] late in development", being totally optional yet <b>difficult</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> use to survive in the later missions. Calling the gameplay [...] "shallow", the site stated that [...] "the soundtrack would probably be a better purchase than the actual game". On its part, Siliconera noted that while the gameplay may seem complex for using every button on the controller, thirty minutes were enough to grasp how to play the game. The site felt the missions were designed with good pacing and replayability value, but added that hardcore role-playing game fans could dislike the lack of exploration, puzzle, and standard role-playing game principles.|$|E

She writes, [...] "if they can manage to work Pearl into the plot somewhere, I'll take back everything I've already said about this film. Maybe she could get beached on the shore, I don't know. Pearl's the best." [...] Joseph Foy, author of the novel SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy, felt that it was <b>difficult</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> sympathize with Pearl's situation since she believes she is [...] "more important to her father than money," [...] but [...] "we, the viewing audience, know differently". DVD Talks Paul Mavis wrote in his review of Legends of Bikini Bottom that he found Pearl [...] "annoyingly funny". In 2013, [...] of El Mundo said that he felt Pearl brings an easily recognizable youthful tone to the show.|$|E
500|$|Sharma {{was raised}} in Bangalore. She was educated at the Army School there, and {{received}} a degree in arts from Mount Carmel College. She originally intended {{to pursue a career}} in modelling or journalism, and had no aspirations to be an actress. After graduation, Sharma moved to Mumbai to further her modelling career. She enrolled herself at the Elite Model Management, and was groomed by the style consultant Prasad Bidapa. In 2007, Sharma made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Wendell Rodricks's Les Vamps Show and was picked to be his finale model at the Spring Summer 2007 Collection. Since then she has done campaigns for the brands Silk & Shine, Whisper, Nathella Jewelry and Fiat Palio. Sharma later said, [...] "I think I was born to emote and act. I would walk down the ramp and smile and they used to say, ‘give us a blank look.’ It was really <b>difficult,</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> smile". Whilst modelling, Sharma also joined an acting school and began auditioning for film roles. Her first role was of an extra in the comedy drama Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006).|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Allistair Pinsof at Destructoid {{reviewed}} the game, {{calling it a}} mix between Paperboy and Muscle March {{in terms of the}} complexity and pace, and compared the gameplay to Crash Bandicoot. He found it to be [...] "such a gloriously twisted, charming spectacle" [...] that it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> like it; he said that the main reason to play the game is [...] "the sheer lunacy" [...] of it, saying that the game is [...] "obsessed" [...] with America, and portrays Americans as [...] "unhygienic hillbillies" [...] in a manner that makes it unclear if it is a self-aware parody or not. He concluded that the game is funny, but not great, and that the ridiculous premise and its large amount of small details make the game [...] "charmingly brain-dead". In 2013, Justin Amirkhani at Complex included the game in a list of company-branded video games that [...] "didn't suck", saying that while the game's graphics had not aged well, it was mechanically very similar to Temple Run, which Amirkhani called his favorite iOS game. He concluded that Pepsiman is not a bad game for people with quick reflexes, {{as long as they can}} stand the high amount of advertising within the game; he claimed that Pepsiman was the advergame with the largest amount of [...] "logos-per-second".|$|E

500|$|While on {{a school}} field trip to a candy factory, Butters spots actor Tom Cruise working there, packing fudge into boxes. Stan, who {{previously}} told Cruise that his acting {{is not as good}} as others' in [...] "Trapped in the Closet", accidentally insults him again by calling him a [...] "", as Cruise claims to be fly fishing. Cruise then recruits 200 other celebrities who have been ridiculed by the town of South Park to bring a class action lawsuit against the town. Stan returns to the factory with his father Randy to try to apologize and convince Cruise to drop the suit, but also finds it <b>difficult</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> call him a fudge packer as well since he was literally packing fudge while they spoke. An angry Cruise agrees to do so, but only if they can help Cruise meet Muhammad. This causes an uproar because depictions of Muhammad are forbidden, and the townsfolk fear that forcing Muhammad to appear in public will drive Muslim radicals to bomb the town. Stan and Kyle go to the Super Best Friends, a squad of superhero-like religious figures (Jesus Christ, Gautama Buddha, Moses, Krishna, Laozi, Joseph Smith) of which Muhammad is a member, to request he return with them to South Park. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Cruise and the other celebrities only want Muhammad for his [...] "goo", as Rob Reiner, previously shown to be filled with [...] "goo" [...] in [...] "Butt Out", has invented a machine to transfer Muhammad's [...] "goo" [...] to the celebrities, which they believe will make them immune to ridicule, just like Muhammad.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Raynor was generally well received by critics and fans alike. Gaming's Edge described Raynor as an [...] "almost prototypical action movie figure" [...] with a [...] "healthy dose of arrogance" [...] who despite always {{attempting to do}} the morally right thing invariably ends up with [...] "the worst end of the deal" [...] due to circumstances beyond his control. The article also puts forward the case that [...] "it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> admire Raynor, {{if for no other}} reason than his persistence" [...] in the face of abandonment, isolation and betrayal. In the review of StarCraft for the magazine GamePro, the reviewer stated that he felt that the portrayal of characters was so good that he felt they [...] "were actually talking to me" [...] and expressed that he began to feel an emotional attachment to the plights of Raynor, commenting [...] "When was the last time you could say that about a character in a strategy game?" [...] A reader's poll for GameSpot voted Raynor one of video gaming's top ten heroes, complimenting Raynor's character on his humanity, his resilience in the face of consistent loss, as well as his progression from backwater marshal to galactic hero. GameSpot also gave additional praise to the quality of Robert Clotworthy's voice acting. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 80th [...] "most memorable, influential, and badass" [...] protagonist in games, commenting: [...] "He embodies the concept of the greater good and is willing to put it all on the line to protect others. If you’re ever stuck in a sticky situation, whether it’s against a swarm of Zerg or a Protoss fleet, he’s the man you want to be fighting side by side with." [...] In 2013, Complex ranked Raynor as the 24th greatest soldier in video games.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{thought that}} [...] "Thunder" [...] and [...] "Fire Under My Feet" [...] {{were some of}} Lewis's [...] "strongest compositions" [...] to date, and added that they are [...] "sharply crafted and passionate". Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner thought that while Lewis {{does not appear to}} have reinvented her sound, her new sense of passion [...] "leads the tried and tested formula with a hefty charge". He listed [...] "Thunder" [...] in his top four tracks to {{download}} from I Am, along with [...] "Another Love Song, [...] "Power" [...] and [...] "I Got You". Both Kathy Iandoli and Robbie Daw of Idolator praised [...] "Thunder": the former described the track as [...] "equally anthemic" [...] as [...] "Fire Under My Feet" [...] while the latter wrote that it is a [...] "soulful, soaring ballad" [...] which, as with many of Lewis' songs, is <b>difficult</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get immersed in with its strong emotional sentiment. Knoxville News Sentinel writer Chuck Campbell highlighted it as one of the albums many great tracks, writing [...] "Lewis lassoes the rumbling beat of opener 'Thunder' to announce her return – and she’s off from there." [...] Next Magazine writer Benjamin Lindsay picked [...] "Thunder" [...] as a [...] "standout" [...] song on I Am, along with [...] "Fire Under My Feet", [...] "The Essence of Me" [...] and [...] "You Knew Me When". In the United States, [...] "Thunder" [...] peaked at number 29 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart for one week.
