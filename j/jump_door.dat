50|$|The {{location}} of the wreckage was first discovered by U.S. Air Force search and rescue on 7 February 1973. The plane was determined to have crashed inverted, coming to rest upside down in the jungle; both wings had been sheered off. A team consisting of three pararescuemen and an intelligence expert {{were on the ground}} for approximately an hour and found three bodies in the charred wreckage, those of Spitz, Prim and Bollinger in the cockpit, still strapped in their seats. Outside of the wreckage, they found Lt. Bernhardt's body. In the rear of the plane they observed that the <b>jump</b> <b>door</b> had been removed (it was never located), the crew's safety belts were unbuckled, and all of the top secret sensitive equipment was missing as were the rear crew's parachutes.|$|E

50|$|Air filming {{was done}} in the first weeks of September 1976, {{culminating}} in a series of air drops of a total of 1,000 men, together with the dropping of supplies from a number of Dakota aircraft. The Dakotas were gathered by the film company Joseph E. Levine Presents Incorporated. All aircraft were required to be CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) or FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) registered and licensed to carry passengers. An original deal for the purchase of ten fell through when two airframes were rejected as passenger configured without the necessary <b>jump</b> <b>doors.</b> Eleven Dakotas were procured. Two ex-Portuguese Air Force, 6153 and 6171 (N9984Q and N9983Q), and two from Air International, operating from Djibouti in French Somaliland, F-OCKU and F-OCKX (N9985Q and N9986Q) were purchased by Joseph E. Levine. Three Danish Air Force K-685, K-687, and K-688, and four Finnish Air Force C-47s, DO-4, DO-7, DO-10 and DO-12, were loaned {{for the duration of the}} parachute filming.|$|R

25|$|Airspeed {{assembled}} a design team, headed by aircraft designer Hessell Tiltman. Tiltman's design efforts were initially {{carried out at}} the de Havilland technical school at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, before relocating to Salisbury Hall, London Colney. Initially, it was planned that the Horsa would {{have been used to}} transport paratroopers, who would <b>jump</b> from <b>doors</b> installed {{on either side of the}} fuselage, while remaining under tow throughout; under this concept, the use of the type for actual landings would considered to have been a secondary role. The widely set doors enabled simultaneous egress to be conducted, as well for troops on board to fire upon nearby hostiles from within the glider; for the latter purpose, they were also provisioned with several purpose-built firing points located in the roof and tail. However, the idea was soon dropped, and it was decided to simply have the glider land airborne troops.|$|R

50|$|Bo was an ex-stock car driver (though {{he joined}} the Nascar Circuit for most of season 5 with his cousin Luke), and he was {{typically}} the one known for taking the General off most of its legendary <b>jumps.</b> Because its <b>doors</b> were welded shut, Bo and Luke always had to climb {{in and out of}} the car through the windows. Actors John Schneider and Tom Wopat have admitted that, on occasions that the roles were reversed and Luke drove, they found it much more difficult to climb {{in and out of the}} opposite window to which they were accustomed.|$|R
50|$|The player {{uses the}} {{joystick}} {{to move and}} perform various attacks against ninjas and projectiles. Each time the character is hit they will lose some of their health, but they will also lose some health for every kick or punch they perform.

60|$|I {{have never}} kept a diary, and I have found it, in consequence, {{somewhat}} difficult, in telling this narrative, {{to arrange the}} minor incidents of my story in their proper sequence. I am writing {{by the light of}} an imperfect memory; and the work is {{complicated by the fact that}} the early days of my sojourn at Sanstead House are a blur, a confused welter like a Futurist picture, from which emerge haphazard the figures of boys--boys working, boys eating, boys playing football, boys whispering, shouting, asking questions, banging <b>doors,</b> <b>jumping</b> on beds, and clattering upstairs and along passages, the whole picture faintly scented with a composite aroma consisting of roast beef, ink, chalk, and that curious classroom smell which is like nothing else on earth.|$|R
60|$|As {{the night}} wore on, and they {{proceeded}} by ways which were quite unknown to them--for they could recognise {{none of the}} objects of which they sometimes caught a hurried glimpse--their fears increased; nor were they without good foundation; it was not difficult for two beautiful young women to find, in their being borne they knew not whither by a band of daring villains who eyed them as some among these fellows did, reasons for the worst alarm. When they at last entered London, by a suburb {{with which they were}} wholly unacquainted, it was past midnight, and the streets were dark and empty. Nor was this the worst, for the carriage stopping in a lonely spot, Hugh suddenly opened the <b>door,</b> <b>jumped</b> in, and took his seat between them.|$|R

Finn and Jake chase through the creature's various doors, stumbling upon Princess Bubblegum and Marceline, who both appear to be victims of the Door Lord's theft. Finally, the <b>Door</b> Lord <b>jumps</b> through a <b>door</b> that the group is unable to get past.

50|$|A major design problem {{involves}} {{the fact that}} the microprocessor (which is inside the top of each cartridge) lacks ESD protection and is directly connected to the copper pins which normally connect the cartridge to the Microvision unit. If the user opens the protective sliding door that covers the pins, the processor can be exposed to any electric charge the user has built up. If the user has built up a substantial charge, the discharge can <b>jump</b> around the <b>door's</b> edge or pass through the door itself (dielectric breakdown). The low-voltage integrated circuit inside the cartridge is extremely ESD sensitive, and can be destroyed by an event of only a few dozen volts which cannot even be felt by the person, delivering a fatal shock to the game unit. This phenomenon was described in detail by John Elder Robison (a former Milton Bradley engineer) in his book Look Me in the Eye.|$|R

Overconfident, Mo engages the robot in battle, and it injects him with the same toxin that killed Alvy. Mo {{experiences}} euphoria {{and a series of}} hallucinations as he dies. After Jill reenters her apartment, the M.A.R.K. 13 sets her apartment doors to rapidly open and close; the security team die when they attempt to enter, and Shades is trapped outside.

50|$|Game Attributes: He is {{the biggest}} {{member of the group}} and his {{tremendous}} strength allows him to fight, knock out and tie the enemies very quickly. He is able to knock down virtually every <b>door,</b> <b>jump</b> from incredible heights, climb poles and swing along wires. In terrains such as sand or snow, the Green Beret can camouflage himself, using a small shovel, making him invisible to the enemy. He is also the second fastest runner of the group of commandos and his amazing stamina allows him to withstand flesh wounds and gunshots that would kill any other. His preferred lethal weapons are his knife, his bare hands and stealth and with these at hand, the Green Beret is a killing machine. The Green Beret is also equipped with a radio device called a decoy. He can place it near the enemy and can remotely activate the device, causing brief distraction and temporarily interrupting guard positions and patrol routes. This is one of many ways to lure an enemy into a trap.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the night}} of 26 April, General Kreipe left {{headquarters}} in Archanes. The car headed without escort to a well-guarded residence, [...] "Villa Ariadni", about 25 km outside Heraklion. Major Fermor and Captain Moss, dressed as German military policemen, waited for him 1 km before his residence. When he arrived, they asked the driver to stop and asked for their papers. As soon as the car stopped, Fermor opened Kreipe's <b>door,</b> <b>jumped</b> in, and threatened him with his pistol, while Moss took the driver's seat. (The abduction is now commemorated near Archanes.) Moss drove the kidnappers and the General {{for an hour and}} a half through 22 controlled road blocks in Heraklion, before leaving Leigh Fermor to drive on and abandon the car, with material being planted that suggested their escape from the island had been made by submarine. Moss set off with the General on a cross-country march supported by the Greek resistance, soon rejoined by Leigh Fermor. Hunted by German patrols, the kidnappers crossed the mountains to reach the southern side of the island, where a British Motor Launch (ML 842 commanded by Brian Coleman) was waiting to rendez-vous. Eventually, on 14 May 1944, they were picked up from Peristeres beach near Rhodakino and ferried to Egypt.|$|R

5000|$|Inside the pylon, Holly {{stands at}} the matrix table while a column of lights descends and {{surrounds}} her. When the lights ascend again, the door opens revealing that Holly is apparently {{no longer in the}} Land of the Lost, but rather in a cold, snowy, mountainous environment. She goes back to the matrix table and lights descend again. This time, the door opens to {{what appears to be a}} pristine Lost City from a much earlier time as there is no trace of any jungle or Big Alice. She calls out to an Altrusian resembling Enik who hears her and starts to walk towards her but the door closes again and the column returns. Next, it opens on a noisy, alien jungle with a purple tint to the foliage. A small, animate object resembling a box on springs jumps into the pylon before the door closes and rests on the matrix table. The column reappears over both of them and when the door opens once more, Holly believes she is back in the Land of the Lost. The box <b>jumps</b> out the <b>door</b> but, before Holly can leave, it explodes. Holly then notices that the words [...] "HOLLY DON'T" [...] are written in the dirt just outside the pylon. She takes this as a message from her father and brother not to leave the pylon. The next journey takes Holly to a red-tinted desert with a huge vacuum cleaner-like object that is consuming objects. As it turns to the pylon, Holly steps back frightened and anxiously waits for the door to close. When it reopens, Holly finds that she is in a park on modern-day Earth and watches as kids play with a frisbee. One of them throws the frisbee towards the doorway and Holly catches it before the door closes again.|$|R
60|$|There was a doubter in Donegal, and {{he would}} not hear of ghosts or sheogues, and there was a house in Donegal that had been haunted as long as man could remember, and {{this is the story of}} how the house got the better of the man. The man came into the house and lighted a fire in the room under the haunted one, and took off his boots and set them On the hearth, and {{stretched}} out his feet and warmed him self. For a time he prospered in his unbelief; but a little while after the night had fallen, and everything had got very dark, one of his boots began to move. It got up off the floor and gave a kind of slow <b>jump</b> towards the <b>door,</b> and then the other boot did the same, and after that the first boot jumped again. And thereupon it struck the man that an invisible being had got into his boots, and was now going away in them. When the boots reached the door they went up-stairs slowly, and then the man heard them go tramp, tramp round the haunted room over his head. A few minutes passed, and he could hear them again upon the stairs, and after that in the passage outside, and then one of them came in at the door, and the other gave a jump past it and came in too. They jumped along towards him, and then one got up and hit him, and afterwards the other hit him, and then again the first hit him, and so on, until they drove him out of the room, and finally out of the house. In this way he was kicked out by his own boots, and Donegal was avenged upon its doubter. It is not recorded whether the invisible being was a ghost or one of the Sidhe, but the fantastic nature of the vengeance is like the work of the Sidhe who live in the heart of fantasy.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the fall}} of Vicksburg, the Union Navy {{was in charge of}} the Mississippi River. The gunboat Rattler was {{stationed}} in front of Rodney to ensure the federal control of this important town, and aware that the area was not completely secure, the admiral left strict orders that no sailor was to leave the ship. But on Sunday September 12, 1863, 22 sailors, contrary to these orders, a lieutenant, and a captain left the ship dressed in their best uniforms, and quietly seated themselves amongst the Presbyterian Church congregation. As the second hymn was being sung, a Lt. Allen of the Confederate Cavalry walked up the aisle to the pulpit. Apologizing to the Reverend Baker, he turned and announced that his men had surrounded the building and demanded the Yankee sailors surrender. One of the Yankee sailors <b>jumped</b> behind a <b>door</b> and took a shot at Lt. Allen. A general melee broke out, and most of the citizens dove under their pews for safety and reputedly one Yankee sailor hid in the undergarments of his local southern girlfriend. One older lady, however, would not run. She stood up in her pew and shouted [...] "Glory to God!" [...] A skeleton crew had remained on board the Rattler, and, when they heard the commotion, began firing their guns at the church. The church and four homes were hit. The firing ceased once word was sent that the Confederates threatened to execute the prisoners. It was on this day that a cannonball lodged itself in the front wall of the Presbyterian Church. The Confederate Army had taken 17 prisoners, including the lieutenant and captain. The crew of the Rattler became the laughingstock of the nation, for it was the first time in history a small squad of cavalry captured the crew of an ironclad gunboat. (Local history tells us that the cannonball that is imbedded very high up in the front of the Church was placed there many years later. The original one had fallen out. Photos of the church in the 1930s one on this site show no cannonball in the front of the church) To eliminate all Confederate presence in Rodney, Union infantrymen landed in Rodney and plundered almost every house in town. Citizens of Rodney later formed Company D. 22nd Mississippi infantry to fight against the Union army.|$|R
6000|$|... "After a long time, {{we began}} to run more slowly. I put my head out and {{could see in the}} {{distance}} a ring of lights hanging in the blackness. I loosened the carriage door and waited for the train to run slower still; I didn't mean to go into Linz like a rat into a trap. At last I could wait no longer; I opened the <b>door,</b> <b>jumped</b> and fell into some bushes. I was not much hurt, but bruised, and the breath knocked out of me. As soon as I could, I crawled out. It was very dark. I felt heavy and sore, and for some time went stumbling in and out amongst trees. Presently I came to a clear space; on one side I could see the town's shape drawn in lighted lamps, and on the other a dark mass, which I think was forest; in the distance too was a thin chain of lights. I thought: 'They must be the lights of a bridge.' Just then the moon came out, and I could see the river shining below. It was cold and damp, and I walked quickly. At last I came out on a road, past houses and barking dogs, down to the river bank; there I sat against a shed and went to sleep. I woke very stiff. It was darker than before; the moon was gone. I could just see the river. I stumbled on, to get through the town before dawn. It was all black shapes-houses and sheds, and the smell of the river, the smell of rotting hay, apples, tar, mud, fish; and here and there on a wharf a lantern. I stumbled over casks and ropes and boxes; I saw I should never get clear--the dawn had begun already on the other side. Some men came from a house behind me. I bent, and crept behind some barrels. They passed along the wharf; they seemed to drop into the river. I heard one of them say: 'Passau before night.' I stood up and saw they had walked on board a steamer which was lying head up-stream, with some barges in tow. There was a plank laid to the steamer, and a lantern at the other end. I could hear the fellows moving below deck, getting up steam. I ran across the plank and crept {{to the end of the}} steamer. I meant to go with them to Passau! The rope which towed the barges was nearly taut; and I knew if I could get on to the barges I should be safe. I climbed down on this rope and crawled along. I was desperate, I knew they'd soon be coming up, and it was getting light. I thought I should fall into the water several times, but I got to the barge at last. It was laden with straw. There was nobody on board. I was hungry and thirsty--I looked for something to eat; there was nothing but the ashes of a fire and a man's coat. I crept into the straw. Soon a boat brought men, one for each barge, and there were sounds of steam. As soon as we began moving through the water, I fell asleep. When I woke we were creeping through a heavy mist. I made a little hole in the straw and saw the bargeman. He was sitting by a fire at the barge's edge, so that the sparks and smoke blew away over the water. He ate and drank with both hands, and funny enough he looked in the mist, like a big bird flapping its wings; there was a good smell of coffee, and I sneezed. How the fellow started! But presently he took a pitchfork and prodded the straw. Then I stood up. I couldn't help laughing, he was so surprised--a huge, dark man, with a great black beard. I pointed to the fire and said 'Give me some, brother!' He pulled me out of the straw; I was so stiff, I couldn't move. I sat by the fire, and ate black bread and turnips, and drank coffee; while he stood by, watching me and muttering. I couldn't understand him well--he spoke a dialect from Hungary. He asked me: How I got there--who I was--where I was from? I looked up in his face, and he looked down at me, sucking his pipe. He was a big man, he lived alone on the river, and I was tired of telling lies, so I told him the whole thing. When I had done he just grunted. I can see him now standing over me, with the mist hanging in his beard, and his great naked arms. He drew me some water, and I washed and showed him my wig and moustache, and threw them overboard. All that day we lay out on the barge in the mist, with our feet to the fire, smoking; now and then he would spit into the ashes and mutter into his beard. I shall never forget that day. The steamer was like a monster with fiery nostrils, and the other barges were dumb creatures with eyes, where the fires were; we couldn't see the bank, but now and then a bluff and high trees, or a castle, showed in the mist. If I had only had paint and canvas that day!" [...] He sighed.|$|R
