40|$|The polarimetric {{performance}} of a quad-mode antenna element, consisting {{of a pair of}} crossed dipoles and an integrated monopole fed by a quadraxial transmission line, is analysed. Results are compared to a conventional <b>dual-polarised</b> <b>antenna</b> consisting of two orthogonal dipoles. The presented study shows that the quad-mode antenna effectively doubles the polarimetric capabilities of a <b>dual-polarised</b> <b>antenna</b> over the hemispherical field of view...|$|E
40|$|For {{three-dimensional}} {{electromagnetic wave}} field synthesis, {{the orientation of}} <b>dual-polarised</b> <b>antenna</b> elements has influence on the size or volume of the usable “quiet zone” or ”sweet spot”. The customary choice of polarisation directions along phi and theta allows for the full angular range over which wave fields can be synthesised. But, we show that this choice effectively reduces the number of available active radiators in case a single polarised wave is to be synthesised, with direction of incidence near the phi-axis. One option to maintain synthesis quality is driving both types of polarised elements, meaning also adding channel emulators that are an appreciable cost factor. However, not all applications need fully 3 -D incident fields and some simple compromises for specific applications are proposed...|$|E
40|$|A {{unidirectional}} <b>dual-polarised</b> <b>antenna</b> is presented, {{by applying}} a cavity-backed annular slot and two mutually perpendicular microstrip feed lines. To improve the isolation between two ports of the designed antenna, {{a pair of}} conductor strips is introduced at {{the opposite side of}} the feed lines and a metal cylinder into the cavity centre. Aimed at 2. 4 GHz wireless local area network systems, a prototype antenna has been fabricated based on the FR 4 substrate. The measured results show that an isolation value of over 33 dB can be attained and the co-polarised level is 30 dB larger than the cross-polarised in the main radiation direction. In addition to compact structure, the operating band with about 5 dBi antenna gain indicates the proposed antenna is suitable for indoor multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) base station systems...|$|E
30|$|While the {{depolarisation}} of an {{electromagnetic wave}} transmitted over a wireless channel {{is a well-known}} phenomenon, the interest in describing it arose {{from the fact that}} orthogonal polarisations can be exploited as additional degrees of freedom in a channel, in order to improve communication quality by means of polarisation diversity [1], or to increase the available data rates by means of polarisation multiplexing [2]. Recently, <b>dual-polarised</b> <b>antennas</b> are being considered for using high data rates in multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems, when the channel matrix is rank-deficient due to the presence of strong LoS (line-of-sight) [3].|$|R
40|$|A novel slot-coupling feeding {{technique}} for <b>dual-polarised</b> patch <b>antennas</b> is presented. A square patch is fed through a square ring slot excited by two non-overlapping feed lines {{printed on the}} same side of a single-layer substrate. With respect to other slot-coupling feeding techniques for <b>dual-polarised</b> patch <b>antennas,</b> the configuration here proposed exhibits a simple structure and a valuable symmetry property with respect to the two feeding ports, while preserving a satisfactory isolation. To show the working principle and the radiation properties of the proposed slot-coupled patch, a sample antenna operating in the 3. 3 – 3. 8 GHz WiMAXTM frequency band has been designed, prototyped and characterised...|$|R
30|$|Very few {{publications}} {{are available}} on the depolarisation effect in the off-body channel [12 – 14]. In [12], the authors consider depolarisation due to antenna mismatch, but only basic body rotations are analysed. In [13], an evaluation is performed on the achievable improvement in system performance when <b>dual-polarised</b> <b>antennas</b> are employed at the on-body node, in order to exploit polarisation diversity. Through the analysis of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error ratio (BER), it is observed that joint polarisation and spatial diversity can greatly improve system performance. Antenna depolarisation due to the body’s presence is also considered, being observed that Rx field polarisation for linearly polarised Tx antenna becomes elliptical when the antenna is placed on the body. The authors further expand their work in [14], where polarisation and spatial diversity are additionally employed at the off-body side. Neither of the available studies provide an off-body channel model taking the depolarisation effect into account.|$|R
40|$|Passive {{intermodulation}} (PIM) {{measurements of}} antennas {{and the design}} of dual-polarised microstrip antenna elements are investigated in this thesis. The {{emphasis is on the}} development of a passive intermodulation source localisation method and on the studies of the PIM source behaviour under various impedance loading conditions. Passive intermodulation distortion can be harmful in wireless communication systems where the difference between the transmitted and the received power is large such as in GSM base stations. One of the most critical components is the antenna. As the antennas become more complex, the risk of getting excessive PIM distortion increases. Therefore, the antenna designer needs to have knowledge about the PIM phenomenon and proper tools to investigate various antenna structure configurations. The concept of PIM near-field measurement is introduced and the implementation of the equipment for the GSM  900 frequency band is presented. The performance of the scanner is analysed and demonstrated with measurements. The scanner is capable of locating PIM sources in antennas and other open structures down to − 110  dBm when the transmitted power is 43  dBm. The limiting factors of the scanner sensitivity are considered and several sensitivity measurements are performed. An analysis of the impedance loading effects on PIM measurements is carried out. The conducted measurements support the theory that the loading impedance effects can be several decibels, when the source or load return loss is less than 20  dB, which is the case with many filters and antennas used in base stations. <b>Dual-polarised</b> <b>antenna</b> elements are needed in various array antenna applications. Two compact antenna element designs with moderate bandwidth and dual polarisation are introduced in the 12  GHz frequency band. The elements use a dual-resonant structure in order to achieve an impedance bandwidth of 16  % (Lretn >  10  dB). The arrangement of the antenna feeds results in an isolation of 35  dB between the ports. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The handset {{product has}} been styled in {{successive}} {{years to reach}} more compact sizes and there has as a result been a reduction in volume available to house antennas; therefore size/performance trade-offs have had to become accommodated. Some of the issues antenna engineers are currently confronted with include; frequency shifting due to the antenna not being isolated from the handset, far field pattern deformation due to close proximity effects from the energy absorbing human tissues, distortion caused by noise from electronic components that share the handheld platform. What is required is antenna technology, which maintains a high enough performance despite the escalating restrictions imposed by {{the demands of the}} market. Research is performed on a twisted loop antenna topology that possesses an integral balun as part of its structure. Two rudimentary designs are utilised in the research, a simple bifilar structure that can be adapted for GSM, peN, Bluetooth and W-LAN applications, and a quadrifilar helix structure for use in GPS. Both structures are based on existing industrial dielectricloaded antenna structures but are modelled as novel air-loaded structures using a commercially available Method of Moments (MoM) electromagnetic simulator. In this fashion, the antennas could be generated quickly with low computational requirements. A parametric study is performed on the bifilar antenna structure to gain an enhanced understanding of the twisted loop topology. Once this understanding is achieved proposed modifications to the structure are implemented to improve the performance of the antenna. The main subject of improvement is the broadening of bandwidth as normally dielectric-loaded antennas have inherent narrow bandwidth. Any improvements made on the air-loaded structures could be tested on dielectric structures in future research. The most successful novel approach attempted to increase the bandwidth in the twisted loop structure was the insertion of parasitic helices to create a coupled multi-pole filter response.

We introduce a new measurement concept which combines RF switching and synthetic aperture techniques and allows full 3 -D characterisation of the channel. Additionally used <b>dual-polarised</b> patch <b>antennas</b> allow investigations both with vertical and horizontal polarisations. For estimation of the azimuth- and elevation angles of the incoming waves, we use high-resolution 2 -D Unitary ESPRIT algorithm. We describe measurements with about 50 different transmitter positions and two receiver array sites with different antenna heights. Our {{results show that the}} environment seen by the base station strongly defines the propagation mechanisms. We demonstrate street canyon dominated propagation also when receiver array is at the rooftop level. We also show that signal components propagated over the rooftop are often related to the reflections from the high-rising buildings in the surroundings...|$|R

40|$|A new textile {{wearable}} wireless node, {{for operation}} in the 2. 45 GHz industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band, is proposed. It consists of a <b>dual-polarised</b> textile patch <b>antenna</b> with integrated microcontroller, sensor, memory and transceiver with receive diversity. Integrated into a garment, the flexible unit may serve for fall detection, {{as well as for}} patient or rescue-worker monitoring. Fragile and lossy interconnections are eliminated.

The compact and flexible module combines sensing and wireless channel monitoring functionality with reliable and energy-efficient off-body wireless communication capability, by fully exploiting dual polarisation diversity. By integrating a battery, a fully autonomous and flexible system is obtained. This novel textile wireless node was validated, both in flat and bent state, in the anechoic chamber, assessing the characteristics of the integrated system in free-space conditions.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy”. The rapid growth in wireless data traffic {{in recent years has}} placed a great strain on the wireless spectrum and the capacity of current wireless networks. In addition, the makeup of the typical wireless propagation environment is rapidly changing as a greater percentage of data traffic moves indoors, where the coverage of radio signals is poor. This dual fronted assault on coverage and capacity has meant that the tradition cellular model is no longer sustainable, as the gains from constructing new macrocells falls short of the increasing cost. The key emerging concept that can solve the aforementioned challenges is smaller base stations such as micro-, pico- and femto-cells collectively known as small cells. However with this solution come new challenges: while small cells are efficient at improving the indoor coverage and capacity; they compound the lack of spectrum even more and cause high levels of interference. Current channel models are not suited to characterise this interference as the small cells propagation environment is vast different. The result is that overall efficiency of the networks suffers. This thesis presents an investigation into the characteristics of the wireless propagation channel in small cell environments, including measurement, analysis, modelling, validation and extraction of channel data. Two comprehensive data collection campaigns were carried out, one of them employed a RUSK channel sounder and featured <b>dual-polarised</b> MIMO <b>antennas.</b> From the first dataset an empirical path loss model, adapted to typical indoor and outdoor scenarios found in small cell environments, was constructed using regression analysis and was validated using the second dataset. The model shows good accuracy for small cell environments and can be implemented in system level simulations quickly without much requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} is to investigate the existing photovoltaic antenna integration techniques and develop a new solar antenna integration topology in order to address the drawbacks of these techniques. With the increasing demands for low-profile antennas and a growing move towards the microgeneration of electricity, primarily by photovoltaics, photovoltaic antennas are of increasing importance with a growing amount of research in this area being developed. At present {{there are a number of}} designs for photovoltaic antennas which could be divided into two distinct categories. The first type is the use of solar cells as an RF ground plane, whilst the second type involves the use of solar cells as an RF radiating element. Both techniques bring significant challenges if they are to be widely adopted. Considering the first technique, using a solar cell as an RF ground plane introduces an optical shading problem, which significantly reduces the solar efficiency of the solar antennas using this integration topology. To this end, meshing the RF radiating element is investigated in this thesis to achieve optical transparency at the expense of increasing the cost and complexity of the fabrication process of photovoltaic antennas. Conversely, using a solar cell as an RF radiating element limits the ability to modify the resonance response using traditional RF bandwidth enhancement techniques due to the fact that solar cells need to have a homogeneous structure to achieve optimum solar performance. In order to address these challenges, a third solar antenna integration topology is proposed in this thesis. This method is based upon the use of solar cells as an RF stacked parasitic patch element suspended above the conventional RF radiating element of the integrated antennas. This integration topology enables the integrated solar cells to achieve an optimum solar efficiency due to their suspended position eliminating the shading problem. It also enables the RF radiating element to be modified to excite multiple TMmn propagation modes to achieve enhanced resonance response for multiband and wideband applications. This new topology has been further developed and applied to design a <b>dual-polarised</b> photovoltaic <b>antenna</b> for polarisation diverse communication systems, which has been extended to produce a photovoltaic array antenna for beam steering applications. This thesis addresses a major knowledge gap in the field of photovoltaic antennas. As a result of this, greater understanding of the design procedures of photovoltaic antennas and associated trade-offs from such designs is developed. Using this knowledge, novel designs that overcome the associated problems of current photovoltaic antennas are presented...|$|R
