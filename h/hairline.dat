5|$|Gunn {{was unable}} to save the club from relegation to the First Division, but signed a two-year {{contract}} in July 1998. However, a <b>hairline</b> fracture to his leg, sustained during the 1998 close season, effectively ended his playing career. On his doctors' advice, Gunn formally retired in March 1999.|$|E
5|$|The woman's veil forms {{a diamond}} shape, {{balanced}} by the inverse flow of a light vest worn beneath her dress. She is shown at a slight angle, but her pose is centred by the interlocked broad lines of arms, décolletage and veil. The woman's head is delicately lit, leaving no strong tonal contrasts on her skin. She has a long, thin face, plucked eyebrows and eyelids, and a plucked <b>hairline</b> to create a fashionably high forehead. Her hair is tightly pinned back {{on the rim of}} the bonnet and rests above her ear. Her high headdress and severe <b>hairline</b> accentuate her elongated face, giving it a sculpted appearance.|$|E
5|$|File:Paolo Ucello 001.jpg|A Young Lady of Fashion is {{attributed}} to the Florentine painter and mathematician Paolo Uccello and dates early 1460s. The young lady has plucked her <b>hairline</b> to increase the expanse, and thus elegance, of her forehead, and a lock of hair falls at the back in a ponytail. A tight-fitting cap covers her ears, a fashion possibly due to the prevalent belief {{of the time that}} the Virgin Mary conceived through the ear.|$|E
40|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{based on}} plastid-encoded rbcL and mitochondrial cox 3 gene sequences, {{in combination with}} morphological observations, revealed {{the existence of the}} following four bistratose Padina species previously unreported from Australian coasts: Padina calcarea Ni-Ni-Win, S. G. A. Draisma, W. F. Prud’homme van Reine & H. Kawai, characterised by its bright yellow–orange inferior thallus surface and chalky white, heavily calcified superior surface, and the presence of <b>hairlines</b> only on the inferior surface; P. macrophylla Ni-Ni-Win, M. Uchimura & H. Kawai, characterised by a moderately calcified thallus with broad, depressed <b>hairlines</b> on the inferior surface and narrow, not depressed <b>hairlines</b> on the superior surface, those <b>hairlines</b> that are largely spaced on each surface; P. moffittiana I. A. Abbott & Huisman, characterised by lightly calcified thalli with narrow, slightly depressed <b>hairlines</b> that are distributed in alternate sequence between the two surfaces at unequal distances, and broad reproductive sori in one or two rows in the fertile zone; and P. okinawaensis Ni-Ni-Win, S. Arai, M. Uchimura & H. Kawai, characterised by heavily calcified thalli, except at the <b>hairlines,</b> which form an alternation of uncalcified furrows and calcified glabrous zones on the inferior surface. With the addition of these four species, 13 Padina species are known from Australia. Ni-Ni-Win, Zhong-Min Sun, Takeaki Hanyuda, Akira Kurihara, Alan J. K. Millar, Carlos Frederico D.

5|$|Light {{falls on}} the {{pictorial}} space from the left, creating shadows against the back wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow {{on the wall behind}} the girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of her cheek and <b>hairline.</b>|$|E
5|$|Days {{after the}} first filling of the reservoir, around 80 <b>hairline</b> cracks were {{observed}} in the dam's structure. The submerged spillway gates of the dam might pose a risk of cavitation, similar to that which severely damaged the poorly designed and cavitating spillways of the Glen Canyon Dam in the US state of Arizona, which was unable to properly withstand the Colorado river floods of 1983. However 163,000 concrete units of the Three Gorges dam all passed quality testing and the deformation was within design limits. An experts group gave the project overall a good quality rating.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{days after}} his OHL return, Hodgson {{suffered}} another injury, breaking a toe on his right foot while blocking a shot against the Sudbury Wolves. Initial X-rays came up negative and he continued playing for nine more games before a second X-ray revealed a <b>hairline</b> fracture {{in one of his}} right metatarsal bones. Missing the Battalion's final five regular season games, he finished the campaign with eight goals and 20 points over 13 contests. Despite missing the majority of the season, he was voted as the smartest player in the Eastern Conference for the third consecutive year in the OHL coaches poll.|$|E

5|$|Smith lost Morrell and Trundle on free transfers, and {{replaced}} them with Chris Armstrong and Chris Llewellyn. The club's financial problems meant that players went unpaid at the start of 2003–04, although they remained in the play-off places in December 2003. However, a <b>hairline</b> fracture to Shaun Pejic left Smith short of defenders and the promotion challenge ebbed away to a mid-table finish. Wrexham retained the FAW Premier Cup though with a 4–1 victory over Rhyl. However, Smith made himself unpopular with supporters after refusing to endorse their campaign to oust controversial chairman Alex Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|The World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong further called {{attention}} to portrayals of Wang Jindong on state-run television, claiming {{that the man who}} self-immolated on the square was not the same person who appeared in subsequent interviews with CCTV. It pointed to a voice analysis conducted by the Speech Processing Laboratory at National Taiwan University, which concluded that the voices did not match, and also noted that the <b>hairline</b> and facial proportions appeared to be different. These observations were used to advance the theory that the self-immolators were actors.|$|E
5|$|For the 2008–09 season, the Rockets signed forward Ron Artest. While McGrady {{wound up}} playing {{only half the}} games before {{enduring}} a season-ending microfracture surgery, the Rockets ended the season 53–29, enough for the Western Conference's fifth seed. During the playoffs, the Rockets beat the Portland Trail Blazers four games to two, winning their first round since 1997. During the series, Dikembe Mutombo injured his knee, which forced him to retire after 18 seasons in the NBA. However, the second round against the Lakers had the Rockets losing 4-3 and Yao Ming suffering yet another season-ending injury, this time a <b>hairline</b> fracture in his left foot.|$|E

5000|$|Diagonal and {{vertical}} <b>hairlines</b> and serifs are relatively strong, while horizontal serifs {{are small and}} intend to emphasize stroke endings rather than stand out themselves. This principle is most noticeable in the italics where the lowercase characters are subdued in style. It is somewhat more condensed than average for a font of its kind. A profile of Bosma for the Monotype website commented: [...] "One of the defining features of the typeface is its contrast between heavy vertical serifs and <b>hairlines</b> - which keep the font sturdy, and ensures the design is preserved at small sizes - and its relatively thin horizontals, which ensure the typeface remains crisp when used at larger sizes." ...|$|R

5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding <b>hairline.</b> He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E
5|$|Speedie, by then 33 years old, {{joined the}} Roughriders despite {{the threat of}} legal action. Speedie had a league-leading seven touchdowns in 1953, and 576 {{receiving}} yards the following season. He {{was sent to the}} WIFU's BC Lions in 1955, but played only one game for the club. Speedie hurt his left knee and was declared out for the season. He had suffered a <b>hairline</b> leg fracture and underwent surgery on torn ligaments in his knee and ankle. He was expected to scout for the Lions as he recovered. After the injury, Speedie was cut from the Lions' roster and did not play professional football again.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} center was plagued {{from the start}} by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes {{to be used in}} the space frame came to the site with <b>hairline</b> cracks and other defects; 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises. The Javits Center opened on 3 April 1986, to a generally positive reception. During the inauguration ceremonies, however, neither Freed nor Pei was recognized for their role in the project.|$|E

5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as {{the length of a}} human face from the forehead's <b>hairline</b> to the tip of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|After making six {{successful}} {{defenses of}} the World Boxing Organization (WBO) light welterweight title, Cotto moved up in weight class to the welterweight division and defeated Carlos Quintana on December 2, 2006 {{to win the}} World Boxing Association (WBA) welterweight title. Cotto's first title defense came against mandatory challenger Oktay Urkal in a bout that took place on March 3, 2007, at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico. A mandatory challenger is a boxer who is chosen by a boxing organization {{to fight for their}} title. If the champion decides not to defend the title against the mandatory challenger, the boxing organization strips him of his title. In attendance for the bout was former undisputed welterweight champion Zab Judah, who was expected to be Cotto's next opponent as long as Cotto defeated Urkal and Judah won his fight in April. Cotto displayed a dominant performance against Urkal, eventually to the point where Urkal's corner retired in the eleventh round. On April 13, 2007, Judah's match with journeyman boxer Ruben Galvan ended in a no contest after a severe cut opened up around Galvan's <b>hairline,</b> which was ruled to have been caused by Judah's elbow. Despite the no contest, the bout between Cotto and Judah went ahead as planned, taking place at Madison Square Garden in New York City on June 9, 2007. In front of a sellout crowd of 20,658, Cotto defeated Judah by technical knockout in the eleventh round.|$|E
5|$|Charig et al. {{pointed to}} the {{presence}} of <b>hairline</b> cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner et al. then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account {{for the fact that the}} cracks were old and had been filled with calcite, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X-ray spectroscopy, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig et al. reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.|$|E

25|$|It was {{fashionable to}} pluck or shave the {{forehead}} {{to raise the}} <b>hairlines.</b> The hair was tied tightly on the scalp and usually hidden inside the cone (possibly {{one end of the}} veil was tied to the hair and wrapped round, with the free end being pulled through the hole {{at the tip of the}} cone). However some images show long hair worn loose behind the hennin.|$|R
2500|$|Out {{of their}} {{distinctive}} costumes, the brothers looked alike, even {{down to their}} receding <b>hairlines.</b> Zeppo could pass for a younger Groucho, and {{played the role of}} his son in Horse Feathers.

The three are indistinguishable, enabling them to carry off the [...] "mirror scene" [...] perfectly.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{representing}} a new vessel, the Enterprise-A {{was the same}} model {{that had been used}} since 1979. Poorly regarded by earlier effects artists because of its complicated wiring and bulk, the Enterprises <b>hairline</b> cracks were puttied and sanded down, and the internal circuitry was redone. The new model's running lights were matched to similar intensities, saving the effects artists time because the lights would look correct with only a single pass, instead of three passes required previously (for the sensor dome, running lights, and window lights). One unfortunate byproduct of the fixes was the loss of the model's distinctive pearlescent finish. The elaborate sheen was never visible on screen (lighting schemes prevented reflections while filming so the ship could be properly inserted into effects shots) and so when the model was repainted with conventional techniques the effect was lost. The Bird of Prey had been damaged from work in The Voyage Home, where the ship was supposed to fly around the sun. To suggest singes, the model had been painted with black-tinged rubber cement, with the expectation that this application would rub off. The cement instead sat on the model and baked itself to the model surface, and had to be scrubbed off.|$|E
5|$|Tolliver {{began his}} junior year facing Florida State, a game where he {{suffered}} a <b>hairline</b> fracture in his foot, leaving him doubtful for the match. He missed the first three {{games of the season}} but returned in Texas Tech's fourth game against Baylor, completing 14 of 25 passes for 189 yards, a touchdown and an interception in a 36–22 loss. Tolliver's next big performance came against TCU, the same team he defeated 63–7 as a freshman. He threw a touchdown pass to Wayne Walker in the last minute to beat TCU, 36–35. He finished the season having passed for 1,422 yards and seven touchdowns in eight games. The next season, his senior year, Tolliver and Texas Tech sought to win the Southwest Conference. He started the season strong, throwing an 85-yard pass against Arizona—it was the third-longest pass in school history—but the Red Raiders started with two losses. By the end of the season, Tolliver had set 16 school records and was awarded the Southwest Conference Sportsmanship Award by the league's officials. After four seasons with the Texas Tech Red Raiders, he set the school record for career passing yards (6,756), career pass attempts (1,008), career pass completions (493), career touchdown passes (38), season passing yards in 1988 (2,869), and single game passing yards (446) against Oklahoma State University in 1988. Tolliver was inducted into Texas Tech's Hall of Honor in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The Los Angeles Rams, who {{had been}} hobbled by {{injuries}} much of the season, entered the playoffs with the worst record (9–7) of the six division winners. Rams defensive end Jack Youngblood played {{the game with a}} <b>hairline</b> fracture of his left leg, and Vince Ferragamo continued to start in place of the injured Pat Haden. On {{the other side of the}} ball, the Buccaneers lost Lee Roy Selmon and Cecil Johnson with ankle injuries, Doug Williams with a torn bicep, and Wally Chambers with a knee injury. Mike Washington and Dave Lewis also missed part of the game with injuries. The game was the Rams' second consecutive playoff win against a team that had beaten them decisively during the regular season. Each team had a touchdown called back due to a penalty. The Rams also had a touchdown called back when it was ruled that receiver Preston Dennard did not maintain possession of the ball. The Rams offensive line was intact, unlike in the regular-season matchup. This provided for 216 yards rushing and gave Ferragamo much time to complete passes. Another change from the earlier game was that Wendell Tyler had become the starting halfback for the Rams. With Tyler's speed enabling the Rams to run outside, the Buccaneers were no longer able to clog the inside lanes with defenders and put the linebackers into coverage on passing downs. The Buc defense's focus on Tyler freed Cullen Bryant to run for 106 yards on 18 carries. Meanwhile, Buc quarterbacks Williams and Mike Rae were 4–26 on pass attempts. It took until the third quarter for the Buccaneers to even pass midfield, on a halfback option pass from Jerry Eckwood to Larry Mucker.|$|E
