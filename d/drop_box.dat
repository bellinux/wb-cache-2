5|$|On January 18, 1988, Vicki Myron, a {{librarian}} at the Spencer Public Library, discovered an eight-week-old male kitten {{that had been}} left in the library's <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> the previous night. Myron nursed the cat, who was suffering from frostbite, back to health and named him Dewey, after Melvil Dewey, inventor of the Dewey Decimal library classification system. The library decided to keep him as a library cat and his story first received publicity in the Spencer Daily Reporter a week after his discovery.|$|E
5|$|Dewey Readmore Books (November 18, 1987 – November 29, 2006) was {{the library}} cat of the Spencer, Iowa, Public Library. Having been {{abandoned}} in the library's <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> in January 1988, he {{was adopted by the}} library and gained local attention for his story shortly thereafter. His fame soon grew nationally, then internationally, and he was featured in a variety of mediums, including Paul Harvey's radio program The Rest of the Story and a Japanese documentary about cats. His story became so well known that, after his death in December 2006, his obituary was featured in more than 270 newspapers worldwide. Dewey's caretaker, head librarian Vicki Myron, published a book on Dewey's life in 2008, entitled , which became a New York Times number one nonfiction bestseller. It was translated into numerous languages. She adapted it for two children's versions. In addition, she wrote a sequel Dewey's Nine Lives (2010) and that year also published a third children's book, Dewey's Christmas at the Library.|$|E

25|$|Walter Whitehead {{was born}} on 12October 1840 at Haslam Hey, between Lowercroft and Walshaw in Bury, Lancashire. He was a son of John Whitehead and Eliza Ellen (née Allanson). According to some sources, his family had been textile {{bleacher}}s in the Lowercroft area for well over 200 years prior to his birth, while others say that his father came from Penwortham Priory, near Preston. His father was a bleacher and perhaps also a dyer and printer of textiles. Among his relations were the inventors John Kay (flying shuttle), Robert Kay (<b>drop</b> <b>box</b> for weaving looms) and Robert Whitehead (torpedo).|$|E
25|$|The {{hand loom}} with {{jacquard}} is a wooden hand loom {{typical of the}} many thousands of looms {{that were used in}} the domestic cottage industry throughout the British Isles. They were gradually replaced by all-metal looms (see the Hattersley domestic loom) and new methods of working practice, such as the factory system, during the Industrial Revolution. The loom has a four-shuttle <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> to weave up to four colours of weft, and has John Kay's flying shuttle method of inserting the weft. Most of the handlooms used in the home were ordinary shaft looms. These do not require roof space and would be weaving standard cloths, unlike this loom which is fitted with a 360 hook de Vogue jacquard and can weave very complex fabrics.|$|E

25|$|The Sowden worsted coating loom: {{as in all}} {{mechanical}} devices, {{there is}} drive to improve efficiency, and this loom has several patent innovations. For example, the 28 shaft negative square dobby is similar in construction to Hattersley's Keighley dobby. However, to allow the shuttle more time {{to pass through the}} shed the dobby has special curved slots that allow the shafts to dwell or remain open for longer. In addition, the pattern chain or lags controlling the shafts can be set to control all 28 shafts, or set to operate the first sixteen shafts to weave the cloth and the remaining twelve shafts to produce a name list or selvedge. The word selvedge is derived from self-edge, the edge of the cloth where the weft is turned back as it returns through the shed. The selvedge would often have a brand name or the country of origin woven into it. On {{the left side of the}} loom is the patent four-shuttle <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> motion incorporating a foot pedal. This is part of an escape mechanism in case the shuttle becomes trapped.|$|E

Using a security guard disguise he bought at a local costume shop, he put a sign over the box saying [...] "Out of Service, Place deposits with security guard on duty" [...] and collected money in that manner.

2500|$|The FBI claims, because {{anthrax spores}} {{were found in}} a postal <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> located [...] away from Princeton University's Kappa Kappa Gamma storage {{facility}} (where the Sorority keeps rush paraphernalia, initiation robes and other materials), that the anthrax laced letters had been mailed from that <b>drop</b> <b>box.</b> [...] As of this date, leaks from the law enforcement community claim {{they have not been}} able to place Ivins in Princeton, New Jersey the day the letters were mailed. [...] Katherine Breckinridge Graham, an advisor to Kappa's Princeton chapter, stated that there was nothing to indicate that any of the sorority members had anything to do with Ivins. Officials claim that the sorority link helps explain why the letters were mailed from Princeton, [...] from the Fort Detrick laboratory in Frederick, Maryland, where Ivins worked and where it is claimed the anthrax was produced.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the eve of}} the Industrial Revolution, {{spinning}} and weaving were done in households, for domestic consumption and as a cottage industry under the putting-out system. [...] Occasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver. Under the putting-out system, home-based workers produced under contract to merchant sellers, who often supplied the raw materials. [...] In the off season the women, typically farmers' wives, did the {{spinning and}} the men did the weaving. [...] Using the spinning wheel, it took anywhere from four to eight spinners to supply one hand loom weaver. [...] The flying shuttle patented in 1733 by John Kay, with a number of subsequent improvements including an important one in 1747, doubled the output of a weaver, worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving. [...] It became widely used around Lancashire after 1760 when John's son, Robert, invented the <b>drop</b> <b>box,</b> which facilitated changing thread colors.|$|E
60|$|The {{capacities}} of a chariot were considerable. Within, {{there was a}} good-sized seat for the principal occupants, and outside a dickey behind, and a driving box before, though sometimes {{there was only one}} of these, and that transferable. The boxes were calculated to hold family luggage on a six months' tour. There they lay on the spare-room floor, ready to be packed, the first earnest of our new possessions--except perhaps the five-pound note my father gave each of us four elder ones, on the day the balance at the bank was made over to him. There was the imperial, a grand roomy receptacle, which was placed {{on the top of the}} carriage, and would not always go upstairs in small houses; the capbox, which fitted into a curved place in front of the windows, and could not stand alone, but had a frame to support it; two long narrow boxes with the like infirmity of standing, which fitted in below; square ones under each seat; and a <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> fastened on behind. There were pockets beneath each window, and, curious relic in name and nature of the time when every gentleman carried his weapon, there was the sword case, an excrescence behind the back of the best seat, accessible by lifting a cushion, where weapons used to be carried, but where in our peaceful times travellers bestowed their luncheon and their books.|$|E

6000|$|The {{travelling}} carriage was generally yellow. It had two good seats inside, and a double {{one had a}} second seat, where two persons sat backwards. The cushion behind lifted up and disclosed a long narrow recess called the swordcase, because, when there were highwaymen on the roads, people kept their weapons there. There were sometimes two, sometimes one seat outside, called the box and the dickey--much the pleasantest places, for it was very easy to feel sick and giddy inside. A curved splashboard went {{up from the bottom}} of the chariot to a level with the window, and within it fitted what was called the cap box, with a curved bottom, so that when in a house it had to be set down in a frame to hold it upright. A big flat box, called the imperial, in which ladies put their dresses, was on the top of the carriage, two more long, narrow ones, generally used for shoes and linen, fitted under the seat, and another square one was hung below the dickey at the back, and called the <b>drop</b> <b>box.</b> Such a mischance has been known as, on an arrival, a servant coming in with the remains of this black box between his arms, saying--"Sir, should not this box have a bottom to it?" [...] The chariot thus carried plenty of goods, and was a sort of family home on a journey. To go to Plymouth, which now can be done in six or seven hours, then occupied two long days, halting for the night to sleep at an inn.|$|E
