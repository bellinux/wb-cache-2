5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E
5|$|Viktor Pugachyov, {{piloting}} {{the second}} Su-27K, {{became the first}} Russian to conventionally land aboard an aircraft carrier on 1 November 1989. It {{was found that the}} carrier's <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflectors were too close to the engine nozzles when raised at an angle of 60°; thus an improvised solution held the deflectors at 45°. However, when the aircraft was in front of it for longer than the maximum six seconds, the shield's water pipes exploded. The pilot, Pugachyov, reduced engine throttle, accidentally causing the detents (blocks used to restrain aircraft from accelerating) to retract and the fighter to move forwards. The aircraft was quickly stopped; Pugachyov later took off without the use of blast deflectors or detents. Since then, a Kamov Ka-27PS search-and-rescue helicopter was flown close to the carrier in case of an accident.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} use <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflectors at {{the rear}} of aircraft catapults, positioned to protect other aircraft from exhaust blast damage. <b>Jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflectors are made of heavy duty material that is raised and lowered by hydraulic cylinders or linear actuators. The <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflector lies flush with and serves as a portion of the flight deck until the aircraft to be launched rolls over it {{on the way to the}} catapult. When the aircraft is clear of the deflector, the heavy panel is raised into position to redirect the hot <b>jet</b> <b>blast.</b> As soon as the deflector is raised, another aircraft can be brought into position behind it, and flight deck personnel can perform final readiness duties without the danger of hot, violent exhaust gases. Such systems were installed on aircraft carriers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as jet-powered aircraft began to appear in navies.|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to carry out a {{comparison}} of grit blasting and other surface pretreatment processes and identify the relation between grit blasting parameters and coating adhesion, because it can be assumed that the adhesion between substrate and coating strongly depends on the physical properties of the substrate surface. By this way, in order to improve the bonding between substrate and coating, it is necessary to study the influence of different surface pre-treatment parameters and to compare different pre-treatment techniques. Grit <b>blasting,</b> water <b>jet</b> <b>blasting</b> and mechanicals processes (milling and grinding) have been studied. In order to compare them, the roughness of the surface, the adhesive straights, the topography, the contact surface and the residual stresses have been the considered parameters to carry out the research. Two different substrates have been studied, AlMg 7 and St_ 42. For grit blasting, five different blasting parameters have been analyzed and combined to obtain reliable results, attack angle, air pressure, lineal velocity, number of passes, and distance between substrate and nozzle. After measuring the obtained values, the most influence parameters were recombined and analyzed to obtain better surface conditions. In the case of mechanicals processes (milling and grinding), the samples were studied for different mechanical parameters, analyzed and compared with the other surface pretreatments in order to obtain the most suitable method. For water <b>jet</b> <b>blasting,</b> eight samples were sent to WLH (University of Hannover) to be treated. To carry out the pretreatment, the velocity of the water <b>jet</b> <b>blasting</b> was modify while the other blasting parameters remained constant, in order to compare the obtained values of roughness, adhesion, activate area and residual stresses for water <b>jet</b> with grit <b>blasting</b> and mechanical processes. The next conclusions can be assumed: The roughness is not so important than the topography to obtain the best adhesive bonding between the substrate and the coating, and the best bonding was obtained for homogeneous topographies (obtained for water <b>jet</b> <b>blasting</b> and grit blasting). Comparing the surface pretreatments is observed that water <b>jet</b> <b>blasting</b> is the surface pretreatment method which leads to the highest bonding between substrate and coating. It can be assumed that a higher contact surface area leads to a better adhesion between substrate and coating. The residual stresses strongly depend on the surface pretreatment used. Grit blasting leads to the highest compressive stresses while water <b>jet</b> <b>blasting</b> almost does not cause variations and grinding obtains the same values than for a raw surface (untreated surface).

5000|$|However, {{the origin}} of the burst was soon disputed, and by April 2016 it was {{established}} that the emission instead originates from an active galactic nucleus that is powered by a supermassive black hole with dual <b>jets</b> <b>blasting</b> outward from the black hole.

25|$|The {{accident}} {{aircraft was}} a 19-passenger de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, registration LN-BNK.

30|$|When {{perforating}} with an abrasive water jet, it {{is possible}} that the pressure in the hole (perforation) will be higher than that in the annulus because of water <b>jet</b> <b>blasting</b> against the hole wall, which also is the theoretical basis for the technology of hydro-jet fracturing. This paper analyzes the mechanism of generating pressure stagnation in water jet hole, and puts forward a new concept of hydroseal. Then, the distribution of pressure in the hole was simulated with the finite element method. The simulation results showed that the pressure in the hole was higher than that in the annulus. Also, the lower the annular pressure (confining pressure) and the higher the blasting pressure, the greater the pressure difference. An experiment indicated that the cement sample was lifted up under the pressure stagnation in the hole, which proved the finite element simulation results obviously.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{explanation}} for the unusual temporal feature of the GRB 030226 afterglow. The R-band afterglow of this burst faded as ~ t^{- 1. 2 } in ~ 0. 2 days after the burst, rebrightened during the period of ~ 0. 2 - 0. 5 days, and then declined with ~ t^{- 2. 0 }. To fit such a light curve, we consider an ultrarelativistic <b>jetted</b> <b>blast</b> wave expanding in a density-jump medium. The interaction of the blast wave with a large density jump produces relativistic reverse and forward shocks. In this model, the observed rebrightening is due to emissions from these newly forming shocks, and the late-time afterglow is caused by sideways expansion of the jet. Our fitting implies that the progenitor star of GRB 030226 could have produced a stellar wind with a large density jump prior to the GRB onset.

25|$|On the Boeing YC-14, the upper-surface-blowing {{design for}} high {{aerodynamic}} lift used two jet engines that blew high-velocity airstreams over the inboard {{section of the}} wing and over special trailing-edge flaps. The large multisection flaps extended rearward and downward from the wing's trailing edge to increase the wing area, thus creating extra lift, which was further augmented by positioning the engines so their <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> across the upper wing surfaces created still more lift. In addition, {{the placement of the}} engines above the wing prevented the engines from ingesting dirt and debris and shielded some of the engine noise from the ground so that the transport could make a quieter approach.|$|E

Baggage claim carousels, runways, and taxiways were expanded, and two new freighter aircraft stands and two remote aircraft parking stands built. Two aircraft taxiway bridges spanning Airport Boulevard leading to the terminals also had shields installed on either side to shield the road from the <b>jet</b> <b>blast.</b> On 11 November 2005, the airport became the first outside Europe to receive the A380 for airport compatibility verification tests, and was the first in the world to have an operational triple-passenger loading bridge fit for trials.|$|E

40|$|Waterjet {{technology}} has been extensively used in machining processes since 1970 ’s, {{and in the last}} years it has evolved to a precision machining tool for mi-cro workpieces, namely micro abrasive-waterjet blasting (µAWJB); neverthe-less, as a finishing process to remove micro-burrs it has not been yet developed. Our experimental studies on low-pressure µAWJB showed that conventional nozzles which are used for micro abrasive air <b>jet</b> <b>blasting</b> are subject to clog-ging at the mixing chamber. In this study, the venturi principle is exploited in order to obtain a novel nozzle design which will not lead to the clogging problem. The factors are considered as follows: the volumetric flow rate, the contraction–expansion ratios, the length of the cylindrical throat and the lo-cation of the attached (side) pipe. Various geometries are considered and a number of numerical simulations are performed to analyze these factors so that a nozzle which is suitable for low-pressure µAWJB can be constructed in light of the numerical results. The nozzle which is chosen in accordance with the numerical findings is proven to be operational with experimental studies. 1 1...|$|R
40|$|Following a {{suggestion}} that a directed relativistic explosion may have a universal intermediate asymptotic, we derive a self-similar solution for an ultra-relativistic <b>jetted</b> <b>blast</b> wave. The solution involves three distinct regions: an approximately paraboloid head where the Lorentz factor γ exceeds ∼ 1 / 2 of its maximal, nose value; a geometrically self-similar, expanding envelope slightly narrower than a paraboloid; and an axial core in which the (cylindrically, henceforth) radial flow u converges inward towards the axis. Most (∼ 80 %) of the energy lies well beyond the leading, head region. Here, a radial cross section shows a maximal γ (separating the core and the envelope), a sign reversal in u, and a minimal γ, at respectively ∼ 1 / 6, ∼ 1 / 4, and ∼ 3 / 4 of the shock radius. The solution is apparently unique, and approximately agrees with previous simulations, of different initial conditions, that resolved the head. This suggests that unlike a spherical relativistic blast wave, our solution is an attractor, and may thus describe directed blast waves {{such as in the}} external shock phase of a γ-ray burst.

50|$|On {{the other}} side of The Beach is the third tower, {{featuring}} five slides also by WhiteWater West: Half Pipe, Typhoon, Tropical Cyclone, The Breakers, and AquaTube. All of the slides on this tower use two-person inline tubes. Half Pipe is a Boomerango of a similar design to Bombora; however, the exit chute from the vertical wall features a small camel hump for a second moment of weightlessness. Typhoon is a Rattler where riders slide down open flume sections before entering two cylinders at right angles. Riders oscillate back and forth inside the cylinders before emerging and continuing with the open slide. Tropical Cyclone is a Constrictor, a slide characterised by three wide helices. Internally, these helices measure 2.1 m in diameter as opposed to the 1.3 m diameter evidenced {{in the rest of the}} slide. The Breakers are a set of four Master Blaster slides. These slides mimic roller coasters by providing not only descents, but ascents as well. Ascents are achieved though water <b>jets</b> <b>blasting</b> the raft uphill.

In Hawaii, littoral explosion activities (i.e., lava–sea water interactions) were observed in the period 1992 – 1994 (Mattox and Mangan 1997). The explosions occurred in a lava tube system on a lava delta, not in a fissure vent system. The explosions were unusual. The longest duration was 43  h, and bubble bursts, lava fountains, steam <b>jets,</b> lithic <b>blasts,</b> and tephra <b>jets</b> were observed. Mattox and Mangan (1997) noted that the trigger of the littoral eruptions was {{the collapse of a}} bench (bounded inland by an ocean-facing scarp).

The explosions occurred where lava flowed into gullies, not at the fissure vent. As a result of these explosions, small tephra cones (i.e., rootless cones) formed, though they later disappeared due to the coverage by subsequent lava flow (Á. Höskuldsson, personal communication).

By means of fast flow visualization with an appropriate recording window, we focus solely on the first instants during which the external particle ring becomes unstable. We find that the critical area of the destabilization of the external ring surface is constant regardless of the acceleration of the initial layer. Moreover, we observe in detail the external front perturbation wavelength, rendered dimensionless by the initial ring perimeter, and follow its evolution with the initial particle layer acceleration. We report this quantity to be constant regardless of the evolution of the initial particle layer acceleration. Finally, we can reasonably assert that external front perturbations depend solely on the material of the particles...|$|R
