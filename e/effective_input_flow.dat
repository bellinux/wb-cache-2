Many different methods have been presented for these channels but extending them for all types of compound channels with different geometrical and hydraulic conditions is certainly difficult. In this study, by aid of nearly 400 laboratory and field data sets of geometry and flow rating curves from 30 different straight compound sections and using artificial neural networks (ANNs), flow discharge in compound channels was estimated. 13 dimensionless input variables including relative depth, relative roughness, relative width, aspect ratio, bed slope, main channel side slopes, flood plains side slopes and berm inclination and one output variable (flow discharge), have been used in ANNs. Comparison of ANNs model and traditional method (divided channel method-DCM) shows high accuracy of ANNs model results. The results of Sensitivity analysis showed that the relative depth with 47. 6 percent contribution, is the most <b>effective</b> <b>input</b> parameter for <b>flow</b> discharge prediction. Relative width and relative roughness have 19. 3 and 12. 2 percent of importance, respectively. On the other hand, shape parameter, main channel and flood plains side slopes with 2. 1, 3. 8 and 3. 8 percent of contribution, have the least importance.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new control strategy for highly loaded anaerobic digestion processes. This strategy {{is based on}} the analysis of disturbances added on purpose to the influent flow rate. The control system then carefully overlooks the response of only two parameters, the biogas output flow rate and the pH, in order {{to determine whether or not}} the load can be increased. The main advantages of this approach rely on its capability to automatically adapt the <b>input</b> <b>flow</b> rate to changes in the influ-ent concentration, without any information on its concentration, and to optimize the biological treat-ment in relation to the influent degradability. Experiments have been carried out using two fluidized bed reactors of dierent sizes and they have demonstrated very good capability of this control strategy. In addition, since only very simple sensors are needed, industrial applications of this strategy can be expected. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

For example, a transformation written to refactor Java models can {{be applicable to}} refactoring UML class diagrams as both languages share concepts such as classes, methods, attributes, inheritance. Deriving motivation from this example, we present an approach to make model transformations reusable such that they function correctly across several similar metamodels. Our approach relies on these principal steps: (1) We analyze a transformation to obtain an effective subset of used concepts. We prune the input metamodel of the transformation to obtain an <b>effective</b> <b>input</b> metamodel containing the effective subset. The <b>effective</b> <b>input</b> metamodel represents the true input domain of transformation. (2) We adapt a target input metamodel by weaving it with aspects such as properties derived from the <b>effective</b> <b>input</b> metamodel to ultimately make it a subtype of the <b>effective</b> <b>input</b> metamodel. The subtype property ensures that the transformation can process models conforming to the target input metamodel without {{any change in the}} transformation itself.

Maize pollen exposure was measured within the FFH Ruhlsdorfer Bruch and its immediate vicinity in July and August 2007 and 2008. In 2007, the sampling was performed at three sites using 12 technical samplers (Sigma- 2 /PMF) placed at five measuring points at distances from 5  m to 120  m from the maize field edges. Additionally, for biological pollen sampling six bee colonies were situated at these three sites (two colonies at each site). The technical sampler Sigma- 2 /PMF enables point sampling which is primarily influenced by wind and topography providing information on <b>effective</b> maize pollen <b>input</b> (<b>flow</b> and deposition) at the measuring sites. Honey-bees roaming in the surrounding area with typical foraging distances of several kilometres may act as planar collectors. They may serve as indicators for the exposure to pollen-collecting NTOs. Furthermore, biological sampling is more selective due to the organism’s preferences, whereas the technical sampling is neutral. Hence, both the technical and the biological sampling complement each other in their scope of application. The pollen samples of both matrices were analysed microscopically and the maize pollen loads were quantified. Pollen-DNA was analysed by means of the quantitative PCR-method (qPCR) identifying conventional and Bt-maize pollen by two independent laboratories. In 2008, the monitoring was repeated with additional sites. Eighteen technical samplers were exposed at five sites with eight measuring points at distances from 5  m to 250  m from the maize field edges. Two honey-bee colonies for biological sampling were placed at one site for control purposes. PCR-analyses were performed to measure the amounts of Bt-maize pollen in the samples.|$|R
