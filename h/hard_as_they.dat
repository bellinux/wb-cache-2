25|$|After the May 15, 1934 coup all {{associations}} and independent business organizations had to shut down, this affected German community especially <b>hard,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> lost their ancient communal centers – guilds, {{and all of}} their property was nationalized. Then followed a wave of takeovers of Jewish, Russian and German businesses – banks, factories and trading companies were purchased by state owned bank at set rates {{in order to reduce}} minority control over businesses.|$|E
25|$|Mock bombardments of {{imaginary}} shore {{positions were}} carried out by Prince David in Saanich Inlet, and equally imaginary shore batteries fired back, while movie raiders rowed the ship's boats ashore as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could. A ship-handling problem peculiar to this operation was that in every scene where Prince David was to appear herself, she could present only her starboard side to the camera. It was calculated that cinema-goers would not likely accept the huge sound truck that had been hoisted aboard, and reposed on the weather deck port side, as a regular item in Combined Operations weaponry. The ship's company co-operated heartily, and kept up a high standard of discipline and war-readiness despite the distractions of this fling with film fame, and the glitter of hob-nobbing with the film famous.|$|E

500|$|Georgia Tech coach John Heisman later {{described}} Strupper as follows:"Everett Strupper {{was a small}} {{package of}} condensed lightning when you turned him loose in an open field with a ball you wanted delivered somewhere {{in the neighborhood of}} the enemy's goal line. He was small, but he was put together like a high-powered motor. His arms and legs did just what his mind told them to do, and, believe me, his mind worked faster than Ty Cobb's when he's running the bases. Dodging and twisting, stiff-arming and hipping, he'd run the gauntlet of men big enough, you'd think, to pick him up and spank him, and most of the time, too, he'd get away from them, try as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> would." ...|$|E
500|$|Mullins {{found that}} [...] "To choreograph a fight is {{constantly}} {{trying to be}} open to doing things differently, and making things creative as possible. Any sequence that you ever do, it doesn’t matter if it’s two punches or 50 punches. The same amount of danger is always there. In order to make something look organic and real, the performers and stunt performers have got to punch each other as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> can ... Both of us—myself and Sam—we worked with Kevin [...] on , so we knew the level that the director was wanting. So we both felt every piece had to be awesome, because he’s known for putting together amazing sequences that are both unique and hard hitting." [...] Jo also noted that [...] "trying to come up with things people haven’t seen before. There have been so many action movies and so many Marvel movies, you’re constantly wanting to set the bar higher and higher. And it feels like the moves that are even possible just get narrower and narrower cause they’ve been done before." [...] Tancharoen later reflected that [...] "everyone really liked the May versus May fight", and so he and the stunt team would use it as a benchmark to overcome when designing action sequences for future episodes.|$|E
500|$|York {{recorded}} {{their first}} victory since early September 2014 after winning 1–0 away against Cheltenham Town, De Girolamo scoring from a Coulson {{pass in the}} 43rd minute. De Girolamo was recalled early from his loan spell by Sheffield United as they wanted him for their two upcoming cup fixtures, after he had scored three times in four York matches. Bournemouth's Guadeloupe international defender Stéphane Zubar joined on loan until 4 January 2015, with Parslow being loaned back to Grimsby until the same date. York drew 1–1 {{at home with their}} divisional rivals AFC Wimbledon {{in the first round of}} the FA Cup; Hyde gave York the lead in the eighth minute after scoring from Coulson's low cross, before Andy Frampton equalised for the away team on 22 minutes. Burton was ruled out for two to three months with a medial ligament injury suffered in this match, resulting in his loan at the club being curtailed. York signed 19-year-old Middlesbrough defender Brad Halliday on a one-month loan as cover and competition for McCoy. Fellow strugglers Oxford United won 1–0 at York, James Roberts scoring from threeyards after Danny Hylton flicked on a Brian Howard corner in the 35th minute, and Wilcox surmised the result saying [...] "The lads are working as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> possibly can but I'm just looking for a little bit more now".|$|E

Clinton said she would also evaluate the relief effort and help evacuate some Americans. She stressed that her visit was designed not to interfere with ongoing efforts: [...] "It's a race against time. Everybody is pushing as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> can." [...] The Clintons had a special interest in Haiti going back decades, to their delayed honeymoon there up to Bill Clinton being the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti {{at the time of the}} earthquake.|$|E
2500|$|Early on at Midvale, {{working as}} a laborer and machinist, Taylor {{recognized}} that workmen were not working their machines, or themselves, nearly as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could (which {{at the time was}} called [...] "") and that this resulted in high labor costs for the company. When he became a foreman he expected more output from the workmen. In order to determine how much work should properly be expected, he began to study and analyze the productivity of both the men and the machines (although the word [...] "productivity" [...] was not used at the time, and the applied science of productivity had not yet been developed). His focus on the human component of production Taylor labeled scientific management.|$|E
2500|$|The middle rowers of a crew (numbers 2 and 3 in a four, and 3, 4, 5 and 6 in an eight) are {{normally}} {{the most powerful}} and heaviest rowers, colloquially known as the Fuel Tank, Engine Room, Power House or Meat Wagon. [...] The boat pitches and yaws less in the middle, and the rowers there have less effect on these movements, being closer to the centre of mass and centre of buoyancy. [...] Therefore, the rowers {{in the middle of the}} boat do not have to be as technically sound or reactive to the movements of the boat, and can focus more on pulling as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> can. It is common practice among crews to put the most technically proficient rowers at the bow and stern and the physically strongest and heaviest rowers in the centre.|$|E

2500|$|Animal welfare {{groups have}} {{documented}} {{many cases of}} animal cruelty in the training of performing circus animals. The animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) contends that animals in circuses are frequently beaten into submission and that physical abuse {{has always been the}} method for training circus animals. According to PETA, although the US Animal Welfare Act does not permit the use of electric shock prods, whips, hooks, or similar instruments by trainers, these are still used today. According to PETA, during an undercover investigation of Carson & Barnes Circus, video footage was captured showing animal care director Tim Frisco training endangered Asian elephants with electrical shock prods and instructing other trainers to [...] "beat the elephants with a bullhook as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could and to sink the sharp metal bullhook into the animals' flesh and twist it until they screamed in pain." ...|$|E

30|$|We {{estimated}} {{the age of}} locusts collected, by three criteria: body hardness, hind wing color, and evidence of recent oviposition (in females only). The cuticle is soft in 6 -day-old solitarious adults, but becomes <b>harder</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> age (Duranton and Lecoq 1990). Likewise, the hind wings of 6 -day-old solitarious adults are transparent, but become yellow when locusts become sexually mature (Norris 1954; Pener 1991). Female adults produce foam to plug a digging hole during oviposition. The presence of foam adhering to the ovipositor valves indicates that adult females have already deposited eggs at least once, and therefore {{must be at least}} 15 -day-old.|$|R
