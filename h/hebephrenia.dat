500|$|The {{history of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{is complex and}} does not lend itself easily to a linear narrative. Accounts of a schizophrenia-like syndrome {{are thought to be}} rare in historical records before the 19th century, although reports of irrational, unintelligible, or uncontrolled behavior were common. A detailed case report in 1797 concerning James Tilly Matthews, and accounts by Philippe Pinel published in 1809, are often regarded as the earliest cases of the illness in the medical and psychiatric literature. The Latinized term dementia praecox was first used by German alienist Heinrich Schule in 1886 and then in 1891 by Arnold Pick in a case report of a psychotic disorder (<b>hebephrenia).</b> In 1893 Emil Kraepelin borrowed the term from Schule and Pick and in 1899 introduced a broad new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between dementia praecox and mood disorder (termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression). [...] Kraepelin believed that dementia praecox was probably caused by a long-term, smouldering systemic or [...] "whole body" [...] disease process that affected many organs and peripheral nerves in the body but which affected the brain after puberty in a final decisive cascade. [...] His use of the term [...] "praecox" [...] distinguished it from other forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease which typically occur later in life. It is sometimes argued that {{the use of the term}} démence précoce in 1852 by the French physician Bénédict Morel constitutes the medical discovery of schizophrenia. However, this account ignores the fact that there is little to connect Morel's descriptive use of the term and the independent development of the dementia praecox disease concept at the end of the nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} half of the century, Karl Kahlbaum and Ewald Hecker {{developed}} a descriptive categorizion of syndromes, employing terms such as dysthymia, cyclothymia, catatonia, paranoia and <b>hebephrenia.</b> Wilhelm Griesinger (1817–1869) advanced a unitary scheme based on a concept of brain pathology. French psychiatrists Jules Baillarger described [...] "folie à double forme" [...] and Jean-Pierre Falret described [...] "la folie circulaire"—alternating mania and depression.|$|E
2500|$|Influenced by the {{approach}} of Kahlbaum and others, and developing his concepts in publications spanning {{the turn of the}} century, German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin advanced a new system. He grouped together a number of existing diagnoses that appeared to all have a deteriorating course over time—such as catatonia, <b>hebephrenia</b> and dementia paranoides—under another existing term [...] "dementia praecox" [...] (meaning [...] "early senility", later renamed schizophrenia). Another set of diagnoses that appeared to have a periodic course and better outcome were grouped together under the category of manic-depressive insanity (mood disorder). He also proposed a third category of psychosis, called paranoia, involving delusions but not the more general deficits and poor course attributed to dementia praecox. In all he proposed 15 categories, also including psychogenic neurosis, psychopathic personality, and syndromes of defective mental development (mental retardation). He eventually included homosexuality in the category of [...] "mental conditions of constitutional origin".|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1870s Kahlbaum and Hecker did {{a series of}} studies on young {{psychotic}} patients at Kahlbaum's clinic in Görlitz, Prussia. Together they provided clinical analyses of the mentally ill, and arranged their disorders into specific, descriptive categories. It was during this period that Hecker developed the concepts of <b>hebephrenia</b> and cyclothymia. He described <b>hebephrenia</b> as a disorder that begins in adolescence with erratic behaviour followed by a rapid decline of all mental functions, and cyclothymia as a cyclical mood disorder.|$|E

5000|$|The fourth {{edition of}} his textbook, Psychiatrie, {{published}} in 1893, two years after his arrival at Heidelberg, contained some impressions of the patterns Kraepelin had begun to find in his index cards. Prognosis (course and outcome) began to feature alongside signs and symptoms {{in the description of}} syndromes, and he added a class of psychotic disorders designated [...] "psychic degenerative processes", three of which were borrowed from Kahlbaum and Hecker: dementia paranoides (a degenerative type of Kahlbaum's paranoia, with sudden onset), catatonia (per Kahlbaum, 1874) and dementia praecox, (Hecker's <b>hebephrenia</b> of 1871). Kraepelin continued to equate dementia praecox with <b>hebephrenia</b> for the next six years.|$|E
5000|$|The {{condition}} {{is also known}} as <b>hebephrenia,</b> named after the Greek term for [...] "a boy" [...] - hebeos, and possibly the ancient Greek goddess of youth, Hebe, daughter of Hera. The term refers to the ostensibly more prominent appearance of the disorder in persons around puberty.|$|E
5000|$|Together Kahlbaum and Hecker {{were the}} first to {{describe}} and name such syndromes as dysthymia, cyclothymia, paranoia, catatonia, and <b>hebephrenia.</b> Perhaps their most lasting contribution to psychiatry was the introduction of the [...] "clinical method" [...] from medicine to the study of mental diseases, a method which is now known as psychopathology.|$|E

5000|$|E.B. Strauss {{stated that}} {{schizophrenia}} could come about in two ways: either catastrophically {{or through a}} series of 'attacks'. [...] Strauss used catastrophic to refer to schizophrenia that ran a rapidly progressing and continuous course. [...] According to Strauss, catastrophic schizophrenia took a similar course to catatonic schizophrenia and <b>hebephrenia,</b> with all three ending in the total collapse into psychosis within two to four years.|$|E

50|$|As a psychiatrist, Kahlbaum {{realized}} that attempting to group mental disorders based on similarities of outward symptoms was futile, {{and in his}} work tried to develop a classification system that grouped mental diseases according to their course and outcome. He is remembered for research done at Görlitz with his associate Ewald Hecker (1843-1909) involving studies of young psychotic patients. In their analyses of mental disorders, Kahlbaum and Hecker introduced a classification system that used descriptive terms such as dysthymia, cyclothymia, catatonia, paraphrenia and <b>hebephrenia.</b> In their research they were pioneers {{in the application of}} modern clinical practices in the study of mental health.|$|E
50|$|The terms {{schizophrenia}} and autism {{originated from}} {{the works of}} Eugene Bleuler (1857-1939) as {{different aspects of the}} same diagnostic condition. Bleuler was a contemporary of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Prior to Bleuler's interventions schizophrenia was referred to as dementia praecox (early insanity) and perceived as a single disorder. Schizophrenia is sometimes also referred to as <b>hebephrenia,</b> stemming in etymology from the Greek god Hebe who was associated with adolescence and as it was thought the onset of schizophrenia came at adolescence. It is generally acknowledged that schizophrenia can have early onset and late onset.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "dementia praecox" [...] {{was first}} used in 1891 by Arnold Pick (1851-1924), a {{professor}} of psychiatry at Charles University in Prague. His brief clinical report described the case of a person with a psychotic disorder resembling <b>hebephrenia.</b> German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) popularised it in his first detailed textbook descriptions of a condition that eventually became a different disease concept and relabeled as schizophrenia. [...] Kraepelin reduced the complex psychiatric taxonomies of the nineteenth century by dividing them into two classes: manic-depressive psychosis and dementia praecox. This division, commonly referred to as the Kraepelinian dichotomy, had a fundamental impact on twentieth-century psychiatry, though it has also been questioned.|$|E
5000|$|Drawing on his {{long-term}} research, {{and using}} the criteria of course, outcome and prognosis, he developed the concept of dementia praecox, which he defined as the [...] "sub-acute development of a peculiar simple condition of mental weakness occurring at a youthful age". When he first introduced this concept as a diagnostic entity in the fourth German edition of his Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie in 1893, it was placed among the degenerative disorders alongside, but separate from, catatonia and dementia paranoides. At that time, the concept corresponded by and large with Ewald Hecker's <b>hebephrenia.</b> In the sixth edition of the Lehrbuch in 1899 {{all three of these}} clinical types are treated as different expressions of one disease, dementia praecox.|$|E
5000|$|The Heebs {{consist of}} people {{suffering}} from <b>hebephrenia</b> (disorganized schizophrenia). Their settlement is Gandhitown. To the other clans, they are useful only for manual labour. Their representative is Jacob Simion. Gandhitown looks like [...] "an inhabited garbage dump of cardboard dwellings." [...] Like the Skitzes, some of the Heebs are religious visionaries as well; but they are inclined to produce ascetic saints, whereas the schizophrenics produce dogmatists. An example is [...] "the famous Heeb saint, Ignatz Ledebur, who radiated spirituality as he wandered from town to town, spreading {{the warmth of his}} harmless Heeb personality." [...] Another notable Heeb character is Sarah Apostoles; she together with Omar Diamond and Ignatz Ledebur form [...] "the so-called Holy Triumvirate." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the March 1896 fifth {{edition of}} Psychiatrie, Kraepelin {{expressed}} confidence that his clinical method, involving analysis of both {{qualitative and quantitative}} data derived from long term observation of patients, would produce reliable diagnoses including prognosis: What convinced me of {{the superiority of the}} clinical method of diagnosis (followed here) over the traditional one, was the certainty with which we could predict (in conjunction with our new concept of disease) the future course of events. Thanks to it the student can now find his way more easily in the difficult subject of psychiatry. In this edition dementia praecox is still essentially <b>hebephrenia,</b> and it, dementia paranoides and catatonia are described as distinct psychotic disorders among the [...] "metabolic disorders leading to dementia".|$|E

5000|$|A {{detailed}} case 1809 {{report by}} John Haslam concerning James Tilly Matthews, {{and a separate}} account by Philippe Pinel also published in 1809, are often regarded as the earliest cases of schizophrenia in the medical and psychiatric literature. The Latinized term dementia praecox entered psychiatry in 1886 in a textbook by asylum physician Heinrich Schüle (1840-1916) of the Illenau asylum in Baden. He used the term to refer to hereditarily predisposed individuals who were [...] "wrecked on the cliffs of puberty" [...] and developed acute dementia, while others developed the chronic condition of <b>hebephrenia.</b> Emil Kraepelin had cited Schüle's 1886 textbook in the 1887 second edition of his own textbook, Psychiatrie, and hence was familiar with this term at least six years before he himself adopted it. [...] It later appeared in 1891 in a case report by Arnold Pick which argued that <b>hebephrenia</b> {{should be regarded as}} a form of dementia praecox. Kraepelin first used the term in 1893. In 1899 Emil Kraepelin introduced a broad new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between dementia praecox and mood disorder (termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression). Kraepelin believed that dementia praecox was caused by a lifelong, smoldering systemic or [...] "whole body" [...] process of a metabolic nature that would eventually affect the functioning of the brain in a final decisive cascade. Hence, he believed the entire body—all the organs, glands and peripheral nervous system—was implicated in the natural disease process. Although he used the term [...] "dementia," [...] Kraepelin seemed to use the term synonymously with [...] "mental weakness," [...] mental defect," [...] and [...] "mental deterioration," [...] but distinguished it from other uses of the term dementia, such as in Alzheimer's disease, which typically occur later in life. In 1853 Bénédict Morel used the term démence précoce (precocious or early dementia) to describe a group of young patients who were suffering from [...] "stupor". It is sometimes argued that this first use of the term signals the medical discovery of schizophrenia. However, Morel employed the phrase in a purely descriptive sense and he did not intend to delineate a new diagnostic category. Moreover, his traditional conception of dementia differed significantly from that employed {{in the latter half of}} the nineteenth-century. Finally, there is no evidence that Morel's démence précoce had any influence on the later development of the dementia praecox concept by either Arnold Pick or Emil Kraepelin.|$|E

40|$|In ancient Greece, 5 b. C., Hippocrates {{tried to}} {{establish}} a classification system for mental illnesses. Words such as hysteria, mania and melancholy were used to characterize some of them. Over the centuries, a number of terms have been incorporated into the medical jargon, as for example: circular madness, catatonia, <b>hebephrenia,</b> paranoia, etc. The first system including a comprehensive classification and with real scientific profile arose with the studies by Emil Kraepelin (1856 - 1926), who gathered different mental disorders under a single denomination – dementia praecox, later termed schizophrenia by Bleuler – together with other psychotic disorders, separating them from the clinical status of manic-depressive psychosis. 1 Almost at the same time, Freud (1895) differentiated a syndrome from neurasthenia, named anguish neurosis, which started to be classified and studied {{with other types of}} neurosis: hypochondriac, hysteric, phobic and obsessive-compulsive. 2 Such terminology was used up to the 1980 s. In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) published the first edition of the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ” (DSM-I). The next editions, published in 1968 (DSM-II), 1980 (DSM-III), 1987 (DSM-III-R) and 1994 (DSM-IV) were reviewed, modified and enlarged. ...|$|E
