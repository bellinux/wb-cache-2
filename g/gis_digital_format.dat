40|$|ABSTRACT: With {{the recent}} rapid {{development}} of the Internet and portable multimedia terminals, the concept of GIS has been introduced to many aspects of our daily life. Although the <b>digital</b> map and <b>GIS</b> service systems abruptly increased on the Internet, the vast amount of geographical information data and the limited speed of the service cause problems when the GIS data for the actual users are transmitted through the Internet and saved in the portable terminals in a short time. In this study, the most efficient technique to transmit the large-volume <b>GIS</b> <b>digital</b> map images is identified to address such problems. First, the file-based digital map v 2. 0 and shape files, the XML-based 3 DF-GML, GML, CityGML and KML, and the database-based geodatabase files are used to form layers in the 3 D GIS engine, and the data are transmitted to the simulator. Second, there is the streaming technique for the digital map screen images. In this method, the administrator and users connect to the server, and the 3 D GIS engine and diverse <b>GIS</b> <b>digital</b> map information on the administrator screen are transmitted to the users in the forms of screen captures or streaming service. In this study, {{the characteristics of the}} two methods are examined, and the more efficient way to deliver the <b>GIS</b> <b>digital</b> map information is determined. The detailed features of the chosen large-volume <b>GIS</b> <b>digital</b> map transmission method are designed, and the items that should be considered are identified...|$|R

Therefore, the highest possible capture is always desired.|$|R
