5|$|The {{constitutional}} amendment gave autonomy {{to the city}} of Buenos Aires, allowing it to sanction local laws and elect its own mayor, who was previously appointed {{by the president of the}} nation. De la Rúa was the first mayor elected in this manner, defeating the previous mayor Jorge Domínguez. During his term of office he created or reformulated several institutions to <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> status of the city, as required by the national constitution and the recently approved Constitution of Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Other {{victims were}} college students, {{many of whom}} were {{expelled}} from their institutions and had their careers destroyed, academic teachers who tried to defend the students and the academic institutions themselves: Warsaw University had several departments administratively dissolved. Liberal intelligentsia members, Jewish or not, were removed from the government and other places of employment. Leftist intellectuals and student leaders lost what was left of their faith in the ostensibly socialist government. Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> environment of intolerance and hatred. The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomułka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which, early in his term, gave Gomułka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 version {{supports}} display {{resolutions of}} 720p and 1080p – the former with {{and the latter}} without anti-aliasing – while the Vita version runs at 720x408 pixels. Graphical features such as the water effects and lighting were improved. Other changes include the addition of bloom, the move from circular to dynamic shadows and tweaks to environmental geometry and texturing. The developers revised the 3D models for both games: most models merely received new textures but those of the playable characters were rebuilt completely with noticeable changes to their faces. The cutscenes and prerendered environments needed to be adjusted from a 4:3 to a 16:9 screen ratio, the process of which required lots of art and programming readjustments. For example, the widescreen display led to character models being visible in a cutscene although they were to appear only in a later shot; these instances had to be corrected. Both the prerendered background images and cutscenes were cropped {{at the top and}} bottom to <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> screen ratio. However, they received a bump in resolution to appear much clearer than in the PlayStation 2 version. The gameplay also needed to be duplicated while bringing it up to the standard of a high definition game, which was harder than the team thought.|$|E

5|$|Carlisle {{made his}} Preston {{debut in the}} opening match of the campaign, a 4–2 home defeat against Colchester on 6 August 2011. Three matches later, he scored his first goal for the club, netting the opening goal from a corner kick in the 2–0 away win over Chesterfield. He was a regular starter for Preston during the opening months {{of the season and}} also played in the cup {{competitions}} as the team reached the third round of the League Cup before being eliminated by Southampton and progressed to the same stage of the Football League Trophy with penalty shoot-out victories over Morecambe and Rochdale. He was handed a one-match ban after receiving his fifth yellow card of the campaign in the FA Cup first round defeat to Southend United on 22 November 2011. Preston manager Phil Brown brought in Jamie McCombe on loan as cover for Carlisle, and the Huddersfield Town loanee kept his place in the starting line-up throughout December 2011. Carlisle returned to the Preston team for the visit to Rochdale on 2 January 2012, when he was selected to play alongside Craig Morgan by caretaker managers Graham Alexander and David Unsworth. He played five times during that month, scoring on his 27th and final appearance for the club in the 1–2 loss to Yeovil Town. Following the appointment of Graham Westley as Preston manager, Carlisle struggled to <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> training regime in with his commitments as chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association and his loan deal was cancelled by mutual consent on 31 January 2012.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the F-11A (F11F-1) fighter, Grumman also proposed a more advanced version of the airframe known as the F11F-1F Super Tiger. This {{was the result of}} a 1955 study to <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> General Electric J79 engine into the F11F-1 airframe.|$|E
25|$|Centaurus I {{featured}} {{several major}} design adjustments from both previous series of cars. Due {{to a change}} in the North American Solar Challenge rules for 2008 requiring the driver to sit upright, the team was faced with the task of allowing the driver to do this while still minimizing aerodynamic drag. Many design components were reworked to <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> style of vehicle and improve performance.|$|E

Hydraulic brakes and transverse spring independent front suspension were <b>fitted.</b> <b>The</b> <b>new</b> car was heavier than the superseded S4C {{and in spite of}} the larger engine, there was no significant increase in performance. A curved back saloon and drophead coupé were offered. About 75 were made, production stopping in 1938.|$|R

25|$|Following the {{dramatic}} 1997 season, Ferrari {{came out with}} an all new car to <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> regulations for 1998, the F300. Although it was a competitive package, the McLaren–Mercedes MP4/13 was most often stronger. Schumacher won six races that season including {{three in a row}} at Canada, France and Great Britain. The Hungarian Grand Prix was won after a tactical master-stroke by Brawn decided to make the car run a 3-stop strategy as opposed to McLaren's 2. Schumacher then went on to lead Irvine home to Ferrari's first 1–2 at Monza since the memorable 1988 race after Enzo Ferrari's death. Schumacher lost the title to McLaren's Mika Häkkinen at Suzuka after he stalled on the front row then suffered a mid-race puncture. Irvine was fourth in the championship with Ferrari second in the constructors' title.|$|E
25|$|The R33 Skyline (Spec 2) {{continued}} the concepts {{introduced in the}} R32. Driver and Passenger airbags became standard in 1996. As a result, pre-1996 models are barred from being imported into various countries for consumer road use as they {{do not meet the}} frontal impact standards. (However, in the U.S., there are Federal Laws regarding safety and emissions that require certain documents to be obtained, certain criteria to be met and adhered to, or 25 years to pass, before the sale of this vehicle becomes legal.) For the RB25DET engine the ignition system was also changed, with the ignition module no longer located on the cam covers and was instead replaced by smart ignition coils (Ignitor built into coil) and ECU. The RB25DET's turbo was also given a nylon compressor wheel to improve response. Throughout the time the R33 was produced there were quite a number of different styled lights and bodykits fitted, the actual body/chassis underwent no changes. Among the cosmetic changes in the spec 2 were, the headlights which tapered down more towards the grill and were fitted with improved reflectors, the grill (which was longer on the Spec 1), the bonnet which had a re-shaped leading edge to <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> lights and front bumper changing shape in the smallest amount to match the lower edge of the new headlights. Later models of the Spec 2 also had the option of having an Active-LSD fitted.|$|E

Vane decided that its Siwash owners, who made long trips in search of fish and furs, had left it for a time, and he pushed on again.|$|R
500|$|While Davidge professed {{himself as}} {{a huge fan of}} O'Donnell's work, he felt the music needed to change to <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> trilogy. [...] "The phrase that kept going around was 'evolution not revolution' of the score," [...] he said. [...] " [...] more electronic, {{slightly}} more beat-driven direction, which is one reason why they came to me. They wanted to flesh out, sonically, a new universe. One that they could expand on in subsequent sequels.” ...|$|E
500|$|Carey {{recorded}} {{yet another}} set of vocals for dance remixes produced by David Morales that were only released on maxi-single in the UK.

[...] The [...] "Fondue for Two" [...] segments were a favorite of reviewers, and were developed from an idea {{by one of the}} show's fans.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} conceived as The Hercules Family, a 16mm musical {{that consisted of}} twelve musical numbers and a story loosely constructed around them. But as the project grew to 35mm and the storyline evolved, Richard Elfman found himself re-shooting many of the original scenes to <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> film. Two sequences from the original 16mm footage were featured on the 2004 DVD release: one of Danny Elfman, as Satan, performing [...] "Minnie the Moocher" [...] (later reshot with visual elements borrowed from the original 16mm sequence and alternate lyrics), and another of Marie-Pascale Elfman, singing [...] "Johnny". The sequence with Elfman as Satan, {{and members of the}} Oingo Boingo as his minions, came from live shows, in which the band would perform Cab Calloway tunes like [...] "St. James Infirmary Blues" [...] in the same costumes.|$|E
500|$|Animals was {{engineered}} by a previous Floyd collaborator, Brian Humphries, and recording {{took place at}} Britannia Row from April to December 1976, continuing into early 1977. [...] "Raving and Drooling" [...] and [...] "You've Got to Be Crazy", two songs previously performed live and considered for Wish You Were Here, reappeared as [...] "Sheep" [...] and [...] "Dogs" [...] respectively. [...] They were reworked to <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> concept, and separated by a Waters-penned composition, [...] "Pigs (Three Different Ones)". [...] With the exception of [...] "Dogs" [...] (co-written by Gilmour) the album's five tracks were written by Waters. The song contains references to Waters' private life; his new romantic interest was Carolyne Anne Christie (married to Rock Scully, manager of the Grateful Dead). [...] Gilmour was distracted by {{the birth of his}} first child, and contributed little else towards the songwriting of the album. [...] Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed as much as they had on previous albums, and Animals was the first Pink Floyd album not to contain a composer's credit for Wright.|$|E
500|$|Time James Poniewozik said [...] "while 'Rumours' had its flaws ... the {{structure}} allowed {{the show to}} serve the stories, rather than feeling like the stories were there to service the songs", and particularly praised how [...] "the songs were integrated into the drama". Semigran and Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone concurred with the latter point, and Futterman wrote that [...] "despite a forced theme premise, the songs of Rumours <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Directions' drama in an organic way." [...] The Atlantic Kevin Fallon called the episode's focus on the Fleetwood Mac songs [...] "a refreshing change of pace". Robert Canning of IGN liked the album concept, but felt it [...] "didn't fully deliver". He gave [...] "Rumours" [...] a [...] "good" [...] rating of 7 out of 10, and wrote, [...] "What made the episode at least mildly entertaining were the comedy bits. Brittany's 'Fondue For Two' segments were fantastic". Most other reviewers were similarly smitten with the [...] "Fondue for Two" [...] segments, including the aforementioned Reiter, Poniewozik, Semigran, and Respers France.|$|E
