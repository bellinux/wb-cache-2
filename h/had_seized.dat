5|$|By 878 the Vikings <b>had</b> <b>seized</b> eastern Mercia {{and nearly}} conquered Wessex, and Alfred {{was reduced to}} being a {{fugitive}} in the Somerset marshes, but he fought back and won the Battle of Edington. This {{was followed by a}} period of peace, and in the late 880s Alfred concluded a treaty with Guthrum, king of the East Anglian Vikings, setting the boundary between Wessex and English Mercia on the one hand, and the Danelaw on the other. A further Viking assault in the mid 890s was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|During {{his service}} in New Orleans, Beauregard became {{dissatisfied}} as a peacetime officer. He informed the U.S. Army Engineer Department late in 1856 {{that he was}} going to join the filibuster with William Walker, who <b>had</b> <b>seized</b> control of Nicaragua; he had offered Beauregard the rank of second-in-command of his army. Senior officers, including general-in-chief Winfield Scott, convinced Beauregard to stay in the United States. He briefly entered politics as a reform candidate for mayor of New Orleans in 1858, where he was promoted by both the Whig and Democratic parties to challenge the Know Nothing party candidate. Beauregard was narrowly defeated.|$|E

5000|$|The entire phrase {{actually}} {{includes both}} {{a positive and}} a negative expression: תפסת מרובה לא תפסת, תפסת מועט תפסת - [...] "If you <b>have</b> <b>seized</b> a lot, you have not seized; if you <b>have</b> <b>seized</b> a little, you have seized." [...] The general meaning is that an over-ambitious claim defeats itself: the intended analogy is to one who grabs more than he can hold.|$|R
5|$|During this period, Albin was {{involved}} in a political controversy regarding succession to an earldom. An alleged papal bull, dated 13 December 1255, had named Bishop Albin as a papal mandatory, along with Robert de Stuteville, with instructions to investigate Alan Durward's claim to the earldom of Mar; however, the bull was denounced as a forgery on 28 March 1257, after Durward's rivals <b>had</b> <b>seized</b> power. During the months preceding this denunciation, Albin was once again out of Scotland; on 4 March 1257 his presence was once again recorded at Durham.|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{attended}} the Second Lateran Council, called by Pope Innocent II. It opened on 4April 1139, and among other matters heard an appeal from the Empress Matilda concerning her {{claim to the}} throne of England. Matilda was the daughter and only surviving legitimate child of King Henry I, but following her father's death in late 1135 her cousin Stephen, the son of Henry's sister, <b>had</b> <b>seized</b> the crown. By 1139 Matilda had gathered supporters and was contesting Stephen's right to the throne.|$|E
5|$|His {{relationship}} with King Edgar is unclear, particularly given {{the uncertainty of}} Thored's paternity, Oslac being banished from England in 975, the year of Edgar's death. Richard Fletcher, who thought Thored {{was the son of}} Gunnar, argued that Thored's raid on Westmorland was caused by resentment derived from losing out on the ealdormanry to Oslac, and that Edgar thereafter confiscated various territories as punishment. The evidence for this is that Newbald, granted by Edgar to Gunnar circa 963, was bought by Archbishop Osketel from the king sometime before 971, implying that the king <b>had</b> <b>seized</b> the land.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, {{the ship}} had an {{aircraft}} catapult installed, along with a crane to handle floatplanes. The following year, the single 8.8cm guns were replaced with a new triaxially stabilized twin-mount; two other twin mounts were added on the rear superstructure. Fire control directors for the anti-aircraft guns were also installed. After emerging from this refit, Königsberg was employed as a gunnery training ship. During the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s, the ship participated in non-intervention patrols, during which she forced Republicans to surrender a German freighter they <b>had</b> <b>seized.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December 1915, Tubantia again made {{news when}} the Overseas News Agency in Berlin {{released}} a report saying that the British <b>had</b> <b>seized</b> all South America mail and parcels from the ship.

5|$|In June, Vittorio Emanuele and {{the rest}} of the 1st Division was {{stationed}} at Rhodes. Over the next two months, the ships cruised in the Aegean to prevent the Turks from attempting to launch their own amphibious operations to retake the islands Italy <b>had</b> <b>seized</b> in May. The 1st Division returned to Italy in late August for repairs and refitting, and were replaced by the battleships of the 2nd Squadron. The 1st Division left port on 14 October, but was recalled later that day, when the Ottomans had agreed to sign a peace treaty to end the war.|$|E

5|$|In September 1945, Hồ {{declared}} independence {{under the}} Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) following {{the withdrawal of}} Imperial Japan, which <b>had</b> <b>seized</b> {{control of the country}} from France during the Second World War. At the time, there was a power vacuum, as both Japan and France had been decimated by the war. There was an outbreak of nationalist fervour in Vietnam; Tảng and Thảo joined the Vanguard Youth, an impromptu independence militia. Tảng was assigned to be the leader of the local unit, but he left the movement soon after, leaving Thảo in command. During this period, Saigon was regularly engulfed in riots.|$|E
5|$|Matthias visited Slavonia and {{dismissed}} the two Bans Nicholas Újlaki and Emeric Zápolya, {{replacing them with}} Jan Vitovec and John Tuz in 1466.

Matthias routed them and had Švehla and his 150 comrades hanged.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, former Ohio Works {{players in}} Zanesville quickly regained their momentum. In March 1907, the new club was {{admitted}} into the Pennsylvania–Ohio–Maryland League, a Division D league. By {{the close of}} the 1907 season, the club <b>had</b> <b>seized</b> the championship of the eight-team P-O-M league. In 1908, Hogan's final season as manager, the team was christened as the Zanesville Infants and joined the Central League.

5|$|Mleh, who <b>had</b> <b>seized</b> Cilicia with Nur ad-Din's help, besieged Bagras, the {{fortress}} of the Knights Templars near Antioch, in early 1170. Bohemond sought assistance from Amalric of Jerusalem, and their united army defeated Mleh, also {{forcing him to}} restore the towns of the Cilician plains to the Byzantine Empire. Bohemond's relationship with Armenian Cilicia remained tense, which prevented him from pursuing an active foreign policy until Mleh was dethroned in 1175.|$|E
5|$|On 18 February 2016, the INR in Warsaw {{announced}} it <b>had</b> <b>seized</b> {{a package of}} original documents that allegedly proved Wałęsa was a paid Communist informant. The documents dated from the period 1970–1976; they were seized from {{the home of a}} recently deceased former interior minister, General Czesław Kiszczak. The documents' authenticity was confirmed by an archival expert, but the prosecutors demanded a handwriting examination. Eventually, the requested examination concluded that the documents were authentic and, hence, Wałęsa had collaborated with the communist secret police.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{week after}} being {{appointed}} by Harrison, Crittenden was dispatched to New York to mediate tensions with Great Britain over {{the sinking of the}} steamboat Caroline by a group of Canadian militia, who were attempting to suppress a rebellion in Canada. In this diplomatic endeavor, Crittenden was acting separately from his official duties as attorney general. He spoke with New York Governor William H. Seward and secured his promise to pardon Alexander McLeod, who <b>had</b> <b>seized</b> and burned the Caroline, if he were convicted of a crime in New York. Ultimately, McLeod was acquitted.|$|E
