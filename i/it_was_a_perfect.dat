The Atmosphere Processor set was not dismantled after filming, and was reused in 1989 as the Axis Chemicals set for Batman (1989).|$|E

25|$|On 6 July, he {{was flying}} one of eight Spitfires that were {{scrambled}} to intercept three Italian Cant bombers and 30 Macchi 202s, Italy's top-line fighter. The eight Spitfires dived straight into the Italians. In seconds, with one burst Beurling had damaged a bomber. Then, suddenly {{he was on the}} tail of a Macchi whose pilot (probably Sergente Maggiore Francesco Pecchiari from 51° Stormo), spotting the Spitfire, plunged into a dive. The Canadian chased his prey for 15,000 ft and, when the Italian pulled up at 5,000, Beurling let go a two-second burst from 300 yards away. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> hit. Although he wasn't aware that he had been fired on, when Beurling inspected his Spitfire back at Takali, he found it riddled with bullets. Undaunted, that evening, just before dusk, he was in the air again in a patrol of four Spitfires. Radar had shown two German JU 88s and 20 Messerschmitts Bf 109Fs, heading towards Malta. After the four Spitfires dived and split up the formation, Beurling followed a fighter trying to escape at low level over the sea. After he laid down a two-second burst the German crashed into the Mediterranean.|$|E

Honolulu Star-Bulletin's Gary C.W. Chun favorably compared Leavin to Gladys Knight's Before Me (2006).

500|$|According to McCarty, Beck {{developed}} the riff after borrowing Page's prototype fuzz box, designed {{for him by}} Roger Mayer. When he played the lick for the band, they felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> fit: [...] "this great sounding riff emerged... I mean Beck just nailed it", rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja recalled. [...] The group returned to Advision on 20 April to complete the song. Beck was able to achieve the sitar-like hook by bending the higher notes on his guitar in an Eastern-sounding scale while also using his own Tone Bender unit to get the distinctive tone. [...] While simultaneously sounding the open D string, he also added a droning quality reminiscent of the sitar's sympathetic strings.|$|E

[...] The band themselves have regarded it as a [...] "huge turning point" [...] in their career, marking {{a change in the}} way they write and record music, as well as view themselves. In his memoir Can I Say, Barker writes: [...] "It {{had a little bit of}} everything: we ventured far enough outside our genre to make ourselves happy, but not so far that we offended our fan base. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> happy medium, and it's the Blink album that Mark, Tom, and I are most proud of." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{the song}} {{was part of the}} set list of the group's tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It where it was {{performed}} during the concert's encore. The singers wore white T-shirts and jeans and during the end of the performance went under cascading water on stage. While reviewing a show by the group in the UK, Adenike Adenitire writing for MTV News found the performance to be somehow casual: [...] "It was like watching three young girls and their friends practicing their moves at a slumber party. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> note of DC harmony to end a night that celebrated both the group and the individuals within it." [...] Barbara Ellen from The Observer felt that the song worked as a [...] "stupendous encore". The song was included on the track listing of the group's live album [...] (2006) chronicling a concert from the tour. Beyoncé performed [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] at the 2007 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo on March 15 as part of a Destiny's Child medley during the concert.|$|E

The band worked on the record for eight days and returned home for a break. A 14-day session, followed the break and then another 10 days in the studio. Gray asserts the breaks in between recording sessions were to [...] "re charge the batteries", and [...] "get a fresh head". As the line-up was complete, the band started to brainstorm names. When a member thought of a name they would write it {{on a piece of}} paper and put it in an amp box outside the studio. Someone wrote [...] "Hellyeah", and the band thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> choice. Paul says it's [...] "very affirmative and full of attitude.

500|$|After {{taking a}} 3–0 lead {{against one of}} the league’s better teams on a Dave Green field goal, the Buccaneers were {{overwhelmed}} by the Baltimore Colts in a disastrous second quarter. A Danny Reece interception of a Bert Jones pass was called back due to a roughing-the-passer penalty, and another was dropped by Richard Wood. Cornerback Mike Washington was thrown out of the game for fighting. Cal Peterson and Lee Roy Selmon went out with knee injuries. Film of the game appeared to indicate that the injury to Selmon was intentional. The Colts followed with 9 points in each of the next two quarters. The Buccaneers finally scored their first two touchdowns of the year, a fumble return by Danny Reece and a 1-yard Charlie Davis run. The Colts set team records with eight sacks, and with 124 penalty yards. They outgained Tampa Bay 458 yards to 89 and 31 first downs to 6. The Buccaneers were only able to complete four passes; wide receiver Lee McGriff was their leading passer with a 39-yard completion. Said McKay afterward, “Field position hurt us badly, dropped passes hurt us badly, no blocking hurt us badly, injuries hurt us badly, and penalties hurt us badly. Otherwise, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> afternoon." ...|$|E

Recognizing that their musical relationship was still intact, the trio began rehearsing with Todd and Nelson, working on material that would become [...] "Dirty Little Thing", but eventually decided against forming a group with them. During a Loaded show at West Hollywood's Viper Room, McKagan introduced Kushner to Slash, who were previously friends in {{junior high and high}} school. Kushner was invited to jam with the group and was soon invited to join with Slash, stating that [...] "Dave brought a cool vibe to what [...] were doing. There was no deliberation; that was it, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> fit." [...] Their former Guns N' Roses band mate Izzy Stradlin also joined them for two weeks, eventually suggesting that [...] "Duff and [...] will sing and [...] will just do a club tour in a van."

Jude Adam of Third Way magazine gave the song a positive review, considering it as [...] "quirky, sunny, and sweet in perfect measures." [...] Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club considered the song as [...] "actually catchy". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that Madonna divulges in the song that not everyone who wants {{to make it in the}} movies succeeds. Jessica Winter from The Village Voice commented that in the song, [...] "Madonna channels a generic teen-pop chanteuse". Dennis Ferrera from Out, while interviewing Madonna for her 2005 album Confessions on a Dance Floor, described the song as a [...] "killer single". Another positive review by J. J.
