30|$|Residential {{electricity}} pricing in most {{provinces of}} China is mainly applied via TOU pricing schemes combined with TP pricing options [26, 27]. In areas where electricity monopolies exist, electricity companies determine residential electricity pricing strategies [28, 29], and residents have {{no opportunity to}} select electricity retailers. It is thus not possible for such residents to participate in DSM programs apart from TOU pricing and TP offered by the electricity monopolies. These programs are not always effective. As TOU pricing settings and corresponding time periods are unified, some customers cannot avoid incurring extra consumption costs [30]. TP constrains consumption over a long time period. However, TP is not advantageous when several independent residents are sharing a single <b>electricity</b> <b>account</b> [31]. A customer account shared with several residents may incur additional tariffs because it may need to pay more consumption tariffs and higher electricity prices [32]. Furthermore, in fixed price areas, residential customers cannot find suitable DSM programs that offer TOU and TP options [33, 34].|$|E

Also the existing international standards requiring complete and representative LCI dataas regards the energy sector. For instance, ISO 14040 – 44 (ISO 2006 a, b) states that “When determining the elementary flows associated with production, the actual production mix should be used whenever possible, in order to reflect {{the various types of}} resources that are consumed… …for the production and delivery of <b>electricity,</b> <b>account</b> shall be taken of the electricity mix, the efficiencies of fuel combustion, conversion, transmission and distribution losses”. LCI data related to energy sectors (i.e. power and fuels), as well as some secondary data (e.g. raw material commodities, end-of-life scenarios) are considered to be highly relevant to LCA results, in terms of environmental impacts and resource consumption (De Smet and Stalmans 1996; Treyer and Bauer 2013). The quality, consistency and representativeness of these data are therefore crucial (Treyer and Bauer 2013).|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, biomass such as wood {{has been}} used for cooking and heating purposes. The oil crises of the 1970 s, however, {{prompted}} interest in biomass to produce liquid biofuels and replace fossil-based transport fuels. Subsequent falls in oil prices evaporated much of the incentive and stalled the momentum to expand biofuel production in most countries, but recent years have seen a resurgence of interest, this time prompted by energy supply security, oil price volatility and the new driver: climate change mitigation. As a result, biofuel programmes have proliferated around the world, driven by mandates, targets and subsidies, whilst investment in the development of advanced biofuel technologies has racked up. And, as before, biofuels as an alternative to fossil-based transport fuel, gaseous or liquid, has been emphasized. The 2003 EU Biofuels Directive, for example, targets a 5. 75 % share of biofuels in transport energy by 2010 and 10 % by 2020. However, biofuels {{can also be used to}} efficiently produce both heat and power in decentralized production systems based on combined heat and power (CHP) engines.

40|$|Global warming {{has become}} a “hot topic ” {{over the past few}} years, {{entering}} into politics, the media, and classrooms around the world. Many people have seen Al Gore’s documentary, “An Inconvenient Truth, ” which shows that the melting of the Greenland ice sheet could shut down the thermohaline circulation in the Atlantic Ocean, effectively causing an ice age in Europe {{while the rest of the}} planet continues to get hotter. Not only would the onset of an ice age destroy much of the plant and animal life, it would also cause an economic loss of over 40 % of Europe’s GDP (Cline, 2004). Greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, are believed to be the main cause of global warming. Burning natural gas, fuel oil, coal, and propane, as well as using <b>electricity,</b> <b>account</b> for 21 % of total carbon dioxide emissions. There have been and still are many attempts to dampen the effects of carbon dioxide emissions, such as the gas-guzzler tax and tax credits for conservation. The gas-guzzler tax applies to the sales of vehicles with official EPA-estimated gas mileage below 22. 5 miles per gallon based on a 55 %/ 45 % highway/city usage.

40|$|Mobile Based Remote Meter Reading and Billing System was {{the title}} of the project chosen to develop for Ceylon Electricity Board in my partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirement of the degree of M. sc in Information Technology of the university of Moratuwa. Ceylon Electricity Board is currently having a computerized billing system. However, it does not have a feature or facility of updating consumer information system from a remote location i. e. from consumer site itself. Due to this reason electricity consumer information system does not reflect the current status of his/her <b>electricity</b> <b>account.</b> Normally it takes approximately 3 – 4 weeks to update the consumer info system with the current electricity meter reading/s after obtaining them from a consumer sites. This {{is one of the major}} drawbacks of the existing computerized electricity billing system. Also current system does not facilitate consumers to view their billing status through organization's website and also there is no facility to make bill payments through the web site. Finally, existing system does not cater for effective Management Information System and also efficient monitoring of overdue accounts. Because of this, Ceylon Electricity Board is unable to disconnect supply of default consumers at the right time. Therefore, under this project, updating of Consumer electricity readings from a remote location by using the mobile technology was proposed. After gathering the Meter Readings by the Bill man he/she can feed or transmit the reading data to the server using a device like mobile phone. This can be done immediately at the consumer site after obtaining the reading or at a later time before 16. 00 Hrs. of the day. By this manner, whole data entry process involve in this activity can be eliminated. At the end of the day, after necessary validations, consumer information system can be updated using the days readings transmitted by all meter readers/bill men to the server. In addition, e-commerce site is developed to facilitate consumer needs such as bill inquiry, making payments etc. Since the system has the facility of sending e-mail and SMS alerts for default consumers, handling of overdue consumers should become easy and efficient. By this way CEB should be able to increase their revenue...|$|E
40|$|Most utility's and {{electricity}} resellers stimulate {{changes in their}} load shape through various demand side management activities. The most common way of altering their load shape is through the implementation of different tariff structures. The thesis investigates the effect of combining hot water load control with heating ventilation and air-conditioning load control to reduce the electricity costs due to a demand tariff that {{is a direct result}} of demand side management. The entire study is focused on the demand tariff of the University of Pretoria. Although the study was done on the University of Pretoria the methods developed are universal and can be implemented in any situation where hot water load control and heating ventilation and air-conditioning load control are to be combined. The study presents a detailed literature study on the current developments in the field of hot water and heating ventilation and air-conditioning load control. No current work could be found in which the two control methods are combined. Models were developed for controlling the electricity load and for determining the savings. The heating ventilation and air-conditioning load's and the hot water load's uncontrolled load models respectively had a mean absolute percentage errors of 3. 83 % and 3. 2 %. The forecasting method used to determine the available energy for pre-cooling and the start time of shedding had a mean absolute error of 3. 2 %. A case study of the University of Pretoria was done. The effect of using only hot water load control is presented. The case study was expanded to include structural thermal energy storage and then water thermal energy storage. This expansion was done using the HV AC system in combination with the hot water load control system. With an only 10. 3 % contribution to the university's maximum demand, the hot water load control reduced the university's <b>electricity</b> <b>account</b> (energy + demand) by 5. 44 %. The heating ventilation and air conditioning load contribute to 6 % of the university's maximum demand. With the structural thermal energy storage using the heating ventilation and air conditioning system, the savings increased to 6. 12 %. With the addition of a 750 m 3 water thermal energy storage tank to the heating ventilation and air-conditioning system, the savings increased to 7. 14 %.

40|$|Faculty of Humanities School of Humanities and Social Sciences 0200487 m peter. mcinnes@health. gov. zaThis {{dissertation}} {{looks at}} the attitudes, actions and opinions towards law, rights and political mobilisation, and in particular South Africa’s Bill of Rights, of {{a small band of}} activists associated with the Soweto Electricity Crisis Committee (SECC). It provides a snapshot of attitudes towards the Bill of Rights prevalent at the birth of a small organisation, which since 2000 has been active and at times successful in guaranteeing affordable electricity in South Africa’s largest township - Soweto. The SECC emerged as a real force in Johannesburg’s political life {{in the first half of}} 2001 as a result of the disconnection of up to 20, 000 households per month by the state owned electricity utility, ESKOM. In response to these cut-offs Sowetans required urgent and appropriate forms of political action that would both provide immediate relief in terms of reconnecting disconnected households to the grid, wiping off unpayable <b>electricity</b> <b>account</b> arrears and, over the longer term, mitigating or transforming the policies that led to the cut-offs. This study explores to what extent the Bill of Rights enhanced grass roots political mobilisation. The study describes the potential mechanism through which rights discourse promotes community mobilization and provide some preliminary comments on the appropriateness of legal mobilization for political ends. This focus on electricity enabled understanding of how a community based organisation strategised social mobilisation when a particular demand, in this case an essential service - electricity - is not explicitly included in the South African Bill of Rights. Specifically it allowed the study of strategies adopted to prosecute similar demands surrounding access to water, which was explicitly included in the Constitution. In this case the SECC strategy was to deliberately obscure the boundaries between the two services. Rights talk was adopted by the SECC to serve political ends. The need of Sowetans for reliable, consistent and affordable supplies of electricity was transformed and demanded as of right by the SECC. Such a characterisation had obvious advantages to the SECC activists trying to build a movement that could challenge Eskom’s and the municipal government’s credit control policies. Rights talk provided a catalyst to engage interest in the campaign. On attracting an audience by ‘rights talk’ the allegation that service disconnection denied ‘fundamental human rights’ tapped into already existing feelings of hurt and humiliation. Rights talk legitimated peoples private feelings of pain and humiliation. The evolving sense of outrage as a result of this denial was then directed (hopefully) towards involvement in protests and meetings. The themes present in the writings of critical legal theorists on rights are explored. This study found that the key tenets of critical legal theory’s critique of rights such as the malleability and indeterminacy of legal discourse to suit your own ends; the tilt within the legal system to already powerful interests within South African society; and the risks of constitutional litigation to the democratic character of the struggle were all present in the minds of activists. Yet ultimately legal strategies were of ongoing interest to SECC activists because of the undeniable potential leverage they provided to promote social mobilisation and allow for real changes in harmful government policies through the assistance of the courts. These potential uses outweighed the identified attendant risks of a constitutional litigation strategy. This study concludes that rights can form an important component of the progressive activists arsenal of weapons against liberal capitalism. This is both understandable in a short-term strategic sense (as implied above in the SECC’s use of rights) as well as a more complex longer-term project of building a better society...|$|E
