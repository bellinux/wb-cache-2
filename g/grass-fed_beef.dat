25|$|At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Center for Integrated Agricultural System's Food and Farm {{project is}} working with the region's sustainable-agriculture farmers, processors, distributors, chefs, {{planning}} commissions, and others to define the culinary identity of the region and direct the development of agrotourism. For instance, 75% of the raw-milk artisan cheese produced in Wisconsin is made in the Driftless region. This cheese is made from milk produced by cows that graze on pastures. The region is home to Organic Valley, the nation's largest organic dairy cooperative. Generally, organic dairy production fits best with a grass-based milk production system. In addition to winegrape production and wine-making, the region also is known for apple production, and a number of hard cider makers are about to hit the market with product. The region is historically known for <b>grass-fed</b> <b>beef,</b> and has great potential to market forest botanicals - especially mushrooms - to the 21 million people in the region, including the relatively nearby Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, and Milwaukee markets.|$|E

An animal is considered grass-fed, according to the USDA Grass Fed Marketing Claim Standards, when grass and forage are the “feed source consumed for the lifetime of the ruminant animal, with the exception of milk consumed prior to weaning. Animals cannot be fed grain or grain by-products and must have continuous access to pasture during the growing season. Hay, haylage, baleage, silage, crop residue without grain, and other roughage sources may also be included as acceptable feed sources.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the quality characteristics in a comparative manner of <b>grass-fed</b> and grain-fed <b>beef.</b> Thirty two commercially bred beef steers were used. These steers were assigned to one of four treatments; grain-fed, grass/grain-fed, grass-fed and irrigated. These treatments were each reflective of the ration that would be provided to the animal. Individual animal weights were recorded every 28 days throughout the portion of the study. The grain-fed animals realized the highest (P 0. 05) was shown between wet and dry aging with regard to percent cutout. Sensory evaluation was also conducted based upon the attributes of juiciness, tenderness and flavor intensity. For all three attributes grain-fed beef was favored (P 0. 05). Carcass soft tissue chemical composition (lipid, protein and moisture) was also evaluated for the treatments. Grain-fed beef was shown to be highest (P< 0. 05) for overall percent lipid and lowest for percent moisture and protein.

40|$|To {{determine}} US {{consumer acceptance}} {{and value of}} beef from various countries, 24 taste panels of consumers (n = 273 consumers) were conducted in Denver and Chicago. Two pairs of strip steaks were evaluated for flavor, juiciness, tenderness, and overall acceptability on eight-point hedonic scales. One pair consisted of an Australian grass-fed strip steak and a domestic strip steak, whereas the other pair included Canadian and domestic strip steaks. The pairs were matched to similar Warner-Bratzler shear values and marbling scores to decrease variation associated with tenderness and juiciness. A variation of the Vickery auction was used to obtain silent, sealed bids on steaks (0. 45 kg) from the same strip loins sampled in the taste panel. Consumers gave higher (P < 0. 001) scores for flavor, juiciness, tenderness, and overall acceptability for domestic steaks compared with Australian grass-fed steaks. Domestic steaks averaged $ 3. 68 / 0. 45 kg, whereas consumers placed an average value of $ 2. 48 / 0. 45 kg on Australian grass-fed steaks (P < 0. 001). Consumers rated Canadian steaks numerically lower for juiciness (P = 0. 09) and lower (P < 0. 005) for flavor, tenderness, and overall acceptability than domestic samples. Consumers placed an average value of $ 3. 95 / 0. 45 kg for domestic steaks and $ 3. 57 / 0. 45 kg for Canadian steaks (P < 0. 01). Consumers (19. 0 %) who preferred Australian grass-fed steaks over domestic steaks paid $ 1. 38 / 0. 45 kg more (P < 0. 001), whereas consumers (29. 3 %) who favored the Canadian steaks over the domestic steaks paid $ 1. 37 / 0. 45 kg more (P < 0. 001) for the Canadian steaks.
