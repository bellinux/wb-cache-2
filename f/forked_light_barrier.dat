As outlined below, such a device could be used to project a classical linear <b>light</b> <b>barrier,</b> but could equally be used to produce curved perimeters and/or even full-volume <b>light</b> <b>barriers.</b> Target applications of this technology are security and surveillance, e. g. for access, tampering or theft control, or vehicle interior presence detection...|$|R
40|$|When {{light comes}} {{into contact with}} milk, the milk will start to {{deteriorate}} and taste bad due to production of off-flavour compounds. Aseptic milk carton packages stored at ambient temperature usually have a layer of aluminium foil, which acts as a <b>barrier</b> for incoming <b>light,</b> water, oxygen and other gases. If the aluminium would not be present the <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> would mainly consist of the paperboard. In order to develop a milk package without aluminium foil for ambient storage, {{it is important to}} obtain knowledge of <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> properties of paperboard and plastic caps. When measuring the <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> in the material two spectrophotometers were used. The spectrophotometers measured the fraction of light that was able to penetrate a sample. The investigation of paperboards for 1 litre packages showed that they had protection against light of wavelengths that induced off flavour reactions with Riboflavin (220 - 375, 410 - 475 nm). But the transmission for light within the range 650 - 700 nm was above 0. 1 %. Those wavelengths induce off flavour reactions with porphyrins and chlorins. Different layers in the paperboard contribute differently to the total <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> of the paperboard. Exposing a paperboard to sunlight deteriorates its <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> in the long run, while printing on paperboard improves its <b>light</b> <b>barrier.</b> The plastic caps on packages are a fraction of the total package in term of area. But the <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> of the total package could be lacking due to the plastic caps which is why they have been investigated. Different colouring pigments give different <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> properties in the cap...|$|R

30|$|In Fig. 3 (a), two {{orthogonal}} polarizers {{are placed}} in front of two projectors with the same parameters and then two EIAs with orthogonal polarization states are projected onto the projection screen by the corresponding projectors. The polarization direction of the EIA is {{the same as that of}} the polarizer in front of the projectors. The projection screen is a rear projection screen which is able to maintain the light polarization characteristics. In addition, by adding a full <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> between different polarizers before the lenslet array, we can increase the viewing angle further. The size of each <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> is the same as that of each lenslet. The width of each EI is 4 times that of conventional integral imaging system, and its height remains unchanged. The polarizers and <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> {{are placed in}} close proximity to the lenslet array and the polarization directions of adjacent polarizers are orthogonal. The light ray of the EIA is filtered through polarizers array and <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> array and then reaches the lenslets array. The 3 D reconstructed image can be obtained by the observer.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} wide-viewing integral {{imaging system}} is established {{by using the}} lenslet array coupling with the polarizers, <b>light</b> <b>barriers,</b> and enlarged elemental images array.

In the projection-type integral imaging system, two orthogonal elemental images arrays (EIA) are projected onto the projection screen simultaneously by the corresponding projectors. In LCD integral imaging system, two orthogonal EIAs are displayed by use of an LCD screen which can switch the polarization direction of the EIA by time-multiplexed technology within the time constant of the eyes’ response time.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} improve the viewing angle of the {{integral}} imaging system, this paper presents a method of placing the polarizers and <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> array {{in front of the}} lenslet array. By jointly controlling LCD/projection screen, the lenslet array, the polarizer, and <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> array, different polarized light ray can pass through corresponding lenslets. The proposed method can increase the size of the elemental images (EI), eliminate the crosstalk phenomenon of the light through the adjacent lenslets, and thus improve the viewing angle of the 3 D display system.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} viewing angle {{enhancement}} method {{for both the}} LCD and projection-type 3 D integral imaging system. The proposed integral imaging system is established by using the lenslet array coupling with the polarizer array, <b>light</b> <b>barrier,</b> and the enlarged EIs. In projection-type integral imaging system, two orthogonal EIA are projected onto the projection screen simultaneously by the corresponding projectors. In LCD integral imaging system, two orthogonal EIA are displayed {{by the use of}} a LCD screen which can switch the polarization direction of the display images by time-multiplexed technology within the time constant of the eyes’ response time. The increment of viewing angle can be determined by the number of <b>light</b> <b>barriers,</b> the more the <b>light</b> <b>barriers,</b> the lager the viewing angle. The size of each elemental image can be enlarged as any positive integer multiples. Thus, the viewing angle of the integral imaging system can be improved dramatically by the improvement of the size of each elemental image according to the integral imaging principles.|$|R

The numbers of fish that had passed under or were swimming in the lighted area of the flume were considered as guidance failures. The data were studied by the analysis of variance technique.

The system shall produce up to 80 Hz, 80 mm wavelength running surface wave with amplitudes from 50 to 1000 μm. To ensure both, waveform and amplitude, the control algorithm requires real time amplitude measurements of all 20 actuators. Techniques are described to extend the limited measurement range of analog <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> and to reduce impact of mechanical disturbances on the measurement process by placement and compensation. Also a small bar permanent magnet together with Hall sensors to track position are employed and a method for reducing impact of the strong magnetic stray fields affecting Hall sensors in this actuator system is developed...|$|R
30|$|It {{can be seen}} in Fig. 6 {{that the}} viewing angle of the {{integral}} imaging system based on polarizers and <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> array has been significantly improved. By comparing the different view images horizontally, different parallax information can be obtained. In the range of ± 33 °, you can get the correct reconstructed image of the whole scene. The proposed method is about approximately 4 times the viewing angle of the conventional integral imaging. The different wide-viewing integral three-dimensional imaging methods proposed by Refs. [9, 10] can improve the field angle to a certain extent, but cannot more than 2 times the original viewing angle. In both modes of our manuscript, the viewing angle can be enlarged more than 2 times which is the main difference between the proposed system and the previous methods. The increment of viewing angle can be determined by the number of <b>light</b> <b>barriers,</b> the more the <b>light</b> <b>barrier,</b> the lager the viewing angle. When one light baffles array is used, the field angle will be enlarged 4 times as conventional method. The size of each elemental image can be enlarged as any positive integer multiples as the pitch of the lenslet. Thus, the viewing angle of the integral imaging system can be improved dramatically by the improvement of the size of each elemental image according to the integral imaging principles.|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the antioxidant properties (FRAP ferric-reducing ability and ABTS radical-scavenging capacity) {{as well as the}} <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> properties of gelatin-based edible films containing oregano or rosemary aqueous extracts. For comparative purposes both bovine-hide and tuna-skin gelatins were studied. The oregano and rosemary extracts were first characterised by both their total phenolic content and antioxidant activity, with the oregano extract showing the higher values. HPLC and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed qualitative differences between extracts although rosmarinic acid was the most abundant phenolic compound in both. After determining the total quantities of phenolics on films, the polyphenol-protein interaction was found to be more extensive when tuna-skin gelatin was employed. However, this did not clearly affect the antioxidant properties of the films, although it could affect the phenol diffusion from film to food. The <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> properties were improved by the addition of oregano or rosemary extracts, irrespective of the type of gelatin employed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|A {{total of}} 12 groups each {{containing}} 100 year plus steelhead trout, or chinook or silver salmon were tested under four light conditions in an experimental flume with velocities of 3. 0 fps for 45 minutes, and 4. 0 fps {{for the next}} 15 minutes. The time at which each fish was impinged on the 1 / 2 inch wire mesh retaining screen at the downstream end of the flume was recorded. The four lighting conditions were: (a) 20 degree angled <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> across {{both sides of the}} flume, (b) 90 degree blocking <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> across both sides of the flume, (c) all light, and (4) all dark. Steelheads were least and chinooks most dependent upon the light cues to avoid impingement. The 90 degree <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> and overall <b>light</b> were about equally effective in keeping chinooks and silvers off the screen. The 20 degree angled barrier was successful in deflecting a significant proportion of all three species into the dark channel after they were fatigued, where they were eventually impinged. The total swimming time before impingement was shortest in the dark for the chinooks and silvers, and least with the 90 degree barrier for the steelheads. The experimental condition productive of the longest swimming time for the chinooks and silvers was the 90 degree <b>barrier</b> and all <b>light</b> (no significant difference between them) and all dark for the steelheads (not significantly different from all light). On the basis of the avoiding response to the angled barrier, the steelhead were the most sensitive to light stimuli...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose to}} “boost ” {{the speed of}} {{communication}} and computation by immersing the computing environment into a medium whose index of refraction is smaller than one, thereby trespassing the speed-oflight barrier. The Church-Turing and the Cook-Karp theses, as well as other, more general limits on computation, are under permanent “scrutiny ” (cf., e. g., Ref. [1, p 11] or Ref.

Some recent issues which have been raised comprise Zeno-squeezed accelerated time scales [3 – 7] enabling the construction of “infinity machines ” capable of hypercomputation [8 – 10], counterfactual computation [11] and cryptography [12] based on quantum counterfactuals [13, 14], {{as well as the}} dissipation limits to computation [15].

40|$|CETEA- ITAL Abstract: The use of {{transparent}} packages {{has great}} marketing appeal since they allow consumers {{to actually see}} the product they wish to buy. However, the light that passes through the packaging material may catalyze oxidation reactions in photosensitive products and reduce their shelf life. The use of UV absorbers in packages for personal care products is an increasing tendency in the market due to growing consumer preference for more natural, non-additive products. UV absorbers prevent photo-degradation of the product {{as a result of}} the UV <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> properties of the packaging, which protect the product against UV rays in the wavelength range of 200 - 380 nm. Although a number of studies indicate the need for the use of UV absorbers, they do not mention any technical reference data that could be used as quality parameters for packaging systems. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of UV absorbers as <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> in plastic packages of personal care products in order to generate technical data required to establish specifications for these packaging systems...|$|R
