5|$|Jackson was a WNBA All Star {{again in}} 2002, and {{played in the}} All Star Game. She {{averaged}} 17.2 points per game. She was the team's captain, the youngest in the WNBA at the time. During one game which was attended by 11,000 fans, the fans loudly chanted her name. In 2002, Carrie Graf, who had been an assistant coach on the Australian national team from when Jackson for played for it, changed coaching positions in the WNBA from Phoenix to Seattle specifically to make Jackson <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> playing for the team. She was estimated to have earned $200,000 {{to play for the}} Storm in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Amy Schalet, {{author of}} Not Under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex {{discusses}} {{in her book}} how the practices of Dutch parents strengthen their bonds with their children. Teenagers <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> about their sexuality and engage in discussion with their parents about it. A majority of Dutch parents feel comfortable allowing their teenagers to have their significant other spend the night.|$|E
25|$|If {{the patient}} can {{be led to}} accept one suggestion, they will more readily accept others. With {{resistant}} patients, it becomes necessary to find a suggestion that they can accept. Resistance is always important, and should always be respected, so if the resistance itself is encouraged, the patient is made to <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable,</b> {{because they know that}} they are allowed to respond however they wish.|$|E

25|$|Each {{university}} has a Pro Day, {{during which the}} NCAA allows NFL scouts to visit the school and watch players participate in NFL Combine events together. (Some smaller universities join with nearby schools.) Essentially job fairs for prospective NFL players, Pro Days are held under the belief that players <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> at their own campus than they do at the Combine, which in turn leads to better performances. College teams which produce a large quantity of NFL prospects generally generate huge interest from scouts and coaches at their Pro Days.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the {{majority}} of Franco-Ontarians are, out of necessity, functionally or fluently bilingual in English, a fact that encourages borrowing, as does {{the fact that the}} English language has a greater prestige in the province from its being a majority language. Franco-Ontarian communities with a small francophone population tend to have more English-influenced French, and some younger speakers there may <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> using English than French. On the other hand, the French spoken in French-dominant Ontarian communities (such as Hearst and Hawkesbury), or in those communities near the Quebec border (such as Ottawa), is virtually indistinguishable from Quebec French.|$|E
25|$|Eilis {{lives at}} a Brooklyn {{boarding}} {{house where she}} dines each night with the landlady and her fellow residents, all young women. She has {{a job at a}} department store but is shy and quiet when interacting with customers, garnering some criticism from Miss Fortini, her supervisor. Her letters from her sister make her homesick. She is visited by Father Flood, and he tries to help by enrolling her in bookkeeping classes. At a dance she meets Tony Fiorello, who becomes her boyfriend. She begins to <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> in New York, and she and Tony become more and more involved romantically.|$|E

25|$|Following the Conservatives' {{defeat in}} the election, he agreed {{to return to the}} front bench as Transport Spokesman. In July 1965, he stood in the first-ever party {{leadership}} election but came a distant third to Edward Heath, obtaining only 15 votes, just below the result Hugh Fraser would gain in the 1975 contest. Heath appointed him Shadow Secretary of State for Defence. Powell said that he had “left his visiting card”, i.e. demonstrated himself to be a potential future leader, but the immediate effect was to demonstrate his limited support in the Parliamentary Party, enabling Heath to <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> calling his bluff.|$|E
25|$|Mullally's {{performance}} was well received, {{which made the}} Parks and Recreation producers <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> about using celebrity guest actors in later episodes. Other such celebrity guests included: Blake Anderson, Fred Armisen, Will Arnett, Kristen Bell, H. Jon Benjamin, Matt Besser, Chris Bosh, Louis C.K., The Decemberists, Sam Elliott, Will Forte, Ginuwine, Michael Gross, Jon Hamm, Nick Kroll, John Larroquette, Andrew Luck, Letters to Cleo, Natalie Morales, Parker Posey, Andy Samberg, Roy Hibbert, Detlef Schrempf, Justin Theroux, Wilco, Henry Winkler, and Yo La Tengo. Paul Rudd appeared in several season four episodes as Bobby Newport, Leslie's opponent in the City Council race, and returned for two episodes in the final season.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} make {{patients}} <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable,</b> the patient care providers make themselves more approachable, therefore more readily open to multiple levels of personal connections. Such personal connections {{have the ability to}} uplift patients’ spirits and secure confidentiality. Utilization of the quality of time spent with the patient proves to be beneficial. By being available for a proper amount of time, patients open up and disclose personal stories, which enable psychiatric/mental health nurses to understand the meaning behind each story. The outcome results in nurses making every effort to attaining a non-biased point of view. A combination of being there and being available allows empirical connections to quell any negative feelings within patients.|$|E

The producers travel South to cast the role, so Cindy Lou follows them there, looking up her Aunt Lily Lou and Uncle Jefferson Davis Bethany and scheming to show the New Yorkers what she can do.|$|R
25|$|The {{conventions}} {{for professional}} artists working in private {{are much less}} defined, especially as the models are often friends or family. However, artists who regularly hire strangers tend to observe art school standards {{in order to make}} models <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable,</b> and to avoid possible legal issues. Professional artists often hire the same models on a regular basis. When a comfortable working relationship is established, many artists relax their standards and models do the same. This may be something as simple as not undressing in another room, or not wearing a robe during breaks. In addition, silence is no longer necessary if the artist is comfortable working and conversing with the model. A more collegial relationship may develop where artist and model feel that they are collaborating. However, in a private studio environment, with an artist on a deadline or with commission guidelines, stricter work standards may apply regarding punctuality and holding longer, more demanding poses, but also require higher rates of pay.|$|E
25|$|Cooking with Dogs {{creator and}} {{producer}} conceived {{of the idea}} for the show upon his return to Tokyo from Los Angeles, where he had graduated from film school and worked in film and television. Interested in continuing in the industry, but unable to find success on his own and lacking a significant budget, the producer approached Chef (whose identity is also undisclosed for privacy reasons) {{with the idea of a}} cooking show. Chef was known to the producer as a good cook, and agreed to the show concept: she would cook one dish while her toy poodle Francis would be dubbed to narrate. Francis, who lives with Chef, was included to make Chef <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> and at ease on camera, as she had no background with television. Additionally, the producer felt that including a cute dog would make the series stand out to viewers. The decision for Francis to narrate in Japanese-accented English was due to the producer's desire to promote Japanese culture through English-accessible content and widen the show's appeal. The show's producer does the voice acting for Francis.|$|E

Charlotte later discovers she is {{pregnant}} with twins {{and turns to}} Flynn for support, much to Jude's anger as he feels that another one of his girlfriends <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> talking to Flynn. Jude then explains that his ex-girlfriend Shauna Bradley (Kylie Watson) had made a pass at Flynn several months earlier. Charlotte assures Jude she will never let him and down and he moves in with her at Sally's.|$|R

It should also be mentioned that he has worked with the best skilled cinematographers and a bunch of creative directors throughout his career. He has also forayed into Ad films with Pepsi, Amruthanjan, Fair and Lovely etc.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, Turney {{began to}} redefine Victoria's Secret catalog from [...] "breasts—spilling {{over the tops}} of black, purple and reptile-print underthings" [...] to one that would appeal to an [...] "upscale {{customer}} who now <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> buying La Perla or Wolford lingerie."; [...] "dimming the hooker looks" [...] such as [...] "tight jeans and stilettos"; and moving from [...] "a substitute for Playboy in some dorm rooms," [...] to something closer to a Vogue lifestyle layout, where lingerie, sleepwear, clothes and cosmetics appear throughout the catalog.|$|R
500|$|Eisenberg {{struggled}} {{to fit in}} at school due to an anxiety disorder, and began acting in plays at an early age. When he was 7, he starred as Oliver Twist in a children's theater production of the musical Oliver!, and {{by the age of}} 12 he was an understudy in the 1996 Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams' Summer and Smoke. At 13, he understudied the role of Young Scrooge in a musical version of A Christmas Carol starring Tony Randall. Eisenberg made his first professional role in Arje Shaw's off-Broadway play, The Gathering, at the age of 16. He stated, [...] "When playing a role, I would <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable,</b> as you're given a prescribed way of behaving." ...|$|E
500|$|Only a {{small number}} of crew members were {{employed}} to maintain the sense of intimacy that Doremus wanted on set. At its largest, the crew consisted of around 20 people, while some scenes were shot with as few as three crew members, such as a scene on a Santa Monica beach where only Doremus, Guleserian and [...] "a sound guy" [...] were present in addition to the actors. Doremus would often ask members of the crew to leave when filming intimate scenes between Jones and Yelchin so that the two actors would <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable.</b> These scenes would be shot in improvised takes of up to 30 minutes in length, with Doremus providing only occasional direction. The film's dialogue was almost entirely improvised by the actors, whose lines Doremus believed would come about [...] "by virtue of being fully involved in the character and the moment".|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} The Washington Post {{released}} their report, Julia Pierson, {{who took over}} {{as director of the}} Secret Service from Sullivan in March 2013, testified at a United States House of Representatives hearing regarding security breaches at the White House. Pierson was criticised by Committee Chairman Darrell Issa regarding several security breaches. Issa stated, [...] "The fact is, the system broke down... when Oscar Ortega-Hernandez successfully shot at the White House on November 2011." [...] Upon hearing that an agent was unwilling to doubt her superior's assertion, Representative Elijah Cummings stated to Pierson that it was [...] "very disturbing to know that Secret Service agents in the most protective agency in the world <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable...</b> coming to members of this committee and telling things than coming to you and members in the agency." [...] Pierson acknowledged that the incident was [...] "extremely" [...] troubling. As a result of the 2011 shooting and other controversies, Pierson resigned from her position on October 1, 2014.|$|E
50|$|Fantomina's {{economic}} and social standing is portrayed in an interesting light, because her privilege {{seems to be more}} of a constraint on her than it is a benefit. This critiques the standards placed on women especially, coming from an elite background. She <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> coming forward with her sexuality in disguise at a brothel than she would at a party with her fellow middle-class men and women. Lowering her class, where there is less concern over a high-society marriage opportunity, and virginity is less of a critical concern, lots her the freedom she wants.|$|R

500|$|The {{second season}} also {{included}} several prominent guest appearances, something that distinguished Parks and Recreation from Greg Daniels' other comedy series, The Office. Schur said high-profile guests on The Office {{would be too}} distracting because most episodes are confined to one setting, while he said Parks and Recreation was [...] "a little bit more bright and colorful than The Office". Megan Mullally, the real-life wife of Nick Offerman, appeared as Ron's ex-wife Tammy in the episode [...] "Ron and Tammy". Schur said Mullally's appearance was well received and not overly distracting to viewers, which made the Parks and Recreation producers <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> about using future guest actors. Stand-up comedian Louis C.K. appeared in several episodes as Dave Sanderson, a Pawnee police officer and romantic interest to Leslie Knope. Although typically known for his raunchy and caustic comedy style, Louis C.K. adopted a far more deadpan {{sense of humor and}} technical tone of voice for Sanderson.|$|E
500|$|While {{preparing}} for the studio sessions, the band focused on their vocal interplay by practicing barbershop quartet-style songs, which helped both Cuomo and Sharp <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> collaborating during rehearsals. Sharp, who had never sung before joining Weezer, developed his falsetto backing vocal: [...] "I had to sing an octave higher than Rivers. After a lot of practice, I started to get it down." [...] Fifteen songs were rehearsed for the album pre-production sessions in New York {{in preparation for the}} Electric Lady Studios recording sessions. Four songs from this rehearsal would not be attempted for the album: [...] "Lullaby for Wayne", [...] "I Swear It's True", [...] "Getting Up and Leaving", and a reprise version of [...] "In The Garage". The other song, an ode to two women who ran the Weezer fanclub called [...] "Mykel & Carli", was attempted during the Electric Lady sessions, but was also abandoned (this recording would later be released as a digital bonus track on the 2010 Death to False Metal album). A later re-recording of [...] "Mykel & Carli" [...] would be featured as a B-side on the [...] "Undone - The Sweater Song" [...] single.|$|E

The song {{was written in}} 2009 and registered on Broadcast Music Incorporated under the legal title [...] "I I I Wanna Go O O". On February 22, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account a link to a 29-second clip of the song, while calling Martin [...] "amazing". In an interview with Rolling Stone, Spears stated that the song's signature whistle gets her [...] "every time [...] hears it", adding that Martin's melodies are [...] "Incredible... Who {{would have thought of}} that? There is nobody I <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> collaborating with in the studio." [...] Kotecha told Digital Spy in May 2011 that the song was likely a contender for third single due to positive reaction. On May 11, 2011, a poll was launched on Britney.com in which fans could choose the third single of the album. Two days later, [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] was officially announced as the third single from Femme Fatale by Jive Records through a press release after winning the poll. [...] The cover art was revealed on June 6, 2011, and featured Spears on set of the music video, wearing colored hair extensions and a top with a skeletal Mickey Mouse.|$|E

My waist is only 18 inches, and <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> than when I was squeezed in {{only a couple of}} inches. In fact, I think I enjoy the feeling of tightness. I know when I take off my stays to wash, I don't feel comfortable till I get them on again. And then I do guess my figure is sweet. Why, half the girls I know look like old dowdies. I guess my aunt was right, though I did think she was too horrid cruel.|$|R
