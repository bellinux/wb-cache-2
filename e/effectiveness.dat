5|$|A character's {{performance}} in battle {{is determined by}} numerical values ("statistics") for four categories. Each statistic has a range of 1 to 99. The categories are strength, the <b>effectiveness</b> of physical attacks; defense, the ability to reduce damage received; agility, the <b>effectiveness</b> of ranged weapons or skills and at avoiding attacks; and mana, the <b>effectiveness</b> of magical attacks. A character's health is measured in hit points (HP), consisting of a current HP statistic and a maximum HP statistic, ranging from 0 to 999. Character statistics are relative to their class—humans have higher HP levels, strength, and defense, and mutants are physically weaker but enjoy a higher mana statistic. Human and mutant statistics can be amplified by worn equipment of different types. Monster-class characters are dependent on their sub-class, and their statistics vary greatly.|$|E

5|$|Along with rheumatic fever, Kawasaki disease {{remains one}} of the few {{indications}} for aspirin use in children in spite of a lack of high quality evidence for its <b>effectiveness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Birth control {{methods include}} barrier methods, {{hormonal}} birth control, intrauterine devices (IUDs), sterilization, and behavioral methods. They are used before or during sex while emergency contraceptives are effective {{for up to}} a few days after sex. <b>Effectiveness</b> is generally expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant using a given method during the first year, and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high <b>effectiveness,</b> such as tubal ligation.|$|E
5|$|British {{aircraft}} received fighter {{control from}} warships in San Carlos Water, although its <b>effectiveness</b> was limited by their being stationed {{close to the}} islands, which severely limited the <b>effectiveness</b> of their radar. The differences in tactics and training between 800 Squadron and 801 Squadron has been a point of criticism, suggesting that the losses of several ships were preventable had Sea Harriers from Hermes been used more effectively.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of the <b>effectiveness</b> of {{recompression}} therapy utilizing oxygen {{was first}} shown by Yarbrough and Behnke, {{and has since}} become the standard of care for treatment of DCS.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald and Murphy {{hypothesize that}} PUD {{is caused by}} acid eating away mucosa, and {{demonstrate}} the <b>effectiveness</b> of urea {{as a treatment for}} PUD.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Parks Canada {{began to}} study the <b>effectiveness</b> of electro-mats, large mats that give a small {{electric}} shock to animals that step on them, as a potential deterrent around train tracks. A trial installment of the mats was placed in Banff to test their <b>effectiveness</b> in deterring animals like bears from gaining access to the fenced train tracks inside the park.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{due to the}} <b>effectiveness</b> {{shown by}} the Royal Navy during the bombardment, there were no further rebellions against British {{influence}} during the remaining 67 years of the protectorate.|$|E
5|$|Several {{subsequent}} studies put aspirin's <b>effectiveness</b> as a heart drug on firmer ground, but {{the evidence}} was not incontrovertible. However, in the mid-1980s, with the relatively new technique of meta-analysis, statistician Richard Peto convinced the U.S. FDA {{and much of the}} medical community that the aspirin studies, in aggregate, showed aspirin's <b>effectiveness</b> with relative certainty. By the end of the 1980s, aspirin was widely used as a preventive drug for heart attacks and had regained its former position as the top-selling analgesic in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Team <b>effectiveness</b> (also {{referred}} to as group <b>effectiveness)</b> is the capacity a team has to accomplish the goals or objectives administered by an authorized personnel or the organization. A team {{is a collection of}} individuals who are interdependent in their tasks, share responsibility for outcomes, and view themselves as a unit embedded in an institutional or organizational system which operates within the established boundaries of that system. Teams and groups have established a synonymous relationship within the confines of processes and research relating to their <b>effectiveness</b> (i.e. group cohesiveness, teamwork) while still maintaining their independence as two separate units, as groups and their members are independent of each other's role, skill, knowledge or purpose versus teams and their members, who are interdependent upon each other's role, skill, knowledge and purpose.|$|E
5|$|The CAGE {{questionnaire}} {{has demonstrated}} a high <b>effectiveness</b> in detecting alcohol-related problems; however, it has limitations {{in people with}} less severe alcohol-related problems, white women and college students.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of many {{hoverfly}} species principally {{feed upon}} aphids, one larva devouring up to 400 in its lifetime. Their <b>effectiveness</b> in commercial crops {{has not been}} studied.|$|E
5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the <b>effectiveness</b> of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The <b>effectiveness</b> of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} no studies so far on the <b>effectiveness</b> of {{paracetamol}} when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.|$|E
25|$|Conventional or {{mainstream}} medicine includes specific {{practices and}} techniques {{based on the}} best available evidence demonstrating <b>effectiveness</b> and safety. Qigong is not {{generally considered to be}} part of mainstream medicine because clinical research concerning <b>effectiveness</b> of qigong for specific medical conditions is inconclusive at this stage, and because at present there is no medical consensus concerning <b>effectiveness</b> of qigong.|$|E
25|$|<b>Effectiveness</b> {{of control}} systems.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} the topic of various {{research}} studies to establish that organizational <b>effectiveness</b> depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of <b>effectiveness</b> vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, {{the first step in}} evaluating organizational <b>effectiveness</b> is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.|$|E
25|$|Both {{minocycline}} and doxycycline {{have shown}} <b>effectiveness</b> in asthma due to immune suppressing effects. Minocycline {{as well as}} doxycycline have modest <b>effectiveness</b> in treating rheumatoid arthritis. However, the 2015 American College of Rheumatology guideline {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis does not include minocycline.|$|E

25|$|In a 2013 {{study in}} a {{comparison}} of 15 antipsychotic drugs in <b>effectiveness</b> in treating schizophrenic symptoms, clozapine was ranked first, demonstrating very high <b>effectiveness.</b> 25% more effective than amisulpride (2nd), 33% more effective than olanzapine (3rd), and twice as effective as haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>effectiveness</b> of {{respirators}} {{may vary}} depending on different circumstances related to the organization of their application, the RPE should be used {{as part of a}} respiratory protection program (a complex of measures aimed at eliminating the causes which may reduce the <b>effectiveness</b> of respiratory protection).|$|E
25|$|Typical use <b>effectiveness</b> {{is lower}} than most other methods.|$|E
25|$|The {{battlefield}} also {{influences the}} outcome of battle. All combat units {{have access to a}} variety of formations, that change their <b>effectiveness</b> against certain kinds of enemy troops. The landscape also influences the <b>effectiveness</b> of certain warriors: the actions in the forestry areas prevents the cavalry, in contrast to the open space.|$|E

25|$|Parents and {{community}} activates {{around the country}} explain that the education system are failing student. Standardized testing is included in {{efforts to improve the}} education system. Standardized testing gives a detailed account of how student improvement and teach <b>effectiveness</b> are evaluated, which can show how the school <b>effectiveness</b> sits on a national scale.|$|E
25|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that tetracycline antibiotics impair the <b>effectiveness</b> of {{many types of}} hormonal contraception. Recent research has shown no significant loss of <b>effectiveness</b> in oral contraceptives while using most tetracyclines. Despite these studies, many physicians still recommend the use of barrier contraception for people taking any tetracyclines to prevent unwanted pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Most experts {{recommend}} using multiple measures to evaluate teacher <b>effectiveness.</b>|$|E
