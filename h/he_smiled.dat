25|$|From the batsman’s {{viewpoint}} {{it looked}} perfect. It was a rusty brown, {{but seemed to}} hold a thousand runs, and both Hammond and Bradman were enthusiastic in their keenness to win the toss. When the England skipper called correctly <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> with confident pleasure.... Imagine Hammond's surprise when before an hour had passed the wicket, which looked so docile, {{was in fact a}} dangerous spin-taking nightmare.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the young}} Kashgari women were most {{attractive}} in appearance, {{and some of the}} little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under a jaunty little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands out in my memory. He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> and salaamed to us I thought he looked like a fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E

25|$|Another Inuit named Mike (Samson Jorah) {{encounters}} Tyler, sent by Ootek for companionship. Mike knows English and Inuit, translating between Ootek and Tyler. Ootek, the elder, {{is content}} and curious about Tyler, while the younger Mike seems {{not only more}} reserved but unhappy with the Inuit way of life, confessing to Tyler his social apprehensions, this is mainly {{due to the fact}} that Mike is missing nearly all his teeth as well as telling Tyler about the time he met a girl and how she was comfortable with him until <b>he</b> <b>smiled.</b> Tyler discovers that Mike is a wolf hunter, killing for pelts to sell to make a living. Tyler demonstrates a trick he has learned: by playing certain notes on his bassoon, he can imitate a wolf howl, calling other wolves in.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} {{opened and}} immediately garnered widespread praise, especially for its acoustics. After attending {{a week of}} performances in the hall, a music critic for The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic account of the experience and congratulated the architects. One of Pei's associates told him during a party before the opening that the symphony hall was [...] "a very mature building"; <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> and replied: [...] "Ah, but did I have to wait this long?" ...|$|E
500|$|... was an {{impulsive}} young man. From rare {{photographs and}} {{the testimony of}} his contemporaries emerges [...] a figure of medium stature, with slightly drooped shoulders, thick brown hair, and a pale oval face. His eyebrows were dark, {{and one of them}} was almost always raised, giving his face an expression of intense irony. His eyes burned with constant passion, and his lips were full and sensuous. There was also something young and vulnerable in his smile. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> often, and his conversation was reputed to be brilliant.|$|E
60|$|It {{was evident}} that the little officer’s nerves were good, for <b>he</b> <b>smile</b> contemptuously.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed you did. Ah! see <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> again. Why this is freedom! There is no {{such thing}} as sorrow. Tis a lie to frighten fools!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So ye're pertickler {{about the}} people ye take in, are ye?" [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>smiling.</b> [...] "That's all right, but ye made Bill awful mad." ...|$|R
500|$|Watson also observes, [...] "Similarly, the Dutch Defence looks {{particularly}} sterile when White achieves the reversed positions a tempo up (it {{turns out}} that he has nothing useful to do!); and indeed, many standard Black openings are not very inspiring when one gets them as White, tempo in hand." [...] GM Alex Yermolinsky likewise notes that GM Vladimir Malaniuk, a successful exponent of the Leningrad Dutch (1.d4 f5 2.g3 g6) at the highest levels, [...] "once made a deep impression on me by casually dismissing someone's suggestion that he should try 1.f4 as White. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> and said, 'That extra move's gonna hurt me.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes-Benz withdrew {{entirely from}} motor racing {{at the start}} of 1932 {{in the face of the}} {{economic}} crisis, so Caracciola moved to Alfa Romeo with a promise to return to Mercedes if they resumed racing. His contract stipulated he would begin racing for the Italian team as a semi-independent. Caracciola later wrote that the Alfa Romeo manager was defensive when he questioned him about this clause; Caracciola believed it was because the firm's Italian drivers did not believe he could change from the huge Mercedes cars to the much smaller Alfa Romeos. His first race for his new team was at the Mille Miglia; he led early in the race, but retired when a valve connection broke. Caracciola later wrote, [...] "I can still see the expression on [...] Campari's face when I arrived back at the factory. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> to himself as if to say, Well, didn't I tell you that one wasn't going to make it?" ...|$|E
500|$|Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, set out {{the case}} for the prosecution. The {{evidence}} was overwhelming; the prosecution case highlighted the contents of Lody's notebook and the luggage that he had left at the Roxburgh Hotel, and called a series of witnesses, including the elderly Scottish woman who ran the boarding-house in which he had stayed in Edinburgh and the fashionably dressed Ida McClyment, who caused a stir when she described her meeting with Lody aboard the London to Edinburgh train. Bodkin did not read the incriminating letters aloud, due to the sensitivity of their content, but described them in general terms. The witnesses testified about their interactions with Lody and identified him as the man who had posed as [...] "Charles A. Inglis", though the proprietress of the Edinburgh boarding-house experienced some difficulty. When she [...] "was asked if she could see 'Charles A. Inglis' in court, [...] looked everywhere except at the dock. Lody, who was sitting, stood up and gently waved his hands to attract her attention, while <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> broadly and almost broke into laughter at the absurdity of the situation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My name is Mr. Glascock," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>smiling.</b> Then the {{introduction}} was made; and the American Minister {{took off his}} hat, and was very affable.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not altogether,' said <b>he,</b> <b>smiling</b> in return. 'For {{suppose that}} I {{had said to}} myself, We Platonists agree that the sight of God is the highest good.' ...|$|R

500|$|On July 7, he was {{selected}} to his seventh consecutive All-Star Game, played at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. [...] In the Reds' clubhouse for the All-Star Game, Molina shared a locker with Reds' second baseman Brandon Phillips. [...] Since the brawl between the Cardinals and Reds in 2010, [...] the two mended their schism, and Molina has a photograph of their families together. [...] When informed whose locker he was using, Molina replied, [...] "This is Phillips' locker? [...] How about that? [...] I'll have to write something to him." [...] While the pregame roster introductions were made, Reds fans booed all six Cardinals players who were selected, and even former Cardinal Albert Pujols. [...] When Molina was introduced, <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> and turned and pointed his thumbs {{toward the back of}} his jersey. [...] Pujols provided levity when he then joined in the booing. [...] After the game, Molina remarked to reporters, [...] "when you spend 12 years coming to Cincinnati and you beat them so many times, they’re going to boo you." [...] In his career to that point, he hit [...]319 with a [...]352 on-base percentage and [...]500 slugging percentage in 270 career at-bats at Great American Ball Park.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} home, Young states, [...] "He died {{suddenly}} noon Monday. I saw him Sunday afternoon – <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> – and amongst other things, said, “Are {{you sure you}} are quite well?" [...] "Quite." [...] I said, {{and then he said}} [...] "I don’t understand." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Group Captain [...] "Laddie" [...] Lucas, Beurling was [...] "untidy, with a {{shock of}} fair tousled hair above {{penetrating}} blue eyes. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> a lot and the smile came straight out of those striking eyes... he was highly strung, brash and outspoken... something of a rebel".|$|E
6000|$|When {{the stars}} threw down their spears, And watered heaven with their tears, Did <b>He</b> <b>smile</b> His work to see? Did He {{who made the}} lamb make thee? ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Caryll was {{the only}} one with the {{presence}} of mind to welcome him. [...] "Ha!" [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>smiling</b> engagingly. [...] "My little friend, the brewer of ale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps so," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>smiling.</b> [...] "But I {{have been}} {{listening}} carefully at the window for ten minutes; and I certainly dreamt that I heard Auld Robin Gray." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Gemara relates {{that once}} Rabban Gamaliel, Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah, Rabbi Joshua, and Rabbi Akiva went to Jerusalem after the {{destruction}} of the Temple, and just as they came to Mount Scopus, they saw a fox emerging from the Holy of Holies. The first three Rabbis began to cry, but Akiva smiled. The three asked him why <b>he</b> <b>smiled,</b> but Akiva asked them why they wept. Quoting [...] they told him that they wept because a place of which it was once said, [...] "And the common man that draws near shall be put to death," [...] had become the haunt of foxes. Akiva replied that <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> because this fulfilled the prophecy of Uriah the priest, who prophesied (along with Micah, as reported in [...] ) that [...] "Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the House as the high places of a forest." [...] And [...] linked Uriah's prophecy with Zechariah's. And [...] prophesied that [...] "here shall yet old men and old women sit in the broad places of Jerusalem." [...] So the fulfillment of Uriah's prophecy gave Akiva certainty that Zechariah's hopeful prophecy would also find fulfillment. The others then told Akiva that he had comforted them.|$|E
2500|$|Robinson was {{successful}} despite the obstacle of racism. A favorite Robinson anecdote {{is that he}} seated himself in a restaurant and a customer objected to his presence. When the manager suggested {{that it might be}} better if Robinson leave, <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> and asked, [...] "Have you got a ten-dollar bill?" [...] Politely asking to borrow the manager's note for a moment, Robinson added six $10 bills from his own wallet and mixed them up, then extended the seven bills together, adding, [...] "Here, let's see you pick out the colored one". The restaurant manager served Robinson without further delay.|$|E
2500|$|During the inauguration, {{there were}} two matters of controversy. First, {{although}} Obama constitutionally assumed the Presidency at noon on January 20, he did not complete {{the oath of office}} until 12:05pm. Clinton also completed the oath about five minutes late during his first inauguration. Additionally, Obama and the administering official, Chief Justice of the United States John G. Roberts, did not execute the 35-word oath as prescribed by the United States Constitution. First, Obama jumped in before the [...] "do solemnly swear" [...] phrase, which seemed to throw the Chief Justice off his stride. Subsequently, Roberts moved the word [...] "faithfully" [...] back nine spots, and used [...] "to" [...] instead of [...] "of." [...] That threw the president off, and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> and paused to collect his thoughts, then decided to follow Roberts' lead. The flaw is recorded in the transcript of the oath as follows: ...|$|E

6000|$|... (Raina looks doubtfully at him. <b>He</b> <b>smiles</b> [...] foolishly. She goes reluctantly, turning [...] {{again at}} the door, and almost {{catching}} him [...] {{in the act of}} yawning. She goes out.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Kelly then {{heard the}} {{approach}} of Kennedy and Scanlan, and the four gang members concealed themselves, some behind logs, {{and one in the}} tent. They forced McIntyre to sit on a log, and Kelly threatened, [...] "Mind, I have a rifle for you if you give any alarm." [...] Kennedy and Scanlan rode into the camp. McIntyre went forward and said, [...] "Sergeant, I think you had better dismount and surrender, as you are surrounded." [...] Kelly at the same time called out, [...] "Put up your hands." [...] Kennedy appeared to think it was Lonigan who called out, and that a jest was intended, for <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> and put his hand on his revolver case. He was instantly fired at, but not hit. Kennedy then realised the hopelessness of his position, jumped off his horse, and begged for his life, [...] "It's all right, stop it, stop it." [...] Scanlan jumped down and tried to make for a tree, but before he could unsling his rifle, he was shot and killed.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> pleasantly at me, {{and when}} <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> his {{expression}} was kindly--anything but cruel or vindictive.|$|E
60|$|As {{has been}} said before, the bishop could smile under almost any circumstances, and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> now, {{but at the same}} time his brow wrinkled, which was not common when <b>he</b> <b>smiled.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>smiling,</b> [...] "that is no {{subject of}} regret at all. I have no {{pleasure}} in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself {{fit to be}} seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{the stars}} threw down their spears, [...] And watered heaven with their tears, [...] Did <b>he</b> <b>smile</b> {{his work to}} see? [...] Did he who made the lamb make thee? ...|$|R
