40|$|The study {{included}} Polish cultivars and lines of naked types of Avena sativa L. and <b>husked</b> <b>oat</b> (Avena sativa L.). The objective of work was to gain knowledge of oats adequate for functional food production. Statistically {{significant differences among}} the cultivars studied were demonstrated {{in the content of}} the chemical components under determination. It was found that in certain cultivars the protein content exceeded the level of 20 % d. m. in the 3 -year study period. High levels of protein in those cultivars make them especially suitable for food production. It was demonstrated that the naked oat cultivars and lines were characterized by a higher fat content compared to the <b>husked</b> <b>oat</b> forms. The average fat content in the naked cultivars varied from 7. 61 % d. m. to 8. 74 % d. m., while the <b>husked</b> <b>oat</b> forms had fat content from 5. 54 % d. m. to 7. 23 % d. m. Oat fat of the cultivars and lines studied contained ca. 80 % unsaturated fatty acids, with the largest amounts of linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) and oleic acid (C 18 : 1 cis). Approximately one half of the unsaturated fatty acids in the samples studied were essential fatty acids.

The fol-lowing weed control levels were compared: A – control object; B – harrowing twice; C – application of the herbicide Mustang 306 SE; D – herbicide Mustang 306 SE + foliar fertilizer Insol 3; E – herbicide Mustang 306 SE + two foliar fertilizers: Insol 3 and FoliCare 18 : 18 : 18. The <b>husked</b> <b>oat</b> cv. Krezus was more competitive again-st weeds. Number of dicotyledonous weeds and of monocotyle-donous weeds, total weeds, and air-dry weight of above-ground parts of weeds in the crop of this cultivar were all significantly lower compared to the naked cv. Cacko. From the group of dico-tyledonous species, Chenopodium album, Galinsoga parviflora, Matricaria maritima ssp. inodora, Polygonum aviculare, and Stellaria media were the dominant species in the crops of the oat varieties under investigation, whereas among the monocoty-ledonous species Echinochloa crus-galli, Setaria pumila, Apera spica-venti, and Elymus repens occurred in greatest numbers.

40|$|The {{effect of}} variety, agronomic and {{environmental}} factors on the chemical composition and energy value for ruminants and non-ruminants of husked and naked oats grain was studied. Winter oats were grown as experimental plots in each of 2 years on three sites in England. At each site two conventional <b>husked</b> <b>oat</b> cultivars (Gerald and Image) and two naked cultivars (Kynon and Pendragon) were grown. At each site, crops were sown on two dates and all crops were grown with the application of either zero or optimum fertiliser nitrogen. Variety and factors contained within the site + year effect had the greatest influence on the chemical composition and nutritive value of oats, followed by nitrogen ferfiliser treatment. For example, compared with zero nitrogen, the optimum nitrogen fertiliser treatment resulted in a consistent and significant (P < 0. 001) increase in crude protein for all varieties at all sites {{from an average of}} 95 to 118 g kg(- 1) DM, increased the potassium concentration in all varieties from an average of 4. 9 to 5. 1 g kg(- 1) DM (P < 0. 01) and reduced total lipid by a small but significant (P < 0. 001) amount. Optimum nitrogen increased (P < 0. 001) the NDF concentration in the two husked varieties and in the naked variety Pendragon. Naked cultivars were lower in fibre, had considerably higher energy, total lipid, linoleic acid, protein, starch and essential amino acids than the husked cultivars.

In the dehulled grains: TPs values were influenced by the genotype only, as both Donata samples showed higher values than the two Flavia samples; total antioxidant capacity did not show any difference due to soil or genetic; total AVNs showed a significantly higher value only in C 1 sample, with respect to C 2 and C 3, thus emphasizing differences due to soil type and cultivar, respectively; β-glucan did not show significant difference due to cultivar or soil. The milling process significantly decreased TPs and ORAC values in all samples, but the reduction was higher in Donata than Flavia. Total AVNs were reduced by the milling process only in the Donata samples, whereas β-glucan did not show any reduction.

Det ble utført fôringsforsøk for å studere effekten av ulik diettsammensetning og fôringsregime på blindtarmens utvikling og innhold. Blindtarmprøver ble analysert for både partikkelstørrelse og stivelse. I en periode fra 7 - 34 dagers alder ble 207 slaktekyllinger (Ross 308) tildelt en hvetebasert diett med eller uten fytase, med eller uten havreskall, og fôret enten {{ad libitum}} eller tildelt måltider. Kyllinger fôret ad libitum, hadde kontinuerlig tilgang til fôr, mens de som ble måltidsfôret fikk tildelt fôret fire ganger daglig. Prøveresultatene fra 21 dag gamle kyllinger viste små forskjeller i blindtarmsutviklingen mellom de ulike behandlingene; ingen samspillseffekter ble observert. Tørt innhold i blindtarmene økte signifikant (P< 0, 05) når kyllingene ble måltidsfôret. Tørrstoffprosenten var signifikant lavere (P< 0, 05) for kyllingene som fikk dietten tilsatt fytase. Havreskall i dietten ga større mengde små partikler i blindtarmsinnholdet (Ø 26, 6 µm), enn finmalt fôr (Ø 31, 2 µm). Forsøksresultatene fra dag 34 viste lite effekt på blindtarmsinnhold etter 16 timer fasting. Stivelsesprosent økte signifikant 3 timer etter fôring. Det ble observert en signifikant nedgang (P< 0, 05) i tørrstoffprosenten i timene etter fôring. Vekt til tom blindsekk var signifikant høyere (P< 0, 05) hos kyllingene fôret med grovt strukturfôr. Det kan bli oppsummert at blindtarmen er lite påvirket av fôring. Blindtarmene ser ut til å ha en ”back-up”funksjon i tider med lite eller ingen fôrtilgang, ved å holde på næringsstoffer over lang tid, som kan forsyne kyllingen med livsnødvendig energi. Abstract: The {{importance}} {{and functions of}} the caeca in commercial broiler chickens a little researched area. In this study, feed trials were done to investigate the effect of different diet compositions and feeding regimes, on the development and content in the ceca. 207 broiler chickens (Ross 308) were given a wheat based diet with and without the enzyme fytase, with and without <b>oat</b> <b>husks,</b> and were either fed ad libitum or with limited feed. This {{was done in the}} period of age 7 – 34 days. The chickens fed ad libitum had constant access to feed, while the chickens limited feed were fed four times a day. The test results from 21 days old chickens showed small differences in caeca development between the different feed regimes. No interaction effects were observed. Dry matter content in the caeca increased significantly (P< 0, 05) when feed was limited. The dry matter percentage was significant lower (P< 0, 05) for chickens who were given feed with fytase. <b>Oat</b> <b>husks</b> in the diet gave a larger amount of small particles in the caeca content (Ø 26, 6 µm), compared to finely ground feed (Ø 31, 2 µm). Test results from day 34 showed to have little effect on caeca content after 16 hours period of fasting. The starch percentage increased significantly 3 hours after feeding; the percentage was highest for feed with <b>oat</b> <b>husks.</b> It was observed a significant decrease (P< 0, 05) in the dry matter percentage after feeding. The weight of empty caeca was significantly higher (P< 0, 05) in chickens fed with coarse structure feed. In summary, caeca is little affected by feeding. The caeca seems to have a "back-up" function for periods with little or no feed, by keeping nutrients {{for a longer period of}} time, which can supply the chicken with essential energy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA key {{component}} of well-being and healthy lifestyle is healthy food including functional food. Oat (Avena sativa L.) is a well known annual crop in temperate climates. It is recognised as a healthy food containing significant amounts of soluble dietetic fibre, β-glucans, fat-soluble vitamin E and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the world. There are luck investigations in the protein quality and fatty acids composition, but few investigations of dietetic fibre amount and composition till now. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study was to characterise the biochemical composition of <b>husked</b> and naked <b>oat</b> varieties and breeding lines to grown in Latvian condition. In the studied samples content of protein, fat, vitamin E (α-tocopherol), same as composition of amino acids, fatty acids and dietary fibre were determined.

40|$|Background: Wood rotting white-rot and litter-decomposing {{basidiomycetes}} form a huge {{reservoir of}} oxidative enzymes, needed for {{applications in the}} pulp and paper and textile industries and for bioremediation. Objective: The aim was (i) to achieve higher throughput in enzyme screening through miniaturization and automatization of the activity assays, and (ii) to discover fungi which produce efficient oxidoreductases for industrial purposes. Methods: Miniaturized activity assays mostly using dyes as substrate were carried out for lignin peroxidase, versatile peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and laccase. Methods were validated and 53 species of basidiomycetes were screened for lignin modifying enzymes when cultivated in liquid mineral, soy, peptone and solid state <b>oat</b> <b>husk</b> medium. Results: Manganese peroxidases were the most common enzymes produced by 96 % of the species. They typically had acidic pH optima, although Hyphodontia sp., Pleurotus pulmonarius and Trametes ochracea produced enzymes highly active at pH 7. Versatile peroxidase was produced by 66 % of the fungi with efficient production from Phlebia radiata, P. pulmonarius and Galerina marginata. Novel lignin peroxidase producing fungi Cylindrobasidium evolvens and Daedaleopsis septentrionalis were found among the 26 % of the species showing here lignin peroxidase production. Laccase was shown in 92 % of the species. Several fungi produced laccase active at pH 7, which is noteworthy because usually laccases of white-rot fungi are efficient and relevant for many industrial applications. Conclusion: Automated screening allowed us to monitor many specific enzyme activities and extend the range of assay conditions from relatively small fungal cultivation sample volumes...|$|R
40|$|Publisher Summary Studies using a mixed fiber diet have {{emphasized}} the strong impact of dietary fibers (DF) on gut microbiota. As an example, a high-fiber diet containing 40 % soya cake, 20 % crude potato starch, 19 % wheat bran, and 5 % each of apple pectin and carob gum, given for 4 weeks to rats, led to a daily fecal output of anaerobes 71 times higher than a fiber-free diet. Similarly, daily excretion of total fermentation products was 20 times higher, with an increase of propionate and butyrate proportions. It is estimated that apples could provide 10 %– 30 % of the daily intake of fiber. Using a diet containing 100 g of apple fiber/kg, {{it has been shown}} that soluble dietary fiber (SDF) excreted in feces of rats was 10. 9 % of the SDF ingested, which suggests a low resistance to fermentation of this fraction, while only 43 % of the ingested insoluble fiber was fermented. The effects of five DF from different sources (carrot, wheat bran, cocoa seed, pea hull, and <b>oat</b> <b>husks)</b> have been assessed in human microbiota-associated (HMA) rats. HMA rats are initially germ-free rats colonized after weaning with the fecal microbiota of a healthy human volunteer. Use of this animal model is justified by the phylogenetic and metabolic differences between rats and human microbiota and the knowledge that HMA rodents globally retain the characteristics of the human donor microbiota. All of the diets contained 100 g fiber/kg and were given for 8 weeks. Both carrot and cocoa led to a higher proportion of acetate and a lower proportion of propionate in the cecum, and to a large production of methane. The concentration of lactate was significantly higher in rats fed on the carrot-fiber diet...|$|R
40|$|In this {{presentation}} {{the development}} of an innovative oat product for the Italian food market was revised. The work was grounded on two aspects: i) the scientific data highlighting the positive role of oat fibre components in reducing the risk of heart diseases and in influencing cholesterol and glucose metabolism; ii) the growing demand of new opportunities to increase human consumption of oats and to promote health through a higher intake of oat soluble fibre. The project was carried out across different steps. The first step involved the identification of the consumers of interest, together with the most convenient product for them. Children and elders were selected as target consumers, then alimentary pasta, traditional Italian food, was chosen as a suitable product, as both groups could get health benefits from the improvement of its nutritional value through oat enrichment. The second step was focused on the choice of the raw material to be utilised: therefore, genetic variability for the functional compounds of the oat kernel (protein, â-glucan, total dietary fibre) was explored. Both <b>husked</b> and naked <b>oat</b> cultivars were considered in this analysis, the latter resulting the most suited material for pasta production. Finally, lowinput agronomical conditions were optimised for seed multiplication, as they favoured the accumulation of functional compounds in the kernel, safeguarding {{at the same time the}} environment. In collaboration with an Italian pasta industry, an innovative oat-enriched food was developed, using natural sources (oat flour and durum wheat semolina). The oat-wheat pasta was then proposed to a panel of consumers: it showed all the qualities to be included in the market of dietetic products, as it preserved the good organoleptic characteristics of natural foods, together with a better nutritional value, due to its higher content of good-quality protein, total dietary fibre and â-glucan. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the production and}} properties of xylanases from Trichoderma reesei Rut C- 30 and Thermomyces lanuginosus DSM 10635. The thermostability of several T. reesei xylanase II mutants was also studied. T. reesei Rut C- 30 responds to the pH of the growth environment by modifying its enzyme production patterns. The production of the xylanases I, II and III by T. reesei at different pH conditions correlates with the pH-dependent activity pattern of the enzymes. The xylanase was preferentially produced when it is most active in that particular pH environment. The highest total xylanase production with T. reesei Rut C- 30 was achieved at pH 6 on a lactose-based medium. Among the pentoses and hexoses tested, L-arabinose was the most effective inducer of the xylanases. Furthermore, in co-metabolism of L-arabinose and D-glucose, {{the addition of the}} former relieved the repression of D-glucose on xylanase production. The replacement of part lactose with L-arabinose resulted in significant improvement in xylanase production. Small amounts of bulky L-arabinose-rich plant materials, such as sugar beet pulp and <b>oat</b> <b>husk</b> hydrolysates, stimulated the xylanase production. While xylanase production was improved by these approaches, the cellulase production was not enhanced. In addition, the stability and activity of T. reesei xylanase II mutants containing different combinations of disulphide bridges were studied. The most stable combination mutant showed about 5000 -fold half-life at 65  °C compared to the wild type xylanase II. The molecular system controlling xylanase induction was fundamentally different in T. reesei and T. lanuginosus. Unlike T. reesei Rut C- 30, T. lanuginosus DSM 10635 xylanase was not induced by L-arabinose or lactose. The amino acid sequence of DSM 10635 xylanase was most likely {{the same as that of}} T. lanuginosus DSM 5826 xylanase. The temperature-dependent inactivation curve of the DSM 10635 xylanase decreased slowly at neutral or slightly alkaline pH, whereas at low pH, the inactivation was fast. The thermostabilizing effect of the substrate, birchwood xylan, on DSM 10635 xylanase was observed to be significant only under acidic conditions. reviewe...|$|R

Dietary NDO were included {{at the expense of}} purified cellulose. Twenty-five 57 -d-old growing pigs, averaging 15. 9 /-. 6 kg on d 0 of the experiment, were fed a corn-based control diet or the control with 6. 8 or 13. 5 g of FOS/kg or 4. 0 or 8. 0 g of TOS/kg (five pigs per diet). Feces were collected on d 28 to 32, and small-intestinal digesta were collected (slaughter technique) on d 42 to 47 of the experiment. Feeds, feces, and digesta were analyzed for DM, inorganic matter, CP, ether extract, and crude fiber. Dietary NDO did not significantly affect apparent fecal and small intestinal digestion of nutrients in growing pigs. After being fed a NDO-free diet through d 10 after weaning, 38 -d-old weanling pigs (n = 20), averaging 10. 4 /-. 8 kg on d 0 of the experiment, were fed a control diet (based on cornstarch, casein, and <b>oat</b> <b>husk</b> meal) or the control with 10 or 40 g of FOS or TOS/kg (four pigs per diet). Feces and urine were collected on d 13 to 17, and ileal digesta were collected via a postvalve T-cecum cannula on d 33 to 37 of the experiment. Feeds, feces, and digesta were analyzed for DM, inorganic matter, CP, ether extract, starch, NDF, ADF, ADL, Ca, P, Mg, Fe, Cu, and Zn. Nonstarch neutral-detergent soluble carbohydrates (NNSC) completed the mass balance for the carbohydrates. Urine was analyzed for N and minerals. The apparent fecal digestion of NNSC increased in the NDO-supplemented diets. The TOS-fed pigs tended (P<. 10) to have a higher apparent fecal digestion of CP than the FOS-fed and control pigs but excreted more N via the urine (P<. 01). Nitrogen and mineral balances were not affected. The FOS was nearly completely degraded prececally. Mean fiber digestion was lower at the fecal compared with the ileal level, as was the extent of NDO effects. This indicates that fiber digestion requires more than 2 wk to adapt to dietary NDO. Apparent ileal digestion of hemicellulose increased for the NDO-supplemented diets (P<. 05), but that of NNSC decreased (P<. 001). Thus, under the well-controlled conditions of this experiment, dietary NDO hardly affected nutrient digestion in well-kept growing and weanling pigs.

40|$|The {{depletion}} {{of fossil fuels}} {{and the need to}} deal with climate change lead to an increasing interest in renewable resources. Lignocellulosic biomass in general, and agricultural residues in particular, could serve as an excellent starting material for the production of cellulose, basic chemicals, lignin and bioethanol in a biorefinery framework as they are abundant, do not compete with food production and are distributed worldwide. Two factors considerably influence the composition and properties of biorefinery products: biomass feedstock and pretreatment process. Their influence on the separability of raw material into a carbohydrate and lignin fraction as well as the composition and properties of these products are objectives of this study. Hereby, the focus is on lignin, as its structure is particularly dependent on the aforementioned factors complicating its further utilisation. Different agricultural biomass namely barley straw, coconut shell powder, hemp shives, horse manure, maize straw, miscanthus, <b>oat</b> <b>husk,</b> pretreated alfalfa, rape straw, sunflower stalks, tomato stalks and wheat straw were investigated regarding their suitability for lignocellulose separation using alkaline soda pulping. Best separation into a carbohydrate and lignin fraction was achieved for pretreated alfalfa, miscanthus, wheat and barley straw. The purity of the obtained lignin fractions varied in the wide range of 57 % klason-lignin content for sunflower stalks and 81 % for pretreated alfalfa prior to further purification by dialysis. Lignin fractions were characterised by means of FTIR spectroscopy, elementary analysis, thioacidolysis, size-exclusion-chromatography, thermodesorption, differential scanning calorimetry and different wet chemical methods for determination of functional groups. Lignins could be classified into groups, within which they show similar characteristics: (A) horse manure, rape straw, (B) sunflower stalks, tomato stalks, (C) barley-, maize- and wheat straw and (D) hemp shives, miscanthus. In addition, promising lignin candidates were found for several applications. Thus, by screening different agricultural residues, it is possible to choose a specific raw material, in order to produce lignin with desired properties and functionalities. The effect of the pretreatment process was studied based on wheat straw. It was subjected to conventional alkaline pulping, microwave-assisted alkaline pulping and organosolv pulping using formic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Pulping parameters were varied in order to attain best possible separation into a carbohydrate and lignin fraction. Of the varied parameters the concentration of both sodium hydroxide and formic acid has the highest impact on yield and purity of the products for alkaline and organosolv pulping, respectively. It additionally influences the content of functional groups of the lignin fraction and is hence, an important parameter for lignin customisation for subsequent utilisation. Furthermore, the possibility of reducing pulping time by using microwave-assisted pulping instead of conventional alkaline pulping is promising, as the obtained carbohydrate fraction has a low intrinsic viscosity, which may enhance enzymatic hydrolysis...|$|R
30|$|The {{authors of}} this study have {{recently}} published on psychrophilic dry anaerobic digestion of cow feces and wheat straw (27  % TS in feed) at OLR 3.0 – 8.0  g TCOD kg− 1 inoculum day− 1 (Massé and Saady 2015 a, b, c; Saady and Massé 2015). Nevertheless, data on performance of PDAD of cow feces and wheat straw is not available in the accessible literature; therefore, {{the results have been}} compared to the performance of mesophilic and thermophilic DAD of various substrates {{as well as to the}} data recently published by the authors on PDAD of cow feces and wheat straw at feed TS of 27  % (Table  4). Interestingly, the average SMY (187.9  ±  16.5 NL CH 4 kg− 1 VS) obtained from feed TS of 35  % applied at OLR of 3.0  g TCOD kg− 1 inoculum day− 1 was statistically not different from the SMYs (182.9  ±  16.9 and 187.3  ±  18.4 NL CH 4 kg− 1 VS) obtained from feed TS 27  % and OLR of 3.0 and 4.0  g TCOD kg− 1 inoculum day− 1, respectively. The average yield of 187.9  ±  16.5 NL CH 4 kg− 1 VS of cow feces and wheat straw (35  % TS at OLR 3.0  g TCOD kg− 1 inoculum or 2.28  ±  0.14  kg VS fed kg− 1 inoculum day− 1) obtained in this study after 21  days of psychrophilic (20  °C) incubation during the 11 successive cycles is greater than the yield 160 NL CH 4 kg− 1 VS of dairy manure, straw, and <b>oat</b> <b>husk</b> (TS 17  % at OLR of 3.4  g VS kg− 1 day− 1) reported by Schäfer et al. (2006) for Jarna biogas plant in Sweden which operates at 38  °C and retention time of 22  days. Notice that the data reported from Jarna plant is for a steady-state condition where the inoculum was adapted to the substrate and the operation condition for 3  years at the time of the study reported by Schäfer et al. (2006). The SMYs from cow feces and wheat straw at a TCL of 21  days in any of the PDAD eleven successive cycles (TS 35  %) obtained in this study were higher than 28 L CH 4 kg− 1 VS of dairy manure and switch grass (15  % TS) obtained by Ahn et al. (2010) during 62  days of thermophilic (55  °C) incubation. The difference between Ahn et al. (2010) and this study results demonstrate the importance of prolonged adaptation period and the importance of ISR. Ahn et al. (2010) used low ISR (0.2) and non-adapted inoculum in short time study while in this study the inoculum was adapted during around 36  months to stepwise increase in the feed’s total solids (data not shown) and sufficient quantity of inoculum has been used (VS-based ISR ranged between 1.7 and 3.8). The average SMY (188  ±  17 NL CH 4 kg− 1 VS) is similar to 181 L CH 4 kg− 1 VS of beef manure and straw (TS 18  % and OLR of 3.2  g VS kg− 1 day− 1) at 32  °C and retention time of 28  days reported previously (Schäfer et al. 2006) (Table  4). Compared to Schäfer et al. (2006) result, the current study demonstrated an increase of 94  % in the feed total solids and reduction in the treatment cycle length by 25  % while saving the energy consumed in heating the bioreactor (to increase the temperature from 20 to 37  °C); these improvements translate into 35 and 25  % reduction in the required volume of the bioreactor, respectively, while at the same time cutting the reactor heating expenses by operating at psychrophilic condition. Notice that the high yields (> 250 NL CH 4 kg− 1 VS fed) reported by Li et al. (2011 a) was for mesophilic anaerobic digestion of cow manure and wastewater sludge (16  % TS) in 63  days of TCL. Similarly, the yield (339 – 423 NL CH 4 kg− 1 total VS) reported by Sun et al. (1987) in Table  4 have been obtained for long retention times (156 – 198  days) and low OLR (0.35  kg TCOD kg− 1 inoculum day− 1) in mesophilic anaerobic digestion of rice straw and corn stover (TS 15 – 30  %). Interestingly, these researchers reported a very low SMY (34 NL CH 4 kg− 1 VS fed) for the same substrate and experimental conditions at TS 35  %. Achieving a stable dry anaerobic digestion of cow manure and wheat straw at psychrophilic condition and feed TS of 35  % and OLR of OLR 3.0  g TCOD kg− 1 inoculum or 2.28  ±  0.14  kg VS fed kg− 1 inoculum day− 1 over long-term start-up operation is a significant improvement given that 30  % TS has been recently identified as a threshold above which methanogenesis was strongly inhibited for cardboard batch anaerobic digestion at 35  °C (Abbassi-Guendouz et al. 2012).|$|R
