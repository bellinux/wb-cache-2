5|$|On 2 October the RPF {{suffered}} a significant reversal, when leader Fred Rwigyema {{was shot in}} the head and killed. There is a dispute about the exact circumstances of Rwigyema's death; the official line of Kagame's government, and the version mentioned by historian Gérard Prunier in his 1995 book on the subject, was that Rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet. In his 2009 book Africa's World War, however, Prunier states that it is likely Rwigyema was killed by his subcommander Peter Bayingana, following an argument over tactics. According to this account, Rwigyema was conscious of the need to move slowly, and attempt to win over the Hutu in Rwanda before assaulting Kigali, whereas Bayingana and fellow subcommander Chris Bunyenyezi, wished to strike <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> <b>fast,</b> to achieve power as soon as possible; the argument boiled over, causing Bayingana to shoot Rwigyema dead. Another senior RPF officer, Stephen Nduguta, witnessed this shooting and informed President Museveni; Museveni sent his brother Salim Saleh to investigate, and Saleh ordered Bayingana and Bunyenyezi's arrest and eventual execution.|$|E
5|$|While {{the number}} of losses {{incurred}} against German night fighters was not significantly large the psychological damage was substantial. A high number of crashes owed much to nervous British bomber pilots who did not feel safe over their own airfields and consequently landed too <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> or refused to go around a second time for fear of enemy intruders. Just as it appeared night intruder sorties were showing promise Adolf Hitler ordered a cessation of operations. For propaganda purposes, {{he thought that the}} morale of the German people would be better served by seeing British bombers destroyed and wrecked over German territory. Hitler was also reticent owing the fact there had been no noticeable reduction in British air raids and the RAF had not adopted these methods during The Blitz. This order came into effect on 12 October 1941. Kammhuber would unsuccessfully lobby to have intruder operations reinstated and his efforts to expand the intruder force beyond a single unit were thwarted by an uninterested High Command which was inundated with requests for reinforcements in other theatres.|$|E

50|$|Green clay, {{also called}} rubico and {{the brand name}} Har-Tru, is similar to coarse red clay, but is made from crushed metabasalt rather than brick, making the surface {{slightly}} <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>faster.</b> Green clay is packed to make the subsurface. It is then covered with a topping. These courts are located primarily in the eastern and southern United States.|$|R

25|$|Typically, railroads {{operating}} in the United States reserve one- to four-digit identification numbers for powered equipment such as diesel locomotives and six-digit identification numbers for unpowered equipment. There is no <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> rule for how equipment is numbered; each railroad maintains its own numbering policy for its equipment.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy is {{typically}} broken into three periods, or trimesters, each of about three months. Each trimester {{is defined as}} 14 weeks, for a total duration of 42 weeks, although the average duration of pregnancy is 40 weeks. While there are no <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> rules, these distinctions are useful in describing the changes that take place over time.|$|E
5000|$|The writer, Tim Hilton, said: [...] "N{{one of the}} British cyclists had {{experienced}} one of the northern spring classics, so {{they had no idea}} that the Tour could be so much <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> than the races they had known. The early stages were a shock. And then, between Roubaix and Namur, the British had the jolting first experience of the northern French and Belgian roads. One by one they left the race." ...|$|R
25|$|Groups {{also affect}} {{performance}} and productivity. Social facilitation, for example, {{is a tendency}} to work <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> in the presence of others. Social facilitation increases the dominant responses likelihood, which tends to improve performance on simple tasks and reduce it on complex tasks. In contrast, social loafing is the tendency of individuals to slack off when working in a group. Social loafing is common when the task is considered unimportant and individual contributions are not easy to see.|$|R
5000|$|The Counting Crows version (by far {{the more}} {{well-known}} recording) {{is a slow}} and mellow, if emotional, folk rock song. The original by the Himalayans is done in a more [...] "pure" [...] rock style—somewhat <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>faster,</b> with prominent electric guitar and bass parts. In a tradition that has manifested in several Counting Crows songs, the two versions of this song feature somewhat different lyrics. Various live recordings of the song also feature significantly altered lyrics.|$|R
25|$|When a Torah portion is read {{in public}} from a scroll {{as part of}} the synagogue service, it is divided into smaller {{sections}} among several people (for instance, 3 short sections on weekdays or 7 on the Sabbath).

25|$|Mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda) {{consist of}} both ambush predators (‘spearers’) and foragers (‘smashers’). Spearers hide in sandy burrows and capture evasive prey, whereas smashers search for prey {{away from their}} burrows and {{typically}} hammer hard-shelled, sedentary prey. Zebra mantis shrimp (Lysiosquillina maculata) ambush evasive prey primarily at night while hidden in burrows, striking very <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> (mean peak speed 2.30 m s–1 and mean duration 24.98 ms).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{historical}} {{phases of the}} language have been recognised, each distinguished by subtle differences in vocabulary, usage, spelling, morphology, and syntax. There are no <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> rules of classification; different scholars emphasise different features. As a result, the list has variants, as well as alternative names. In addition to the historical phases, Ecclesiastical Latin refers to the styles used by the writers of the Roman Catholic Church {{as well as by}} Protestant scholars from Late Antiquity onward.|$|E
5000|$|While Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails {{has said}} he knows some Korn members and that he thinks they are [...] "cool guys", he also criticized nu metal, saying: [...] "When I'm asked what do I think {{of a lot of}} the nu-metal bands that are out there, my {{response}} is that it seems really insincere to me.

5000|$|Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood is {{the second}} {{full-length}} album by American horror punk band Misfits. It is the last album released to feature founding member and lead vocalist, Glenn Danzig. Danzig released it on his Plan 9 label in December 1983, two months after he played his last concert with the band. It was noticeably <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> than their previous releases, showing more of a hardcore punk sound. Since its release {{it has often been}} referred to as simply [...] "Earth A.D." [...] amongst fans.|$|R
5000|$|Nasenbluten were an Australian {{recording}} and performance group formed in Newcastle in 1992. They {{consisted of three}} DJs, Aaron Lubinski (a.k.a. Xylocaine), David Melo (a.k.a. Disassembler) and Mark Newlands (a.k.a. Mark N, Overcast); and took their name from the German word Nasenbluten, which translates as nosebleed. This refers to the phrase [...] "nosebleed techno" [...] as {{used to describe the}} <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> variants of the techno genre. Early in 1993 Lubinski founded the Dead Girl Records label (initially typset as dEAdGirL) in Swansea.|$|R
25|$|The {{recommendations}} on negotiations {{are concerned with}} what U.S. is after, i.e., GVN action to increase effectiveness of its military effort; to ensure popular support to win war; and to eliminate strains on U.S. Government and public confidence. The negotiating posture is designed not to lay down specific <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> demands or to set a deadline, but to produce movement in Vietnamese Government along these lines. In this way we can test and probe effectiveness of any actions the GVN actually takes and, at the same time, maintain sufficient flexibility to permit U.S. to resume full support of Diệm regime at any time U.S. Government deems it appropriate.|$|E
25|$|Animism {{encompasses}} the beliefs that all material phenomena have agency, that there exists no <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> {{distinction between the}} spiritual and physical (or material) world and that soul or spirit or sentience exists not only in humans, but also in other animals, plants, rocks, geographic features such as mountains or rivers or other entities of the natural environment, including thunder, wind and shadows. Animism thus rejects Cartesian dualism. Animism may further attribute souls to abstract concepts such as words, true names or metaphors in mythology. Some members of the non-tribal world also consider themselves animists (such as author Daniel Quinn, sculptor Lawson Oyekan and many contemporary Pagans).|$|E
25|$|Miller {{finished}} second to Jack Nicklaus at the 1975 Masters, and third at The Open Championship {{later in the}} year at Carnoustie, just a single stroke from playoffs in both. He won his second and final major in 1976, a six stroke victory over Nicklaus and a 19-year-old Seve Ballesteros at The Open Championship at Royal Birkdale. The course had played <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> after scorching hot conditions in England that summer, during the 1976 United Kingdom heat wave, which saw record hot temperatures and several minor fires breaking out in the tournament. Miller's final round of 66 at Royal Birkdale tied the course record.|$|E

25|$|Chessick also {{acknowledged}} {{the dangers of}} relativism implicit in ontological hermeneutics. He acknowledges that the art and theory of interpretation is not bound by today's methods of science that aim to prevent nihilism and relativism. However, Bernstein {{has pointed out that}} there never could be any <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> rules or methods for interpretation because it does not aim to be a science. Gadamer states that the methods of the natural sciences are too impoverished to reveal many truths about human nature and likewise advocated for a hermeneutic approach. Others have made similar arguments for ontological hermeneutics. Chessick writes that the limitations preventing the natural sciences from uncovering certain truths about human nature is precisely why Dilthey initially advocated for a distinction between the natural and human sciences, paving the way for hermeneutics to become a method of inquiry.|$|E
25|$|Nicklaus was {{consistently}} among {{the longest and}} straightest hitters on the PGA Tour during his prime. One early example was winning the official long drive contest at the 1963 PGA Championship with a belt of 341 yards, 17inches (312meters). This record lasted more than 20 years. He preferred the fade (left-to-right shape) for his ball flight, since this allowed the ball to stop quickly on <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> greens. Another factor in this decision was his distance capabilities, which were developed enough {{to allow him to}} play a fade and still reach long par fours and par fives in two shots. Nicklaus considers his longest drive in competition to be during the final round of the 1964 Masters on the 15th hole, where he had less than 160 yards left to the 500 yard par five. He hit an eight-iron slightly over the green for his second shot.|$|E
