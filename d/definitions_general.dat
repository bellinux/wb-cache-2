5000|$|Social Learning Theory plays {{are part}} in the {{socialization}} of terroristic behaviors. Social Learning Theory states that a person becomes deviant because of an abundance of definitions that favor deviant behavior versus definitions that are unfavorable to such behaviors. This theory is broken down into four learning mechanisms: differential association, definitions, differential reinforcement, and imitation. The first learning mechanism is differential association, which refers to [...] "direct association and interaction with others who engage in certain kinds of behaviors or express norms, values, and attitudes supportive of such behavior, as well as indirect association and identification with more distant reference groups." [...] The groups that an individual are differentially associated with provides {{the context in which}} the social learning is operated. The greater the priority, intensity, duration, and frequency of the differential association the greater the effect on behavior, so the theory in relation to terrorism is that the stronger someone's connection is towards a terrorist organization the better chance that person has of also exhibiting terroristic behaviors. The second learning mechanism is definitions. Definitions refer to an [...] "individual's own value and belief system about what is and is not acceptable behavior." [...] These values are learned and reinforced through differential association. There are two types of <b>definitions,</b> <b>general</b> definition and specific definition. General definitions include broad beliefs about conformity that are influenced through conventional means and are often influenced by religious or moral values. Specific definitions are seen as those that align an individual with particular acts of crime. The greater the number of definitions the more likely a person will engage in criminal behavior. So the more definitions an individual has that favor terroristic behavior the greater chance that person has of committing a terroristic acts. The third learning mechanism is differential reinforcement. Differential reinforcement [...] "refers to the balance of anticipated or actual rewards and punishments that follow behavior." [...] An individual refraining from committing a crime depends on a balance of past, present, and anticipated future rewards or punishments for their actions. In regards to terrorism the more direct or indirect social interaction a person has towards terrorism the more likely they are to commit a terroristic act. The fourth and final learning mechanism is imitation. [...] "Imitation is the notion that individuals engage in behaviors that they have previously witnessed others doing." [...] The characters being observed, the behaviors that are being witnessed, and the consequences for those behaviors determine how much an individual imitates a behavior. All of these things need to fall into place in order for an individual to imitate a terrorist.|$|E

40|$|M. A. (Psychology) Professional {{counsellors}} are overloaded {{with many}} cases {{and are in}} dire need of lay assistance. Specifically, pastors are overburdened with the number of counselees seeking their help, and they require lay members of the church to be equipped to counsel on a paraprofessional level. If executed effectively, this lay counselling will act as a filter by letting only those cases needing professional intervention to pass through to the pastor or mental health practitioner. The benefits to be obtained from the Biblical ministry of lay counselling are numerous, the most notable being that chances of burnout are lessened in professionals who now need only focus their attention and energies on. cases specifically requiring their expertise. However, {{as is the case with}} all ministries, there are potential dangers and pitfalls. These can be minimised by proper equipping. It is the knowledgeable, Spirit-filled and welltrained lay counsellor thatis at least risk. Acquiring the practical skills of effective counselling initially involves being formally taught and practising these within a learning environment. This dissertation proposes such a curriculum for the equipping of lay Christian counsellors on both the theoretical and practical levels. Though it is not the first of its kind in the United States, it does reflect a relatively new field in this country and much research must go into developing and modifying curricula for the South African context with its cultures and specific needs. This poses an exciting challenge to the pastors and mental health professionals of this country, who In addition to the actual clientele, will be the onesto benefit. In this dissertation, the domain of the research is introduced by discussions on Christian and lay Christian counselling. <b>Definitions,</b> <b>general</b> assumptions, Biblical basis and uniqueness are presented as well as why lay Christian counselling is a vital aspect of a caring church Some of the common goals that this field shares with secular counselling have been stated, as well as its unique goals. The selection of potential lay Christian counsellors has been discussed, offering some of the desirable therapeutic and ethical qualities of such counsellors [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the growth}} of UK public social and welfare spending (PSS) for 1830 - 1950 {{on the basis of}} a specially constructed dataset, itself a major resource for further research. The data are summarised to establish trends over two sub-periods, 1830 - 90, and 1890 - 50, with testing and assessment of specific explanations for observed trends and fluctuations, with an emphasis on economic and fiscal explanations. These hypotheses are selected from the literature for public spending in general, and social spending in particular. The data are provided in comprehensive worksheets, annualised for the whole period by financial and calendar year, at current and constant prices, disaggregated by territory and programme, and further broken down into seven aspects. The complete data are contained in a separate CD with a linked summary of these data. A summary of sources is in the appendix. Trends are established for each programme and total public social spending from these data. On this basis the central research thesis is tested, that the economic and fiscal explanations add substantially to the standard explanations of the current historiography. A number of the most common non-economic explanations are assessed also for the same two sub periods, 1830 - 90 and 1890 - 1950. Chapter one considers previous work, the database's sources, the difficulties in assembling it and its reliability, a genealogy of terms and <b>definitions,</b> <b>general</b> methodology, and the periodisation adopted. Chapter two provides a review of possible explanations of PSS changes and the selection of the non-economic and economic explanations. The following two chapters, for the two periods, 1830 - 90 and 1890 - 1950, have a common format in which the narrative political history is followed by sections on basic economic trends and the economic impact of public finances. Public social and welfare spending is then discussed by programme, aspect and territory. A summary of the findings for the selected hypotheses concludes each of these chapters. Chapter five draws together the main conclusions. Some political hypotheses are not supported, at least not in their original specifications. The role of non-public social spending, the local-central tensions and the importance of taxable capacity are emphasised. Amongst the economic hypotheses, several are not supported, but Wagner's Law, the Baumol effect, the argument from market and government failure, the close connection between labour market interventions and welfare spending, and the close relation to national debt reduction, add explanatory value for at least one of these sub-periods. These hypotheses may be related, but no single, over-arching explanation is possible, although a final diagram (Figure 5. 5) is offered as a possible schematic of the major forces explaining PSS trendsEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
