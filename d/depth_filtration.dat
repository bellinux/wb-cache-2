30|$|The partial scale {{design was}} used in this study to {{simulate}} both bioretention and permeable pavement. Two parameters were considered in adjusting the Sedfil design; water ponding and <b>depth</b> of <b>filtration</b> media. A typical standard of a bioretention and a permeable pavement surface area that is 3 – 10 % of the total catchment area was followed to meet the 1.5 in storm target (City Of Austin 2011). The initial run was executed with an automatic sizing function to size the pipes required to release runoff inside (from sedimentation to filtration) and outside (discharge) the system. To minimize the function of the sedimentation basin and concentrate on a filtration basin only, which represent the bioretention/permeable pavement, the surface area of the sedimentation area was selected to represent a forebay area that might be installed before a bioretention area. In the case of the permeable pavement, the forebay was totally ignored by selecting the lowest number that the model would allow to minimize this effect. The outlet orifice pipe of the sedimentation basin was selected to be bigger than the one for the filtration to divert most of the runoff to the filtration basin where it will be treated. The <b>depth</b> of the <b>filtration</b> media for the bioretention was selected to be 1200  mm and maximum ponding depth of the water to be 420  mm. The <b>depth</b> of the <b>filtration</b> media for the permeable pavement was 356  mm and maximum ponding depth of the water was 10  mm. One RG and one PP were placed at each subbasin in the watershed and that resulted in total surface areas equivalent to 61217  m 2 and 35526  m 2 for RG and PP, respectively.

40|$|Multiple zeta values (MZVs) are generalizations of Riemann zeta {{values at}} {{positive}} integers to multiple variable setting. These values {{can be further}} generalized to level N multiple polylog values by evaluating multiple polylogs at N-th roots of unity. In this paper, we consider another level N generalization by restricting the indices in the iterated sums defining MZVs to congruences classes modulo N, which we call the MZVs at level N. The goals of this paper are two-fold. First, we shall lay down the theoretical foundations of these values such as their regularizations and double shuffle relations. Second, we will generalize the multiple divisor functions (MDFs) defined by Bachman and Kühn to arbitrary level N and study their relations to MZVs at level N. These functions are all q-series and similar to MZVs, they have both weight and <b>depth</b> <b>filtrations.</b> But unlike that of MZVs, the product of MDFs usually has mixed weights; however, after projecting to the highest weight we can obtain an algebra homomorphism from MDFs to MZVs. Moreover, {{the image of the}} derivation D=qd/dq on MDFs vanishes on the MZV side, which gives rise to many nontrivial Q-linear relations.

5000|$|<b>Depth</b> <b>filtration</b> is also {{widely used}} for the {{clarification}} of cell culture clarification. The cell culture systems can contain yeast, bacterial and other contaminant cells and hence, an efficient clarification stage is vital to separate the cells and other colloidal matter to produce a particle free cell system 9.

The direct flow design in depth filters provides a financially suitable solution by trapping the contaminants within the filter channel while ensuring the maximum recovery rate of the product. The other advantages of this system includes its low power costs, since the pumps utilised in depth filters require minimal power input due to the small pressure within the system. <b>Depth</b> <b>filtration</b> is also flexible {{in terms of being}} able to scale up or down the system while outputting a high rate of yield (>95%) Thomas P.O’brien, Large-scale, Single use of <b>depth</b> <b>filtration</b> systems for mammalian cell culture clarification, 2012.|$|E

40|$|The {{pressure}} drop evolution incurred in diesel particulate filters during the soot loading cycle {{is an important}} quantity of interest for the automotive industry.

On the scale of the filter media, simulations help determine <b>depth</b> and cake <b>filtration</b> parameters as function of deposited dust or time.

50|$|The {{flow rate}} {{is defined as}} the ratio of the driving force over the filter resistance. The two {{conventional}} types of depth filter designs: the rapid and slow filters operate with velocities of 5-15 m/h and 0.1-0.2 m/h respectively; whereas pressurised sand filters have design flow rates of 238 L/min14. During operation the filter rate decreases due to increasing filter resistance as particulates get lodged within the media. The rate of filtration affects the rate of clogging with high filter rates causing faster build up. Pilot tests demonstrate that the higher the filter rate the lower the filter area whilst increasing filter rate reduces the time to breakthrough, reduces the time to head loss (increases head loss) and results in shorter runs and lower optimum depths. They also demonstrate that higher filter rates can be achieved by using larger diameter media and increased media <b>depth.</b> High <b>filtration</b> rates depend on media design with the highest filtration rate design in service at 13.5gpm/ft2.|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} {{biological}} filtration on {{granular activated carbon}} (GAC) has been performed at the Neuilly-sur-Marne (France) treatment plant using experimental pilot filters. Bacterial colonization of GAC was monitored in three carbon filters having varying <b>depths</b> and <b>filtration</b> velocities, but similar empty bed contact time (EBCT). About three months were required to colonize the GAC in the filters and a steady state bacterial biomass of around 2 µgC/cm 3 GAC was reached. During the colonization period, removal of nonbiodegradable organic carbon (NBDOC) by filtration decreased from 50 % to less than 10 % showing a gradual saturation of GAC adsorption capacity. However, biological processes take turn with adsorption to ensure a significant removal of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) {{during the study period}} (more than 200 days). Filters operating under different conditions did not show any difference in the BDOC removal. This indicates that biological removal of organic matter in GAC filters having a given EBCT is independent of filtration rate (in the range 6 m/h– 18 m/h). The maximum bacterial density in the filter effluent water was 1. 5 × 105 bacteria/mL during the colonization phase; this seemed to be linked to a lag in establishing a protozoan population, which, at equilibrium, efficiently removed bacterial biomass produced within the filters. Once established, the efficiency of this complex microbial assemblage was remarkable; the removal of about 0. 25 mgC/L of BDOC resulted in the release of less than 0. 5 × 105 bacteria per millileter, around 0. 0015 mgC/L as bacterial biomass in the effluent. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] ceramic foams potentially offer a more robust configurable alternative filtration medium to monolithic wall flow filters (WFFs) for the reduction in particulate matter (PM) emissions from diesel internal combustion engines. The fundamental back pressure and filtration efficiency characteristics of gel-cast ceramic foam diesel particulate filters (DPFs) have been investigated.

Effects of PM distribution on the pressure drop of the filter are presented. Filters with a non-even distribution of PM were found to have lower pressure drops than filters with an evenly distributed PM for the same average specific PM loadings. The predictions showed that gel-cast ceramic foams can achieve comparable back pressure, filtration volume, and PM holding capacity with WFFs with a lower filtration efficiency of about 80 per cent.
