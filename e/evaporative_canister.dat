25|$|The 1974 Rambler American was a carryover. The only {{difference}} was {{the presence of}} the rear five-mile-per-hour bumper and the rear license plate was relocated {{to the center of the}} rear panel over the gas filler. The standard wheels for the year were VAM's new 14x6-inch five-spoke design with volcano hubcaps. The 258 six included an <b>evaporative</b> <b>canister</b> to reduce emissions, and a slightly lower 8.3:1 compression ratio. However, during the mid-year, the compression ratio was lowered even more to 7.6:1. In both cases, the engines were still advertised as having an output of 170hp. The seat and door panel designs were revised. The parking brake pedal received a new smaller rubber pad.|$|E
5000|$|The fuel tank, {{tank filler}} neck and <b>evaporative</b> <b>canister</b> {{are made of}} {{stainless}} steel. Both the fuel pump and fuel filter are completely sealed inside the gas tank and require a complete replacement of the gas tank if either the fuel pump or filter fail.|$|E
50|$|On July 30, 2014, Suzuki {{recalled}} {{an undisclosed}} number of select model year 2010-2013 Kizashi vehicles manufactured October 2009 through July 2012 due to spiders that may weave a web into the <b>evaporative</b> <b>canister</b> {{causing it to}} become blocked and creating excessive negative pressure within the fuel tank. Negative pressure could cause the fuel tank to crack, resulting in {{a higher risk of}} fire.|$|E
5000|$|The Vino 125 has an {{air-cooled}} [...] single-cylinder 4-stroke SOHC engine. The engine has a fan for supplemental cooling. It has a Mikuni BS carburetor with an auto-choke and carburetor heat device. Emissions {{controls are}} a catalyzed muffler, AIR Injection system, and an <b>evaporative</b> fuel <b>canister.</b> The braking {{system is a}} 180 mm single disc front brake and a 110 mm drum rear brake. The tires are 3.50x10.|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} how the EPA NONROAD {{emission inventory}} model {{accounts for the}} effects of temperature and RVP on diurnal evaporative emissions. Background The EPA NONROAD model estimates diurnal evaporative emissions from gasolinefueled engines. Evaporative emissions from diesel-fueled engines are considered negligible due to the extremely low volatility of diesel fuel and, therefore, are not included in the NONROAD model. Evaporative emissions from most gasoline-fueled engines are very sensitive to the volatility of the fuel (typically expressed as Reid Vapor Pressure or RVP) as well as the temperatures that the fuel experiences. In highway vehicles, this sensitivity is mitigated to some degree by the carbon <b>canister</b> <b>evaporative</b> control systems that have been used for many years, but such control systems are not currently used on nonroad equipment. Modeling of uncontrolled evaporative emissions has been attempted in a variety of ways. The EPA MOBILE model for highway vehicles uses an algorithm based on the Wade equation [1, 2]. This is based on the "Ideal Gas Law " which models pressure, temperature, and volum...|$|R
40|$|Atomobile <b>evaporative</b> {{emission}} <b>canisters</b> contain {{activated carbon}} sorbents that trap and store fuel vapors emitted from automobile fuel tanks {{during periods of}} hot ambient temperatures and after engine operation. When a vehicle is started, combustion air is pulled through the canister, and adsorbed vapors are removed from the sorbent and routed to the intake manifold for combustion along with fuel from the tank. The two primary requirements of an effective canister sorbent are that (1) {{it must be a}} strong enough adsorbent {{to hold on to the}} fuel vapors that contact it and (2) it must be a weak enough adsorbent to release the captured vapors in the presence of the airflow required by the engine for fuel combustion. Most currently available commercial canister sorbents are made from wood, which is reacted with phosphoric acid and heat to yield an activated carbon with optimum pore size for gasoline vapor adsorption. The objectives of Task 5. 7 were to (1) design and construct a test system for evaluating the performance of different sorbents in trapping and releasing butane, gasoline, and other organic vapors; (2) investigate the use of lignite char as an automobile fuel evaporation canister sorbent; (3) compare the adsorbing and desorbing characteristics of lignite chars with those of several commercial sorbents; and (4) investigate whether the presence of ethanol in fuel vapors affects sorbent performance in any way. Tests with two different sorbents (a wood-derived activated carbon and a lignite char) showed that with both sorbents, ethanol vapor breakthrough took about twice as long as hydrocarbon vapor breakthrough. Possible reasons for this, including an increased sorbent affinity for ethanol vapors, will be investigated. If this effect is real (i. e., reproducible over an extensive series of tests under varying conditions), it may help explain why ethanol vapor concentrations in SHED test evaporative emissions are often lower than would be expected...|$|R
