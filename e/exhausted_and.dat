5|$|In September 1994, {{after nearly}} five years of {{directed}} observations, the gas supply for its attitude control was <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> the observatory {{was placed in a}} non-directed survey mode. Transmissions finally ceased on 27 November 1998.|$|E
5|$|By 12 February, the Imperial Guards had {{captured}} the reservoirs and Nee Soon village. The defending troops, by this time, were badly shaken. Thousands of <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> frightened stragglers left the fighting to seek shelter in large buildings. On the same night, British {{forces in the}} east of the island had begun to withdraw towards the city.|$|E

5|$|By {{late evening}} on 7 April, Petrović's reports to Supreme Headquarters {{noted that the}} 4th Army was <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> its morale had been {{degraded}} significantly, and that Nedeljković concurred with his commander's assessment. During the day, Nedeljković moved his headquarters from Zagreb to Bjelovar.|$|E
5|$|The lumber {{industries}} and stone mines {{on both sides}} of the river were eventually <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> closed. Tourists coming up the river from Port Jervis became the mainstay of the local economy. During the next two decades, seasonal homes and hotels were built in Pond Eddy.|$|E
5|$|The {{prolonged}} and escalating ByzantineSassanid {{wars of the}} 6th and 7th {{centuries and}} the recurring outbreaks of bubonic plague (Plague of Justinian) left both empires <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> vulnerable {{in the face of}} the sudden emergence and expansion of the Arabs. The last of these wars ended with victory for the Byzantines: Emperor Heraclius regained all lost territories, and restored the True Cross to Jerusalem in 629.|$|E

5|$|Upon arrival, the {{children}} were <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> virtually naked. Their appearance was skeletal, especially those transported from Stara Gradiška. Many had swollen bellies due to malnourishment, thin pale faces, and teeth falling out. Almost all were suffering from severe diarrhea, and most had multiple diseases. Some children died after the effort of simply getting up.|$|E
5|$|A {{northern}} {{route of}} retreat {{had too many}} obstacles, so Hunter's force retreated westward toward Charleston—with the Confederate army in pursuit. On June 19, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry was the rear guard. The regiment often had to fight dismounted. Averell's entire division fought for two hours near Liberty. His cavalry division fought until its ammunition was <b>exhausted,</b> <b>and</b> then was relieved by Crook's infantry. Averell lost 122 men.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{successfully}} prosecuted his {{operations in}} the war against Paraguay, Inhaúma's leadership was encumbered by his hesitating and procrastinating behavior. While in command in the war zone, he became mentally <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> contracted an unknown disease. Seriously ill, Inhaúma returned to the national capital in early 1869 and died shortly thereafter. Although historical works have not given much coverage to Inhaúma, some historians regard him among the greatest of the Brazilian navy officers.|$|E

5|$|Coatbridge {{also had}} a notorious {{reputation}} for air pollution and the worst excesses of industry. By {{the time of the}} 1920s however, coal seams were <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> the iron industry in Coatbridge was in rapid decline. After the Great Depression the Gartsherrie ironwork was the last remaining iron works in the town. One publication has commented that in modern-day Coatbridge 'coal, iron and steel have all been consigned to the heritage scrap heap'.|$|E
5|$|Despite early victories, Pyrrhus {{found his}} {{position}} in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus {{as long as his}} army remained in Italy. Facing unacceptably heavy losses from each encounter with the Roman army, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula. In 275 BC, Pyrrhus again met the Roman army at the Battle of Beneventum. While Beneventum was indecisive, Pyrrhus realised his army had been <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> reduced by years of foreign campaigns. Seeing little hope for further gains, he withdrew completely from Italy.|$|E
5|$|From a {{military}} point of view, the outcome at Vukovar {{was not a}} disaster for Croatia's overall war effort. The battle broke {{the back of the}} JNA offensive and left Croatia's main adversary <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> unable to press its offensive deeper into the country. Vukovar was probably indefensible, being almost surrounded by Serb-held territory and closer to Belgrade than to Zagreb, and although the defeat was damaging to morale, in a strategic context the damage and delays inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town.|$|E

5|$|Hanada holes up in Misako's {{apartment}} and Number One begins an extended siege, taunting Hanada with threatening {{phone calls and}} forbidding {{him to leave the}} apartment. Eventually, Number One moves in with the now <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> inebriated Hanada under the pretext that he is deciding how to kill him. They agree to a temporary truce and set times to eat, sleep and, later, to link arms everywhere they go. Number One suggests they eat out one day and then disappears during the meal.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in New Zealand Stenhouse learned that nothing had been heard from Shackleton and the Weddell Sea party since their {{departure}} from South Georgia in December 1914; it seemed probable that both arms of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition were requiring relief. Stenhouse was informed by the expedition offices in London that funds had long since been <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> that money for the necessary work on Aurora {{would have to be}} found elsewhere. It was also evident that {{in the minds of the}} authorities the relief of Shackleton's party should have priority over the men marooned at Cape Evans.|$|E
5|$|The Union counteroffensive never came; the Army of the Potomac was <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> {{nearly as}} damaged {{at the end}} of the three days as the Army of Northern Virginia. Meade was content to hold the field. On July 4, the armies {{observed}} an informal truce and collected their dead and wounded. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant accepted the surrender of the Vicksburg garrison along the Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy in two. These two Union victories are generally considered the turning point of the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|Their {{cattle and}} oxen were now <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> lean, but the Donner Party crossed the next stretch of desert {{relatively}} unscathed, and the journey {{seemed to get}} easier, particularly through the valley next to the Ruby Mountains. Despite their near hatred of Hastings, {{they had no choice}} but to follow his tracks, which were weeks old. On September 26, two months after embarking on the cutoff, the Donner Party rejoined the traditional trail along a stream that became known as the Humboldt River. The shortcut had probably delayed them by a month.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve this}} {{objective}} Yigal Allon in entrusted 5 brigades: the Harel and Yiftach (now totalling five battalions), the 8th armoury brigade (newly constituted as the 82nd and 89th battalions), several infantry battalions from the Kiryati and Alexandroni brigades, and 30 pieces of artillery. The 7th brigade {{was sent to}} the northern front. In a first phase, between 9 and 13 July, the Israelis took Lydda and Ramle and reasserted the area around Latrun by taking Salbit, but the forces are <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> the High Command renounced to the objective of taking Ramallah. Two attacks was launched against Latrun.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, {{given the}} {{negative}} {{reaction to the}} Never Let Me Down album and this tour, Bowie found himself creatively <b>exhausted</b> <b>and</b> in low critical standing.
