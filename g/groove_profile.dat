50|$|What all optical {{measuring}} {{methods have}} in common is that the determined groove points must be transformed from the sensor coordinates of the cameras into machine and/or work piece coordinates. To this end, they must be calibrated on test work pieces before the welding process takes place and calibration matrices must be provided. Moreover, for the application of image processing algorithms, information about the <b>groove</b> <b>profile</b> must also be provided in advance. This is carried out via teaching of templates, input of geometrical parameters or teach-in via test work pieces. A more comprehensive image processing for 2 and 3 D sensor systems requires normally a PC system for the evaluation; this is why commercially available PC interfaces are used for data exchange, uniform sensor interfaces do, however, not yet exist.|$|E

The grating fabrication includes two exposures and two developments. In the first step, two collimated laser beams with symmetrical incidence about the normal of the holographic plate generate a grating with quasi-sinusoidal <b>groove</b> <b>profile</b> {{after the first}} development. In the second step only one collimated laser beam irradiates on the plate with a selected incident angle, resulting in a change of <b>groove</b> <b>profile</b> into quasi-triangular after the second development. A blazed holographic grating with 65 % relative diffraction efficiency under non-auto-collimation was obtained in the experiment.

Growth of the multilayers can be perturbed by shadowing effects caused by the highly corrugated surface of the substrates, which results in distortion of the multilayer stack structure and degradation of performance of MBGs. To minimize the shadowing effects we used an ionbeam sputtering machine with a highly collimated atomic flux to deposit Mo/Si multilayers on saw-tooth substrates. The sputtering conditions were optimized by finding a balance between smoothening and roughening processes {{in order to minimize}} degradation of the <b>groove</b> <b>profile</b> in the course of deposition {{and at the same time}} to keep the interfaces of a multilayer stack smooth enough for high efficiency.

Two saw-tooth substrates were deposited at energies of 200 eV and 700 eV for the sputtering ions.
