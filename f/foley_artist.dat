5|$|The Legend of Korra is set {{to music}} by Jeremy Zuckerman, who {{previously}} wrote the music for Avatar: The Last Airbender with Benjamin Wynn. For The Legend of Korra, Zuckerman is the sole composer while Wynn is the lead sound designer; the two collaborate with <b>Foley</b> <b>artist</b> Aran Tanchum and showrunner Mike DiMartino on the soundscape of the series. Konietzko and DiMartino's concept for the score was to blend traditional Chinese music with early jazz. On that basis, Zuckerman composed a score combining elements of Dixieland, traditional Chinese music and Western orchestration. It is performed mainly by a string sextet and various Chinese solo instruments, including a dizi (flute), paigu (drums), a guqin and a Mongolian matouqin.|$|E

25|$|In 1919, US Congress {{passed a}} {{prohibition}} law outlawing the manufacturing and transporting of drinking alcohol. When drinking became illegal, it became popular in underground nightclubs. The {{type of music}} that was played at these underground establishments that were selling alcohol was jazz. It was not seen as upstanding to listen to or perform jazz music, {{because it was an}} African American style and at that time the United States was segregated and racism was an overtly prevalent issue. Because jazz music was seen as great dance music, big band jazz became popular in nightclubs. In the 1920s, freelance drummers emerged. They were hired to play shows, concerts, theaters, clubs and back dancers and artists of various genres. Just as modern drummers have many different roles, so did the drummers of the 1920s. One important role for drummers in the 1920s is what is referred to in modern times as a <b>foley</b> <b>artist.</b> During silent films, an orchestra was hired to accompany the silent film and the drummer was responsible for providing all the sound effects. Drummers played instruments to imitate gun shots, planes flying overhead, a train coming into a train station, and galloping horses etc.|$|E

500|$|<b>Foley</b> <b>artist</b> Casey Crabtree {{provided}} sounds for horse hoof movements, {{work that}} was praised by sounds effects industry expert David Yewdall. He said of Crabtree's work on Brisco, [...] "Her horses sounded so natural and real– their hooves, {{the sound of their}} hooves on the texture of the ground, the sound of saddle movement, bridle jingles– it was as good as anything I would want for a feature film, and this was episodic television." [...] The make-up on many of Briscos episodes was done by veteran artist Mel Berns Jr.|$|E
2500|$|Foley {{sound effects}} are sounds that {{synchronize}} on screen, and require {{the expertise of}} a <b>foley</b> <b>artist</b> to record properly. [...] Footsteps, the movement of hand props (e.g., a tea cup and saucer), and the rustling of cloth are common foley units.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{required}} sound effect is {{of a small}} subject, such as scissors cutting, cloth ripping, or footsteps, the sound effect is best recorded in a studio, under controlled conditions. [...] Such small sounds are often delegated to a <b>foley</b> <b>artist</b> and foley editor. [...] Many sound effects cannot be recorded in a studio, such as explosions, gunfire, and automobile or aircraft maneuvers. [...] These effects must be recorded by a sound effects editor or a professional sound effects recordist.|$|E

5000|$|The {{category}} {{entails the}} sound of footsteps. To produce {{the sound of}} walking down a staircase for example, two <b>Foley</b> <b>artists</b> stomp their feet on a marble slab in a recording studio while watching the footage. Foley studios carry {{many different types of}} shoes and several different types of floors to create footstep sounds. These floors, known as Foley Pits, vary from marble squares to gravel and rock pits. Creating just the right sound of footsteps can greatly enhance the feel of a scene. <b>Foley</b> <b>Artists</b> are often referred to as [...] "Foley Walkers" [...] or [...] "Steppers" [...] when working in the [...] "feet" [...] subset of Foley.|$|R
25|$|Purcell's opera King Arthur was {{presented}} in 2010 in the City Recital Hall {{as if it were}} a 1940s radio play, with <b>foley</b> <b>artists</b> and an on-stage voice-over artist announcing stage directions. The performers were costumed, but in a 1940s style. This concert was nominated for a Limelight Award.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Conjectural Sound" [...] {{principle}} applies even to happenstance sounds, such as tires squealing, doorknobs turning {{or people}} walking. [...] If the sound editor wants to communicate that a driver is {{in a hurry}} to leave, he will cut the sound of tires squealing when the car accelerates from a stop; even if the car is on a dirt road, the effect will work if the audience is dramatically engaged. [...] If a character is afraid of someone {{on the other side of}} a door, the turning of the doorknob can take a second or more, and the mechanism of the knob can possess dozens of clicking parts. [...] A skillful <b>Foley</b> <b>artist</b> can make someone walking calmly across the screen seem terrified simply by giving the actor a different gait.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{two years}} of {{widespread}} publicity about Fett's appearance in The Empire Strikes Back, script rewrites significantly reduced the character's presence in the film. Fett's [...] "distinctive" [...] theme, composed by John Williams, is [...] "not music, exactly" [...] but [...] "more of a gurgly, viola-and-bassoon thing aurally cross-pollinated with some obscure static sounds." [...] Sound editor Ben Burtt added the sound of jangling spurs, created and performed by the <b>Foley</b> <b>artist</b> team of Robert Rutledge and Edward Steidele, to Fett's appearance in Cloud City, intending to make the character menacing and the scene reminiscent of similar gunfighter appearances in Western films. At one point in Return of the Jedis development, Fett was conceived as being a main villain, but he was finally replaced with Emperor Palpatine when Lucas decided to not make a third trilogy of Star Wars. Lucas also considered Fett fighting Lando during the Sarlacc sequence.|$|E

5000|$|During {{production}} or earlier parts of post-production, sound editors, sound designers, sound engineers, production sound mixers and/or music editors assemble the tracks that become {{raw materials for}} the re-recording mixer to work with.

25|$|In {{the early}} days of film and radio, <b>foley</b> <b>artists</b> would add sounds in realtime or {{pre-recorded}} sound effects would be played back from analogue discs in realtime (while watching the picture).

50|$|<b>Foley</b> <b>artists</b> {{recreate}} the realistic ambient sounds {{that the film}} portrays. The props and sets of a film often do not react the same way acoustically as their real life counterparts. Foley sounds are used to enhance the auditory experience of the movie.

5000|$|In television, {{the sound}} editor deals with audio editing, {{adjusting}} and fixing of the soundtrack.

A sound editor also decides what sound effects to use and what effects to achieve from the sound effects, edits and makes new sounds using filters and combining sounds, shaping sound with volume curves, and equalizing. A sound editor places the <b>Foley</b> <b>artist's</b> sounds into the sound track. Often, a sound editor uses a sound effects library, either self-compiled, bought or both.|$|R
