These complementary mattes allow the various image elements to be cleanly isolated, so that as they are re-exposed onto a single, fresh piece of negative, one at a time and in jigsaw fashion, the various images do not show through one another (as they would using simple double exposure). Acquiring the matte film element (as a first-generation original) {{at the same time as}} the live action makes a much better fit during optical printing, because it requires fewer separate, <b>duplicate</b> <b>film</b> generations than does bluescreen (though both processes degrade the image and introduce more [...] "error" [...] to the resulting matte) in the process of achieving sufficiently dense mattes. This increased accuracy ultimately renders the matte [...] "lines" [...] almost invisible, though as with bluescreen, its use may be signaled by hard separation or mismatched coloration and contrast between elements, or in this case, a telltale white/yellow fringe.|$|E

Scott, the Killing Us Softly {{series was}} criticized {{since the second}} entry, Still Killing Us Softly from 1987 was a near <b>duplicate</b> <b>film</b> from the 1979 original, {{so much so that}} she said [...] "Killing Us Softly was casually reissued in almost {{identical}} form as Still Killing Us Softly. At the time, the third and most recent entry, Killing Us Softly 3 was called a [...] "movie sequel" [...] to further criticize the series. Additionally, Scott pointed out the cost to purchase or rent the films and the amount of stickers warning that the content was under copyright protection if they were rented, claiming it [...] "seems a profit motive is at work." [...] There is no need for the films to have such warnings on them [...] "if all Kilbourne wanted was to further 'the cause'" [...] Scott wrote. In Scott's perspective, [...] "one might think {{it would be in the}} interests of the movement feminism if these tapes were copied and circulated as freely and widely as possible." [...] Though Scott was so critical of Kilbourne's method of distribution, she agrees that [...] "corporations that do include a feminist message in their ads are 'co-opting' the movement for private gain." [...] Scott also notes that the reason for such prices on the films are because the target audience is not 'individual consumers' but university libraries, where women's studies programs are a definite audience that will consume such media. After stating such, Scott points out the irony of the feminist speakers paid to speak to these audiences are [...] "making money off women--by complaining about other people making money off women." ...|$|E
40|$|Appressorium {{formation}} {{is an important}} event in establishing a successful interaction between the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, and its host plant, rice. An understanding of molecular events occurring in appressorium differentiation will give new strategies to control rice blast. A quick and reliable method to extract total RNA from appressorium is essential for studying gene expression during appressorium formation and its mechanism. We found that <b>duplicate</b> <b>film</b> is an efficient substratum for appressorium formation, even when inoculated with high density conidia. When inoculated with conidia at 1 × 106 ml− 1, the percentages of conidium germination and appressorium formation were (97. 98 ± 0. 67) % and (97. 88 ± 0. 45) %, respectively. We applied Trizol before appressorium collection for total RNA isolation, {{and as much as}} 113. 6 μg total RNA was isolated from the mature appressoria at 24 h after inoculation. Functional analysis of two genes, MNH 6 and MgATG 1, isolated from the cDNA subtractive library, revealed that the quantity of RNA was good enough to construct a cDNA (complementary DNA) library or a cDNA subtractive library. This method may be also applicable for the appressorium RNA isolation of other pathogenic fungi in which conidia differentiate into appressoria {{in the early stages of}} host infection...|$|E

40|$|The {{description}} of steady non-uniform laminar flow was attempted. The model used {{was that of}} a thin incompressible, isothermal liquid film flowing down an infinitely wide plate. Solutions predicting the film thickness and velocity profiles as a function of distance down the plate were obtained for various initial conditions. The solutions were obtained by using a form of the Mechanical Energy Equation and an approximated form of the equation of motion. The Mechanical Energy Equation was an ordinary differential equation, and as such it was solved numerically by the Modified-modified Euler method. The equation of motion was finally reduced to a linear partial differential equation and also solved numerically. From the results, a correlation for the development of velocity profiles {{as a function of the}} Reynold's number was obtained. It was found to be linear with the initial film thickness as a parameter. The velocity profiles obtained were similar in shape to those measured experimentally by Nedderman; however, it was impossible to <b>duplicate</b> <b>film</b> thickness profiles obtained experimentally by Ryan-Bell.

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{two methods}} of enhancing a photographic image and applies them to duplicating mammographs. Subtractive unsharp masking, one such method, is a photo-optical edge enhancement technique. The degree of unsharpness {{is controlled by}} interspacing between the mammograph and a receiving film while exposing.

50|$|The {{embossing}} {{process can}} be carried out with a simple heated press. The bottom layer of the <b>duplicating</b> <b>film</b> (the thermoplastic layer) is heated above its softening point and pressed against the stamper, so that it takes up its shape. This shape is retained when the film is cooled and removed from the press. In order to permit the viewing of embossed holograms in reflection, an additional reflecting layer of aluminum is usually added on the hologram recording layer. This method is particularly suited to mass production.|$|R
50|$|Scratches, abrasions, cinch marks {{caused by}} {{rewinding}} a film too tightly, and other blemishes {{are a common}} problem with films that are candidates for restoration. Most of these scratches are in {{the back side of}} the film in the transparent substrate that forms the film base, rather than in the photographic emulsion on the front that holds the film's actual image. In the normal process of <b>duplicating</b> a <b>film</b> in an optical printer, collimated light passes through the film base on its way to illuminate the emulsion. Any scratches, abrasions, etc., in the film base cause the light to bend such that the <b>duplicated</b> <b>film</b> ends up with bright or dark (depending on whether copying from a negative or positive original) copies of the scratches. This bending of the light is being caused by the difference in the refraction index of the substrate and the air.|$|R

40|$|THE LAST SIX YEARS {{have marked}} a trend to convert 16 mm films to video programs. The {{movement}} {{got its start}} {{with the introduction of}} efficient and moderately priced videotape recorders in the mid- 1960 s. The abun-dance of federal funds enabled many school districts to purchase video-tape recorders and film chains. (A film chain transmits the visual and sound images from a film to a video system. The images can be transmitted through a distribution network or they may be recorded on tape.) Al-though video equipment is more expensive than motion picture projectors, it is superior to projectors in terms of flexibility and ease of operation. Programs can be duplicated easily to meet peak demands. Video cassette machines are also easier to operate than projectors, making the materials more accessible to children and to adults who are intimidated by pro-jectors. Prerecorded videotapes are also much cheaper than 16 mm films (Time-Life Multimedia recently reduced the price of video cassettes to one-half the price of 16 mm films. Other firms can be expected to follow this trend.) Videotapes are much easier to maintain than films and they have a longer useful life. With all of these advantages, {{it is not surprising that}} libraries are buying video equipment and seeking licenses to <b>duplicate</b> <b>films</b> onto tape. Donald C. Hess was the pioneer promoter of purchasing licenses to <b>duplicate</b> <b>films</b> onto tape. 1 In August 1972, he began seeking information about licenses to copy films.
