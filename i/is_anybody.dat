The diary entry dates are several weeks behind the dates on which they appear in Punch.|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{successful}} media career, Icke wrote that 1989 {{was a time}} of considerable personal despair, and it was during this period that he said he began to feel a presence around him. He often describes how he felt it while alone in a hotel room in March 1990, and finally asked: [...] "If there <b>is</b> <b>anybody</b> here, will you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall!" [...] Days later, in a newsagent's in Ryde, he felt a force pull his feet to the ground, he wrote, and heard a voice guide him toward some books. One of them was Mind to Mind (1989) by Betty Shine, a psychic healer in Brighton. He read the book, then wrote to her requesting a consultation about his arthritis.|$|E

500|$|As {{originally}} {{written and}} shot, when Apollo (Jamie Bamber) fires on the Olympic Carrier, {{it was made}} clear that he sees people inside. [...] Moore wrote the scene {{to be strong and}} clear that the characters were making the decision to fire on the passenger liner in full awareness of the consequences to illustrate and emphasize [...] "the uncompromising nature of the show." [...] This was an [...] "enormous fight" [...] between Moore and the network, with the latter feeling this was another scene that was [...] "too dark" [...] and had the potential to turn away audiences; the network further implied that if the scene were left intact, they may have been compelled to air the episodes out of order. [...] To placate the network, Moore and Eick changed the ending of the episode and [...] "cheated"; instead, when Apollo flies by the Olympic Carrier, it is unclear whether or not there <b>is</b> <b>anybody</b> inside. [...] In a [...] "small act of defiance", visual effects supervisor Gary Hutzel snuck in small, indeterminate movement behind {{one or two of the}} Olympic Carriers windows on behalf of the production and writing teams. [...] The episode also originally ended with Helo's escape from the Cylons on Caprica; again tasked by the network to keep the episode from being [...] "too dark", Moore wrote in an additional scenePresident Roslin (Mary McDonnell) learning of the newbornupon which to end the episode on a hopeful note.|$|E

2500|$|Braham's {{struggles with}} {{alcoholism}} are {{portrayed in the}} 1999 film Topsy-Turvy, and during the run of The Mikado she was threatened with dismissal for this reason. [...] During the summer of 1886, she secretly married J. Duncan Young, previously a principal tenor with the company, and Carte soon had another reason to dismiss the actress. [...] In early 1887, shortly into the run of Ruddigore, Braham finally informed Carte {{that she was pregnant}} with her second child, a daughter, born on 6 May. This was not acceptable, particularly as the chorus sings to her prim and proper character in Ruddigore, Rose Maybud, [...] "Rose, all glowing with virgin blushes, say â€“ <b>Is</b> <b>anybody</b> going to marry you today?" [...] She shortly left the Savoy, and Geraldine Ulmar was hastily called back from America to assume the role. Braham created more of the Gilbert and Sullivan heroines than any other soprano, and she was the only English soprano to create more than one such role.|$|E

2500|$|While it has {{not been}} the norm, {{employee}} participation rights in corporate governance have existed in many specific sectors, particularly universities, and many workplaces organised as partnerships. Since the turn of the 20th century Acts such as the Port of London Act 1908, Iron and Steel Act 1967, or the Post Office Act 1977 required all workers in those specific companies had votes to elect directors on the board, meaning the UK had some of the first [...] "codetermination" [...] laws in the world. However, as many of those Acts were updated, the Companies Act 2006 today still has no general requirement for workers to vote in the general meeting to elect directors, meaning corporate governance remains monopolised by shareholding institutions or asset managers. By contrast in 16 out of 28 EU member states employees have participation rights in private companies, including the election of members of the boards of directors, and binding votes on decisions about individual employment rights, like dismissals, working time and social facilities or accommodation. At board level, UK company law in principle allows any measure of employee participation, alongside shareholders, but voluntary measures have been rare outside employee share schemes that usually carry very little voice and increase employees' financial risk. Crucially, the Companies Act 2006 section 168 defines [...] "members" [...] as those with the ability to vote out the board. Under section 112 a [...] "member" [...] <b>is</b> <b>anybody</b> who initially subscribes their name to the company memorandum, or is later entered on the members' register, and is not required to have contributed money as opposed to, for instance, work. A company could write its constitution to make [...] "employees" [...] members with voting rights under any terms it chose.|$|E
2500|$|Since its foundation, the Treaties {{sought to}} {{enable people to}} pursue their life goals in any country through free movement. Reflecting the {{economic}} nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a [...] "factor of production". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more [...] "social" [...] Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on [...] "citizenship", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic [...] "worker" [...] rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a [...] "worker" [...] <b>is</b> <b>anybody</b> who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, [...] "under the direction of another person" [...] for [...] "remuneration". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, {{so long as there}} was at least an [...] "indirect quid pro quo" [...] for the work he did. Having [...] "worker" [...] status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is [...] "any person having the nationality of a Member State" [...] (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, practically [...] "all available research finds little impact" [...] of [...] "labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers".|$|E
2500|$|Direct {{participation}} {{rights in}} UK corporations {{and other forms}} of enterprise have a long history in specific sectors. They remain today in institutions such as universities, and many workplaces organised as partnerships. Since the turn of the 20th century Acts such as the Port of London Act 1908, Iron and Steel Act 1967, or the Post Office Act 1977 required all workers in those specific companies had votes to elect directors on the board, meaning the UK had some of the first [...] "codetermination" [...] laws in the world.

The Companies Act 2006 section 168 defines only [...] "members" [...] as those with participation rights. Under section 112 a [...] "member" [...] <b>is</b> <b>anybody</b> who initially subscribes their name to the company memorandum, or is later entered on the members' register, and is not required to have contributed money as opposed to, for instance, work. Moreover, under the European Company Statute, businesses that reincorporate as a Societas Europaea may opt to follow the Directive for employee involvement. An SE may have a two-tiered board, as in German companies, where shareholders and employees elect a supervisory board that in turn appoints a management board responsible for day-to-day running of the company. Or an SE can have a one tiered board, as every UK company, and employees and shareholders may elect board members in the desired proportion. An [...] "SE" [...] can have no fewer employee participation rights than what existed before, but for a UK company, there is likely to have been no participation in any case.|$|E
