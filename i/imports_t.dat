Our data spans 1993 to 2000, during which time imported pears became more prevalent in the U. S. market. The range of monthly in-dustry-conduct-parameter magnitudes is 0. 034 to 0. 195 and is most pronounced when the fresh D’Anjou pear crop first becomes available in the earliest months of the marketing year. Possible reasons for timing of oligopoly power relate {{to the growth of}} imported pears during the latter portion of marketing year. In addition, oligopoly power may diminish during the marketing year as pears in storage decline in quality. Although agents in the agricultural marketing chain are often assumed to be price takers, there are some sectors that exhibit high levels of concentration.

40|$|The nuclear {{import of}} {{transcription}} regulatory proteins {{appears to be}} used by the cell to trigger transitions in cell cycle, morphogenesis, and transformation. We have previously observed that the rate at which SV- 40 T antigen fusion proteins containing a functional nuclear localization sequence (NLS; residues 126 - 132) are imported into the nucleus is enhanced {{in the presence of the}} casein kinase II (CK-II) site S 111 / 112. In this study purified p 34 cdc 2 kinase was used to phosphorylate T antigen proteins specifically at T 124 and kinetic measurements at the single-cell level performed to assess its effect on nuclear protein <b>import.</b> <b>T</b> 124 phosphorylation, which could be functionally simulated by a T-to-D 124 substitution, was found to reduce the maximal extent of nuclear accumulation whilst negligibly affecting the import rate.

Two alterative mechanisms were considered to explain the inhibition of nuclear <b>import</b> by <b>T</b> 124 phosphorylation: inactivation of the NLS and cytoplasmic retention, respectively. Furthermore, we speculate that in vivo T 124 phosphorylation may regulate the small but functionally significant amount of cytoplasmic SV- 40 T antigen.

In Europe, the disease was endemic in the past but the autochthonous natural life cycle of the parasite is currently completed very rarely. Recently, imported cases have increased in parallel to the increased number of migrations and international travels. The lack of specific surveillance systems for cysticercosis leads to underestimation of the epidemiological and clinical impacts. To review the available data on epidemiology and management of cysticercosis in Europe. A review of literature on human cysticercosis and T. solium taeniasis in Europe published between 1990 - 2011 was conducted. Out of 846 cysticercosis cases described in the literature, 522 cases were autochthonous and 324 cases were imported. The majority (70. 1 %) of the autochthonous cases were diagnosed in Portugal from 1983 and 1994. Imported cases of which 242 (74. 7 %) diagnosed in migrants and 57 (17. 6 %) in European travellers, showed an increasing trend. Most of imported cases were acquired in Latin America (69. 8 % of migrants and 44. 0 % of travellers). The majority of imported cases were diagnosed in Spain (47. 5 %), France (16. 7 %) and Italy (8. 3 %).

Thermal activity thresholds (CTmin, chill coma and chill coma recovery) were significantly lower in B. t. audax than B. t. dalmatinus.

40|$|All of the {{mitochondrial}} tRNAs of Trypanosoma brucei {{have been}} shown to be encoded in the nucleus and must be imported into the mitochondrion. The import of nuclearly encoded tRNAs into the mitochondrion has been demonstrated in a variety of organisms and is essential for proper function in the mitochondrion. An in vitro import assay has been developed to study the pathway of tRNA <b>import</b> in <b>T.</b> brucei. The in vitro system utilizes crude isolated trypanosome mitochondria and synthetic RNAs transcribed from a cloned nucleus-encoded tRNA gene cluster. The substrate, composed of tRNASer and tRNALeu, is transcribed in tandem with a 59 -nucleotide intergenic region. The tandem tRNA substrate is imported rapidly, while the mature-size tRNALeu fails to be imported in this system. These results suggest that the preferred substrate for tRNA import into trypanosome mitochondria is a precursor molecule composed of tandemly linked tRNAs. Import of the tandem tRNA substrate requires (i) a protein component that is associated with the surface of the mitochondrion, (ii) ATP pools both outside and within the mitochondrion, and (iii) a membrane potential. Dissipation of the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane by treatment with an uncoupling agent inhibits import of the tandem tRNA substrate. Characterization of the import requirements indicates that mitochondrial RNA import proceeds by a pathway including a protein component associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane, ATP-dependent steps, and a mitochondrial membrane potential...|$|R

Scented Geranium (Pelargonium sp.) was grown successfully in Kashmir. Experiments conducted at RRL Field Station Bonera Pulwama revealed that the morphological characters, growth behaviour, herbage and oil yield/ha were more or less similar to the hilly areas of South India. The aerial parts (Fresh flowers, stalks and leaves) on steam distillation yielded an essential oil 0. 15 % on fresh wt. basis. Fifty three chemical constituents representing > 96 % of the oil were identified by GC and GC-Mass analysis. Major constituents were citronellol (25. 55 %), geraniol (20. 81 %), citronellyl formate (8. 04 %) and isomenthone (7. 59 %). Linalool content was comparatively higher (11. 94 %) as compared to South Indian oil (6. 7 %). It is quite evident from the analysis that the oil produced under Kashmir conditions is quite competitive to best geranium oil produced in South India. Moreover the odour and evaluation studies by a leading perfumer has found that the oil is highly acceptable to the user industry...|$|R
40|$|SummaryInteractions with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) {{interrupt}} T cell migration through {{tissues and}} trigger signaling pathways that converge on the activation of transcriptional regulators, including nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which control T cell function and differentiation. Both stable and unstable modes of cognate T cell-APC interactions {{have been observed}} in vivo, but the functional significance of unstable, serial contacts has remained unclear. Here we used multiphoton intravital microscopy in lymph nodes and tumors to show that while NFAT nuclear <b>import</b> was fast (<b>t</b> 1 / 2 max∼ 1  min), nuclear export was slow (t 1 / 2 ∼ 20  min) in T cells. During delayed export, nuclear NFAT constituted a short-term imprint of transient TCR signals and remained transcriptionally active for the T cell tolerance gene Egr 2, {{but not for the}} effector gene Ifng, which required continuous TCR triggering for expression. This provides a potential mechanistic basis for the observation that a predominance of unstable APC interactions correlates with the induction of T cell tolerance...|$|R
