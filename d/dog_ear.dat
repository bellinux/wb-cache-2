5|$|The {{concert in}} Cologne was {{recorded}} and released as an album titled Symphonic Odysseys by <b>Dog</b> <b>Ear</b> Records, Nobuo Uematsu's recording label. It was announced {{to be in}} production on October 26, 2011, and released on December 28, 2011. The artwork for the album features {{a cross between a}} sword and a violin on a white background, in the vein of the Symphonic Fantasies album, which had a cross between a violin and a game controller. The cover art was produced by German design house Schech, who earlier provided the artwork for the European release of Symphonic Fantasies. Accompanying the CD is a booklet which contains photos of the concert and discusses the arrangers and compositions included in each song. The album contains everything played at the concert, with the Final Fantasy suite split into three tracks, and the album is split at the intermission into two CDs. Its fourteen tracks have a duration of 1:34:56. While <b>Dog</b> <b>Ear</b> Records published the album in Japan, the album was released in Europe through the online music retailer MAZ-Sound.|$|E
5|$|Uematsu, a self-taught musician, {{began playing}} the piano {{at the age of}} twelve, with English singer-songwriter Elton John as his biggest influence. Uematsu joined Square in 1986, where he first met Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The two later worked {{together}} on many titles at the company, most notably in the Final Fantasy series. After nearly two decades with Square, Uematsu left in 2004 to create his own production company, which included the <b>Dog</b> <b>Ear</b> Records music label. He has since composed music as a freelancer for other games, including ones developed by Square Enix and Sakaguchi's development studio, Mistwalker.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert was}} {{initially}} {{scheduled for a}} single performance, but after selling out within twelve hours a second concert was added prior in the same day in Cologne. This too sold out, {{resulting in a total}} attendance of over 4000. A third performance was held almost six years later on June 18, 2017 in Paris, and a fourth just after on June 20, 2017 in London. A recording of the concert was published as a two-disc album on December 28, 2011 by <b>Dog</b> <b>Ear</b> Records, Uematsu's own record label. The albums, along with the concerts themselves, received varied reviews, with some critics giving enthusiastic praise, especially in regards {{to the quality of the}} performance, the choice of source material, and the quality of the arrangements, while other critics greatly disliked several of the arrangements.|$|E

5|$|Uematsu left Square Enix in 2004 {{and formed}} his own {{production}} company, Smile Please. He later founded the music production company and record label <b>Dog</b> <b>Ear</b> Records in 2006. The reason for Uematsu's departure {{was that the}} company moved their office from Meguro to Shinjuku, Tokyo, {{and he was not}} comfortable with the new location. Also, he cites {{the fact that he had}} reached an age where he should gradually take his life into his own hands. He does, however, continue to compose music as a freelancer for Square Enix. In 2005, Uematsu and several members of The Black Mages created the score for the CGI film Final Fantasy VII Advent Children. Uematsu composed only the main theme for Final Fantasy XII (2006); he was originally offered the job of creating the full score, but Sakimoto was eventually assigned as the main composer instead. Uematsu was also initially going to create the theme song for Final Fantasy XIII (2010). However, after being assigned the task of creating the entire score of Final Fantasy XIV, Uematsu decided to hand the job over to the main Final Fantasy XIII composer, Hamauzu.|$|E

25|$|<b>Dog</b> <b>ear</b> is {{a casing}} type with {{extensions}} at {{both sides of}} pickup. These are extensions of the predominantly rectangular cover, that encompass the outlying mounting screws. Dog-ear P-90 pickups were commonly mounted on Gibson's hollow-body guitars like the ES-330 and occasionally on solid-body models like the Les Paul Junior. The same pickups were also available on Epiphone models (since Gibson was building Epiphone guitars in the 1950s) and the design is best remembered for its appearance on the hollow body Epiphone Casino of {{the mid to late}} 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} and most basic method of holding the work is a planing stop or <b>dog</b> <b>ear,</b> which is simply a peg or small piece of wood or metal that stands just above the surface {{at the end of the}} bench top. The work is placed on the bench with the end pushed against the stop. The force of the planing keeps the board in place, so long as the force is always toward the stop. Planing against a stop gives the woodworker good {{feedback}} - he can tell a lot about what is going on just by the pressure, force and balance required. A stop can take the form of a batten attached to the end of the bench, or it can be adjustable, able to be moved up and down according to the size of the work - or pushed down below the surface when not needed. A simple bench dog can serve as a planing stop.|$|E
500|$|The Black Mages III: Darkness and Starlight is {{the third}} {{arranged}} soundtrack album of video game music from the Final Fantasy series of role-playing video games. The album contains a selection of musical tracks from the games, arranged and performed in a hybrid of hard rock and progressive metal by The Black Mages {{in a similar manner}} to their previous albums. It was released on March 19, 2008, by Uematsu's <b>Dog</b> <b>Ear</b> Records, spanning ten tracks and a duration of 60:40. The Black Mages sing the chorus for the song [...] "Darkness and Starlight", the only vocal track on the album. The album has been described as being composed of a mix of [...] "intense" [...] symphonic metal pieces and rock opera. Like the previous album, Darkness and Starlight features an original piece, [...] "Life ~in memory of KEITEN~", which was composed by Uematsu for Yoshitaka Tagawa, a boy he had met who died of leukemia.|$|E

2500|$|All Gibson P-90 pickups (vintage and otherwise) were machine {{wound on}} Leesona coil winding machines, {{although}} their electrical specifications may vary slightly due to operator error. In common {{with many other}} modern pickup types, there are two versions of modern P-90: neck and bridge version. Their DC resistance tends to be around 7-8 kΩ for neck pickups and 8-9 kΩ for bridge pickups. Early P-90 pickups made before approx. 1974 were manufactured with {{no difference in the}} bridge and neck position and were interchangeable. After winding, pickups were hung on a rack holding 20 pickups and assembled according to the model of guitar they were to be used on (Soap-Bar or <b>Dog</b> <b>Ear).</b> [...] Earlier pickups (around 1952) had Alnico 3 magnets, but in 1957 Gibson switched to Alnico 5.|$|E
