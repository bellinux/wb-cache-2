5|$|Based on spectroscopy, Saturn {{is thought}} to be similar in {{composition}} to Jupiter, but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> helium and relatively more ices and are thus now termed ice giants.|$|E
5|$|Because it isn't {{as close}} to its star as its sister planets Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c, the Kepler team {{suggests}} that its light density may come from a large <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> helium atmosphere {{that has not been}} blown away by the stellar wind.|$|E

50|$|Hydrogen pinch {{analysis}} (HPA) is a hydrogen management method that originates from {{the concept of}} heat {{pinch analysis}}. HPA is a systematic technique for reducing <b>hydrogen</b> consumption <b>and</b> <b>hydrogen</b> generation through integration of hydrogen-using activities or processes in the petrochemical industry, petroleum refineries <b>hydrogen</b> distribution networks <b>and</b> <b>hydrogen</b> purification.|$|R
5|$|From this equation, pKw=14 at 24.87°C. At that {{temperature}} both <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> hydroxide ions have {{a concentration}} of 10−7M.|$|E
5|$|Ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, are {{primarily}} composed of low-boiling-point {{materials such as}} water, methane, and ammonia, with thick atmospheres of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> helium. They have a significantly lower mass than the gas giants (only 14 and 17 Earth masses).|$|E
5|$|In 1823, Michael Faraday, then an {{assistant}} in Davy's lab, successfully liquefied chlorine {{and went on}} to liquefy all known gaseous elements, except for nitrogen, <b>hydrogen,</b> <b>and</b> oxygen. Shortly after, in 1869, Irish chemist Thomas Andrews studied the phase transition from a liquid to a gas and coined the term critical point to describe the condition where a gas and a liquid were indistinguishable as phases, and Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals supplied the theoretical framework which allowed the prediction of critical behavior based on measurements at much higher temperatures. By 1908, James Dewar and Heike Kamerlingh Onnes were successfully able to liquefy <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> then newly discovered helium, respectively.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>hydrogen</b> iodide <b>and</b> <b>hydrogen</b> astatide can split {{back into}} their {{constituent}} elements.|$|R
50|$|It {{should have}} {{properties}} {{similar to that}} of <b>hydrogen</b> selenide <b>and</b> <b>hydrogen</b> telluride, other borderline hydrides. It is very unstable at room temperature and must be stored at freezer temperatures to prevent reversion to elemental polonium and hydrogen; this is because it is an endothermic compound, like the lighter <b>hydrogen</b> telluride <b>and</b> <b>hydrogen</b> selenide, <b>and</b> decomposes into its constituent elements, releasing heat in the process. The amount of heat given off in the decomposition of polonium hydride is over 100 kJ/mol, the largest of all the hydrogen chalcogenides.|$|R

5|$|In February 2016, it was {{announced}} that NASA Hubble Space Telescope had detected <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> helium (and suggestions of hydrogen cyanide), but no water vapor, in the atmosphere of 55Cancrie, the first time the atmosphere of a super-earth exoplanet was analyzed successfully.|$|E
5|$|In {{the carbon}} cycle, {{methanogen}} archaea remove <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> {{play an important}} role in the decay of organic matter by the populations of microorganisms that act as decomposers in anaerobic ecosystems, such as sediments, marshes and sewage-treatment works.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{his major}} {{interest}} was {{the theory of}} the continuous spectrum and his first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its transition probabilities. He calculated the photoelectric effect for <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> X-rays, obtaining the absorption coefficient at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that the sun was largely composed of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> that his calculations were indeed correct.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydrogen}} {{infrastructure is}} {{the infrastructure of}} hydrogen pipeline transport, points of <b>hydrogen</b> production <b>and</b> <b>hydrogen</b> stations (sometimes clustered as a hydrogen highway) for distribution {{as well as the}} sale of <b>hydrogen</b> fuel, <b>and</b> thus a crucial pre-requisite before a successful commercialization of automotive fuel cell technology.|$|R
50|$|The guided-rotor {{compressor}} {{is under}} research as a hydrogen compressor for <b>hydrogen</b> stations <b>and</b> <b>hydrogen</b> pipeline transport.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> codes <b>and</b> standards, {{as well as}} {{codes and}} {{technical}} standards for <b>hydrogen</b> safety <b>and</b> the storage of hydrogen, {{have been identified as}} an institutional barrier to deploying <b>hydrogen</b> technologies <b>and</b> developing a <b>hydrogen</b> economy. To enable the commercialization of hydrogen in consumer products, new codes and standards must be developed and adopted by federal, state and local governments.|$|R
5|$|Like most astronomical objects, NGC 6543 {{consists}} {{mostly of}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> helium, with heavier elements present in small quantities.

5|$|Massive {{stars in}} these groups may powerfully {{illuminate}} those clouds, ionizing the <b>hydrogen,</b> <b>and</b> creating H II regions. Such feedback effects, from star formation, may ultimately disrupt the cloud and prevent further star formation.|$|E
5|$|The Kepler {{team has}} said that Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c are {{probably}} composed mostly of water with a thin <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> helium atmosphere. In comparison to the outer planets of the system, which probably have large <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> helium atmospheres, Kepler-11c's proximity to its star has blown off most of its atmosphere. Kepler-11 and its six-planet system form what NASA considers {{to be the most}} compact and flattest planetary system yet discovered. Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c orbit Kepler-11 with a phenomenon called orbital resonance, a gravitational tugging that keeps their orbit stable at a 5.4 ratio.|$|E
50|$|The {{conjugate}} base HP(O)2(OH)− is called <b>hydrogen</b> phosphite, <b>and</b> the second {{conjugate base}}, , is the phosphite ion. (Note that the IUPAC recommendations are <b>hydrogen</b> phosphonate <b>and</b> phosphonate respectively).|$|R
50|$|Cp′ {{can be used}} {{to probe}} the {{structure}} of organometallic complexes. For example, Cp′Fe(PPh3)(CO)I has four different signals in the 1H-NMR spectrum for the ring <b>hydrogens</b> <b>and</b> five different signals in the 13C-NMR spectrum for the ring carbons. There is therefore no symmetry within the ring even accounting for rotation around the ring-metal axis, but instead there is a diastereotopic relationship as a result of being part of a chiral complex. The achiral precursor complex Cp'Fe(CO)2I has only two signals for those <b>hydrogens</b> <b>and</b> three for those carbons, indicating a symmetric structure.|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{cold work}} on {{hydrogen}} diffusivity, <b>hydrogen</b> concentration <b>and</b> <b>hydrogen</b> trap density in AISI 430 stainless steel were investigated. <b>Hydrogen</b> concentration <b>and</b> trap density were increased with increasing cold work, but diffusivity was decreased. The increase in trap density {{as a result}} of cold work was responsible for the decrease in <b>hydrogen</b> diffusivity <b>and</b> the increase in hydrogen concentration. Trap densities varied from 10 (21) cm(- 3) for the cold-worked specimen to 10 (17) cm(- 3) for the annealed. The cold-worked steel was more sensitive to hydrogen-induced blistering due to its higher <b>hydrogen</b> concentration <b>and</b> trap density, but no blistering was found on annealed specimens.

5|$|The {{presence}} of {{large quantities of}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> helium on Kepler-11d, Kepler-11e, and Kepler-11f suggest that these planets formed within the first few million years of the system's existence, when gas could still be captured from the forming protoplanetary disc.|$|E
5|$|Where the {{pressure}} is 33±5 millibars, the atmosphere is clear (probably <b>hydrogen)</b> <b>and</b> its Rayleigh effect is detectable. At that pressure the temperature is 2200±260 K.|$|E
5|$|All heavier {{elements}} (including those {{necessary for}} rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were {{hot enough to}} fuse helium itself. All elements other than <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> helium today account for only 2% {{of the mass of}} atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|All of the Solar System planets except Mercury have {{substantial}} atmospheres because their gravity {{is strong enough}} to keep gases close to the surface. The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> helium, whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space. The composition of Earth's atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Although both <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> helium {{are in the}} s-block, {{neither of}} them behaves {{similarly}} to other s-block elements. Their behaviour is {{so different from the}} other s-block elements that there is considerable disagreement over where these two elements should be placed in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the stars}} lies the {{interstellar}} medium, {{a region of}} sparse matter. In the densest regions, molecular clouds of molecular <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the Jeans length) to form compact protostars.|$|E
