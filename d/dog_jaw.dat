30|$|Jaws in 10 male beagle {{dogs were}} divided into four groups, and 36 dental {{implants}} were inserted into the jaws. In groups 1 and 2, experimental peri-implantitis was induced within 2  months after implant insertion. In group 1, surface decontamination of implants was achieved using air-flow and citric acid. In group 2, implants were sterilized with autoclave after air-flow and citric acid surface decontamination. Subsequently, these implants were inserted in contralateral jaws of the same dogs and a 3 -month period was allowed for osseointegration. In group 3, the implants were removed from human jaws due to peri-implantitis and were inserted into <b>dog</b> <b>jaws</b> following surface cleaning protocol and sterilization with autoclave and a 3 -month period was allowed for osseointegration. Group 4 was set as the control group. After the osseointegration period, all the animals were sacrificed. The degree of osseointegration in all groups was evaluated by evaluating the ISQ values and by using histomorphometric measurements.|$|R
30|$|Levin et al. {{conducted}} {{a similar study}} and investigated the success rate of retrieved dental implants that were re-implanted into dogs. The infected implants were re-implanted into <b>dog</b> <b>jaws</b> without any chemical or mechanical cleaning and the authors reported {{that there was no}} difference in terms of BIC percentage between the infected/reinserted and new dental implants after an appropriate healing period [21]. In our study, the experimental groups were formed in line with the literature; in group 1, a highly effective decontamination method (APA and citric acid) was used [22], whereas in groups 2 and 3, autoclave sterilization was used for the decontamination of implant surfaces since autoclave is the most common method for the sterilization of surgical instruments and is widely used in dental implant laboratory studies [23]. After the experiment, it was revealed that autoclave sterilization does not interfere with osseointegration, which implicates that autoclave sterilization is a useful method to be used in re-implantation procedures.|$|R
60|$|Lambing-time came late in May, and Mescal, Wolf, Piute and Jack knew no rest. Night-time was {{safer for}} the sheep than the day, though the howling of a {{thousand}} coyotes made it hideous for the shepherds. All in a day, seemingly, the little fleecy lambs came, as if by magic, and filled the forest with piping bleats. Then they were tottering after their mothers, gamboling at a day's growth, wilful as youth--and the carnage began. Boldly the coyotes darted out of thicket and bush, and many lambs never returned to their mothers. Gaunt shadows hovered always near; the great timber-wolves waited in covert for prey. Piute slept not at all, and the <b>dog's</b> <b>jaws</b> were flecked with blood morning and night. Jack hung up fifty-four coyotes the second day; the third he let them lie, seventy in number. Many times the rifle-barrel burned his hands. His aim grew unerring, so that running brutes in range dropped in their tracks. Many a gray coyote fell with a lamb in his teeth.|$|R

It took a while to regain his form and confidence, but it soon returned, and on the night of the Christmas party, he slept with Cindi Marshall, not knowing she was Gavin Moody's girlfriend. On Gavin's stag trip, Ryan confesses to Gavin, but Gavin is upset and shoots dead Ryan's beloved pet <b>dog,</b> <b>Jaws,</b> sparking a feud between the two players which spills out onto the pitch in the FA Cup quarter final game, getting both players sent off. Ryan is banned for the replay, and at his lowest point goes up to the top of the stadium where Clyde killed himself and thinks about jumping before getting stopped. He left the club for Villarreal CF after punching Gavin as part of a match fixing scandal. He later reappeared on the final day of the season 2006-07 as a TV pundit, where Harchester won the Premier League after beating Chelsea 2-1, but the fate of the team, stadium, fans and Ryan himself was left ambiguous as a stand was set on fire after a cigarette was dropped into petrol left from Ex-Captain Danny Sullivan's planned revenge on the club.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are cases}} (Gineste et al. 1999; de Bruijn et al. 1994; Cleries et al. 2000 b), in which the {{biodegradation}} kinetics of calcium orthophosphate coatings, films and layers appeared to be correlated imperfectly with their solubility values (see Table[*] 1). For example, three types of calcium orthophosphate (HA, ACP and β-TCP) coatings on titanium alloy substrates, deposited by the laser ablation technique, were immersed in SBF {{in order to determine}} their behavior in conditions similar to the human blood plasma. Neither HA nor ACP coatings were found to dissolve in SBF, while a β-TCP coating slightly dissolved. Precipitation of an apatitic phase was favored onto both HA and β-TCP coatings; however, no precipitation occurred onto ACP coating (Cleries et al. 2000 b). Additionally, degradation rates of dental implants with 50 - and 100 -micron thick coatings of HA, FA and fluorhydroxylapatite (FHA) were studied (Gineste et al. 1999). The implants were inserted in <b>dog</b> <b>jaws</b> and retrieved for histological analysis after 3, 6, and 12 [*]months. The thickness of the calcium orthophosphate coatings was evaluated using an image analysis device. HA and FA coatings (even at 100 -micron thickness) were almost totally degraded within the implantation period. In contrast, the FHA coatings did not show significant degradation during the same period (Gineste et al. 1999).|$|R

60|$|The {{smoothness}} {{and wide}} {{extent of the}} plain, the bulk of matter deposited, and the obscure traces of stratification {{seem to indicate that}} the loam was deposited under water; on the other hand, the presence of sea-shells, their broken state, the pebbles of various sizes, and the artificial floor of round stones, almost prove that it must have originated in a rush of water from the sea over the land. The height of the plain, namely, 120 feet, renders it improbable that an earthquake-wave, vast as some have here been, could have broken over the surface at its present level; but when the land stood eighty-five feet lower, at the period when the shells were thrown up on the ledge at S. Lorenzo, and when as we know man inhabited this district, such an event might well have occurred; and if we may further suppose, that the plain was at that time converted into a temporary lake, as actually occurred, during the earthquakes of 1713 and 1746, {{in the case of the}} low land round Callao owing to its being encircled by a high shingle-beach, all the appearances above described will be perfectly explained. I must add, that at a lower level near the point where the present low land round Callao joins the higher plain, there are appearances of two distinct deposits both apparently formed by debacles: in the upper one, a horse's tooth and a <b>dog's</b> <b>jaw</b> were embedded; so that both must have been formed after the settlement of the Spaniards: according to Acosta, the earthquake-wave of 1586 rose eighty-four feet.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present the {{decalcification}} process dynamic of mineralized tissue in <b>dogs,</b> teeth and <b>jaw,</b> comparing the traditional decalcification method, immersion, and microwave, immersion followed by irradiation using a domestic microwave oven, accompanying the liberation of calcium through spectrophotometer of atomic absorption. It was used as decalcified agent, EDTA solution or nitric acid. The results showed that with the use of nitric acid (5 %), after 15 days, the irradiated fragments could be processed for histological analysis, otherwise the tooth not irradiated need to be submerged for 65 days. The EDTA decalcified action was slower than the nitric acid. The histological observations of the irradiated samples showed an excellent preservation of the morphological characteristics, independently of the decalcified agent used. © 2007 Sociedad Chilena de Anatomía...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} use the badger's ability to defend itself to test the dog, {{artificial}} badger dens were built, captured badgers were put in them and then the dog was set on the badger. The badger would {{be placed in a}} box, which was furnished in imitation of its den and from there a tunnel led upward. The owner of the badger puts his animal in the box. The timekeeper is equipped with a watch and the badger's owner releases the dog for the fight. Whoever wants to pit his dog against the badger lets it slide into the tunnel. Usually the dog is seized immediately by the badger and the dog in turn grips the badger. Each bites, tears and pulls the other with all their might. The owner of the dog quickly pulls out the <b>dog</b> whose <b>jaws</b> are clamped obstinately onto the badger by its tail. The two are separated and the badger is returned to its den.
