5|$|GCC {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} lobbyist groups against action to mitigate global warming.

5|$|Since 2009, the IFC {{has focused}} {{on a set of}} {{development}} goals that its projects are expected to target.

5|$|The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) (1989–2001) was an {{international}} lobbyist group of businesses that opposed action to reduce {{greenhouse gas emissions}} and challenged the science behind global warming. The GCC was the largest industry group active <b>in</b> <b>climate</b> policy and the most prominent industry advocate in international climate negotiations. The GCC was involved {{in opposition to the}} Kyoto Protocol, and played a role in blocking ratification by the United States. The coalition promoted the views of climate skeptics. The GCC dissolved in 2001 after membership declined in the face of improved understanding of the role of greenhouse gases <b>in</b> <b>climate</b> change and of public criticism.|$|E

5000|$|Kaolinite clay {{occurs in}} {{abundance}} in soils that have formed from the chemical weathering of rocks in hot, moist climates—for example in tropical rainforest areas. Comparing soils along a gradient towards progressively cooler or drier climates, {{the proportion of}} kaolinite decreases, while the proportion of other clay minerals such as illite (<b>in</b> cooler <b>climates)</b> or smectite (<b>in</b> drier <b>climates)</b> increases. Such climatically-related differences in clay mineral content are often used to infer changes <b>in</b> <b>climates</b> <b>in</b> the geological past, where ancient soils have been buried and preserved.|$|R

5|$|Albert Arnold Gore Jr. (born March 31, 1948) is an American {{politician}} and environmentalist {{who served as}} the 45th Vice President of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Gore was Bill Clinton's running mate in their successful campaign in 1992, and the pair were re-elected in 1996. Near the end of President Clinton's second term, Gore was selected as the Democratic nominee for the 2000 presidential election but did not win the election. After his term as vice-president ended in 2001, Gore remained prominent as an author and environmental activist, whose work <b>in</b> <b>climate</b> change activism earned him (jointly with the IPCC) the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Beetle fossils are {{abundant}} in the Cenozoic; by the Quaternary (up to 1.6 mya), fossil species are identical to living ones, while from the Late Miocene (5.7 mya) the fossils are still so close to modern forms that they are most likely the ancestors of living species. The large oscillations <b>in</b> <b>climate</b> during the Quaternary caused beetles to change their geographic distributions so much that current location gives little clue to the biogeographical history of a species. It is evident that geographic isolation of populations must often have been broken as insects moved {{under the influence of}} changing climate, causing mixing of gene pools, rapid evolution, and extinctions, especially in middle latitudes.|$|E

5|$|Colors {{accepted}} by the breed registry include chestnut, bay and seal brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with pangaré markings). Bays with white markings are the most popular. Norman Cobs are known as calm, willing horses with strong personalities. The breed's Thoroughbred ancestry gives them energy and athleticism, and makes them mature faster than other draft breeds. They show great endurance when ridden, and are relatively hardy, accepting outdoor living and changes <b>in</b> <b>climate.</b> Traditionally the Norman Cob had its tail docked, a practice that continued until January 1996, when the practice became illegal in France.|$|E
5|$|Despite ongoing {{financial}} difficulties, Cerna {{graduated from}} university in 1906. His thesis was passed with a Magna cum laude qualifier. He was by then seriously ill with tuberculosis, and sought a change <b>in</b> <b>climate.</b> Cerna {{spent much of}} this period traveling through the Old Kingdom, and several times visited regions of the Southern Carpathians, in particular the area of Rucăr, the Bucegi Mountains, and the Jiu Valley. As Călinescu notes, he had bought himself a horse from a Rucăr local on credit, and failed to deliver the promised sum on time.|$|E
5|$|Eyre {{returned}} to Britain, arriving at Spithead on 10 December 1826, and was almost immediately offered command of a squadron fitting out for Lisbon. The changes <b>in</b> <b>climate</b> had brought on {{an attack of}} gout, and on being informed that as Sir Thomas Hardy's squadron {{was already on the}} spot, he was at liberty to refuse the offer. Eyre did so, and retired ashore. He appears to have had no further commands, and was advanced to vice-admiral in 1830. He had married Georgiana Cooke, the daughter of Sir George Cooke, 7th Baronet, at Doncaster on 1 November 1800, with whom he had a family of eight children, including two sons named George-Hardolf and William. Sir George Eyre died on 15 February 1839 at the rectory, Carlton, Derbyshire.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the area}} resembles Pennsylvania <b>in</b> <b>climate,</b> {{vegetation}} and wildlife. The park is near the southern limit for eastern hemlock and eastern white pine. Coves in the area vary by elevation and topography, with second-growth oak and hickory more common in lower-lying areas. The surrounding forests contain rich, high-altitude flora including rare wildflowers and ferns, such as Persistent Trillium, which grows near Rhododendron. Nearby boulderfields by Blood Mountain include Dutchman's breeches, squirrel corn, waterleaf and other herbaceous plants.|$|E
5|$|The Cascade Range is {{dramatically}} different <b>in</b> <b>climate</b> from west to east. The west side is heavily forested and features trees such as Douglas firs, western hemlock, Pacific silver firs, and Alaska yellow cedars. East of the Cascades, where Yamsay lies, the climate becomes much drier, even arid. Precipitation significantly declines and vegetation becomes more sparse, with lodgepole pine, white fir, ponderosa pine, and juniper. To the south, chaparral {{plants such as}} beargrass and bitterbrush prevail.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} conditions have been significantly altered {{from the original}} conditions {{by the presence of}} life-forms, which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations <b>in</b> <b>climate</b> by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods, and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} Level Mountain is {{influenced}} by the presence of the Coast Mountains to the west, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Nahlin Plateau, casting a rain shadow over Level Mountain. Because the massif has a gently sloping and flat profile, it has subtle differences <b>in</b> <b>climate,</b> particularly at the low to upper-mid elevations. Hence a relatively homogeneous climate extends over Level Mountain, with only gradual temperatures and precipitation gradients occurring altitudinally. Therefore, large mammals do not have a wide diversity of local climates from which to choose.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} climate change on teleosts could be {{powerful}} but are complex. For example, increased winter precipitation (rain and snow) could harm populations of freshwater fish in Norway, whereas warmer summers could increase growth of adult fish. In the oceans, teleosts may be able to cope with warming, as it is simply an extension of natural variation <b>in</b> <b>climate.</b> It is uncertain how ocean acidification, caused by rising carbon dioxide levels, might affect teleosts.|$|E
5|$|The survey {{continued}} {{to the south}} in Patagonia.
