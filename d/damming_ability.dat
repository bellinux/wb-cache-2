25|$|In 1909, {{engineers}} for Great Falls Power Co. proposed building dams at Rainbow Falls (Rainbow Dam) and the Great Falls (Ryan Dam), {{and a third}} dam (Cochrane Dam) {{between the}} other two in a canyon of the Missouri River. In 1914, Montana Power considered raising the height of Black Eagle Dam to increase its power generation capacity. In 1916, much of the Boston and Montana smelter plant {{was replaced by a}} modern copper and zinc smelter, and a wire and cable manufacturing plant was added. But Black Eagle Dam, even with upgrades to its turbines and other power generation equipment, still only generated about three MW of electricity. More power was required. By the early 1920s, the needs of the city of Great Falls had outstripped Black Eagle <b>Dam's</b> <b>ability</b> to generate electricity, and the smelter was planning a new electrolytic zinc manufacturing plant that would require 10 MW of power. By 1925, the north powerhouses were seriously outdated.|$|R
5000|$|In late May 2003, over Memorial Day weekend, {{heavy rains}} caused the {{embankment}} dam {{to give way}} and also destroyed 30 ft of the nearby Lakeview Road. About 40 homes and 1600 people downstream were evacuated as water from Hope Mills Lake rushed down the creek causing $2.1 million in damages before making {{its way to the}} Cape Fear River. One of the floodgates on the dam had failed to open because of the pressure exerted by the flood waters, which helped push water {{over the top of the}} dam. Later in 2003, Lakeview Road was repaired and plans for the repair of the dam were underway. After four years of fund and permit requests, construction on the new 14 million dollar Hope Mills Dam began in March 2007. [...] Crowder Construction Company was awarded the contract to construct the dam along with designs from Mactec, Morrison Engineers. The new dam would essentially be a concrete labyrinth-spillway that would expand the <b>dam's</b> <b>ability</b> to discharge flood waters. The new dam would be 600 ft longer and would incorporate a fish ladder as well. Construction of the new Hope Mills Dam was complete in June 2008 and the lake was again full by August.|$|R

[...] The dam supported a bridge on Scotch Bush Road which therefore involved the County of Renfrew. In 2012 and 2013, modifications {{were made to the}} dam and bridge structure to separate the two. Cost for the project was shared between the Ministry of Natural Resources and the County of Renfrew. This project was undertaken because the aging nature {{of the structure of the}} dam. The freeze and thaw cycles could no longer be contained within the 90-year-old concrete. Concerns about the <b>dam's</b> <b>ability</b> to control floods were cited by the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), owner of the Balaclava Dam, and owner of over three-hundred other dams in the Province of Ontario. Further, the MNR cited it needed to be in compliance with requirements of subsection 35(2) of the Fisheries Act. This involved decommissioning Balaclava dam and the roadway above it, removing old structures, building a new and larger dam which was accomplished in 2013. The deed to the local area {{was purchased}} in the late 1980s by Michael Huneault, and is now in possession of Wendy Huneault.

40|$|Breastfeeding {{improves}} {{maternal and}} child health. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with continued breastfeeding {{for at least}} one year. However, in the US, only 18. 8 % of infants are exclusively breastfed until six months of age. For mothers who initiate breastfeeding, the early postpartum period sets the stage for sustained breastfeeding. Mothers who experience breastfeeding problems in the early postpartum period are more likely to discontinue breastfeeding within two weeks. A major risk factor for shorter breastfeeding duration is delayed lactogenesis II (i. e. onset of milk coming in more than 72 h postpartum). Recent studies report a metabolic-hormonal link to delayed lactogenesis II. This is not surprising because around the time of birth the mother’s entire metabolism changes to direct nutrients to mammary glands. Circadian and metabolic systems are closely linked, and our rodent studies suggest circadian clocks coordinate hormonal and metabolic changes to support lactation. Molecular and environmental disruption of the circadian system decreases a <b>dam’s</b> <b>ability</b> to initiate lactation and negatively impacts milk production. Circadian and metabolic systems evolved to be functional and adaptive when lifestyles and environmental exposures were quite different from modern times. We now have artificial lights, longer work days, and increases in shift work. Disruption in the circadian system due to shift work, jet lag, sleep disorders and other modern life style choices are associated with metabolic disorders, obesity, and impaired reproduction. We hypothesize delayed lactogenesis II is related to disruption of the mother’s circadian system. Here we review literature that supports this hypothesis, and describe interventions that may help to increase breastfeeding success...|$|R

40|$|The “interpretation through synthesis”, i. e. Active Ap-pearance Models (AAMs) method, has {{received}} consider-able attention {{over the past}} decades. It aims at “explain-ing ” face images by synthesizing them via a parameter-ized model of appearance. It is quite challenging due to appearance variations of human face images, e. g. facial poses, occlusions, lighting, low resolution, etc. Since these variations are mostly non-linear, {{it is impossible to}} repre-sent them in a linear model, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper presents a novel Deep Appear-ance Models (DAMs) approach, an efficient replacement for AAMs, to accurately capture both shape and texture of face images under large variations. In this approach, three crucial components represented in hierarchical layers are modeled using the Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM) to ro-bustly capture the variations of facial shapes and appear-ances. DAMs are therefore superior to AAMs in inferring a representation for new face images under various challeng-ing conditions. In addition, <b>DAMs</b> have <b>ability</b> to generate a compact set of parameters in higher level representation {{that can be used for}} classification, e. g. face recognition and facial age estimation. The proposed approach is evaluated in facial image reconstruction, facial super-resolution on two databases, i. e. LFPW and Helen.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide a better understanding of suffusion characteristics of glacial soils and to present a simple yet reliable assessment procedure for determination of suffusion in the laboratory. Internal erosion by suffusion occurs in the core of an embankment <b>dam</b> when the <b>ability</b> of the soil to resist seepage forces is exceeded and voids are large enough to allow the transport of fine particles through the pores. Soils susceptible to suffusion are described as internally unstable. dams with core of broadly graded glacial moraines (tills) exhibit signs of internal erosion to a larger extent than dams constructed with other types of materials. The Suffusion behavior of glacial soils has been investigated through two different permeameter suffusion test have been employed, small scale permeameter and big scale permeameter. Details of the equipment along with its calibration, testing and sampling procedures are provided. The testing program were performed 9 test with different compaction degree in small scale permeameter and 2 test in big permeameter on internally stable categories of till soil. The categories are defined based on the soil grain size distribution and according to the methods developed by Kenney & Lau and Burenkova. Layers are identified with suffusion if the post-test gradation curve exhibit changes in distribution compared to the initial condition and also the tests revealed that the effect of grain size distribution and relative degree of compaction on the internal erosion susceptibility of glacial till soils at different hydraulic gradient...|$|R
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityDystocia {{is a major problem}} in the dairy industry as it causes livestock and economic loss. It is more frequently seen in primiparous cattle compared to their multiparous counterparts due to their smaller stature and the slow maturation of pelvic dimensions. In some instances, human intervention of the parturition process is imperative to avoid pain, injury, and mortality of the neonate and the <b>dam.</b> The <b>ability</b> to accurately predict dystocia and the time of parturition will ensure that timely assistance can be given to animals that are of high risk of dystocia. The present thesis contains four studies that explore methods to predict dystocia and the time of parturition as well as factors that influence the presentation and outcome of cesarean sections. The first study, presented in chapter three, evaluated the clinical utility of measuring the circumference of the calf front and maternal intrapelvic dimensions to predict the incidence of dystocia in late gestation Holstein-Friesian cattle. The ratio of the calf hoof circumference to the maternal intrapelvic area was identified to have clinical utility in predicting the calving difficulty score. The second study, presented in chapter four, assessed the changes in plasma progesterone concentration, rectal temperature, sacrosciatic ligament relaxation, and feed intake to predict the time of parturition in dairy cattle. Results indicated that plasma progesterone concentration had the highest accuracy in predicting the time of parturition. The third study, presented in chapter five, explored the clinical utility of blood and plasma glucose concentrations in predicting parturition as well as their relationship with hypercortisolemia and clinical signs associated with the activation of the sympathetic nervous system namely heart rate, respiratory rate, mean arterial blood pressure, hematocrit, and rumen contraction rate. Blood glucose was determined to have the potential to predict parturition due to its accuracy, practicality, and cost effectiveness. In the fourth study, presented in chapter six, a retrospective study was conducted to examine the clinical presentations and outcomes of beef cattle that were admitted into a teaching hospital with dystocia and had cesarean sections performed. Results indicate that cesarean section was a useful method to resolve dystocia with high dam survivability but delays in admitting cattle to the hospital could result in increased calf mortality. Collectively, the results presented in this thesis provide methods to predict dystocia and parturition in late gestating cattle as well as highlight factors that help ensure favorable outcomes from cesarean sections...|$|R

The composition of nagyágite at Sunrise Dam conforms to ideal stoichiometry, with negligible As content and Au/(Au+Te) ratio of 0. 325 [i. e., (Pb 4. 84 Sb 1. 10 As 0. 05) 5. 99 S 5. 99 (Au 0. 98 Te 2. 03) 3. 01]. The diverse mineralogy of the post-D 4 veinlets, relative to the host veins, is attributed to small-scale reaction fronts established along zones of replacement at the polished section scale. The association of telluride assemblages and native gold is interpreted in terms of remobilization of ore components (including Ag, Sb, Te and Au) from the pre-existing assemblages, and their redeposition during subsequent tectonic events. The presence of nagyágite and Au-Ag tellurides in veins, in quantities that may be significant in economic terms, as well as the character of their breakdown products, have implications for ore processing and gold recovery, {{as well as for the}} genetic interpretation of the deposit. The strong structural control upon formation of the telluride-bearing assemblages at Sunrise <b>Dam</b> and the <b>ability</b> of these minerals to reflect changes in the local environment, contradicts the current view that these tellurides have a magmatic affiliation.
