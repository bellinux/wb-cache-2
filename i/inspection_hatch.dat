Gené retired on lap 22 with a gearbox issue as his teammate Mazzacane subsequently collided with the barriers at turn one on the same lap and had to retire from the event. Herbert became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 27 although his pit crew came unprepared and Herbert was stationary for half a minute before he exited in 17th position. On the 31st lap, Diniz made contact with the barriers at turn one and he damaged his left rear wheel, causing him to retire. Häkkinen's pace was reduced by lap 36 as he slowed with an blockage on his brake pedal and made an unscheduled pit stop. His team's mechanics opened his car's <b>inspection</b> <b>hatch</b> and rearranged radio cables. They subsequently removed a data transmitter which was the cause the blockage and Häkkinen rejoined in 9th. Trulli became the next retirement of the race when he pulled {{to the side of the}} track with a gearbox problem on the following lap.|$|E

50|$|The Mark II was {{introduced}} in 1974 supposedly as an improvement. The front and rear buoyancy tanks were built into the hull before bonding on the deck. The forward buoyancy compartment has a gap above it and under the foredeck. This would have been useful for a spinnaker chute, but class regulations of the time did not allow that. The forward compartment had a small circular <b>inspection</b> <b>hatch</b> thus removing much of the useful dry stowage space. Side buoyancy compartments gave this model a tendency to invert, and those owned by sailing schools soon sported socks filled with polystyrene to provide a righting moment when capsized. Reduced clearance under the thwart made this boat uncomfortable to sleep in.|$|E

50|$|Moelwyn Slate Quarry {{is located}} above the {{enlarged}} Llyn Stwlan. It was worked sporadically between the 1820s and 1897, but {{was connected to}} the Ffestiniog Railway by a spectacular series of seven inclines, descending some 1100 ft. Most are still visible in the landscape, but the enlargement of Llyn Stwlan destroyed the sixth incline, parts of the fifth and seventh, and much of the abandoned mill area, which was located between the fourth and fifth inclines, rather than at the quarry level, in order to benefit from the water supply provided by the lake. There are a number of <b>inspection</b> <b>hatches</b> and electric cabinets on the inclines, which are presumably connected with the power station infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevator}}, {{located in}} the inter-silo space, carried the maize to the maize elevator tower which straddles {{the roof of the}} four silos. The maize then was conveyed through one of four chutes, into a designated silo. This part of the process was performed manually and access to the maize elevator tower was via a ladder attached to the exterior wall of one of the silos. Provision for access to the tower was incorporated by installing a passageway under the silos, which led to a ladder attached to the exterior wall. The silos could be fully emptied of its maize by the incorporation of <b>inspection</b> <b>hatches</b> located {{at the base of the}} silo.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Mark of Archanon" [...] {{shooting}} script dated 12 April 1976 contained scenes either cut for time or revised by the subsequent amendments: (1) The use of dylenide crystals in the Eagles' air filters was mentioned in dialogue between Carter and Johnson during the hook. (2) The cave-in {{would be an}} accident caused by a careless technician; when not in use, the thermal cutter was left turned on and pointing at the ceiling; (3) Carter's use of the nickname 'Bluey' for Johnson was explained as Australian slang for people with red hair; (4) The plan {{to gain access to}} Pasc's Eagle by burning through the propulsion-tube's <b>inspection</b> <b>hatch</b> with acid was visualised and carried out by two Alphans. This sequence was removed for budgetary reasons; (5) The new character of Raul Nuñez was created when a scheduling conflict would prevent actor Jeffery Kissoon from portraying Ben Vincent, as intended by the script.|$|E
5000|$|In November 1964, von Braun {{proposed}} a more ambitious {{plan to build}} a much larger station built from the S-II second stage of a Saturn V. His design replaced the S-IVB third stage with an aeroshell, primarily as an adapter for the CSM on top. Inside the shell was a 10 ft cylindrical equipment section. On reaching orbit, the S-II second stage would be vented to remove any remaining hydrogen fuel, then the equipment section would be slid into it via a large <b>inspection</b> <b>hatch.</b> This became known as a [...] "wet workshop" [...] concept, because of the conversion of an active fuel tank. The station filled the entire interior of the S-II stage's hydrogen tank, with the equipment section forming a [...] "spine" [...] and living quarters located between it and the walls of the booster. This would have resulted in a very large 33 by 45 ft living area. Power was to be provided by solar cells lining the outside of the S-II stage.|$|E
50|$|Much later, {{the water}} is neck high. Pike is still pleading, and the rest assure him that they are {{thinking}} about how to get out. Walker and Godfrey discover a manhole that can be opened to allow them all to escape. The spanner to do this is hanging high on the wall, and when Hodges tries to reach it, he falls out of his tank and into the water, dropping the spanner. Pike dives under the water and retrieves the spanner, thus getting completely soaked again, but at least the men can get out. After opening the manhole, they crawl through it to the outside of the pumping house, then run round to rescue Jones, who has managed to open another <b>inspection</b> <b>hatch</b> into the flooded chamber. Godfrey shuts the outside door ("there's a very nasty draught, and I wouldn't want anyone to catch cold"), thus trapping them all in the outer room again, leaving Wilson to have to go around again through the water to get help.|$|E
50|$|The {{accident}} aircraft had, over {{a period}} of several years, developed chronic fuel leakage problems from both wings that had been remedied by the operator by repeatedly applying a sealant to the inside seams of the fuel tanks. Unfortunately, in applying the sealant inside the right wing tank the operator had inadvertently applied the material over a damaged lower stringer (an important, load-bearing structural member of the wing) in such a way as to conceal a fatigue crack. The crack had been discovered during previous maintenance, and an attempt was made to repair the crack by grinding it out. In applying the sealant, the operator was required to access the inside of the fuel tank using small removable <b>inspection</b> <b>hatches</b> in the top surface of the wing. This resulted in poor visibility and awkward conditions for working inside the tank. Unfortunately the sealant concealed the previous repair to the stringer and made subsequent checking for further damage to this component (i.e., any crack growth) impossible.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prominent}} surviving {{remnant of the}} leadworks {{is that of the}} flue chimney. The land around the chimney is owned by the State forestry company Coillte and managed by the Dublin Mountains Partnership. A waymarked walking trail around the forest, called “The Lead Mines Way”, leads to the ruin of the chimney. The top third of the chimney has been removed as it was deemed unsafe as has the lower section of the external stairs. Much of the flue, along with many of its <b>inspection</b> <b>hatches</b> still exists and can be explored. In addition, a number of buildings from the smelting works situated in the valley below also survive to the present day. These industrial buildings, all built from granite, include furnaces, purification tanks, lime kilns, stores, workers' cottages and the manager's house. Many of these buildings are now private residences while the smelter site itself is now a solvent factory. The 1857 shot tower is also still extant. However, the 1829 shot tower admired by Joyce no longer survives. The former mill pond is now part of a concrete plant.|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{discovered}} {{that much of}} the paperwork supporting MTL's declarations that the Marine Electric was seaworthy was faked. Inspection records showed <b>inspections</b> of the <b>hatch</b> covers during periods where they'd in fact been removed from the ship for maintenance; inspections were recorded during periods of time when the ship wasn't even in port. A representative of the hatch covers' manufacturer warned MTL in 1982 that their condition posed a threat to the ship’s seaworthiness. But inspectors never tested them. And yet, the Marine Electric was repeatedly certified as seaworthy.|$|R
5000|$|The laundry {{block is}} a rectangular, timber-framed, {{building}} with weatherboard-cladding to above sill height, above which is fibrous-cement sheeting and battening. It has a corrugated iron gabled roof with iron ventilators {{along the ridge}} and {{on the west side}} of the roof. The building rests on a concrete slab, and has a verandah over a concrete pathway along part of the western side of the building. There is a later, tall metal roller door at the north end of the building, but the remaining doors and fenestration appear to be original. Concrete footings associated with former tank stands are evident on the east side of the building. The building is remarkably intact, and is associated with the earliest phase of the development of the quarantine station at Lytton, in the 1910s. Enclosed laundry yard - the yard area to the east and south of the laundry block has a concrete retaining wall approximately 150mm high and 150mm wide. The west and east sides of the yard are bounded by round metal posts capped with concrete while the south side is defined by tram/trolley rails set vertically as posts (1500mm high). There is an open concrete drain along the eastern side of the yard, inside the fence posts. The yard contains 12 square wooden posts approximately 2m in height, which are likely to have supported clothes lines. A service <b>inspection</b> <b>hatch</b> is located centrally in the southern section of the yard. This has a 1m x 1m concrete housing with a 600mm x 600mm steel lid with embossed cross-hatching and the lettering [...] "Harvey & Son". A block of late 20th century relocatable toilets is also sited in this yard. Despite this, the yard remains substantially intact, and is associated with the earliest phase of the development of the quarantine station at Lytton, in the 1910s.|$|E

40|$|Determining whether power {{transformers}} {{are suffering}} from internal arcing or dangerous levels of partial discharge (PD) is important because failure without warning can result in damage to neighboring equipment, customer dissatisfaction, disruption to economic activity, and the imposition of regulatory fines. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the excitation of UHF signals by PD inside transformers. The use of externally mounted sensors has been outlined, and the structure of a dielectric window that can be constructed on an <b>inspection</b> <b>hatch</b> has been outlined. Attenuation of UHF signals propagating inside a transformer tank {{has been shown to be}} relatively low. A new approach to locating PD sources in three dimensions has been presented, based on using a numerical model of the transformer materials, which defines electromagnetic propagation velocities on a mesh of 5 -cm sub-cells. The concepts of the propagation-velocity matrix (PVM) and the propagation-time matrix (PTM) were thereby introduced. Once the PD source has been located to a specific region of the transformer, the PVM might be used to index a database of physical descriptions of the transformer that could provide additional information to assist with diagnosis...|$|E
50|$|Landing, {{originally}} {{scheduled for}} 1:34 UTC 24 September, was postponed due to difficulties in undocking the Soyuz spacecraft from the ISS. The crew entered the Soyuz TMA-18 on 23 September {{and closed the}} main hatch at 6:35 pm EDT. Skvortsov, Kornienko and Caldwell Dyson experienced problems getting a tight seal and were forced to open the Soyuz hatch for a quick <b>inspection.</b> The <b>hatch</b> later was sealed, but Expedition 25 flight engineer Yurchikhin working inside the space station had problems confirming a tight fit with the hatch on the ISS side of the interface. After an extended leak check, flight controllers in Moscow decided the docking interface was tight and leak free. As the countdown neared for undocking, commands were sent to open hooks on the MRM2 module side of the interface. But the mechanism did not respond. It was not clear what caused the hooks not to respond, however, Yurchikhin reported finding a small gear floating from the mechanism when he removed a cover.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{washable}} baghouses for fines {{collection in}} milk powder plants has been investigated. The main {{aim of this}} study was to increase the fundamental understanding of both operation and design of washable baghouses for application in milk powder plants. This work has focussed on the industrial scale. Industrial plant operating data has been collected, plant designs compared and analyses conducted on powder produced at the industrial scale. The amount of powder that becomes fines, the small size fraction of powder entrained in spray dryer outlet air streams, has been shown to be significantly greater than the traditionally vague estimate of 10 % to 20 %. The ratio of fines flows to total powder flows ranged from 49 ± 8 % to 86 ± 2 % depending on the powder type and plant operating conditions. A simple yet reliable method was developed to quantify fines flows based on measured powder size distributions of samples taken from around the plant. These estimates were supported by readings from an online optical scintillation instrument, which was shown to be capable of measuring fines flows at concentrations approximately four times the supposed maximum stated by the instrument’s manufacturer. Observations in another part of this work supported previous Fonterra observations showing that the amount of bulk fat in skim milk powder (SMP) has a large influence on the baghouse differential pressure. Fines flows measured by the optical scintillation instrument and analysis of other plant operating data showed that a change in bulk fat in SMP does not appear to cause any change in fines concentration. Observations of the surface of SMP by scanning electron microscopy, and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, both showed that fat is over-represented on the surface of the particles, and that only small increases in the bulk fat content are required to cause large increases in the surface fat coverage. It is hypothesised that increased fat on the surface of particles increases the clumping of SMP before deposition on the bags. Consequently, the powder forms more porous cakes and is less likely to penetrate into the interior of the filter bags, which also makes it easier to pulse clean powder from the filter bags. Therefore, the baghouse differential pressure is reduced. The design of pulse-jet baghouses from the literature was found to rely heavily on the authors past experience and approach, giving rise to large variation in recommended values of the key design parameters. A procedure for determining the optimal combination of these parameters was developed. This procedure showed that the main Fonterra washable baghouses are far from optimal because of their high air-to-cloth ratios, long bags and high elutriation and annular velocities. This procedure also showed that the Fonterra vibrating fluid bed washable baghouses are much closer to the optimum, which is the probable reason these washable baghouses have had almost no operational issues. Observations of the movement of the bags from below showed significant movement for bags near the inlet of the baghouse, indicating that this was the probable cause of the high bag damage in this zone. It is suggested that increasing the outer gap (distance between the baghouse wall and the bag on the edge of the bag bundle) be investigated further in an attempt to slow the annular velocity around the edge of the bag bundle and reduce bag movement. It is also recommended that stainless steel <b>inspection</b> <b>hatches</b> installed in the wall of a baghouse for this research, be included in all current and future washable baghouses because use of these hatches reduced the overall clean-in-place turn around time by 20 %. Computational fluid dynamics simulations of the air flow patterns within the Clandeboye Dryer 2 chamber were carried out using a commercial code CFX 10. 0. These simulations are possibly the first to include the influence of a spray dryer’s internal fluid bed airflow on the flow patterns within a spray dryer. As expected, the simulations showed the main air jet oscillated and precessed about the central axis with no apparent distinct frequency. In turn, the recirculation zones between the main jet and the chamber walls fluctuated in size. Different fluid bed flows within the industrial range had only a local influence on the air only flow field by reducing the length of the main jet. A different outlet boundary condition (including a flow resistance representing the baghouse) also appeared to have little influence on the overall flow field. Good agreement was found between the movements of the main jet via simulations and from telltale tufts installed in the plant dryer. This supported other indications that the simulations were an accurate representation of the actual flows. It was concluded that this project achieved its main aim of improving the fundamental understanding of washable baghouse operation and design, especially for application in milk powder plants. Also this project, as well as a change in production schedules, has helped to reduce downtime associated with the washable baghouses in the Fonterra Clandeboye Dryer 2 plant by an estimated 50 hours per annum...|$|R
40|$|Root-knot {{nematodes}} (Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica) {{were found}} infecting cultivated aloe (Aloe vera) plants {{on the island}} of Crete, Greece. The infected plants showed reddish brownish leaf discolouration associated with poor plant growth, and roots with dark necrotic areas and irregular thickening but without the typical root-knot nematode galls. Females and egg masses were embedded deeply inside the root. Nematodes were identified using PCR assays either of females, juveniles and males directly obtained from aloe roots and surrounding soil, or of females generated by culturing the nematodes from the aloe on potted tomato plants. Histopathological studies showed female and juvenile bodies and feeding sites surrounded by darkened cells, suggesting the presence of phenolic contents at high levels. Transverse and longitudinal sections confirmed that this reaction was not related to a hypersensitive response because the feeding site was established, but that giant cell formation was accompanied by phenolic compound accumulation. Egg masses isolated from aloe roots were placed in water but juveniles did not <b>hatch.</b> <b>Inspection</b> under the light microscope showed different levels of darkening, with the majority of eggs undeveloped or degenerated. Additionally, PCR reactions which were successful for females failed in these egg masses, suggesting DNA degradation or presence of inhibitory compounds. These results indicate a possible plant defence mechanism impairing viability and development of eggs which are laid inside the aloe roots. It is suggested that the females either produced detoxification enzymes or expressed higher tolerance levels to toxic compounds and thus their development was not impaired.
