Other {{elements}} of the site include the hospital building, prisoner workshops, open spaces, and a limestone ramp on the axis of the gatehouse, <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> towards the port area of Fremantle.

5|$|Because the Columbia was at {{the same}} {{latitude}} as {{the headwaters of the}} Missouri River, there was some speculation that Gray and Vancouver had discovered the long-sought Northwest Passage. A 1798 British map showed a dotted line connecting the Columbia with the Missouri. When the American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark charted the vast, unmapped lands of the American West in their overland expedition (1803–05), they found no passage between the rivers. After crossing the Rocky Mountains, Lewis and Clark built dugout canoes and paddled down the Snake River, reaching the Columbia near the present-day Tri-Cities, Washington. They explored a few miles upriver, as far as Bateman Island, before <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> the Columbia, concluding their journey at the river's mouth and establishing Fort Clatsop, a short-lived establishment that was occupied for less than three months.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} {{then moved}} to the penultimate round at the Swedish Grand Prix with Spencer holding a two-point lead over Roberts. Roberts led Spencer going into the last lap of the race. <b>Heading</b> <b>down</b> the back straight, Spencer placed his Honda right behind Roberts' Yamaha {{as they reached the}} second to the last corner, a ninety degree right-hander. As both riders applied their brakes, Spencer came out of Roberts' slipstream and managed to get inside of the Yamaha. As they exited the corner, both riders ran wide off the track and into the dirt. Spencer was able {{to get back on the}} track and back on the power first, crossing the finish line just ahead of Roberts for a crucial victory. Roberts considered Spencer's pass to be foolish and dangerous, and exchanged angry words with him on the podium. Roberts would have to win the final round at the San Marino Grand Prix with Spencer finishing no better than third place in order for Roberts to win his fourth world championship. In a fitting end to a great career, Roberts won his last-ever Grand Prix race, however Spencer was able to secure second place to claim the world championship. The two riders dominated the season with each claiming six victories in the 12 race series.|$|E

25|$|In the 2010 FIFA World Cup quarter-final {{match against}} Ghana, {{the score was}} 1–1 {{at the end of}} {{regulation}} time and the game went into extra time. Late in extra time, Ghana sent a free kick into the box; Suárez blocked Stephen Appiah's shot on the goal line. He then blocked Dominic Adiyiah's goalbound header with his hands to prevent a last minute Ghana goal, committing a professional foul to save what would have been the game winner and was sent off. Ghana's Asamoah Gyan missed the resulting penalty spot kick and Suárez, who had stopped to watch, celebrated the miss before <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> the tunnel. Ghana subsequently lost the match 4–2 in the penalty shoot-out, and Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|The safety car was {{withdrawn}} after three laps and racing resumed with Asmer leading the field {{back up to}} speed. Jarvis remained close by as he was hoping to making his move on the following lap at Lisboa corner. As Van Der Zande crossed the start/finish line to continue racing, he attempted {{to find his way}} past Kennard. Van Der Zande was unable to get past and ended up drifting into the wall at Lisboa turn while Kennard resumed without trouble. Ho then made a pit stop and retired shortly after. On the fifth lap, Jarvis made his overtaking manoevure on Asmer for the lead by slipstreaming onto the back of him <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> the main straight and passed the driver around the outside at Lisboa corner. At the same time, Senna managed to find his way past Hülkenberg and started to close the gap to Buurmann. Hülkenberg then tried to line up a passing move on Senna to reclaim the position but lost control of his car and glanced the barriers lining the track at Lisboa corner. Both he and Senna were forced into retirement. Localised yellow flags were waved which neutralised racing in that section of the circuit because of debris scattered across the tarmac surface.|$|E

25|$|The safety car {{remained}} on track for three laps, {{until it was}} withdrawn {{at the start of}} lap eleven and Jarvis kept the lead at the restart. Oshima tried an overtaking manoevure on Jarvis but became aware his tyres were too cold. Tsukakoshi overtook Asmer for the final podium position <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> to Mandarin Bend, and immediately set about on capitalising on Oshima's error. Grosjean made the restart in the field, moving up to eighth place. Kennard became the race's final retirement when he went into the barriers at Lisboa corner, possibly caused by him being caught off guard by his cold tyres. Tsukakoshi got a run on Oshima heading towards Mandarin Bend and executed an successful lunge to claim second place from his fellow countryman. Tsukakoshi then set himself after Jarvis while Mortara overtook Hartley to move into the top ten. Jarvis maintained the first position {{for the rest of the}} race to win the Grand Prix and led all of the laps contested. Tsukakoshi finished 1.7 seconds adrift in second, while fellow Japanese driver Oshima took third. Off the podium, Asmer could not catch Oshima and settled for fourth. Streit and Bird were close behind each other in fifth and sixth with Jakes in seventh. The top ten was rounded out by Grosjean, Jelley and Mortara. Outside the top ten, Buemi finished eleventh, having moved up seventeen from his starting position, and finished ahead of Hartley with Kobayashi 13th. He was ahead of Van Dam, Guerrieri, Izawa, Van Der Zande, Grubmüller, and local drivers Ávila, Lou Meng, Kit Meng, Merszei. Hülkenberg and Ho rounded out the top 24 classified finishers and were lapped by race winner Jarvis.|$|E

500|$|Captain Rogers led a {{scouting}} expedition from Fort Edward on January 15, {{stopping at}} Fort William Henry to acquire provisions, snowshoes, and additional soldiers. The company left Fort William Henry on January 17 with 86 men, <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> the frozen Lake George. The next day twelve men turned back because of injuries. The remaining men continued north, reaching Lake Champlain {{at a point}} between Fort Carillon and Fort St. Frédéric on January 21. They spotted a sled moving on the lake toward Fort St. Frédéric, so Rogers sent Lieutenant John Stark and some men to intercept it. [...] However, more sleds were spotted, and Stark's men were seen before they could retreat back into the woods. The sleds turned back toward Carillon. The British gave chase, {{but most of the}} French escaped. Rogers succeeded in taking seven prisoners.|$|E
500|$|Church Siding was {{immediately}} west of Wotton. It {{was treated as}} a station during the Tramway's early years and listed as such in timetables, but was never redeveloped following the conversion to locomotive haulage and its [...] "platform" [...] remained an earth bank with no buildings. Trains <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> the Quainton Road–Brill line would pause {{at the entrance to the}} siding, and any wagons intended for the siding would be detached and hauled down the siding by rope. It ceased to be listed in timetables in September 1894, although there is some evidence that passenger trains ceased to make scheduled stops at Church Siding before this date. Freight trains are recorded as stopping at Church Siding to load goods as late as 1899. Church Siding was the scene of the Tramway's only fatal accident, on 8 March 1883.|$|E

40|$|Positioning {{combined}} with coughing and huffing is frequently {{used to promote}} secretion clearance. Maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) and {{peak expiratory flow rate}} (PEFR) have been used as surrogate measures of cough and huff strength. This study investigated the effect of body position on MEP and PEFR. Repeated measures of MEP and PEFR were performed across seven randomised positions (standing, chair sitting, sitting in bed with backrest vertical, sitting in bed with backrest at 45 degrees, supine, side lying, and side lying with <b>head</b> <b>down</b> tilt 20 degrees) on 25 adults with normal respiratory function (NRF) and 11 adults with chronic airflow limitation (CAL). For the NRF group, MEP in standing (143 ± 10 cmH 2 O, mean ± SEM) was significantly higher than MEP in chair sitting (133 ± 10 cmH 2 O) which in turn was significantly higher than in the remaining positions. The MEP in <b>head</b> <b>down</b> tilt (108 ± 9 cmH 2 O) was significantly lower than in all other positions. The PEFR in standing (571 ± 24 ml/s) was significantly higher and <b>head</b> <b>down</b> tilt (486 ± 23 ml/s) was significantly lower than in all other positions. For the CAL group, MEP in standing (134 ± 18 cmH 2 O) was significantly higher, while in <b>head</b> <b>down</b> tilt (96 ± 15 cmH 2 O) was significantly lower, than in most other positions. For the CAL group, PEFR in standing (284 ± 40 ml/s) was significantly higher, while in <b>head</b> <b>down</b> tilt (219 ± 38 ml/s) was significantly lower, than in most other positions. Body position has a significant effect on MEP and PEFR in NRF and CAL subjects, with the lowest values in the <b>head</b> <b>down</b> position. Thus, to maximise the strength of expiratory manoeuvres during treatments that use the <b>head</b> <b>down</b> position, patients should be encouraged to adopt a more upright position when coughing or huffing...|$|R
