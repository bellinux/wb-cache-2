50|$|A {{class rating}} is an {{allowance}} {{to fly a}} certain group of aircraft that require training common to all aircraft within the group. A type rating is specified if a particular aircraft requires additional specialized training {{beyond the scope of}} initial license and aircraft class training. What aircraft require a type rating is decided by the local aviation authority. Almost all single <b>engine</b> <b>piston</b> (SEP) or multi <b>engine</b> <b>piston</b> (MEP) single pilot aircraft can be flown without a type rating, but are covered by a class rating instead. An exception to this under European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations is the piston version of the Piper Malibu.|$|E

The majority of flights are with smaller single <b>engine</b> <b>piston</b> aircraft, either for training or recreational purposes.|$|E
50|$|The Interceptor 400 was a turboprop-powered single-engined light {{aircraft}} {{developed from the}} Meyers 200 single <b>engine</b> <b>piston</b> plane. It attracted buyers {{but was unable to}} obtain adequate manufacturing financing, and was perhaps too far ahead of its time. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, {{at the time of its}} development, the market for single-engined turboprops was still a decade away.|$|E
50|$|A {{hypereutectic}} piston is {{an internal}} combustion <b>engine</b> <b>piston</b> cast using a hypereutectic alloy-that is, a metallic alloy {{which has a}} composition beyond the eutectic point. Hypereutectic pistons are made of an aluminum alloy which has much more silicon present than is soluble in aluminum at the operating temperature. Hypereutectic aluminum has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion, which allows engine designers to specify much tighter tolerances.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{induction}} systems on internal combustion engines: naturally aspirated engine (air is sucked in using the <b>engine's</b> <b>pistons),</b> or forced induction engines (see supercharged or turbocharged engines).|$|R
5000|$|The second {{generation}} consists of <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> with new designs from scratch for fairly constant load in series hybrids. They include the wankel engines, rotary combustion <b>engines</b> and free <b>piston</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hand {{starting}} {{of aircraft}} <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> by swinging the propeller {{is the oldest}} and simplest method, {{the absence of any}} onboard starting system giving an appreciable weight saving. Positioning of the propeller relative to the crankshaft is arranged such that the <b>engine</b> <b>pistons</b> pass through top dead centre during the swinging stroke.|$|R
5000|$|The Coffman device used a large blank {{cartridge}} containing Cordite that, when fired, pushed a piston forward. A screw thread {{driven by the}} piston engaged with the engine, turning it over. [...] This was in contrast with other type of cartridge starter which acted directly to drive the <b>engine</b> <b>piston</b> down and so turn {{the rest of the}} engine over, such as those used on the Field-Marshall agricultural diesel tractor.|$|E
5000|$|In the past, {{the engine}} {{break-in}} period {{was very important}} to the overall life and durability of the engine. The break-in period required has changed over the years with improved piston ring materials and designs. In reference to small engines, the break-in period now (5-10 hours) is short in comparison with that of engines of the past. Aluminum cylinder bore <b>engine</b> <b>piston</b> rings break-in faster than those used on cast iron cylinder bores.|$|E
5000|$|The Socata TB is {{a series}} of light single <b>engine</b> <b>piston</b> {{aircraft}} developed and manufactured by French aircraft company SOCATA. The letters TB within the designation stands for Tarbes, the French city where the aircraft is manufactured. The TB series planes have {{come to be known as}} the [...] "Caribbean Planes", due to the island naming convention adopted for the various models, though they are not often seen flown in that region.|$|E

50|$|The {{types of}} {{aircraft}} one may fly {{depends on what}} they are certified for, e.g. Airplane Single Engine land. See Categories and Classes for a list. Usually, a newly minted private pilot is certified to fly all planes in the generic category single <b>engine</b> <b>piston,</b> often abbreviated SEP. This includes the Cessna 172, PA-28, Diamond DA40, Robin DR400 and similar planes. More complex types, like those with retractable undercarriage or variable pitch props, require additional training and licensing.|$|E
50|$|The Cessna 310 was {{a common}} charter {{aircraft}} for the many air taxi firms that sprang up in the general aviation boom that followed World War II. The advantages of the Cessna 310 over its contemporaries, such as the Piper PA-23, were its speed, operating costs and after market modifications such as the Robertson STOL kits which made it popular worldwide for its bush flying characteristics. It could use short runways {{while at the same}} time carrying a large useful load of 2000 lb. or more, at high speeds for a twin <b>engine</b> <b>piston</b> aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s a concept engine called the Bricklin-Turner Rotary Vee was tested. The Rotary Vee {{is similar in}} {{configuration}} to the elbow steam <b>engine.</b> <b>Piston</b> pairs connect as solid V shaped members, with each end floating {{in a pair of}} rotating cylinders clusters. The rotating cylinder cluster pairs are set with their axes at a wide V angle. The pistons in each cylinder cluster move parallel to each other instead of a radial direction, This engine design has not gone into production. The Rotary Vee was intended to power the Bricklin SV-1.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>piston</b> <b>engine,</b> a <b>piston</b> rod joins a piston to the {{crosshead}} {{and thus}} to the connecting rod that drives the crankshaft or (for steam locomotives) the driving wheels.|$|R
50|$|The name 'trunk piston' {{derives from}} the 'trunk engine', an early design of marine steam engine. To make these more compact, they avoided the steam <b>engine's</b> usual <b>piston</b> rod with {{separate}} crosshead and were instead the first engine design to place the gudgeon pin directly within the piston. Otherwise these trunk <b>engine</b> <b>pistons</b> bore {{little resemblance to the}} trunk piston; they were extremely large diameter and double-acting. Their 'trunk' was a narrow cylinder mounted in the centre of the piston.|$|R
