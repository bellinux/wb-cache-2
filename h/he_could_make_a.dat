5|$|At {{the start}} of the 193637 season, Miller was {{selected}} for the Colts, a state under-21 team that played at district level. At the end of the 1936 school year, Miller completed year 10 by passing five of his eight subjects. Disinclined towards university studies, he left school without finishing his leaving year and began working as a clerk for a car business. Miller felt confident that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> career out of sport and therefore felt that further education was unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Favaloro became {{interested}} in developments in cardiovascular intervention, and developed an enthusiasm for thoracic surgery. During one visit to La Plata, he met Professor Mainetti, who pointed him {{in the direction of}} the Cleveland Clinic. Although in the beginning he had doubts about leaving his profession as a rural physician, he thought that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> greater contribution to the community on returning from the United States. With few resources and rudimentary English, he decided to travel to Cleveland. He first worked as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team, working with Donald B. Effler, head of cardiovascular surgery, F. Mason Sones, Jr., who was in charge of the Angiography Laboratory and William L. Proudfit, head of the Department of Cardiology.|$|E
5|$|As Zwingli {{was working}} on {{establishing}} these political alliances, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the Augsburg Diet to present their views so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> verdict {{on the issue of}} faith. The Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, Memmingen, and Lindau produced the Tetrapolitan Confession. This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too late for the Burgrecht cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, Fidei ratio (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the Apostles' Creed. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, Johann Eck, counter-attacked with a publication, Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor.|$|E

25|$|On {{his return}} Dexter was made captain of Sussex, which he held until {{he retired in}} 1965. He had a quiet home Test season against South Africa, but in the First Test at Edgbaston in the 1961 Ashes series England started their second innings needing 321 runs to avoid an innings defeat. Dexter made 180, the biggest century for England against Australia since the war and studded with 31 {{cracking}} boundaries, but typically he was stumped in the last minutes of the match trying to hit Bobby Simpson for six so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> double century. In the famous Fourth Test at Old Trafford he played a spectacular innings of 76 in 84 minutes to take England to 106 runs from victory with 9 wickets in hand and the Ashes in sight, but his dismissal set off an England collapse and the series was lost.|$|E
25|$|In 1875 his {{attention}} {{was called to}} the dressing of fur skins, such as buffalo hides. Using existing processes, it took from two to {{two and a half}} days of hard labor to bring a large hide down to a flexiable state. When House claimed that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> machine that could dress four hides or more a day, they were astonished, as they claimed no tool could stand up to those dry hides for even ten minutes. To meet the challenge, House developed a rotary plane with a ring knife that could be fed as it moved, with a set of small emery wheels each side of the knife so that it was sharpened on every revolution. The plane was universally hung and counterbalanced so it weighed nothing in the hand of the operator, though it was driven by power from the engine. On a wager, the first operator finished fifty hides in ten hours.|$|E
50|$|Morris {{started his}} career with the Melbourne reserve team but before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> {{impression}} <b>he</b> decided to join the army.

Their initial appeal against the suspension was rejected on 31 October, 2010. Butt and Amir hit out at the ICC saying that, although the ruling went against them, they weren't informed {{of the reasons for the}} decision.|$|E
25|$|Aiken {{attended}} Raleigh's Leesville Road High School {{and took}} courses at Campbell University before enrolling at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

He and Laurel have been sleeping together secretly throughout the summer, and the next step of his plan is to sleep with Ivy as well. When he succeeds, taking her virginity, both of them find out, leaving Ivy upset with her mother.
