Inflation has also generally trended lower through the 2000s, {{with some of the}} fluctuations in inflation reflecting government policy initiatives such as the changes in fiscal subsidies in 2005 and 2008 which caused large temporary spikes in CPI growth. Since 2007, however, with the improvement in banking sector and domestic consumption, national economic growth has accelerated to over 6% annually and this helped Indonesia weather the 2008–2009 Great Recession. The Indonesian economy performed strongly during the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and in 2012, its GDP grew by over 6%. Indonesia regained its investment grade rating in late 2011 after losing it in 1997. , 11% of the population lived below the poverty line and the official open unemployment rate was 5.9%.|$|E

It is an important indicator in the National Accounts as it distinguishes output growth that comes about due to volume increase and that due to price changes. In effect, the <b>GDP</b> implied <b>deflator</b> illustrates how much of the change in nominal GDP from one year to another reflects changes in the price level. It is referred to as the implied deflator: for example, if GDP increases by 2 per cent in real terms and 5 per cent in nominal terms, the implied economy-wide rate of inflation is 3 per cent.

This study attempts {{to separate the}} inefficiency caused by management and the inefficiency caused by operational environment. Applying the four-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach proposed by Fried et al. (1999), this paper studies the operational environment-adjusted efficiency of eleven nationwide banks in China from 1995 to 2004. There are two outputs (investment and loans) and three inputs (deposits, employees, and fixed assets) in the DEA model. All nominal variables are transformed into real variables by the <b>GDP</b> <b>deflators</b> at the 1995 price level. After adjusting the input variables by excluding effects caused by environmental factors, state-owned banks show a greater improvement on efficiency. This implies that joint-equity ownership significantly favors nationwide banks in China. State-owned banks can hence engage in ownership reform to improve their efficiency...|$|R

40|$|According to {{conventional}} income measures, nineteenth century American and British industrial workers were {{two to four}} times as wealthy as poor people in developing countries today. Surprisingly, however, today's poor are less hungry than yesterday's wealthy industrial workers. I estimate the demand for calories of American and British industrial workers using the 1888 Cost of Living Survey and find that the estimated calorie elasticities for both American and British households are greater than calorie elasticity estimates for households in present day developing countries. The results are robust to measurement error, unreported food consumption, and indirect estimation bias. This finding implies substantial nutritional improvements among the poor in the twentieth century. Using the Engel curve implied by the historical calorie elasticities, I derive new income estimates for developing countries which yield income estimates that are six to ten times greater than those derived using purchasing power parity or <b>GDP</b> <b>deflators.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Thus {{the real}} {{exchange}} rate is {{the exchange rate}} times the relative prices of a market basket of goods in the two countries. For example, the purchasing power of the US dollar relative {{to that of the}} euro is the dollar price of a euro (dollars per euro) times the euro price of one unit of the market basket (euros/goods unit) divided by the dollar price of the market basket (dollars per goods unit), and hence is dimensionless. This is the exchange rate (expressed as dollars per euro) times the relative price of the two currencies in terms of their ability to purchase units of the market basket (euros per goods unit divided by dollars per goods unit). If all goods were freely tradable, and foreign and domestic residents purchased identical baskets of goods, purchasing power parity (PPP) would hold for the exchange rate and <b>GDP</b> <b>deflators</b> (price levels) of the two countries, and the real exchange rate would always equal 1.|$|R

40|$|Do {{theoretical}} {{welfare gains}} from trade translate into aggregate measures of economic activity? We calculate {{the changes in}} real GDP and real consumption that result from changes in trade costs {{in a range of}} workhorse trade models, following the procedures outlined by statistical agencies in the United States. Our main findings are as follows: First, real GDP and measured aggregate productivity rise in response to reductions in variable trade costs if <b>GDP</b> <b>deflators</b> capture the decline in trade costs. Second, with balanced trade in each country, changes in world real consumption and changes in world real GDP (i. e. : weighting the change in each country by its nominal GDP) in response to changes in variable trade costs coincide, up to a first-order approximation, with changes in world theoretical (welfare-based) consumption. The equivalence between measured consumption and theoretical consumption holds country-by-country under stronger conditions. Third, for given trade shares and changes in variable trade costs, changes in real GDP and changes in world real consumption are approximately equal in magnitude across the models we consider. ...|$|R
40|$|In a 1989 Contemporary Policy Issues article Miller and Russek {{published}} {{findings of}} a causal relation between the fiscal deficit and the trade deficit. However, they found no overwhelming support for reverse causation between the twin deficits. The authors of the analysis here gathered annual data on U. S. federal budget deficits and net exports for 1950 - 1988 and deflated the nominal values by the <b>GDP</b> <b>deflators</b> to examine the causal relation based on real values. They made a distinction between structural and actual budget deficits. Instead of an arbitrary choice of lag structure, they used Hsiao (1979, 1981) minimum final prediction error criterion to determine the optimum lag lengths of the explanatory variables. The analysis reveals a unidirectional causal relation running from structural budget deficits to net exports, confirming some of Miller and Russek's findings. Contrary to Miller and Russek's conclusions, however, findings here indicate a bi-directional causal relation between actual budget deficits and net exports. These findings suggest important policy implications. Copyright 1992 Western Economic Association International. ...|$|R
