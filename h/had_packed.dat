5|$|Manning {{became the}} target of {{bullying}} at the school {{because she was the}} only American and was viewed as effeminate. Manning had come out to two friends in Oklahoma as gay, but was not open about it at school in Wales. The students would imitate her accent, and apparently abandoned her once during a camping trip; her aunt told The Washington Post that Manning awoke to an empty camp site one morning, after everyone else <b>had</b> <b>packed</b> up their tents and left without her.|$|E
25|$|During {{filming of}} a {{television}} documentary in the 1970s, crew attached a replica of Pearse's 1902 machine by a rope to a team of horses. When the horses bolted, the machine took to the air and flew, indicating that the design could fly. This did not get filmed, as the crew <b>had</b> <b>packed</b> away their cameras {{at the end of}} the day's shooting.|$|E
25|$|Newkirk {{helped her}} mother {{out in the}} leper colony—packing pills and rolling bandages, {{stuffing}} toys for orphans, and feeding strays—and says that this informed her view that anyone in need, including animals, was worthy of concern, along with her mother's advice that it doesn't matter who suffers, but how. She {{tells the story of}} an early experience of trying to rescue an animal, when she heard laughter in the alleyway behind the family home in New Delhi. A group of people had bound a dog's legs, muzzled him, then lowered him into a muddy ditch, laughing as they watched him try to escape. Newkirk asked her servant to bring the dog to her, and {{tried to get him to}} drink some water, but someone <b>had</b> <b>packed</b> his throat with mud, and he died in her arms. She told the Financial Times that it was a turning point.|$|E

25|$|The eighteenth {{stage was}} an {{individual}} time trial, with a finish on the Mont Ventoux. It was won {{with a great}} margin by Jean-François Bernard, who became the new leader of the general classification, and the new hope of the French cycling fans. Bernard was a good climber and a good time-trialist, and {{had the support of}} a good team, so he could be able to stay leader {{until the end of the}} race. But already in the next stage, Bernard lost considerable time. He had a flat tire just before the top of a climb, and lost contact with the other riders while he had to wait for repairs, and had to spend energy to get back. His rivals Mottet and Roche had made a plan to attack in the feed zone, where cyclists could get their lunch. Mottet and Roche <b>had</b> <b>packed</b> extra food at the start of the stage, and attacked while Bernard was at the back of the peloton. Bernard chased them, but was not able to get back to them, and lost four minutes in that stage, which made Roche the new leader, closely followed by Mottet and Delgado.|$|E
500|$|When Wallen {{bought the}} roadhouse, it still <b>had</b> <b>packed</b> dirt floors and rough wood walls. To improve the interior, she {{scavenged}} wallpaper, sometimes using different patterns on different {{walls of the}} same room. She made a hardwood parquet floor from wooden kerosene crates collected from the freighters and boatmen who patronized the roadhouse. Her ability to grow crops {{and to make a}} pleasant space transformed the inn and its offerings. For meals, she provided fresh milk and eggs, berries, fish, game, and produce picked from the garden and nearby orchard. Afterward, travelers could go to clean, comfortable beds in the multi-story building. A 1929 travelogue of the Richardson Highway described Rika's by the following: [...] "a commodious roadhouse boasting of such luxuries as fresh milk and domestic fowls." ...|$|E
500|$|Culturally, the album's {{glorification of}} teenage freedom {{made a very}} big impact on the overall Britpop music scene. The whole genre {{was seen as the}} voice of youth, but Supergrass, still teens {{themselves}} when the album was made, addressed the subject with more insight than most. The most well-known song from the album, [...] "Alright", is still played regularly in Britain and Ireland, and held up as a musical example of teenage rebellion. Though it is one of their most popular songs, the band rarely play [...] "Alright" [...] in their live sets any more. In a 1999 interview, Gaz Coombes joked, [...] "We don't play 'Alright' anymore. We should play it in a minor key, and in the past tense." [...] Around the time of its release Coombes said that [...] "it wasn't written as an anthem. It isn't supposed to be a rally cry for our generation. The stuff about We are young/We run green... isn't about being 19 but really 13 or 14 and just discovering girls and drinking. It's meant to be light-hearted and a bit of a laugh, not at all a rebellious call to arms." [...] Danny Goffey noted, [...] "It certainly wasn't written in a very summery vibe. It was written in a cottage where the heating <b>had</b> <b>packed</b> up and we were trying to build fires to keep warm." ...|$|E

500|$|Gabriel {{wanted the}} album to [...] "crash {{open at the}} front" [...] and despite disliking [...] "metal" [...] {{percussion}} instruments, he was persuaded by Lanois to allow The Police's Stewart Copeland to play cymbals and hi-hat on its opener, [...] "Red Rain". The track sees Gabriel sing in his upper register with a throaty, gravely texture, of a destructive world with social problems such as torture and kidnapping. Its concept originated from a dream in which he envisaged the parting of a vast, red sea and human-like glass bottles filling up with blood. It was also intended to continue the story of Mozo, a recurring character in Gabriel's first and second albums. The second track, [...] "Sledgehammer", was the final track to be conceived of. Although most of Gabriel's band <b>had</b> <b>packed</b> away their equipment and were ready to leave the studio, Gabriel asked them to reassemble to quickly run through a song he had an idea for. [...] "Sledgehammer" [...] was partially inspired by the music of Otis Redding, and Gabriel sought out Wayne Jackson, whom Gabriel had seen on tour with Redding in the 1960s, to record horns for the track. Opened by a shakuhachi bamboo flute, its beat is dominated by brass instruments, particularly Jackson's horn, and features lyrics abundant with sexual euphemisms. Manu Katché's drums were recorded in one take as he believed any subsequent version would be inferior to his original interpretation of the music.|$|E
500|$|Trump {{ended his}} {{relationship}} with Melania Knauss in January 2000, removing a key figure of the campaign entourage. [...] According to the New York Daily News, an associate of Trump said the move was meant to appease Reform Party leaders. [...] Roger Stone denied the suggestion. [...] In addressing the matter, Trump complimented Knauss and commented, [...] "she will be missed." [...] Shortly thereafter, {{in an attempt to}} bring the two Reform Party factions together, Trump invited party leaders to the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. Addressing the 170 party members, who attended the event (including former chairman Russ Verney), Trump proclaimed [...] "I'm very proud to be in the party of Ross Perot and Jesse Ventura." [...] Verney appreciated the gesture and in shifting from his once-chilly reception to the Trump candidacy, he welcomed Trump into the race. [...] After opening the event to questions, one attendee asked Trump whether he would appear at the Florida Reform Party's state convention. [...] Trump said he would consider it [...] "very seriously." [...] Concerning Buchanan, Trump repeated he could not support Buchanan as the party's nominee. [...] Despite the retreat, the intra-party dispute over the location of the convention continued. [...] Citing scheduling conflicts, Trump did not attend the Florida Reform Party's state convention. [...] Reports suggested that Trump insiders believed Buchanan <b>had</b> <b>packed</b> the convention with supporters and would embarrass Trump by winning all the state's delegates. [...] There were also growing indications Trump was considering withdrawing from the race, commenting that he was [...] "deeply concerned" [...] about the conflict within the party. [...] In another attempt to unite the party's factions, Trump wrote letters to Ventura and Perot, requesting the two make peace. [...] Trump believed the instability of the party would hinder his chances of presidential success. Stone commented that [...] "the [...] party is melting down before our very eyes." [...] On the final day of January, Trump was removed from the New York primary ballot after a judge determined that Trump's supporters had failed to obtain the required 5,000 signatures from registered Reform Party members. [...] This marked a victory for Buchanan's supporters, including leftist activist Lenora Fulani, who had hoped to prevent Trump from appearing on the ballot in his home state.|$|E

2500|$|In late December 1984, a Chukchi hunter {{spotted a}} herd of up to 3,000 beluga whales {{struggling}} for breathing room in small pools of open water in the ice-covered waters off the Chukchi Peninsula. Easterly winds <b>had</b> <b>packed</b> the narrow Senyavin Strait with drift ice up to [...] thick, creating a wide ice pack that the whales could not cross on a single breath. While the locals {{tried to keep the}} animals alive by feeding them with frozen fish and keeping the breathing holes open, it soon became evident that the belugas would eventually perish unless they could be freed.|$|E
2500|$|While free on appeal, {{and before}} {{receiving}} a presidential pardon, Symington {{had attempted to}} reinvent himself as a private citizen and decided to enroll himself in culinary school. Symington stated of his experience that [...] "It was very educational and very humbling." [...] During his enrollment at the school, Symington <b>had</b> <b>packed</b> a bag of his belongings in case he had to report to Nellis Federal Prison in Las Vegas, Nevada on 24 hours notice, but this was made moot following his pardon from President Clinton. After graduating from the Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts Scottsdale, Symington helped to found the Arizona Culinary Institute. The school was co-founded with several other business partners including chef Robert E. Wilson, entrepreneur Jerry Moyes and former President of the Scottsdale Culinary Institute Darren Leite. The vision of the school {{was to create a}} small class environment with hands on training, with a specific focus on the traditional French methods of cooking. The school was opened and started its first classes in early 2002 in Scottsdale.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2005 off-season, it {{was widely}} speculated that Pat Riley was {{attempting}} to run Van Gundy out of his coaching job and take over the job himself, now that the team {{was in a position}} to contend for the championship. Indeed, Van Gundy would resign from his position as head coach on December 12, 2005, just 21 games into the season, citing a need to spend more time with his family, and Riley resumed coaching the Heat. Riley's Heat team defeated his Los Angeles Lakers-days nemesis, the Detroit Pistons, in the 2006 Eastern Conference Finals on June 2, 2006, making it the first time the Miami Heat reached the finals. Riley's Heat squared off against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA Finals. Despite losing the first two games to Dallas, the Heat rallied to win the next four games and their first NBA Championship. After Game Six, Riley commented that he <b>had</b> <b>packed</b> one suit, one shirt and one tie for the trip to Dallas. It was Riley's fifth championship as a head coach, and his first with a team other than the Lakers. Riley became one of only two NBA coaches to take three different teams to the NBA Finals, the other being Alex Hannum. He joined Hannum and Phil Jackson as the only head coaches to lead two different teams to NBA titles. [...] He also became the only coach to twice replace a coach in mid-season and take that team to an NBA title.|$|E

2500|$|In late August 1939, {{while on}} holiday in the {{mountains}} with her mother, Kitty went canoeing, and ended up disappearing down the river. After realising her daughter was missing, Lola informed the police, who began searching for her. Eventually, Kitty returned with her canoe by train, and found her mother in a frantic state – {{not only because of}} her daughter's disappearance, but because she had {{received a phone call from}} Karol telling them they must return home straight away. Kitty's brother, Robert, was also on holiday with his friends at the time, and was too summoned home. Arriving home to find that Karol <b>had</b> <b>packed</b> up all their possessions, her father sent Kitty and her mother to board the train to Lublin straight away (she had not known at the time, but already the Germans had placed machine guns on the rooftops of the town, and had been shooting at citizens). Two days later (still prior to the Nazis' invasion of Poland on 1 September), Karol and Robert joined them in Lublin; the two had managed to board one of the last trains out of the town, with the remaining citizens being forced to flee by foot – it later transpired that many of these people were eventually gunned down in their attempts to escape, when the invading forces caught up with them. Karol had arranged for the family's possessions to be sent on to Lublin by train, however they never arrived, due to the fact that the train had been bombed. Kitty considers the family's flight from Bielsko the first time she felt the effects of the war.|$|E
