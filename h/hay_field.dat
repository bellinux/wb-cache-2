50|$|On {{the south}} side of the roughly east-west Brown Road, the {{property}} is mostly natural, with a <b>hay</b> <b>field,</b> woods, and a shallow pond straddling the property line. It is fed by a small stream that runs through it from northeast to southwest. In the northeast corner is the other outbuilding, a wagon shed.|$|E
50|$|Early in the 1920s another {{club was}} formed in the neighbourhood, Blaenrhondda. They played on a field {{belonging}} to a local farmer and {{under the guidance of}} Mr. T. L. Mort, the local Colliery Agent, the <b>Hay</b> <b>Field</b> was transformed into a rugby pitch. However, after struggling during a difficult period in the early 1920s the team was close to disbanding. Around this time the private company that owned the Treherbert R.F.C.'s field sold the <b>Hay</b> <b>Field</b> to Great Western Railway and the Treherbert Club found themselves without a home. With Treherbert homeless and Blaenrhondda struggling to survive, the future appeared rather dim. In 1929 Treherbert RFC disbanded due to financial troubles and the remains of the team moved the mile up the valley to Blaenrhondda to merge with the smaller club. The merged teams of Treherbert and Blaenrhondda (until 1954 known as Blaenrhondda when the Club changed back to Treherbert R.F.C.) now playing on Blaenrhondda Park won the Rhondda and East Glamorgan League in 1935-36 as well as winning the Coleman Cup twice.|$|E

Bourke grew up on the <b>Hay</b> <b>Field</b> Farm in St. James, {{purchased}} by his father from the Hudson's Bay Company; he later inherited the farm. He married Isabella Hallett in 1863. Bourke served as captain leading a group of volunteers during the Fenian raids. He later served on the council for St. James and {{as a member of the}} local school board. Bourke died in Ocean Park, California and was buried in Winnipeg.|$|E

50|$|The {{land that}} Hayfield Secondary sits on {{was at one}} time part of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate. Because of a small natural spring {{underneath}} the school, the land served as a <b>hay</b> <b>field.</b> The land itself changed hands numerous times, until 1956 when developers constructed the nearby Hayfield Farm Community, {{the first of many}} housing developments in the region. Hayfield Secondary opened its doors to middle school (7th and 8th grade) students as well as 9-10th grades during the 1968-1969 school year, while still under construction. Floyd W. Worley was the first Principal.|$|E
50|$|The Doyle Reservation, {{located in}} the city of Leominster, Massachusetts, is a 170 acre {{landscaped}} urban park and open space reservation managed by The Trustees of Reservations (TTOR), a non-profit conservation organization. It is also the location of TTOR's Doyle Center: a conservation education center, regional office, and green building initiative. The property consists of three main areas: Pierce Meadow, a landscaped urban park and former estate of Harry W.

In 1855, a large reservoir was required for the waste disposal of the institution. Periodically this reservoir would be drained and the solids would be removed and made into liquid fertilizer to be spread on the <b>hay</b> <b>field.</b> Over the five years, the boys would be involved in creating gravel walkways, setting apple and pear trees as well as the daily chores in the operations of the gardens and livestock.|$|E

5000|$|A {{portion of}} the estate served as a farm with a <b>hay</b> <b>field.</b> In 1980, {{developer}} Alan Borg purchased the property, performing a minor restoration. In 1984 Borg held a [...] "Decorator's Showhouse" [...] event with rooms redecorated for free by various decorators retaining some of the original period materials combined with outside furnishings and materials. In 1985, Borg attempted to convert the house into a 15-room inn and restaurant, but failed to approval for the increased activity on the lot in a residential neighborhood. The land has been subdivided with a LDS Church built in the former pasture.|$|E
50|$|The {{music video}} {{was shot by}} Zachariah de Cairo and {{released}} on April 30th, 2015. It features Wigmore surfacing above water in a nearby creek. As she emerges, there is an arrow sticking out of her abdomen. She quickly returns to land and runs through the forest while being pursed by the hunter who shot her. Wigmore climbs {{the top of a}} rock but slips do to a loose rock fragment and falls off. She later collapses from exhaustion in a nearby <b>hay</b> <b>field.</b> The hunter catches up and she accepts her fate and is carried off the hunter.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1800s the South End of Halifax {{began to}} be settled with large estates and land grants. One of those was the estate of John Tremaine, which was bought by Enos Collins in the 1824 and renamed Gorserbook. [...] “Gorsebrook” {{extended}} from Robie Street on the west, South Street on the north, Gorsebrook Avenue on the south and Wellington Street and Tower Road on the east. Today’s Gorsebrook Park was the <b>hay</b> <b>field</b> of the property, with the Collins house located on Tower Road near the current location of the Hoburg Centre at Saint Mary's University. While SMU has plaque noting the location, the house was torn down in 1960’s {{and this was the}} incident that spurred the founding of Heritage Trust of Nova Scotia.|$|E

5000|$|Rupe is a {{clustered}} {{village on}} the Rute Plateau (Rutarska planota) along the road from Selo pri Robu to Mohorje. The Ograje <b>hay</b> <b>field</b> lies north of the village. The Graben area to the west contains many springs, and above this is Selan Crag (...) and the Matejec Clearing (...) with tilled fields and hay fields. To the south are the Zglavnice fields, and to the southeast meadows and terraced fields. To the east are hay fields in an area known as Lošca, with a road leading to Dednik and a trail through the woods offering a shortcut to Rob. The area also has a deep karst shaft surrounded by many depressions. The soil is sandy loam. Near the road there is an intermittent spring with a walled outlet.|$|E
50|$|Dolenja Brezovica is a {{clustered}} village {{southeast of}} Preserje {{on the west}} slope of Lisec Hill (673 m) {{at the bottom of}} a dry karst valley. Above the village, the valley rises steeply towards Gorenja Brezovica, and to the northwest it drops to the small Ponikve Karst Field. During heavy rains, Ponikva Creek in the karst field floods; it surfaces here after running below ground from Rakitna and then disappears into the Rupe Sinkholes at the northwest end of the karst field. Tilled fields and meadows cover the floor of the dry karst valley, and the slopes of Lisec Hill to the northeast and Štanga Hill (644 m) to the southwest are wooded. There is a low-quality <b>hay</b> <b>field</b> mowed once a year at Pungert on the lower slope of Štanga Hill.|$|E
50|$|Ribnica is {{the site}} of a mass grave {{associated}} with the Second World War. The Žiglovica Cave Mass Grave (Grobišče Jama Žiglovica) is located northeast of the town, in a former <b>hay</b> <b>field</b> on a slope overgrown with grass and sparse woods. It contains the remains of 14 civilians from Prigorica, Žlebič, and Pri Cerkvi-Struge that were murdered on 28 July 1942. The men were abducted by a Partisan patrol while clearing woods along the railway. Some of the victims were thrown into the shaft alive, and one of them managed to pull a Partisan in with him. After the murders, the local Partisan political activist insisted that the men had merely been sent to White Carniola for punitive labor, but the murders were acknowledged by some of the Partisan participants.|$|E

50|$|The females usually {{lay eggs}} in a nest {{excavated}} by themselves in sandy soils. Nest has five to ten brood cells, each having one egg and pollen as food for the larva. Every day there is one offspring produced in good weather conditions for foraging, and five to ten in a lifetime. These nests are made in dry parts of a traditionally managed <b>hay</b> <b>field</b> in medium pressure horse-graze pastures with sparse vegetation and on human-trampled paths.These bees relies heavily on pollen, that is almost like a species saving resource. The critical pollen resource for 10 reproducing A. hattorfiana ♀ varied from 27 to 361 plant individuals. Therefore, {{being able to get}} pollen from only one flower may have helped lead this species to the endangerment of being extinct.|$|E
5000|$|Before he {{was sentenced}} to life, Andy managed to sell off his assets and invest the {{proceeds}} under a pseudonym. This alias, Peter Stevens, has a driver's license, Social Security card, and other credentials. The documents required to claim Stevens' assets and assume his identity are in a safe deposit box in a Portland bank; the key to the box is hidden under a rock along a wall lining a <b>hay</b> <b>field</b> {{in the small town of}} Buxton, not far from Shawshank. After 18 years in prison, Andy shares the information with Red, describing exactly how to find the place and how one day [...] "Peter Stevens" [...] will own a small seaside resort hotel in Zihuatanejo, Mexico. Red, confused about why Andy has confided this information in him, reflects on Andy's continued ability to surprise.|$|E
5000|$|Purchase of the Norton parcel was {{inspired}} by the People's Park in Berkeley, California, with some donations for the down payment raised at the 1969 Woodstock Music & Art Festival in Bethel, NY. The Vermont parcel was purchased and managed as a non-profit trust (Earth Peoples Park Inc.), with the land deed officially recorded so as to convey the trusts' 'ownership' of the land (the only real asset of the trust), to 'all of the peoples of the earth'. Due to land surveying errors going back to the settling of that region of the United States and Canada in the late 18th century, the 45th parallel (which was the boundary line set by treaty) actually passes through the acreage several hundred feet to the south of the present-day international boundary vista line, somewhere {{in the vicinity of the}} large <b>hay</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
