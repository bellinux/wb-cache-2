5|$|In June 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber II {{requested}} that the Prosecutor, defendants, and victims comment {{on the possibility of}} holding the confirmation of charges <b>hearings</b> <b>in</b> Kenya rather than in The Hague. This move was supported by Amnesty International, which claimed that holding the <b>hearings</b> <b>in</b> Kenya would bring the justice process closer to victims. The idea of holding the <b>hearings</b> <b>in</b> Kenya was also supported by the defendants Francis Muthaura and Henry Kosgey, with Mathaura suggesting holding the <b>hearings</b> <b>in</b> a military barracks for enhanced security as well as suggesting the possibility of holding the <b>hearings</b> <b>in</b> Arusha, Tanzania, which is the location of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The move was opposed by the Prosecution, who cited security concerns as an obstacle, and also by Ali, Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang who cited the possibility that a change of venue would lead to delays in the trial process in submissions made to the Court. On 29 June Judge Trendafilova ruled that the hearings will take place at the seat of the Court in The Hague.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} of Kenya and the National Assembly both attempted {{to stop the}} ICC process. The government appealed to both the United Nations Security Council and the Court itself regarding the admissibility of the case.

Despite this opposition, the suspects cooperated with the proceedings and attended preliminary <b>hearings</b> <b>in</b> The Hague in April 2011 and confirmation of charges <b>hearings</b> <b>in</b> September of that year. The Pre-Trial Chamber II confirmed the charges against Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang and declined to confirm the charges against Ali, Kosgey, and Muthaura. The trial of Ruto and Sang began on 10 September 2013, while that of Kenyatta is supposed to begin on 5 February 2014. However the Chief prosecuter has asked that the case be adjourned citing lack of enough evidence required for trial.|$|E
