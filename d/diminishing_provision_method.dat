The objective of this research was to develop an intelligent web-based self-service system to support SMMEs in telecommunication service provisioning, using a Design Science Research methodology. A constraint-based, knowledge-based recommender system was selected as the most appropriate intelligent system to support telecommunication service provisioning. A prototype called SelPro was developed as a solution to address the shortcomings of the current ineffective service <b>provisioning</b> <b>methods</b> available for SMMEs. SelPro incorporates an interactive wizard-style user interface with dynamic recommendations to support novice users as well as an expert interface which provides less user support. An expert review and a user study were conducted to determine if SelPro was usable, useful and effective. SelPro was perceived as being usable for SMMEs wishing to purchase telecommunication services. Expert participants were satisfied with the usability of SelPro and perceived it as being useful, easy to use and easy to learn. SelPro was considered effective because of the high task success ratings provided by the participants using the two interfaces. The research determined that intelligent web-based self-service provisioning can be used to effectively support SMMEs in telecommunication service provisioning.

In such applications, circuits are provisioned for end hosts to accomplish data-intensive or QoS-stringent communication tasks. Existing <b>provisioning</b> <b>methods</b> provide point-to-point connectivity for end hosts, that is, an established circuit connects one end host to another, {{and during the}} lifetime of the circuit, only communication tasks between the connected end hosts can be served.

40|$|Abstract. Resource {{allocation}} {{and scheduling}} {{problems in the}} field of cloud computing can be classified into two major groups. The first one is in the area of MapReduce task scheduling. The default scheduler is the FIFO one. Two other schedulers that are available as plug-in for Hadoop: Fair scheduler and Capacity scheduler. We presented recent research in this area to enhance performance or to better suit a specific application. MapReduce scheduling research involves introducing alternative schedulers, or proposing enhancements for existing schedulers such as streaming and input format specification. The second problem is the provisioning of virtual machines and processes to the physical machines and its different resources. We presented the major cloud hypervisors available today. We described the different methods used to solve the resource allocation problem including optimization, simulation, distributed multi-agent systems and SoA. Finally, we presented the related topic of connecting clouds which uses similar resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>methods.</b> The above two scheduling problems are often mixed up, yet they are related.

40|$|Abstract:- Many {{practical}} problems {{are concerned with}} the provision of manufactured components; the provision can be done using three different methods, production in normal and over times, importing/storing, and subcontracting. The decision maker can evaluate the market demand, and the total cost elements. The problem is to determine how many components should be provided using different methods in order to accomplish the required demand and to minimize the total provision cost. A mathematical model for such a problem is formulated. The decision variables represent the number of components to be provided using different methods. The objective function is to minimize the total fixed and variable costs. A special (If-Then) form for the objective function is generated due to the fixed costs associated with some of the <b>provision</b> <b>methods.</b> Another combined (If-Then/Or) form for the objective function is generated due to the fixed cost associated with the subcontracting method. A third special form for the objective function is generated due to the stepped unit prices associated with the subcontracting method. The problem contains many different constraints: the provision of the total demand, the maximum capacity constraints, the overtime conditions, the construction of more prevision lines, the subcontracting stepping prices conditions. The steps of the used algorithm are summarized, and a real example of application is presented, the mathematical model has 9 construction integer decision variables and 11 additional 0 - 1 variables.

40|$|A {{decline in}} alpha-ketoglutarate {{dehydrogenase}} complex (KGDHC) activity {{has been associated}} with neurodegeneration. Provision of succinyl-CoA by KGDHC is essential for generation of matrix ATP (or GTP) by substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl-CoA ligase. Here, we demonstrate ATP consumption in respiration-impaired isolated and in situ neuronal somal mitochondria from transgenic mice with a deficiency of either dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (DLST) or dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLD) that exhibit a 20 - 48 % decrease in KGDHC activity. Import of ATP into the mitochondrial matrix of transgenic mice was attributed to a shift in the reversal potential of the adenine nucleotide translocase toward more negative values due to diminished matrix substrate-level phosphorylation, which causes the translocase to reverse prematurely. Immunoreactivity of all three subunits of succinyl-CoA ligase and maximal enzymatic activity were unaffected in transgenic mice as compared to wild-type littermates. Therefore, decreased matrix substrate-level phosphorylation was due to <b>diminished</b> <b>provision</b> of succinyl-CoA. These results were corroborated further by the finding that mitochondria from wild-type mice respiring on substrates supporting substrate-level phosphorylation exhibited approximately 30 % higher ADP-ATP exchange rates compared to those obtained from DLST+/- or DLD+/- littermates. We propose that KGDHC-associated pathologies are a consequence of the inability of respiration-impaired mitochondria to rely on "in-house" mitochondrial ATP reserves. -Kiss, G., Konrad, C., Doczi, J., Starkov, A.
