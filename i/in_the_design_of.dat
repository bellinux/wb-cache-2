This included its use for the album and singles' cover art, the Billy Idol's Cyberpunk floppy disk, and in the press pack released to the media.|$|E
5|$|Computers {{used in the}} {{development}} of the film were four times faster than those used in The Incredibles and 1,000 times faster than those used in Toy Story. To build the cars, the animators used computer platforms similar to those used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> real-world automobiles.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{conceived}} as an ensemble drama, Chopra's casting {{played a key}} role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the show. Apart from becoming the show's face, and featuring heavily in its publicity campaign, it was specially re-written to center around her as the main character.|$|E
5|$|Instead of the {{seafaring}} assignment {{he hoped}} for, Reynolds {{was sent to}} the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory to assist George Kistiakowsky <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the explosive lenses required by the implosion-type nuclear weapon. In April 1944, Kistiakowsky named Reynolds as one of eleven men {{that he would like to}} have working for him at Los Alamos.|$|E
25|$|Gerard F. Vultee was Lockheed's chief {{engineer}} in 1928 through 1931 and was involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> Lockheed variants {{of that time}} and specifically designed Charles Lindbergh’s Sirius.|$|R
50|$|Conversely, {{numerous}} Central Asian and Persian influences {{were at work}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> Chinese sancai wares: {{pictures of}} Central Asian mounted warriors, scenes representing Central Asian musicians, vases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shape of Middle-Eastern ewers.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1920s, American Robert Goddard was {{developing}} liquid-propellant rockets, which would {{in a few}} brief decades become a critical component <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> such famous rockets as the V-2 and Saturn V.|$|R
5|$|Principles of {{attachment}} theory {{have been used}} to explain adult social behaviours, including mating, social dominance and hierarchical power structures, in-group identification, group coalitions, and negotiation of reciprocity and justice. Those explanations {{have been used to}} design parental care training, and have been particularly successful <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> child abuse prevention programmes.|$|E
5|$|The {{collaboration}} with Ferranti {{eventually led to}} an industrial partnership with the computer company ICL, who made use {{of many of the}} ideas developed at the university, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> their 2900 series of computers during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The overall cargo {{weight is}} the {{limiting}} factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> an ore carrier, since the cargo is so dense. Coal carriers, {{on the other}} hand, are limited by overall volume, since most bulkers can be completely filled with coal before reaching their maximum draft.|$|E
30|$|The {{second problem}} {{may be related to}} <b>the</b> {{difficulty}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>designing</b> <b>of</b> LAMP primers. This problem can be alleviated by using a special software, called Primer Explorer (primerexplorer.jp/e/), which is designed specifically for LAMP primers.|$|R
25|$|Due to its {{historical}} significance, Tiananmen is {{featured on the}} National Emblem of the People's Republic of China. It has also been featured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> stamps and coins issued by the People's Republic of China.|$|R
50|$|Cartoon Network {{became more}} {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aliens than {{the company was}} for '’Ben 10'’. The company along with Boomerang, suggested to the filmmakers that combining aliens be the main draw for the sequel.|$|R
5|$|The style {{continued}} to be popular in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, where it was frequently employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> public and municipal buildings. From {{the latter half of}} the 19th century it was rivalled by the Gothic revival in the English-speaking world, whose champions, such as Augustus Pugin, remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples, deemed it too pagan for Anglican and Anglo-Catholic worship. However, as an architectural style it has {{continued to}} be popular and to evolve; its pediments, symmetry and proportions are clearly evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> many modern buildings today.|$|E
5|$|While Carson {{led the way}} theoretically, Zobel was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> filters {{for the purpose of}} noise reduction on transmission systems.|$|E
5|$|After the war Alvarez was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber that allowed {{his team to}} take millions of photographs of particle interactions, develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new particles and resonance states. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He {{was involved}} in a project to x-ray the Egyptian pyramids to search for unknown chambers. With his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, he developed the Alvarez hypothesis which proposes that the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs was the result of an asteroid impact.|$|E

5|$|After the war Cockcroft {{became the}} {{director}} of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell, where the low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP became the first nuclear reactor to operate in western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by BEPO in 1948. Harwell was involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the reactors and the chemical separation plant at Windscale. Under his direction it took part in frontier fusion research, including the ZETA program. His insistence that the chimney stacks of the Windscale reactors be fitted with filters was mocked as Cockcroft's Folly until the core of one of the reactors ignited and released radionuclides during the Windscale fire of 1957.|$|E
5|$|Also {{on display}} is a burden basket created by basketmaker Sophie George <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the baskets {{used by the}} Kalapuya, the Native American tribe that {{formerly}} inhabited the Tualatin Valley. As few members of the Kalapuya remain and none had the {{knowledge of how to}} make the basket, George visited the British Museum to find an example of a basket in order to design the replica. A bronze cast was created and is displayed at Hillsboro Central. The station also includes a weather vane, {{one of a series of}} eight on the Westside MAX. Designed by Keith Jellum and located on the roof of the station building, the vane resembles old train signals. Constructed of bronze, the semaphore signals stop and approach.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, grills {{were most}} often worn by 18- to 35-year-old African-American male hip-hop listeners, and one {{commentator}} argued that grills will never become mainstream. However, grills received mainstream attention, including on network television, when, during the 2012 Summer Olympics, Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte posed with a grill that sported stones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> an American flag; {{he had previously}} worn diamond grills after earlier competitions.|$|E
25|$|In 1915 Vasnetsov participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>designing</b> <b>of</b> a {{military}} uniform for the Victory parade of Russian army in Berlin and Constantinopole. Vasnetsov {{is credited with}} the creation of the budenovka (initially named bogatyrka), {{a military}} hat reproducing the style of ancient Rus' cone-shaped helmets.|$|R
50|$|He got {{his first}} break in BMW in 1998 working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>designing</b> <b>of</b> {{exterior}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BMW 7 series. He left to work for Mercedes in 2009 {{for a few years}} and came back to BMW in 2011 as exterior designer until January 2017.|$|R
50|$|Barry Byrne left Seattle {{early in}} 1913, moving first to California and {{eventually}} {{returning to the}} Midwest. Byrne had a long and celebrated career, mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>designing</b> <b>of</b> Catholic churches. Our Lady of Good Help (1910) in Hoquiam, Washington, {{appears to be the}} first of this line.|$|R
5|$|As well as {{the unique}} motion-based {{gameplay}} mechanics, the Wii version of the game also supports the GameCube controller, and also the option of using the Classic Controller. The daytime levels for the Wii were altered to accommodate the motion control-based boost mechanic, while night-time levels include a mostly behind-the-back view and different platforming styles and combat mechanics. Developer Dimps, who had past involvement in the Sonic franchise, was involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the daytime areas for these versions. In addition, overall, the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions have fewer daytime levels than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 counterparts.|$|E
5|$|At the Pierre Levasseur Company in Paris, Nungesser and Coli, {{working closely}} with Chief Engineer Émile Farret and {{production}} manager Albert Longelot, assisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the new Levasseur PL.8 biplane. Based on the Levasseur PL.4 developed for the Aéronavale to operate from the French aircraft carrier Béarn, the PL.8 was a conventional, single-bay, wood and fabric-covered biplane that carried a crew of two in a side-by-side, open cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} conservatism, in 1963 Brabham {{was the first}} Formula One team to use a wind tunnel to hone their designs to reduce drag and stop the cars lifting off the ground at speed. The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly {{the most important factor}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> modern cars. Towards the end of the 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic downforce to push the cars' tyres down harder on the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.|$|E
50|$|Aestropolus {{has only}} {{appeared}} twice in ancient affidavit. In both cases, he was mentioned in texts about Ictinus, a Greek architect. Aestropolus {{was said to}} have helped with Ictinus’ architecture, which means he may have helped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>designing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Parthenon, a Greek temple of great significance.|$|R
50|$|He {{assisted}} Charles François de Mondion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> Fort Manoel, and {{was responsible}} for major decorative additions at the palace of the Grand Master {{during the reign of}} Zondadari. Together with Antonio Azzopardi, he oversaw the construction of the Manoel Theatre to <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> Romano Carapecchia in 1731-32.|$|R
40|$|Computational Aerodynamics plays a {{dominant}} role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> phases <b>of</b> aircraft. By a proper choice of computational tools, {{backed up by}} experimental data base, considerable savings can accrue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> expensive wind tunnel testing required <b>in</b> <b>the</b> various stages of aircraft development. CFD can thus play a synergic role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> cycle <b>of</b> an aircraft...|$|R
