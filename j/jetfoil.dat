25|$|Colquhoun {{was soon}} testing the new Hovercraft being {{produced}} by Vickers {{and went on}} to become operations manager of Vickers' Hovercraft division. In 1962 Colquhoun piloted a Vickers VA-3 on the first public hovercraft service which was between Wallasey and Rhyl. In 1966 he joined Hoverlloyd as operational manager for the cross channel hovercraft service, he later becoming managing director. When Hoverlloyd was taken over by Seaspeed he then ran their <b>jetfoil</b> service to Dieppe.|$|E
25|$|Boeing also {{developed}} hydrofoils in the 1960s. The screw-driven USS High Point (PCH-1) was an experimental submarine hunter. The patrol hydrofoil USS Tucumcari (PGH-2) was more successful. Only one was built, but it saw service in Vietnam and Europe before running aground in 1972. Its waterjet and fully submersed flying foils were the {{example for the}} later Pegasus-class patrol hydrofoils and the Model 929 <b>Jetfoil</b> ferries in the 1980s. The Tucumcari and later boats were produced in Renton. While the Navy hydrofoils were withdrawn from service in the late 1980s, the Boeing Jetfoils are still in service in Asia.|$|E

5000|$|A SeaJet service {{ran from}} the Marina to Dieppe in France between 1979 and 1980. Two Boeing <b>Jetfoils</b> were used, with three [...] "flights" [...] per day. The service {{suffered}} from poor reliability of the <b>Jetfoils</b> in the early stages, was restricted due to mid-channel wave height, and suffered during the French fishermen's blockade of channel ports.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to traditional car ferries, RMT also operated two Boeing <b>Jetfoils</b> (for foot-passengers only) that reduced crossing times from 4 hours to 100 minutes.|$|R
500|$|While passing east of Hong Kong, {{the outer}} rainbands of Chanchu dropped [...] of {{rainfall}} at Sha Tin. Sustained winds {{in the territory}} reached , while gusts reached , both recorded at Tate's Cairn. Chanchu produced a storm surge of , causing minor flooding, sinking a yacht, and injuring one person who was swept into the sea. The storm downed several trees and damaged some scaffolding. Six people were injured in the territory, including three on a <b>jetfoil</b> bound for Macau.|$|E
2500|$|The Tucumcari (PGH-2) was a Boeing-built hydrofoil. Named after Tucumcari, New Mexico, it was {{the basis}} for the {{technology}} used in the subsequent [...] Pegasus-class patrol boats and the <b>Jetfoil</b> ferries. Its unique feature was a waterjet propulsion and a computer-controlled fully submerged foil configuration of one foil at the bow and foils on the port and starboard sides. The Tucumcari was one of two prototype boats contracted by the Navy for the purpose of evaluating the latest hydrofoil technology. The second boat was the rival Grumman built USS Flagstaff (PGH-1).|$|E
50|$|In North America, the Boeing <b>Jetfoil</b> saw {{regularly}} scheduled service between Seattle, Washington and Victoria, British Columbia {{during the summer}} tourist season of 1980. Leased from Boeing, a single <b>Jetfoil,</b> the Flying Princess, was operated by the non-profit Flying Princess Transportation Corp., with the close co-operation and assistance of the B.C. Steamship Company. Regularly scheduled service ran from Seattle to Victoria to Vancouver from April to September, 1985, by Island <b>Jetfoil.</b> Boeing reclaimed the Island <b>Jetfoil</b> boat and sold it for service in Japan.|$|E

50|$|The Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal between Central and Sheung Wan and the China Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui provide {{centralised}} ferry {{services to}} Macau and 24 ports on mainland China. About 100 vessels, mostly high-speed passenger craft such as <b>jetfoils,</b> catamarans and hoverferries, operate from these terminals. In 2001, over 17 million passengers {{passed through the}} terminals, comprising approximately 11.2 million passenger trips to/from Macau and 6.5 million passenger trips to/from mainland ports.|$|R
50|$|Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation (Kawasaki Jūkōgyō Senpaku Kaiyō Kanpanī) is the {{shipbuilding}} {{subsidiary of}} Kawasaki Heavy Industries. It produces primarily specialized commercial vessels, including LNG carriers, LPG carriers, container ships, bulk carriers, oil tankers, {{as well as}} high speed passenger <b>jetfoils.</b> In addition, {{it is also a}} producer of warships for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, including submarines. Kawasaki also produces marine machinery, including marine engines, thrusters, steering gears, deck and fishing machinery.|$|R
50|$|Ferry {{services}} are provided to Macau by two companies, {{both of which}} {{use a variety of}} designs of fast ferries, including catamarans and Boeing <b>Jetfoils.</b> TurboJET provides service to the Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, in central Macau. Cotai Water Jet operate to the Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal on the Taipa island, which enables easy access to The Venetian Macao casino and Macau International Airport. Both operators run services every 30 minutes, or more frequently, during the day, with TurboJET providing a limited overnight service. The journey time is approximately one hour.|$|R

5000|$|They are {{technically}} {{complex and}} require high maintenance, which has {{put an end}} to most military hydrofoil projects. The US Navy, for example, developed some of the most technically advanced hydrofoils, but could not make the complex propulsion systems and ride control reliable. This eventually led to the suspension of their hydrofoil projects. Most other Navy developments met the same fate. The Russian Navy still operates very large hydrofoils and have been successful—largely because they opted for simpler systems that might not have the same performance as the US designs but are more robust and reliable. In Hong Kong, increasing maintenance cost of keeping the old <b>jetfoils</b> running is resulting in these vessels slowly being phased out.|$|R
50|$|Ho, {{along with}} partners, {{including}} Hong Kong tycoon Henry Fok, Macau gambler Yip Hon and his brother-in-law Teddy Yip, bid for Macau franchises. By bidding high and promising to promote tourism {{and to develop}} infrastructure, they won the public tender for Macau's gaming monopoly {{at a cost of}} approximately (US?)$410,000, defeating the longtime Macau casino barons, the Fu family. In 1961 the company was renamed Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau, S.A.R.L. (STDM). Business at its flagship Lisboa Casino Hotel blossomed, the hotel later to become well-known internationally. In the same year, Ho also set up Shun Tak Holdings Ltd, which was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Through a subsidiary, TurboJET, it owns one of the world's largest fleets of high-speed <b>jetfoils,</b> which ferries passengers between Hong Kong and Macau.|$|R
5000|$|Over 150 sea-crossing {{services}} are scheduled daily between Macau and Hong Kong, and the Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal {{serves as the}} major terminal for Macau's passenger traffic by sea. The route is served by high speed catamarans (with passenger capacity of about 400) and <b>jetfoils</b> (with passenger capacity of about 260) and the journey takes approximately one hour. There are also daily scheduled ferry services between Macau and Shenzhen. At present the {{services are}} operated by TurboJET from Sheung Wan, Tsim Sha Tsui and Hong Kong International Airport. Cotai Water Jet also operates services between Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal and the Hong Kong - Macau Ferry Terminal, Hong Kong, Tsim Sha Tsui and Hong Kong International Airport [...] Apart from the sea routes there are also regular scheduled helicopter services between Hong Kong and Macau, which are operated by Sky Shuttle. The trip takes approximately 20 minutes.|$|R

50|$|In 1979, the Royal Navy {{purchased}} a Boeing <b>Jetfoil,</b> HMS Speedy, {{to provide the}} Royal Navy {{with an opportunity to}} gain practical experience in the operation and support of a modern hydrofoil, to establish technical and performance characteristics, and to assess the capability of a hydrofoil in the Fishery Protection Squadron.|$|E
50|$|On 25 April 1980 a <b>jetfoil</b> {{service from}} Dublin to Liverpool started but was {{withdrawn}} {{as it was}} not a commercial success. The company ran into major financial problems in 1981, this and labour disputes persisted into the early 1992 when the company was privatised and taken over by the Irish Continental Group.|$|E
50|$|There were {{land and}} air {{vehicles}} - {{in the first}} stories, cars conform to styling of the time, while some flying machines {{were based on the}} design of helicopters of the mid-twentieth century. Also of note was Lex O'Malley's ship, the Poseidon, a versatile craft that could operate as a <b>jetfoil</b> as well as a submarine.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technology}} was first pioneered by the , where it successfully operated in Vietnam, but ultimately ran aground off Puerto Rico. It was {{judged to be}} more advanced than the Grumman [...] which was built {{at the same time}} to the same requirements. The primary technology, also used in the Boeing <b>Jetfoil</b> ferries, used submerged flying foils with waterjet propulsion.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} {{approximately}} eight miles (8 mi) {{in length and}} tipped up towards the west. The west coast is dominated by steep white, chalky cliffs that are greatly eroded at sea level, and harbour many 'blue caves', which can be explored on launches departing from Gaios. Much of the attractive landscape is still covered in olive groves. These stretch from Lakka, the harbour community in the north, through Magazia to Gaios, the capital. Olive oil making, soap manufacture and fishing were supplanted by tourism as the main industry in the mid sixties, resulting in a construction boom, which has greatly altered the coastline around Gaios, {{the capital of the}} Paxiot demos (community). There are ferry and <b>jetfoil</b> connections daily with Kerkyra (Corfu) and with the mainland at Igoumenitsa. Excursions via Corfu to Albania (the resort of Saranda and the magnificent Greco-Roman settlement of Butrint) can also be arranged with the local <b>jetfoil</b> operators.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrofoils are {{expensive}} to build. A vessel like the Boeing <b>Jetfoil</b> currently costs {{about three times}} the price of an equivalent catamaran passenger ferry. The increased costs are not always economically justifiable by consumers. Simpler designs {{such as those of}} Russian design and those by Rodriquez in Italy are more competitive in price and are still being produced today for operation on ferry routes.|$|E
