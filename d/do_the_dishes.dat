50|$|Most {{self-service}} huts have solar panels, {{and therefore}} electricity, but no running water, {{so they are}} usually located very close to a river from which buckets may be filled.

5000|$|However, {{the meaning}} of the {{linguistic}} means used (if ever there are linguistic means, for at least some so-called [...] "speech acts" [...] can be performed non-verbally) may also be different from the content intended to be communicated. One may, in appropriate circumstances, request Peter to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> by just saying, [...] "Peter ...!", or one can promise to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> by saying, [...] "Me!" [...] One common way of performing speech acts is to use an expression which indicates one speech act, and indeed performs this act, but also performs a further speech act, which is indirect. One may, for instance, say, [...] "Peter, can you close the window?", thereby asking Peter whether {{he will be able to}} close the window, but also requesting that he does so. Since the request is performed indirectly, by means of (directly) performing a question, it counts as an indirect speech act.|$|E

30|$|The imperfective aspect {{regulates the}} {{relation}} between the situation time (e.g., the time when Lisi is washing <b>dishes)</b> and <b>the</b> topic time (e.g., 現在 xianzai 'now'): the latter must be included in the former (Klein 1994). In other words, the state is required to hold through the topic time. Notice that the topic time is encoded as a variable (henceforth, tTop) in the aspect marker and its reference is left unspecified until TP, where the topic time is merged. For example, in 38, AspP denotes that <b>the</b> state of <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> holds through tTop, and its value is assigned as now when xianzai is merged in the TP later, yielding the meaning that this state holds through now. That is, Lisi is <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> now.|$|R
