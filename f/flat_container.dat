40|$|Nucleation is {{of great}} concern in many cases—for example, the {{production}} of artificial rainfall and the synthesis of advanced amorphous alloys. Although exact solutions have been well known to both homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation occurring on a large <b>flat</b> <b>container</b> wall, yet in more general situations the actual nucleation takes place around finite-sized heterogeneous particles. The understanding of nucleation in such situations requires a more extended model which considers the size effect of nucleating agents. Partially motivated by our research on bulk metallic glasses, we construct such a geometric model. Also we derive an exact solution to the model and discuss briefly its physical implications.

40|$|The {{depletion}} interaction as induced between colloids by {{the addition}} of a polymer depletant {{is one of the few}} ways in which short-ranged attractions between particles can be controlled. Due to these tunable interactions, colloid-polymer mixtures have contributed to a better understanding of the role of attractions both in equilibrium phenomena such as phase transitions and liquid surfaces as well as in systems out of equilibrium such as gelation and the glass transition. It is known that, by simple geometric effects, surface roughness decreases the strength of the depletion interaction. In this study, we demonstrate both by Monte Carlo simulations and experiments that it is possible to generate enough difference in attraction strength to induce phase separation in smooth particles but not in rough particles. Roughness was induced by coating smooth particles with smaller spherical colloids. We indicate how effective potentials can be obtained through simulations and how the interplay between gravity and the depletion interaction with a <b>flat</b> <b>container</b> wall can be used to obtain a simple measure of the interaction strengths as a function of roughness...|$|E

A layer several grain-sizes thick is formed and then densified by compression. The layer is then sintered by heating for about 1 minute at 1350 - 1400 deg. C resulting in a layer of 300 - 1000 micron thickness which is self-supporting. The heating is single-sided and uses radiation by halogen lamps of at least 6 KW in an ambient of Argon. The lamp is fitted inside a reflector with an elliptical cross-section to focus the light in a narrow strip on the substrate. This is followed by another heat-treatment in which {{at least half of the}} thickness of the foil is molten where it is irradiated and recrystallises when it moves out of this area. In a third heat-treatment the other part of the foil is treated similarly and grains are formed which equal the thickness of the foil in size. This process can be carried out on a moving belt principle using 3 heat sources with reflectors if the third source is placed below the foil. USE/ADVANTAGE - The process does not introduce contamination like current processes do because no binder is used.

40|$|Loads {{acting on}} ship {{structures}} {{are complex and}} randomly over time and the nonlinear effect caused by wave loading {{is one of the}} research focus. The linear and nonlinear vertical wave bending moment (VBM) in different speeds and sea states and their effects on ship structural fatigue strength were investigated for a <b>flat</b> <b>container</b> with high ratio of width to depth. The VBM under the linear regular waves and irregular waves were calculated based on the three dimension (3 D) potential theory. The considered nonlinear wave loading was caused by sea pressure near the mean free surface as well as the geometric nonlinearity. Hydrodynamic calculations in regular wave were presented to figure out the frequency response function (FRF) of VBM in the mid-ship section. Irregular waves were verified to obtain the VBM history in 4 sea states. What’s more, VBMs from a segmented elastic model test were obtained to investigate the influence of nonlinearity. On the basis of the wave loadings obtained from simulation and test, the hotspot stress histories under irregular waves were deduced in time domain by using the beam theory. Fatigue cumulative damage per hour under several random sea states were obtained {{on the basis of the}} rain-flow counting and S-N curve. Based on the fatigue damage from the numerical analysis and model test, it is believed that speeds and significant wave height have a positive correlation with the fatigue damage of ship structures. A good agreement was obtained between the numerical analysis values and the low frequency part of the test and the nonlinear analysis in the simulation could offer reasonable prediction for the fatigue damage caused by the wave frequency response. Also shown as the test result, fully nonlinearities have a great contribution to the fatigue damage...|$|E

Two methodology of biomass processing extending contact biomass with air space including distribution of fungal material on surface of hygroscopic paper and starch packaging peanuts were investigated.

40|$|We {{study the}} destabilization of a shear layer, {{produced}} by differential rotation of a rotating axisymmetric container. For small forcing, this produces a shear layer, {{which has been}} studied by Stewartson and is almost invariant along the rotation axis. When the forcing increases, instabilities develop. To study the asymptotic regime (very low Ekman number E), we develop a quasi-geostrophic two-dimensional model, whose main original feature is to handle the mass conservation correctly, resulting in a divergent two-dimensional flow, and valid for any container provided that {{the top and bottom}} have finite slopes. We use it to derive scalings and asymptotic laws by a simple linear theory, extending the previous analyses to large slopes (as in a sphere), for which we find different scaling laws. For a <b>flat</b> <b>container,</b> the critical Rossby number for the onset of instability evolves as E^ 3 / 4 and may be understood as a Kelvin-Helmoltz shear instability. For a sloping container, the instability is a Rossby wave with a critical Rossby number proportional to β E^ 1 / 2, where β is related to the slope. We also investigate the asymmetry between positive and negative differential rotation and propose corrections for finite Ekman and Rossby numbers. Implemented in a numerical code, our model allows us to study the onset over a broad range of parameters, determining the threshold but also other features such as the spatial structure. We also present a few experimental results, validating our model and showing its limits.

40|$|Non-ferrous (NF) {{metals in}} {{municipal}} solid waste incineration bottom ash are mostly recovered by an eddy current separator (ECS) to retrieve the positive economic value and to strongly improve the environmental quality of the mineral ash contents before reusing them in road foundations or other applications. The splitter in an ECS is a metal plate that splits the falling product stream of the ECS in a mineral product and a NF metal product. Variations such as moisture content in the feed of the ECS make it necessary to continuously make adjustments to the splitter position in order to achieve the highest possible value recovery. The main research idea in this work is to adjust the splitter continuously by means of a sensor that can count both the metal particles as well as all the particles in the falling materials stream into the metals product. In this work the gain in recovery and retrieved value provided by the sensor was investigated and a preferred strategy is proposed to control the splitter by means of the information generated by the sensor. Particle trajectory tests were conducted to evaluate the changes in the trajectories due to variations in the bottom ash (BA) feed and to assess the possible consequences of these feed changes for metal recovery. The feed material used in the tests was the 1 - 6 mm size fraction, since ECS metal recovery from this fine fraction is the biggest challenge. The falling material stream from the ECS was intercepted by a 60 mm deep, <b>flat</b> <b>container</b> that was subdivided into multiple rectangular slots of 10 mm width. The material collected during 3 to 8 seconds of ECS processing was dried, weighted and classified and the NF metal particles in the different size fractions were analysed. Results from the ECS particle tests were used to simulate the system of ECS and sensor to assess how a sensor system would respond to variations in the BA. Optimal economic value recovery in the metal product is achieved at 29 - 32 % metal product grade, which complies with 6 % sensor grade. This sensor grade is measured by the sensor as it samples the falling materials stream through a 30 mm tube at the position of the splitter. A special result is that this optimum holds for both feed with 12 % moisture and feed with 14 % moisture. The count ratio of metal particles to all particles (z) was z= 0. 12 for both feed with 12 % moisture and feed with 14 % moisture content and the average particle mass ratio of non-metal to metal (k) was k= 1. 3 for feed with 12 % moisture and k= 1. 7 for feed with 14 % moisture. A reduction in moisture content of 2 % will require an adjustment of 25 mm of the splitter away from the ECS to maintain the optimal economic value of the metal product. Vice versa, a 2 % increase in moisture will require an adjustment of 25 mm of the splitter towards the ECS. The sensor grade, metal product grade and the count ratio all showed a monotonically increasing behaviour with increasing splitter distance, giving the ideal conditions for reliable automated control of the splitter by a the desired value-optimizing criteria. Simulations of ECS behaviour for different splitter positions showed that the sensor can add value to the metal product when compared to a human operator, who would adjust the splitter perhaps a few times per day, which is the common practice in industry. This conclusion holds for both feed with 12 % and 14 % moisture content, but the gain increases when the feed material becomes wetter. Moreover, control of the splitter as based on the sensor readings shows that the theoretical optimal value recovery in the metal product can be realized using the sensor.

To determine whether this water contains Legionella pneumophila, we collected samples from roads. We found that L. pneumophila are abundant in these puddles, especially during warm weather. Legionella pneumophila bacteria are {{a major cause of}} severe community-acquired pneumonia; in recent years the numbers of reported cases of legionellosis have increased substantially where testing is available (e. g., United States, Europe, Japan). However, the source and mode of transmission for sporadic cases are often obscure. Several studies have indicated an association between rain and legionellosis (1 – 5). We recently reported a case of legionellosis in a commercial truck driver in Japan who became infected during the rainy season (6, 7).
