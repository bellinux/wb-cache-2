5|$|In a {{gas-filled}} tube, xenon <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> blue or lavenderish glow when {{excited by}} electrical discharge. Xenon <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> band of emission lines that span the visual spectrum, {{but the most}} intense lines occur {{in the region of}} blue light, producing the coloration.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel {{has four}} basic vocalisations; a {{guttural}} hiss emitted when alarmed, which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked. When defensive, it <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> shrill wail or squeal. During encounters {{between males and}} females or between a mother and kits, the least weasel <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> high-pitched trilling. The least weasel's way of expressing aggression {{is similar to that of}} the stoat. Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals.|$|E
5|$|An {{active galaxy}} is a {{formation}} that <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> {{significant amount of}} its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It {{is powered by a}} compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.|$|E
50|$|They {{were named}} Banshee {{because of the}} sound their {{spacecraft}} made. When hovering they <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> low throbbing sound akin to baaaan-baaaan-baaaan, and when they take-off they <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> sound like a whooshing sheeeeee. Hence the name Baaan-sheee.|$|R
50|$|Water {{deer are}} capable of <b>emitting</b> <b>a</b> number of sounds. The main call is a bark, and this has more of a growl tone when {{compared}} with the sharper yap of a muntjac. The bark is used as an alarm, and water deer will bark repeatedly at people and at each other for reasons unknown. If challenged during the rut, <b>a</b> buck will <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> clicking sound. It is uncertain how this unique sound is generated, although it is possibly by using its molar teeth. During the rut a buck following a doe will make a weak whistle or squeak. The does <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> soft pheep to call to their fawns, whilst an injured deer will <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> screaming wail.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the time}} domain, while mode-locked lasers almost always <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> series of short pulses, Kerr {{frequency}} combs generally do not. However, a special sub-type of Kerr frequency comb, {{in which a}} [...] "cavity soliton" [...] forms in the microresonator, does <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> series of pulses.|$|R
5|$|Beetles have {{a variety}} of ways to communicate, {{including}} the use of pheromones. The mountain pine beetle <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> pheromone to attract other beetles to a tree. The mass of beetles are able to overcome the chemical defenses of the tree. After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, the beetles emit an anti-aggregation pheromone. The species can stridulate to communicate.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, the Jeita cave <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> {{spring with}} a flow ranging from 1–2m3/s, {{providing}} fresh drinking water for one-and-a-half million {{inhabitants of the}} capital, Beirut. However, water pollution, due to domestic and agricultural runoff, remains a serious concern as recent analysis detected an increasing presence of coliform bacteria.|$|E
5|$|The sea-firefly {{is a small}} {{crustacean}} {{living in}} sediment. At rest it <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> dull glow but when disturbed it darts away leaving a cloud of shimmering blue light to confuse the predator. During World War II it was gathered and dried {{for use by the}} Japanese military as a source of light during clandestine operations.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to an ordinary market, in a pollution market the amount purchased {{is not necessarily}} the amount 'consumed' (= the amount of pollution <b>emitted).</b> <b>A</b> firm might buy a small amount of allowances but <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> much larger amount of pollution. This creates a troublesome moral hazard problem.|$|R
60|$|Du Lhut laughed heartily, without, however, <b>emitting</b> <b>a</b> sound.|$|R
50|$|Indium-111 decays by {{electron}} capture to cadmium-111, <b>emitting</b> <b>a</b> 0.1713 and 0.2454 MeV gamma rays with a 2.8047 day radioactive half-life. The parent isotope of indium-111 is tin-111, with a decay mode of {{electron capture}}. Indium-111 also undergoes isomeric transition, <b>emitting</b> <b>a</b> 0.537 MeV gamma ray with a 7.7 minute half-life.|$|R
5|$|An anchor from Fitzgerald lost on {{an earlier}} trip was {{recovered}} from the Detroit River and is {{on display at the}} Dossin Great Lakes Museum in Detroit, Michigan. The Dossin Great Lakes Museum also hosts a Lost Mariners Remembrance event each year on the evening of November 10. Artifacts on display in the Steamship Valley Camp museum in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, include two lifeboats, photos, a movie of Fitzgerald and commemorative models and paintings. Every November 10, the Split Rock Lighthouse in Silver Bay, Minnesota <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> light in honor of Edmund Fitzgerald.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are monogamous {{and usually}} bond for life, though new pairings may follow a {{fatality}} of one individual. A feature of a bonded couple is the synchronous calling which the female usually initiates. She stands with her wings folded and beak {{pointed to the}} sky and <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> series of trumpeting calls. The male stands alongside in a similar posture but with his wings flared and primaries drooping. He emits one longer call for every two emitted by the female.|$|E
5|$|Helping Alisia in her quest are her pet monsters. These creatures {{fly around}} the heroine on their own, attacking her foes, and {{blocking}} enemy attacks from hitting her. There are four pets, {{each with its}} own type of attack. The Dragon Frye spits fireballs, and the Boomerang Lizard hurls boomerangs. The Thunder Raven <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> thunder blast that affects enemies across the screen, and the Ball O' Fire burns enemies on contact. Only one pet can fight alongside Alisia in her quest, but the player can select any of the four (or none) as the active companion at any time.|$|E

5|$|In the present, Fox Mulder and Alex Krycek {{return to}} the United States, but are run off the road by another vehicle. The assailants attempt to {{apprehend}} Krycek, but are severely injured when he <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> flashing light. The Smoking Man sees their bodies and orders their destruction. Mulder, who was knocked unconscious in the crash, awakens in the hospital. Dana Scully tells Mulder about Walter Skinner's condition, and says that an analysis of saliva has identified his shooter as the same person who killed her sister Melissa.|$|E
5|$|Little brown bats produce {{calls that}} are high {{intensity}} frequency modulated (FM) and that last {{from less than}} one millisecond (ms) to about 5 ms and have a sweep rate of 80–40kHz, with most of their energy at 45kHz. Bats usually emit 20 calls per second when in flight. When pursuing prey, a bat emits 200 calls per second. It also <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> high-pulse repetitive call {{if it wants to}} land.|$|E
5|$|MagSafe, a {{magnetic}} charging connector, {{has been replaced}} with USB-C charging. Unlike MagSafe, which provided an indicator light within the user’s field of view to indicate the device's charging status, the USB-C charger has no visual indicator. Instead, the MacBook Pro <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> chime when connected to power. The Macintosh startup chime {{that has been used}} since the first Macintosh in 1984 is now disabled by default. The laptop now boots automatically when the lid is opened.|$|E
5000|$|Ultra-Smokescreen Taro can <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> six-colored {{smokescreen}} {{to blind}} his foes.|$|R
50|$|Ion {{thrusters}} <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> beam {{of positive}} charged xenon ions only. To avoid charging up the spacecraft, another cathode is placed near {{the engine to}} <b>emit</b> <b>an</b> electron current into the ion beam with net neutral electrostatic charge. This prevents the beam of ions from being attracted (and returning) to the spacecraft, cancelling the thrust.|$|R

5|$|The isotope plutonium-238 has a {{half-life}} of 87.74years. It <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> {{large amount}} of thermal energy {{with low levels of}} both gamma rays/photons and spontaneous neutron rays/particles. Being an alpha emitter, it combines high energy radiation with low penetration and thereby requires minimal shielding. A sheet of paper can be used to shield against the alpha particles emitted by plutonium-238. One kilogram of the isotope can generate about 570 watts of heat.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater {{on the far side of}} the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.|$|E

60|$|Mills <b>emitted</b> <b>an</b> {{enormous}} {{cloud of}} smoke out of his distended cheeks.|$|R
5|$|The tremolo call—sometimes {{called the}} “laughing” call—is {{characterized}} by its short, wavering quality. It often uses this call to signal distress or alarm caused by territorial disputes or perceived threats. It <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> tremulous series {{of up to}} 10 rather high notes (hu)-heheheheheheha. It also uses the tremolo to communicate its presence to other loons when they arrive at a lake, often when they are flying overhead. It is the only vocalization used in flight. The tremolo call has varying three levels of intensities that correlate with a loon’s level of distress, and the types are differentiated by increasingly higher pitch frequencies added to the call.|$|E
5|$|Curium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{radioactive}} isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes 242Cm and 244Cm are strong alpha emitters (energy 6MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively. Therefore, curium can be used in its common oxide form in radioisotope thermoelectric generators like those in spacecraft. This application has been studied for the 244Cm isotope, while 242Cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price of around 2000 USD/g. 243Cm with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could make for a suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful gamma and beta radiation from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, 244Cm requires a much thinner radiation protection shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing thermoelectric generator isotope such as 238Pu, 244Cm <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> 500-fold greater fluence of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2inches of lead for a 1kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for 238Pu. Therefore, this application of curium is currently considered impractical.|$|E
5|$|Sirius is {{a binary}} star system {{consisting}} of two white stars orbiting {{each other with a}} separation of about 20 AU (roughly the distance between the Sun and Uranus) and a period of 50.1 years. The brighter component, termed Sirius A, is a main-sequence star of spectral type early A, with an estimated surface temperature of 9,940K. Its companion, Sirius B, is a star that has already evolved off the main sequence and become a white dwarf. Currently 10,000 times less luminous in the visual spectrum, Sirius B was once the more massive of the two. The age of the system has been estimated at around 230 million years. Early in its lifespan it was thought to have been two bluish white stars orbiting each other in an elliptical orbit every 9.1 years. The system <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> higher than expected level of infrared radiation, as measured by IRAS space-based observatory. This may be an indication of dust in the system, and is considered somewhat unusual for a binary star. The Chandra X-ray Observatory image shows Sirius B outshining its bright partner as it is a brighter X-ray source.|$|E
50|$|In Italy {{as well as}} some jurisdictions in the US, {{traffic lights}} {{inactive}} at nighttime <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> yellow-coloured flashing signal in directions owing priority while the intersecting street <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> flashing red light, requiring drivers to stop before proceeding. In Germany the priority directions will not be illuminated while the intersecting streets will be shown a flashing yellow signal.|$|R
