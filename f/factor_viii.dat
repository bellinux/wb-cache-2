5|$|Ryan White {{was born}} at St. Joseph Memorial Hospital in Kokomo, Indiana, to Hubert Wayne and Jeanne Elaine (Hale) White. When he was circumcised, the {{bleeding}} would not stop. When he was three days old, doctors diagnosed him with severe hemophilia A, a hereditary blood coagulation disorder associated with the X chromosome, which causes even minor injuries to result in severe bleeding. For treatment, he received weekly infusions of <b>Factor</b> <b>VIII,</b> a blood product created from pooled plasma of non-hemophiliacs, an increasingly common treatment for hemophiliacs at the time.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{coagulation}} is {{initiated by}} the release of tissue factor from damaged tissue. Tissue factor binds to circulating factor VIIa. The combination activates factor X to factor Xa and factor IX to factor IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of factor V) activates prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process: it generates fibrin from fibrinogen, and activates {{a number of other}} enzymes and cofactors (factor XIII, factor XI, factor V and <b>factor</b> <b>VIII,</b> TAFI) that enhance the fibrin clot. The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by factor VIIa/tissue factor), antithrombin (which inactivates thrombin, factor IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and protein Z (which inhibits factor Xa).|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and <b>factor</b> <b>VIII.</b> Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E
50|$|In {{people with}} {{hemophilia}} type A and B {{who have a}} deficiency of <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and IX, these two factors are administered for controlling bleeding or as prophylaxis medication before starting surgeries. However, {{in some cases they}} subsequently develop neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against the drug. These NAbs increase over time and inhibit the action of coagulation in the body. rFVIIa, which is an activated form of factor VII, bypasses <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and IX and causes coagulation without the need for <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and IX. It is important for some patients to shift to proper blood factors according to their level of NAbs. Other indications include use for patients with acquired hemophilia, people born with a deficiency of factor VII, and people with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and IX {{on the ability}} of the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex to {{activate}} factor X was studied in a continuous-flow tubular enzyme reactor. Tissue factor immobilized in a phospholipid bilayer on the inner surface of the tube was exposed to a perfusate containing <b>factors</b> VIIa, <b>VIII,</b> IX, and X flowing at a shear rate of 57, 300, or 1130 sec- 1. Factor Xa in the effluent was determined by chromogenic assay. The flux of factor Xa (moles formed per unit surface area per unit time) was strongly dependent on wall shear rate, increasing about 3 -fold as wall shear rate increased from 57 to 1130 sec- 1. The addition of <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and IX at their respective plasma concentrations resulted in a further 2 - to 3 -fold increase. The direct activation of factor X by tissue factor-factor VIIa could be virtually eliminated by the lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor; however, when <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and IX were present at their approximate plasma concentrations, factor Xa production rates were enhanced 15 - to 20 -fold. These results suggest that the tissue factor pathway, mediated through <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and IX, produces significant levels of factor Xa even in the presence of an inhibitor of the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex; moreover, the activation is dependent on local shear conditions. These findings are consistent both with a model of blood coagulation in which initiation of the system results from tissue factor and with the bleeding observed in hemophilia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFactor VIII is a {{critical}} member of the blood coagulation cascade. It binds to the membrane surfaces of activated platelets {{at the site of}} vascular injury via a highly specific interaction between <b>factor</b> <b>VIII's</b> carboxy-terminal C 2 domain and their phosphatidylserine-rich lipid bilayer. We have identified small-molecule inhibitors of <b>factor</b> <b>VIII's</b> membrane binding activity that have IC 50 values as low as 2. 5 μM. This interaction is approximately 103 -fold tighter than that of free o-phospho-L-serine. These compounds also inhibit factor VIII-dependent activation of factor X, indicating that disruption of membrane lipid binding leads to inhibition of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. The tightest binding inhibitor is specific and does not prevent membrane binding by the closely related coagulation factor V. These results indicate that this and related compounds may be used as leads to develop novel antithrombotic agents...|$|R
5|$|Ryan Wayne White (December 6, 1971– April 8, 1990) was an American {{teenager}} from Kokomo, Indiana, {{who became}} a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after failing to be re-admitted to school following an AIDS diagnosis. As a hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment (<b>Factor</b> <b>VIII)</b> and, when diagnosed in December 1984, was given six months to live. Doctors said he posed no risk to other students, but AIDS was poorly understood {{by the general public}} at the time. When Ryan tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in Howard County rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer. A lengthy administrative appeal process ensued, and news of the conflict turned Ryan into a popular celebrity and advocate for AIDS research and public education. Surprising his doctors, Ryan White lived five years longer than predicted but died in April 1990, one month before his high school graduation.|$|E
5|$|The disease term venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) {{includes the}} development of either DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). Genetic factors that {{increase the risk of}} VTE include deficiencies of three proteins that normally prevent blood from clotting—protein C, protein S, and antithrombin—in addition to non-O blood type and mutations in the factor V and prothrombin genes. Deficiencies in antithrombin, protein C, and protein S are rare but strong, or moderately strong, risk factors. These three thrombophilia increase the risk of VTE by about 10 times. Factor V Leiden, which makes factor V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C, and the genetic variant prothrombin G20210A, which causes increased prothrombin levels, are predominantly expressed in Caucasians. They moderately increase risk for VTE, by three to eight times for factor V Leiden and two to three times for prothrombin G20210A. Having a non-O blood type roughly doubles VTE risk. Non-O blood type is common in all races, making it an important risk factor. Individuals without O blood type have higher blood levels of von Willebrand factor and <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> than those with O blood type, increasing the likelihood of clotting.|$|E
5|$|The {{mortality}} rate from paracetamol overdose increases {{two days after}} the ingestion, reaches a maximum on day four, and then gradually decreases. Acidosis is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation. A {{mortality rate}} of 95% without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented pH less than 7.30. Other indicators of poor prognosis include renal insufficiency (stage3 or worse), hepatic encephalopathy, a markedly elevated prothrombin time, or an elevated blood lactic acid level (lactic acidosis). One study has shown that a factor V level less than 10% of normal indicated a poor prognosis (91% mortality), whereas a ratio of <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> to factor V of less than 30 indicated a good prognosis (100% survival). Patients with a poor prognosis are usually identified for likely liver transplantation. Patients that do not die are expected to fully recover and have a normal life expectancy and quality of life.|$|E
30|$|It is {{not clear}} how the {{administration}} of rFVIIa worked dramatically in reducing bleeding in this case. The high dose of FVIIa might have stimulated the coagulation cascade by the activation of factors IX and X in combination with <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and V through TF-dependent mechanism. Or the high dose of FVIIa might have stimulated the coagulation cascade, leading to subsequent thrombin generation through TF-independent mechanism. The latter mechanism seems more plausible because this pathway is enabled only when the high dose of FVIIa is provided and does not require the presence of <b>factors</b> V, <b>VIII,</b> and IX.|$|R
40|$|Carriers {{of severe}} and {{moderate}} haemophilia A and B {{are expected to}} have approximately 50 % of the normal level of <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and IX.

40|$|The {{effect on}} the {{coagulation}} mechanism of lactation suppressants was determined by comparing observations {{on a group of}} untreated women and two other groups, one receiving Vallestril (methallenestrill 20 mg) and the other Ortho-Novum 5 (5 mg norethindrone and 0. 075 mg mestranol).

Patients given Ortho-Novum 5 showed a continued significant elevation of levels of <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and IX {{for the duration of the}} study, and the partial thromboplastin time reflected this increase on days 4 and 10. Vallestril appeared to have the same effect on <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and IX, although to a lesser, nonsignificant degree. In addition, the day 10 levels of fibrinogen and factors VII and X, as well as platelet adhesiveness, of the untreated group were lower than those of the groups undergoing treatment, although the medication had been discontinued five days previously.

40|$|International audienceChronic {{allograft}} nephropathy (CAN), a {{major cause}} of late allograft failure, is characterized by a progressive decline in graft function correlated with tissue destruction. Uncontrolled activation of the coagulation cascade by the stressed endothelium of the graft is thought {{to play an important role}} in the pathophysiology of CAN. In this study, we demonstrate that circulating IgG from renal-transplanted patients are endowed with hydrolytic properties toward coagulation <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and IX, but fail to hydrolyze factor VII and prothrombin. The hydrolytic activity of IgG was reliably quantified by the measure of the hydrolysis of a fluorescent synthetic substrate for serine proteases: proline-phenylalanine-arginine-methylcoumarinamide (PFR-MCA). A retrospective case-control study indicated that an elevated hydrolysis rate of PFR-MCA by circulating IgG correlated with the absence of CAN lesions on protocol graft biopsy performed 2 years posttransplantation. We propose that circulating hydrolytic IgG may counterbalance the procoagulation state conferred by the activated endothelium by disrupting the amplification loop of thrombin generation which is dependent on <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and IX. Interestingly, low rates of PFR-MCA hydrolysis, measured 3 mo posttransplantation, were predictive of CAN at 2 years down the lane. These data suggest that PFR-MCA hydrolysis may be used as a prognosis marker for CAN in renal-transplanted patients...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{endothelial cell}} is {{considered}} antithrombogenic, endothelium {{has recently been}} shown to participate in procoagulant reactions. In this report cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells are shown to propagate a procoagulant pathway starting with factor XIa, leading to activation of <b>factors</b> IX, <b>VIII,</b> X, and prothrombin, culminating in fibrinopeptide A cleavage from fibrinogen and formation of a fibrin clot. Electron microscopic studies demonstrated that fibrin strands are {{closely associated with the}} endothelial cells. Endotoxin-treated endothelial cells, having acquired tissue factor activity, generated fibrinopeptide A in the presence of <b>factors</b> VIIa, IX, <b>VIII,</b> X, prothrombin, and fibrinogen. Factor X activation by factor VIIa and tissue factor expressed by endothelial cells is 10 times greater in the presence of <b>factors</b> IX and <b>VIII</b> than in their absence. This indicates that on the perturbed endothelial cell surface, <b>factors</b> IX and <b>VIII</b> do have {{an important role in the}} activation of factor X. Addition of platelets (10 (8) per ml) augmented thrombin formation seen in the presence of endothelium alone by about 15 -fold. Anti-human factor V IgG decreased this enhanced thrombin formation in the presence of platelets, indicating that factor V from platelets was playing an important role in thrombin formation. These data lead us to propose that endothelial cells can actively participate in procoagulant reactions. Although platelets can augment thrombin formation by these endothelial cell-dependent reactions, endothelial cells alone can lead to formation of a cell-associated fibrin clot. The endotoxin-treated endothelial cell provides a model of the thrombotic state supplying tissue factor to initiate coagulation and propagating the reactions leading to fibrin formation. This endothelial cell-dependent pathway suggests a central role for <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and IX consistent with their importance in hemostasis...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{review of}} the {{literature}} revealed limited information about the stability of samples for coagulation testing in dogs. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the stability of individual coagulation factors, clotting times, and other parameters of hemostasis; in stored canine plasma. Methods: Citrated plasma samples were obtained from 21 dogs. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen concentration, and factor I, II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII activities were measured on an automated coagulation analyzer with commercially available reagents. Antithrombin (AT) activity and D-dimer concentration were measured on an automated chemistry analyzer using validated kits. Samples were analyzed within 1 hour after collection (initial analysis) and once daily for 2 or 4 consecutive days following storage at room temperature (RT) or 4 degrees C, respectively. Results: Storage time at either temperature did not have any effect on PT, factor 11, V, VII, X, or XII activities, D-dimer concentration, or AT activity. In contrast, aPTT was significantly prolonged after 72 and 96 hours at 4 degrees C; fibrinogen concentration was decreased after 48 hours at RT; the activities of <b>factors</b> <b>VIII</b> and IX were decreased after 48, 72, and 96 hours at 4 degrees C; and factor XI activity was decreased after 72 hours at 4 degrees C.
