Modern methods of preservation include freezing, freeze-drying, and heat processing (as in canning). <b>Frozen</b> <b>fish</b> products include breaded or battered fillets, fish fingers and fishcakes. Fish meal {{is used as a}} food supplement for farmed fish and for livestock. Fish oils are made either from fish liver, especially rich in vitamins A and D, or from the bodies of oily fish such as sardine and herring, and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies.|$|E
5|$|The State of Israel faced {{enormous}} {{military and}} economic challenges in its early years, and the period from 1948 to 1958 {{was a time of}} food rationing and austerity, known as tzena. In this decade, over one million Jewish immigrants, mainly from Arab countries, but also including European Holocaust survivors, inundated the new state. They arrived when only basic foods were available and ethnic dishes had to be modified with a range of mock or simulated foods, such as chopped “liver” from eggplant, and turkey as a substitute for veal schnitzel for Ashkenazim, kubbeh made from <b>frozen</b> <b>fish</b> instead of ground meat for Iraqi Jews, and turkey in place of the lamb kebabs of the Mizrahi Jews. These adaptations remain as a legacy of that time.|$|E

Microbiological analysis includes the determination of total viable aerobic count by standard plate count method and enumeration of total coliforms and fecal coliforms by most probable number method. The presence of specific fish pathogens such as Salmonella spp. and Vibrio cholerae were also investigated. The TVAC of all the samples was estimated below 5 × 105 [*]cfu/g whereas the total coliforms and fecal coliforms count were found below 100 [*]MPN/g and 10 [*]MPN/g, respectively, which meet the acceptable limit specified by International Commission of Microbiological Specification for Food. The microbiological analysis of water and ice also complies with the specifications having TVAC< 20 [*]cfu/mL, and total coliforms and fecal coliforms count were below the limit detection of the MPN method.

The results are as follows: 1) In Kamaboko prepared under ordinary conditions, the SH content scarcely decreased at the "suwari" stage but decreased to a certain extent at the "josha" stage. 2) In Kamaboko prepared under reduced pressure, SH content scarcely decreased at the "josha" stage {{as well as at the}} "suwari" stage. The "ashi" of Kamaboko prepared under reduced pressure was higher than that of Kamaboko prepared under ordinary pressure. 3) In Kamaboko prepared from C-grade <b>frozen</b> brayed <b>fish</b> meat adding potassium bromate (KBrO 3), the SH content apparently decreased both at the "suwari" and "josha" stages. "Ashi" of the Kamaboko prepared by adding KBrO 3 was higher than that of Kamaboko without KBrO 3. 4) When iodoacetic acid (IA), iodoacetamide (IAA), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) or p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (PCMB) was added to the <b>frozen</b> brayed <b>fish</b> meat, the total activities of Ca 2 +-ATPase and ATP sensitivities of actomyosin in the meat increased considerably but not when IA was added. When IA or IAA was added, the "ashi" greatly decreased and ordinary Kamaboko could not be produced. With NEM or PCMB, the "ashi" also decreased but ordinary Kamaboko could be produced. 冷凍すり身を用いてかまぼこを試製し,かまぼこの破壊強度(C.

25|$|Cyprinids {{are highly}} {{important}} food fish; they are fished and farmed across Eurasia. In land-locked countries in particular, cyprinids {{are often the}} major species of fish eaten because they make the largest part of biomass in most water types except for fast-flowing rivers. In Eastern Europe, they are often prepared with traditional methods, such as drying and salting. The prevalence of inexpensive <b>frozen</b> <b>fish</b> products made this less important {{now than it was}} in earlier times. Nonetheless, in certain places, they remain popular for food, as well as recreational fishing, and have been deliberately stocked in ponds and lakes for centuries for this reason.|$|E

They went to bed at sundown or early evening in the spring and fall, and well before sundown in summer, but arose early, often at 3:00 or 4:00a.m. and regularly at 5:00 or 5:30. The time of rising depended on the sea tide and the time when tomcod or other fish would be running. The first meal of the day was eaten at this time and another about 11:00a.m., with snacks once or twice in between depending on the work schedule and the availability of food. The evening meal was usually at 4:30 or 5:00p.m. with additional snacks between the main meals. In winter the entire meal schedule was likely to be moved forward, with the first meal of the day being eaten at 10:00 or 10:30a.m. The most common food was dried or <b>frozen</b> <b>fish</b> dipped in seal oil. The evening or late afternoon meal, the hot meal of the day, frequently consisted of boiled fish or other boiled food and tea.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to search the {{evolution}} of the amino nitrogen (mg AN %) and nitrogen from aminoacids (g NAA %) in four fish species during 36 hours of slow thawing (at + 20 [...] + 22 °C) to see which species have a higher spoilage speed in this conditions. The biological material was represented by <b>frozen</b> <b>fishes</b> (Norwegian herring, mackerel and salmon, and Romanian trout) which were subjected to slow thawing at room temperature (+ 20 [...] + 22 °C), analyzing, at certain intervals, amino nitrogen (mg NA %), nitrogen from aminoacids (g NAA %) and pH values. The amino nitrogen was determined by the difference between the nitrogen content of volatile bases, and the nitrogen content of the ammonia and primary amines. The nitrogen from aminoacids was evaluated according to Sörensen method, based on blocking the amino group of the aminoacids with formaldehyde, forming methylene- derivatives with acid reaction which were determined titrimetrically, and the pH was determined with a digital pH-meter type Hanna. The evolution of nitrogen compounds in <b>frozen</b> <b>fishes</b> during 36 hours of thawing at + 20 [...] + 22 °C, has shown differences between these species. So, the amino nitrogen values have indicated: fresh fish at 3 hours of thawing, fish with relative freshness at 6 hours of thawing, with lower values (and close) in herring, mackerel and salmon, and much greater in trout; an altered state of all fishes after 9 hours of thawing. The evolution of nitrogen from aminoacids values during the thawing fish has highlighted the beginning of alteration: at 3 hours only in trout; at 6 hours in herring, salmon and trout, and after 9 hours in all examined fishes...|$|R
