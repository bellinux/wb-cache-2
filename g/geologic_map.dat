40|$|The first {{systematic}} lunar <b>geologic</b> <b>maps</b> {{were completed}} at 1 : 1 M scale for the lunar near side during the 1960 s using telescopic and Lunar Orbiter (LO) photographs [1 - 3]. The program under which these maps were completed established precedents for map base, scale, projection, and boundaries {{in order to}} avoid widely discrepant products. A variety of <b>geologic</b> <b>maps</b> were subsequently produced for various purposes, including 1 : 5 M scale global maps [4 - 9] and large scale maps of high scientific interest (including the Apollo landing sites) [10]. Since that time, lunar science has benefitted from an abundance of surface information, including high resolution images and diverse compositional data sets, which have yielded a host of topical planetary investigations. The existing suite of lunar <b>geologic</b> <b>maps</b> and topical studies provide exceptional context in which to unravel the geologic history of the Moon. However, there has been no systematic approach to lunar <b>geologic</b> <b>mapping</b> since the flight of post-Apollo scientific orbiters. <b>Geologic</b> <b>maps</b> provide a spatial and temporal framework wherein observations can be reliably benchmarked and compared. As such, a lack of a systematic mapping program means that modern (post- Apollo) data sets, their scientific ramifications, and the lunar scientists who investigate these data, are all marginalized in regard to <b>geologic</b> <b>mapping.</b> Marginalization weakens the overall understanding of the geologic evolution of the Moon and unnecessarily partitions lunar research. To bridge these deficiencies, we began a pilot <b>geologic</b> <b>mapping</b> project in 2005 as a means to assess the interest, relevance, and technical methods required for a renewed lunar <b>geologic</b> <b>mapping</b> program [11]. Herein, we provide a summary of the pilot <b>geologic</b> <b>mapping</b> project, which focused on the geologic materials and stratigraphic relationships within the Copernicus quadrangle (0 - 30 degN, 0 - 45 degW) ...|$|R

5|$|The <b>geologic</b> <b>map</b> of Georgia (a state {{within the}} United States) is a {{special-purpose}} map made to show geological features. Rock units or geologic strata are shown by colors or symbols to indicate {{where they are}} exposed at the surface. Structural features such as faults and shear zones are also shown. Since the first national geological map, in 1809, {{there have been numerous}} maps which included the geology of Georgia. The first Georgia specific <b>geologic</b> <b>map</b> was created in 1825. The most recent state-produced <b>geologic</b> <b>map</b> of Georgia, by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources is 1:500,000 scale, and was created in 1976 by the department's Georgia Geological Survey. It was generated from a base map produced by the United States Geological Survey. The state geologist and Director of the Geological Survey of Georgia was Sam M. Pickering, Jr. Since 1976, several geological maps of Georgia, featuring the state's five distinct geologic regions, have been produced by the federal government.|$|E
50|$|Since every <b>geologic</b> <b>mapping</b> project covers an {{area with}} unique lithologies and complexities, and every {{geologist}} has a unique style of mapping, no software is perfect for digital <b>geologic</b> <b>mapping</b> out of the box. The geologist can choose to either modify their mapping style to the available software, or modify the software to their mapping style, which may require extensive programming. As of 2009, available <b>geologic</b> <b>mapping</b> software requires some degree of customization for a given <b>geologic</b> <b>mapping</b> project. Some digital-mapping geologists/programmers have chosen to highly customize or extend ESRI's ArcGIS instead. At digital field data capture meetings such as at the British Geological Survey in 2002 http://www.bgs.ac.uk/science/dfdc/abstracts.html some organisations agreed to share development experiences, and some software systems are now available to download for free.|$|R

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the United States, Georgia geology has been included in maps produced for the entire country. The first geological map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure. In 1807, Maclure undertook the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. He traversed and mapped nearly every state in the Union. During the rigorous two-year period of his survey, he crossed and recrossed the Allegheny Mountains some 50 times. The results of his unaided endeavor were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map, together with the nation's first geological map, which were published in the Society's journal Transactions, This precedes William Smith's geological map of England by six years, although Smith's map was constructed using a different classification of rocks. Several reports used Maclure’s geological map to accompany their description of the geology of the U.S. (Beaujour, 1814 and Marcou, 1858). In 1816, within an elementary treatise of mineralogy and geology, Parker Cleaveland produced a geological map of the U.S. In 1843, Charles Moxon produced a small-scale <b>geologic</b> <b>map</b> of the U.S., where Ami Boué produced a geological structure map of the globe. In 1853, Marcou produced a geological map of the U.S. and the British provinces of North America. In 1856, Henry Darwin Rogers created a similar map of the geology of the U.S. and British North America. There was a short description of the <b>geologic</b> <b>map</b> of the U.S. by Charles Henry Hitchcock in 1872, which had small-scale geological maps included. Hitchcock and William P. Blake published a general <b>geologic</b> <b>map</b> of the U.S. in R.W. Raymond’s Statistics of mines and mining. In 1874, they published a geological map of the U.S. and territories in the U.S. Census 9th Statistical Atlas. Hitchcock and Blake published a summary of this map in the Geological Magazine in 1873. Gray’s geological map of the U.S. was published in the National Atlas special edition at a scale of about 1inch to 300 miles in 1876 and reprinted in 1886 by the American Institute of Mining Engineers. A geological map of the U.S. east of the Rocky Mountains was produced at the scale of 1inch to 105.5 miles by Frank H. Bradley. In the 1880s several geological maps of the U.S. were produced. William John McGee offered a detailed description for the U.S. Geological Survey in 1884. In 1887, Hitchcock produced a geological map of the U.S. and parts of Canada that was at the scale of 1inch to 200 miles, with a review of the various maps of the U.S. that accompanied the geological map of the U.S. In 1895, McGee and J.B. Tolbert produced a 1:15,000,000 scale map of the geology of the U.S.|$|E

5|$|In 1796, Georges Cuvier {{published}} his {{findings on the}} differences between living elephants and {{those found in the}} fossil record. His analysis identified mammoths and mastodons as distinct species, different from any living animal, and effectively ended a long-running debate over whether a species could become extinct. In 1788, James Hutton described gradual geological processes operating continuously over deep time. In the 1790s, William Smith began the process of ordering rock strata by examining fossils in the layers while he worked on his <b>geologic</b> <b>map</b> of England. Independently, in 1811, Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart published an influential study of the geologic history of the region around Paris, based on the stratigraphic succession of rock layers. These works helped establish the antiquity of the Earth. Cuvier advocated catastrophism to explain the patterns of extinction and faunal succession revealed by the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|Several {{volcanic}} {{features in}} the Mount Cayley field were illustrated by volcanologist Jack Souther in 1980, including Mount Cayley, Cauldron Dome, Slag Hill, Mount Fee, Ember Ridge and Ring Mountain, which was titled Crucible Dome at the time. This resulted {{in the creation of}} a <b>geologic</b> <b>map</b> that showed the regional terrain and locations of the volcanoes. The most detailed study of Mount Cayley took place during this period. Little Ring Mountain at the northernmost end of the field had not been studied at the time and was not included on Souther's 1980 map. Ember Ridge at the southern end of the field was originally mapped as a cluster of five lava domes. The sixth lava dome, Ember Ridge Northeast, was discovered by Ph.D. student Melanie Kelman during a period of research in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The map of Georgia is {{actually}} a compilation of numerous geological studies and mapping projects that occurred throughout the state and over an extended time period. The major studies that are cited for contribution to the state <b>geologic</b> <b>map</b> fall under three main categories: New mapping by the Georgia Geological Survey, new mapping by the Georgia Geological Survey combined with revised published maps, and published maps with compilation revision only. The majority of the rock units shown on the 1976 map were mapped in 1973 by reconnaissance methods. For some areas, previous authors provided more detailed work than the reconnaissance conducted by the geological survey staff. In those areas, the original author’s work was used in compiling the state map.|$|E
