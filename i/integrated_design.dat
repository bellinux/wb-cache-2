5|$|The UERL {{became part}} of London Transport in 1933, but the focus {{remained}} on high quality design. Under Pick, Holden's attention to detail and idea of <b>integrated</b> <b>design</b> extended to all parts of London's transport network, from designing bus and tram shelters to {{a new type of}} six-wheeled omnibus. In the late 1930s, Holden designed replacement stations at Highgate, East Finchley and Finchley Central and new stations at Elstree South and Bushey Heath for the Northern line's Northern Heights plan. Holden's designs incorporated sculpture relevant to the local history of a number of stations: Dick Whittington for Highgate, a Roman centurion at Elstree South and an archer for East Finchley. Much of the project was postponed shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War and was later cancelled. Only East Finchley station was completed in full with Highgate in part; the other plans were scrapped. East Finchley station is located on an embankment and the platforms are accessed from below. Making use of the station's air-rights, Holden provided staff office space spanning above the tracks accessed through semi-circular glazed stairways from the platforms. Eric Aumonier provided the statue The Archer, a prominent feature of the station.|$|E

Background: The definition of service design is not clear yet, also did not define in this study. I studied the components of service design which are roles and human resources.

Results: The roles of service design are service strategy, research, service concept design, service specification, service architecture <b>design,</b> <b>integrated</b> communication <b>design,</b> <b>integrated</b> system <b>design,</b> <b>integrated</b> operation <b>design,</b> service evaluation, launch, operation, and knowledge management.

25|$|The {{courtyard}} doughnut {{shape is}} critical to the two main design priorities: daylighting and natural ventilation. Natural daylighting was achieved through the shallow floor plate depths and high ceilings allowing for light to penetrate the interior of the offices from both the exterior of the building and the core open-air courtyard. Daylighting models were tested at the University of Washington’s <b>Integrated</b> <b>Design</b> Lab to ensure even lighting and minimizing glare to users working on computers. Within the bulk of the building, daylight sensors are on all lighting within 15 feet of the windows and Energy Star equipment is provided to reduce the plug load.|$|E

In February 1972, the approval to proceed with full development was issued. In May 1972, the first project meeting was held in Bordeaux, at which the order for the four prototypes was formally placed. By November 1972, the project had passed its first mock-up review. Dassault was designated as the 'pilot' company for the project and possessed final authority on design and management decisions, this approach to project management has been claimed to have been a mostly efficient manner of running the program.|$|E

500|$|The designs Pick {{commissioned}} from Holden (1931–33) {{established a}} new standard for the Underground, with the prototype station at Sudbury Town being described by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner as a [...] "landmark" [...] {{and the start of}} [...] "the 'classic' phase of Underground architecture". To ensure that the new stations achieved the complete and coherent design that he wanted, Pick instructed the engineering departments to provide Holden with full details of all equipment needed for the stations. After late equipment changes by the engineers at the first few new stations compromised the <b>integrated</b> <b>design,</b> Pick took personal charge of the coordination of the architectural and engineering elements. In the mid-1930s when the introduction of trolleybuses to replace trams required the installation of new street poles to support overhead wiring, Pick was keenly interested that the design of the poles was coordinated to accommodate all of the possible equipment and signage that might be needed. He also oversaw the designs of the new bus stops and bus shelters that were installed when specified stopping points were introduced for bus services.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{this sense}} of the {{building}} being sculptured, unified and [...] "pulled together" [...] by the encircling band of the deep cornice that led Eneide Mignacca {{to conclude that the}} ovoid profile, seen now in the end product, was an essential part of Michelangelo's first (and last) concept. The sculptor/architect has, figuratively speaking, taken all the previous designs in hand and compressed their contours as if the building were a lump of clay. The dome must appear to thrust upwards because of the apparent pressure created by flattening the building's angles and restraining its projections. If this explanation is the correct one, then the profile of the dome is not merely a structural solution, as perceived by Giacomo della Porta; {{it is part of the}} <b>integrated</b> <b>design</b> solution that is about visual tension and compression. In one sense, Michelangelo's dome may appear to look backward to the Gothic profile of Florence Cathedral and ignore the Classicism of the Renaissance, but on the other hand, perhaps more than any other building of the 16th century, it prefigures the architecture of the Baroque.|$|E
