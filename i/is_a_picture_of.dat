25|$|The {{previous}} {{series of}} Royal Bank of Scotland notes, originally issued in 1987, remains in circulation, {{although it is}} {{now in the process of}} being replaced by polymer notes. On the front of each note <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Lord Ilay (1682–1761), the first governor of the bank, based on a portrait painted in 1744 by the Edinburgh artist Allan Ramsay.

500|$|As {{with their}} {{previous}} albums, the album cover {{was designed by}} Martyn Atkins and the photography was by Brian Griffin. With the band wanting to continue the elemental theme of the previous three albums, the photograph used on the front cover of the album <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the band in a rowing boat which was taken inside Carnglaze Caverns, Liskeard, Cornwall. In his 2002 book Turquoise Days: The Weird World of Echo & the Bunnymen, author Chris Adams describes the cover as [...] "a perfect visual representation of arguably the Bunnymen's finest album".|$|E
500|$|The {{cover of}} the album <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Marina City in the band's adopted {{hometown}} of Chicago.

500|$|The {{back cover}} of the album {{features}} {{a photograph of a}} rubber monkey in front of a collage created by Cobain. The collage features photos of raw beef from a supermarket advertisement, images from Dante's Inferno, and pictures of diseased vaginas from Cobain's collection of medical photos. Cobain noted, [...] "If you look real close, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Kiss in the back standing on a slab of beef." [...] The album's liner notes contain no complete song lyrics; instead, the liner contains random song lyrics and unused lyrical fragments that Cobain arranged into a poem. However, the single for [...] "Lithium" [...] contains lyrics for each song in Nevermind.|$|E

500|$|Many musical artists, {{including}} Madonna, Lady Gaga, Eminem, Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, and Adele have publicly {{made the}} gesture.

M.I.A. gave the gesture during the Super Bowl XLVI Halftime Show. The National Football League, NBC, and M.I.A. apologized. The CD itself for Kid Rock's album Devil Without a Cause <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> his raised middle finger.

[...] The finger was airbrushed out of subsequent releases of the album.|$|E
500|$|The Ice King is {{oblivious}} {{to his former}} self, and Marceline begins looking through the Ice King's scrapbook pages to show him evidence of his former life. Among the pages <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a young Marceline, with a message to her from {{a thousand years ago}} scrawled on the back. The message, written by Simon before his mind was completely consumed by the magic of the crown, asks Marceline to forgive him for whatever he does under the crown's influence. The Ice King fails to understand the context, and believes that he has written not a note of apology but lyrics, and attempts to add music to his [...] "song". Overcome by emotion, Marceline cries and begins singing along while the Ice King plays drums, oblivious as to what is actually going on.|$|E
500|$|The {{photographs}} in the original cassette release of Buddha were photographs taken by friend of the band Cam Jones. Kerry Key, drummer for the Iconoclasts and friend of the band, also is credited with artwork in the original cassette. To produce the artwork, Hoppus and Jones spent an afternoon together taking [...] "artsy" [...] {{photographs in}} and around Raynor's backyard. The cover art <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a Buddha statue, which was a present from Hoppus' stepfather that the bassist grabbed {{on the way to}} Raynor's for the photos. After developing the photos, they took them to a copy shop to run off color copies. Afterwards, they cut, pasted and rearranged them until they found something suitable. The lyric sheets were handwritten and photocopied. Hoppus and his family in Ridgecrest would spend hours folding and combining pieces of artwork to compile the Buddha cassette. When this was complete, Hoppus would load the cassettes into his car and deliver them to local record stores around town.|$|E
