500|$|Minaj {{is known}} for her {{animated}} rapping style, her flow in particular. She often combines metaphors, punch lines and word play into her work, which {{has been compared to}} her mentor Lil Wayne. The New York Times called Minaj [...] "a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid <b>evolver,</b> discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones." [...] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: [...] "What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was a time}} of {{problems}} and conflicts for Megadeth, that in every two weeks or so, according to frontman Dave Mustaine, there were [...] "outrageous emotional interventions" [...] {{in order to make the}} group a democracy. Many band meetings during this period concerned Mustaine's creative control over a [...] "successful formula", so that the rest of the band could better exercise their creativity. Another problem was the indecision on where the recording would take place. Mustaine did not want to record in Los Angeles, so it was eventually decided to record in Phoenix, since the majority of the band resided in Arizona. The sessions for the album initially began in Phase Four Studios (Tempe) in January 1994, after a few weeks the sessions were moved to Vintage Recorders in Phoenix and continued there into May- this studio is often the location for scenes in the <b>Evolver</b> video.|$|E

40|$|Phagotrophy was (and is!) {{a crucial}} {{element in the}} {{evolution}} of photosynthetic eucaryotes. The photosynthetic function in all eucaryotes can be traced to one or more endosymbiotic events involving the ingestion and retention of (unicellular) photosynthetic organisms. In some cases (chloroplasts of green and red algae) this loss of autonomy of the ingested procaryote occurs by transfer of many genes essential for functioning as a plastid to the host nucleus and the loss of many others. At {{the other end of the}} time scale is the temporary (for a month or two) retention of functioning chloroplasts from food items by ascoglossan (sacoglossan) gastropods. The universal involvement of phagotrophy {{in the evolution of}} photosynthetic eucaryotes means that phagotrophy is considered a primitive character and its absence a derived character in these organisms. Starting from an elaboration of these basic phenomena, I consider two questions.

40|$|The marine {{environment}} {{is an important}} habitat where many processes occur that affect life conditions on earth. Macrophytes and planktonic oxygen <b>evolvers</b> are an essential component for almost all marine life forms and have developed {{in an environment that}} differs largely from the terrestrial habitats. For instance in regards to available ionic forms of inorganic carbon and moving water masses which affects incoming light. It is therefore relevant to examine the physiology of algae and marine plants to identify their unique features and differences to terrestrial plants that once orginated from algae. By using chlorophyll fluorescence measurements alone or combined with measurements of oxygen evolution and protein analysis photosynthetic strategies to withstand excess energy have been evaluated under a variety of experimental conditions. Furthermore metabolic pathways involved in energy transfer from photosynthesis to the site of active carbon uptake have been examined. The following was found: * The ratio between photosynthetic gross oxygen evolution and estimated electron transport rate varies in Ulva spp depending on previous history of light and dark exposures. To obtain P/I curves with ratios close to the theoretical 1 : 4 value, measurements should be performed on separate pieces of tissue at each irradiance level. * Under carbon deficient conditions, the estimated ETR is larger than the gross oxygen evolution, which {{may be due to the}} so called “water-water” cycle and absorption changes in PSII which are not corrected for in the calculation of ETR. * Upon exposure to high irradiances (1500 µmol photons m- 2 s- 1) the PSII core protein D 1 is broken down with a concomittant reduction in ETR in Ulva spp. With the decrease in electron transport between PSII and PSI the acidification of the lumen decreases and the ability to dissipate excess energy as heat. At prolonged irradiance, an acclimation occurs with a lesser or no breakdown of D 1 indicating an additional photo-protective strategy other than heat dissipation. * Laminaria saccharina is dependent on mitochondrial respiration for active utilization of bicarbonate. By extruding protons outside the plasmalemma an acidification takes place that favors the conversion of bicarbonate into carbon dioxide that then can diffuse in to the cell. These proton pumps are driven by ATP supplied to a large degree from mitochondria, likely through the reductant NADPH produced photochemically. * The marine angiosperm Zostera marina is dependent on mitochondrial respiration for utilization of bicarbonate in a manner similar to that in Laminaria saccharina. However, the water-water cycle may supply additional ATP to the proton pumps in Zostera marina. Both species exhibit a lag-phase at the onset of illumination after a dark incubation period and at least part of this lag-phase is due to a lag in an activation of mitochondrial supported bicarbonate utilization. It is clear that the {{marine environment}} holds complex plant and algae species and much is still to discover about the oxygen <b>evolvers</b> that grow beneath the water surface...|$|R
60|$|Now, compare a plant, thus contemplated, with an animal. In the former, the {{productive}} energy exhausts itself, {{and as it}} were, sleeps in the product or 'organismus'--in its root, stem, foliage, blossoms, seed. Its balsams, gums, resins, 'aromata', and all other bases of its sensible qualities, are, it is well known, mere excretions from the vegetable, eliminated, as lifeless, from the actual plant. The qualities are not its properties, but the properties, or far rather, the dispersion and volatilization of these extruded and rejected bases. But in the animal it is otherwise. Here the antecedent unity--{{the productive}} and self-realizing idea--strives, with partial success to re-emancipate itself from its product, and seeks once again to become 'idea': vainly indeed: for in order to this, it must be retrogressive, and it hath subjected itself to the fates, the <b>evolvers</b> of the endless thread--to the stern necessity of progression. 'Idea' itself it cannot become, but it may in long and graduated process, become an image, an ANALOGON, an anti-type of IDEA. And this [Greek: eidolon] may approximate to a perfect likeness. 'Quod est simile, nequit esse idem'. Thus, in the lower animals, we see this process of emancipation commence with the intermediate link, or that which forms the transition from properties to faculties, namely, with sensation. Then the faculties of sense, locomotion, construction, as, for instance, webs, hives, nests, &c. Then the functions; as of instinct, memory, fancy, instinctive intelligence, or understanding, as it exists in the most intelligent animals. Thus the idea (henceforward no more idea, but irrecoverable by its own fatal act) commences the process of its own transmutation, as 'substans in substantiato', as the 'enteleche', or the 'vis formatrix', and it finishes the process as 'substans e substantiato', that is, as the understanding.|$|R
