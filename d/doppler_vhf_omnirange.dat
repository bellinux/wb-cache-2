The radar has three operation modes; spectrum mode, double-pulse mode and meteor mode. The spectrum mode provides doppler spectra of back-scattered signals from which characteristics of the plasma turbulence due to auroral activity can be investigated.

40|$|A {{technique}} to deduce the virtual temperature from the combined {{use of the}} equations of fluid dynamics, observed wind and observed radiances is described.

The proposed technique is an extension of the Gal-Chen technique. It is assumed that due to modeling uncertainties the equations of fluid dynamics are satisfied only in the least square sense. The retrieved temperature, however, is constrained to reproduce the observed radiances.

These fronts are also evident in the radar reflectivity data. Most studies of the vertical circulation patterns associated with mososcale systems have used precipitation and cloud formations as tracers.

40|$|Purposes of this {{research}} are to observe and analyze the vertical profile of the rain drop size distribution (DSD), and to utilize the results into formulating a new method of estimating rainfall intensity and/or amount by making use of information detected by operational radar observations. Firstly, observations of DSD were carried out both by the Disdrometer in conjunction with an optical instrument on ground surface, and also by a vertical pointing <b>VHF</b> <b>Doppler</b> radar in Japan named the MU (Middle and Upper) Radar, which can detect vertical profiles of the Doppler spectrum that are composed of both the rain drop itself and air movements.

Finally, the foymulation was applied into two case studies. One was to a operational volume scanning radar, in which we can directly use information from the vertical profiles of DSD observed by the MU Rader, thereby checking the feasibility of the formulation, (although we can not currently use the information on the spectrum width in the operational sense).

40|$|SUMMARY In {{order to}} assess the {{possible}} impacts of meteors with spacecraft, which is among major hazard in the space environment, {{it is essential to}} establish an accurate statistics of their mass and velocity. We developed a radar-optical combined system for detecting faint meteors con-sisting of a powerful <b>VHF</b> <b>Doppler</b> radar and an ICCD video camera. The Doppler pulse compression scheme is used to enhance the S/N ratio of the radar echoes with very large Doppler shifts, as well as to determine their range with a resolution of 200 m. A very high sensitivity of more than 14 magnitude and 9 magnitude for radar and optical sensors, respectively, has been obtained. Instantaneous direction of meteor body observed by the radar is determined with the interferometry technique. We examined the optimum way of the receiving antenna arrangements, and also of the signal processing. Its absolute accuracy was confirmed by the optical observations with background stars as a reference. By combining the impinging velocity of meteor bodies derived by the radar with the absolute visual magnitude de-termined by the video camera simultaneously, the mass of each meteor body was estimated. The developed observation system will be used to create a valuable data base of the mass and velocity information of faint meteors, on which very little is known so far.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the studies of}} aurora using three observation instruments; the SAPPHIRE SOUTH VHF radar system, the ASC (All-Sky Camera) system at Rabbit Lake, Saskatchewan, and the 50 -MHz CW (Continuous Wave) bistatic Doppler radars in the 1981 campaign. The SAPPHIRE SOUTH radar system, which has a high temporal and frequency resolution, is a multi-beam CW bistatic <b>VHF</b> <b>Doppler</b> radar system. Two transmitters, located at La Crete (Alberta), and Gillam (Manitoba), transmitted on four transmitter beams for each transmitter and intersected with four receiver beams from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan to form 32 radar target regions in the lower E-region of the ionosphere. The ASC system at Rabbit Lake provides digitized high resolution optical auroral images at several wavelengths (557. 7 nm, 630. 0 nm) and for the whole visible spectrum. The observing region of the ASC system covered all the radar target regions of the SAPPHIRE SOUTH radar system. The 50 MHz CW bistatic Doppler radars in the 1981 campaign had a special radar setup with three transmitters and two receivers to provide multiple radar beams with different aspect and flow angles. The AE index and Kp index data have been compared with the radar Doppler spectral characteristics extracted by using software designed for peak-finding and curve-fitting. The radar data received by the SAPPHIRE SOUTH radar system have been compared with the optical data obtained by the ASC: system in Rabbit Lake. The results showed that strong Type 1 and Type 3 radar auroral echoes were received along the auroral arc alignment while weak Type 2 echoes were observed in the direction perpendicular to the auroral arc alignment. The power of radar auroral echoes received along the auroral arc alignment was well correlated with the standard deviation of the optical auroral emission inside the radar target region. The non-linear theory of the Type 3 radar auroral echoes has also been examined. A fading analysis {{has been applied to}} the SAPPHIRE SOUTH radar data to examine whether the electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) wave caused the fading of VHF radar auroral signals. The results showed that fading frequency ranges of Type 3 and Type 4 echoes were consistent with electric field oscillation and primary particle modulation arising from EMIC waves. The results of statistical studies on the data obtained from the radars in the 1981 campaign showed that the power of radar auroral backscatter echoes received by the radar link with a large aspect angle (4. 08 °) and a small assumed flow angle (6. 17 °) correlated well with the AE index. Regardless of the AE index, strong radar auroral backscatter echoes were observed by the radar link with smallest aspect angle (1. 57 °). Type 1 and Type 5 radar auroral backscatter mostly occurred for large values of the AE index, while Type 2 and Type 3 radar auroral backscatter echoes were mostly observed for small values of the AE index...|$|R
40|$|Weather radar {{capabilities}} {{have improved}} {{dramatically over the}} last 50 years. Following World War II, surplus military radars were turned {{to the study of}} weather. Since then, they have evolved to the modern standard of rainfall estimations available to the general public in real time. Forecasters rely on weather radars not only for routine forecasting, but also for tracking rapidly evolving, potentially hazardous, severe weather events. These storms have the potential to cause flash floods and hence loss of crops, livestock, and human life. Most weather radars estimate rainfall by converting the measured reflectivity to a rainrate via an empirical relationship (Z-R relationship). There are limitations in the accuracy of the rainfall estimates derived from these scanning radars. Variations in the raindrop size distribution (DSD), that is, the spread of sizes of raindrops falling at a given location, affect the measured reflectivity, and thus the rain rate estimate. The DSD can vary both temporally and spatially, and also with latitude. Investigation of the DSD and its evolution can be used to investigate the effectiveness of Z-R relationships in varied meteorological conditions and locations. Well-established techniques exist for retrieving the DSD using vertically pointing <b>VHF</b> <b>Doppler</b> radars. These radars can simultaneously detect a clear-air echo due to fluctuations in temperature and humidity, and a precipitation echo. Mean vertical air motion and spectral width are estimated from the clear air spectrum, and used to correct the precipitation spectrum through a deconvolution procedure. The corrected precipitation spectrum is then converted to a size spectrum, and the DSD calculated. The DSD and associated integral parameters such as rainrate and liquid water content can then be used to infer the microphysical processes dominating the cloud and precipitation structure. This knowledge can then be used to investigate various Z-R relationships. This thesis presents DSD retrievals from VHF profilers located in Adelaide and Darwin. Each profiler is installed within the footprint of a scanning weather radar, allowing direct comparison of the same air space. These radars provide a unique opportunity to study the evolution of the DSD with the profiler, and use this to investigate variations in time and height of the Z-R relationship. The locations of the radars also permits investigation of the differing nature of DSD evolution in the tropics compared to the mid-latitudes. The TWP-ICE field campaign was conducted in Darwin and surrounding areas in January and February 2006. The campaign involved many instruments, both insitu and remote sensing, including a fleet of aircraft and ship. The University of Adelaide Atmospheric Physics Group installed a VHF wind profiler operating at 54. 1 MHz near Darwin airport for the experiment. This radar sampled the same air space as a C-band polarimetric scanning radar (CPol), which performed horizontal scans at increasing elevations, along with vertical scans over the profiler site every 10 minutes. Results from 8 events, differing in age, type, dominant microphysical process and seasonal regime are presented in this thesis. A VHF profiler permanently located near Adelaide airport provides an observational capability similar to Darwin, but in the mid-latitudes where the processes dictating rainfall are vastly different. This radar also operates at 54. 1 MHz, and is installed within the footprint of an operational weather watch radar. Pseudo vertical scans can be constructed from the successive horizontal scans allowing direct comparisons. This profiler is the first generation of the profiler in Darwin. It is not as powerful and cannot detect low intensity rainfall. Due to this and the drought South Australia experienced between 2006 and 2008, data from Adelaide are limited. Two events are presented. Seasonal trends in the tropics, that is break conditions as opposed to the monsoon, are compared and contrasted. These trends are then compared to the limited Adelaide data. By analysing the evolution in both time and height of the DSD, and the dependence on season and latitudinal location, this thesis leads {{to a better understanding of}} the microphysical processes dictating rainfall in the tropics and mid-latitudes.
