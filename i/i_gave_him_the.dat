25|$|In {{the early}} 1420s James acted as {{the link between}} his brother and the {{powerful}} Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany who was acting as Regent for his cousin James I of Scotland while he was being held by the English for ransom. His links with the Albany Stewarts however did not prevent him from becoming a councillor to the king once he returned from imprisonment in 1424. Along with his nephew, Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Douglas, {{he sat on the}} jury which convicted Murdoch and two of his sons of treason for failure to pay the ransom and allowing the king to be imprisoned for 18 years. In 1426 as a reward for his loyalty Douglas received royal confirmation of his lands, his eldest son William was knighted in 1430 and by 1435 he was sheriff of Lanarkshire strengthening his place among the kings principal followers. This backing from the earl of Douglas' senior kinsman was vital for the king to prevent a clash with the powerful Douglas affinity and shortly before his death in 1437 James <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> title of Earl of Avondale.|$|E

During the interview, published on September 24, Dannemann stated: [...] "I loved him, and Jimi loved me... We were already engaged... I would then have designed the sleeves for his records...

[...] On September 20, a reporter from The Daily Telegraph interviewed Dannemann's brother, Klaus-Peter Dannemann, who stated: [...] " [...] telephoned me on [...] {{and told me that}} [...] took nine sleeping tablets. She said that Jimi had told her that he wanted to sleep for {{a day and a half}} before he went to America. She told me that he did not intend to kill himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Lewis Merenstein had a {{background}} in jazz, and according to Merenstein, Morrison [...] "was not an aficionado of jazz when I met him. R and soul, yes; but jazz, no. For the Astral Weeks recording sessions, Merenstein first contacted veteran bassist Richard Davis. Perhaps {{best known for his}} work with Eric Dolphy, Davis essentially served as the session leader, and it was through Davis that Merenstein recruited guitarist Jay Berliner, percussionist Warren Smith, Jr., and drummer Connie Kay. All of these musicians had strong backgrounds in jazz; Berliner had worked closely with Charles Mingus and Kay was part of the Modern Jazz Quartet. Morrison was still working with Kielbania and Payne, but for these sessions, they were essentially replaced. According to Kielbania, [...] "I got to show all the bass lines to Richard Davis. He embellished a lot of them, but <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> feeling." ...|$|E

2500|$|His last public {{statement}} was dictated {{to his daughter}} Helen in reply to receiving the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford's [...] "sorrow and affection": [...] "There is no expression of Christian sympathy that I value more {{than that of the}} ancient University of Oxford, the God-fearing and God-sustaining University of Oxford. I served her perhaps mistakenly, but {{to the best of my}} ability. [...] My most earnest prayers are hers to the uttermost and to the last". He left the house for the last time on 9 April. After 18 April he did not come down to the ground floor but still came out of bed to lie on the sofa. [...] The Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane George Wilkinson recorded when he ministered to him along with Stephen Gladstone: Shall I ever forget the last Friday in Passion Week, when <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> last Holy Communion that I was allowed to administer to him? It was early in the morning. He was obliged to be in bed, and he was ordered to remain there, but the time had come for the confession of sin and the receiving of absolution. Out of his bed he came. Alone he knelt in the presence of his God till the absolution has been spoken, and the sacred elements received.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> {{means of}} {{arranging}} his ideas; {{that is to}} say, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> match-box. He blew some preliminary clouds of smoke and then he answered me: ...|$|E
60|$|My {{right hand}} {{was in my}} mother's left, so <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> other.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>'im</b> <b>the</b> tanner. It {{was no use}} {{standing}} there arguing over a tanner, with a purse of twelve quid waiting {{for me in the}} dock, but I told 'im wot people thought of 'im.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wet outside, wet your inside," [...] muttered Joe sulkily, [...] "'as {{always been}} my motto. Sorry <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>'im</b> <b>the</b> honey. Who'd ha' thought {{the product of an}} 'armless insect could 'a done 'im in like this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{looked up}} {{just in time}} to see Joe’s ’ead disappear. Then I nipped up, and arter I ’ad told ’im part of wot I thought about <b>’im</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>’im</b> <b>the</b> letter and told ’im to sheer off.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> letter, for I {{could not}} speak, and with {{difficulty}} he deciphered it.|$|E
60|$|I laughed again, {{and raising}} my arm <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> nozzle of a pistol to contemplate.|$|E
60|$|I chained Orso to a post of the fence, and, {{removing}} his muzzle, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> old rubber shoe.|$|E

6000|$|... "Lemme go inside," [...] said Marvel, {{staggering}} and weeping, {{but still}} clutching the books. [...] "Lemme go inside. Lock me in--somewhere. I tell you he's after me. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> slip. He said he'd kill {{me and he}} will." ...|$|R
60|$|A. What, my deceived Farcillo, that <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> ring, {{in which}} all my {{affections}} were concentrated? Oh, surely not.|$|E
60|$|My heart leaped with gladness, for I {{knew what}} he had in mind, and <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> bearings—west-north-west, and five hundred miles away.|$|E
60|$|I'm {{bound to}} say I rather liked his manner. Absolutely normal. Not {{a trace of}} the fellow-conspirator about it. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> {{afternoon}} off.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can't help it,' she said, smiling. 'Every moment comes {{some fresh}} {{kindness}} from <b>him.</b> <b>The</b> more trouble <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> kinder he is.

6000|$|... "But he isn't here. You see, {{directly}} I {{found that}} he was a sock-sneaker <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> boot. That's why I went to London--to get a new man." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's young Abram Parsons, I tell 'ee, as {{lies down}} there," [...] cried the old creature, wildly. [...] "I ought to know. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> pair o' these forty year ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be useless, sir, {{to ask him}} {{any more}} {{questions}} to-night," [...] she said. [...] "He has been weak and nervous all day, and he is worn out by the effort he has made.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> all <b>the</b> {{knowledge}} <b>I</b> possessed. Then Mr. Ranson called Phil {{aside and}} had a long talk with him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps not, Sergeant, perhaps not; nor any better. This Jasper behaved well, too, when <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> {{command of}} the Scud; no lad could have {{conducted}} himself more loyally or better." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked very}} sad at this, so I {{said that he}} must some of them, at all events. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> same time as before for reduction.|$|E
60|$|With that <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> cold steel for all I was worth. His body kicked {{under me}} like a spring sofa; he gave a dreadful kind of a long moan, and lay still.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well,--yes, the Bishop. The Bishop {{has told}} the Doctor to examine me, and the Doctor has done it. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> credit of saying that the task has been most distasteful to him. I do <b>him</b> <b>the</b> justice of {{acknowledging}} that he has {{backed out of the}} work he had undertaken.
