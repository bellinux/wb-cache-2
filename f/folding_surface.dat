40|$|Crystalline {{structure}} of biopolymers {{is shown to}} be greatly affected by the environment. The ubiquitous presence of moisture is found to disturb the crystalline {{structure of}} a biosynthesized model polypeptide. We propose a step-by-step mechanism to describe the process of hydration-induced structural changes. On the other hand, {{in the study of}} silk fibroin crystallization behavior, it is found that the presence of an oriented substrate can enhance the crystallization of silk II structure even from a dilute aqueous solution with or without salt. The mechanism of substrate-induced crystallization is discussed. ^ The model polypeptide used in the hydration study has a lamellar structure with uniform lamellar thickness, a <b>folding</b> <b>surface</b> decorated with functional groups and a crystalline core with β-sheet chain conformation. Its structure is changed by moisture sorption in a sequential way. The <b>folding</b> <b>surface</b> functionality is hydrated most quickly followed by the expansion of crystalline core in the intersheet distance. The crystalline chain conformation is the last to be changed. The expansion is proposed to be due to unfavorable surface energetics induced by the incorporation of water molecules on the <b>folding</b> <b>surface.</b> Comparison of hydration-induced structural changes between two polypeptides with different lamellar thickness supports this explanation. The change in chain conformation is ascribed to the direct interaction of water and peptide units. ^ Silk fibroin known to be unable to crystallize from dilute aqueous solution with or without salt is found to crystallize in the silk II form on the poly(tetrafluoroethylene) oriented substrate. The orientation and chain conformation of silk fibroin crystals thus formed are characterized with external reflection infrared spectroscopy. Both lattice matching and surface topography are possible nucleation mechanisms. ^ The same oriented substrate is used in the study of crystallization of nylons from formic acid solution induced by nonsolvents. Different nonsolvents are found to induce different degree of orientation in the nylon crystals. Nylon 6 and nylon 66 exhibit different molecular arrangements on the oriented substrate. This difference in molecular arrangement is supposed to be due to the different phase separation behavior between these two polymers. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Analysis of {{cortical}} folding {{may provide}} insight into neurodevelopment deviations, which, in turn, can predispose to depression that responds particularly poorly to medications. We hypothesized that patients with treatment-resistant depression would exhibit measurable alterations in cortical folding. METHODS: We computed hemispheric global sulcal indices (g-SIs) in T(1) -weighted magnetic resonance images obtained from 76 patients and 70 healthy controls. We separately searched for anatomic deviations in patients with bipolar disorder (16 patients with treatment-resistant depression, 25 with euthymia) and unipolar depression (35 patients with treatment-resistant depression). RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, both groups of patients with treatment-resistant depression exhibited reduced g-SIs: in the right hemisphere among patients with bipolar disorder and in both hemispheres among those with unipolar depression. Patients with euthymic bipolar disorder {{did not differ significantly}} from depressed patients or healthy controls. Among patients with bipolar disorder who were taking lithium, we found positive correlations between current lithium dose and g-SIs in both hemispheres. LIMITATIONS: We cannot estimate {{the extent to which the}} observed g-SI reductions are linked to treatment resistance and to what extent they are state-dependent. Furthermore, we cannot disentangle the impact of medications from that of the affective disorder. Finally, there is interindividual variation and overlap of g-SIs among patients and healthy controls that need to be considered when interpreting our results. CONCLUSION: Reduced global cortical <b>folding</b> <b>surface</b> appears to be characteristic of patients with treatment-resistant depression, either unipolar or bipolar. In patients with bipolar disorder, treatment with lithium may modify cortical <b>folding</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|E
40|$|Langevin {{molecular}} dynamics (LMD) simulations {{have been performed}} to understand {{the role of the}} short chain branches (SCB) on the formation of ordered domains by cooling dilute solutions of ethylene/α-olefins copolymer models. Three different long single-chain models (C 2000) with 0, 5, and 10 branches each 1000 carbons were selected. These models were equilibrated at high reduced temperature (T* = 13. 3) and cooling in steps of 0. 45 until the final temperature (T* = 6. 2) by running a total of 35 × 106 LMD steps. During the cooling process, global order parameter, torsion distribution, position of the branches, and local-bond order parameter were calculated and monitored. The peaks of crystallization for each model were calculated by differentiating the global order parameter with temperature. The Tc (crystallization temperature) decreases as the number of branches increases as has been experimentally reported. The formation of order in the copolymers is affected by the amount of the SCB in the backbone of the polymer chain. Initially, the SCB move to the <b>folding</b> <b>surface.</b> Once the SCB are located near the <b>folding</b> <b>surface</b> the order starts to grow. In all cases here shown, the C 4 branches are excluded from the ordered domains. To take into account, the influence of the branch distribution, a different branch distribution model has been considered for the two-branched systems. The crystallization fraction (α) and the density of the amorphous and ordered fractions was defined using the local-bond order parameter. Both magnitudes decrease as the number of branches increases. These facts fairly agree with experimental literature data. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Thanks are due to the MICINN (MAT 2009 - 12364 project) for financial support. J.

Poly(bisphenol A-etheralkane) (Cn) contains both rigid aromatic and flexible aliphatic CH 2 segments. The number of CH 2 units per flexible segment, n, varies from 8 to 12. Principal component analysis (PCA) of TOF-SIMS data revealed the chemical and structural variations of the <b>folding</b> <b>surfaces</b> of these polymers and identified the ion peaks contributing to these variations. We highlighted the discriminating power of PCA to distinguish the structural conformations of the amorphous and flat-on lamellar surfaces of these polymers. PCA loadings analyses showed that relatively more flexible structures were deposited on the <b>folding</b> <b>surfaces</b> when the flexible-segment length increased from 8 to 10 CH 2 units. The concentration of short loops at <b>folding</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the disorder of <b>folding</b> <b>surfaces</b> increased when the molecular weight increased.

30|$|The SN/SNIC branch {{constitutes}} an edge where the surface folds and is formed by joining all the saddle nodes {{on the lower}} branches of the Z in the 2 D nullclines at each value of h_s. The presence of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation (magenta curve, labeled HB), introduced by the spiking currents, converts the branch of saddle nodes {{at the top of}} the Z into a limit point branch instead (blue curve, labeled LP). This is because, for most of its length in Fig.  5 a, instead of being comprised of nodes between an unstable and a stable branch as in the 2 D case, it is now mostly comprised of nodes between two unstable branches. This upper LP branch, like the lower SN branch, {{constitutes an}} edge where the surface folds back on itself; in contrast, the surface does not fold along the HB branch. The supercritical HB divides the top portion of the surface into stable (left side) and unstable (right side) regions.

40|$|A {{chemical}} synthesis platform with broad applications and flexibility was rationally designed to inhibit biogenesis of adhesive pili assembled by the chaperone–usher pathway in Gram-negative pathogens. The activity {{of a family}} of bicyclic 2 -pyridones, termed pilicides, was evaluated in two different pilus biogenesis systems in uropathogenic Escherichia coli. Hemagglutination mediated by either type 1 or P pili, adherence to bladder cells, and biofilm formation mediated by type 1 pili were all reduced by ≈ 90 % in laboratory and clinical E. coli strains. The structure of the pilicide bound to the P pilus chaperone PapD revealed that the pilicide bound {{to the surface of the}} chaperone known to interact with the usher, the outer-membrane assembly platform where pili are assembled. Point mutations in the pilicide-binding site dramatically reduced pilus formation but did not block the ability of PapD to bind subunits and mediate their <b>folding.</b> <b>Surface</b> plasmon resonance experiments confirmed that the pilicide interfered with the binding of chaperone–subunit complexes to the usher.

Propiece restriction fragments and oligonucleotide cassettes corresponding to 13 regions of the cathepsin D and glycopepsinogen amino lobes were randomly shuffled together to generate a large library of chimeric molecules. The library was inserted into an expression vector encoding the carboxyl lobe of cathepsin D with a carboxyl-terminal myc epitope and a CD 8 transmembrane extension. Transfected COS 1 cells expressing the membrane-anchored forms of the cathepsin D/glycopepsinogen chimeras at the cell surface were selected with solid phase mannose 6 -phosphate receptor or an antibody to the myc epitope. Plasmids were rescued in Escherichia coli and sequenced by hybridization to the original oligonucleotide cassettes. Two regions of the cathepsin D amino lobe (segments 7 and 12) were found to contribute to proper <b>folding,</b> <b>surface</b> expression, and selective phosphorylation of the carboxyl lobe oligosaccharide. Two different cathepsin D regions (the propiece and segment 5) cooperated with a previously identified recognition element in the carboxyl lobe to allow efficient phosphorylation of both the amino and carboxyl lobe oligosaccharides.

40|$|The wide-ranging {{survey of}} twisted growth in {{polymers}} by Lotz and Cheng cites extensive evidence {{consistent with the}} relief of surface stress being the underlying cause. This complementary note contributes to the discussion by making three main points. First, {{it is necessary to}} go further and explain the key issue of how a consistent twist is maintained when, as commonly, this habit has a lower symmetry than the crystallographic lattice. Detailed study has shown that, in polyethylene, this occurs by reorganization of the initial <b>fold</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Second, the suggested explanation by Keith and Padden that. in polyethylene, the asymmetric habit derives from molecules adding to lamellae with inclined <b>fold</b> <b>surfaces</b> is invalid being doubly inconsistent with observation. Third, twisting has now been linked to faster growth by study of row structures in polyethylene. This produces inherently rough <b>fold</b> <b>surfaces</b> in Regime II whose internal stresses drive reorganization and twisting. For slower (Regime I) growth, <b>fold</b> <b>surfaces</b> form with and maintain ordered packing so providing no basis for twisting. These new insights radically alter the context of twisted growth and provide a firm factual basis for further work. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

A kilometer long surface-slip gap exists just southwest of the fold, being bounded on the northeast with 75 mm of slip and to the southwest with about 60 mm of slip. Lateral slip continues southwesterly to the faults intersection with the Superstition Hills fault. The gentle-to-openly folded, moderately plunging, upright asymmetric anticline experienced left-lateral slip on the northern limb and right-oblique slip on the southern limb with maximum documented lateral slip along bedding planes of 10 mm. Slip values were greatest on the limbs and decreased to zero at the fold hinge, {{which is consistent with}} the flexural-slip folding process.

Previous ensemble studies of this 255 -nucleotide ribozyme described the equilibrium folding with two transitions, U-to-Ieq-to-N, {{and focused on}} the Ieq-to-N transition. The present study focuses on the U-to-Ieq transition. Comparative ensemble measurements of the ribozyme construct labeled with fluorescein at the 5 ′ end and Cy 3 at the 3 ′ end show that modifications required for labeling do not interfere with folding and help to define the Mg 2 + concentration range for the U-to-Ieq transition. Histogram analysis of the Mg 2 +-dependent single-molecule FRET efficiency reveals two previously undetermined folding intermediates. The single-molecule FRET trajectories exhibit non-two-state and nonergodic behaviors at intermediate Mg 2 + concentrations on the time scale of seconds. The trajectories at intermediate Mg 2 + concentrations are classified into five classes based on three FRET levels and their dynamics of interconversion within the measured time range. This heterogeneity, together with the observation of “nonsudden jump” FRET transitions, indicates that the early folding steps of this ribozyme involve a series of intermediates with different degrees of kinetic isolation and that folding occurs under kinetic control and involves many “local” conformational switches.

Truncated rhombic crystals were obtained with an aspect ratio that was strongly depended on the supercooling degree. The {{crystalline structure}} of both homopolyesters was defined by an orthorhombic P 2 (1) ab space group and a large unit cell containing four molecular segments with an all-trans conformation. Nevertheless, the structure in the chain axis projection was equivalent to a simpler cell containing only two segments. Crystalline lamellae were effectively degraded by lipases, starting the enzymatic attack on the lamellar surfaces. The random copolymer constituted by an equimolar amount of pimelate and azelate units (COPES 9, 7 / 9) crystallized according to regular lamellae with a similar molecular arrangement in the chain axis projection. The structure of this copolymer was preferably conditioned by the azelate component as could be deduced from both, diffraction and spectroscopic data.

40|$|Two high {{molecular}} weight (MW) isotactic polypropylene (i-PP) samples, one containing {{a small amount of}} rr stereodefects denoted R 1 and one conventional, commercial i-PP denoted S 1, were used to grow single crystals in thin films at high temperatures (Tx = 145 °C for R 1, Tx = 155 °C for S 1). Elongated R 2 -form lathlike single crystals could be found in these two samples, indicating that the growth of this type of single crystal is a general phenomenon in i-PP and is independent of the small amount of tacticity defects. On the basis of our selected area electron diffraction (SAED) experimental results, the stems in these lathlike single crystals were tilted at an unusual 17 ° angle around the b-axis (i. e., a rotation of 17 ° of the c-axis within the ac-plane toward the a-axis direction), while in the traditional scheme of the alpha-form in i-PP, the stem axis is understood to be normal to the <b>fold</b> <b>surface.</b> This 17 ° stem tilt in the alpha 2 -form, lathlike single crystals grown at high Tx values appears to depend upon two constraints: (a) the conformational restrictions on chirality and clinicity of isotactic polyolefin stems linked by a fold, as analyzed by Petraccone et al. [Polymer 1986, 27, 1665; Eur. Polym.

Structurally, OMPs vary {{in the number of}} β-strands and in the size and complexity of extra-membrane domains, with extreme examples being the members of the type V protein secretion system (T 5 SS), such as the autotrans- porter (AT) and intimin/invasin families of secreted proteins, in which a large extracellular “passenger” domain is linked to a β-barrel that inserts in the OM. Despite their structural and functional diversity, OMPs interact in the periplasm with a relatively small set of protein chaperones that facilitate their trans- port from the inner membrane (IM) to the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM complex), preventing aggregation and assisting their folding in various aspects including disulfide bond formation.

The PETT copolymers were synthesized via the polycondensation of terephthalate with ethylene glycol and trimethylene glycol (TG) in various compositions. The copolymers with 69. 0 mol % or more TG or 31. 0 mol % or less TG were crystallizable, but the other copolymers containing 34 - 56 mol % TG were amorphous. The DSC isothermal results revealed that {{the addition of a}} small amount of flexible TG (up to 21 mol %) to the PET structure slightly reduced the formation of three-dimensional spherulites. A greater TG concentration (91 - 100 %) in the copolyesters changed the crystal growth from two-dimensional to three-dimensional. The DSC heating scans after the completion of isothermal crystallization at various T(c) s showed three melting endotherms for PET, PETT- 88, PETT- 84, and PETT- 79 and four melting endotherms for PETT- 9 and PETT.

40|$|The melting and {{crystallization}} {{behavior of}} linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) {{is of great}} scientific and industrial importance. It depends strongly on polymer molecular structural characteristics and processing conditions, and determines polymer application properties. In this work, we study three different types of LLDPE polymers: metallocene-based LLDPEs (m-LLDPEs), Ziegler-Natta-based LLDPEs (ZN-LLDPEs), and m-LLDPE blends. A generalized equation is introduced to clarify conceptual definitions of polymer melting temperatures. It incorporates the effects of comonomer volume, crystal length, <b>folding</b> <b>surface</b> free energy and enthalpy of fusion. It is successful in describing the characteristic melting temperatures of various alpha-alkene-ethylene copolymers. The proposed equation is used, along with melting traces obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), to estimate the crystal size number distributions. Furthermore, the melting temperature characteristics are identified, using crystal size number distributions. The crystallization behavior of LLDPEs is studied by polarized light microscopy (PLM) and DSC. A modified Hoffman-Lauritzen (MHL) expression is proposed for the linear crystallization kinetics by replacing the equilibrium melting temperature, Tm 0, with the melting temperature of the crystal stem with the maximum possible length, TmC,n*. The concept of the effective nucleation induction time is introduced, in order to employ the Avrami equation to analyze the overall crystallization kinetics during the initial crystallization stage. The MHL analysis suggests the presence of three crystallization regimes: regimes III and II, and a special regime IM. The Avrami exponents are respectively 2, 1. 5, and 1 in these regimes. The typical optical morphology of LLDPEs is spherulitic. As the crystallization temperature increases, the morphology changes from spherulites without ring bands, to ring-banded spherulites and sometimes to irregular structure with rough ring bands. These structural characteristics seem to correspond to MHL regimes. Non-linear spherulitic growth behavior is observed in regimes II and IM. This behavior is explained by {{the reduction of the}} concentration of crystallizable ethylene sequences in the melt phase. The MHL expression may be still used to analyze non-linear growth crystallization kinetics by employing a variable TmC,n*...|$|E

The present thesis is based on the fact that a significant part of the students enters Architecture and Urbanism courses in general and, especially in UFRN, with difficulties of formal and spatial perception, a fact that has made impaired learning of the architectural project. Thus, to optimize the teaching / learning relationship, we argue that such a subject should be debated in an integrated way to other curricular components, especially associating geometry teaching with that of design, and using methods / techniques consistent with contemporary advances in the area. In order to find ways that could facilitate the development of visualization and the formal conception of the students, the object of study of this thesis was the use of paper folding techniques as a tool to aid the development of these skills in the first year of the architecture course and urbanism. Question: How do applied geometries, more specifically the folding techniques, influence the visualization and the formal conception? And how to use it to provide a better integration of the contents of the area of representation and language and architecture project in the first year of the course? It is hypothesized that, 1) the folding techniques are instruments capable of collaborating with the apprehension of the knowledge of geometry and promote the development of skills related to the visualization and conception of the form; 2) the application of exercises based on these techniques to students of the first year of the course, will be fundamental for the development of these skills. The general objective was to understand the insertion of new geometry instruments applied to formal design activities at the beginning of the course, pointing out elements for the integration of content between the Representation and Language and Architecture Design areas. To support this objective, three specific objectives were established: 1. To verify the effectiveness of the use of folding techniques in the development of formal visualization; 2. To verify the effectiveness of the use of folding techniques in the development of the formal design of architectural objects; 3. Establish recommendations for the improvement of teaching in this field that may subsidize the creation or reformulation of relevant curricular components. Besides the bibliographic research, the method to reach the proposed objectives involved the accomplishment of didactic experiences with undergraduate students in AU. Paper Folding techniques were used in these workshops; Surface Development; Origami and tessellation, fold creating repeating patterns that can be used in formal design. It was verified the potential of the fold as a tool of conception, since it allowed: the exploration of the concept of continuity and complexity; favoring the creation process; the vitalization of geometry, and the optimization of the teaching / learning relationship. The results of the empirical study indicated the potentiality of the use of the paper model; they pointed out the workshops as experiences capable of favoring the conception processes. Besides these factors, it was possible to perceive the presence of mimicry and geometry in the initial moments of the design of the form, through an integration exercise, defined by the methodology. These results supported the recommendations for the teaching of architectural design focused on the initial periods. No ensino universitário contemporâneo, a aprendizagem precisa ser vivenciada como fruto de um processo de construção contínuo, no qual o aprender ocorre por meio de processos dinâmicos de buscas, e é adquirido de forma integrada. A presente tese tem como base inicial a constatação de que parte significativa dos alunos ingressa nos cursos de Arquitetura e Urbanismo em geral e, em especial no da UFRN, com dificuldades de percepção formal e espacial, fato que tem prejudicado o aprendizado do projeto arquitetônico. Assim, para a otimização da relação ensino/aprendizagem, defendemos que tal assunto deveria ser debatido de maneira integrada a outros componentes curriculares, em especial associando, principalmente, o ensino de geometria ao de projeto, e usando métodos/técnicas condizentes com os avanços contemporâneos na área. A fim de buscar caminhos que pudessem facilitar o desenvolvimento da visualização e da concepção formal dos alunos, o objeto de estudo dessa tese foi a utilização de técnicas de dobradura em papel, como instrumento de auxílio ao desenvolvimento dessas habilidades no primeiro ano do curso de arquitetura e urbanismo. Pergunta-se: Como a geometria aplicada, mais especificamente as técnicas de dobraduras, influenciam a visualização e a concepção formal? Como utilizá-la para proporcionar uma melhor integração dos conteúdos da área de representação e linguagem e de projeto de arquitetura no primeiro ano do curso? Temos, como hipóteses que: 1) as técnicas de dobraduras são instrumentos capazes de colaborar com a apreensão do conhecimento da geometria e promover o desenvolvimento das habilidades relacionadas à visualização e concepção da forma; 2) a aplicação de exercícios baseados nestas técnicas em alunos do primeiro ano do curso será fundamental para o desenvolvimento dessas habilidades. O objetivo geral foi compreender a inserção de novos instrumentos da geometria aplicada às atividades de concepção formal em início de curso, apontando elementos para o exercício da integração de conteúdos entre as áreas de ‘Representação e Linguagem’ e ‘Projeto de Arquitetura’. Para subsidiar tal objetivo, estabeleceram-se três objetivos específicos: 1. Verificar a eficácia da utilização de técnicas de dobraduras no desenvolvimento da visualização formal; 2. Verificar a eficácia da utilização de técnicas de dobraduras no desenvolvimento da concepção formal de objetos arquitetônicos; 3. Estabelecer recomendações para a melhoria do ensino neste campo que possam subsidiar a criação ou reformulação de componentes curriculares a ele pertinentes. Além da pesquisa bibliográfica, o método para atingir os objetivos propostos envolveu a realização de experiências didáticas com estudantes de graduação em AU. Nessas oficinas, foram aplicadas técnicas de Paper <b>Folding,</b> <b>Surface</b> Development, Origami e tessellation. Verificamos o potencial da dobra como ferramenta de concepção, uma vez que permitiu: a exploração do conceito de continuidade e complexidade; o favorecimento do processo de criação e a otimização da relação ensino/aprendizagem. Os resultados do estudo empírico indicaram a potencialidade do uso da maquete de papel e a função das oficinas como experiências capazes de favorecer os processos de concepção. Além destes fatores, foi possível perceber a presença do mimetismo e da geometria nos momentos iniciais de concepção da forma, por meio de um exercício de integração, definido pela metodologia. Estes resultados fundamentaram as recomendações para o ensino de projeto de arquitetura voltado para os períodos iniciais...|$|E

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and thermal}} stability of different sectors in solution- and melt-grown crystals of star-branched polyesters with poly(Îµ-caprolactone) (PCL) arms, {{and of a}} reference linear PCL, have been studied by tapping-mode atomic-force microscopy (AFM). Real-time monitoring of melt-crystallization in thin films of star-branched and linear PCL has been performed using hot-stage AFM. A striated <b>fold</b> <b>surface</b> was observed in both solution- and melt-grown crystals of both star-branched and linear PCL. The presence of striations in the melt-grown crystals proved that this structure was genuine and not due {{to the collapse of}} tent-shaped crystals. The crystals of the star-branched polymers had smoother <b>fold</b> <b>surfaces,</b> which {{can be explained by the}} presence of dendritic cores close to the <b>fold</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The single crystals of linear PCL grown from solution showed earlier melting in the { 100 } sectors than in the { 110 } sectors, whereas no such sectorial dependence of the melting was found in the solution-grown crystals of the star-branched polymers. The proximity of the dendritic cores to the <b>fold</b> <b>surface</b> yields at least one amorphous PCL repeating unit next to the dendritic core and more nonadjacent and less sharp chain folding than in linear PCL single crystals; this evidently erased the difference in thermal stability between the { 110 } and { 100 } sectors. Melt-crystallization in thin polymer films at 53 - 55 Â°C showed 4 times faster crystal growth along b than along a, and more irregular crystals with niches on the lateral faces in star-branched PCL than in linear PCL. Crystal growth rate was strictly constant with time. Multilayer crystals with central screw dislocation (growing with or without reorientation of the b-axis) and twisting were observed in both classes of polymers...|$|R

All the analyses revealed that the incorporation of the IF-WS 2 altered significantly the crystallization behavior of PPS, in a way strongly dependent with the nanocomposite composition. The addition of IF-WS 2 in 0. 1 wt % proportion retarded the crystallization of PPS by increasing its <b>fold</b> <b>surface</b> free energy in a 10 %.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{formation of}} a single polymer chain with 500 CH_ 2 groups is studied by the molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations show that the bond-orientationally ordered structure at low temperatures is formed from a random-coil structure at high temperatures by a gradual stepwise cooling. From the radii of gyration and the bond-orientational order parameters, {{it is found that}} the anisotropy of a polymer chain also grows during the growth of the bond-orientational order. In the bond-orientationally ordered structure at low temperatures, 16 stems form a structure with deformed hexagonal symmetry and the stems in the outer layer have a tilted conflguration. Furthermore, the gauche states are localized in the <b>fold</b> <b>surface</b> and the conformational states in the <b>fold</b> <b>surface</b> change more readily than those in the orientationally-ordered region. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{geometries}} and {{densities of}} fractures associated with fold structures can be predicted by {{assuming that the}} strains accommodated by fractures mimic the bulk strains induced in the strata during folding. This paper examines, from a theoretical standpoint, the distributions of bedding-plane strains expected in folds formed by various folding mechanisms. The relationship between the state of bedding-plane strain and fold-surface geometry is found to vary according to different fold types, distinguished {{on the basis of}} their curvature properties. The first type are developable <b>fold</b> <b>surfaces,</b> which have Gaussian curvature equal to zero. Folding mechanisms which are dominated by the mechanical strength of the layering, such as buckling, produce surfaces of this type. Folds of this type allow the possibility of estimating the bedding-plane strains from the geometrical features of the <b>folded</b> layer. Neutral <b>surface</b> <b>folds</b> and flexural-slip folds are discussed as examples. The other main class of <b>folds</b> have non-developable <b>surfaces,</b> which have non-zero Gaussian curvature. <b>Folded</b> <b>surfaces</b> with this form arise predominantly from mechanisms that involve the passive deflection of the layering in response to displacement gradients originating outside of the layer, e. g. drape folding. Although the geometry of these surfaces implies the presence of bedding plane strains, the quantification of these strains cannot be made from the fold geometry but requires additional information on these displacement patterns...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwisting of polymer {{lamellae}} manifested by e. g. {{appearance of}} concentric bands in polymer spherulites examined in a polarized optical microscope remains {{a topic of}} research and controversy. It has been interpreted variously as resulting from phenomena that take place during growth or from structural features of individual lamellae, or multilamellar aggregates. Phenomena that take place during growth are of general, or even generic character. They include non-linear diffusion processes leading to rhythmic crystallization, or self-induced compositional or mechanical fields generated near the advancing crystal front. Structural features include cumulative reorientation of lamellae at successive isochiral screw dislocations (possibly linked with surface pressure exerted by cilia) or different surface stresses on opposite <b>fold</b> <b>surfaces</b> of individual lamellae, {{as a result of}} different levels of congestion of folds. This contribution reviews evidence that has accumulated in favor of lamellar twist induced by surface stresses that result from differential congestion of <b>fold</b> <b>surfaces,</b> as suggested initially (in 1984) and advocated for many years by Keith and Padden. Such differences in <b>fold</b> <b>surface</b> structure are occasionally amenable to experimental (even if only qualitative) verification, as illustrated by polymer decoration of polyethylene single crystals. Twist is expected when a two-fold symmetry parallel to the growth direction exists in the lamellar structure (crystalline core and <b>fold</b> <b>surface).</b> This symmetry often stems from chirality: most frequently atomic (configurational) or stem (conformational) chirality but chirality (or at least asymmetry) may also be introduced by chain tilt. Possible origins of twisting in chiral polymers are also reviewed. In β sheets of fibrous proteins, the origin of twist stems from the atomic chiral centers in the crystalline core of the lamellae and its transfer to higher structural levels via the strong structural identity of the hydrogen-bonded β sheets. However, in a series of synthetic liquid-crystalline main-chain nonracemic chiral polyesters, the lamellar twist sense depends on the odd or even numbers of atoms in the aliphatic segment. For these and other more flexible chiral polymers, often with helical chain conformation, twisting appears to result from surface stresses associated with different fold structure or conformations at opposite <b>fold</b> <b>surfaces,</b> as suggested by a preliminary analysis of the Form III of isotactic poly(1 -butene). Such differences in fold conformations result from, but are not directly related to, the specific helical hand of the polymer since they rest on the details of the chain conformation as it reaches the <b>fold</b> <b>surface.</b> This analysis accounts for the lack of one-to-one correspondence between configurational or conformational chirality of the polymer and lamellar twist sense (the one-to-one correspondence applies however for stereoenantiomers of a given polymer). Twist is not the only known non-planar geometry of polymer lamellae. In a few cases, the lamellae are scrolled. Scrolling of polymer lamellae is also easily accounted for by the existence of surface stresses when the two-fold symmetry parallel to the growth direction is absent. Such surface stresses are again linked to disparities in fold volume, as first suggested for poly(vinylidenefluoride) in its γ Form and later for two long paraffins substituted near their middle carbon atom and that crystallize in hairpin fashion, and for scrolled crystals of polyamide 66. The different nature and structure of polymer crystal <b>fold</b> <b>surfaces,</b> therefore, offer an unusual opportunity to decouple surface and bulk contributions and to analyze the origin of non-planar lamellar geometries at a sub-molecular level. Fold structure disparities and resulting unbalanced surface stresses provide a unified explanation for the formation of non-planar (both twisted and scrolled) lamellar crystals. They account for both the diversity of lamellar morphologies produced under the same crystallization conditions and for the similarity of lamellar morphologies produced under very different crystallization conditions...|$|R

The polymer matrix was isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and the inorganic fillers were molybdenum disulfide nanotubes (MoS(2)). The effect of INT-MoS(2) concentration and the crystallization temperature on the isothermal crystallization behavior of iPP was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXS). It has been observed that INT-MoS(2) affects the crystallization of nanocomposites remarkably, which can be attributed to the nucleating effect of INT-MoS(2) on the monoclinic α-crystal form of iPP. Other parameters such as the Avrami exponent and the <b>fold</b> <b>surface</b> free energy of crystallization of iPP chains in the nanocomposites were obtained in order to determine the effect of the INT-MoS(2) on them.
