40|$|Carbon offset is {{one type}} of {{flexibility}} mechanism in greenhouse gas emission trading schemes that helps nations meet their emission commitments at lower costs. Carbon offsets take advantage of lower abatement cost opportunities from unregulated sectors and regions, {{which can be used}} to offset the emissions from regulated nations and sectors. Carbon offsets can also meet multiple objectives; for example, the Clean Development Mechanism in the Kyoto Protocol encourages Annex I countries to promote low carbon sustainable projects in developing countries in exchange for carbon offsets. Alternatively, the costs under cap-and-trade policies are subjected to uncertainties due to uncertainties about technology, energy markets, and emissions. There are several cost-containment instruments to address cost uncertainties, such as banking, borrowing, safety valve, and allowance reserves. Although carbon offsets are verified to reduce expected compliance costs by providing a surplus of cheap allowances that can be used by Annex I countries to help meet their commitments, they have yet to be studied as a cost-containment instrument. Carbon offsets could potentially be a cost-containment instrument as purchasing carbon offsets during instances of high carbon price volatility could potentially provide some relief from high prices. This paper analyzes the effect of carbon offsets on carbon prices, specifically under carbon price uncertainty. I use carbon offsets from abatement activities that reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) as a case study example. My results show that carbon offsets reduce upside costs and thus can be an alternative cost-containment instrument, but cost-effectiveness can be limited by supply uncertainties, offset purchasing restrictions, emission target stringency and competition over demand. Carbon offsets, such as REDD, can serve as a <b>flexibility</b> <b>instrument</b> for developed nations, encourage global participation in reducing GHG emissions, and provide sustainable development support to developing nations. by Jieun Kim.

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} analyse recent shifts in goals {{concerning}} domestic energy uses. Drawing on two Dutch smart grid projects, we observe {{that in the}} smart grid transition the balancing of (renewable) supply and demand in energy grids becomes the key priority of grid managers. This shift becomes translated at the household level through so called ‘teleoaffective structures’ of energy practices which motivate and direct the behaviour of householders towards flexible timing-of-demand. New grid objectives are codified in the rules of social practice concerning the use of <b>flexibility</b> <b>instruments</b> (notably time-of-day pricing) and are materialized in monitoring devices, smart appliances, and energy storage. We investigated which domestic practices are most open for flexible timing-of-use.

In the concluding section, we argue that householder engagement with sustainability goals should be safeguarded from the <b>flexibility</b> <b>instruments,</b> goals and strategies that seem to turn this engagement into grid management performed for financial benefits only. </p...|$|R

40|$|The paper first {{argues that}} the Directive for EU-wide {{greenhouse}} gas emission trading still carries a number of weaknesses, such as:. still no clear link with other climate policies in the Member States;. the subsidiarity {{with regard to the}} allocation of allowances may distort intra-EU competition;. lack of clarity as to what the (future) scope and coverage of the scheme may look like.

30|$|The {{relatively}} mild {{reaction of}} the German labor market to the Great Recession 2008 / 09 was often called the “German Miracle”. However, various reasons are able to explain this unusual response. First, the economic crisis mostly hit financially strong firms coming from a long upswing leading towards to the crisis. These firms were able to hoard labor deliberately due {{to a number of}} working-time <b>flexibility</b> <b>instruments</b> at the firm as well as the state level. Second, in the years prior to the Great Recession, Germany had introduced profound reforms of the labor market, which fundamentally changed its institutional settings as well as income support systems and overall led to higher working incentives and better matching between labor demand and supply. There was also a considerable reframing of ALMPs {{in the course of the}} labor market reforms, which led to a broad collection on evaluation results providing sound guidance for policy makers in further developing the institutional framework to adjust to structural changes on the labor market. Overall, it is fair to say that Germany has been on the right track with the main reforms of the labor market for the last 10 years.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} reasons why {{economic}} instruments of climate change are reluctantly applied and stresses the need for interdisciplinary research linking economic theory and empirical testing to deliberative political procedures. It is divided in three parts. The first one recalls the main issues in implementing Cost-Benefit Analysis such as information problems, uncertainties, discounting the future and irreversibilities. The second part shows how these issues can be treated in integrated assessment and techno-economic models and presents a case study, which shows that *The chosen scenario tends to stabilize atmospheric CO 2 concentration at around 550 ppm in the long run. *Exclusion of possibility to trade CO 2 emission permits under a cap regime would increase the cost of mission abatement for OECD countries. *Combining different <b>flexibility</b> <b>instruments</b> might lead to significant gains in the overall cost of climate policy. The third part presents results of a survey conducted among the main economic and environmental assocations in Switzerland. The survey reveals conflicting views on economic instruments. It shows how the social acceptability of these instruments can be improved in taking expicitly into account these opposing views of special interest groups. Therefore, policy scenarios should be selected in combining techno-economic models with empirical studies about their political and normative context...|$|R

The report presents a design for national emission trading schemes and rules for linking them {{to form an}} international scheme. A national and international cap and trade scheme {{as well as a}} credit trading scheme based on performance standards have been worked out. Next to design issues the market performance and political acceptation of types of national and international emission trading are discussed. A major conclusion trading is that cap and trade is the most effective and efficient national and international option, but credit trade is politically more feasible. The conditions for adequate functioning of tradeable permit schemes as well as potential market failures (high transaction cost, abuse of market power and non cost minimizing behaviour) have been assessed. As a potential type of international market failure the abuse of emission trading schemes as instrument of trade policy has been identified. The question whether differences in national permit schemes could distort international competition on product markets is also discussed.

40|$|Manufacturing {{companies}} face stronger {{fluctuations in}} customer demand driven by volatile markets with even shorter lead times and decreasing predictability. Manufacturing companies therefore {{need to increase}} their responsiveness by organizing the flexibility within their personnel capacity {{which is one of}} the most relevant cost factors in manufacturing. Thus the flexible adjustment of human resource (HR) capacity represents a significant advantage in competitiveness for future business sustainability. This in conflict with the current situation as manufacturing companies don not have planning tools or methods for a systematic planning and utilization of the HR-flexibility in volatile markets. Although manufacturing companies already utilize several instruments to adapt HR capacities to markets demand (e. g. temporary work, working time accounts). The planning and application of these instruments is often based on experience rather than on a systematic methodology. Systematic planning of HR flexibility can only be ensured by proactive planning at the tactical log-termed level. Therefore a reference framework is required, that leads companies to dimension their HR-flexibility on the long term and make them able to use the right <b>flexibility</b> <b>instruments</b> from long term to short term periods. The German research project “KapaflexCy” aims at creating high flexible utilization of HR capacity in manufacturing companies using industry 4. 0 principles like mobile devices and social media. To ensure the systematic utilization of the right HR- flexibility a reference framework is created. The paper describes the need for systematic planning of HR-flexibility and the developed reference framework...|$|R
40|$|In several {{regions of}} the world, the share of {{intermittent}} renewables (such as wind and solar PV) in electricity generation is rapidly increasing. The current share of these renewable energy sources (RES) can still {{more or less be}} handled by existing systems and flexibility, benefiting from remaining excess capacity of dispatchable (backup) generation and links to other grids that can balance the intermittency. However, often higher levels of intermittent RES are envisaged for the future, posing significant challenges on system operation and planning. In assessing possible energy futures, long-term energy system models are typically used. The representation of RES in such models needs careful attention, as intermittent RES come with a number of specific characteristics, making them different from conventional dispatchable generation. This paper focuses on technical implications related to systems trying to achieve high shares of renewable electricity. The relevance of demand and RES generation profiles are demonstrated. After some threshold, a sharp decreasing relationship between installed RES capacity and marginal contribution in terms of generation is identified; therefore, even with perfect backup, a technical limit exists on achievable RES shares. The impact of RES on net demand peak reduction is also addressed. In the absence of system flexibility, substantial backup is required to ensure reliable electricity provision. The role of different <b>flexibility</b> <b>instruments</b> is explored and is found to be significant. Reflections are provided on options to include these aspects in long-term energy system models...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change will}} bring about {{unprecedented}} economic, social and environmental effects, which require both the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation to its adverse effects. Water is the main element through which the impacts of climate change will be felt. Climate change results in increased uncertainties, complexities, stress and potential for conflicts within water management, both among and within states. New forms of governance are needed if the world is {{to respond to the}} need to adapt to changes in freshwater supply and to manage water security risks. This paper suggests that adaptive governance should to be main-streamed into all water regulation to ensure the availability of and access to safe water resources and to prevent water-related conflicts. The paper discusses the concept of water security in the context of climate change, the threats that climate change poses to water security, and the concept and implications of adaptive governance as a possible solution. The application of adaptive governance requires a certain degree of institutional and normative <b>flexibility,</b> <b>instruments</b> and institutions that can respond and adapt to changes and manage the level of uncertainty associated with the impacts of climate change.

30|$|The third aspect {{refers to}} the type of {{transmission}} mechanism through which the crisis was hitting Germany. Whereas Ireland, Spain and the United States had to deal with burdens resulting from structural adjustments due to the real estate crisis and turmoil within the financial sector, Germany had not experienced a housing bubble and was instead facing a fierce output decline due to a shortfall of world trade (Burda and Hunt 2011). This output decline primarily hit the export oriented manufacturing sector in Germany, which had experienced a strong upswing in the three previous years leading up to the crisis in 2008 with an output growth rate being twice as high compared to the aggregate economy (Möller 2010). Another established empirical fact is that firms engaging in international trade are more productive and innovative than non-exporting firms and, in the case of Germany, are mostly located in the manufacturing sector (Wagner 2011). Hence, the Great Recession hit the strongest firms coming from an upswing with profit shares between 42 % and 45 % in the three years leading up to the crisis (Eurostat 2012). Because of the foregone upswing, workers in the manufacturing sector had also accumulated a significant surplus of working hours on their working time accounts, which could then be used up during the crisis. It should also be stressed that <b>flexibility</b> <b>instruments</b> only work well if they are used to dampen a demand shock that has been induced externally and only lasts {{for a short period of}} time. This is why it worked in Germany better than in other European countries with similar schemes (Arpaia et al. 2010).|$|R

30|$|The {{reaction}} of the German labor market to the Great Recession 2008 / 09 was – especially compared to other countries – relatively mild. This “German Miracle” occurred due to various reasons. On the one hand, Germany had to – unlike countries such as Ireland and the United States, which both faced a slump in domestic demand combined with a real estate crisis – deal with a world demand shock that mostly affected economically strong firms (Rinne and Zimmermann 2011; Schneider and Gräf 2010). On the other hand, various <b>flexibility</b> <b>instruments</b> at the firm level, combined with discretionary adjustments of the institutional framework by policy makers (i.e. enhancement of the short-time work schemes), enabled firms to adjust their workforce along the internal rather than the external margin (Möller 2010). In addition, far reaching labor market reforms between 2002 and 2005, initiated to fight the high and persistent unemployment that had evolved {{since the end of}} the seventies, had significantly altered the core elements of the labor market, including active and passive labor market policies, the organizational structure of labor offices as well as the pension system. The speed and depth of the reforms were quite remarkable when it is considered that the German welfare state had been typically depicted as the prime example of a “frozen welfare state”, highly resistant to change (see, among others, Esping-Andersen 1990; Manow and Seils 2000; Kemmerling and Bruttel 2005; Konle-Seidl et al. 2010). In summary, the actions taken during the reforms led to higher working incentives and better matching between labor demand and supply in the period before the Great Recession, and were therefore considered as one of the main reasons for the mild reaction (Gartner and Klinger 2010). The reforms also had the general goal of increasing the labor force participation of those with young families.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Nickel-titanium {{rotary files}} were {{originally}} developed {{to allow for}} greater <b>flexibility</b> when <b>instrumenting</b> root canals. The increased <b>flexibility</b> of nickel-titanium <b>instruments</b> allowed operators to negotiate canal curvatures with greater ease. File design is continually changing. Manufacturers are trying to produce files that will work more efficiently and safely. Knowing the properties of files marketed is especially important in helping to choose an appropriate file system. Current ISO standards require force measurements at a static point along the file. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the flexibility of four different nickel-titanium files at three different points along the file. Materials and Methods: Flexibility of four different nickel-titanium rotary files (EndoSequence, ProFile, Vortex, and Vortex Blue) was measured. Each file was clamped at 3 mm, 5 mm, or 7 mm (n = 10 /length/file) and a universal testing machine was used to bend the files to a maximum deflection of 4. 5 mm. All data were statistically analyzed by two-way analysis of variance and post-hoc Tukey test (P = 0. 05) to determine any significant differences. Results: Statistically significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) differences were present. In general, ProFile was the stiffest, displaying the greatest force and bending moment values. Vortex Blue was significantly more flexible, with lower force needed for deflection and bending moments.

As evidence of the use that firms have made of the various <b>flexibility</b> <b>instruments</b> available to help reduce the volume of labour, part-time employment increased in 2009, at the expense of full-time jobs, mainly because of the shift from full-time work schedules towards shorter working hours.

Large enterprises had to face more staff cuts than SMEs. Among the different branches of activity, job losses were the heaviest in industry, followed by the financial services and insurance sector. Some job creation was still observed in certain branches, including health and social work. Workers affected by temporary lay-offs for economic reasons and by the crisis measures remain on their employer’s staff register, which has tended to limit the drop in the number of workers in employment, while the volume of hours worked, which is directly influenced by these measures, felt considerably in 2009.
