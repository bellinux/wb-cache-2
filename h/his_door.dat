5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had been {{replaced}} by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> off the train into a torrent of hail and thunder and walked the few hundred yards to the vicarage, frequently losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train and went on to Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, the Beales are {{informed}} by DI Samantha Keeble (Alison Newman) {{that the police}} have a new DCI dealing {{with the murder of}} Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), who is making an arrest. At Phil's house, Marsden knocks on <b>his</b> <b>door</b> and Phil is shocked to see her. Marsden wants to speak to Ben about Lucy's murder, but Phil slams the door in her face and then attempts to delay Marsden so Ben can flee Walford, but Ben is eventually arrested.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately for Brian, {{when his}} novel is released, it is universally panned by {{literary}} critics {{and does not}} sell a single copy. Brian laments that he sacrificed his core beliefs for nothing, but Lois intervenes because he helped ban cannabis (and she also points out how Stewie got to build a nice fort from all of Brian's unsold books). A distraught Quagmire arrives at the household and informs Peter that he is still looking for James and offers a reward of $50. Peter nonchalantly takes the reward, admits that he killed him and slams <b>his</b> <b>door</b> before Quagmire {{has a chance to}} react.|$|E

5|$|Yabuhara hires Hanada to kill four men, {{the first}} three being a customs officer, an ocularist and a {{jewellery}} dealer. Hanada snipes the first from behind a billboard's animatronic cigarette lighter, shoots the second from a basement up through a pipe drain when the latter leans over the sink and, ordered to finish quickly, blasts {{his way into the}} third's office and escapes on an advertising balloon. Misako then appears at <b>his</b> <b>door</b> and offers him a nearly impossible contract to kill a foreigner, which he cannot refuse having just been told the plan.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Skinner {{visits the}} Lone Gunmen, who are {{monitoring}} UFO {{activity in the}} United States {{in the hopes of}} tracking down Mulder. Skinner later finds out that someone has used Mulder's FBI pass {{to gain access to the}} X-Files, and that the Bureau task force considers him the main suspect. Meanwhile, Doggett has gathered enough evidence to track Mulder's whereabouts before his so-called abduction, discovering that Mulder was dying and had his name engraved in his family's gravestone to mark his death in 2000. Later on, more evidence of high UFO activity in Clifton, Arizona is found by The Lone Gunmen. Concurrently, Doggett receives information about Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka) when someone slips his file under <b>his</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ritter leaves Scully {{staking out}} Fellig's apartment, but Scully is unnerved {{when she sees}} Fellig {{shooting}} photos of her out his window and bangs on <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> demanding to know how he took photos {{at a crime scene}} before the police even knew the crime had been committed. He invites her to take a ride with him so he can show her. After driving, he sees a prostitute who appears to be gray to him. Fellig tells Scully that the woman will be dead very soon. A pimp approaches the woman and begins to harass her. Scully leaps out of the car with her gun, announcing that she is an FBI agent and handcuffing the pimp, but when the prostitute tries to flee, she is hit by a truck and killed.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Tom (Shearsmith), a primary school teacher, apathetically marking work while chatting {{to his girlfriend}} Gerri (Arterton), {{who is going to}} {{audition}} for a part in a play. Tom complains about a tramp begging outside their house. Later in the evening, Tom is home alone and Migg (Pemberton), the tramp, comes to <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> to return Tom's wallet. Tom rewards him with £40. Migg comes back later with a bottle of whiskey for Tom. Reluctantly, Tom invites Migg inside for a drink.

5|$|The voice {{once again}} speaks to Isaac's mother, stating that Isaac must {{be cut off}} from all that is evil in the world. Once again, his mother obliges, and locks Isaac inside his room. Once more, the voice speaks to Isaac's mother. It states she has done well, but it still {{questions}} her devotion, and tells her to sacrifice her son. She obliges, grabbing a butcher's knife {{from the kitchen and}} walking to Isaac's room. Isaac, watching through a sizable crack in <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor hidden under his rug and jumps in, just before his mother opens his bedroom door. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which becomes the title screen.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} folk {{tales of the}} Tylwyth Teg, the fairy people who {{inhabited}} the area and an invisible land in Cardigan Bay. One tells of a farmer from Aberdaron {{who was in the}} habit of stepping outside his house before retiring to bed. One night he was spoken to by a stranger, who asked why the farmer was annoyed by him. The farmer, confused, asked what the stranger meant and was told to stand with one foot on the stranger's. This he did, and could see another house, just below his own, and that all the farm's slops went down the chimney of the invisible house. The stranger asked if the farmer would move <b>his</b> <b>door</b> {{to the other side of}} the house, which the farmer subsequently did, walling up the original door; from that day, the farmer's livestock flourished, and he became one of the most prosperous men in the area.|$|E

5|$|They {{arrived at}} Cologne on July 29, visiting the Cologne Cathedral before {{continuing}} on to Berlin. Kalākaua stayed in his Berlin accommodations {{and took care}} of his correspondence the first full day of his stay, with German soldiers standing vigil outside <b>his</b> <b>door.</b> He received boisterous expressions of public approval wherever he appeared. During their stay, they attended several military displays and toured museums, castles, and other sites of interest. The King was entertained by the future Kaiser Wilhelm II and his wife, who were receiving him on behalf of Wilhelm's grandfather, the German Emperor. On a visit to Potsdam with Prince Charles of Prussia, Kalākaua was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Red Eagle. Armstrong rejoined the group in Germany, but was too ill to accompany them on their outings. They departed for Vienna on August 4.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{had been}} {{hardening}} {{on the matter}} of slavery, and Democrats accused Harrison of being an abolitionist because of his membership, a half century earlier, in the Richmond Humane Society, an anti-slavery group; he had posted a mixed record on the issue while in Congress. On August 20, he gave a speech on the slave question at Carthage, Ohio, and stated that what occurred regarding slavery in a state was that state's business alone. He ignored the question of slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories, both {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal government. The general had pledged that <b>his</b> <b>door</b> would always be open to his old soldiers, but others came as well, and he hosted an unending series of guests. This was especially difficult for him on Sundays, when his wife forbade political discussion. The economy continued to be poor in 1840, a fact that the Whigs never ceased to press, arguing that Van Buren had done little, and that Harrison's inauguration was needed to put a stop to the hard times.|$|E

25|$|Even the Islamic Prophet Muhammad was {{subjected}} to such abuse; while he was praying near the Kaaba, Aqaba Bin Muiitt threw the entrails of a sacrificed camel over him. Abu Lahab's wife Umm Jamil would regularly dump filth outside <b>his</b> <b>door</b> and placed thorns in the path to his house.|$|E
25|$|Without {{going outside}} <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking {{out from his}} window, one sees the Tao of Heaven.

Therefore the sages got their {{knowledge}} without travelling; gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so.|$|E

60|$|Not so with Dr. Etherington. Habit (to {{say nothing}} of my own merits) had {{attached}} him to one who owed so much to his care, and <b>his</b> <b>doors</b> were always as open {{to me as if}} I had been his own son.|$|R
50|$|The {{evolution}} of Stelbel frames continued unabated until 1990, {{arriving at the}} production of aluminum frames and the first mountain bikes in Italy. That year, due to problems of a private nature, Stelio Belletti was forced to close <b>his</b> <b>doors</b> with very little notice.|$|R
25|$|In a {{much later}} {{interpolated}} detail, Ares put the young soldier Alectryon by <b>his</b> <b>door</b> to warn them of Helios's arrival as Helios would tell Hephaestus of Aphrodite's infidelity {{if the two}} were discovered, but Alectryon fell asleep on guard duty. Helios discovered the two and alerted Hephaestus. The furious Ares turned the sleepy Alectryon into a rooster which now always announces {{the arrival of the}} sun in the morning.|$|E
25|$|For reasons unknown, Pope Innocent X {{reneged on}} the deal and Antonio and his brother Taddeo were accused of {{financial}} abuses during the War of Castro. The two went into exile in 1645 in Paris {{under the protection of}} Cardinal Mazarin, and were joined a year later by Francesco. Before leaving Rome, Antonio had the crest of the King of France affixed above <b>his</b> <b>door</b> as a warning to his political rivals that he was now protected by the French Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Antikainen was {{allegedly}} {{killed in a}} plane crash near Arkhangelsk in October 1941. As he had openly critizised the Soviet leaders, some believe that his death was not an accident. According to the memoir of the exile Austrian communist Ruth von Mayenburg, Antikainen stayed at the Hotel Lux in Moscow and jumped out of the window as the NKVD officers were breaking <b>his</b> <b>door.</b> It is also claimed that he was assassinated by the later head of the Soviet Union Yuri Andropov, because Antikainen tried to take his place in the Komsomol of the Soviet Karelo-Finnish Republic.|$|E
50|$|Each Sufi of Gaya {{has learned}} spiritual lessons from him. This {{is why he}} is known as Amir-ul-Mashaiq (the master of all masters). Sufis {{throughout}} the order felt extremely impressed by his spirituality after meeting him. His personality was unparalleled all over Bihar.Ulema and Sufi loved his company and he loved to impart spiritual lessons to everyone. There have many converts to Islam at his hands. Even Wahhabi and Deobandi accept him as the true leader of the Muslim community. He is very soft-spoken and not any seeker of any particular thing, Knowledge, Spirituality, Tranquility, or wealth. No one, even a child returns empty-handed from <b>his</b> <b>doors.</b> <b>His</b> <b>doors</b> of the Khanqah are still open for everyone, around the clock.|$|R
60|$|And {{from the}} same center acts the great {{function}} {{of the heart and}} breath. Ah, the aspiration, the aspiration, like a hope, like a yearning constant and unfailing with which we take in breath. When we breathe, when we take in breath, it is not as when we take in food. When we breathe in we aspire, we yearn towards the heaven of air and light. And when the heart dilates to draw in the stream of dark blood, it opens its arms as to a beloved. It dilates with reverent joy, as a host opening <b>his</b> <b>doors</b> to an honored guest, whom he delights to serve: opening <b>his</b> <b>doors</b> to the wonder which comes to him from beyond, and without which he were nothing.|$|R
