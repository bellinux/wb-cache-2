40|$|This paper {{explains}} that <b>financial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> exist because of difficulties in enforcing contracts and shows that elements of deposit-insurance schemes differ substantially across countries.

2500|$|While in {{the offing}} of an ASEAN common currency, {{the leaders of the}} member-states of ASEAN agreed in November 1999 to create the {{establishment}} of currency swaps, and repurchase agreements, as a credit line against future financial shocks. In May 2000, the finance minister of the ASEAN agreed through the [...] "Chiang Mai Initiative" [...] to plan for closer monetary and financial co-operation. The [...] "Chiang Mai Initiative" [...] or CMI, named after the City of Chiang Mai in Thailand, has two components: an expanded ASEAN Swap Arrangement, and a network of bilateral swap arrangements among ASEAN countries, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. The ASEAN Swap Arrangement or ASA preceded the regional financial crisis. ASA was originally established by the ASEAN central bank and monetary authorities of the five founding members of ASEAN with a view to help countries meet temporary liquidity problems. An expanded ASA now includes all ten ASEAN countries with an expanded facility of US$1 billion. In recognition of the economic interdependence of East Asia, which has a combined foreign exchange reserves amounting to about US$1 trillion, a network of bilateral swap arrangements and repurchase agreements among ASEAN countries, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea has been agreed upon. The supplementary facility aims to provide temporary financing for members which may be in balance-of-payments difficulties. In 200, 16 bilateral swap arrangements (BSAs) have been successfully concluded with a combined amount of about US$35.5 billion. The original CMI was signed on 9 December 2009 which took effect on 20 March 2014, while the amended version, the multilateralisation of CMI (CMIM), was on 17 July 2014. CMIM is a multilateral currency swap arrangement with a total size of US$240 billion, governed by a single contractual agreement, while the CMI is a network of bilateral swap arrangements among the [...] "Plus Three" [...] and ASEAN countries' authorities. In addition, an independent regional surveillance unit called the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established to monitor and analyse regional economies, and to support the CMIM decision-making process. The amendments will effectively allow access of the ASEAN+3 member countries and Hong Kong to an enhanced CMIM package, which includes, among others, the doubling of the fund size from US$120 billion to US$240 billion, an increase in the level of access not linked to an International Monetary Fund program from 20%–30%, [...] and the introduction of a crisis prevention facility. These amendments are expected to fortify CMIM as the region's <b>financial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> in the event of any potential or actual liquidity difficulty.|$|E

First, as regards coverage, deposit insurance systems with low levels of coverage and/or partial insurance may not be effective in preventing bank runs. Second, for an explicit deposit insurance system to be effective, depositors need to understand the extent of and limits to existing deposit protection schemes. Third, when different institutions are entrusted with responsibilities that are relevant in a crisis situation, ex ante arrangements delimiting the scope of the different responsibilities as well as the respective powers may not be sufficient to ensure co-ordination that is as close and smooth as needed. Fourth, the question as to whether a specific bankruptcy regime for banks is needed remains an important issue. ...|$|R

The institution building of the CMIM secretariat will accelerate the establishment of a regional monetary institution, e. g. an Asian Monetary Fund.

40|$|This report {{explains}} how {{differences in the}} informational and contracting environments of individual countries affect the optimal design of their <b>financial</b> <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> and their optimal strategies for managing financial crises. Its purpose is to explain how to design and operate <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> at minimum cost to taxpayers and well-managed banks in countries whose informational and contracting technologies differ. The basic premise is that optimal regulation is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. By showing that large differences exist across countries in the transparency and deterrency that banks afford their depositors, the paper highlights why safetynet design must allow for differences in the enforceability of private contracts. The evolution of a country’s <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> depends {{on the ability of}} the private and public sectors to value banks, discipline risk-taking, and resolve financial difficulties promptly. Political accountability is needed to assure that the public portions of these tasks evolve effectively and efficiently. Optimal financial regulation is not a one-size-fits-all proposition.
