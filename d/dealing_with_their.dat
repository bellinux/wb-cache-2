5|$|It was the Ottomans' {{skill with}} <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> opponents {{that made them}} very {{powerful}} very quickly. They would subjugate their opponents as vassals rather than destroy them, otherwise they would have exhausted themselves in the process. The exacting of tribute from conquered states {{in the form of}} children and money was effective in forcing subjugation over conquest. Coupled with this, the entire region was composed of many states (Bulgaria, Serbia, Latin states) who would just as soon fight each other as the Ottomans and realized too late that the Ottoman forces defeated them by integrating them in a network of subordinate states.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of Ahhiyawa in western Anatolia is mentioned in various Hittite accounts from c. 1400 to c. 1220 BC. Ahhiyawa is generally {{accepted as a}} Hittite translation of Mycenaean Greece (Achaeans in Homeric Greek), but a precise geographical {{definition of the term}} cannot be drawn from the texts. During this time, the kings of Ahhiyawa were evidently capable of <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> Hittite counterparts both on a diplomatic and military level. Moreover, Ahhiyawan activity was to interfere in Anatolian affairs, with the support of anti-Hittite uprisings or through local vassal rulers, which the Ahhiyawan king used as agents for the extension of his influence.|$|E

5|$|While the British were <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> rebellious colonists {{along the}} Atlantic coast, the Spanish entered {{the war in}} 1779 as an ally of France. They took the {{opportunity}} to order Bernardo de Galvez, Governor of Louisiana, on an expedition east to retake West Florida. He captured Mobile during the Battle of Fort Charlotte in 1780, as part of this campaign. The Spanish wished to eliminate any British threat to their Louisiana colony west of the Mississippi River, which they had received from France in the 1763 Treaty of Paris. Their actions were condoned by the revolting American colonies, partially evidenced by the presence of Oliver Pollack, representative of the American Continental Congress. Due to strong trade ties, many residents of Mobile and West Florida remained loyal to the British Crown. The Spanish renamed the fort as Fortaleza Carlota, and held Mobile as a part of Spanish West Florida until 1813, when it was seized by United States General James Wilkinson during the War of 1812.|$|E

25|$|Though earlier {{approaches}} to translation are less commonly used today, they retain importance when <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> products, as when historians view ancient or medieval records {{to piece together}} events {{which took place in}} non-Western or pre-Western environments.

25|$|A conic {{section is}} a curve {{that results from}} the {{intersection}} of a cone with a plane. There are three primary types of conic sections: ellipses (including circles), parabolas, and hyperbolas. The conic sections are reputed to have been discovered by Menaechmus (c. 380BCE– c. 320BCE) and since dealing with conic sections is equivalent to <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> respective equations, they played geometric roles equivalent to cubic equations and other higher order equations.|$|E

25|$|During this period, {{organization}} developed {{branches in}} non exclusively Greece, Cyprus, Syria, Russia. It was effectively {{working in a}} wide range of countries and able to effect the local policies. The organization became a case of transnational ethnic nationalism. Well-publicized hunger strikes and protest marches in Germany were examples of actions by the trans-nationalized movement. Germany was faced with the challenge of developing policies <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> Kurdish residents as well as towards Turkey. In 1993, the organization was banned in Germany.|$|E
25|$|Weber {{demonstrated}} rationalization in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, {{in which}} the aims of certain Protestant Theologies, particularly Calvinism, are shown to have shifted towards rational means of economic gain {{as a way of}} <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> 'salvation anxiety'. The rational consequences of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with its religious roots, and so the latter were eventually discarded. Weber continues his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy and on the classifications of authority. In these works he alludes to an inevitable move towards rationalization.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} into {{maturity of}} classical liberalism took place {{before and after}} the French Revolution in Britain. Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics, at least until the publication of J. S. Mill's Principles in 1848. Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth, and the policies the state should follow in order to maximise wealth. And the radical liberal movement began in the 1790s in England and concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasizing natural rights and popular sovereignty. Radicals like Richard Price and Joseph Priestley saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> many grievances, including the treatment of Protestant Dissenters, the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.|$|E
