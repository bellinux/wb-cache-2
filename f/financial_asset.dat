5|$|The {{effect of}} declining {{interest}} rates, combined with excess liquidity continually {{provided by the}} ECB, {{made it easier for}} banks within the countries in which interest rates fell the most, and their linked sovereigns, to borrow significant amounts (above the 3% of GDP budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially) and significantly inflate their public and private debt levels. Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure of the banking system when underlying hard or <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so near worthless there was no liquid market for them. This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing government bond interest rates, producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|E

25|$|When {{there is}} an {{increased}} demand for base money, the central bank must act if it wishes to maintain the short-term interest rate. It does this by increasing the supply of base money: {{it goes to the}} open market to buy a <b>financial</b> <b>asset,</b> such as government bonds. To pay for these assets, new central bank money is generated in the seller's loro account, increasing the total amount of base money in the economy. Conversely, if the central bank sells these assets in the open market, the base money is reduced.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a typical}} case, the [...] {{variables}} might be: a balance (the real or nominal {{value of a}} debt or a <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> in terms of monetary units), a periodic rate of interest, the number of periods, {{and a series of}} cash flows. (In the case of a debt, cash flows are payments against principal and interest; {{in the case of a}} <b>financial</b> <b>asset,</b> these are contributions to or withdrawals from the balance.) [...] More generally, the cash flows may not be periodic but may be specified individually. [...] Any of the variables may be the independent variable (the sought-for answer) in a given problem. [...] For example, one may know that: the interest is 0.5% per period (per month, say); the number of periods is 60 (months); the initial balance (of the debt, in this case) is 25,000 units; and the final balance is 0 units.

2500|$|In finance, {{arbitrage}} pricing theory (APT) is {{a general}} theory of asset pricing that holds that the expected return of a <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> can be modeled as a linear function of various macro-economic factors or theoretical market indices, where sensitivity to changes in each factor is represented by a factor-specific beta coefficient. The model-derived rate of return will then be used to price the asset correctly—the asset price should equal the expected end of period price discounted at the rate implied by the model. If the price diverges, arbitrage should bring it back into line.|$|E

2500|$|All {{sorts of}} {{differences}} occur in valuation practices used by business (historic cost, current replacement value, current sale value etc.) affecting fair value and GAAP-based accounting (among many other issues, if {{the profitability of}} a capital asset falls, {{the market value of}} the capital asset itself will fall as well, in response – irrespective of whether it is a physical asset or a <b>financial</b> <b>asset,</b> and irrespective of its acquisition cost; this reduces the fall of the profit rate). The valuations made are themselves influenced by the way price inflation is actually calculated using price indexes. Jochen Hartwig found that the divergence in growth rates of real GDP between the U.S. and the EU since 1997 [...] "can be explained almost entirely in terms of changes to deflation methods that have been introduced in the U.S. after 1997, but not – or only to a very limited extent – in Europe".

2500|$|Another {{common theme}} is the {{proposed}} intention {{to create a}} system of more fair and equitable tax collection. The Automated Payment Transaction tax (APT tax) taxes the broadest possible tax base, namely all transactions including all real and <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> transactions. Instead of introducing progressivity through the tax rate structure, the flat rate APT tax introduces progressiveness through the tax base since the highest income and wealth groups undertake {{a disproportionate share of}} financial transactions. In the context of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, many economists, governments, and organizations around the world re-examined, or were asked to re-examine, the concept of a financial transaction tax, or its various forms. In response to a request from the G20 nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) delivered a report in 2010 titled [...] "A Fair and Substantial Contribution by the Financial Sector" [...] which made reference to a financial transaction tax as one of several options.|$|E

These papers have concentrated their focus on {{foreign exchange rate risk}} as "the problem" with respect to foreign investments, and therefore they sought solutions from traditional hedging tools such as leverage, options, forward contracts and even currency swaps. This study considers differences among countries in national income tax rates as a plausible explanation for the interest in foreign real estate investment. Hypothetically, it may be possible for investors to move a portion of their wealth to a foreign country and take advantage of lower marginal tax rates. After-tax returns from mixed-asset portfolios consisting of (1) domestic <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> only, (2) domestic <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> plus foreign <b>financial</b> <b>assets,</b> and (3) domestic <b>financial</b> <b>assets,</b> foreign <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> and foreign real estate are evaluated.
