40|$|Sub-sea {{pipelines}} {{represent the}} most cost {{effective way of}} transporting oil & gas from the sub-sea field to the market. S-lay is the dominant installation method due to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>firing</b> line enabling several welding stations and efficient pipe string production. For S-lay, a stinger is used to support the pipe until it is lowered into the sea. For this method, pipeline installation {{is limited by the}} weather window and primarily due to the motions induced at the stinger tip by 1 st order wave forces on the vessel. These motions will cause the pipeline to accumulate fatigue damage. This is especially the case when the lay vessel is forced to wait for whatever reason. The pipe will then have to be abandoned to avoid too much damage on the pipeline. The guideline for the allowed damage is no more than 10 % of the total fatigue life, for the installation phase. This thesis will focus on the fatigue crack growth of the weld at the stinger tip section. And calculate the period of time it takes for the pipeline to reach the allowed damage criterion. The analysis and calculations presented in this thesis will be based on the computer codes SIMLA and LINKpipe. A brief introduction to these codes will be presented. SIMLA will simulate the sea state and the vessel motion, to produce the cyclic bending stresses. These stresses are imported into LINKpipe, which will perform the fatigue calculations. The sea states chosen for the analyses, were chosen based on the JONSWAP spectrum for the HS chosen. The periods were chosen to give a wide view of how the fatigue would develop as the period changedThe conclusion drawn from the results are that the fatigue life consumption is closely related to the RAO of the vessel. The method presented gives a good basis for the fatigue calculation of a pipeline being installed. The shortest time to failure was seen {{in the case of the}} 13 seconds period.

They were first called galiote à bombe (a word derived from the Dutch galliot, denoting a short, beamy vessel well suited for the powerful downward recoil of its weapons). Five such vessels were used to shell Algiers in 1682 destroying the land forts, and killing some 700 defenders. Two years later the French repeated their success at Genoa. The early French bomb vessels had two forward-pointing mortars fixed side-by-side on the foredeck. To aim these weapons, the entire ship was rotated by letting out or pulling in a spring anchor.

Fuel quality {{is an important}} parameter determining forest fire behavior, which differs among both tree species and organs. Fuel quality is not static: when dead plant material decomposes, its structural, chemical, and water dynamic properties change, with implications for fuel flammability.

This study aimed to determine decomposition’s effects on fuel quality and how this directly and indirectly affects wood flammability. We did controlled experiments on water dynamics and fire using twigs of four temperate tree species. We found considerable direct and indirect effects of decomposition on twig flammability, particularly on ignitability and burning time, which are important variables for fire spread. More decomposed twigs ignite and burn faster at given water content. Moreover, decomposed twigs dry out faster than fresh twigs, which make them flammable sooner when drying out after rain.
