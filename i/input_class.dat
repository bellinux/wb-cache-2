Sea Cucumber (SC) is a synthesizing {{compiler}} for FPGAs that accepts Java class files as input (generated from Java source files) {{and that}} generates circuits that exploit the coarse- and fine-grained parallelism {{available in the}} <b>input</b> <b>class</b> files. Programmers determine the level of coarse-grained parallelism available by organizing their circuit {{as a set of}} inter-communicating, concurrent threads (using standard Java threads) that are implemented by SC as concurrent hardware. SC automatically extracts fine-grained parallelism from the body of each thread by processing the byte codes contained in the <b>input</b> <b>class</b> files and employs conventional compiler optimizations such as data-flow and controlflow graph analysis, dead-code elimination, constant folding, operation simplification, predicated static single assignment, if-conversion, hyperblock formation, etc. The resulting EDIF files can be processed using Xilinx place and route software to produce bitstreams that can be downloaded into FPGAs for execution. ...|$|E

Working in a higher-order, {{abstract}} {{logic of}} events, wedefineevent classes, a generalization of interfaces, and propagation rules that specify information flow between event classes. We propose a general {{definition of a}} component as a scheme, parameterized {{by a set of}} <b>input</b> <b>classes,</b> that defines a set of output classes and propagation rules. The specification of a component is a relation between its <b>input</b> <b>classes</b> and defined output classes that follows from its propagation rules and definitions. We define a subset of programmable event classes that can be compiled and executed and a language, called E #, for specifying components. Components specified in E # preserve programmability–if the component’s <b>input</b> <b>classes</b> are programmable then its output classes and propagation rules are programmable. Thus a component specified in E # is a higher-order object: given programs for its <b>input</b> <b>classes,</b> it produces a distributed program for propagating information and programs for its output classes. These programs can be passed as inputs to other components so that components can be composed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Finite model {{reasoning}} in UML class diagrams, e. g., checking whether a class {{is forced to}} have either zero or infinitely many objects, is of crucial importance for assessing quality of the analysis phase in software development. Despite the fact that finite model reasoning is often considered more important than unrestricted reasoning, no implementation of the former task has been attempted so far. The main result {{of this paper is}} {{that it is possible to}} use off-the-shelf tools for constraint modeling and programming for obtaining a finite model reasoner. In particular, exploiting appropriate reasoning techniques, we propose an encoding as a CSP of UML class diagram satisfiability. Moreover, we show also how CP can be used to actually return a finite model of a class diagram. A description of our system, which accepts as <b>input</b> <b>class</b> diagrams in the MOF syntax, and the results of the experimentation performed on the CIM knowledge base are given. ...|$|E

30|$|Large row {{separation}} {{allows the}} synthesized vectors to differ somewhat {{from the actual}} target vectors without losing the discrimination between different classes. The reasoning for large column separation follows {{from the fact that}} each column in the target matrix can be seen as an individual binary classification task (between the classes having a value 1 and the classes having a value − 1 in a specific column). Because of the varying similarity between two arbitrary audio classes, some of such binary classifications are likely to become much easier than others. Hence, as the same target vectors are nonetheless applied to any given <b>input</b> <b>classes,</b> it is also beneficial to keep the binary classification tasks as different as possible by maximizing the column separation.|$|R
