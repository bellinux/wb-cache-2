50|$|Reviews for Human Resource Machine were {{generally}} positive, crediting {{the game for}} being able to distill the complexities of assembly programming into an easily understood visual metaphor. Angus Morrison of PC Gamer rated the game 75 out of 100, considered the puzzle progression to be strong and taught important programming concepts though would have appreciated more instruction on some of the advanced approaches; Morrison also felt the setting and story of the game was under utilized. Laura Kate Dale of Destructoid, giving the game a 6 out of 10, also found the lack of instructional material for advanced concepts {{in the second half of}} the game to be troublesome, and felt that the game didn't fully commit to either being a good <b>instructional</b> <b>game</b> for new programmers or a difficult challenge for advanced ones. Laura Hudson of Boing Boing believed the game's approach to programming and its visual style, matching that of Little Inferno, helps to avoid scaring off would-be players, and that some of the puzzles were designed to help make the player feel smart after completing them.|$|E
40|$|Current {{approaches}} {{to the design of}} games for learning can be roughly divided into two main camps: one claiming that commercial games already employ many strategies that are valuable in the design of <b>instructional</b> <b>games</b> and that formal instructional design methodologies are not needed, while the other argues that the design of <b>instructional</b> <b>games</b> must apply traditional practices in formal ways and that games designers must yield to the better-informed professional instructional designer.

30|$|A {{good and}} {{effective}} educational game should combine good learning content and game design (Oblinger, 2006; Amory and Seagram, 2003). Prensky (2001) recommended {{that a good}} educational game design should combine a balanced amount of both fun and educational value. Koster (2004) stated that game design {{is not an easy}} task since it is not a precise science. Also, not understanding the learning process within games can affect implementing a structured <b>instructional</b> <b>game</b> design (Egenfeldt-Nielsen, 2005). Furthermore, Plass et al. (2011) listed three elements that should be present while designing an educational game, namely game element which describes the game play activity, learning element which describes the activities that are known with their learning objective and assessment element which describes high level activities that aim to assess learners.|$|E
30|$|A vital {{element in}} {{achieving}} learning goals {{is the relationship}} between motivational processing and the outcome processing (satisfaction), especially in an online <b>instructional</b> <b>game,</b> as seen in the experiment carried out by Huang et al. (2010). There seems to be a significant relation between these two variables, which suggests that designers of DGBL need to consider extrinsic rewards to achieve motivational development and satisfaction. Learning satisfaction is strongly correlated with student motivation and attitude towards GBL before the game, with actual enjoyment and effort during the game, {{as well as with the}} quality of the teacher/facilitator (Mayer, 2013). Specifically, students with a higher level of inner motivation and positive attitude towards GBL are more likely to have higher learning expectations, and to experience more satisfaction in their GBL participation.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to examine the effects of student’s gaming {{behaviors}} and perceptions of games on the engagement in the mathematics classrooms. For the study, the research team recruited 299 sixth grade students from two schools located in rural areas of Virginia in the United States and collected data. For the analytical tool, we employed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to examine the relationship of gaming behaviors with the engagement mediated by perceptions of <b>instructional</b> <b>games.</b> We found that student’s mathematics engagement was associated with student’s perceptions of games and gaming behaviors. The game hours drew a significant path to student’s perceptions of game learning while the game frequencies had a significant path to student’s perceptions of game utility.

Therefore, a total of thirty students of Year 3 from a primary school in Kluang were selected as respondents. The instruments used in this research are questionnaire and a set of <b>instructional</b> video <b>games.</b> The items in questionnaire are related to investigate about students’ attitude and meaningful learning process towards learning using video games. A pilot test was carried out to six respondents from different year 3 classes from the school with Cronbach’s Alpha Reliability Coefficient value at 0. 869 which is a high level of reliability. Results obtained from the questionnaire support the proof that <b>instructional</b> video <b>games</b> does have positive effect towards students’ attitude and meaningful learning process.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates pre-service teachers’ {{experience}} about playing technology games and their opinions about using contemporary technology to play <b>games</b> as an <b>instructional</b> tool. The participants are 272 pre-service teachers from {{a university in}} Middle Anatolia. The present study used mixed methods. The data was collected through an online survey that {{was created by the}} authors. The survey contains demographic questions about the participants` gender, major, whether they play technology games or not, and questions about which technology games they play, their opinions about using technology (IWBs and tablets) to play games for instruction, and for which instructional purposes they plan using technology to play games. Following research questions were investigated for the current study: 1. Whether pre-service teachers play technology games or not? If yes, which technology games they play? 2. Whether pre-service teachers plan to use interactive white boards and tablets that were distributed by the government under FATIH project to play technology games for educational purposes? 3. Whether pre-teachers’ opinions about using the IWBs and tablets to play <b>instructional</b> <b>games</b> associated with their gender and playing technology games? 4. For which instructional purposes pre-service teachers plan to use IWBs and tablets to play <b>instructional</b> <b>games?</b> For the second and third questions descriptive statistics and crosstabs were conducted. For the first and fourth questions content analysis was applied. Fifty-four percent (n= 148) of the pre-service teachers agreed to use the IWBs and tablets to play technology games for educational purposes while 46 % (n= 124) did not. There is no statistically significant association between gender and plans using the IWBs and tablets to play <b>instructional</b> <b>games.</b> There was a statistically significant association between who Playing Technology Games and Plans Using IWBs and Tablets to Play <b>Instructional</b> <b>Games.</b> Pre-service teachers who play technology games reported higher scores than the ones who do not play technology games.

40|$|The {{artifacts}} (<b>instructional</b> <b>games)</b> {{created by}} a class of fourth-grade students engaged in designing educational games are analyzed. To facilitate the analysis, these artifacts were compared with products created by students in a similar design context who were creating instructional software. In both situations, inner-city fourth graders were asked to create products in Logo to teach third graders about fractions. Of the 32 products created, 16 were <b>instructional</b> <b>games.</b> Evaluation of the development process indicated that both <b>instructional</b> and <b>game</b> designers improved their understandings of Logo and their own knowledge of fractions. Analysis of the project demonstrated that the given design task {{made a difference in}} terms of the product and process {{and in terms of the}} learning experience. Instructional software designers used Logo code to create fraction representations, but game designers usually preferred to use modified geometric shapes. Game designers tended to place the game in the foreground; software designers made fractions central. Game designers also preferred active manipulation and animated scenes. For these students, the openness of the design task varied according to the task specifications. (Contains 16 figures representing computer screens and 17 references.)

Also, there students’ prior knowledge and intrinsic motivation affected each other; that is, a group low in intrinsic motivation but with higher prior knowledge showed comparatively higher student achievements. These findings suggest that students’ prior knowledge should also be considered while designing and adopting game-based learning in order to engage students with different levels of intrinsic motivation...|$|E
40|$|Instructional {{games have}} become an {{established}} factor in corporate and government training, and {{they are beginning to}} appear to a greater extent in educational institutions. As a result, courses on <b>instructional</b> <b>game</b> development are being incorporated into educational programs.

This article reports the practice and result of using games in one such course, and uses student commentary to support the conclusion that the games used were successful in reducing anxiety, increasing motivation, and improving understanding. In training and education, technology-based games and simulations are now popular and becoming more so, but thinking of games and simulations as learning tools has a long history in the literature (Cameron & Dwyer, 2005; Dekkers & Donath 1981; Fraas, 1980; Saunders, 1997) and an even longer one in common knowledge.

40|$|The {{potential}} of video games for learning is now widely accepted among {{the community of}} Educational Technology. However, there is a critical lack of guidance {{for the design of}} educational games. In order to provide such guidance, {{there is a need for}} a solid theoretical basis regarding the nature of learning in games. This paper redefines what a game is, in semiotic terms, enabling four groups of strategies to be formally identified, depending on how the knowledge to be acquired is inserted into the game. These four groups are: systemic learning, when knowledge is embedded in the game mechanics; winner strategies, when the game provides an environment in which knowledge is required to reach the game's goal; loose coupling, when knowledge is arbitrary required to unblock the progression towards the game's goal; and contextual coupling, in which the game serves as a context for the exposition of static learning material. This theory is then put into practice by analyzing three commercial educational games. It constitutes a first step towards <b>Instructional</b> <b>Game</b> Design...|$|E
