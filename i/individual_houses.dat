Construction of Davison came during a period of rapid dorm-building spanning 1893–1902 during which the older seminary-style model of housing—a single large hall in which all a college's residents lived, in Vassar's case Main Building—was quickly waning in popularity in favor of smaller <b>individual</b> <b>houses.</b> The project began with the opening of Strong House in 1893 and continued with Raymond House in 1897, Lathrop House in 1901, and finally Davison in 1902.|$|E

These local units were crucial in warning, diversion and delay of GVN or US forces if the Main Force element came under attack. Communist forces generally avoided villages with high canal banks, graveyards or trees because such obstacles hindered observation and gave advancing US and ARVN troops cover. Mines and booby traps were also planted along likely avenues of approach.|$|E

25|$|Moscow of 1885 had no {{sanitation}} and {{no water}} supply network in present sense: water flowed from Mytishchi {{in the open}} trench of the Rostokino Aqueduct and was distributed to {{a limited number of}} fountains on the central squares. In the 1870s the city built three local water networks of inadequate capacity that were abandoned by 1885. After long disputes between supporters of municipal and private water supply, in 1888 the city settled on building a single pressurized water system. Key element of the system – two tower-like water reservoirs near present-day Rizhsky Rail Terminal – were partially financed with Alekseyev's personal funds. The main distribution pipeline, 108 versts long, was completed during Alekseyev's tenure in 1892.

500|$|Contemporary housing {{developments}} included the southeast side of Upper Lewes Road, {{the west side}} of Lewes Road, and a series of impressive semi-detached villas on Ditchling Road, but Round Hill's most intensive period of growth began in the mid-1860s. [...] "Fine curving terraces of Regency-style houses" [...] appeared on the newly built Roundhill Crescent, which curved away from the northwest side of Upper Lewes Road, and semi-detached houses were laid out on Richmond Road behind and at a higher level. The first parts of Roundhill Crescent, still with a post-Regency character despite their late date, were built in 1865. Further development of the middle-class houses on these roads was patchy—many gaps still existed in 1875— but lower-class terraced housing spread rapidly elsewhere. [...] Vicar of Brighton Rev. Arthur Wagner bought {{the northern part of the}} former Pleasure Gardens—still open land in 1860—and stipulated that houses costing no more than £120 should be built for Brighton's working-class population. [...] He lent money to builders to increase the pace of development. The tightly packed terraced streets between Upper Lewes Road and Lewes Road were mostly complete by the 1870s, and St Martin's Church was built nearby to serve the area. Larger <b>individual</b> <b>houses</b> of the 1860s included Prince's Villa, in an isolated position next to Tower Mill, and Bryn—built in 1869 on Wakefield Road and used as an orphanage from 1875 until 1937.|$|E
500|$|The central {{square in}} Covent Garden is simply called [...] "Covent Garden", often marketed as [...] "Covent Garden Piazza" [...] to {{distinguish}} it from the eponymous surrounding area. Designed and laid out in 1630, {{it was the first}} modern square in London—originally a flat, open space or piazza with low railings. A casual market started on the south side, and by 1830 the present market hall had been built. The space is popular with street performers, who audition with the site's owners for an allocated slot. The square was originally laid out when the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell, commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to Westminster Abbey. Jones's design was informed by his knowledge of modern town planning in Europe, particularly Piazza d'Arme, in Leghorn, Tuscany, Piazza San Marco in Venice, Piazza Santissima Annunziata in Florence, and the Place des Vosges in Paris. The centrepiece of the project was the large square, the concept of which was new to London, and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew, acting as the prototype for the design of new estates, such as the Ladbroke Estate and the Grosvenor Estate. Isaac de Caus, the French Huguenot architect, designed the <b>individual</b> <b>houses</b> under Jones's overall design.|$|E
500|$|These sixteen houses {{form the}} greater part of the square's west side. [...] Although there are {{differences}} in height and detail between <b>individual</b> <b>houses,</b> they were designed {{at the same time and}} maintain [...] "the longstanding tradition of the terraced townhouse" [...] which had been developed [...] "by Henry Holland [...] in his own speculative enterprises at Hans Town and Sloane Street, London". [...] Numbers 7, 8, 11 and 15 are entirely stuccoed; number 18 retains its original unpainted yellow-brick upper façade; and all other houses have painted brick to their upper storeys and stuccoed ground floors with rustication. [...] The roofs are mansard-style and laid with slate. [...] Each house has dormer windows; numbers 5–13 inclusive rise to four storeys, while the other seven houses are one storey shorter. [...] All houses except number 12 have a single bay window, mostly in tripartite form. [...] Number 12 has three windows to each floor. [...] The entrance porches, reached via staircases, are either Doric or Ionic in form, with columns and entablatures. [...] They have arch-headed doorways set into them. [...] Small cast-iron balconies run across the terrace at first-floor level (although number 5's has been lost), and some houses have canopy-style verandahs as well. [...] A nearly continuous cornice (absent on numbers 13 and 19) spans the terrace; some houses also have a second cornice above this. [...] Several houses have fanlights with coloured glass, and other non-standard details include decorative stucco panelling at number 5; paterae (circular motifs), triglyph-decorated friezes and other Classical-style ornamentation in some of the porch entablatures; original window-guards of iron; a blocked doorway flanked by pilasters at number 20; and many original sash windows.|$|E
