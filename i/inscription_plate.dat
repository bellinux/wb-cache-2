50|$|The {{monument}} imitates {{the more}} famous tomb of Giovanni Garzia Mellini {{on the left}} side of the chapel. The centrepiece is the marble bust of the Cardinal in a similar pose than his counterpart opposite. He looks toward the altar holding a book and a biretta. His head is covered by a zucchetto. The bust is placed in a deep rectangular niche which is clad with black and yellow slabs. The characteristically colourful Late Baroque composition is enhanced by a yellow marble <b>inscription</b> <b>plate.</b> The monument is crowned by a broken segmental pediment with the cardinal's coloured coat-of-arms. The French sculptor signed his work on the biretta of the bust: MONNO(T) F(E)CIT.|$|E

50|$|Minor {{variations}} on the first state exist with different wording in the titles and inscription. The second state, the only known variation {{in the composition of}} the picture itself, is incomplete. The King's Arms have been removed and replaced by eight heads, in two subject groups, one showing character portrait and the other caricatures of the same figures. According to the addition made to the <b>inscription</b> <b>plate</b> by John Ireland, Hogarth started the alterations during October 1764, and was still working on them up to his death on 26 October 1764. Bathurst's appears again among these heads: his character portrait is reproduced to the far right in the character group, and a caricature appears in the same position in the caricature group. The other three figures in the two groups show two men looking eagerly at third, in poses reminiscent of the Cartoons of Raphael that Hogarth had used in Character and Caricatura.|$|E
