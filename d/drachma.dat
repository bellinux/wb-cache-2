5|$|The {{procedure}} used to fix {{the conversion}} rate between the Greek <b>drachma</b> and the euro was different, since the euro by then was already two years old. While the conversion rates for the initial eleven currencies were determined only hours before the euro was introduced, the conversion rate for the Greek <b>drachma</b> was fixed several months beforehand.|$|E
5|$|Prostitutes {{were often}} {{hired by the}} hosts of symposia as {{entertainment}} for guests, as seen in red-figure vase paintings. Prostitutes were also drawn on drinking cups as pinups for male entertainment. Dancing girls and musicians entertaining at symposia might have been sexually assaulted; in Aristophanes' comedy Thesmophoriazusae, a dancing girl is treated as a prostitute and Euripides charges a guard one <b>drachma</b> {{to have sex with}} her.|$|E
5|$|Usually made of silver, the Greek <b>drachma</b> coin, {{including}} the tetradrachm, was the standard currency {{used throughout the}} Parthian Empire. The Arsacids maintained royal mints at the cities of Hecatompylos, Seleucia, and Ecbatana. They most likely operated a mint at Mithridatkert/Nisa as well. From the empire's inception until its collapse, drachmas produced throughout the Parthian period rarely weighed less than 3.5g or more than 4.2g. The first Parthian tetradrachms, weighing in principle around 16g with some variation, appear after Mithridates I conquered Mesopotamia and were minted exclusively at Seleucia.|$|E
50|$|An Attic {{talent was}} the {{equivalent}} of 60 minae or 6,000 <b>drachmae.</b> There were 6,000 <b>drachmae</b> in an Attic talent.|$|R
50|$|According to the Decree of 11 October 1835, the Phalanx was to {{be divided}} into tetrarchies (τετραρχίαι, sing. τετραρχία), each {{commanded}} by a captain as commander or tetrarch (τετράρχης), one lieutenant, two sub-lieutenants, one ensign, four master sergeants, 54 corporals and ordinary phalangites, and one trumpeteer. The ranks in the Phalanx corresponded to higher officer ranks in the Army, with a captain corresponding to colonel and a monthly pay of 250 to 300 <b>drachmas,</b> a lieutenant (180 <b>drachmas)</b> corresponding to lieutenant colonel, a sub-lieutenant (140 <b>drachmas)</b> to major, an ensign or master sergeant (90 <b>drachmas)</b> to captain, a corporal (60 <b>drachmas)</b> to lieutenant, and an ordinary phalangite (48 <b>drachmas)</b> to sub-lieutenant. The poorer lower ranks also {{had the right to}} additional free flour and free lodgings for their use when serving off base, as well as free healthcare.|$|R
25|$|He was {{depicted}} {{on the reverse}} of the Greek 20 <b>drachmas</b> coin of 1990-2001. A 50 <b>drachmas</b> commemorative coin was issued in 1998 for the 200th anniversary of his birth.|$|R
5|$|With no army left {{to defend}} Tigranocerta, and a foreign populace that gleefully opened the gates to the Romans, Lucullus' army began the {{wholesale}} looting and plunder of the city. The city was literally deconstructed piece by piece. The king's treasury, {{estimated to be}} worth 8,000 talents, was looted and each soldier in the army was awarded 800 <b>drachma.</b> The battle also resulted in severe territorial losses: most of the lands in Tigranes' empire {{to the south of}} the Taurus fell under the sway of Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known coins of the Western {{world were}} minted {{in the kingdom}} of Lydia in Asia Minor around 600 BC. The coins of Lydia were made of electrum, which is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, that was available within the territory of Lydia. Since that time, silver standards, in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver, have been widespread throughout the world until the 20th century. Notable silver coins through the centuries include the Greek <b>drachma,</b> the Roman denarius, the Islamic dirham, the Indian rupee {{from the time of the}} Mughal Empire (grouped with copper and gold coins to create a trimetallic standard), and the Spanish dollar.|$|E
5|$|The {{price of}} slaves varied in {{accordance}} with their ability. Xenophon valued a Laurion miner at 180 drachmas; while a workman at major works was paid one <b>drachma</b> per day. Demosthenes' father's cutlers were valued at 500 to 600 drachmas each. Price was also a function of the quantity of slaves available; in the 4th century BC they were abundant and it was thus a buyer's market. A tax on sale revenues was levied by the market cities. For instance, a large helot market was organized during the festivities at the temple of Apollo at Actium. The Acarnanian League, which {{was in charge of the}} logistics, received half of the tax proceeds, the other half going to the city of Anactorion, of which Actium was a part. Buyers enjoyed a guarantee against latent defects; the transaction could be invalidated if the bought slave turned out to be crippled and the buyer had not been warned about it.|$|E
50|$|The silver stater minted at Corinth of 8.6 g {{weight was}} divided into three silver <b>drachmae</b> of 2.9 g, but was often linked to the Athenian silver didrachm (two <b>drachmae)</b> {{weighing}} 8.6 g. In comparison, the Athenian silver tetradrachm (four <b>drachmae)</b> weighed 17.2 g. Staters were also struck in several Greek city-states such as, Aegina, Aspendos, Delphi, Knossos, Kydonia, many city-states of Ionia, Lampsacus, Megalopolis, Metapontium, Olympia, Phaistos, Poseidonia, Syracuse, Thasos, Thebes and more.|$|R
25|$|The first {{issues of}} {{banknotes}} were in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 <b>drachmae,</b> soon followed by 100, 500 and 1000 <b>drachmae</b> by 1956. 5000-drachma notes {{were introduced in}} 1984, followed by 10,000-drachma notes in 1995 and 200-drachma notes in 1997.|$|R
50|$|Solon also {{altered the}} {{standard}} of coinage of weights and measures, by introducing the Euboic standard {{in place of the}} Pheidonian or Aeginetan standard. 100 new <b>drachmae</b> were thus made to contain the same amount of silver as 73 old <b>drachmae.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>drachma</b> was reintroduced in May 1832, {{shortly before}} the {{establishment}} of the modern state of Greece (with the exception of the subdivision Taurus). It replaced the phoenix at par. The <b>drachma</b> was subdivided into 100 lepta.|$|E
25|$|When Greece finally {{achieved}} {{its independence}} from the Ottoman Empire in 1828, the phoenix was introduced as the monetary unit; its use was short-lived, however, and in 1832 the phoenix {{was replaced by the}} <b>drachma,</b> adorned with the image of King Otto of Greece, who reigned as modern Greece’s first king from 1832 to 1862. The <b>drachma</b> was divided into 100 lepta. In 2002 the <b>drachma</b> ceased to be legal tender after the euro, the monetary unit of the European Union, became Greece’s sole currency.|$|E

50|$|In Roman Egypt, {{where the}} best {{documentation}} on pricing has survived, {{the price of a}} measure of wheat was 200 <b>drachmae</b> in 276 AD, and increased to more than 2,000,000 <b>drachmae</b> in 334 AD, roughly 1,000,000% inflation in a span of 58 years.|$|R
50|$|The {{document}} {{was written by}} Chaeremon, son of Theon, and Nicanor, who had received 168 <b>drachmae</b> from Archias. This was the balance due on a loan of 700 <b>drachmae</b> made by Chaeremon four years before. The measurements of the fragment are 115 by 100 mm.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of anecdotes about her. For example, it was said Demosthenes was willing to pay 1,000 Greek <b>drachmas</b> for a night with her, but she raised her price to 10,000 <b>drachmas</b> after viewing him, while she gave herself to Diogenes for nothing.|$|R
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate comparative exchange rates with modern currency because the range of products produced by economies of centuries gone by were different from today, which makes purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations very difficult; however, some historians and economists have estimated that in the 5th century BC a <b>drachma</b> had a rough value of 25 U.S. dollars (in the year 1990 – equivalent to 46.50 USD in 2015), whereas classical historians regularly {{say that in the}} heyday of ancient Greece (the fifth and fourth centuries) the daily wage for a skilled worker or a hoplite was one <b>drachma,</b> and for a heliast (juror) half a <b>drachma</b> since 425BC.|$|E
25|$|Between 1926 and 1930, a new coinage was {{introduced}} {{for the new}} Hellenic Republic, consisting of cupro-nickel coins in denominations of 20 lepta, 50 lepta, 1 <b>drachma,</b> and 2 drachmae; nickel coins of 5 drachmae; and silver coins of 10 and 20 drachmae. These were the last coins issued for the first modern <b>drachma,</b> and none were issued for the second.|$|E
25|$|In ancient times, the {{reputation}} of a wine depended on the region the wine came from rather than an individual producer or vineyard. In the 4th century BC, the most expensive wine sold in the local agora in Athens was that from Chios, which sold for between {{a quarter of a}} <b>drachma</b> and 2 <b>drachma</b> for a chous worth—about the equivalent of four standard 750 ml wine bottles today.|$|E
50|$|In 167 BC Rome {{forcibly}} made Delos a 'duty free' port {{to undercut}} the power and wealth of Rhodes, and Rhodian harbour-tax income dropped from 1 million <b>drachmas</b> to 150 000 <b>drachmas</b> in a year. Without its policing influence, piracy grew rampant even in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|R

25|$|Their tariffs are {{difficult}} to evaluate: they varied significantly. The average charge for a prostitute in 5th and 4th century ranged from three obols to a <b>drachma.</b> Expensive prostitutes could charge a stater (four drachmas), or more, like the Corinthian Lais in her prime did. In the 1st century BC, the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus of Gadara, cited in the Palatine anthology, V 126, mentions a system of subscription of up to five <b>drachma</b> for a dozen visits. In the 2nd century, Lucian in his Dialogue of the Hetaera has the prostitute Ampelis consider five <b>drachma</b> per visit as a mediocre price (8, 3). In the same text a young virgin can demand a Mina, that is 100 <b>drachma</b> (7,3), or even two minas if the customer is less than appetizing. A young and pretty prostitute could charge a higher price than her in-decline colleague; even if, as iconography on ceramics demonstrates, a specific market existed for older women. The price would change if the client demanded exclusivity. Intermediate arrangements also existed; {{a group of friends}} could purchase exclusivity, with each having part-time rights.|$|E

25|$|It was the {{standard}} unit of silver coinage at most ancient Greek mints, {{and the name}} obol was used to describe a coin that was one-sixth of a <b>drachma.</b> The notion that <b>drachma</b> derived from the word for fistful was recorded by Herakleides of Pontos (387–312BC) who was informed by the priests of Heraion that Pheidon, king of Argos, dedicated rod-shaped obeloi to Heraion. Similar information about Pheidon's obeloi was also recorded at the Parian Chronicle.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cost of the}} Phalanx, {{with the}} {{extensive}} privileges it afforded to its members, quickly became a major burden on {{the budget of the}} cash-strapped Greek state. By 1838, it comprised over 900 members, whose upkeep required over one million <b>drachmas</b> annually. In an attempt to reduce this exorbitant expenditure, on 1 January 1838, a new law proposed the award of land to members of the Phalanx with no other sources of income, provided that they renounced their previous salary. If they agreed, the members of the Phalanx were to receive a year's salary as capital and a promissory note for a value of public land, to be purchased at public auctions. The value of the land given was graded according to the salary, e.g. ordinary phalangites who received a pay of 48 <b>drachmas</b> were entitled to land worth 2,880 <b>drachmas,</b> those with a salary of 90 <b>drachmas</b> land worth 5,440 <b>drachmas,</b> and those with a salary of 140 <b>drachmas</b> and above land worth 8,400 <b>drachmas,</b> with the difference paid as salary. The lands thus acquired would be inalienable for three years without prior royal approval, but could be mortgaged. The members of this [...] "Endowed Phalanx" [...] (προικοδοτημένη φάλαγξ) maintained their privileges of rank and uniform, and were further eligible for appointments to the National Guard, while those who remained in the ordinary Phalanx faced curtailment of the privileges and pay, although it was possible to be transferred to the status of seniors (πρεσβύτες), which was reserved for particularly distinguished officers of the War of Independence [...] "in need of special assistance".|$|R
