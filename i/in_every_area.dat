5|$|Ireland's {{geologic}} history covers {{everything from}} volcanism and tropical seas {{to the last}} glacial period. Ireland was formed in two distinct parts and slowly joined together, uniting about 440 million years ago. As a result of tectonics {{and the effect of}} ice, the sea level has risen and fallen. <b>In</b> <b>every</b> <b>area</b> of the country the rocks which formed {{can be seen as a}} result. Finally, the impact of the glaciers shaped the landscape seen today. This variation in the two areas along with the differences between volcanic areas and shallow seas gives Ireland a range of soils as well. There are wide bogs and free-draining brown earths. The mountains are granite, sandstone, limestone with karst areas, and basalt formations.|$|E

25|$|Acknowledging {{that the}} changes in the {{national}} economy in the past two hundred years had transformed Congress' Commerce Clause power from being a marginal power that served mostly to mediate between the states by eliminating interstate tariffs and other burdens on interstate commerce into a general power that gave Congress essentially unlimited power to regulate <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>area</b> of economic life, O'Connor argued for special limitations on this power to protect the states' authority over their own employment relations. She invoked the limiting language of the most expansive interpretations of the Commerce Clause in the Court's decisions of the 1930s and 1940s to argue that the Court retained the power to decide whether a particular exercise of the Commerce Clause authority was necessary and proper to the federal purposes to be achieved. Applying that standard, she, joined by Justices Powell and Rehnquist, would find the FLSA unconstitutional as applied to employees of state and local governments.|$|E

500|$|A {{serious issue}} facing most {{southern}} schools in 1956 {{was that of}} desegregation.

[...] Here he outlined the history of the enrollment of blacks at LSU, which showed how resistant the university had been to such an undertaking. While there were avid segregationists who declared the federal desegregation laws would not be fulfilled, more practical minds could see the futility and extreme expense of having to create duplicate facilities <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>area</b> of advanced education, and the process of integration, which had already begun at a slow pace, now became accelerated.|$|E

500|$|Swivel {{dedicated}} {{much time}} in getting the vocal sound right, which according to him is crucial while working with Beyonc√©'s music. He further explained, [...] "I only put a quick EQ on the vocal {{at the end of}} a recording session if I have been cutting her, but mixing is far more particular, so I spent a lot of time dialling in the perfect frequency." [...] For the delay throws in the verses on [...] "I Care", he sent it through a large hall reverb at 50 percent ‚Äî half reverb, half clean ‚Äî then through an Amp Farm plug‚Äëin for the grittiness, and that then went through a quarter‚Äënote delay. In the bridge, √© matches the guitar solo vocally ‚Äî that was doubled ‚Äî and one of the vocal tracks has an Amp Farm on it to add to that grittiness. To do justice to the multitude of vocal tracks within the song, Swivel created a stereo field using some clever panning techniques and a Waves S1 Imager plug‚Äëin. He said that it was worth noting that whenever he mixes a record, [...] "I hate hard‚Äëpanned L/R. To get the right width, I pan them all differently in pairs: 40/40, 60/60, 70/70, 80/80, 90/90, and OK, maybe one is 100/100, but this process is ultimately what creates the stereo field." [...] Swivel used Waves' SSL E‚ÄëChannel plug‚Äëin to shape Beyonc√©'s lead vocal. He took a Waves S1 Imager and spread with that without isolating he width. He added that something is hard‚Äëpanned, it feels too isolated and also confuses the listener's ears. Swivel explained further, [...] "I like smooth sound, and with B that works fine as she‚Äôs so good at matching everything. I like a wall of background vocals. It's the best way of putting your vocal <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>area</b> of the stereo field: a wide sound, but you‚Äôve still got something there in the middle." ...|$|E
