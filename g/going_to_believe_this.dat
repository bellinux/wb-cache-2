5000|$|Howard here. You're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this,</b> and God help me if I'm wrong, but I {{think we}} can do the story. I found the gun. (p. 108) ...|$|E
5000|$|Warren: When I {{was there}} Vanderbilt {{we had some}} fine teams. There was Alf Sharp - he was an All-Southern center at one time. He looked like a badly formed pirate; he was really a menacing looking man. He was two years ahead of me, and then I taught his younger brother Sharp, who later taught at Vanderbilt. He was {{instrumental}} in founding the Department of Fine Arts, {{of which he was}} Chairman from 1955 to 1960 when brother came up one day and said, [...] "You're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this,</b> but I have documentation: my big brother was writing poems secretly the whole time he was here" [...] So I saw the poems years later when the younger brother betrayed him.Wood: Any good?Warren: Well, as a matter of fact, they were skillful. They were close imitations of Housman. Very skillfully done, totally unoriginal. But the man had this need, hidden under that murderous exterior, to write poems.|$|E
5000|$|Stranger Things Have Happened [...] {{received}} generally {{high praise}} from critics. Bruce Eder of AllMusic wrote [...] "No ones <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it, but <b>this</b> {{is a good}} album, from Peter Tork no less. Most of the songs are sung with passion and the voice {{is much better than}} it was on, say, Shades of Gray 28 years earlier. Whats more, Tork reveals himself as a solid rocker, starting from a folk idiom but working with lots of wattage on the instruments and no trace of wimpy singer/songwriter affectation in the playing. A few notable friends are aboard in addition to his direct collaborator and co-producer, James Lee Stanley—Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, Mackenzie Phillips, and Timothy B. Schmit among them. There are songs drawn from across the spectrum of Torks career, including a gorgeous, folk-style cover of Take a Giant Step that made this reviewer smile so emphatically it was mixed with tears of joy; the exquisitely funny Milkshake, a delightfully wry account of life on the road that includes Nesmith and Dolenz and some of the most charmingly silly choruses ever heard in a legitimate rock song; MGB-GT, a very personal car song that may be particularly potent to middle-aged survivors of the 1960s; and Higher and Higher, a folk/gospel song on which Tork mostly plays acoustic banjo, and which is so beguiling that one wishes hed do an entire album in that idiom, style, and sound. Not every song here is quite that good, and three of the numbers probably could have been dispensed with, but eight out of 11 isnt bad.|$|R
6000|$|... "Most pictures," [...] he said, [...] "have two sides, but we {{need only}} look at one. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that we shall get them. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{remember}} the only true thing that fellow Selingman ever said: that our lesson had come {{before it is too}} late. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the heart and conscience of the nation is still a live thing. If it is, dear, the end is certain. And I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that it is!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let her be." [...] He {{turned on}} the rising young journalist, and his massive face was unusually massive and his voice fine and full and fruity. [...] "Do you think we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make our public believe {{anything}} simply because it's true? They know perfectly well what they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> and what they aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> and they aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> anything about mermaids--you bet your hat. I don't care if the whole damned beach was littered with mermaids--not the whole damned beach! We've got our reputation to keep up. See?... Look here!--you don't learn journalism as I hoped you'd do. It was you what brought in all that stuff about a discovery in chemistry----" ...|$|R
5000|$|The narrator (Roberto Bolaño) {{recalls a}} dream about meeting the dead poet Enrique Lihn; a {{previous}} correspondence with him included {{a discussion of}} Chile's [...] "six tigers of Chilean poetry" [...] (including Bolaño himself) though {{by the time of}} their meeting none of the poets had achieved much, excluding Rodrigo Lira, who had committed suicide. In spite of their past correspondence Lihn does not acknowledge knowing the narrator when they are introduced, and the narrator also pretends that they are not acquainted. Later on Lihn suddenly realizes that he is dead, and the narrator leaves him. Out on the street he runs into someone he doesn't know who confuses him with someone else, and Bolaño plays along. The man soon realizes his mistake, but then proceeds to play along himself, pretending that he knows Bolaño. Both are aware of the game, and Bolaño constructs a whole story regarding the man, whom he calls Jara, and his supposed life. Bolaño returns to Lihn and they go to his surreal apartment, which seems to have a glass floor and constantly changes in structure and appearance. They eventually return to the bar where Lihn tells him that [...] "The tigers are finished, and, It was sweet while it lasted, and, You’re not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this,</b> Bolaño, but in this neighborhood only the dead go out for a walk." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned over}} {{a paper on}} his desk. [...] "You didn't know, of course," [...] he said. [...] "But what I want to have"--and his voice grew wrathful--"is sure {{evidence}} that you didn't know. No jury on earth is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> you didn't know. No jury!---- Why,"--his mask dropped--"no man on earth is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> a yarn like that! If that's all you have, Stratton----" ...|$|R
5000|$|But, says Jesus, {{since you}} do not believe what Moses wrote, how are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> what I say?" [...] (...) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{that it was}} the praying," [...] said Cecily decidedly. [...] "It's so {{much nicer}} <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that God cured Pat than that Peg Bowen did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I am delayed, my good André, then anyhow {{the game}} is up. But we are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{anticipate}} misfortune and we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in our lucky star." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Captain Kittridge," [...] said Moses, with a toss of superb contempt; [...] "if you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> all he says, you've {{got your}} hands full." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But here's a {{new thing}} that Melton has been telling me of, that all the world is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in,' said Mr. Cassilis, 'something patronised by Lady Everingham.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See here! if you fellows are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> such a {{story as}} {{these kids are}} giving you, you can't work for me!" [...] roared Carson Davenport, with a scowl.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder how}} much longer we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in 'luck' and 'coincidence,'" [...] she said, after some remark of his. [...] "Maybe it's all thought {{transference}} or telepathy or something." ...|$|R
5000|$|... : However, {{for this}} reason I {{obtained}} mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all long suffering, as a pattern {{to those who are}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> on Him for everlasting life.|$|R
6000|$|... "I like Deacon Enos," [...] replied Susan; [...] "he {{was always}} {{kind to me}} when I was a little girl, and I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{that he is a}} bad man now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I can. But, Beth, I don't give up yet. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{that it is}} a sick fancy, and not let {{you think}} it's true." [...] said Jo, trying to speak cheerfully.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am afraid}} he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> himself Thalaba {{as well as}} Sintram,' said Laura. 'But you know Southey did not see all this himself, and did not {{understand}} it when it was pointed out.' ...|$|R
60|$|LETTY. I {{do think}} people are horrible, always {{thinking}} things. It's not as if Molly were a stranger. She's my own cousin. I 'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> anything about my own cousin. I simply won't.|$|R
6000|$|He {{paused and}} resumed in a curt, businesslike manner: [...] "Daly's tale is {{plausible}} {{and may be}} true, but I have my doubts. Anyhow, I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it because that doesn't suit my plans. We'll have Walters tried for murder." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{interpretation}} is much closer in design {{to the original}} 1960's incarnation, but writer/artist Monsanto adds a new and unexpected twist to the character. You're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> who Captain Barbell's new alter-ego turns out to be—Darna's not so little brother, the teenager Ding.|$|R
6000|$|... "Laura {{takes it}} awfully hard, but I don't think she ought to--at least not yet," [...] {{said the girl}} from Star Ranch. [...] "There {{may not be a}} word of truth in the story. Anyway, I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it until they prove it." ...|$|R
60|$|LETTY. Don't! Suppose they are! If joy were to hear it'd {{be simply}} awful. I like Molly. I 'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{anything}} against her. I don't see {{the use of}} it. If it is, it is, {{and if it is}} n't, it is n't.|$|R
5000|$|... "If you're honest, there's no {{guarantee}} that people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> you, {{but if you get}} into some kind of a problem, and you're not honest, boy you bury yourself: you get deeper and deeper in trouble, and you can tell the whole world that you're honest, and nobody will believe you." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} crafted due to [...] "a person {{response}} from Wickham. Wickham was leading worship at {{this thing called}} Harvest Crusade. And {{there were thousands of}} people who responded and said that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in Jesus. And that was a response to God saving all these people. This is the day for salvation." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wilkens reminisces, that {{situation}} during genocide was very complex, {{that he was}} working often {{on the edge of}} law and morality: I was in so many positions that could have been interpreted as compromising or even collaborating with the enemy. … Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> someone who goes to court and says, [...] "Well, actually I asked prime minister to help me save some Tutsis? Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that? The stuff in the genocide just turns."Wilkens himself, to save peoples lives, was negotiating with Col. Tharcisse Renzaho - governor of Kigali and with prime minister Jean Kambanda later sentenced to life imprisonment by International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ICTR. General Romeo Dallaire was facing the same dilemma: is it morally acceptable to [...] "shake hand with the Devil" [...] in order to save someone's life? But effects of such negotiations - thousands of saved human beings - make ones feel, that it was worthy to pay the price.|$|R
60|$|Nasmyth was {{a little}} {{astonished}} at finding himself ready <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do I know it, indeed!' she cried. 'I know no such thing! I know no such thing! Do {{you think}} a man's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> walk into this bar, and tell me off-hand I'm his Missis, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> him?--I say <b>to</b> you, whoever you may be, you're mistaken. I know myself for no Missis of yours, and I'll thank {{you to go out}} of this house, this minute, before I get those that will put you out.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] she cried. [...] "It's {{more than}} that. Don't think I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> you. I know you, with your smooth-sounding lies. You're a liar, as you know. And I know you've been {{doing other things}} besides play a flute in an orchestra. You!--as if I don't know you. And then coming {{crawling}} back to me with your lies and your pretense. Don't think I'm taken in." ...|$|R
60|$|BLANCO [ignoring the interruption]--and {{you found}} a man without a horse. Is {{a man on a}} horse the same as a man on foot? Yah! Take your witness away. Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> her? Shove her into the dustbin. Youve got to find that horse before you get a rope round my neck. [He turns away from her contemptuously, and sits at the table {{with his back to the}} jury box].|$|R
5000|$|... “So in {{the second}} half I didn’t let Flanagan throw any more passes. And Kentucky tied the game in the fourth quarter. Naturally I thought the {{officials}} cheated us somehow, else we’d have won. No young coach is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> he lost on his own merit. Preacher Franklin, who has a Coca-Cola distributorship in Birmingham now and is one of my television sponsors, was the Vanderbilt team manager, and he always had my ear." ...|$|R
5000|$|There are so {{many things}} that went on in his life that were like, you've got to be kidding. ... Nobody's ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that, but with {{a lot of things in}} the movie, we didn't want to back away from it or create {{something}} that was false. ... So we tried to make it as genuine as we could and to be straightforward about it and not back away. —Bill Pohlad, June 2015 ...|$|R
50|$|Old Grandad Tree: A tremendously rugged tree atop a hill, {{there is}} reason <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> is a very old tree.|$|R
5000|$|Moretz also commented [...] "It's a movie. If you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> and be {{affected}} by an action film, you shouldn't go to see Pocahontas because you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> think you are a Disney Princess. If you are that easily swayed, you might see The Silence of the Lambs and think you are a serial killer. It's a movie and it's fake, and I've known that since I was a kid... I don't want to run around trying to kill people and cuss. If anything, these movies teach you what not to do." ...|$|R
