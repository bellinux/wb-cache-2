5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing {{is implied}} {{about how a}} {{particle}} gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one {{does not imply that}} it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> confuse {{diffusion}} with dispersion, as {{the former}} is a physical phenomenon and the latter is an empirical factor which is cast into a similar form as diffusion, because we already know how to solve that problem.|$|E
25|$|Like most dogs, Great Danes require daily {{walks to}} {{maintain}} their health. However, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> over exercise this breed, particularly when young. Great Dane puppies grow very large, very fast, which puts them at risk of joint and bone problems. Because of a puppy's natural energy, Dane owners often take steps to minimize activity while the dog is still growing.|$|E

25|$|When {{changes are}} {{introduced}} to the project, {{the viability of the}} project has to be re-assessed. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> lose sight of the initial goals and targets of the projects. When the changes accumulate, the forecasted result may not justify the original proposed investment in the project. Successful project management identifies these components, and tracks and monitors progress so as to stay within time and budget frames already outlined at the commencement of the project.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{fracture}}s, {{such as a}} toddler's fracture (spiral {{fracture of}} the shin bone), can also cause pain and limp, but are uncommon around the hip joint. Soft tissue injuries can be evident when bruises are present. Muscle or ligament injuries can be contracted during heavy physical activity —however, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> miss a slipped upper femoral epiphysis. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease) typically occurs in children aged 4–8, and is also more common in boys. There may be an effusion on ultrasound, similar to transient synovitis.|$|E
25|$|To begin {{bringing}} the horse back, {{he should be}} exercised at the walk and trot for 10–15 minutes at least once every day. This regimen will gradually be increased as the horse becomes more willing. For a moderate or severe bout of ER, it may take 4–6 weeks {{to return to the}} regular program. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> push the horse more than he is ready or a relapse may occur. A second bout of ER is usually more severe than the first, not only taking the horse out of training for a longer time, but possibly causing permanent muscle damage.|$|E

25|$|In {{highlighting}} {{the severity of}} the Free State's execution policy, however, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> exaggerate its extent. The Free State took a total of over 12,000 Republicans prisoner during the war, of whom roughly 80, less than 1% were executed. How those who were executed were chosen from the others captured in arms is unclear; however, many more men were sentenced to the death penalty than were actually shot. This was intended to act as a deterrent to anti-Treaty fighters in the field, who knew that their imprisoned comrades were likely to be executed if they kept up their armed campaign.|$|E
25|$|CP {{is not a}} {{progressive}} disorder (meaning the brain damage does not worsen), but the symptoms can become more severe over time. A person with the disorder may improve somewhat during childhood {{if he or she}} receives extensive care, but once bones and musculature become more established, orthopedic surgery may be required. The full intellectual potential of a child born with CP will often not be known until the child starts school. People with CP {{are more likely to have}} learning disabilities, although these may be unrelated to IQ, including varying degrees of intellectual disability. Intellectual level among people with CP varies from genius to intellectually impaired, as it does in the general population, and experts have stated that it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> underestimate the capabilities of a person with CP and to give them every opportunity to learn.|$|E
25|$|According to Michel Christol though, this {{interpretation}} overly restricts {{the meaning of}} the word libertas. In Christol’s view, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> forget that the emperor’s decision in 205 must have been taken in response to a request made by the civitas and must have taken account of the relations that already existed between it and the pagus. It was the autonomy that the civitas had achieved during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and the granting of Roman law that raised the spectre of a fusion of the two communities, which would without a doubt have provoked a certain unease in the pagus. The inhabitants of the pagus would have expressed “concern or even refusal when faced with the pretensions of their closest neighbours”. This would explain the honour that the pagus attributed to Commodus (conservator pagi, protector of the pagus) '.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{controversy}} was sparked {{when the}} words [...] "fucker" [...] and [...] "cock" [...] were censored {{out of the}} live performance of the song [...] "Professional Widow".

50|$|It <b>is</b> an <b>important</b> {{point that}} {{the man in the}} mask served as a valet. Fouquet was never {{expected}} to be released; thus, meeting Dauger was no great matter, but Lauzun was expected to be set free eventually, and it would have <b>been</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have him spread rumours of Dauger's existence. Historians have also argued that 17th-century protocol made it unthinkable that a man of royal blood would serve as a manservant, casting some doubt on speculation that Dauger was in some way related to the king.|$|R
25|$|The {{recovery}} {{swings the}} arms sideways {{across the water}} surface to the front, with the elbows straight. The arms should be swung forward {{from the end of}} the underwater movement, the extension of the triceps in combination with the butterfly kick will allow the arm to be brought forwards relaxed yet quickly. In contrast to the front crawl recovery, this arm recovery is a ballistic shot. The only other way of lifting the arms and the shoulders out of the water is by dropping one's hip. Therefore, the recovery, at least the acceleration of the arms, is in no way relaxed. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> enter the water too early, because this would generate extra resistance as the arms moved forward in the water against the swimming direction, however, during longer distances, this cannot be avoided, and it is more important to avoid dropping one's hips. A high elbow recovery, as in front crawl, would be disadvantageous because of the natural undulations that are partially caused by the recovery and the relaxed movement caused by the momentum of a triceps extension. Limitations of the shoulder movement in the human body make such a motion unlikely. Hands should enter into the water again at 11 and one with thumbs entering first and pinkie last.|$|E
500|$|Narcissi {{are well}} suited for {{planting}} under small thickets of trees, {{where they can be}} grouped as 6–12 bulbs. They also grow well in perennial borders, especially in association with day lilies which begin to form their leaves as the narcissi flowers are fading. [...] A number of wild species and hybrids such as [...] "Dutch Master", [...] "Golden Harvest", [...] "Carlton", [...] "Kings Court" [...] and [...] "Yellow Sun" [...] naturalise well in lawns, but it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> mow the lawn till the leaves start to fade, since they are essential for nourishing the bulb for the next flowering season. Blue Scilla and Muscari which also naturalise well in lawns and flower {{at the same time as}} narcissus, make an attractive contrast to the yellow flowers of the latter. Unlike Tulips, narcissi bulbs are not attractive to rodents and are sometimes planted near tree roots in orchards to protect them.|$|E
500|$|As {{soon as he}} {{achieved}} success he began polishing the Coward image: an early press photograph showed him {{sitting up in bed}} holding a cigarette holder: [...] "I looked like an advanced Chinese decadent in the last phases of dope." [...] Soon after that, Coward wrote, [...] "I took to wearing coloured turtle-necked jerseys, actually more for comfort than for effect, and soon I was informed by my evening paper that I had started a fashion. I believe that to a certain extent this was true; at any rate, during the ensuing months I noticed more and more of our seedier West-End chorus boys parading about London in them." [...] He soon became more cautious about overdoing the flamboyance, advising Cecil Beaton to tone down his outfits: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> let the public have a loophole to lampoon you." [...] However, Coward was happy to generate publicity from his lifestyle. In 1969 he told Time magazine, [...] "I acted up like crazy. I did everything that was expected of me. Part of the job." [...] Time concluded, [...] "Coward's greatest single gift has not been writing or composing, not acting or directing, but projecting a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ninety-nine {{percent of}} it (Migrant) was written on piano, so I think it felt right to keep that a focal point. But also, I think, it was a {{conscious}} decision to make it a slightly more stripped-down record, as far as the scope and the grandeur goes. The idea was to keep the tone in general a little bit smaller with not so many doubles and big rock guitar and heavy spots on the record...with the lyrics of this new record being transparently about myself, I think it <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> dehumanize the performances by over-layering them or over-doubling them. As you double vocals, they lose their intimate inflection, and whatever transparent emotion that's trying to be conveyed in them is washed out, which can be a good thing.

2500|$|Computerized {{cognitive}} behavioral therapy (CCBT) {{has been}} described by NICE as a [...] "generic term for delivering CBT via an interactive computer interface delivered by a personal computer, internet, or interactive voice response system", instead of face-to-face with a human therapist. It is also known as internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy or ICBT. CCBT has potential to improve access to evidence-based therapies, and to overcome the prohibitive costs and lack of availability sometimes associated with retaining a human therapist. In this context, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> confuse CBT with 'computer-based training', which nowadays is more commonly referred to as e-Learning.|$|E

2500|$|It {{used to be}} {{difficult}} to maintain a wood floor properly. However, if the directions of the floor manufacturer are followed properly modern treatments will maintain a good surface. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> just trust a commercial office cleaner to know how to do a good job, they should be instructed to follow the directions. There are no cheap and foolproof machines around for measuring traction which would enable cleaners to see their work conforms to dance or sports requirements. [...] Thus there is a very strong inclination for managers or cleaners to go for other requirements e.g. a shiny surface or one that resists dirt better.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player chooses one of eight political parties, each with its own advantages. These advantages are cumulative with the civilizations bonuses, so they may be used to cement an established advantage, or to shore up a potential weakness. However, these bonuses are only preserved as long as the player's party stays in power, which depends on keeping morale up (generally above 50%). If the player loses an election they do not lose control of the game, only the bonuses previously granted. In addition, the bonus of the party currently in power (if you are not) is applied as a penalty to your civilization instead. [...] Morale also has an effect on reported population, and thus on tax revenue, so it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> tax for short-term gain.|$|E
2500|$|Jelly can be {{made from}} sweet, savory or hot ingredients.
