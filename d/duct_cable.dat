30|$|The University of South Africa’s (Unisa) Muckleneuk {{campus in}} Pretoria is host {{to a large}} number of pigeons. The birds gain access into the {{buildings}} through open access points such as loose exterior ceiling boards and open electrical and air conditioning <b>ducts</b> (<b>cabling</b> <b>ducts)</b> positioned on the exterior of the buildings. This easy access increases the number of protected and sheltered breeding and roosting sites available. It has also increased health concerns relating to the build-up of their faeces and associated fungi, nest mites and bird lice which have been reported to infest the offices and affect the staff working in certain buildings on campus. Faeces and accumulated nesting material build-up on the various external structures of the campus buildings have become an issue of concern. According to Ntshoe (pers. comm. 2013), large financial investments have been made in order to manage the birds and their associated problems on an ad hoc and reactive basis.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{electrical}} industry {{has a very}} limited number of "predictive tools " and those available are generally cost prohibitive to install and require some level of expertise. One tool that has been successfully applied in several integrated paper mills across North America is the continuous monitoring of medium and high voltage equipment for partial discharges. This includes motors, generators, switchgear, bus <b>duct,</b> <b>cables</b> and transformers. On-line measurement and assessment of partial discharges {{has proven to be}} an effective tool in evaluating the condition of insulation and thereby limiting unscheduled outages. This paper will discuss the experiences Alberta Pacific Forest Industries has had in applying periodic, continuous monitoring and off-line tests for partial discharges and show the effectiveness of this recently implemented program. Actual data collected and experiences from rotating equipment and switchgear in a large pulp and paper mill will be presented and discussed. I...|$|R

50|$|Both {{mechanical}} and intumescent dampers {{form part of}} passive fire protection (PFP) systems, such as fire-resistance rated walls, floors, or even <b>ducts</b> or <b>cable</b> tray fireproofing. As such, they are PFP systems. However, whether an opening is mechanically closed {{or whether it is}} the physical/chemical action of an intumescent that does the work, {{the fact that they are}} activated by heat and then move to fulfill a fire safety function, also technically qualifies them to form part of active fire protection (AFP) systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} or other mechanical components are necessarily linked to surrounding objects (the supporting joint - with the support; the unsupporting joint - the pipe <b>duct</b> or <b>cable),</b> thus presenting {{the opportunity for}} unwanted transmission of vibrations. Using a suitably designed vibration-isolator (absorber), vibration isolation of the supporting joint is realized. The accompanying illustration shows the attenuation of vibration levels, as measured before installation of the functioning gear on a vibration isolator as well as after installation, {{for a wide range}} of frequencies.|$|R

2500|$|The typical {{construction}} process for a wind turbine subsea monopile foundation in sand includes driving a large hollow steel pile, of some 4m in diameter with approximately 50mm thick walls, some 25m {{deep into the}} seabed, through a 0.5m layer of larger stone and gravel to minimize erosion around the pile. [...] A [...] "transition piece (complete with pre-installed features such as boat-landing arrangement, cathodic protection, <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> for sub-marine <b>cables,</b> turbine tower flange, etc.)" [...] {{is attached to the}} now deeply driven pile, the sand and water are removed from the centre of the pile and replaced with concrete. [...] An additional layer of even larger stone, up to 0.5m diameter, is applied {{to the surface of the}} seabed for longer-term erosion protection.|$|R

50|$|The {{company went}} {{underground}} {{in a big}} way in the 1920s, creating expensive new outside plant that fixed its geometry for the century to come. New <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> brought more reliable service to customers. They converged at approximately twenty wire centers, which were connected by larger trunk <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> running along the East and West Sides of Manhattan. The locations were a mile or two apart (2-3 km), close to concentrations of office workers without paying prime prices for land. At each wire center a new central office arose to house telephone switchboards, panel switches and other inside plant, and technicians, clerks, operators and other workers. The largest of these was also the corporate headquarters, at 140 West Street on the Lower West Side, about a kilometer (half mile) from AT&T HQ at 195 Broadway.|$|R
30|$|Penetrations in {{building}} elements are generally provided for mechanical, plumbing, air-conditioning and electrical services throughout a structure. Openings in elements are typically provided for pipes, <b>cables,</b> <b>ducts</b> {{and other services}} for business operations and building occupants. These penetrations require fire stopping where these services pass through a fire rated assembly.|$|R
50|$|Steel wire {{armoured}} cable, commonly abbreviated as SWA, is a hard-wearing {{power cable}} {{designed for the}} supply of mains electricity. It {{is one of a}} number of armoured electrical cables - which include 11 kV Cable and 33 kV Cable - and is found in underground systems, power networks and <b>cable</b> <b>ducting.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Penetrants, or {{penetrating}} items, are the mechanical, electrical or structural {{items that}} pass through {{an opening in}} a wall or floor, such as pipes, electrical conduits, <b>ducting,</b> electrical <b>cables</b> and cable trays, or structural steel beams and columns. When these items pierce a wall or floor assembly, they create a space between the penetrant and the surrounding structure, which can become an avenue for the spread of fire between rooms or floors. Modern building codes generally require a service penetration firestop to seal the openings around penetrants (or [...] "services"), in order to restore the fire-resistance rating of the parent assembly.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} of utility tunnels are {{the reduction of}} maintenance manholes, one-time relocation, and less excavation and repair, compared to separate <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> for each service. When they are well mapped, they also allow rapid access to all utilities without having to dig access trenches or resort to confused and often inaccurate utility maps.|$|R

From fiber out port the fiber patch will go to fiber optics based router.|$|R
30|$|Theo van Wijk, {{the largest}} {{building}} positioned {{on the far}} {{western side of the}} campus, has 11 levels uniform in design with balconies and exterior <b>cabling</b> <b>ducts</b> running the length of the building. Due to its y-shape, the building offers two north facing and two south facing aspects. The Philadelphia cafeteria is positioned on the third floor, which includes an extensive catering balcony.|$|R
50|$|Heat {{stabilizers}} {{are mainly}} used for construction products made of polyvinyl chloride, for instance window profiles, pipes and <b>cable</b> <b>ducts.</b> Light stabilizers, for instance HALS, are especially needed for polypropylene and polyethylene. The {{environmental impact of}} stabilizers for polymers can be problematic because of heavy metal content. In Europe lead stabilizers are increasingly replaced by other types, for example calcium-zinc stabilizers.|$|R
5000|$|Platforms 2 and 3 on the [...] "fast" [...] lines - {{although}} still by definition in use - have been mothballed, and their gravelly surface together with protruding <b>cable</b> <b>ducting</b> poses a trip hazard and renders them {{unlikely to be}} used by passengers even should a disruption prevent use of the [...] "slow" [...] lines at platforms 1 and 4.|$|R
50|$|Switches are {{available}} in many form factors, including: desktop units not mounted in an enclosure which are typically intended {{to be used in}} a home or office environment outside a wiring closet; rack-mounted switches for use in an equipment rack; large chassis units with swappable module cards; DIN rail mounted for use in industrial environments; and small installation switches, mounted into a <b>cable</b> <b>duct,</b> floor box or communications tower, as found, for example, in FTTO Infrastructures.|$|R
50|$|A utility tunnel, utility corridor, or utilidor is {{a passage}} built {{underground}} or above ground to carry utility lines such as electricity, steam, water supply pipes, and sewer pipes. Communications utilities like fiber optics, cable television, and telephone cables are also sometimes carried. One {{may also be}} referred to as a services tunnel, services trench, services vault, or cable vault. Smaller cable containment {{is often referred to as}} a <b>cable</b> <b>duct</b> or underground conduit. Direct-buried cable is a major alternative to ducts or tunnels.|$|R
