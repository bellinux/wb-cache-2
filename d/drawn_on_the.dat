5|$|Ponies are taxonomically {{the same}} animals as horses. The {{distinction}} between a horse and pony is commonly <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of height, especially for competition purposes. However, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of phenotype, including conformation and temperament.|$|E
5|$|A {{new game}} {{mechanic}} {{to the series}} {{is the use of}} a slate found on all the Ages. These slates can be carved using the mouse to create shapes and symbols. The use of the slate is necessary to communicate with a shadowy race of creatures known as the Bahro. The Bahro understand certain symbols <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slate and will respond to them; the creatures also retrieve the slate and return it to its original space if the player drops it. Slate symbols can cause environmental changes such as rain or increased wind, which may be necessary for solving puzzles. The slate cannot be carried everywhere due to its size. For example, the player will have to leave the slate behind if they want to climb a ladder.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Welsh writers have <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{lives of the}} quarrymen for their material, for example the novels of T. Rowland Hughes. Chwalfa, {{translated}} into English as Out of their night (1954), has the Penrhyn Quarry dispute as a background, while Y cychwyn, translated as The beginning (1969), follows the apprenticeship of a young quarryman. Several novels by Kate Roberts, {{the daughter of a}} quarryman, give a picture of the area around Rhosgadfan, where the slate industry was on a smaller scale and many of the quarrymen were also smallholders. Her novel Traed mewn cyffion (1936), translated as Feet in chains (2002), gives a vivid picture of the struggles of a quarrying family in the period between 1880 and 1914. Y Chwarelwr ("The Quarryman") produced in 1935 was the first Welsh-language film. It showed various aspects of a slate quarryman's life at Blaenau Ffestiniog.|$|E

5|$|Later, Stottlemeyer and Disher {{watch the}} film's {{shooting}} and Natalie's prediction is right: Ruskin has impersonated Monk {{to the point}} that he is unable to complete the sequence because he is hassled by the setting's disorder. He leaves the studio, goes to Monk's house to know what are his reasons to do his job, and explores Monk's files on Trudy's murder, grieving Monk. An afflicted Monk goes to Natalie's house, where he solves the case when he sees torn paper by Julie to prevent Natalie from reading it.

5|$|On 24 November 1939, Hanbury Brown wrote a memo on Suggestions for Fighter Control by RDF {{calling for}} {{a new type of}} radar that would {{directly}} display both the target aircraft and the intercepting fighter, allowing ground controllers to directly control the fighter without need for interpretation. The solution was to mount a radar on a motorized platform so it rotated continually, sweeping the entire sky. A motor in the CRT display would rotate the beam deflection plates in synchronicity, so blips seen when the antenna was at a particular angle would be displayed at the same angle on the scope display. Using a phosphor that lasted at least one rotation, blips for all targets within range would be <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> display at their correct relative angles, producing a map-like image known as a PPI. With both the bombers and fighters now appearing on the same display, the radar operator could now direct an intercept directly, eliminating all of the delays.|$|E
5|$|Placing the {{elements}} into categories and subcategories based on shared properties is imperfect. There is {{a spectrum of}} properties within each category {{and it is not}} hard to find overlaps at the boundaries, as is the case with most classification schemes. Beryllium, for example, is classified as an alkaline earth metal although its amphoteric chemistry and tendency to mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes of a chemically weak or post-transition metal. Radon is classified as a nonmetal and a noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that is more characteristic of a metal. Other classification schemes are possible such as the division of {{the elements}} into mineralogical occurrence categories, or crystalline structures. Categorizing the elements in this fashion dates back to at least 1869 when Hinrichs wrote that simple boundary lines could be <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> periodic table to show elements having like properties, such as the metals and the nonmetals, or the gaseous elements.|$|E

5|$|Research in the 1960s by Eliécer Silva Celis on {{the rock}} art of Sáchica showed phytomorphic designs, masked human figures, {{singular}} and concentric rings, triangulated heads, and faces where the eyes and noses were drawn, but the mouths absent. The majority of the petrographs found here are abstract figures. The colours red, black and white dominate the rock paintings in Sáchica. The black has been analysed also at El Infiernito and is though {{to refer to a}} pre-Muisca origin. Radial structures <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heads of the anthropomorphic petrographs are interpreted as feathers. Feathers were precious objects for the Muisca and used by the xeques and caciques during the El Dorado ritual in Lake Guatavita.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 9 September, {{the party}} visited the races, where the prince's horse won the Clumber Stakes.

Edward was banker and Williams acted as the croupier. When Gordon-Cumming arrived at the table, there were only two vacant seats. At either of them, Gordon-Cumming would be surrounded by members of the Wilson family, all of whom had been informed of Stanley and Levett's suspicions.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{exhibited a}} contrast of bare nave walls against the paintings <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> metal ceilings {{leading to the}} main altar and retablo mayor. The ceiling paintings {{were known to be}} works of Raymundo Francia, as shown by his signature on one corner of the dome in the 1930s. An acknowledgment on the initiative of the San Tarcisio Martir Maribojoc Catholic Association 'Comité de Obras' could also be seen painted before the crossing. Several paintings by Francia on metal had deteriorated even before the total destruction of the church by earthquake in 2013. The Francia paintings were never touched up nor repainted. The new church dome (or cimborrio) was constructed in June 1889. Ray Francia was again commissioned to do mural works on the cimborrio by painting the Epistles of The Four Apostles, namely the saints John, Matthew, Luke and Mark.|$|E

5|$|Æthelbald lived until 757 {{and carried}} Mercian {{power to a}} new height. His debt to Crowland was not forgotten: soon after his {{accession}} he richly endowed a new church on the site where Guthlac had lived as a hermit. The first Life of Guthlac, written by the monk Felix, appeared soon after Guthlac's death. Nothing is known about Felix, although Bertram Colgrave has observed {{that he was a}} good scholar who evidently had access to works by Bede and Aldhelm, to a Life of Saint Fursey and Latin works by Saint Jerome, Saint Athanasius and Gregory the Great. Felix was either an East Anglian or was living in the kingdom when he wrote the book, which was written at the request of Ælfwald. In the Life, Felix portrays Æthelbald's exile at Crowland and asserts Ælfwald's right to rule in East Anglia. Two Old English verse versions of the Life <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> work of Felix were written, which show the vigour of vernacular heroic and elegiac modes in Ælfwald's kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Allen's cricket {{remained}} {{limited in}} 1931. Despite all-round success in several early games for Middlesex, he was initially {{omitted from the}} team for the first Test against the New Zealand team. When Larwood withdrew with an ankle injury, Allen {{was added to the}} team; according to Anthony Meredith, writing in The Cricketer in 2002, Pelham Warner made this decision himself without consulting his fellow selectors, to their considerable annoyance. Allen did not have a particularly good match as a bowler, but was successful with the bat. When he started his innings {{at the beginning of the}} second day, England had scored 190 for seven wickets in reply to New Zealand's 224. He scored 98 in the 150-minute first session, and went on to score 122; with Les Ames, he added 246 for the eighth wicket. This was a record partnership in Test matches for the eighth wicket until 1996, and an England record for that wicket until 2010. England scored 454, but New Zealand replied with 469 and the match was <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third and final day. This was Allen's only innings of the series.|$|E
5|$|Sports in Manila have a {{long and}} {{distinguished}} history. The city's, and in general the country's main sport is basketball, and most barangays have a basketball court {{or at least a}} makeshift basketball court, with court markings <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets. Larger barangays have covered courts where inter-barangay leagues are held every summer (April to May). Manila has many sports venues, such as the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex and San Andres Gym, the home of the now defunct Manila Metrostars. The Rizal Memorial Sports Complex houses the Rizal Memorial Track and Football Stadium, the Baseball Stadium, Tennis Courts, Memorial Coliseum and the Ninoy Aquino Stadium (the latter two are indoor arenas). The Rizal complex had hosted several multi-sport events, such as the 1954 Asian Games and the 1934 Far Eastern Games. Whenever the country hosts the Southeast Asian Games, most of the events are held at the complex, but in the 2005 Games, most events were held elsewhere. The 1960 ABC Championship and the 1973 ABC Championship, forerunners of the FIBA Asia Championship, was hosted by the complex, with the national basketball team winning on both tournaments. The 1978 FIBA World Championship was held at the complex although the latter stages were held in the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, Southeast Asia's largest indoor arena at that time.|$|E
