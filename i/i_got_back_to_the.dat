60|$|The {{first thing}} I saw when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ship was Ransome on the quarter-deck sitting quietly on his neatly lashed sea-chest.|$|E
6000|$|It {{happened}} after I {{had been in}} America for a few months. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flat latish one night, and when Jeeves brought me the final drink he said: ...|$|E
60|$|And {{that evening}} when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club {{and talked about}} it at dinner to my {{business}} friends, I found that I had only heard {{a small part of}} it.|$|E
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Yes. I {{missed it}} when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Claridge’s, and <b>I</b> thought I might {{possibly}} have dropped it here.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ray and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{her flat}} this evening. Who {{do you think}} was there? The mater! She was sitting hand in hand with old Danby.' ...|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my room <b>I</b> {{locked the}} door behind me, {{and went to sleep}} in the dark. I did not want light just then--could not bear it.|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cave Bill {{and the boy}} {{were not}} to be found. I {{explored}} the vicinity of the cave, and risked a yodel or two, but there was no response.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house I {{had only}} {{a quarter of an hour}} to spare to put myself in order for dinner, and to say two words to Laura before I went downstairs.|$|E
60|$|I dined at {{the club}} and looked in at a show afterward, and it wasn't till fairly late that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flat. There were no signs of Motty, and I took it that {{he had gone to}} bed.|$|E
60|$|Disappointed, again, when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Boston; for <b>I</b> was {{promising}} myself half an hour's look at you, in Belmont; {{but your}} note to Osgood showed {{that that could}} not be allowed out yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. The {{first time}} I went to Oz I found you there, ruling the Emerald City. After you {{went up in}} a balloon, and escaped us, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Kansas {{by means of a}} pair of magical silver shoes." ...|$|R
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my {{breakfast in}} the Boar's coffee-room, I found Mr. Pumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook (not {{improved}} in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and addressed me in the following terms:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--is it not? Twelve {{years ago}} I {{took off my}} shoes and {{stockings}} and had them dried in that cottage, and when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house I was put to bed for having been out all day in the wood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't forgotten," [...] said Woods. [...] "You {{counted out}} twenty fifties without a word. I'll {{pay it back}} some day. That {{thousand}} saved me and--well, they were piling my furniture {{out on the sidewalk}} when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house." ...|$|E
60|$|I woke up B. when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carriage, {{and persuaded}} him to go and have a wash; and in {{listening}} to the distant sound of his remarks when he likewise discovered {{that there was no}} towel, the recollection of my own discomfiture passed gently away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tank you, missus; de Lord bress you {{for what}} you've done, wheder I get Massa Wingfield off or wheder we bofe get killed ober de job. But I must get back as fast as I can. Ef it was dark before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> camp dey would wonder whar I had been." ...|$|R
60|$|He wished me good-night, {{and held}} up his light. I walked {{by the side of}} the down Line of rails (with a very disagreeable {{sensation}} of a train coming behind me) until I found the path. It was easier to mount than <b>to</b> descend, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my inn without any adventure.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Mary, if {{you will}} be a little patient with me you shall know {{everything}} I have to tell, and then you will know exactly why I didn't come to you the moment <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> town. For {{the last two or three}} days I have been in pursuit of the Chances, and have at last found them." ...|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house already dismally affected, I {{was still}} more sadly downcast {{at the sight}} of Mary. She had her sleeves rolled up over her strong arms, and was quietly making bread. I got a bannock from the dresser and sat down to eat it in silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp," [...] Laura {{continued}} rapidly, [...] "there wasn't a soul there {{except the}} Chinaman. He {{told me that}} Lenora had ridden off {{a few minutes before}} to find you. We came to look for her. We found her handkerchief on the road there, and that's her horse." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was past}} ten o'clock {{that night when}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp, where I found Hans the Hottentot about to start to look for me, {{with two of the}} Zulus, and told him that I had been {{detained}} by accidents to the wagon. The Vrouw Prinsloo was still up also, waiting to hear of my arrival.|$|E
6000|$|... "So, after Mother Hubbard {{had given}} me a good meal of turnips and sliced cabbage, Santa Claus put the magic collar around my neck and I started for home. I took my time on the journey, for I knew nothing could harm me, and I saw a good many strange sights before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> this place again." ...|$|R
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Horta from Cayenne {{and saw the}} [...] "Anarchist" [...] again, he did {{not look}} well. He was more worn, still more frail, and very livid indeed under the grimy smudges of his calling. Evidently the meat of the company's main herd (in its {{unconcentrated}} form) did not agree with him at all.|$|R
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my observatory, <b>I</b> found Mr. Jay digesting his mutton-chops in an armchair, {{with his}} pipe in his mouth. On his table were two tumblers, {{a jug of}} water, and the pint bottle of brandy. It was then close upon seven o'clock. As the hour struck the person {{described}} as [...] "Jack" [...] walked in.|$|R
6000|$|... "I got a ride part o' the {{way from}} Commercial Road to Aldgate by getting on the wrong bus, but it wasn't much good, and I was quite tired by the time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wharf. I waited outside {{for a minute or}} two to get my wind back agin, and then I went in-boiling.|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> servants' hall, {{the bell}} {{was going for}} our dinner. Afternoon already! and the {{materials}} for making the new nightgown were still to be got! There was but one chance of getting them. I shammed ill at dinner; and so secured {{the whole of the}} interval from then till tea-time to my own use.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nursery {{there was}} such an uproar in the parlor that I looked in, and there was Mr. Bhaer down {{on his hands and}} knees, with Tina on his back, Kitty leading him with a jump rope, and Minnie feeding two small boys with seedcakes, as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> England for Christmasand then ... we were {{to start}} on the thing which turned into Let It Be. And {{straight}} away, again, it was just weird vibes. You know, I found I was starting {{to be able to}} enjoy being a musician, but the moment <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> with the Beatles it was just too difficult. - Harrison to Crawdaddy, 1977 ...|$|R
40|$|After I {{finished}} my blog project Bilateral Kellerberrin in WA (April-May 2005) I had an epiphany. In Kellerberrin, I had an amazing time “getting {{to know the}} townsfolk” 2000 km from home, but when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my own suburb, I {{was struck by how}} little I knew my own neighbours. So I decided to do the exact same project at home: and that’s what became Bilateral Petersham: April-May 2006...|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{faith in}} you was never shaken, sweetheart. But I went to Newmarket and Ampthill, and behaved like the ingrate I was. I richly {{deserved}} the scolding {{he had for}} me when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> town, which sent me running to Arlington Street. There I met Dr. James coming out, who asked me if I was Mr. Carvel, {{and told me that}} you had called my name." ...|$|R
60|$|Before dinner I had call to go {{into the}} woodshed. I heard a scuttling as I opened the door. If I am not mistaken, Miss Dorton was hiding in the corner where we keep the coke. I didn't see any good in making a fuss, so I left her there. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kitchen, cook asked me if we'd got any parsley.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall the jug was empty, and Mr. Dark was comforting {{himself with}} a pinch of snuff, {{snorting}} over it like a perfect grampus. He had swallowed more than a pint of the strongest old ale in the house; and, for all the effect {{it seemed to have}} had on him, he might just as well have been drinking so much water.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{yesterday}} evening, squire, I {{went down}} into the village to buy some 'bacca. Just as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gate, out runs a boy. It was too dark {{for me to see}} his face, but I naturally supposed it were Reuben, so I said, 'Hello, Reuben, how's the leg?' But the moment I spoke, he turned off from the path and ran away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Martin and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Harbour Head {{too late}} last night to cross over," [...] said her mother. [...] "It would have been madness to try to cross in the storm, {{although}} I was nearly wild thinking of you two children. It's well I didn't know the whole truth or I'd have been simply frantic. We stayed at the Head all night, and first thing this morning came your father." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{my hotel}} without having met any one whom I knew, {{and that night}} I {{received}} a note from Barker, stating that he had fully intended coming to the steamer to see me off, but that an engagement would prevent him. He sent, however, his best good wishes for my safe passage, and assured me that he would keep me fully informed {{of the state of}} my affairs on this side.|$|R
60|$|I {{was in no}} humor {{for talking}} a moment longer with my sour-tempered {{companion}} than I could help. The day was wearing on me fast; and, whether night overtook me or not, I was resolved never to stop on my return till <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Fondi. Accordingly, after telling the father superior that he might expect to hear from me again immediately, I made my bow and hastened out of the sacristy.|$|R
