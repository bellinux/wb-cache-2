5|$|In May 2014, <b>Inmarsat</b> {{said that}} it would offer its {{tracking}} service for free to all aircraft equipped with an <b>Inmarsat</b> satellite connection (which amounts to nearly all commercial airliners). <b>Inmarsat</b> also changed the time period for handshakes with its terminals from one hour to 15 minutes.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 8May several satellite experts questioned the analysis of satellite pings made by <b>Inmarsat</b> staff because the Doppler frequency shifts measured were apparently not properly corrected against the satellite's own drift (a periodic North-South oscillation of 3° every 24hours). Without any additional data being released, the implication of this new analysis was that the northern portion of the <b>Inmarsat</b> satellite pings arc could not be ruled out. The Malaysian government released the satellite data three weeks later.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March, <b>Inmarsat</b> {{provided}} basic {{flight data}} relating to Flight 370 to SITA, which relayed information to Malaysia Airlines and investigators. On 9–10 March, <b>Inmarsat</b> engineers {{noted that the}} ground station log recorded pings from the aircraft for several hours after contact was lost with air traffic control. Malaysian investigators set up an international working group, consisting of various agencies with experience in aircraft performance and satellite communications, to further analyse the signals between Flight 370 and the ground station, especially the signal at 08:19. These included representatives from the UK's <b>Inmarsat,</b> AAIB, and Rolls-Royce; China's Civil Aviation Administration and Aircraft Accident Investigation Department; the US NTSB and FAA; and Malaysian authorities.|$|E

50|$|There {{is also a}} clear upgrade {{path from}} SwiftBroadband to <b>Inmarsat's</b> Global Xpress system, a {{constellation}} of three Ka band satellites which will come on stream in 2014-2015 and will globally provide downlink bandwidths of up to 50 Mbit/s.SITAOnAir was appointed as distribution partner for <b>Inmarsat's</b> Global Xpress service in November 2011.|$|R
5|$|The SDU on 9M-MRO (the {{aircraft}} {{used for}} Flight370) logged onto the <b>Inmarsat</b> network at midnightMYT. In the 30 minutes prior to take-off, seventeen messages were exchanged between the SDU and the <b>Inmarsat</b> network. An additional three messages were exchanged between take-off {{and the time}} Flight370 disappeared from secondary radar. The final message to use the ACARS protocol was sent at 01:07; ACARS reports expected at 01:37 and 02:07 were not received. At 02:03 and 2:05, messages from the ground station went unanswered, indicating that the link was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03.|$|E
5|$|The tower {{attracted}} {{a number of}} significant tenants, including <b>INMARSAT</b> and the independent radio station Capital Radio. The ITV broadcaster Thames Television's corporate headquarters were nearby at No.306–316 Euston Road from 1971 to 1992 when the station closed. That building was demolished in 1994 and redeveloped when Thames, now a production company, moved all operations to Teddington Studios.|$|E
5|$|Malaysian {{investigators}} set up {{an international}} working group—the Joint Investigation Team (JIT)—consisting of various agencies with experience in aircraft performance and satellite communications, to further analyse the signals between Flight 370 and the ground station, especially the signal at 08:19. These included representatives from the UK's <b>Inmarsat,</b> Air Accidents Investigation Branch, and Rolls-Royce; China's Civil Aviation Administration and Aircraft Accident Investigation Department; the US National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration; and Malaysian authorities.|$|E
50|$|SITAOnAir {{offers the}} {{satellite}} connectivity required for its onboard services using <b>Inmarsat's</b> SwiftBroadband service {{operating in the}} L band and prospectively <b>Inmarsat's</b> Ka band-based Global Xpress system {{which is expected to}} be launched in 2015. However customers are free to use third-party services for the backhaul to the ground. 90% of the onboard equipment can be used with any radio link, for example other satellite networks or a direct air-to-ground link.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1990s, many {{member states}} {{were unwilling to}} invest in {{improvements}} to <b>INMARSAT's</b> network, especially owing to the competitive nature of the satellite communications industry, while many {{recognized the need to}} maintain the organization's older systems and the need for an intergovernmental organization to oversee public safety aspects of satellite communication networks. In 1998, an agreement was reached to modify <b>INMARSAT's</b> mission as an intergovernmental organization and separate and privatize the organization's operational business, with public safety obligations attached to the sale.|$|R
500|$|Equipment at <b>Inmarsat's</b> Perth {{ground station}} had been {{upgraded}} in 2013 with additional storage capacity and new software to record an expanded data set for transmissions, including {{the addition of}} Burst Frequency Offset (BFO) and Burst Timing Offset (BTO) values. Without {{the addition of the}} BFO and BTO values, {{it would not have been}} possible to determine the aircraft's distance from the satellite at each handshake and hence significantly narrow the search region. The expanded data values were prompted by <b>Inmarsat's</b> involvement in the search for Air France Flight447, which disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. The company felt the additional data values could be useful in future incidents. According to <b>Inmarsat's</b> vice-president of satellite operations, Mark Dickinson, the company [...] "did not know precisely how [...] might be useful but [...] had a hunch and decided to [...]" ...|$|R
5|$|On 24 March, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak {{appeared}} before media at 22:00 local {{time to give}} a statement regarding Flight 370, during which {{he announced that he}} had been briefed by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch that it and <b>Inmarsat</b> (the satellite data provider) had concluded that the airliner's last position before it disappeared was in the southern Indian Ocean. As there were no places there where it could have landed, the aircraft must therefore have crashed into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{communications}} between Flight 370 and the satellite communication network operated by <b>Inmarsat,</b> which were relayed by the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite, provide {{the only significant}} clues {{to the location of}} Flight 370 after disappearing from Malaysian military radar at 02:22 MYT. These communications have also been used to deduce possible in-flight events (see next section). The investigative team was challenged with reconstructing the flight path of Flight 370 from a limited set of transmissions with no explicit information about the aircraft's location, heading, or speed.|$|E
5|$|After initial {{analysis}} {{determined that}} Flight370's last location was within Australia's Search and Rescue {{region in the}} southern Indian Ocean, Australia has {{played a major role}} in co-ordinating the analysis in conjunction with Malaysia. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is responsible for the search for Flight370 and has brought together a team of experts to determine the location of Flight370 at the 08:19 communication. The team brought together by the ATSB includes the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Boeing, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (Australia), Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation, <b>Inmarsat,</b> the National Transportation Safety Board (US), and Thales.|$|E

5|$|The JACC is {{responsible}} for coordinating the search efforts for Flight 370 within Australian waters. At {{the time of the}} agency's creation, the search effort involved China, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States as well as several agencies of the Australian government: the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), the Department of Defence, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The search activities also involved analysis of the flight's satellite communications by <b>Inmarsat,</b> the AAIB (UK), the NTSB (US), and other organisations.|$|E
5|$|The {{datalink}} for Malaysia Airline's avionics {{communications at}} the time of the incident was supplied by SITA, which contracted with <b>Inmarsat</b> to provide a satellite communication link using Inmarsat's Classic Aero service. Aeronautical satellite communication (SATCOM) systems are used to transmit messages from the aircraft cockpit as well as automated messages from on-board systems using the ACARS communications protocol, but may also be used to transmit FANS and ATN messages and provide voice, fax, and data links using other protocols. An appropriate comparison of ACARS' relationship to the SATCOM system is that of a messaging application to a smartphone; the smartphone functions and will remain registered on a mobile phone network even if the messaging application is closed.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March, Australia {{took control}} for {{co-ordinating}} search, rescue, and recovery operations. For the following six weeks, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) and ATSB worked {{to determine the}} search area, correlating information with the JIT and other government and academic sources, while the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) coordinated the search efforts. Following the fourth phase of the search, the ATSB took responsibility for defining the search area. In May, the search strategy working group was established by the ATSB to determine the most likely position on the aircraft at the 00:19 UTC (08:19 MYT) satellite transmission. The group included aircraft and satellite experts from: Air Accidents Investigation Branch (UK), Boeing (US), Defence Science and Technology Group (Australia), Department of Civil Aviation (Malaysia), <b>Inmarsat</b> (UK), National Transportation Safety Board (US), and Thales (UK).|$|E

5|$|The {{analysis}} of communications between Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and Inmarsat's satellite telecommunication network provide {{the only source}} of information about Flight 370's location and possible in-flight events after it disappeared from radar coverage at 2:22Malaysia Standard Time (MYT) on 8March 2014 (17:22UTC, 7March), one hour after communication with air traffic control ended and the aircraft departed from its planned flight path while over the South China Sea. Flight370 was a scheduled commercial flight with 227 passengers and 12 crew which departed Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at 0:41 and was scheduled to land in Beijing, China at 6:30China Standard Time (6:30MYT; 22:30UTC, 7 March). Malaysia has worked in conjunction with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to co-ordinate the analysis, which has also involved the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, <b>Inmarsat,</b> and US National Transportation Safety Board, among others. Others have also made efforts to analyse the satellite communications, albeit challenged by a lack of publicly available information for several months after the disappearance. On 29July 2015, debris was discovered on Réunion Island which was later confirmed to come from Flight 370; it is the first physical evidence that Flight370 ended in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
