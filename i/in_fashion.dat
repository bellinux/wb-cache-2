5|$|By the 15th century, English {{was back}} <b>in</b> <b>fashion</b> among all classes, though much changed; the Middle English form showed many signs of French influence, both in {{vocabulary}} and spelling.

5|$|The eldest {{daughter}} of Charles Wintour, {{editor of the}} London Evening Standard (1959–76), her father consulted her {{on how to make}} the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era. She became interested <b>in</b> <b>fashion</b> as a teenager. Her career <b>in</b> <b>fashion</b> journalism began at two British magazines. Later, she moved to the US, with stints at New York and House & Garden. She returned to London and was the editor of British Vogue between 1985 and 1987. A year later, she assumed control of the franchise's magazine in New York, reviving what many saw as a stagnating publication. Her use of the magazine to shape the fashion industry {{has been the subject of}} debate within it. Animal rights activists have attacked her for promoting fur, while other critics have charged her with using the magazine to promote elitist views of femininity and beauty.|$|E

5|$|Cortina {{is home to}} some of {{the most}} prestigious names <b>in</b> <b>fashion,</b> {{including}} Bulgari, Benetton, Gucci and Geox, and various artisan shops, antiquarians, and craft stores. It is also home to many stores specializing in mountaineering equipment. The symbol of Cortina shopping remains La Cooperativa di Cortina, founded on June 28, 1893 as Consumverein Ampezzo. In this shopping centre many trades can be found, from confectioners to newspaper vendors, toys, gift shops, skiing stores and blacksmiths. The building is divided into three levels (more a raised plan and a balcony). The cooperative in Cortina was one of the first cooperatives founded in the Italian Peninsula, and currently provides employment to approximately 200 people.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{professional}} life was distinctive {{in that he}} never ceased to investigate mechanical building structures. Early on, Gaudí was inspired by oriental arts (India, Persia, Japan) through {{the study of the}} historicist architectural theoreticians, such as Walter Pater, John Ruskin and William Morris. The influence of the Oriental movement can be seen in works like the Capricho, the Güell Palace, the Güell Pavilions and the Casa Vicens. Later on, he adhered to the neo-Gothic movement that was <b>in</b> <b>fashion</b> at the time, following the ideas of the French architect Viollet-le-Duc. This influence is reflected in the Teresian College, the Episcopal Palace in Astorga, the Casa Botines and the Bellesguard house {{as well as in the}} crypt and the apse of the Sagrada Família. Eventually, Gaudí embarked on a more personal phase, with the organic style inspired by nature in which he would build his major works.|$|E

5|$|Governments and {{conservation}} groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that preserve and restore bird habitat, or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird {{that would otherwise}} have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the California condor and Norfolk parakeet. The British Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, founded as the Plumage League in 1889 to protect birds such as the egret from hunting for their plumes, used <b>in</b> <b>fashion,</b> has grown to have over a million members; it has been followed by similar societies in other countries. A more specialised organisation, the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, works to conserve waterfowl and their wetland habitats, with projects around the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, when Harper's Bazaar UK {{merged with}} Queen to become Harper's & Queen, Wintour {{was hired as}} one of its first {{editorial}} assistants, beginning her career <b>in</b> <b>fashion</b> journalism. She told her co-workers that she wanted to edit Vogue. While there, she discovered model Annabel Hodin, a former North London classmate. Her connections helped her secure locations for innovative shoots by Helmut Newton, Jim Lee and other trend-setting photographers. One recreated the works of Renoir and Manet using models in go-go boots. After chronic disagreements with her rival, Min Hogg, she quit and moved to New York with her boyfriend, freelance journalist Jon Bradshaw.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Watson {{began her}} {{modeling}} career {{with a photo}} shoot for Teen Vogue and was the youngest star to grace its cover. Three years later, the British press reported that Watson was to replace Keira Knightley as {{the face of the}} fashion house Chanel, but this was denied by both parties. In June 2009, following several months of rumours, Watson confirmed that she would be partnering with Burberry as the face of their Autumn/Winter 2009 campaign, for which she received an estimated six-figure fee. She also appeared in Burberry's 2010 Spring/Summer campaign alongside her brother Alex, musicians George Craig and Matt Gilmour, and model Max Hurd. In February 2011, Watson was awarded the Style Icon award from British Elle by Dame Vivienne Westwood. Watson continued her involvement <b>in</b> <b>fashion</b> advertising when she announced she had been chosen as the face of Lancôme in March 2011.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the {{majority}} of women were still wearing highly structured undergarments. Girdles were considered the ladylike norm and represented close to 40% of industry sales by volume. The 1960s also brought to Canadian Lady the challenges of feminism, fashions and the sexual revolution. The feminist movement—cultured by thought leaders like Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer—questioned the mores that defined women's roles and appearance. Changes <b>in</b> <b>fashion</b> trends, such as pantyhose {{and the rise of the}} miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women. While the intimate apparel industry fretted about bra-burning as a precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their animosity for their girdles. The Canadian sales data for foundation undergarments, from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes.|$|E
5|$|The Regency period saw a shift <b>in</b> <b>fashion</b> {{that was}} largely {{determined}} by George. After political opponents put {{a tax on}} wig powder, he abandoned wearing a powdered wig in favour of natural hair. He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over knee breeches because they were looser, and popularised a high collar with neck cloth because it hid his double chin. His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish tartan dress {{as it is known}} today.|$|E
