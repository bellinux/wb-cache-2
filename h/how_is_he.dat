It's a very sexy record, but it's fun. It's [...] great melodies; it's catchy; the beat knocks. It's so many different elements to it." [...] When asked <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> satisfied with Rihanna's vocals and his prediction on the song he further stated: [...] "She definitely murdered it vocally. I was just at the studio last week listening to a mix of it, and man, she killed it. I really feel like, this song, it's going to be big. I'm really excited about it." [...] "Watch n' Learn" [...] was recorded at Roc the Mic Studios in New York City and at Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg in Paris. The song was mixed by Marcos Tovar. Its vocal production was completed by Kuk Harrell and assisted by TT. and Jennifer Rosales.|$|E
2500|$|A notable {{incident}} {{regarding this}} happened in Philadelphia in 1791, where a free black youth came to her house asking to be taught how to write. Subsequently, she placed the boy in a local evening school, though not without objections from a neighbor. Adams responded that he was [...] "a Freeman {{as much as any}} of the young Men and merely because his Face is Black, is he to be denied instruction? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> to be qualified to procure a livelihood? ... I have not thought it any disgrace to my self to take him into my parlor and teach him both to read and write." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And now, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> to be found? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> to {{be saved}} from justice? In the few hours that I can {{possibly}} allow to elapse before I publish the truth, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> to be found by us, and only by us? Ten thousand pounds could not effect it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to live {{on without}} vindicating himself among people who {{suspected}} him of baseness? How could he go silently away from Middlemarch as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> retreating before a just condemnation? And yet <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to set about vindicating himself? ...|$|R
6000|$|And the {{difficulties}} {{about the girl}} were almost worse to bear than those about the boys. She had done nothing wrong. She had given no signs of extravagance or other juvenile misconduct. But she was beautiful and young. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to bring her out into the world? <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to decide whom she should or whom she should not marry? <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to guide her through the shoals and rocks which lay {{in the path of}} such a girl before she can achieve matrimony? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{turned away}} from the spot in which he had confronted her and walked to the window. What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to do? <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to help her? And <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to <b>be</b> rid of her? <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to save his {{daughter}} from further contact with a woman such as this? And <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to bid his daughter behave to this woman as one woman should behave to another in her misery? Then too he had learned to love her himself,--had yearned to call her his own; and though this in truth was a minor sorrow, it was one which at the moment added bitterness to the others. But there she stood, still waiting her doom, and it was necessary that that doom should be spoken by him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'However, I want to {{hear all}} the news about them from you,' said Miss La Creevy. 'How is the old rough and tough monster of Golden Square? Well, of course; such people always are. I don't mean <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> in health, but <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> going on: <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> {{behaving}} himself?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He says, in his wandering, {{that you}} know him; that he was your friend once, long ago; {{that he is the}} ruined father of a student here--my mind misgives me, of the young gentleman who has been ill. What is to be done? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> to be followed? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> to be saved? Mr. Redlaw, pray, oh, pray, advise me! Help me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph! <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> {{going to}} earn it--writing poetry? They don't pay {{much for that}} kind of writing, to my way of thinking." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> {{to declare}} that the very perils which {{threatened}} her had made a man of him, with all of a man's yearning to share these perils and shield her from them? <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to speak at all of those perils? He did not declaim, yet when he spoke, an enduring sincerity which she could not deny was in his voice.|$|R
60|$|But <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to find him? On {{this the}} great Valentin's ideas {{were still in}} process of settlement.|$|R
6000|$|<b>How</b> to <b>be</b> rid of them? There <b>was</b> the difficulty. <b>He</b> {{had made}} up his mind to be rid of them that day. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to begin? ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{who will}} never rise though rulers plods [...] His liberties despising [...] <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> manlier than the sans culottes [...] Who's always rising? ...|$|E
6000|$|Harker {{groaned and}} said, [...] "And {{this is all}} arrayed against my darling! But <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> experimenting? The {{knowledge}} may help us to defeat him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing to excuse," [...] I said. [...] "I've {{always been}} a Socialist--of a sort--in theory. Let's go {{and have a look}} at him. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>he?</b> Deflated?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ahuh! Well, well!" [...] replied Wade, {{with his}} head bowed. [...] "It is just queer I can never remember.... An' <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to-day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There were {{words in}} your {{message to the}} Black One who is dead of a certain man--nay, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> named?--of a certain Mopo." ...|$|R
60|$|Stephen Merrill was a man, {{and a good}} man, as men go. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to {{tell her}} the degrees by which <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> led into his present situation? <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to explain that these degrees had been so gradual that his {{conscience}} had had but a passing wrench here and there? Politics being what they were, progress and protection had to be obtained in accordance with them, and there was a duty to the holders of bonds and stocks.|$|R
6000|$|Language like this, as sincere {{as it was}} lofty, {{supplies}} the true test by which to judge Mr. Gladstone's conduct both in the Ionian transaction and many another. From the point of personal and selfish interest any simpleton might see {{that he made a}} mistake, but measured by his own standard of public virtue, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> to be blamed, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> not to be applauded, for undertaking a mission that, but for an unforeseen accident, might have redounded to the honour and the credit of the British power? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hell! You mean to {{give his}} Indian title, I suppose, {{to show that he}} will prove {{dangerous}} to the wicked. But <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> called in our own tongue?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And how,' asked Mr Pecksniff, {{drawing off}} his gloves and warming his hands before the fire, as benevolently {{as if they}} were {{somebody}} else's, not his; 'and <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> now?' ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned away}} with a sudden sinking of the heart. He knew, too well, that her {{carelessness}} <b>was</b> not assumed. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to interpret it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In Yorkshire?--and what {{character}} did he bear then, or <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> engaged?" [...] said Oldbuck,--"and why did not you recognise {{him when}} I introduced you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{this was}} all that took place at that meeting. As Mr. Camperdown said to John Eustace, it was {{manifest}} enough that she meant [...] "to hang on to them." [...] "I only hope Lord Fawn will not be fool enough to marry her," [...] said Mr. Camperdown. Lord Fawn himself was of the same way of thinking;--but then <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to clear his character of the charge which would be brought against him; and <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to stand his ground before Frank Greystock? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{speak of}} it," [...] said the clergyman. [...] "Hot water and {{blankets}} don't cost much, {{and you will}} {{have to pay for the}} brandy and the doctor. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>he,</b> doctor?" ...|$|E
60|$|Alas! poor slacker. I knew him, Horatio; {{a fellow}} of {{infinite}} jest, of most excellent fancy. Where be his gibes now? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> {{to cope with the}} fiendish ingenuity of the examiners? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> to master the contents of a book of Thucydides in a couple of days? It is a fearsome problem. Perhaps he will get up in the small hours and work by candle light from two till eight o'clock. In this case he will start his day a mental and physical wreck. Perhaps he will try to work and be led away by the love of light reading.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{brother is}} wildly delirious," [...] he said; [...] "they have bound his injured arm {{to his side}} with a sash, but they cannot leave him. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> to be got down?" ...|$|E
60|$|Here was a poser for Gonzaga. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to {{go about}} such a {{business}} as that? It was beyond his powers. Thus much he protested frankly.|$|R
6000|$|For {{the moment}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{incapable}} of speaking, incapable of finding an answer sufficiently emphatic. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> {{to tell her}} of the rocks upon which his love was built? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When is what to be?" [...] he asked, {{in a low}} voice, all but dumb-founded. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> {{to put an end}} to this conversation, {{and what}} <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to say to her? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{doubt whether}} he will care about seeing me again, among strangers," [...] Emily replied. [...] "And you forget that there are {{obstacles}} in his way. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> to leave his class?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{doubt if}} I looked as queer as you!" [...] she {{retorted}} with homely force. [...] "And {{if he was}} so bad then as that comes to, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> such an angel now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} put the candle out!" [...] the child returned, with strong emphasis. [...] "My new papa is coming. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> {{to find his way}} to us, if you put out the light?" ...|$|E
6000|$|What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to say? <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to refuse, {{when that}} soft little hand was held out to him; when those eyes laden with tears just ventured {{to look into}} his face? ...|$|R
6000|$|K. Ferd. A braver man I had {{not in my}} host; His murderer {{shall not}} long his conquest boast: But, Duke of Arcos, say, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> slain? ...|$|R
6000|$|Though it {{was still}} early, his mind had been {{employed}} for some hours past in considering how the second and only difficulty, which now stood {{between him and the}} possession of the Hair Bracelet, might best be overcome. Having already procured the first requisite for executing his design, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> next to profit by what he had gained? Knowing that the false key would be placed in his hands that evening, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to open Mr. Blyth's bureau without risking discovery by the owner, or by some other person in the house? ...|$|R
