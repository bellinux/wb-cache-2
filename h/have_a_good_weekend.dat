But he’s going to call her tomorrow night. I’ll call you Thursday and let you know what the story is, and how to get in touch with her. I don’t think much of the idea of you coming up on the train alone. I’m glad your family likes me, Dottie. I think your folks are swell. I’m sending that carton of Luckies for your father tomorrow.
