40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the competitiveness and improve the environmental performance of district heating in the future it may be of essence to transition to lower operating temperatures over those of the current third generation district heating systems. This {{is due to the fact}} that heat demands are expected to decrease as buildings become more energy efficient as well as new types of heat sources are likely to be integrated. The third generation district heating systems operate at annual average temperatures of 75 - 90 °C supply and 40 - 50 °C return in Sweden today. However, these temperatures are well above the customer temperature demands which are to heat buildings to approximately 20 °C and provide domestic hot water at 50 °C. Therefore, future supply and return temperatures of 50 - 55 / 20 - 30 °C for the next fourth generation district heating systems have been suggested. Radiators in buildings constructed prior to the 1980 's have in Sweden typically been designed for supply temperatures of 80 °C to provide space heating. However, as buildings are renovated, this temperature must be lowered to avoid overheating. For buildings constructed subsequent to 1982 the radiator design supply temperature should be a maximum of 60 °C. Several previous studies have established what the temperatures on the primary side of the district heating systems are, however there is a lack of documentation on the temperatures of the secondary side. The purpose of this project is therefore to investigate the radiator temperatures on the district heating secondary side. In this research project, data for 109 radiator systems for multi-family dwellings in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden, has been analyzed. Supply and return temperatures for the <b>design</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> have been calculated based upon available data measurements for one year. Factors affecting the operating temperatures of the radiators, such as radiator size and hydronic balancing, have also been examined. The results show that the average supply and return temperatures for the <b>design</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> of - 16 °C are 64 and 42 °C respectively. The radiator sizes were shown to be decreasing with increasing supply temperatures, where the largest potential of lowering the radiator operating temperatures were found in the systems with a large radiator size and a lower specific space heating demand.

40|$|This master thesis {{investigates the}} Norwegian {{standard}} for calculating necessary power demand, NS-EN 12831 : 2003 - Varmesystemer i bygninger - Metode for beregning av dimensjonerende effektbehov. In that context, {{it is also}} investigated how power demand affects heating systems financially and environmentally, but {{also in terms of}} comfort and indoor air quality. Improved energy efficiency are leading to a reduction in the power demand for heating purposes in buildings. However, there are few guidelines for how the power demand for heating should be calculated at room level or at building level and correspondingly little documentation on thermal comfort and power demand in low-energy and passive houses. Dimensioning heating systems correct is very important for comfort, energy and finance. Net power demand over the year should determine the distribution between base load and peak load. It is crucial that the estimated power demand correspond to real power demand in order to find the optimal distribution. Gross power demand is the basis for net power demand. A more realistic net power duration curve leads to a more profitable distribution between base load and peak load. If a safety margin is desirable, one should install an additional peak load, which is a cheap investment. That will not affect the operating costs appreciable, as it hardly will be in use. Buildings are complex and there could be many reasons why real power consumption do not match the calculated and intended power demand. Larger heat loss than calculated may be a result of an inaccurate calculation method, poor quality of the work in the construction phase and that the building is used in a different way than intended. Choosing a reasonable ventilation airflow at design conditions is important. In the winter, there is rarely any cooling demand, and the necessary ventilation airflow only depends on the airflow needed to ensure good indoor air quality. In passive houses and low-energy buildings it is cheaper to maintain good indoor air quality as the heat transfer coefficient is low and the heat recovery in the ventilation system has good efficiency. It would seldom make financial sense to reduce indoor air quality, neither thermal nor atmospheric. Especially in commercial buildings, where a small percentage drop in performance would constitute a major cost in terms of wages to non-productive time.   The main improvement potential to the Norwegian standard, NS-EN 12831 : 2003, found in this master thesis is: 	One of the most obvious potentials for improvement is to include internal loads as lighting, computers and people to reduce the power demand. Especially at building level were one use a central heating system, in which the need of installed capacity will be reduced. At room level, one should be more careful and only include internal load that most certainly occurs at design conditions. The sum of the power demand at room level might then be larger than power demand at the building level, but it includes the uncertainty of using different rooms at different times. 	The calculation method for infiltration, particularly mechanical infiltration, have a potential for improvement. The American standard, ASHRAE 2013 takes into account that the airflow is not linear with the pressure difference across the building envelope. NS-EN 12831 : 2003 does not, but adds mechanical ventilation airflow as an addition, distributed by permeability. 	Heat release from ventilation fans and heat loss due to transmission and leakage from ducts are included in ASHRAE 2013, and is an improvement potential of the Norwegian standard. Heat release from the ventilation system in the investigated building is estimated to about 4, 8 kW at design conditions, which is 6, 7 % of calculated design power demand in the ventilation system. 	Clever control of the installed power is also a possibility. It is possible to drop night setback during the coldest periods or exploit installed capacity of domestic hot water. 	The Swedish standard, FEBY 12, seems to have the most detailed approach of how to choose <b>design</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature.</b> One finds the number of days in the n-days mean temperature method by calculating the heat storage in the actual building. FEBY 12 provides a method of grading the choice of <b>design</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> based on heat storage in the building. Several buildings should be examined in order to conclude that the recommendations given in this thesis are the best options. It will be much easier having a simpler control principle than in the investigated office in this master thesis. Being able to play with the control of the building will also make it a lot easier to eliminate sources of error. Nevertheless, the main principles found in this master thesis should be considered reliable...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the heating}} system, the water ejector {{can use the}} “surplus pressure” to pump return water from return pipe instead of using mixing pumps, thus {{achieving}} the purpose of energy conservation.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{energy consumption}} in the building sector enforces development in the field. One aims to cut the link between energy production and consumption, in order for environmental energy supply more of the demand and produce the energy as efficient as possible. In TEK 10 it is stated that minimum 60 % of the total energy demand must be supplied by other energy sources than electricity for buildings of more than 500 m 2 floor area. The main goal of this thesis was to assess different possibilities for thermal energy storage in buildings. Different storage technologies and materials apply. Water {{is the most common}} substance used for sensible thermal energy storage. Water is cheap, easy accessible and has excellent thermal properties for thermal storage. Rock and heavy building fabric is other materials that could be applied for sensible energy storage. When a material freeze it liberates heat to the surroundings, therefore possibilities for thermal energy storage in Phase Change Materials are of interest. These materials have good latent properties and desirable melting point temperatures. The most common phase change materials are organic, inorganic and eutectics. Around one hundred commercially available PCMs with a melting temperature in the range of 0 &# 8451; to 100 &# 8451; were identified. The latent heat of fusion of these materials was found to vary from 100 to 300 kJ/kg. An assessment of these materials showed that the salt hydrates had the highest latent heat of fusion. On the other hand, water has been known to diffuse through the capsule leading to incongruent melting of the PCM. This could lead to degradation of the system performance after numerous cycles. The most common technologies for thermal storage are the one utilizing water stored in a tank supplying the heating or cooling system in the building. Similar systems could be applied using PCMs, however a heat transfer fluid must supply the energy to the load in the building. A model for thermal energy storage was developed in this thesis. Both a model for both thermal stratification of water in a tank and for storage of energy in Phase Change Materials was developed. A given storage capacity was used to simulate a varying thermal load profile in a building. The overall goal of this program was to level the load profile. The model was applied to three buildings, one school, one office buildings and a building used for hotel, residential units and stores. Heating storage was assessed for two buildings while one was assessed for cooling purposes. Actual load profiles at the <b>design</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> was assessed. The simulations presented showed that the power demand in the school building could be reduced by 38. 8 % and 36. 4 % for the office building. The reduction was achieved using water storage of respectively 30 and 25 m 3. For the building where cooling storage were assessed, the reduction in the maximum power demand was reduced by 56. 7 % from 300 kW to 130 kW when utilizing a chilled water storage of 30 m 3. Chilled water storage are a challenge as the maximum density of water occurs at 4 &# 8451; and the difference in density for temperature close to this are small. This applies for high demand for proper diffusor design in the tank to prevent mixing of water at different temperature level. Proper stratification in the tank is important to maintain the highest possible supply temperature for the longest possible time period. The effect of proper stratification was assessed for a tank of 20, 000 L with a fixed volume flow discharged. The result presented showed that the energy supplied from the tank increased with 42. 2 % when applying 16 temperature zones compared to a fully mixed tank. The improvement of the tank was decreasing for the increasing number of stratification zones. Different solutions utilizing PCM was assessed. It was presented that the volume of the storage were decreasing when PCM was installed instead of water. One proposed solution indicated that the when Phase Change Materials were applied for a space heating purposes assuming a temperature difference of 10 &# 8451;, an organic PCM was reducing the storage volume by 2. 3 times while a salt hydrate reduced the storage volume by 5. 3 times. This assessment indicated that salt hydrates are the most energy intensive of the PCM possibilities. Different geometries for the encapsulated PCMs determine the heat transfer to the heat transfer fluid (in many cases water). Three different geometries were assessed: cubic, cylindrical and spherical encapsulations. Applying the same tank volume, the same volume of the PCMs, same volume flow of the heat transfer fluid and the same heat transfer coefficient the spherical capsule would generate 40 % more heat for the heat transfer fluid than the cubic geometry and 24 % more than the cylindrical capsule. There are some weaknesses in the PCM model. It was assumed that the temperature in the tank was uniform. This will not apply for the real case where the heat transfer fluid temperature will increase while transferring through the tank. For a realistic case, the temperature of the first elements will decrease rapidly because of large temperature difference between the heat transfer fluid and the PCMs in the tank. </p...|$|E

A 1 degrees C increase in indoor temperature reduced systolic blood pressure by an average of 0. 31 mmHg (95 % posterior interval: - 0. 44, - 0. 19). A 1 degrees C increase in <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> reduced blood pressure by the smaller average of 0. 19 mmHg (95 % posterior interval: - 0. 26, - 0. 11). Increased outdoor, but not indoor, temperatures had a stronger effect in women than in men. The effect of <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> remained after controlling for indoor temperature. Short-term trends in temperature did not have a statistically signicant effect. CONCLUSIONS: Indoor and <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> have independent effects on systolic blood pressure, and both should be controlled for in studies that measure blood pressure. Improved protection against cold temperatures could lead to a reduction in the winter excess of cardiovascular mortality...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{independent}} predictors of 2 -deoxy- 2 -[(18) F]fluoro-D-glucose ((18) F-FDG) uptake in brown adipose tissue (BAT) in patients undergoing repeated positron emission tomography (PET) /computed tomography (CT) scans. PROCEDURES: Eight hundred forty-eight (mean age 50. 9 [*]±[*] 16 years) patients in whom PET/CT scan was repeated (mean interval 5 [*]±[*] 1. 5 months) constituted the study group. (18) F-FDG uptake in characteristic areas of BAT, with CT density of adipose tissue, greater than background soft-tissue activity was considered as evidence of BAT uptake. Both distribution and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were registered. Clinical and anamnestic data were collected for each patient. RESULTS: (18) F-FDG uptake in BAT was present in 8. 6 % patients at first scan. Independent predictors of presence of uptake were age (younger), gender (female), body mass index (lower), and maximum <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> (lower). Age was the only independent predictor of BAT (18) F-FDG uptake distribution, while SUVmax was related to both age and <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature.</b> Independent determinants of persistence of BAT (18) F-FDG uptake at second PET/CT were <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> at time of second scan and extension of metabolically active BAT at first scan. CONCLUSIONS: Age, body mass index, and <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> are significant determinants of BAT evidence at (18) F-FDG PET/CT. Moreover, extension of BAT and <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> are the strongest determinants of persistence of BAT evidence on (18) F-FDG PET/CT in repeated scan...|$|R

40|$|Purpose / Context – Temperature {{is known}} to have impact on human health. In {{estimating}} such health effects <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> data are usually used as proxy for temperature exposure due to scarcity of indoor temperature data though humans {{spend most of their time}} indoor. Thus there is a need to investigate how <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> relates to indoor temperature especially in residential settings. Methodology / Approach – Field measurements were conducted in 15 residential houses in different suburb of Brisbane to identify the relationship between indoor and <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> during the winter season of 2016. Results –In the month of June the minimum indoor temperature ranged from 9. 56 – 16. 25 oC, whiles the maximum was between 22. 19 – 26. 50 oC. Also for the month of July minimum temperature ranged between 11. 75 – 16. 69 oC and the maximum temperature was between 24. 75 – 28. 31 oC. In the month of August, for indoor temperature minimum temperature was between 12. 31 – 17. 75 oC and a maximum of 22. 69 – 26. 31 oC. <b>Outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> recorded in the month of June varied between 2. 95 – 7. 80 oC for minimum range and 24. 00 – 32. 44 oC for maximum range. July minimum temperature ranged from 6. 25 – 9. 31 oC as maximum temperature was between 28. 50 – 34. 38 oC. Minimum <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> for the month of August was also between 5. 69 – 17. 75 oC as the maximum temperature ranged between 24. 44 – 35. 00 oC. Pearson correlation coefficient calculated between mean hourly indoor and <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperatures</b> ranged from 0. 25 – 0. 85. Key Findings / Implications – The results obtained indicated that indoor and <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperatures</b> relationship in residential settings may vary depending on factors including type of ventilation, insulation, type of building and behaviour of occupants. Originality – The findings attained will contribute to precise estimation of temperature exposure at a personal level especially in residential settings and empirical data will contribute to filling the gap of limited indoor temperature data...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Exposure to high ambient {{temperatures}} {{leads to}} an increase in mortality and morbidity, especially in the elderly. This relationship is usually assessed with <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature,</b> even though the elderly {{spend most of their time}} indoors. Our study investigated the relationship between indoor temperature and heat-related health problems of elderly individuals. Material and methods: The study was conducted in the Netherlands between April and August 2012. Temperature and relative humidity were measured continuously in the living rooms and bedrooms of 113 elderly individuals. Respondents were asked to fill out an hourly diary during three weeks with high temperature and one cold reference week, and a questionnaire at the end of these weeks, on health problems that they experienced due to heat. Results: During the warmest week of the study period (14 - 20 August), average living room and bedroom temperatures were approximately 5 degrees C higher than during the reference week. More than half of the respondents perceived their indoor climate as too warm during this week. The most reported symptoms were thirst (42. 7 %), sleep disturbance (40. 6 %) and excessive sweating (39. 6 %). There was a significant relationship between both indoor and <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperatures</b> with the number of hours that heat-related health problems were reported per day. For an increase of 1 degrees C of indoor temperature, annoyance due to heat and sleep disturbance increased with 33 % and 24 % respectively. <b>Outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> was associated with smaller increases: 13 % and 11 % for annoyance due to heat and sleep disturbance, respectively. The relationship between <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature</b> and heat-related health problems disappeared when indoor and <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperatures</b> were included in one model. Conclusions: The relationship with heat-related health problems in the elderly is stronger with indoor (living room and bedroom) <b>temperature</b> than with <b>outdoor</b> <b>temperature.</b> This should be taken into account when looking for measures to reduce heat exposure in this vulnerable group.

40|$|Abstract In {{this study}} the Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) {{data for the}} Seeb/Muscat area of the Sultanate of Oman is {{presented}} and analyzed. The analysis shows that diurnal variations in dry-bulb temperature are relatively small. However, seasonal variation indicates two distinct seasons: the hot season covering the months of April through to October (ambient temperature exceeds 30 °C {{for most of the}} hours) and the relatively cool season covering the months of November through to March (ambient temperature less than 27 °C for most of the time). Air conditioning (AC) is required over the seven-month hot season period. During the cool season the outdoor conditions are favourable for natural ventilation. The <b>outdoor</b> <b>design</b> <b>temperature</b> for the hot season may be deduced from the cumulative probability distribution calculated for the season. It is around 40 °C based on 2. 5 % summer frequency level. The high level of solar radiation fl ux available in Seeb (exceeding 500 W/m 2 for March through October) makes it attractive for solar energy based technologies. The information presented in this paper is essential for designers, architects, planners and contractors for proper design and selection of energy systems and application of energy-related projects in the most populated region in the Sultanate of Oman...|$|R
