[...] This sentiment was subsequently revealed to be a quote from 19th-century German Jewish intellectual, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.|$|E

In an interview with MTV News, Lovato said that it [...] "really describes the show. I'm excited about that." [...] Speaking of the video, co-director Malloy said, [...] "The idea for the video is to create this hyperreal world, that's the word we keep using, La La Land. Fame has definitely gotten to everybody's head. It's more like [...] {{is the only one}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> fame hasn't gotten to." [...] According to Lovato, her Sonny with a Chance co-stars play [...] "stereotypical Hollywood Los Angeles [...] big type of people." [...] The video premiered on December 19, 2008 on Disney Channel. It was released to the iTunes Store on January 20, 2009. For the video, the lyric [...] "I still eat McDonald's" [...] was changed to [...] "I still eat at Ronald's". Jefferson Reid of E! Online praised the video, writing, [...] "Mocking Hollywood phonies is always cool by us, and bonus points to Demi Lovato for doing it while rocking out in admirable form. Skewering the [...] "La La Land" [...] machine with sass and grit, Disney's latest everygirl rock star seems like she might eventually give Miley Cyrus a real run for her money." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 5, 1770, {{a street}} {{confrontation}} resulted in British soldiers killing five civilians in {{what came to}} be known as the Boston Massacre. The accused soldiers were arrested on criminal charges and had trouble finding legal representation. Adams ultimately agreed to defend them, though he feared that it would hurt his reputation. In arguing their case, Adams made his legendary statement regarding jury decisions: [...] "Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence." [...] He also expounded upon Blackstone's Ratio: [...] "It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever." [...] Adams won an acquittal for six of the soldiers. Two of them who had fired directly into the crowd were charged with murder but were convicted only of manslaughter. Adams was paid a small sum by his clients.|$|E
500|$|On the red suit, Maslansky said, [...] "We wanted {{something}} that looked militaristic and functional, but also dramatic and sexy" [...] adding that it was [...] "tricky" [...] making it practical. To {{begin the process of}} creating the suit, Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on Daredevil comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which led to the use of rivets and [...] "architectural" [...] shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with [...] "deeper portions" [...] in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, [...] "because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor’s face is going to be doing something else". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by Andy Park, discussions were had about having them holstered on the right leg, given that both Cox and his stunt double Chris Brewster are right handed, but it was ultimately decided to have the holster on the left hand side {{as it is in the}} [...] "classic profile" [...] of the comics. DeKnight explained that Murdock's Daredevil suit does not have the [...] "DD" [...] emblem on the chest as seen in the comics, because Murdock receives his moniker only after the suit is introduced. He also felt that the emblem was [...] "one of the more problematic emblems in superhero-dom", and that Daredevil's suit in the comics was [...] "very difficult to translate to screen, especially <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> is grounded and gritty".|$|E

2500|$|In 1952, Cartier-Bresson {{published}} his book Images à la sauvette, whose English-language edition was titled The Decisive Moment. It included {{a portfolio of}} 126 of his photos from the East and the West. The book's cover was drawn by Henri Matisse. For his 4,500-word philosophical preface, Cartier-Bresson took his keynote text from the 17th century Cardinal de Retz, [...] "Il n'y a rien dans ce monde qui n'ait un moment decisif" [...] ("There is nothing <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> {{does not have a}} decisive moment"). Cartier-Bresson applied this to his photographic style. He said: [...] "Photographier: c'est dans un même instant et en une fraction de seconde reconnaître un fait et l'organisation rigoureuse de formes perçues visuellement qui expriment et signifient ce fait" [...] ("To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organization of forms which give that event its proper expression.").|$|E

2500|$|The trope {{of masculinity}} {{continued}} in season two. Vox's Todd VanDerWerff stated, [...] "...above all else, True Detective wants {{to explore the}} role of men in society." [...] "Yet if season one was already interested in the topic, then season two has nearly jumped off the cliff with its obsessions, {{to the degree that}} Rachel McAdams's Ani is defined largely by her rejection of the more open and traditionally [...] "feminine" [...] New Age philosophy of her father and her embrace of the hardened, traditionally [...] "masculine" [...] life of the emotionally closed-off police officer," [...] he continued. VanDerWerff also noted that season two's three male leads are all dealing with their own issues of masculinity; [...] "Ray seems tortured by having to exist as a man <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> doesn't share his ideals," [...] "Frank is trying to walk a very noble, masculine path by taking his dark, dirty enterprise legitimate," [...] and [...] " [...] is mostly playing out a very typical story of a deeply repressed gay man who's trying to fight back his own impulses." ...|$|E

2500|$|West's rhetoric won him both {{support and}} {{condemnation}} from differing groups along the American political spectrum.

In January 2013, U.S. Representatives Paul Broun (R-Georgia) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) both voted for West as Speaker of the House, {{even though he was}} no longer a member of Congress. [...] Some of his statements include calling President Barack Obama [...] "an abject failure", ordering both pro-Palestinian demonstrators and the views of [...] "chicken men" [...] Democrats to [...] "get the hell out" [...] of the United States, opining that drivers with Obama bumper stickers are [...] "a threat to the gene pool", and pronouncing that African American Democrats are trying to keep African Americans [...] "on the plantation", while casting himself as the [...] "modern-day Harriet Tubman" [...] ferrying them to rescue.

2500|$|In the mid-16th century, {{the first}} Book of Common Prayer removed the {{ceremony}} of the ashes from the liturgy of the Church of England {{and replaced it}} with what would later be called the Commination Office. In that 1549 edition, the rite was headed: [...] "The First Day of Lent: Commonly Called Ash-Wednesday". The ashes ceremony was not forbidden, but {{was not included in the}} church's official liturgy. Its place was taken by reading biblical curses of God against sinners, to each of which the people were directed to respond with Amen. The text of the [...] "Commination or Denouncing of God's Anger and Judgments against Sinners" [...] begins: [...] "In the primitive Church there was a godly discipline, that, at the beginning of Lent, such persons as stood convicted of notorious sin were put to open penance, and punished <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> <b>that</b> their souls might be saved in the day of the Lord; and that others, admonished by their example, might be the more afraid to offend. Instead whereof, until the said discipline may be restored again, (which is much to be wished,) it is thought good that at this time (in the presence of you all) should be read the general sentences of God's cursing against impenitent sinners". In line with this, Joseph Hooper Maude wrote that the establishment of The Commination was due to a desire of the reformers [...] "to restore the primitive practice of public penance in church". He further stated that [...] "the sentences of the greater excommunication" [...] within The Commination corresponded to those used in the ancient Church. The Anglican Church's Ash Wednesday liturgy, he wrote, also traditionally included the Miserere, which, along with [...] "what follows" [...] in the rest of the service (lesser Litany, Lord's Prayer, three prayers for pardon and final blessing), [...] "was taken from the Sarum services for Ash Wednesday". From the Sarum Rite practice in England the service took Psalm 51 and some prayers that in the Sarum Missal accompanied the blessing and distribution of ashes. In the Sarum Rite, the Miserere psalm was one of the seven penitential psalms that were recited at the beginning of the ceremony. In the 20th century, the Episcopal Church introduced three prayers from the Sarum Rite and omitted the Commination Office from its liturgy.|$|E
