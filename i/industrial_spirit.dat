60|$|It is so {{recently}} as 1833 {{that the world}} first heard the word Socialism.[18] It appeared then, with the vaguest implications and the most fluctuating definition, as a general term for a disconnected series of protests against the extreme theories of Individualism and Individualist Political Economy; against the cruel, race-destroying <b>industrial</b> <b>spirit</b> that then dominated the world. Of these protests the sociological suggestions and experiments of Robert Owen were most prominent in the English community, and he it is, {{more than any other}} single person, whom we must regard as the father of Socialism. But in France ideas essentially similar were appearing about such movements and personalities as those of Saint Simon, Proudhon and Fourier. They were part of a vast system of questionings and repudiations, political doubts, social doubts, hesitating inquiries and experiments.|$|E
60|$|One can mark, too, {{various stages}} in this gradual process of secular descent from the wind-swept hills into the valleys below, as freer {{communications}} and greater security made access to water, roads, and rivers of greater importance than mere defence or elevated position. At Bath, for example, {{it was the}} Pax Romana that brought down the town from the stockaded height of Caer Badon, and the Hill of Solisbury to the ford and the hot springs in {{the valley of the}} Avon. At Old Sarum, on the other hand, the hill-top town remained much longer: it lived from the Celtic first into the Roman and then into the West Saxon world; it had a cathedral of its own in Norman times; and even long after Bishop Roger Poore founded the New Sarum, which we now call Salisbury, {{at the point where the}} great west road passed the river below, the hill-top town continued to be inhabited, and, as everybody knows, when all its population had finally dwindled away, retained some vestige of its ancient importance by returning a member of its own for a single farmhouse to the unreformed Parliament till '32. As for Fiesole, though Florence has long since superseded it as the capital of the Arno Valley, the town itself still lives on to our own time in a dead-alive way, and, like Norman. Old Sarum, retains even now its beautiful old cathedral, its Palazzo Pretorio, and its acknowledged claims to ancient boroughship. In England, I know by personal experience only one such hill-top town of the antique sort still surviving, and that is Shaftsbury; but I am told that Launceston, with its strong castle overlooking the Tamar, is even a finer example. This relatively early disappearance of the hill-top fortress from our own midst is in part due, no doubt, to the early growth of the <b>industrial</b> <b>spirit</b> in England, and our long-continued freedom from domestic warfare. But all over Southern Europe, as everybody must have noticed, the hill-top town, perched, like Eza, on the very summit of a pointed pinnacle, still remains everywhere in evidence as a common object of the country in our own day.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 - 12 In a {{changing}} urban landscape such as SoDo, Seattle, existing built fabric representing the area’s rich industrial history is often eliminated {{to make room}} for new development. When these remnants of the past are lost, a part of the neighborhood’s sense of place and identity is lost as well. This thesis proposes that the conservation of these built remnants will not only maintain this identity, but weave together the disparate uses and industries present in SoDo. Over the past decades, the area has transformed from Seattle’s manufacturing hub to the city’s stadium district, resulting in a variety of production industries that remain separated from the neighboring entertainment industry. The intervention proposed by this thesis is intended to mediate this separation, joining the industries by expanding an existing network of manufacturing and exposing the public to SoDo’s industrial activity, both past and present. Modern preservation is applied as an urban strategy in both site exploration and design, focusing on layers of history and context while looking towards the future as opposed to freezing the neighborhood in time. Conservation of SoDo’s urban fabric preserves its unique identity and ensures that the neighborhood maintains its <b>industrial</b> <b>spirit</b> in the decades to come. This thesis builds upon the area’s <b>industrial</b> <b>spirit</b> and proposes a building reuse project, inserting an artistic textile lab into an existing warehouse in the heart of SoDo. The facility fosters a relationship between old and new in its design and its updated program of manufacturing. The introduction of the textile lab aims to not only extend the lifespan of an existing structure, as preservation does, but to put the process of making on display to the public in order to weave the presence of the entertainment industry with the production industries of SoDo...|$|E

When these industrial towns are discussed it is not unusual too also mention a certain kind of mentality that is said to occur on these places, a kind of <b>industrial</b> <b>spirit</b> shared by the workers and in some regards also by the whole community.

40|$|Emanating from M. J. Wiener's, 'English Culture and the Decline of the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Spirit</b> 1850 - 1980 ', {{this work}} looks at {{contemporary}} literary reactions to businessmen, their environment and their activities {{in an attempt}} to determine whether a pro-industrial spirit dominated American culture {{at the time of her}} economic ascendancy 1850 - 1929. The aim is to assess the role a non-economic variable, culture, plays in a nation's economic performance. If Wiener's claim that culture plays a key role in determining the success or failure of a nation's economic performance is correct, then it would be expected that American culture would be unambiguously pro-industrial during the years 1850 - 1929. There is a review of the events and literature in the periods prior to 1850 which may have had a formative influence on American culture 1850 - 1929. This concludes that a spirit of optimism and a belief in progress and change were central to the American psyche. This optimistic ethos ameliorated the social and economic upheavals caused by the transition from being an agrarian society to becoming the premier industrial nation of the world. The onset and development of industrialization, however, inevitably caused mixed feelings which were reflected in contemporary literature. This work discusses the range of attitudes towards businessmen revealed in the literature - approbation through ambivalence to condemnation. Whilst a strong pro-industrial spirit can be detected in the literature analysed in this investigation, it is questionable whether it dominated American culture. There is also a body of adversarial literature which expresses doubts and concerns about the way in which industrial capitalism was organized and the moral values engendered by the system. Both sets of literature were popular and the ideas contained in them were therefore widely disseminated and presumably reflected the belief systems of their readership. From this it cannot be said that a pro-industrial spirit dominated America 1850 - 1929. Therefore this work concludes that the role culture plays in a nation's economic development and continued progress is only marginal...|$|E

40|$|In {{assessing}} the rapid emergence of Middlesbrough as a nineteenth century ‘boom town’, Asa Briggs’ seminal Victorian Cities {{pointed to the}} centrality of the early businessmen and industrialists in the growth of ‘a new community’. 1 The Quaker pioneers and the early ironmasters established the manufacturing basis of mid-Victorian Middlesbrough and dominated the Ironopolis’ early business associations, municipal institutions and political organisations. In contrast to the leading mid-century industrialists at the heart of urban governance in the manufacturing town, Briggs contended that the second and third generations of industrialist families failed to fill the void left behind by their retired or deceased fathers, instead abandoning the urban sphere and following the pattern of other English businessmen by choosing to live in the country rather than the town. This apparent urban ‘withdrawal’ aligned with what Wiener has considered a ‘decline in the industrial spirit’ amidst the adoption of a gentrified lifestyle, has been assumed rather than proven, with little exploration of the spatial dynamics of the industrial elites’ interactions with urban space. 2 This thesis challenges the extent of elite ‘withdrawal’ by assessing wider spheres of urban governance hitherto underexplored, contributing an improved understanding of the wider social dynamic of urban life and industrial elites with emphasise on challenging the extent of declining urban engagement. Drawing upon newly accessible archival evidence and focusing on {{late nineteenth and early twentieth}} century Middlesbrough as a case study, it is contended that this period, most closely associated with declining urban engagement, was instead one of realignment and reconfiguration of urban authority and industrialist participation. By exploring the composition and makeup of Middlesbrough’s charitable, commercial, civic and cultural life during this period, it will be shown how country house-residing elites continued to be engaged with the industrial centre and played an important role by establishing new infrastructure, institutions and organisations. Moreover, through exploring the hitherto underexplored semi-private realm of Middlesbrough’s steel magnates beyond the town in their country estates and the surrounding villages of the North Yorkshire countryside, it is argued the country house and rural sphere served as arenas for extending interactions with urban interests spanning business, associational, cultural and philanthropic activity. 1 Briggs, A.

40|$|The First World War caught Europe's {{military}} establishments largely {{unprepared for}} {{a conflict that}} exceeded contemporary expectations of length, scale and advances in technology. The British Army was no exception. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) may have entered the war {{as one of the}} most professional forces in the field, but throughout the war British generalship suffered from a distinct lack of imagination in their attempts at coping with the realities of modern warfare. Indeed, the names of such battles as Loos, Arras, the Somme, and Passchendaele evoke images of tragic and unnecessary waste of thousands of lives. Amongst all the major protagonists, Britain alone possessed a truly extensive catalogue of experience pointing to what a future conflict on continental Europe might entail, courtesy of the many colonial wars Britain fought during the nineteenth century. During the Omdurman campaign (1898) and the South African War (1899 - 1902) in particular, the brutal effectiveness of the machine gun, smokeless gunpowder, quick-firing artillery, trench warfare, and the complexities of organizing large formations were clearly demonstrated. These lessons seemed mostly forgotten or ignored, despite the existence of substantial reform sentiment and current criticisms of the Army's performance in Africa prior to 1914. Why had the British military failed to capitalize on its experiences in its African campaigns and bring those lessons with them into the First World War? Almost the entire British Army High Command from 1914 to 1918 had participated in the Sudanese and South African campaigns, yet virtually to the man they proved remarkably resilient in rejecting the lessons on modern warfare learned by the lower ranks at a very high human cost. Even when these lessons were reinforced by the observations of British officers during the Russo-Japanese War (1904 - 1905), they went largely ignored or misinterpreted. What prevented the senior British officers from heeding the voices of commonsense? Experiences during the South African War were considered anomalous and it was suggested impossible to apply to a European context. There was also a general trend of imparting more emphasis on personal training and qualities of elan as the best method of dealing with advanced battlefield technology. Britain's social hierarchy also played a part in this process, abetted by the fact that the majority of senior officers were from the Cavalry Arm, perhaps the most resistant to any sort of change or reform and comprised mainly of members of Britain's elite class. In addition, the British Army, like any other army in history, suffered from an institutional unwillingness to adopt new ideas and technology. A notoriously spendthrift British peace time government compounded the situation by ensuring that not only would there be substantial resistance to reform but that any reform would be constrained by tight fiscal considerations of Parliament and His Majesty's Treasury. This thesis will examine the reasons why the lessons of imperial and African conflicts were largely dismissed by military strategists on the eve of the Great War and reveal how such thinking lay in a long running conflict between the Victorian outlook on life and the new realities of the world ushered in by Industrialism. With the rise of Industrialism in Britain, this clash began to take form as the established British elite class saw a host of social ills residing within the movement that threatened their perceived order of society, especially their place at the top of that order. This clash of "progress versus nostalgia," a term coined by Martin J. Weiner in his book English Culture and the Decline of the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Spirit</b> 1850 - 1980, was a driving force behind the British High Command's struggle to undo the reform efforts of men such as Field Marshal Roberts and Richard Haldane as the Victorian/Edwardian elite class sought to bring this conflict to a resolution. The end result was that in 1914, the British Army, having only partially benefited from its African experience, was still in a state of transition and even those small gains had vanished along with most of the original BEF by early 1915...|$|E
50|$|Agriculture, {{which stood}} alone as Langenbach’s {{predominant}} economic factor {{well into the}} 20th century, still plays an important rôle today, although now {{only a few of}} the villagers actually earn their livelihoods at it. Once serving as an important facility for supplying the local population was the mill. The Langenbacher Mühle was named as early as 1446 in a reckoning of accounts from the Oberamt of Lichtenberg (this is also reckoned to be Langenbach’s ﬁrst documentary mention, although sources differ), and there is the ﬁrst Erbbestandsbrief (Erbbestand was a uniquely German landhold arrangement in which ownership rights and usage rights were separated; this is forbidden by law in modern Germany) from 1575. The mill crops up once again in the 1745 mill protocol, and towards the end of the 18th century, it was supposedly owned by a man named Jacob Benedum, who was for a time a member of Schinderhannes’s (Johannes Bückler’s) band of outlaws. The mill ﬂourished even into the time after the Second World War, but in the course of the “great mill die-off”, even the Langenbacher Mühle was eventually given up, sometime about 1955. It was later a children’s home and a restaurant. Today it is a private house. Most people in the workforce must commute to jobs elsewhere, in Kusel, Kaiserslautern and the Saarland. A whole series of independent shops and businesses can be found in the village, two rooﬁng businesses, one of which also builds wooden houses, a plastering and stuccoing business, a business that sells telecommunications systems, insurance agencies, a professional ofﬁce for ﬁnancing building projects, architects’ ofﬁces and a distillery. Otherwise, Langenbach is a residential community for people in the most varied of occupations. There may be certain opportunities in the future for tourism. The best known local business is the Ulrich distillery, which produces both grain-based <b>industrial</b> <b>spirits</b> and fruit schnapps made from local fruit.|$|R

Though the growth of crystals of smaller molecules is well studied, the crystal growth of these larger, conformationally complex molecules has been less thoroughly explored. A precursor of Amprenavir, a HIV drug, has been studied in this work. This intermediate, a flexible molecule with three chiral centres, is typically crystallised commercially from a mixed ethyl acetate – <b>industrial</b> methylated <b>spirit</b> solvent system as an ethanol solvate. Crystals of this solvate are consistently needle-like, being less than 10 microns wide. In an attempt to obtain a crystal of suitable size for single crystal X-ray diffraction, experiments were performed across a range of solvent systems, including those where an unsolvated phase is grown. After four months of trials, a chloroform – ethanol evaporative recrystallisation resulted in crystals of sufficient dimensions for structur...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRaman {{microspectroscopy}} {{has been}} {{proven to be a}} promising technique for diagnosis and early detection of pathologies. The data collected delivers a chemical fingerprint allowing the identification of specific biomarkers indicating the presence of abnormalities. Label free, fast and cost effective, Raman spectroscopy has already been proposed as the new generation of diagnostic tool with a strong potential but has not emerged in the medical field as yet. Notably, it is crucial to improve and adapt the protocols used to reach suitable reproducibility for screening large cohorts of patients. In this study, it is demonstrated that the variability existing in the data sets collected can be limiting. Notably, when working on cervical ThinPrep samples, the presence of blood residue can be detected by Raman spectroscopy swamping the cellular signal. However, combining a washing of the slides using H 2 O 2 and alcohol (70 % ethanol and 100 % <b>Industrial</b> Methylated <b>Spirits),</b> the blood features are removed from the data without altering either the cell morphology or the spectral features. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the improved potential of Raman spectroscopy for ThinPrep analysis based on improved protocols for sample preparation. Therefore, the screening of cervical cells for the detection of abnormalities and identification of patients with Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) is achievable...|$|R
40|$|In 1960 we {{published}} {{a method for}} assessing {{the volume of the}} vascular bed in the peripheral parts of cadaveric lungs (James et al., 1960). We have since used the method in studying the lungs from many cases of chronic cardiac and pulmonary disease. When examining the lungs from patients who had had coronary artery disease we noticed that the severity of the pulmonary arteriolar lesions varied with the clinical history. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate the relationship between the clinical syndromes and the abnormalities in the pulmonary arteriolar bed. We were able to study the lungs from two different groups of patients with coronary artery disease. Nine had had prolonged invalidism with many hospital admissions for left ventricular failure or chronic dyspncea. Eleven others had had no invalidism and had died suddenly apparently while in good health. METHOD At necropsy the main pulmonary artery of one lung was injected with a radiopaque medium containing a known concentration of radio-iodinated serum albumin. It was then fixed and dis-tended by introducing <b>industrial</b> methylated <b>spirit</b> into the main bronchus. The specimen was then radiographed and blocks were taken for histology. Pieces of about 40 ml. in volume were then cu...|$|R
