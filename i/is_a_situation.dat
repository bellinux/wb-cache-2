5|$|Host-{{parasite}} mimicry <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where {{a parasite}} mimics its own host. As with mimicry {{of the female}} sex outlined previously, only two species are involved, the model and mimic being of the same species. Brood parasitism, a form of kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism, is one such situation where host-parasite mimicry has evolved. Pasteur terms this form of aggressive-reproductive mimicry Kirbyan mimicry, after the English entomologist William Kirby.|$|E
5|$|Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> comedy {{radio show}} {{starring}} {{two of the}} Marx Brothers, Groucho and Chico, and written primarily by Nat Perrin and Arthur Sheekman. The series was originally broadcast in the United States on the National Broadcasting Company's Blue Network beginning November 28, 1932, and ended May 22, 1933. Sponsored by the Standard Oil Companies of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Louisiana and the Colonial Beacon Oil Company, it was the Monday night installment of the Five-Star Theater, an old-time radio variety series that offered a different program each weeknight. Episodes were broadcast live from NBC's WJZ station in New York City and later from a sound stage at RKO Pictures in Los Angeles, California, before returning to WJZ for the final episodes.|$|E

25|$|The New York Constitution {{states that}} {{whenever}} {{the governor is}} out of state, the lieutenant governor becomes acting governor. Since there was no clear line of succession, it was unclear who would have become acting governor, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> the Governor attempted to avoid.

25|$|The speed {{lines of}} gas turbine {{centrifugal}} compressors typically exhibit choke. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where the pressure ratio of a speed line drops rapidly (vertically) {{with little or}} no change in flow. In most cases {{the reason for this is}} that close to Mach 1 velocities have been reached somewhere within the impeller and/or diffuser generating a rapid increase in losses. Higher pressure ratio turbocharger centrifugal compressors exhibit this same phenomenon. Real choke phenomena is a function of compressibility as measured by the local Mach number within an area restriction within the centrifugal pressure stage.|$|E

25|$|Bimodal effect <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> that {{bacterial}} cell in an intermediate size range are consumed {{more rapidly than}} the very large or the very small. The bacteria, which are smaller than 0.5 μm in diameter, are grazed by protists four to six times less than larger cells. Moreover, the filamentous cells or cells with diameters greater than 3 μm are often too large to ingest by protists or are grazed at substantially lower rates than smaller bacteria. The specific effects vary with the size ratio between predator and prey. Pernthaler et al. classified susceptible bacteria into four groups by rough size.|$|E
25|$|Auditory pareidolia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> {{created when}} the brain {{incorrectly}} interprets random patterns as being familiar patterns. In {{the case of}} EVP it could result in an observer interpreting random noise on an audio recording as being the familiar sound of a human voice. The propensity for an apparent voice heard in white noise recordings {{to be in a}} language understood well by those researching it, rather than in an unfamiliar language, has been cited as evidence of this, and a broad class of phenomena referred to by author Joe Banks as Rorschach Audio {{has been described as a}} global explanation for all manifestations of EVP.|$|E
25|$|Stalemate <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> in {{the game}} of chess where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check but has no legal move. The rules of chess provide that when {{stalemate}} occurs, the game ends as a draw (i.e. having no winner). During the endgame, stalemate is a resource that can enable the player with the inferior position to draw the game rather than lose. In more complex positions, stalemate is much rarer, usually taking the form of a swindle that succeeds only if the superior side is inattentive. Stalemate is also a common theme in endgame studies and other chess problems.|$|E

His last production was Elektra by Richard Strauss, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen, shown at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in July 2013 and scheduled for the MET's 2015–16 season. A review noted: [...] "The clichés of Fascist brutality and expressionist exaggeration are astutely avoided: this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> that involves human beings, not caricatures, in a visually neutral environment of bare walls, windows and doors (designed by Richard Peduzzi) which is also blackly portentous in atmosphere." ...|$|E

500|$|Stanley Schmidt was an {{assistant}} professor of physics when he became editor of Analog, and his scientific background was well-suited to the magazine's readership. [...] He avoided making drastic changes, and continued the long-standing tradition of writing provocative editorials, though he rarely discussed science fiction. In 1979 he resurrected [...] "Probability Zero", a feature that Campbell had run in the early 1940s that published tall tales—humorous stories with ludicrous or impossible scientific premises. [...] Also in 1979 Schmidt began a series of columns titled [...] "The Alternate View", an opinion column that was written in alternate issues by G. Harry Stine and Jerry Pournelle, and which is still a feature of the magazine as of 2016, though now with different contributors. [...] The stable of fiction contributors remained largely unchanged from Bova's day, and included many names, such as Poul Anderson, Gordon R. Dickson, and George O. Smith, familiar to readers from the Campbell era. [...] This continuity led to criticisms within the field, Bruce Sterling writing in 1984 that the magazine [...] "has become old, dull, and drivelling... It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> screaming for reform. [...] Analog no longer permits itself to be read." [...] The magazine thrived nevertheless, and though part of the increase in circulation during the early 1980s may have been due to Davis Publications' energetic efforts to increase subscriptions, Schmidt knew what his readership wanted and made sure they got it, commenting in 1985: [...] "I reserve Analog for the kind of science fiction I've described here: good stories about people with problems in which some piece of plausible (or at least not demonstrably implausible) speculative science plays an indispensable role".|$|E
500|$|On 2 March 1714 Bach was {{appointed}} concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar.

[...] is the second cantata in this series, composed for the third Sunday after Easter, Jubilate, after , for Palm Sunday and Annunciation, and before , for Pentecost. The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from the First Epistle of Peter, [...] "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man" [...] (...) , and from the Gospel of John, Jesus announcing his second coming in the so-called Farewell Discourse, saying [...] "your sorrow shall be turned into joy" [...] (...) [...] The text, depicting the affliction that Christians have to pass, is assumed to {{have been written by}} Salomon Franck, the Weimar court poet who wrote most texts for Bach cantatas of the Weimar period. It follows details of the Gospel and the idea from the epistle reading: [...] "For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfull." [...] (verse 19). The text of the opening chorus corresponds to , the text of the first recitative is taken from , [...] "we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God". Franck contends that this is true not only for the disciples who were addressed directly, but for every Christian. Movement 4 sees the suffering of Jesus as a consolation for the afflicted Christian, movement 5 voices a decision to follow Jesus even in suffering, movement 6 offers the consolation that it will be only a short time until all sadness is overcome, alluding to (as in movement 4) [...] The cantata is closed by the sixth and final stanza of the hymn [...] "" [...] (1674) by Samuel Rodigast.
