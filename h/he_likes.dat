5|$|Kishimoto {{has noted}} that <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha's {{intelligent}} but abrasive personality. Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru {{if he were a}} girl, noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life. When designing Shikamaru's Part II appearance, Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series.

5|$|Lately, Cookie {{has also}} taught {{children}} {{the importance of}} eating a balanced diet. This doesn't mean that Cookie rounds out his diet with plates, trucks, ukuleles, and other objects the munching monster {{has been known to}} devour.

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>liked</b> {{the flame}} of her hair in the sunshine, the glint of its gold by the firelight, and the waywardness {{of it and the}} glory. <b>He</b> <b>liked</b> her neat-shod feet and the gray-gaitered calves,--alas, now hidden in long-skirted Dawson. <b>He</b> <b>liked</b> her for the {{strength}} of her slenderness; and to walk with her, swinging her step and stride to his, or to merely watch her come across a room or down the street, was a delight. Life and the joy of life romped through her blood, abstemiously filling out and rounding off each shapely muscle and soft curve. And <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> it all. Especially <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> the swell of her forearm, which rose firm and strong and tantalizing and sought shelter all too quickly under the loose-flowing sleeve.|$|R

6000|$|<b>Like</b> her! Yes! <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> her certainly. <b>He</b> had by {{no means}} always found that <b>he</b> best <b>liked</b> the {{companionship}} of his own order. <b>He</b> had <b>liked</b> to feel around him the free battle of the House of Commons. <b>He</b> <b>liked</b> the power of attack and defence in carrying on which an English politician cares nothing for rank. <b>He</b> <b>liked</b> {{to remember that the}} son of any tradesman might, by his own merits, become a peer of Parliament. <b>He</b> would have <b>liked</b> to think that his son should share all these tastes with him. Yes,--he liked Isabel Boncassen. But how different was that liking from a desire that she should be bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh! ...|$|R

5|$|The comedian {{has said}} that <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> playing weak characters, and {{particularly}} revealing weaknesses in high status figures. During {{the course of the}} show, he will frequently peel back the Colbert character's apparent bravado to expose a very weak inner core. In one instance, Colbert demands one of his staff members subject him to simulated waterboarding, only to break down into pleas for mercy upon hearing a water bottle cap popped. In another episode, he criticizes The Today Show cohost Matt Lauer for saying that it's unacceptable for men to cry, only to sob hysterically upon learning that Katie Couric has left the show. These status shifts occur commonly, and constitute a central component of the show's comedy.|$|E

Along the way, he listens to a classic rock radio station and is shocked to discover {{that all of the}} kids hate it.

When she says that a pack of Morleys is already there and leaves, Mulder opens it and finds the Cigarette Smoking Man's address inside. Mulder bursts into the Cigarette Smoking Man's home and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know why Scully was taken instead of him. The Cigarette Smoking Man claims <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> the both of them, which is why she was returned; he reveals that he told Skinner it was Mulder who shot {{the man in the}} parking lot, although he didn't believe this to be true, incidentally revealing himself as unaware of who did shoot the man, namely X. He tells Mulder that he'll never know the truth if he kills him, and Mulder decides not to.|$|E

60|$|John {{answered}} {{her with a}} pleasant smile. <b>He</b> <b>liked</b> the Next Neighbor. <b>He</b> <b>liked</b> the kind of mind she had, for it was thoroughly imbued with an anxious desire to do her duty in this world {{in the manner in}} which that duty showed itself to her. <b>He</b> <b>liked</b> her because she was fond of the Daughter of the House. <b>He</b> <b>liked</b> her because she considered her husband to be the handsomest, best, and cleverest man in the world. Perhaps John would have liked this trait best of all if he had not clearly seen that she held in reserve an opinion that this husband would move on a still higher plane if he would place more value on her opinions and statements.|$|R
