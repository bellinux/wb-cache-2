5|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews.

5|$|After a long {{absence from}} politics, Marshall {{was called to}} one final act of public service. Upon the death of Martin D. Hardin who had been elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1823 but died before he could take office, Marshall pursued an {{abbreviated}} campaign for the vacant seat and defeated Jeptha Dudley {{by a margin of}} 3 votes. The primary issue of the <b>day</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Old Court – New Court controversy, an attempt by the legislature to abolish the extant Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} new court in retaliation for overturning a replevin law passed in a previous legislative session. Marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election by virtue of his support for the Old Court, which was the prevailing sentiment in his district. His actions in the session, however, appear to have been unremarkable, and he did not seek reelection at the end of his term.|$|E
5|$|Contador {{continued}} to be troubled by his injury during stage 8, which finished on the climb of the Campitello Matese. The stage was won by Beñat Intxausti (Movistar), {{who was in the}} day's early breakaway and attacked on the final climb. Astana again rode hard to put pressure on the other riders; eventually a group formed of Contador, Aru, Porte and Landa. Landa then attacked and finished second on the stage, 15 seconds ahead of the other three riders. He therefore moved up into fifth place overall, while Contador increased his lead over Aru by winning bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint. Stage 9 was also won by a rider from a breakaway: Paolo Tiralongo (Astana) took a solo victory. Aru, Contador, Porte and Landa were again alone in a group {{towards the end of the}} stage; although they came to the finish together, Aru took a second out of the others in the sprint. This moved him to three seconds behind Contador. The following <b>day</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first rest day of the race.|$|E
5|$|Die Another Day had {{its world}} premiere on 18 November 2002 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of honour, {{making it the}} second Bond film premiere to be {{attended}} by the Queen, the first one being You Only Live Twice in 1967. The Royal Albert Hall had a make-over for the screening and had been transformed into an ice palace. Proceeds from the première, about £500,000, were donated to the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund of which the Queen is patron. On the first day, ticket sales reached £1.2 million. Die Another <b>Day</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> highest grossing James Bond film until the release of Casino Royale. It earned $432 million worldwide, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2002.|$|E

5|$|The {{breakaway}} {{was eventually}} caught {{at the bottom}} of the final climb. Valverde, who had crashed earlier in the <b>day,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first to attack. As soon as he was caught, his teammate Nairo Quintana put in his own attack. These attacks dropped Chris Froome from the front group. Dumoulin was the next to attack, seeking to take back the race lead from Chaves. Chaves and Quintana initially followed him, but were soon dropped. Valverde was also unable to follow the pace, but Froome had kept a steady pace and by this point was leading the chase of Dumoulin.|$|E
5|$|The first studio scene—Donna in {{the fortune}} teller's room—was filmed on 30 November 2007, on a redressed Torchwood Hub {{set at the}} show's Upper Boat Studios. The outdoor scenes in Shan Shen—comprising Tennant's entire {{contribution}} to the episode—were filmed on 1 December 2007 in Splott and near the Cardiff Royal Infirmary. The shoot was marred by difficulties: rain delayed redressing the alley from the hanzi banners and posters to the Bad Wolf versions; and several extras left at lunchtime because of a misunderstanding over their payment. The final scene filmed on the <b>day</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Doctor's examination of the Time Beetle in the fortune teller's room. The scenes in the country hotel were filmed at Egerton Grey Country House Hotel in Porthkerry on 3 December 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{most popular}} of these among the wealthy {{patrons of the}} <b>day</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> four-volume Vitruvius Britannicus by Colen Campbell. Campbell was both an {{architect}} and a publisher. The book was basically a book of design containing architectural prints of British buildings, which had been inspired by the great architects from Vitruvius to Palladio; at first mainly those of Inigo Jones, but the later tomes contained drawings and plans by Campbell and other 18th-century architects. These four books greatly contributed to Palladian architecture becoming established in 18th-century Britain. Their three authors became the most fashionable and sought after architects of the era. Due to his book Vitruvius Britannicus, Colen Campbell {{was chosen as the}} architect for banker Henry Hoare I's Stourhead house (illustration above), a masterpiece that became the inspiration for dozens of similar houses across England.|$|E

5|$|The sixteenth saw {{no major}} {{shifts in the}} general {{classification}}. The top five riders in the general classification formed a leading group on the final climb {{but there were no}} major moves to create time gaps. Lelli took the stage win after ahead of Bugno. The following <b>day</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> last in the Dolomites and saw the ascension of five major climbs, including the Cima Coppi Passo Pordoi. On the second climbing of Pordoi, Chioccioli attacked and rode {{to the top of the}} climb to win the stage by thirty-eight seconds. Lejaretta crashed on the day and lost over six and a half minutes, putting him out of contention for the podium and overall victory. Midway through the stage, Fignon abandoned the race. The eighteenth day of racing was a transition stage. Several attempts were made to form a breakaway group before a group of eight were successful in creating a gap. The group was caught with five hundred meters to go by the chasing peloton which was setting up for a field sprint. Silvio Martinello managed to outsprint the likes of Cipollini and Abdoujaparov to win the day.|$|E
5|$|In Serbia, {{the period}} between 1889 and 1914 was marked by a spate of {{patriotic}} literature, theatre and visual art. Serbian artists competed with one another over who would produce the best depictions of Serbia's medieval history, and the best Serbian national romantic art was made during this time. One {{of the most prominent}} Serb artists of the <b>day</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> realist Paja Jovanović, who was known for his sprawling historical works. In 1899, the special committee hired him to compose a scene depicting Dušan's coronation to be displayed in Paris. In return for his services, he received an honorarium of 30,000 dinars. The government felt it was essential that Jovanović's work and those of other Serbian artists be well received. Given decades of political instability in the Balkans, the authorities sought to promote a positive image of their country abroad, especially by familiarizing Western Europeans with Serbian art. Hence, Jovanović was painting for a dual audience, both domestic and foreign. His foremost goal was to emphasize the legitimacy of Serbia's contemporary territorial claims before the Great Powers, especially with regard to Kosovo, Macedonia and the Sandžak (then divided between the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary), and counter any negative views of the Serbian state. For his domestic audience, Jovanović's goal was to remind his countrymen of Serbia's rich history and encourage patriotic sentiments. After consulting with the politician and historian Stojan Novaković, Jovanović decided against painting a scene from Dušan's coronation, and opted to depict the proclamation of Dušan's Code instead. As a result, the painting is sometimes mistakenly referred to as The Coronation of Tsar Dušan (Serbian: Krunisanje Cara Dušana).|$|E
