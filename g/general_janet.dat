5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{discovery}} of the Watkins memo, and based upon a suggestion from the Office of Independent Counsel, on March 20, 1996, Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno requested that Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr expand his inquiry to specifically include the travel office affair, in particular allegations that White House employees had lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the firings, and that David Watkins or Hillary Clinton had made false statements in previous testimony to the GAO, Congress, or the Independent Counsel.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Carl Williams, the {{superintendent}} of the New Jersey State Police, {{wrote a letter to}} Pope John Paul II asking him to raise the issue of Shakur's extradition during his talks with President Fidel Castro. During the pope's visit to Cuba in 1998, Shakur agreed to an interview with NBC journalist Ralph Penza. Shakur later published an extensive criticism of the NBC segment, which inter-spliced footage of Trooper Foerster's grieving widow with an FBI photo connected to a bank robbery of which Shakur had been acquitted. On March 10, 1998 New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman asked Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno to do whatever it would take to return Shakur from Cuba. Later in 1998, U.S. media widely reported claims that the United States State Department had offered to lift the Cuban embargo in exchange for the return of 90U.S. refugees, including Shakur.|$|E

The FBI eventually published a major report on school shooters, {{though it did}} not pinpoint the causes of any individual case.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the limited {{educational}} opportunities open to women, Janet became an active supporter of the movement for higher education provision for women. In 1877 Janet was appointed as the honorary secretary of the new Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women, founded by Jessie Campbell and financed by Isabella Elder. John Caird, principal of Glasgow University at the time, was the first Chairman of its <b>General</b> Committee. <b>Janet</b> was responsible for recruiting teachers lecturers and examiners, and helped to develop and plan teaching methods and standards.|$|R

Holder was confirmed several months later in the Senate by a unanimous vote. During his confirmation hearing, Holder's opposition {{to the death penalty}} was questioned, but he pledged his intention to cooperate with the current laws and Reno, saying, [...] "I am not a proponent of the death penalty, but I will enforce the law as this Congress gives it to us." [...] Holder was the first African-American to serve in that position.|$|R
50|$|In {{the winter}} of 2014, Journal made several {{management}} changes to split responsibilities between its radio and television division. Some of the changes included the appointments of Debbie Turner (executive {{vice president and general}} manager at WTVF) as the company's vice president of television, Steve Wexler (executive vice president of Journal's Milwaukee radio and television properties) as executive vice president for the company's radio division, and Joe Poss (general manager of Journal's Green Bay duopoly of WGBA/WACY) as WTMJ-TV's <b>general</b> manager. <b>Janet</b> Hundley (longtime assistant news director at ABC owned-and-operated station WLS-TV in Chicago) was also hired as the station's news director in May 2014, following the resignation of Bill Berra.|$|R

25|$|In May 1998, Blumenthal, {{along with}} {{attorneys}} general from 19 {{other states and}} the District of Columbia, filed an anti-trust lawsuit against Microsoft accusing the company of abusing its monopoly power to stifle competition. The suit, which centered on Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system and the company's contractual restrictions imposed on personal computer manufacturers to tie the operating system to its Internet Explorer browser, was eventually merged with a federal case brought by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) under Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno.|$|E
25|$|Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno {{ordered the}} return of Elián González to his father and set a {{deadline}} of April 13, 2000, but the Miami relatives defied the order. Negotiations continued for several days as the house was surrounded by protesters as well as police. The relatives insisted on guarantees that they could live with the child for several months and retain custody, and that González would not be returned to Cuba. Negotiations carried on throughout the night, but Reno claimed that the relatives rejected all workable solutions.|$|E
50|$|Designed by John Sydney Swan {{and built}} in 1904-6, The Convent of the Sacred Heart, a Catholic girls' {{boarding}} school, was renamed Erskine College {{in the late}} 1960s after the former Superior <b>General</b> Mother <b>Janet</b> Erskine Stuart. The adjacent Erskine Chapel of the Sacred Heart, also designed by John Sydney Swan, was built in 1930 in the French Gothic style. Erskine Chapel is considered {{to have one of}} the finest chapel interiors in New Zealand, and is listed as Category I in New Zealand's Historic Places Trust. The school closed in 1985 and today the complex is privately owned. Erskine College was used as a location in Peter Jackson's 1996 film The Frighteners. The chapel was refurbished in 2003, and is now a popular venue for weddings and concerts.|$|R
50|$|The {{constituency}} {{was formed}} in 1885. Burton-upon-Trent is a centre of the brewing industry and from the seat's creation in 1885 until 1945, the MPs were members of brewery-owning families. From 1950 until 1997, the seat was held by the Conservative Party. However, like many traditionally Conservative seats, it fell to the Labour Party during their landslide victory at the 1997 <b>general</b> election. Labour's <b>Janet</b> Dean held the seat until 2010 when the Tories retook the seat.|$|R
5000|$|Society for Psychical Research members Maurice Grosse and Guy Lyon Playfair {{reported}} [...] "curious whistling and barking noises {{coming from}} <b>Janet’s</b> <b>general</b> direction." [...] Although Playfair maintained the haunting was genuine and {{wrote in his}} later book This House is Haunted: The True Story of a Poltergeist (1980) that an [...] "entity" [...] was {{to blame for the}} disturbances, he often doubted the children's veracity and wondered if they were playing tricks and exaggerating. Still, Grosse and Playfair believed that even though some of the alleged poltergeist activity was faked by the girls, other incidents were genuine. Janet was detected in trickery; a video camera in the room next door caught her bending spoons and attempting to bend an iron bar. Grosse had observed Janet banging a broom handle on the ceiling and hiding his tape-recorder. Ventriloquist Ray Alan thought Janet's male voices were simply vocal tricks. According to Playfair, one of Janet’s voices she called [...] "Bill" [...] displayed a [...] "habit of suddenly changing the topic - it was a habit Janet also had".|$|R
25|$|Inslaw {{is known}} for {{developing}} Promis, an early case management software system. It is also known for a lawsuit that it brought against the United States Department of Justice in 1986 over Promis. Inslaw won damages in bankruptcy court, but these were overturned on appeal. The suit resulted in several Justice Department internal reviews, two Congressional investigations, {{the appointment of a}} special counsel by Attorney General William P. Barr, and a lengthy review of the special counsel's report under Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno. Inslaw's claims were finally referred by Congress to the Court of Federal Claims in 1995, and the dispute ended with the Court's ruling against Inslaw in 1998.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 an Immigration Judge {{agreed not}} to send Fidel Armando-Alfanso back to Cuba, based on his {{membership}} in a particular social group (gay people) who were persecuted and feared further persecution {{by the government of}} Cuba. The Board of Immigration Appeals upheld the decision in 1990, and in 1994, then-Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno ordered this decision to be a legal precedent binding on Immigration Judges and the Asylum Office, and established sexual orientation as a grounds for asylum. However, in 2002 the Board of Immigration Appeals “suggested in an ambiguous and internally inconsistent decision that the ‘protected characteristic’ and ‘social visibility’ tests may represent dual requirements in all social group cases.” The requirement for social visibility means that the government of a country from which the person seeking asylum is fleeing must recognize their social group, and that LGBT people who hide their sexual orientation, for example out of fear of persecution, may not be eligible for asylum under this mandate.|$|E
500|$|Several politicians, {{including}} US Representative Bobby Rush, {{requested that}} State's Attorney Richard A. Devine seek new trials for the Death Row 10 who were allegedly tortured by Burge into making coerced [...] confessions. Devine met with representatives {{and supporters of}} the inmates and was convinced to request that the Illinois Supreme Court stay proceedings against three of the inmates. [...] However, the Illinois Supreme Court denied Devine's request. [...] Rush also sought out Attorney [...] <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno to pursue federal intervention.|$|E
6000|$|In the <b>general</b> confusion, <b>Janet</b> regained her lady's chamber unobserved, {{trembling}} like an aspen leaf, {{but determined}} to keep secret from the Countess the dreadful surmises which she could not help entertaining from the drunken ravings of Lambourne. Her fears, however, though they assumed no certain shape, kept pace with {{the advice of the}} pedlar; and she confirmed her mistress in her purpose of taking the medicine which he had recommended, from which it is probable she would otherwise have dissuaded her. Neither had these intimations escaped the ears of Wayland, who knew much better how to interpret them. He felt much compassion at beholding so lovely a creature as the Countess, and whom he had first seen in the bosom of domestic happiness, exposed to the machinations of such a gang of villains. His indignation, too, had been highly excited by hearing the voice of his old master, against whom he felt, in equal degree, the passions of hatred and fear. He nourished also a pride in his own art and resources; and, dangerous as the task was, he that night formed a determination to attain the bottom of the mystery, and to aid the distressed lady, if it were yet possible. From some words which Lambourne had dropped among his ravings, Wayland now, for the first time, felt inclined to doubt that Varney had acted entirely on his own account in wooing and winning the affections of this beautiful creature. Fame asserted of this zealous retainer that he had accommodated his lord in former love intrigues; and it occurred to Wayland Smith that Leicester himself might be the party chiefly interested. Her marriage with the Earl he could not suspect; but even the discovery of such a passing intrigue with a lady of Mistress Amy Robsart's rank was a secret of the deepest importance to the stability of the favourite's power over Elizabeth. [...] "If Leicester himself should hesitate to stifle such a rumour by very strange means," [...] said he to himself, [...] "he has those about him who would do him that favour without waiting for his consent. If I would meddle in this business, it must be in such guise as my old master uses when he compounds his manna of Satan, and that is with a close mask on my face. So I will quit Giles Gosling to-morrow, and change my course and place of residence as often as a hunted fox. I should like to see this little Puritan, too, once more. She looks both pretty and intelligent to have come of such a caitiff as Anthony Fire-the-Fagot." ...|$|R
5000|$|Manga Critic's Katherine Dacey {{writes that}} the manga's [...] "visual style and subject matter may not strike {{contemporary}} readers as manga-esque ... but the intimate quality of the stories will leave as lasting an impression as graphic memoirs such as Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis and Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home." [...] TIME's Andrew Arnold praises the manga as [...] "a book to be enjoyed by readers of history and comix, this once-lost artifact works as both a delightful read and a reminder of where Americans come from and who we are now." [...] Jason Thompson {{writes that the}} manga is [...] "frozen in time with diligent documentary-style realism, with cynical humor and cartoony cheer". Shaenon K. Garrity applauds the manga as a [...] "historical artifact and a milestone {{in the evolution of}} comics" [...] and says Schodt's translation provides [...] "historical background and explains all the untranslatable puns".Harvard Asia Pacific Review commends Kiyama's [...] "keen insight into the workings of society, especially into Japanese-American interaction." [...] Booklist's Gordon Flagg comments that the manga is [...] "a fascinating cultural document of an era of great interest to scholars of Asian American culture. Since it is apparently the first U.S. comic book consisting of original material instead of reprinted newspaper strips, it is also of interest to students of American comics. Writing for American Studies International, Robert Humphrey commends Kiyama [...] "gentle humor that appeals to readers of all cultures" [...] as [...] "his cartoons are not only informative about their own time period, they remain funny in ours". Michael Boatwright, writing for the Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy, comments on Kiyama's emphasis on the characters' [...] "cartoon-like features" [...] with the usage of [...] "simplistic lines and circles", which [...] "readers to identify more readily with characters." [...] Kom Kunyosying draws a parallel between the manga and Mikhail Bakhtin's essay Epic and Novel as they are both [...] "anti-genre", which [...] "achieves much of what other forms cannot, including an ability to engage with contemporary reality, and an ability to re-conceptualize the individual in a complex way that interrogates his subjectivity and offers the possibility of redefining his own image." [...] Brian Hayashi criticizes the manga for its [...] "strong upper-class bias" [...] and that Schodt did not account for the difference in treatment of Japanese students and Japanese immigrants in <b>general.</b> AnimeFringe's <b>Janet</b> Houck commends the characters for not being [...] "depressive" [...] and for bringing [...] "their own unique spin on how to be successful in California, from farming rice to investing in banks to gambling." [...] Jeff Chon of Sequart comments that the manga [...] "isn’t just a shared piece of history between comics fans, but a bit of cultural and personal history we as Americans need to share more often." ...|$|R
500|$|ASL is {{distinguished}} by its requirement that all second-year students complete a mandatory Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) class. [...] The school has also held ADR training in local schools; this program drew national attention, particularly from former U.S. Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno, who has publicly congratulated the school on this effort. Students are given {{an overview of}} different types of conflict resolutions, particularly mediation, negotiation, and arbitration. Ethical issues are explored in addition to legal and policy ramifications. Students learn {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each method of dispute resolution and learn which methods are appropriate for certain situations.|$|E
500|$|On June 18, 1996, Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno {{asked the}} FBI {{to look into}} it; FBI Director Louis Freeh {{acknowledged}} that both the FBI and especially the White House had committed [...] "egregious violations of privacy" [...] (in some cases the background reports contained information about extramarital affairs, trangressions with the law, and medical issues). On June 21 Reno decided it was {{a conflict of interest}} for the U.S. Department of Justice to further investigate the matter, and thus recommended that it be folded into the overall umbrella of the Whitewater investigations, under charge of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. In any case, Starr had already begun looking into it.|$|E
500|$|There was {{controversy}} as {{to whether}} the document should be published, but the Department of Justice headed by Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno, along with FBI Director Louis Freeh, recommended publication out of concern for public safety and in hopes that a reader could identify the author. Bob Guccione of Penthouse volunteered to publish it, but Kaczynski replied that, since Penthouse was less [...] "respectable" [...] than the other publications, he would in that case [...] "reserve the right to plant one (and only one) bomb intended to kill, after our manuscript has been published." [...] The pamphlet was published by The New York Times and The Washington Post on September 19, 1995. Penthouse never published it.|$|E
500|$|President Bill Clinton {{nominated}} {{her as an}} Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on June 14, 1993, to {{fill the}} seat vacated by retiring Justice Byron White. Ginsburg was recommended to Clinton by then-U.S. Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno after a suggestion by Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch. At {{the time of her}} nomination, Ginsburg was viewed as a moderate. President Clinton was reportedly looking to increase the Court's diversity, which Ginsburg did as the first Jewish justice since the 1969 resignation of Justice Abe Fortas and as only the second female appointee. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Ginsburg as [...] "well qualified", its highest possible rating for a prospective justice.|$|E
500|$|Kaczynski was {{the target}} of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) longest and costliest investigation. Before his {{identity}} was known, the FBI used the title [...] "UNABOM" [...] (UNiversity & Airline BOMber) to refer to his case, which resulted in the media calling him the Unabomber. The FBI (as well as Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno) pushed for the publication of Kaczynski's manifesto, which led to his sister-in-law, and then his brother, recognizing Kaczynski's style of writing and beliefs from the manifesto, and tipping off the FBI. After his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wanted to plead insanity {{in order to avoid the}} death penalty, as he did not believe he was insane. In 1998 a plea bargain was reached, under which Kaczynski pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.|$|E
500|$|National Security Advisor Sandy Berger called President Bill Clinton at 5:35 AM on August 7 {{to notify}} {{him of the}} bombings. That day, Clinton started meeting with his [...] "Small Group" [...] of {{national}} security advisers, which included Berger, CIA director George Tenet, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno, Defense Secretary William Cohen, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Hugh Shelton. The group's objective was to plan a military response to the East Africa embassy bombings. Based on electronic and phone intercepts, physical evidence from Nairobi, and interrogations, officials soon suspected bin Laden as the perpetrator of the attacks. On August 8, the White House asked the CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to prepare a targets list; the initial list included twenty targets in Sudan, Afghanistan, and an unknown third country, although it was narrowed down on August 12.|$|E
500|$|Ramsey Clark wrote {{a letter}} in 1995 to then-Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno {{in which he said}} that the case {{involved}} [...] "a broader range of deliberate and systematic misconduct and abuse of power {{over a longer period of}} time in an effort to destroy a political movement and leader, than any other federal prosecution in my time or to my knowledge". He asserted that, [...] "The government, ex parte, sought and received an order effectively closing the doors of these publishing businesses, all of which were involved in First Amendment activities, effectively preventing the further repayment of their debts." [...] He called the convictions [...] "a tragic miscarriage of justice which at this time can only be corrected by an objective review and courageous action by the Department of Justice". The LaRouche movement organized two panels to review the cases: the Curtis Clark Commission, and the Mann-Chestnut hearings.|$|E
500|$|Also on Patton's {{agenda was}} a reformation of Kentucky's {{juvenile}} justice system. Under Brereton Jones, {{because of its}} system of housing and treating juvenile offenders, Kentucky {{had been one of}} only two states unable to qualify for federal grants. Among the problems cited by the Department of Justice were abuse of juveniles by state employees, and failure to hold juvenile and adult offenders separately from each other. Governor Jones entered into a consent decree to ameliorate the situation, but his term expired before he could meaningfully address the terms of the decree. Patton went beyond the terms of the [...] decree by implementing mandatory training for state employees who dealt with juvenile offenders, and by setting up a hotline for juveniles to report abuse anonymously. He shifted the responsibility for housing juveniles from local communities to the state, constructing nine new juvenile detention centers. In January 2001, Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno proclaimed Kentucky's juvenile justice system a model for the nation.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Schneider left Scripps-Howard to join The Oregonian in Portland, Oregon. The {{following}} year, {{he moved}} to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer (P-I), beginning the first of two stints at the paper that would last six years in total. His first major assignment at the P-I was a five-month investigation of child abuse prosecutions in Wenatchee, Washington with Mike Barber in 1998. Their findings, published in the five-part series [...] "The Power to Harm", uncovered false confessions from child witnesses and other abuses by authorities in the wrongful arrests of 43 adults, some of whom would be convicted and sentenced to prison. The newspaper's investigation led to the establishment of Innocence Project Northwest, which overturned or reduced the case's 18 verdicts, freeing all of the defendants by the end of 2000; it also convinced U.S. Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno to review the cases on alleged wrongdoing by police, prosecutors and social workers. Nat Hentoff of The Village Voice argued that the investigation [...] "deserve to win the Pulitzer Prize" [...] for its influence on Reno's decision and the overturning of convictions.|$|E
500|$|Politics {{dominated}} {{network news}} in 1992. Jennings moderated the final debate among the Democratic presidential candidates in March, and anchored Peter Jennings Reporting: Who Is Ross Perot? and a subsequent 90-minute town forum with Perot and a studio audience in June. On September 9, 1992, ABC {{announced that it}} would be switching the format of its political coverage to give less recognition to staged sound bites. [...] "We're aware that a lot of you are turned off by the political process and that many of you put {{at least some of the}} blame on us," [...] Jennings told viewers on World News Tonight. [...] "We'll only devote time to a candidate's daily routine if it is more than routine. There will be less attention to staged appearances and sound bites designed exclusively for television." [...] After Bill Clinton was elected as president in November 1992, Jennings featured the new administration in two of his specials for children; he anchored President Clinton: Answering Children's Questions in February 1993; and Kids in the Crossfire: Violence in America in November 1993, a live special from a Washington, D.C. junior high school which featured Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno and rapper MC Lyte.|$|E
500|$|On 13 November 1996 the day {{the first}} subpoenaed USAF officer was {{scheduled}} to appear, the DoD delivered a letter to Roth, signed by its general counsel, Judith Miller, stating that the DoD believed the subpoenas were invalid because they were issued [...] "after the adjournment of sine die of the 104th Congress" [...] and was therefore not going to honor the subpoenas by providing the four officers for interview. Roth replied to the DoD that only the Senate's legal counsel could determine the validity of congressional subpoenas because of the [...] "separation of powers" [...] principle in the U.S. Constitution and thus, the subpoenas were valid. The DoD, on 20 November in another letter signed by Miller again refused to produce the witnesses. Roth, whose committee chairmanship was scheduled to end the next month, {{was told by the}} U.S. Department of Justice that the U.S. Attorney <b>General,</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno, would not support him if he chose to take the dispute with the DoD to court. Also, many of Roth's senate colleagues, including John McCain, were asking him to [...] "back off". Thus, Roth decided to drop the matter and continue preparing the report without the testimony of Santarelli, Dallager, Starr, and Mangin. For the first time in U.S. history, the DoD had refused to comply with a U.S. Senate subpoena.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised {{there was nothing wrong with}} that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.|$|E
