5|$|Provisions {{were now}} running low, {{and with the}} rescue mission overdue, Maxwell began formulating a plan to capture {{sufficient}} proas {{to escape from the}} island. While the plan was being proposed a sail was spotted on the horizon, <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> island. The appearance of this vessel, coupled with a sudden attack spearheaded by Alceste's marines, caused the pirates to flee. The rescue ship was Ternate, a 16-gun brig belonging to the British East India Company's navy, the Bombay Marine, despatched by Lord Amherst on the day of his arrival in Batavia.|$|E
5|$|It {{originated}} {{in an area}} of low pressure that developed over the western Gulf of Mexico on December10, downstream from an upper-level cyclone. The surface low tracked northward to Oklahoma before turning eastward as it gradually intensified. Simultaneously, a shortwave trough swung southeastward around the periphery of a large vortex over central and eastern Canada. As the upper low opened up into a negatively tilted trough and began to interact with the northern wave, a secondary surface cyclone developed along a frontal boundary over South Carolina late on December11. Almost immediately thereafter, the original low dissipated over West Virginia. <b>Heading</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northeast, the incipient storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, at 00:00UTC on December12.|$|E
5|$|The first Ju 88s {{took off}} at 23:00 and began <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Dutch coast where they dived to sea level and stayed at {{approximately}} 50 metres while they flew out to sea. Crews {{were forbidden to}} engage enemy aircraft over the North Sea {{in order to preserve}} surprise until the last possible moment. The rain and squall assisted crews in judging the location and distance of the water. However, with crews prone to human error, it was decided to use the very accurate FuG 101 radar altimeter and the Ju 88s blind-flying instruments. The strain on the crews was enormous, as a careful vigil was kept on them until the British coast was reached and the pilot began his ascent to the height of the returning bomber stream. As they did so, the Ju 88s released Düppel to obscure the radar of Mosquito fighters. The pilots were then free to begin their attacks.|$|E

5|$|The {{first part}} of the Baltimore Beltway to be {{completed}} was in December 1955 between MD 25 (Falls Road) and the Harrisburg Expressway (present-day I-83). In 1956, the next portion of the road between the Harrisburg Expressway and MD 45 (York Road) opened. Several more segments of the Baltimore Beltway would be built in the following years, with the section from MD 168 (Nursery Road) to the Glen Burnie Bypass (present-day I-97) opening in 1957; the portions from MD 45 to MD 542 (Loch Raven Boulevard), MD 7 (Old Philadelphia Road) to US 40 (Pulaski Highway), and from MD 168 to US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) opening in 1958; the segment from MD 2 (Ritchie Highway) to the Glen Burnie Bypass completed in 1960; the portion from US 1 (Belair Road) to MD 7 finished in 1961; and the portions from MD 542 to US 1 and from US 40 to MD 25 finished in 1962. At this time, the original length of the Baltimore Beltway, from MD 2 in the south clockwise to US 40 in the northeast, was fully completed and opened to traffic, providing the first Interstate-grade bypass of Baltimore and the first beltway in the United States built under the Interstate Highway System. A segment of the road completed in 1973 ran from MD 10 to MD 2, <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Outer Harbor Crossing.|$|E

25|$|Al-Mu'tazz's brother Abu Ahmad was put {{in charge}} of the Samarran forces at the {{beginning}} of the war. He was charged by the caliph with defeating al-Musta'in and Muhammad b. 'Abdallah, and was given the authority to command the army in any manner he pleased. Abu Ahmad's overall strategy was to keep Baghdad under constant attack from his troops, and to gain the surrender of the city by either assaulting it or starving its inhabitants until they lost the will to fight any longer. Toward this end, al-Mu'tazz sent armies to secure the neighboring towns that controlled access to Baghdad, and Abu Ahmad attempted to halt and seize any revenue shipments <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> city. The way in which Abu Ahmad ran the siege was not unquestionably accepted by al-Mu'tazz, who reportedly wrote him a letter in the middle of the war complaining of his lack of progress in forcing al-Musta'in's capitulation, but he remained in command of the main besieging force throughout the entire conflict.|$|E
25|$|Games 4 and 5 {{were the}} most {{controversial}} of the series. The Spurs, after being comfortably in control of game 4, saw their 11-point fourth quarter lead dwindle away, to a 2-point Suns lead. With 18 seconds left, Robert Horry bodychecked Steve Nash in which he threw his arms in the air, into the scorers table. Nash's teammates jumped to his defense; during the ensuing altercation, Stoudemire and Boris Diaw left the bench <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> altercation. Their action violated NBA rules, resulting in the decision by league commissioner David Stern to suspend both players for game 5 (Horry was also suspended two games for his flagrant foul against Nash). In game 5, played in Phoenix, the short-handed Suns jumped out early and enjoyed a 16-point lead on the Spurs, but in a reversal of game 4, this time the Spurs came back {{in the final seconds}} and won the game 88–85, giving San Antonio a 3–2 series lead.|$|E
25|$|Yorktown {{remained}} at Ulithi arming, provisioning, and conducting upkeep until 10 February. At that time, she sortied with TF 58, the 3rd Fleet becoming the 5th Fleet when Raymond A. Spruance relieved William Halsey, Jr., {{on a series}} of raids on the Japanese and thence to support the assault on and occupation of Iwo Jima. On the morning of 16 February, the carrier began launching strikes on the Tokyo area of Honshū. On 17 February, she repeated those strikes before <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Bonins. Her aviators bombed and strafed installations on Chichi Jima on 18 February. The landings on Iwo Jima went forward on 19 February, and Yorktown aircraft began support missions over the island on 20 February. Those missions continued until 23 February at which time Yorktown cleared the Bonins to resume strikes on Japan proper. She arrived at the launch point on 25 February and sent two raids aloft to bomb and strafe airfields in the vicinity of Tokyo. On 26 February, Yorktown aircrewmen conducted a single sweep of installations on Kyūshū before TG 58.4 began its retirement to Ulithi. Yorktown re-entered the anchorage at Ulithi on 1 March.|$|E

500|$|The {{station is}} {{the only one in the}} New York City Subway to serve trains in a single direction.

[...] Thus, it can only be served by northbound trains heading toward Brooklyn and Manhattan. Southbound trains <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Rockaways are unable to stop at the station, and as a result, it is not directly accessible from Manhattan and Brooklyn. However, in the past, southbound trains would terminate at this station by using a crossover located to the north of the station. This station was originally advertised as [...] "open on racing days", but some trains stopped here regardless of the time of day; riders could not always exit the station, depending on whether the racetrack was open.|$|E

500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the people on both sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Heading</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{twilight}} of his career, Lee enjoyed a batting renaissance in 1928 and 1929. He averaged over 35 in each season, and scored runs heavily, reaching 1,715 {{runs in the}} first year and 1,995 in the second, the most in any season of his career. For the only time in his career, Lee was selected in 1928 to play for the professional [...] "Players" [...] team in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixture. Appearing in the contest at The Oval in early June, he opened the batting and scored 56 runs. The match finished as a draw with the final day lost to rain. In 1929, he scored a century in each innings of a match for the second time, making 124 and 105 not out against a strong Lancashire bowling attack. Later that season, he scored his third and final double century, scoring 225 runs against Surrey at The Oval, during which he shared a second wicket partnership of 319 with Gubby Allen. Lee's 1,617 runs for Middlesex in the County Championship in 1929 made him their leading run-scorer, although both Hearne and Hendren topped 1,000 runs with superior averages. The following season saw Lee accumulate 1,485 first-class runs at an average of 26.05, in the season which saw him play more matches than in any other: 34 in total. He reached a century only once, scoring 150 runs against Somerset at Taunton.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} notable for {{featuring}} the first actual kiss between Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. The series had featured other brushes with kisses {{between the two}} leads: in the fourth season episode [...] "Small Potatoes", a shapeshifter, disguised as Mulder, nearly kissed Scully; in the 1998 film, the two's [...] "lips brushed slightly before Scully got stung by a virus-carrying bee"; and in the sixth season entry [...] "Triangle", Mulder kissed a Scully-lookalike from the 1930s in a reverie of his. John Shiban developed {{the idea for a}} Mulder–Scully kiss, which was described by series creator Chris Carter as a [...] "present for the fans." [...] Shiban noted that the episode's kiss felt like [...] "the logical culmination of their relationship. They had been <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> kiss for years". Gillian Anderson later explained that, [...] "David [...] and I knew the kiss was coming. [...] I felt the editors of that episode milked it in a very effective way." [...] In order to create the atmosphere of the scene, specialized camera angles were used and everything was slowed down to make the scene last longer. The Millennium Ball scene was digitally created on a computer because the episode was filmed in October, two months before the event was scheduled to take place. Special effects producer Bill Millar was tasked with digitally adding the number [...] "2000" [...] into archival footage of Dick Clark's 1999 New Years Eve show. Dick Clark was later hired to come in and create a voice-over bit announcing the year 2000.|$|E
