Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} the interoperability of trajectory-based automation concepts and technologies with modern Flight Management Systems and datalink communication to enable negotiation between air and ground. A two-way datalink connection between the trajectory-based automation resident in the Center/TRACON Automation System and the Future Air Navigation System- 1 integrated Flight Management System/datalink in NASA Ames ’ B 747 - 400 Level D simulator has been established. Simulation experiments investigated the use of datalink messages to communicate strategic trajectories. A strategic trajectory is defined as an aircraft deviation needed to solve a conflict or otherwise modify a <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> <b>route</b> and then merge the aircraft back to its nominal preferred trajectory using a single continuous trajectory clearance. A preliminary pilot-in-the-loop simulation evaluated two candidate procedures using a variety of horizontal and vertical trajectory clearances and found each to be feasible for basic datalink trajectory exchange.

The enhancement is being added to an automation concept {{referred to as the}} Advanced Airspace Concept (AAC) that is being developed {{to meet the needs of}} the air transportation system beyond NextGen. A <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> <b>route</b> and assigned altitude conformance monitor is added to the AAC.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a conflict resolution algorithm {{that can provide}} automated separation assurance {{for the next generation}} air traffic control system. The algorithm generates resolution trajectories that can be sent to the aircraft from a ground-based system via data link. The algorithm can also be installed on board aircraft. It handles the complete spectrum of conflict types encountered in en route airspace, including ascents and descents to arrival fixes. The resolution trajectories consist of amendments and changes to <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> (<b>route</b> changes), altitude clearances, and descent speed profiles. The trajectories are similar to those that controllers customarily issue to pilots in resolving conflicts. The algorithm generates 4 D resolution trajectories by evaluating successive alternative trial resolution maneuvers. Each conflict type determines a set of acceptable trial resolution maneuvers and what the preferred aircraft is to perform the maneuver. A trajectory engine generates a 4 D trajectory for each trial maneuver, and an associated conflict detector checks it to ensure it is conflict free. If it is not, the algorithm selects an alternative maneuver. This iterative process continues until a successful resolution is found. The resolution algorithm has been implemented and evaluated in a non-real time simulation, and its performance in resolving conflicts for a range of traffic levels is presented in this paper. Results indicate that the algorithm has the potential to resolve conflicts efficiently at significantly higher than current traffic levels. ...|$|R

The software tool aims to provide airline dispatchers with a decision aid for selecting optimal routes that avoid weather and other hazards. This evaluation compares and contrasts route selection performance with the AWIN tool to that of subjects using a more traditional dispatcher environment. The evaluation assesses gains in safety, in fuel efficiency of planned routes, and in time efficiency in the pre-flight dispatch process through the use of the AWIN decision aid. In addition, we are interested in how this AWIN tool affects constructs that can be related to performance. The construct of Situation Awareness (SA), workload, trust in an information system, and operator acceptance are assessed using established scales, where these exist, as well as through the evaluation of questionnaire responses and subject comments. The intention of the experiment is to set up a simulated operations area for the dispatchers to work in. They will be given scenarios in which they are presented with stored company routes for a particular city-pair and aircraft type. A diverse set of external weather information sources is represented by a stand-alone display (MOCK), containing the actual historical weather data typically used by dispatchers.

Transpolar flights reduce travel times, fuel burns, and associated environmental emissions by flying direct paths between many North American and Asian cities. This study evaluates {{the potential benefits of}} flying wind-optimal polar routes and assessed their potential impact on climate change. An optimization algorithm is developed for transpolar flights to generate wind-optimal trajectories that minimize climate impact of aircraft, in terms of global warming potentials (relative to warming by one kg of CO 2) of several types of emissions, while avoiding regions of airspace that facilitate persistent contrail formation. Estimations of global warming potential are incorporated into the objective function of the optimization algorithm to assess the climate impact of aircraft emissions discharged at a given location and altitude. The regions of airspace with very low ambient temperature and areas favorable to persistent contrail formation are modeled as undesirable regions that aircraft should avoid and are formulated as soft state constraints. The fuel burn and climate impact of cross-polar air traffic flying various types of trajectory including <b>flight</b> <b>plan,</b> great circle, wind-optimal, and contrail-avoidance are computed for 15 origin-destination pairs between major international airports in the U. S. and Asia. Wind-optimal routes reduce average fuel burn of <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> <b>routes</b> by 4. 4 % on December 4, 2010 and 8. 0 % on August 7, 2010, respectively. The tradeoff between persistent contrail formation and additional global warming potential of aircraft emissions is investigated with and without altitude optimization. Without altitude optimization, the reduction in contrail travel times is gradual with increase in total fuel consumption. When altitude is optimized, a one percent increase in additional global warming potential, a climate impact equivalent to that of 4070 kg and 4220 kg CO 2 emission, reduces 135 and 105 minutes persistent contrail formation per flight during a day with medium and high contrail formation, respectively...|$|R
40|$|FACET (Future ATM Concepts Evaluation Tool) is an Air Traffic Management {{research}} tool {{being developed}} at the NASA Ames Research Center. This paper describes the design, architecture and functionalities of FACET. The purpose of FACET is to provide E simulation environment for exploration, development and evaluation of advanced ATM concepts. Examples of these concepts include new ATM paradigms such as Distributed Air-Ground Traffic Management, airspace redesign and new Decision Support Tools (DSTs) for controllers working within the operational procedures of the existing air traffic control system. FACET is currently capable of modeling system-wide en route airspace operations over the contiguous United States. Airspace models (e. g., Center/sector boundaries, airways, locations of navigation aids and airports) are available from databases. A core capability of FACET is the modeling of aircraft trajectories. Using round-earth kinematic equations, aircraft can be flown along <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> <b>routes</b> or great circle routes as they climb, cruise and descend according to their individual aircraft-type performance models. Performance parameters (e. g., climb/descent rates and speeds, cruise speeds) are obtained from data table lookups. Heading, airspeed and altitude-rate dynamics are also modeled. Additional functionalities will be added as necessary for specific applications. FACET software is written in Java and C programming languages. It is platform-independent, and can be run {{on a variety of}} computers. FACET has been designed with a modular software architecture to enable rapid integration of research prototype implementations of new ATM concepts.

40|$|The Dynamic Weather Routes (DWR) tool is a {{ground-based}} trajectory automation system that continuously and automatically analyzes active in-flight aircraft in en route airspace to find simple modifications to <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> <b>routes</b> {{that can save}} significant flying time, while avoiding weather and considering traffic conflicts, airspace sector congestion, special use airspace, and FAA routing restrictions. Trials of the DWR system have shown that significant delay savings are possible. However, some DWR advised routes are also rejected by dispatchers or modified before being accepted. Similarly, of those sent by dispatchers to flight crews as proposed route change requests, many are not accepted by air traffic control, or are modified before implementation as Center route amendments. Such actions suggest that the operational acceptability of DWR advised route corrections could be improved, which may reduce workload and increase delay savings. This paper analyzes the historical usage of different flight routings, varying from simple waypoint pairs to lengthy strings of waypoints incorporating jet routes, {{in order to improve}} DWR route acceptability. An approach is developed that can be incorporated into DWR, advising routings with high historical usage and savings potential {{similar to that of the}} nominal DWR advisory. It is hypothesized that modifying a nominal DWR routing to one that is commonly used, and nearby, will result in more actual savings since common routings are generally familiar and operationally acceptable to air traffic control. The approach allows routing segments with high historical usage to be concatenated to form routes that meet all DWR constraints. The relevance of a route's historical usage to its acceptance by dispatchers and air traffic control is quantified by analyzing historical DWR data. Results indicate that while historical usage may be less of a concern to flight dispatchers accepting or rejecting DWR advised route corrections, it may be important to air traffic control acceptance of DWR routes...|$|R

The Dynamic Weather Routes automation has been continuously running with live air traffic data for a field evaluation at the American Airlines Integrated Operations Center in Fort Worth, TX since July 31, 2012, where flights within the Fort Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center are evaluated for time savings. This paper extends the methodology to all Centers in United States and presents benefits analysis of Dynamic Weather Routes automation, if it was implemented in multiple airspace Centers individually and concurrently.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringDale E. SchinstockThe {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop methods and tools for generating <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A method of generating <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> is needed to describe data collection missions, such as taking aerial photographs. The <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> are two-dimensional and exist in a plane a fixed distance above the Earth. Since the flight areas are typically small, the Earth's curvature is not accounted for in <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> generation. Designed to completely cover a specified field area, the plans consist of a series of line and arc segments and are described in a format that is recognized by the Piccolo autopilot used by the Kansas State University Autonomous Vehicle Systems (AVS) Lab. Grids are designed to cover the field area, and turn maneuvers are designed to ensure efficient <b>flight</b> <b>plans.</b> The <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> generation process is broken into several parts. Once a field area is defined, path lines covering this area are calculated. Optimal turn maneuvers are calculated to smoothly connect the path lines in a continuous <b>flight</b> <b>plan.</b> Two methods of determining path line order are discussed.
