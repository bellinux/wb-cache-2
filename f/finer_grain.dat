40|$|It {{is known}} that <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steel {{possesses}} high strength according to Hall-Petch relation and therefor many researchers are examining to use the <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steel on civil engineering and architecture fields as next generation's high strength material. Then the evaluation of corrosion resistance property to <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steel is very important. In this study, Stress Corrosion Cracking test was done on specimens of the <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steel and conventional steel.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the effect of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> on creep property of lamellar orientation controlled Ti- 43 mol% Al alloy, compressive creep tests were performed. Uniaxial compression process at αSingle-phase region and related compression process at (α＋γ) two-phase region made the lamellar interface almost parallel to the compression process plane. <b>Fine</b> <b>grains</b> were observed around the orientation controlled lamellar colonies after the process at (α＋γ) two-phase region. Volume fraction of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> increased with the decrease in true strain rate during the process. Further, in the same true strain rate, volume fraction of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> increased with the increase in true strain. These characteristics were almost the same in the case of dynamic recrystallization at the single-phase alloy. Thus, the formation of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> at (α＋γ) two phase region may indicate the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization. Minimum creep rate of the processed material increased with the increase in volume fraction of <b>fine</b> <b>grains.</b> The increase of creep rate of the entire material {{may be due to the}} preferential creep deformation of formed <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> by a diffusional creep mechanism...|$|R

500|$|A {{number of}} {{directors}} were {{considered for the}} episode, with Jonathan West being given the job. West had previously been the cinematographer on staff for both Deep Space Nine and The Next Generation, as well as directing several episodes of the franchise. He had nine days of preparation time before shooting began. He sought to match the same production values as The Original Series but found that lighting style and color saturation to film had changed in the intervening years. [...] Visual effects supervisor Dan Curry directed some of the second-unit sequences, and together with West and cinematographer Kris Krossgrove worked to rectify these issues. This was achieved by switching to a <b>finer</b> <b>grain</b> of film, by utilizing different lenses {{as well as by}} shooting from specific angles. With Gerrold on set as an extra, West used him as an unofficial advisor on matching the scenes from [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles".|$|E
2500|$|The three color {{records are}} stacked as shown at right, with a UV filter on top {{to keep the}} {{non-visible}} ultraviolet radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light. [...] Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the latent image. [...] When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its complementary color. [...] This forms a dye [...] "cloud" [...] (like {{a drop of water}} on a paper towel) and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the processed image by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or complementary color to blue). [...] There are two layers to each color; a [...] "fast" [...] and a [...] "slow." [...] The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has <b>finer</b> <b>grain</b> and is less sensitive to light. [...] Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are {{on the top of the}} film and they are followed immediately by a yellow filter, which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure. [...] Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed. [...] Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the film base is an anti-halation layer that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is [...] "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.|$|E

6000|$|My {{conditions}} (of situation etc.) here meanwhile (this winter)--I mean these admirable and ample {{two rooms}} southward over the River, so still {{and yet so}} animated--are ideal for work. Some other time I will explain it to you--so far as you won't have noted it for yourself--how and {{why it is that}} I come to be so little beforehand financially. My fatally interrupted production of fiction began it, six years or more ago--and that began, so utterly against my preconception of such an effect, when I addressed myself to the so much longer and more arduous and more fatal-to-everything-else preparation of my [...] "edition" [...] than had been measurable in advance. That long period cut dreadfully into current gains--through complete arrest of other current labour; and when it was at last ended I had only time to do two small books (The <b>Finer</b> <b>Grain</b> and The Outcry) before the disaster of my long illness of Jan. 1910 descended upon me and laid a paralysis on everything. This hideous Herpetic episode and its developments have been of the absolute continuity of that, as they now make it (I hope), dire but departing Climax; and they have represented an interminable arrest of literary income (to speak of.) Now that I can look to apparently again getting back to decent continuity of work it becomes vital for me to aim at returning to the production of the Novel, my departure from which, with its heart-breaking loss of time, was a catastrophe, a perversity and fatality, so little dreamed of by me or intended. I yearn for it intellectually, and with all the force of my [...] "genius" [...] and imagination--artistically in short--and only when this relation is renewed shall I be again on a normal basis. Only how I want to complete [...] "Notes of a Son and Brother" [...] with the last perfection first! Which is what I shall, I trust, during the next three or four months do, with far greater rapidity than I have done the first Book--for all last winter and spring my forenoon, my working hours, were my worst, and for long times so bad, and my later ones the better, whereas it is now the other way round.|$|E
6000|$|I reflected, as we {{went into}} the house, where we found Ambient {{unfolding}} the Observer at the breakfast-table, that none of them were probably quite so queer as his sister. Mrs. Ambient did not appear at breakfast, being rather tired with her ministrations, during the night, to Dolcino. Her husband mentioned, however, that she was hoping to go to church. I afterwards learned that she did go, but I may as well announce without delay that he and I did not accompany her. It was while the church-bell was murmuring in the distance that the author of Beltraffio led me forth for the ramble he had spoken of in his note. I will not attempt to say where we went, or to describe what we saw. We kept to the fields and copses and commons, and breathed the same sweet air as the nibbling donkeys and the browsing sheep, whose woolliness seemed to me, in those early days of my acquaintance with English objects, but a part of the general texture of the small, dense landscape, which looked as if the harvest were gathered by the shears. Everything was full of expression for Mark Ambient's visitor,--from the big, bandy-legged geese, whose whiteness was a [...] "note," [...] amid all the tones of green, as they wandered beside a neat little oval pool, the foreground of a thatched and whitewashed inn, with a grassy approach and a pictorial sign,--from these humble wayside animals to the crests of high woods which let a gable or a pinnacle peep here and there, and looked, even at a distance, like trees of good company, conscious of an individual profile. I admired the hedgerows, I plucked the faint-hued heather, and I was forever stopping to say how charming I thought the thread-like footpaths across the fields, which wandered, in a diagonal of <b>finer</b> <b>grain,</b> from one smooth stile to another. Mark Ambient was abundantly good-natured, and was as much entertained with my observations as I was with the literary allusions of the landscape. We sat and smoked upon stiles, broaching paradoxes in the decent English air; we took short cuts across a park or two, where the bracken was deep and my companion nodded to the old woman at the gate; we skirted rank covers, which rustled here and there as wo passed, and we stretched ourselves at last on a heathery hillside, where, if the sun was not too hot, neither was the earth too cold, and where the country lay beneath us in a rich blue mist. Of course I had already told Ambient what I thought of his new novel, having the previous night read every word of the opening chapters before I went to bed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{the study}} of <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steels aimed at {{achieving}} into high strength has become active. Welding {{is one of the}} most effective methods for connecting the structural components.

However, the influence of the Shot-Peening process on <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steels after welding has only been briefly reported up to now. In this study, <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steels were used, and specimens were obtained after heat treatment.
