Short-term lending rates have responded to this monetary relaxation and fell from 3.7% to 1.3% between 1993 and 2008.

500|$|The {{fantasy of}} She {{received}} particular acclaim from Victorian readers and critics. The review appearing in The Academy on 15 January {{was impressed by}} the [...] "grown-up" [...] vision of the novel, declaring [...] "the more impossible it gets the better Mr. Haggard does it... his astonishing imagination, and a certain vraisemblance [...] makes the most impossible adventures appear true". This sentiment was echoed in The Queen: The Lady's Newspaper, with the reviewer pronouncing that [...] "this is a tale {{in the hands of a}} writer not so able as Mr. Haggard might easily have become absurd; but he has treated it with so much vividness and picturesque power as to <b>invest</b> <b>it</b> with unflagging interest, and given to the mystery a port of philosophic possibility that makes us quite willing to submit to the illusion.|$|E

[...] Giving the film a B+ rating, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "Inside Man is a hybrid of studio action pic and Spike Lee joint.

500|$|Sulpicius Galba, now consul, {{convinced}} Rome {{to declare}} war on Philip and asked Attalus {{to meet up with}} the Roman fleet and again conduct a naval campaign, harassing Macedonian possessions in the Aegean. In the spring of 199BC, the combined Pergamon and Roman fleets took Andros in the Cyclades, the spoils going to the Romans and the island to Attalus. [...] From Andros they sailed south, made a fruitless attack on another Cycladic island, Kithnos, turned back north, scavenged the fields of Skiathos off the coast of Magnesia, for food, and continued north to Mende, where the fleets were wracked by storm. On land they were repulsed at Cassandrea, suffering heavy loss. They continued northeast along the Macedonian coast to Acanthus, which they sacked, after which they returned to Euboea, their vessels laden with spoils. On their return, the two leaders went to Heraclea to meet with the Aetolians, who under the terms of their treaty, had asked Attalus for a thousand soldiers. He refused, citing the Aetolians' own refusal to honor Attalus' request to attack Macedonia during Philip's attack on Pergamon two years earlier. Resuming operations, Attalus and the Romans attacked but failed to take Oreus and, deciding to leave a small force to <b>invest</b> <b>it,</b> attacked across the strait in Thessaly. When they returned to Oreus, they again attacked, this time successfully, the Romans taking the captives, Attalus the city.
