5|$|Wolves carry ectoparasites and endoparasites, with {{wolves in}} the former Soviet Union having been {{recorded}} to carry at least 50 species. Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious <b>in</b> <b>sick</b> or malnourished specimens. Parasitic infection in wolves is of particular concern to people, as wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.|$|E

25|$|On December 31, 2012, an {{apparent}} sick-out occurred. In early December 2012, Mayor Gray announced bonuses for all city workers except police and firefighters. On New Year's Eve, more than 100 firefighters, paramedics, and EMTs unexpectedly called <b>in</b> <b>sick.</b> Usually, about 20 of the 440 firefighters on duty call <b>in</b> <b>sick</b> each day. DCFEMS confirmed that some firetrucks sat idle due to low staffing. The city accused the firefighters' and paramedics' unions of organizing an illegal wildcat strike, while both unions denied it. The incident {{led to a}} number of off-duty staff being called in, significant overtime, and delayed care.|$|E

The dispute was resolved with a new agreement with ALPA in August 2007 in which pilots would be compensated for overtime. Northwest also began hiring new pilots to alleviate the pilot shortages they faced throughout {{the summer of}} 2007.|$|E
25|$|Homeopathy is {{a system}} of {{alternative}} medicine created in 1796 by Samuel Hahnemann, based on his doctrine of like cures like (similia similibus curentur), a claim that a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people would cure similar symptoms <b>in</b> <b>sick</b> people. Homeopathy is a pseudoscience – a belief that is incorrectly presented as scientific. Homeopathic preparations are not effective for treating any condition; large-scale studies have found homeopathy {{to be no more}} effective than a placebo, indicating that any positive effects that follow treatment are only due to the placebo effect, normal recovery from illness, or regression toward the mean.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the 16th century, a doctor from Verona named Girolamo Fracastoro was the first to propose a theory that these very small, unseeable, {{particles}} that cause disease were alive. They were considered to be able to spread by air, multiply by themselves and to be destroyable by fire. In this way he refuted Galen's miasma theory (poison gas <b>in</b> <b>sick</b> people). In 1543 he wrote a book De contagione et contagiosis morbis, in which {{he was the first to}} promote personal and environmental hygiene to prevent disease. The development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a germ theory of disease.|$|E

Gimblett missed the bus from Taunton, and hitched a lift in a lorry. Somerset won the toss and chose to bat: three batsmen were out for 35, and at lunch the score was 105 for five. Soon after lunch, Dickie Burrough was out and Gimblett came to the wicket with Somerset six wickets down for 107 runs, joining Arthur Wellard.|$|E
25|$|Candidates {{applying}} {{for the fourth}} series were invited to do so through the programme's official website, leading to 20,000 applications being submitted for the series, and 16 of them making it through {{to take part in}} the show. Its first episode aired on 26 March 2008, with its debut attracting 6.4 million viewers. This climbed to around 8.9 million viewers for the final episode, with an additional 800,000 viewers tuning in for the episode's final 15 minutes, to catch Lee McQueen winning the series. Lee went on to initially work for Sugar's company AMSHOLD, where he phoned <b>in</b> <b>sick</b> on his first day, and then went on to work for AMSCREEN as development director, reporting to Sugar's son, Simon Sugar, before leaving his employment in 2010.|$|E
25|$|A {{firefighter}} sick-out {{appeared to}} occur {{the week of}} August 18, 2013. Usually, 20 to 30 firefighters call <b>in</b> <b>sick</b> in an average week. But beginning on August 18, 83 firefighters did so. The absences caused the department to require mandatory overtime of 67 firefighters, forcing them to work for 36 straight hours. DCFEMS officials called the illnesses suspicious, while the union said the illnesses showed the department had too few firefighters to cover the schedule. At a press conference on August 26, Ellerbe asserted that the firefighter shortage would be ending soon. He said 60 firefighters would {{be added to the}} force {{by the end of the}} year. He credited new hires, as well as graduates of the fire training academy, for adding to the force.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{search for}} elixir of {{immortality}} has yielded mixed results. While {{some of the}} interventions like percutaneous coronary interventions and coronary artery bypass grafting have been a huge disappointment {{at least as far}} as prolongation of life is concerned, their absolute benefit is meager and that too <b>in</b> very <b>sick</b> patients. Cardiac specific drugs like statins and aspirin have fared slightly better, being useful in patients with manifest coronary artery disease, particularly <b>in</b> <b>sicker</b> populations although even their usefulness in primary prevention is rather low. The only strategies of proven benefit in primary/primordial prevention are pursuing a healthy life-style and its modification when appropriate, like cessation of smoking, weight reduction, increasing physical activity, eating a healthy diet and bringing blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and blood glucose under control...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between health behavior and general health status. MethodsWe used data from the 2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Mental health was measured by stress recognition and depression. Dietary habit was measured by mixed grain diet. Life pattern was measured by sleeping time and working pattern. Physical activity was measured by walking and exercise. We defined general health status as Euro Quality of Life- 5 Dimension (EQ- 5 Dindex), Euro Quality of Life Visual Analogue Scale (EQ- 5 Dvas), number of people experienced lying <b>in</b> a <b>sickbed</b> for the last one month, number of days lying <b>in</b> a <b>sickbed</b> for the last one month, and activity limitations. ResultsMental health, dietary habit, life pattern, and physical activity have seven factors. Most of the factors have a significant correlation with EQ- 5 Dindex, EQ- 5 Dvas, number of people experienced lying <b>in</b> a <b>sickbed</b> for the last one month, number of days lying <b>in</b> a <b>sickbed</b> for the last one month, and activity limitations. ConclusionHealth behavior and general health status have a positive correlation...|$|R

[...] Several elements, {{such as the use}} of the song [...] "Oh Yeah", and a valet monotonously calling for [...] "Broderick... Broderick...", appear in the ad. A teaser for the ad had appeared two weeks prior to the Super Bowl, which had created rumors of a possible film sequel. It was produced by Santa Monica-based RPA and directed by Todd Phillips. AdWeek's Tim Nudd called the ad [...] "a great homage to the original 1986 film, with Broderick this time calling <b>in</b> <b>sick</b> to a film shoot and enjoying another day of slacking." [...] On the other hand, Jalopniks Matt Hardigree called the spot [...] "sacrilegious".|$|E
500|$|As they journey {{towards the}} Klingon neutral zone, Scotty tinkers with the transporter. He {{develops}} {{a method to}} make a temporary tachyon copy of a crewman that could be transported a much greater distance than the standard range of a transporter beam, enabling the Enterprise to place an agent on Organia long before the ship could reach the planet. Spock is chosen, but a permanent duplicate is created unexpectedly upon transportation—something at Organia has functioned as a perfect, impenetrable mirror for the tachyons. When the duplicate returns, the crew is confused by the two Spocks. The two Spocks are psychically linked, and the original determines that the copy is acting as an agent for the Klingons. [...] After faking a mental breakdown and barricading himself <b>in</b> <b>sick</b> bay, the copy escapes on a shuttlecraft.
