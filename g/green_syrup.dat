60|$|The <b>green</b> <b>syrup</b> coursed along vein and artery like molten lead. A horrifying {{transparency}} {{began to}} spread over my mind. It seemed it had become in that instant empty and radiant as a dome of glass. All sounds hushed away. Things near faded into an infinite distance. Every face, glossed with light as if varnished, became lifeless, brutal, and inhuman, the grotesque caricature of a shadowy countenance that hung somewhere remote in memory, yet was invisible and irrevocable. In this dead moment--the whole blazing scene like a nowhere of the imagination--my wandering eyes met Fanny's. She was softly languishing up at Captain Valentine, her fingers toying with a rose. And {{it seemed as though}} her once loved spirit cried homelessly out at me from space, as if for refuge and recognition; and a long-hidden flood broke bounds in my heart. All else forgotten, and obeying mechanically the force of long habit, I stepped up from my chair on to the table, and staggered towards her, upsetting, as I went, a shallow glass of bubbling wine. It reeked up in the air around me.|$|E
5000|$|The high <b>green</b> <b>syrup</b> {{is fed to a}} {{raw sugar}} vacuum pan {{from which a}} second batch of sugar is produced. This sugar ("raw") is of lower quality with more colour and impurities, and is the main source of the sugar {{dissolved}} again into the mother liquor. The syrup from the raw (Low <b>green</b> <b>syrup)</b> is boiled {{for a long time in}} AP Pans and sent to slowly flow around a series of about eight crystallisers. From this, a very low-quality sugar crystal is produced (known in some systems as [...] "AP sugar") that is also redissolved. The syrup separated is molasses, which still contains sugar, but contains too much impurity to undergo further processing economically. The molasses is stored on site and is added to dried beet pulp to make animal feed. Some is also sold in bulk tankers.|$|E
5000|$|Thick {{juice is}} fed to the crystallizers. Recycled sugar is {{dissolved}} into it, {{and the resulting}} syrup is called mother liquor. The liquor is concentrated further by boiling under a vacuum in large vessels (the so-called vacuum pans) and seeded with fine sugar crystals. These crystals grow as sugar from the mother liquor forms around them. The resulting sugar crystal and syrup mix is called a massecuite, from [...] "cooked mass" [...] in French. The massecuite is passed to a centrifuge, where the High <b>Green</b> <b>syrup</b> {{is removed from the}} massecuite by centrifugal force. After a predeterminedtime, water is then sprayed into the centrifuge via a spray bar to wash the sugar crystals which produces Low <b>Green</b> <b>syrup.</b> The centrifuge then spins at very high speed to partially dry the crystals the machine then slows down and a plough shaped arm is deployed which ploughs out the sugar from the sides of the centrifuge from the top to the bottom onto conveying plant underneath where it is transported into a rotating granulator where it is dried using warm air.|$|E

5000|$|Refiners' syrup {{begins as}} a high brix, pale sucrose syrup made from white sugar and water {{designed}} to loosen the dried molasses found on raw sugar crystals. The sucrose saturated content of the initial [...] "green" [...] syrup impedes sugar crystals from dissolving {{during the process of}} washing. The purpose is to mix the <b>green</b> <b>syrup</b> with raw sugar crystals to form a [...] "magma" [...] of 8-10% moisture content at around 60-65 degrees C that is then washed with water in a centrifuge. After the first washing (often termed affination) the [...] "washed off" [...] molasses combines with the sucrose syrup to generate refiners' return syrup, which is generally re-used several times until deemed spent. The spent refiners' return syrup is sold off to manufacturers for golden syrup production or is sent to a recovery section of the refinery often called the remelt house or boil-out section. Here it is reheated to crystallize and recover the sucrose it contains and that is returned to the affination stage. The final spent syrup left after the recovery process is sold as treacle (often called refiners' molasses in older texts).|$|E
40|$|To remain competitive, {{centrifugal}} manufacturers need to continuously {{review their}} designs. This results in ongoing incremental improvements. Occasionally, {{a more radical}} set of several improvements are simultaneously introduced to produce a significantly new machine. The existing BMA G-series centrifugals were recently subjected to re-engineering to produce a new B-series. Aspects of the successfUl redesign are described. Novel features of the re-engineered centrifugals are: a new plough of the same length as the full height of the basket, resulting in:- shorter discharging time- less residual sugar in the basket. 0 a new syrup separator resulting in:- optimal separation of wash and <b>green</b> <b>syrup</b> due to the built-in separator- considerably improved sugar house work. all product-contacted components in stainless steel as standard an improved centering device for spindle during sugar discharge drive head bearing system with two bearings only new dampening device adjustable fiom outside the centrifugal an easily removable basket {{without the need for}} a split spindle a working screen without a lock-lap joint. high performance low maintenance cost pricelperformance ratio. To remain successful, manufacturers and suppliers of centrifugal machines need to subject their designs to continuous improvement and development, always putting safety as the top priority. Design details Centi. ijiugal basket In the recent past, centrifugal basket volumes have been continuously increasing due to market requirements, resulting in volumes of 2, 200 kg per charge and even more. In general {{it can be said that}} in the purging of even sized crystals for both white and raw sugar a gravity factor of approximately l 000 to 1 - l 00 is sufficient. The layer thickness in the basket should not exceed 230 mm, especially for fine sugar having a crystal size of approximately 0, 4 mm, since the smaller gaps between such crystals provide more resistance to molasses drainage. The baskets described here are exclusively in stainless steel. A higher charge volume of the centrifugal basket (Figure 1) can be achieved by increasing: the height H of the basket andor the diameter D of the basket andlor the thickness of the crystal layer HK...|$|E
