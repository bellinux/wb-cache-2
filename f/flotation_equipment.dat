40|$|No-tillage corn {{production}} has been practiced in Virginia {{for more than}} 35 years (Jones et al. 1968), yet many producers have not used no-tillage to its maximum advantage. This publication addresses where no-tillage corn {{can and should be}} adopted, and where no-tillage production needs to be modified to reduce production problems associated with continuous use. Advantages of No-Tillage No-tillage corn production conserves soil and water and reduces capital investment in machinery, but most important to many producers, no-tillage can improve corn yields. For example, in a 15 -year study at Virginia Tech, no-tillage corn planted into a rye cover crop out-yielded conventional tillage corn by 16 percent (Moschler et al. 1972). In a three-year University of Maryland study, no-tillage corn in a small-grain/ double-crop soybean stubble out-yielded conventional tillage corn by 28 bushels per acre. By reducing water runoff and soil erosion, no-tillage reduces soil loss and improves stream water quality. Adding organic matter through residue can improve soil structure and fertility. The residue cover also provides for better <b>flotation</b> of <b>equipment</b> over the field surface, allowing planting and harvesting to occur under wetter soil conditions. However, {{it must be noted that}} planting or harvesting when the soil is too wet may contribute to soil compaction. Obtaining significant yield increases from no-tillage requires sound management decisions and attention to some unique problems. Liming A soil pH of 6. 0 to 6. 5 is needed for best results from no-tillage, because triazine herbicides require a pH in this range for best performance. This pH range is also recommended for maximizing nutrient availability to the corn crop.

40|$|O reator de FAD deve propiciar condições adequadas para contato entre as micro-bolhas e os flocos formados no pré-tratamento e também condições para que o conjunto floco/bolha possa ser direcionado ao topo do reator, e assim ser removido. O projeto de pesquisa visou estudar condições hidrodinâmicas proporcionadas pela variação da Velocidade Cross-Flow (VCF) e assim verificar a influência na eficiência de uma estação piloto de flotação por ar dissolvido. A VCF é importante parâmetro para concepção de unidades de FAD e é função da vazão de entrada no tanque de flotação e da área entre o nível dá́gua no tanque de flotação e o anteparo que separa a zona de contato da zona de separação. A velocidade {{cross-flow}} constitui um parâmetro de grande importância para projetos de unidades de flotação. Nesta região de transição entre a zona de contato e a zona de separação, ocorre a passagem do conjunto floco/bolha, e turbulência excessiva pode causar o rompimento do conjunto e assim comprometer a eficiência da flotação. Além disso, o padrão de escoamento observado na zona de separação dos flotadores, onde ocorre a separação dos aglomerados f̈locos + bolhas,̈ depende fortemente do valor médio da velocidade cross-flow, conforme comentado por Lundh et al. (2000 e 2002) e por Reali e Patrizzi (2007). Daí a necessidade de se investigar mais profundamente a influência da VCF na eficiência da clarificação por flotação. O projeto de pesquisa foi dividido em duas etapas. Para realização das etapas foi estudado um tipo de água preparada em laboratório, através da adição de substância húmica e caulinita, para obtenção de cor aparente e turbidez, respectivamente. A água estudada possui cor aparente e turbidez moderada (1 mg/L de substância húmica e 8, 5 mg/L de caulinita) resultando em valores de turbidez por volta de 7 NTU e cor aparente por volta de 40 UH. A etapa 1 consistiu na determinação do par, pH de coagulação e dosagem de coagulante (sulfato de alumínio), gradiente médio de floculação e tempo médio de floculação adequado para a água de estudo. Para realização da etapa 1 foi utilizado equipamento de flotação de bancada de regime de batelada (Flotateste), que se encontra nas dependências do Laboratório de Tratamento Avançado e Reuso de Águas - LATAR/SHS/EESC/USP. Foram mantidos fixos os seguintes parâmetros: T́ IND. MR,́Ǵ IND. MR,́T́ IND. F,́Ǵ IND. F,́Ṕ IND. SAT,́T́ IND. REC,́V́ IND.

Após determinado o melhor par pH e dosagem de coagulante foram realizados ensaios visando determinar o melhor Ǵ IND. FéT́ IND. Fṕara a água em estudo. Para a água de estudo foram escolhidas duas condições de potencial Zeta, determinados na etapa 1 do projeto de pesquisa. A primeira condição o potencial Zeta permaneceria com valor próximo de 0 mV e na segunda condição o potencial Zeta seria positivo, por volta de + 12 mV. A etapa 2 consistiu em variar a velocidade cross-flow, através da variação da altura do vertedor de saída da água flotada de uma unidade piloto de flotação, de forma a se obter diferentes valores de VCF (mantendo-se constantes os valores de tempo de contato e taxa de aplicação superficial na zona de contato), para dois valores de Taxas de Aplicação Superficial (TAS) (7, 67 m/h e 15 m/h) na zona de separação e os dois valores de potencial Zeta (PZ), e com isto avaliar a sua influencia na eficiência de remoção de sólidos suspensos totais, cor e turbidez da instalação piloto retangular de FAD. The reactor DAF {{should provide}} adequate conditions for {{contact between the}} micro-bubbles and the flakes formed in the pretreatment conditions and also for the aggregate flocs/bubble can be directed {{to the top of}} the reactor, and thus be removed. The research project aimed at studying hydrodynamic conditions provided by the variation of Cross-Flow Velocity (VCF) and thus checks the influence on the efficiency of a pilot plant of dissolved air flotation. The VCF is an important parameter to design units of DAF and is a function of input flow in the flotation tank and the area between the water level in the flotation tank and the bulkhead that separates the contact zone of the zone of separation. The cross-flow velocity is a parameter of great importance to projects of flotation units. In this region of the transition zone between the contact zone and the separation zone, occurs the passage of the aggregate flocs/bubble, and excessive turbulence can cause disruption of the aggregate and thereby harm the flotation efficiency. Moreover, the pattern of flow observed in the flotation separation zone, which occurs the separation of aggregates f̈lakes + bubbles,̈ depends strongly on the average value of cross-flow velocity as described by Lundh et al. (2000 and 2002) and Reali and Patrizzi (2007). Hence the needs to investigate further the influence of VCF on the clarification efficiency by flotation. The research project was divided into two steps. To perform the steps has been studied a type of water prepared in the laboratory, through the addition of humic substances and kaolin, to obtain apparent color and turbidity, respectively. The study water has moderate turbidity and apparent color (1 mg/L of humic substance and 8. 5 mg/L of kaolin) resulting in turbidity values around 7 NTU and color apparent by 40 HU. Step 1 consisted in the determination of the pair, coagulation pH and coagulant dosage (aluminum sulfate), flocculation gradient and time flocculation suitable for the study water. For the implementation of step 1 was used bench batch <b>flotation</b> system <b>equipment</b> (Flotatest), located on the Laboratory for Advanced Treatment and Reuse Water - LATAR / SHS / EESC / USP. Were kept fixed the following parameters: T́ IND. MR,́Ǵ IND. MR,́T́ IND. F,́Ǵ IND. F,́Ṕ IND. SAT,́T́ IND. REC,́V́ IND. FLOT. ́ As predicted by Reali et al (2007), was varied the dosage of coagulant. After determined the best pair of coagulant dosage and pH coagulation the tests were performed to determine the best Ǵ IND. Fánd T́ IND. Ff́or the study water. For the study water were chosen two conditions of Zeta potential values, determined in the step 1 of the research project, where the first condition the Zeta potential value kept near 0 mV and the second condition kept a positive value of Zeta potential, around + 12 mV. The step 2 consisted of varying the cross-flow velocity, by varying the height of the outlet weir of the clarified water of the flotation pilot plant to obtain different values of VCF (keeping constant the values of time contact and application rate on the contact zone) for two values of superficial application rates (7. 67 m/h and 15 m/h) in the zone of separation and the two values of Zeta potential (PZ) and then was availed the influence on removal efficiency of total suspended solids, colour and turbidity of the rectangular pilot plant of DAF...|$|R

50|$|The hydroflight {{industry}} {{is full of}} hazards and potential for things to go wrong. Here {{is a list of}} things that pilots must keep their eyes peeled for whilst operating a device.• Rocks and other submerged objects can be a very dangerous hazard for all hydroflight participants. Before diving under the water it is best to have a good understanding of what lies beneath the surface and the depth of the water. • Water depth is another critical element to the sport of hydroflight. If the pilot is operating only 1-3 meters above the water, then they should have at least 2 meters of depth below them. If the pilot exceeds 3 meters, then the water depth must now be at a depth of 4 meters.• Objects above the water can be as equally as dangerous as any other submerged objects. Whilst flying in the air a pilot must keep on the lookout for any 3D objects such as bridges, buoys, boats, jetties, other hydroflight pilots and the hose and jet ski that they’re attached to.• Dolphin dives is a fantastic manoeuvre that is usually performed more on the jet-boards. Although it looks spectacular it holds a great danger because the pilot is diving head first into the water from any height between 1-15 meters. Whilst performing this manoeuvre it is essential to know how to execute it perfectly and also to have the knowledge of what lies beneath the surface and how much water depth you have to work with.• Knee knockouts are the most common of injuries when it comes to advanced manoeuvres. If the pilot bends his knees and goes into a squat position whilst the board is lifting them up with high power, {{there is a good chance}} the knee will make contact with the face.• Weather and tides can be hazardous to any pilot no matter their skill level. Tides and currents can play a big factor because if the tide goes out it may take away the valuable water depth that is needed to maintain your safety. If the current is creating rips on the beach, then the pilot can easily drift out of his designated zone or float out to sea if they’re not concentrating. If storms approach it is best to exit the water because there are many electricity conducting components in the jet skis and hydroflight devices that could end up giving you a nasty shock if lighting gets too close.• Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning can be hazardous to your health and even cause death. To ensure safety you must never get to close to the back of the jet ski where these fumes are released whilst the engine is turned on.• <b>Flotation</b> <b>equipment</b> is essential. Always ensure that your PFD has a rating of level 3 and that your chosen hydroflight devices floatation is still buoyant.• Not only should their always be someone observing your flight from the jet ski but for extra safety you should also have another on the beach. Always discuss and arrange your hand signals so that all participants are on the same page before starting.|$|E

40|$|Flotation is an {{important}} part of coal preparation, and the flotation column is widely applied as efficient <b>flotation</b> <b>equipment.</b> This process is complex and affected by many factors, with the froth depth and reagent dosage being two of the most important and frequently manipulated variables.

Second, a control model for optimizing the set point of the froth depth is constructed based on fuzzy control, and a control model is designed to optimize the reagent dosages based on expert system. Finally, the least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) is used to identify the operating conditions of the flotation process and to select one of the two models (froth depth or reagent dosage) for subsequent operation according to the condition parameters.

40|$|The up-scaling of <b>flotation</b> <b>equipment</b> {{has been}} {{investigated}} based on comparisons between laboratory, pilot and industrial scale flotation tests and a characterization study of large-scale industrial flotation cells in Boliden’s Aitik copper mine in Northern Sweden. The use of high volume flotation cells has nowadays {{become more and more}} common to deal with the production of high capacity, low-grade open pit mines, which are typically copper or gold mines. Implementation of large flotation cells in the mineral beneficiation process holds several financial benefits, but gives no guarantee of an equal or improved metallurgical performance. From a historical point of view, flotation plants have been designed {{based on the results of}} laboratory tests, multiplied with a time up-scaling factor at which recovery was expected to be above a certain value on the industrial scale. Due to the uniqueness of each ore, such an experience-based factor has often resulted into under- or overestimations of the total required cell volume. One of the main differences between lab and industrial flotation in this research is found the be the behaviour of fine particles (- 45 ?m), which are shown to have slower flotation kinetics and poor recovery on the industrial scale in comparison to the lab scale, but are also accompanied by a relatively high degree of gangue mineral entrainment in lab tests. A characterization of the industrial <b>flotation</b> <b>equipment</b> was done to acquire more information on the sub-processes that take place within the cells. Sampling on different depths in 160 m 3 rougher and scavenger cells revealed a well-mixed regime in the lower cell half, decreasing homogeneity above a depth of 2, 5 m under the froth, and an accumulation zone of fine-grained copper-rich minerals directly under the pulp-froth interface. The effectiveness of the low-turbulent zone in the top half of the industrial flotation cell is questioned, while the general trend in flotation cell design of increasing volume even shows an increasing height-to-diameter ratio, which could eventually lead to a larger fraction of the cell volume being low turbulent. To obtain more insight in the functioning of these flotation cell sub-zones, the use of a bubble load measurement is proposed to determine the recovery of both valuable and gangue minerals as a profile of cell height. Furthermore test work in a laboratory pilot scale cell with adjustable height is discussed, in which the volume fractions of the mixing zone, quiescent zone and froth zone can be varied. Combination of these two investigations is expected to allow better understanding of how an industrial flotation cell functions.

The {{beneficiation}} of {{ultrafine coal}} by froth flotation {{is a widely}} used process, and its importance {{for the treatment of}} - 0. 1 mm coal has been appreciated of late in South African coal washing plants. A number of problems adversely affect the efficiency of this process, such as poor liberation, poor floatability, gangue entraiment/entrapment, and high mass recovery which can lead to throughput limitations in coal <b>flotation</b> <b>equipment.</b> Reverse coal flotation is a novel process which has been proposed to address three problems occurring in the conventional, "forward flotation" of coal, namely: high mass recovery, gangue entrainment and the variability of floatability of South African coals. In this process, the entire gangue fraction in the coal would. be floated in a single step process, with the clean coal product reporting as the tailings. To the author's knowledge, no_ such process has been investigated previously for coal flotation. In this thesis, a reverse flotation process for ultrafine coal beneficiation was developed from first principles. In order to obtain a clear understanding and interpretation of experimental flotation results, artificial feed mixtures consisting of blends of "pure" gangue and "pure" coal were used for a large section of the experimental testwork. Having established the technical viability of the process on these artificial mixtures, the flotation work was extended to four South African run-of-mine coals. The study comprised the selection of suitable reagents for reverse flotation and the evaluation of these reagents experimentally. Experimental testwork comprised batch adsorption tests, and flotation tests in a conventional, sub-aeration laboratory batch cell and in a laboratory column flotation cell. The process was evaluated in terms of coal recovery into the product and gangue removal in the waste stream, and its metallurgical performance was compared to conventional flotation using both the artificial feeds and r. o. m. coals...|$|E

Design criteria are typically based on {{rule of thumb}} procedures that often prove to be highly ineffective. The development of appropriate models of the flotation process {{is a means of}} addressing these problems so that flotation plant simulations can be performed to identify the true potential of existing plants {{as well as in the}} design of new flotation plants. This thesis addresses the complex issue of developing a robust methodology for use in flotation circuit modelling and simulation, based on the operation of pilot-scale <b>flotation</b> <b>equipment.</b> The investigation is focussed on the processing of platinum bearing ores from the UG 2 reef in South Africa. The UG 2 reef is of considerable economic importance, containing a substantial proportion of the world wide reserves of platinum group metals. However, UG 2 ore has very complex mineralogy, and a high degree of association with chromite, which renders processing of this ore relatively difficult. Consequently, optimising the design of flotation circuits to treat this ore has proved challenging, and has been the focus of much attention by major platinum producers over the last 10 to 20 years. The primary aim of this thesis is to identify, evaluate and refine appropriate flotation models and modelling procedures reported in the literature, and use these models to develop a flotation circuit simulation procedure that can be used to provide a sound basis for the evaluation of current UG 2 circuit design trends, and as an optimisation tool for the design of UG 2 circuits in the future. The processing of UG 2 ore from three different locations is evaluated, using two continuous pilot plants of different size, each operated in a variety of different configurations. The investigation required extensive modification of the pilot plant facility that was used, to facilitate the acquisition of the data required by the selected models. The basis and implications of these modifications with respect to the design and operation of pilot plants as a tool for design and optimisation is extensively covered. The modelling approach adopted in this study is based on the separation of the factors affecting flotation into those arising from the characteristics of the ore (floatability) and those arising owing to the hydrodynamics in the equipment, in both the pulp and froth zones of the cell. It is proposed that the pulp zone performance can best be related to the bubble surface area flux based on the work of Gorain et al (1997), while ore floatability is modelled using a distributed floatability model, based on the approach developed by Runge et al (1997) and Harris (1997). The performance of the froth phase with respect to minerals recovered by true flotation is modelled based on the approach proposed by Harris (1997) and Gorain et al (1998), while entrainment in the froth is modelled using the approach proposed by Savassi et al (1998) ...|$|E

As minor species, they commonly contain reduced sulphur compounds (RSC) (sulfoxyanions with sulphur in the oxidation state below (VI) such as SO 32 -, S 2 O 32 -, S 2 O 52 -, and S 4 O 62 -), cations of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, frothing molecules, residual chemical reagents and products of their degradation. However, the key step towards developing scientific approaches of recycling the process water is elucidation of how, in what extent, and why the recycled water components (taken singly or jointly) influence flotation of sulphides. Therefore a research program was initiated to understand {{the influence of the}} major and minor process water species on flotation and how to flexibly control such effects if any. In this work, the influence of major components of calcium and sulphate ions in process water on flotation of chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite and pyrite minerals were investigated by Hallimond tube flotation. The surface chemistry and xanthate collector adsorption on the minerals under the influence of process water species were also studied by zeta-potential measurement, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with diffuse reflectance attachment and Xray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopy. The effects of the major components were also investigated on complex sulphide ores flotation using bench scale <b>flotation</b> <b>equipment.</b> The impact of the species in flotation was studied using deionised water, tap water, process water and simulated water containing equivalent amount of calcium and sulphate species in process water. Oxidation of sulphide minerals has been known to be a very critical issue during flotation of sulphide minerals while several authors had reported that pyrite, the most abundant metal sulphide and very common gangue mineral in sulphide ores can generate hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizing agent stronger than oxygen. It was revealed that ferric defects on ground pyrite surfaces can generate OH• radicals upon interaction with water and combination of two OH• radicals yields H 2 O 2. However, participation of these species in non-selective oxidation of the sulphide ore pulp components and hence in deteriorating the concentrate grade and recovery of metal-sulphides has not still been explored yet. In an attempt to fill the gap, a preliminary study was done to estimate the concentration of H 2 O 2 in a complex sulphide ore pulp liquid during different times of ore grinding and compare them to oxidation of pulp solid. Study of possible ways of flexibly controlling H 2 O 2 formation through known chemical means was also attempted. Hallimond tube flotation results showed marginally lower recoveries of chalcopyrite and galena in process water and in the presence of calcium and sulphate ions in both deionised and process waters using potassium amyl xanthate as collector. Whereas sphalerite and pyrite floatability were little increased in process water. There is no significant effect of calcium and sulphate ions on sphalerite in deionised water using isobutyl xanthate as collector. Zeta-potential shows the adsorption of calcium ions on the minerals whereby the potential are seen to increase, while sulphate ions have no significant effect. FTIR and XPS studies revealed the presence of surface oxidised sulfoxy species and surface calcium carbonates and/or calcium sulphate on chalcopyrite in the presence of process water and water containing calcium ions. Surface oxidised sulfoxy and carbonate species were seen on galena in the presence of deionised water, process water and water containing calcium and sulphate ions. The studies also showed hydrated surface oxidised species and surface iron and calcium carbonates on pyrite in the presence of process water and water containing calcium ions all at flotation pH 10. 5. These surface species influenced xanthate adsorption on chalcopyrite, galena and pyrite. The presence of surface oxidised sulfoxy and carbonate species at the sphalerite flotation pH 11. 5 were seen in the presence of deionised water, process water and water containing calcium and sulphate ions, but the surface species does not influence xanthate adsorption. Formation of hydrogen peroxide was revealed during grinding of a complex sulphide ore {{for the first time in}} mineral processing application and its formation was reduced by diethylenetriamine (DETA). FTIR spectroscopy of the pulp solid fraction shows varying degree of oxidised surface species which is related to concentration of H 2 O 2 analyzed in pulp liquid. Addition of DETA at low concentration during grinding of complex sulphide ore depresses iron and copper minerals flotation during copper-lead flotation stage, DETA also depresses iron minerals during zinc mineral flotation. Consequently copper minerals flotation to copper-lead products is reduced and they are reporting to zinc products. However zinc minerals flotation to zinc product is improved. Tests performed on two different complex sulphide ores using bench scale <b>flotation</b> <b>equipment</b> showed that chalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite minerals recoveries are better in process water than tap water. The results also showed general decrease of the minerals floatability at temperatures lower than 22 oC in either tap water or process water. An analysis of pulp liquid after flotation shows decreased calcium and increased sulphate ions. This indicates that there is adsorption of calcium ions on the minerals and dissolution and release of sulphate ions in solution. The studies showed that the process water can be recycled in flotation with no significant effect on grade and recovery of sulphide minerals.

40|$|MODELLING OF LARGE-SIZE INDUSTRIAL <b>FLOTATION</b> <b>EQUIPMENT</b> The main {{objective}} of this project was the hydrodynamic and metallurgical characterization of large-size flotation cells. As industrial equipment, the work was focused mainly on rougher flotation cells of 130 m 3 located at the concentrating plant of the El Teniente Division, Codelco-Chile. The liquid and solid DTR was measured in three types of sizes (- 45, + 45 + 150, - 150 microns) in self-priming flotation cells of 130 m 3. The mean residence times observed in each cell ranged from 4. 5 to 6 minutes for different tonnages for operation of the plant. The DTR measurements were conducted through the radioactive tracer technique and allowed confirming that the operation of these equipments is different to the perfect mixing condition. In this regard, DTR for each individual cell was appropriately characterized through a LSTS (large and small tank-in-series) model. Moreover, the individual hydrodynamic behavior of all the cells in the bank was compared, detecting a high consistence in the operation with exceptions where short-circuits were observed. Complementarily, the transient modeling of the mixing process in industrial flotation cells was developed. In this regard, it was detected that the mixing time in a cell of 130 m 3 is about 60 - 80 seconds, comparable {{to the time of}} a pulp circulation in the rotor. Also, it was determined that pulp circulates about 5 times in the rotor before it abandons the cell. A new experimental technique was developed to determine DTR and the mean residence time of the liquid and solid through the large cell foam by using radioactive tracer and processing data through discrete deconvolution of time signals. A new metallurgical model with analytical solution for the collection zone of flotation columns was developed. A rectangular distribution for the kinetic constant and a LSTS (large and small tank-in-series) -type mixing model are considered in this model. A new technique was developed that allows identifying the kinetic constant for modeling an industrial flotation bank from a reduced experimental design, which consists in the solution of only two mass balances (first cell and global bank). Moreover, a methodology was developed that enables separating the scaling factor of flotation equipments, considering the independent kinetic component of hydrodynamics. A new system was developed for determining bubble load, a key element for measuring foam recovery in industrial cells. In this regard, the bubble load was measured in industrial flotation cells of 130 m 3 through capturing bubbles in a new prototype developed in the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria. This measuring together with the direct measuring of gas flow and mass balance allowed directly evaluating foam recovery in large industrial cells. A phenomenological model was developed to describe foam, of the CFD-type, which enabled describing the trajectory of liquid, air and solid flows, and also the composition spatial profiles (in two dimensions). The model was calibrated for the condition of real foam in the 130 m 3 industrial cell. The recovery of liquid and solid mineral by dragging in the foam, (in types of sizes) was determined. Results were appropriately compared to the determination of dragging by material balance, from the direct measuring of bubble load. This result enabled validating the assumption set out for calculating recovery of floatable mineral in foam. A methodology was developed for production and storage of Br- 82 radioactive gas, which allows studying transport and mixing of gases in industrial flotation equipments. The system was applied in the El Teniente mine for the characterization of the gas phase in 130 m 3 cells. The gas tracer enabled confirming that there is no gas dragging to the tails in large self-priming cells, and that inner gas recirculation is minimal. The mean gas concentration observed in the cell’s upper zone was of about 14 %. Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica - CONICY...|$|E
