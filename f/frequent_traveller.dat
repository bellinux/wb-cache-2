40|$|SummaryBackgroundA {{main cause}} of {{hepatitis}} A and B infections in European countries is travel to endemic countries. Most research on hepatitis vaccination among travellers from Europe has been conducted in airports or travel clinics, samples which potentially overrepresented <b>frequent</b> <b>travellers.</b> Methods 2102 respondents across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK completed an internet-based questionnaire. Vaccination status, travel to endemic countries, and other characteristics were compared across frequent, occasional, and non-travellers. Logistic regressions tested association between vaccination and travel adjusting for potential confounders. ResultsMost respondents were occasional travellers (61 %) and 24 % were <b>frequent</b> <b>travellers.</b> <b>Frequent</b> <b>travellers</b> had 2. 3 – 2. 4 times the odds of being vaccinated relative to non-travellers, and odds of vaccination were 2. 5 – 3. 1 times higher among travellers to endemic areas relative to others (all p < . 05). <b>Frequent</b> <b>travellers</b> were more aware of their vaccination status (HAV: 80 % vs. 72 %; HBV: 82 % vs. 74 %), though many who were vaccinated could not identify the number of injections to complete the series (47 % vs. 29 %) (all p < . 05). ConclusionTravel frequency and destination endemicity are associated with increased hepatitis A and B vaccination. The number of unvaccinated travellers {{and the lack of}} recall for the dosing schedule suggest the need to improve travellers' awareness and adherence to recommendations...|$|R
