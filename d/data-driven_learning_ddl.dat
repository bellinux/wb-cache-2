It is also possible for the teacher to use a concordancer to find examples of authentic usage to demonstrate a point of grammar or typical collocations, and to generate exercises based on the examples found. Various types of concordancers and where they can be obtained are described by Lamy & Klarskov Mortensen (2011).|$|E

40|$|International audienceCorpus {{linguistics}} {{has generated}} {{much interest in}} language teaching and learning, for improved language descriptions {{but also as a}} methodology in discovering language for specific purposes where generic tools do not have all the answers. Often known as <b>data-driven</b> <b>learning</b> or <b>DDL</b> (Johns 1990), the underlying philosophy has remained largely unchanged over several decades, but has not made major inroads into mainstream teaching. Drawing on Kilgarriff et al. (2015), this paper supports three major maxims for corpus use: don’t scare the students; use it when it’s useful; connect it to existing practice. We begin with suggestions for use of familiar technology, especially from the internet, which may progress to searching online corpora, and even to building tailored corpora for long-term specific needs. We end with an overview of research to date based on a meta-analysis of DDL, singling out ESP/EAP and moderator variables which provide not only an overview of lessons learned but also suggestions for the future...|$|R
40|$|Exploring Academic English is an {{innovative}} concordance-based workbook for use either in an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) writing class or for independent learning. What makes it innovative {{is that it}} is the first workbook to utilize corpus study methods to systematically introduce and explore the use of certain words to perform rhetorical functions in academic written English. Thus, it should be of interest to both native and non-native speakers of English, who have at least intermediate proficiency in English, and who are preparing to enter, or already have entered, tertiary education. There are two ways that linguistic corpora can be exploited for pedagogical purposes (Partington, 1998) : teachers can either analyse corpora for material/syllabus design (Flowerdew, 1993), or they can train students to use corpora directly. The latter use is designed to promote what Tim Johns has described as <b>data-driven</b> <b>learning,</b> or <b>DDL.</b> 1 Exploring Academic English offers an interesting combination of both methods.

40|$|A common {{critique}} of <b>data-driven</b> <b>learning</b> (<b>DDL)</b> and the direct use of corpora {{in the classroom}} is that many, if not most, of the corpora available today are inappropriate for language learners because the level of the language in them is too high and the language fragments presented in concordance lines confuse learners.

40|$|The use of corpora in {{language}} teaching and <b>learning</b> (<b>data-driven</b> <b>learning,</b> or <b>DDL)</b> has generated considerable interest {{over the last}} two decades. However, a survey of this research shows a surprising lack of empirical studies regarding the key question of whether corpus use leads to effective language learning. We look first at a series of studies of our own focusing on lower-level learners' ability to exploit concordances for specific linguistic outcomes in English. In line with other studies, we find that: (a) the results are generally positive (i. e. learning happens); while (b) the impact of corpus use appears to be smaller than might have been hoped. We go on to suggest that this may be one explanation for the paucity of published empirical research in DDL. Although DDL might not reveal dramatic results overall, it might be that it is appropriate for certain types of learner or certain types of activity, and thus could form part of the general collection of techniques available. More importantly, even if immediate results in experimental conditions are mitigated, it may be that students can become “better learners” as a result of corpus investigation and corpus techniques. This possibility was examined in a second study involving French corpora in a sociolinguistics course. The participants typically felt that their language mastery and also general awareness and understanding of language issues improved as a result of corpus work. In terms of language pedagogy, we suggest that DDL is beneficial for developing learner autonomy, promoting long-term learning precisely because an inductive DDL approach leads to greater awareness of the types of problems that learners are faced with...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{research}} {{over the}} last few years has shown that large electronic corpora can contribute to the major questions in foreign language teaching and learning of a) what to teach and b) how to teach it. For the “what” question, corpora can be used to provide information on frequency and patterns of form, meaning and use. For the “how” question, learners can be given access to corpora which they are encouraged to explore directly or indirectly in an approach known as <b>data-driven</b> <b>learning</b> or <b>DDL.</b> However, the “what” question has found its way into mainstream teaching practices, while the “how” question remains largely the preserve of individual researchers within a university environment. This imbalance is reflected in the different uptake by publishers: reference materials – dictionaries, grammars and usage manuals – and also in some cases textbooks increasingly claim to be corpus-informed or corpus-based, with more coverage of high frequency items, greater focus on usage, collocation and context, and the increased use of authentic examples taken from the corpora. On the other hand, there are remarkably few truly DDL materials available “off-the-peg” (i. e. ready for immediate use by regular teachers), whether on the market or on line, and DDL activities are completely absent from most major textbooks. In this paper, we begin by examining objections to DDL cited in various studies and reported by our own students, and find that they largely revolve around practical or technical concerns linked to direct interaction with the computer; sometimes, it seems, new technologies are not necessarily better. Paper-based materials might provide one partial solution, an approach adopted in several empirical studies summarised here, including work with our own learners. We argue that the increased availability of off-the-peg materials is likely to be crucial if DDL is to break out of its research confines and make substantial inroads into the wider teaching community. We therefore review various existing DDL materials, both published and on line, with particular consideration to their use by “non-specialist” users, whether teachers or learners. We discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of creating general-purpose materials of this type, and finally present a number of steps needed to increase interest from publishers...|$|R
