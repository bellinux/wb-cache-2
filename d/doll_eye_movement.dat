40|$|Background: Neurotrauma {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} causes of death and disability. Some of the severely head injured patients, failed to show significant improvement despite aggressive neurosurgical management and ended up in a vegetative state. Aims: To assess the outcome at six months and one year using Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), in this prospective study on patients with severe head injury, who remained vegetative at one month. Materials and Methods: This prospective study was carried out in the department of Neurosurgery, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, over a period of a year and a half (March 2002 through July 2003). Materials and Methods: In patients with severe head injury (GCS < 8), post resuscitation, neurological assessment was done with Glasgow coma scale (GCS), pupillary light reflex, <b>doll′s</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> and cold caloric test in all cases. Fifty patients, who remained vegetative post injury according to the criteria of Jennett and Plum, at one month, were considered for the study. Brain SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed T omography) Scanning was carried out in selected cases. Statistical analysis: Data analysis was done by Pearson′s chi-square test on computer software SPSS, Version 10 (California, USA). Results: Patients with preserved brainstem reflex and with no perfusion defect on SPECT scan had statistically significant favorable outcome. More than 40 % of vegetative patients regained consciousness by the end of one year, of whom 24 % had favorable outcome in the form of moderate disability and good recovery. Conclusion: SPECT is better than computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) as it assesses the cerebral perfusion and functional injury rather than detecting the lesions only. Further study with a control group is necessary to establish the role of SPECT in head injury...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} element in the treatment with <b>Eye</b> <b>Movement</b> Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is to make horizontal <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> while retrieving unpleasant autobiographical memories.

However, it is unknown what the effect of the dosage of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> is to the reduction of vividness and emotionality. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if a larger dose of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> has more effect on the reduction of vividness and emotionality than a lower dose of <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> Participants were divided into two groups of four blocks (N= 21) or 8 blocks (N= 22) for 24 seconds in which one had to retrieve a negative memory.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The {{research}} {{developed a}} methodology to code and quantify <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> patterns {{as a function}} of a neuro-linguistic programming strategy elicitation process. Secondarily the research established methodology that identified the degree of consistency among certain certified Neuro-Linguistic Programming Practitioners while they rated <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> The study reviewed literature in the field, identified problems relevant to research in NLP, defined and described selected rater strategies, and utilized {{the findings of this study}} to identify areas which are in need of further research. Fifteen Certified Neuro-Linguistic Programming Practitioners viewed a videotape of 10 Oregon State University students who had been videotaped from the eyes upward while spelling 10 words. Practitioners observed <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> of the videotaped students and these were recorded on Individual Rater Charts, with up to seven possible <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> notations recorded for each spelling task. Subsequent analysis of these notations provided overall agreement figures among the raters by Eye Movement,¹ a grand mean which reflected agreement among raters over all <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> and spelling tasks, and Z scores associated with each of the overall ratings by <b>Eye</b> <b>Movement.</b> Greatest agreement among raters was found for the first observed <b>Eye</b> <b>Movement,</b> where overall agreement exceeded the grand mean. Overall agreement for the second observed <b>Eye</b> <b>Movement</b> fell below the grand mean. Overall agreement for subsequent <b>Eye</b> <b>Movements</b> generally increased through <b>Eye</b> <b>Movement</b> 6 and then showed a slight decrease for <b>Eye</b> <b>Movement</b> 7. This increase in agreement for later <b>Eye</b> <b>Movements</b> was largely attributed to what is termed the "NA-effect," which can result in high agreement scores in cases where only one or a few raters note an <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> while all other raters note no <b>eye</b> <b>movement,</b> and can result in inflated overall agreement scores when the proportion of such cases related to a particular <b>Eye</b> <b>Movement</b> is high in relation to total number of recorded observations associated with the <b>Eye</b> <b>Movement.</b> Anticipated Findings 1, 2 and 3 were not supported by this study, with overall rater agreement lower than predicted for <b>Eye</b> <b>Movements</b> 1 and 2 and higher than predicted for remaining <b>Eye</b> <b>Movements.</b> Anticipated Finding 4 was confirmed by the study, with total number of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> observed by all raters for a particular subject found to be inversely correlated with overall agreement among raters in rating that subject. Anticipated Finding 5 was neither supported nor unsupported by the study, since, due to restraints, an appropriate methodology for testing this prediction was not available. Footnote: ¹ An important terminological distinction should be made. Whereas the term 'eye movements' (in all lower case letters) refers to the particular <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> displayed by individuals performing particular spelling tasks, the term 'Eye Movements' (with first letters capitalized) refers to the ordered set (from 1 through 7) of schema wherein observed <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> are recorded and ordered. Thus, 'Eye Movement 7,' for example, refers to a schema wherein are recorded particular <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> observed by raters as being the seventh occurring within a particular spelling task; moreover, since the schema exists even if there is nothing to fill it out, it makes sense to speak about <b>Eye</b> <b>Movement</b> 7 even in cases where no seventh <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> have been observed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPosttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) is effectively treated with <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) with patients making <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> during recall of traumatic memories. Many therapists have replaced <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> with bilateral beeps, {{but there are}} no data on the effects of beeps. Experimental studies suggest that <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> may be beneficial because they tax working memory, especially the central executive component, but the presence/degree of taxation has not been assessed directly. Using discrimination Reaction Time (RT) tasks, we found that <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> slow down RTs to auditive cues (experiment I), but binaural beeps do not slow down RTs to visual cues (experiment II). In an arguably more sensitive “Random Interval Repetition” task using tactile stimulation, working memory taxation of beeps and <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were directly compared. RTs slowed down during beeps, but the effects were much stronger for <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> (experiment III). The same pattern was observed in a memory experiment with healthy volunteers (experiment IV) : vividness of negative memories was reduced after both beeps and <b>eye</b> <b>movements,</b> but effects were larger for <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> Findings support a working memory account of EMDR and suggest that effects of beeps on negative memories are inferior to those of <b>eye</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R
40|$|Mammalian {{sleep is}} not a {{homogenous}} state, and different variables have traditionally been used to distinguish different periods during sleep. Of these variables, <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> {{is one of the}} most paradigmatic, and has been used to differentiate between the so-called rapid <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep periods. Despite this, <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> during sleep are poorly understood, and the behaviour of the oculomotor system remains almost unknown. In the present work, we recorded binocular <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> during the sleep–wake cycle of adult cats by the scleral search-coil technique. During alertness, <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> consisted of conjugated saccades and eye fixations. During NREM sleep, <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were slow and mostly unconjugated. The two eyes moved upwardly and in the abducting direction, producing a tonic divergence and elevation of the visual axis. During the transition period between NREM and REM sleep, rapid monocular <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> of low amplitude in the abducting direction occurred in coincidence with ponto-geniculo-occipital waves. Along REM sleep, the eyes tended to maintain a tonic convergence and depression, broken by high-frequency bursts of complex rapid <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> In the horizontal plane, each <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> in the burst comprised two consecutive movements in opposite directions, which were more evident in the eye that performed the abducting movements. In the vertical plane, rapid <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were always upward.

40|$|The {{properties}} of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> evoked by cerebellar microstimulation were investigated in alert, encephale isole cats. Repetitive stimuli (20 - 500 Hz, 20 - 500 μA) {{were applied to}} the vermis, lobules V-VII with tungsten microelectrodes. Horizontal and vertical DC-EOGs were recorded with a rectigraph. In many cases, the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were also recorded two-dimensionally with an XY-recorder. We analyzed the dependence of the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> on the stimulus parameter, stimulus sites and initial eye positions. 1) Two types of <b>eye</b> <b>movements,</b> saccades and smooth <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were evoked. The sites for the lowest stimulus threshold (about 20 μA) were both in the Purkinje cell layer and the deep layer of the white matter. The types of the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were not dependent upon the stimulus sites. Directions of the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were contingent on the stimulus sites. Horizontal <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were evoked by the stimulation of the lobule VI. The <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> evoked by the stimulation of the lobule V and VII contained predominantly upward and downward components respectively. Straight upward and downward <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were induced by the stimulation of the midline vermis. 2) The velocity and amplitude of the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were not dependent on the stimulus parameters. The peak velocities of saccades increased {{in proportion to the}} amplitude of the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> The amplitude of the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> depended upon the initial positions of the eye in the orbit, and the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> tended to reach the same final goal in the orbit regardless of initial eye positions. 3) Such goal-directed <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were evoked in 80 % of all the stimulus sites. In 70 % of those sites the movements were goal-directed both horizontally and vertically. In the remaining 30 % the movements were goal-directed either horizontally or vertically. The eccentricities of the goal positions increased with stimulus intensity and frequency. The goal positions of the movements evoked by the simultaneous stimuli of the two different sites were obtained by vectorial addition of the two <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> evoked by the stimulation of each site. These results may indicate that the vermis, lobules V-VII {{play an important role in}} the control of eye position in the orbit...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> in face processing {{has been demonstrated}} in recent studies, {{but many of them}} did not take individual differences in <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> into account. To better understand how individual differences in <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> modulate face processing, the studies reported in this thesis used hidden Markov models (HMMs) to analyze <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> in face recognition and face preference tasks. The HMM approach is able discover individually different <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> patterns in a data-driven fashion; it also can reflect both the spatial and the temporal aspects of <b>eye</b> <b>movements,</b> while many other methods are only able to reflect the spatial aspect. In the first study (Chapter 2), the advantage of the HMM approach was demonstrated by analyzing the <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> recorded in a face recognition study. It was found that participants showed holistic and analytic patterns. The second study (Chapter 3) examined whether different <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> patterns during face recognition were associated with different ethnicities and different performance. It was found that ethnicity did not {{play a significant role in}} modulating <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> pattern, but the analytic pattern was associated with significantly better performance. In the third study (Chapter 4), the relationship between <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> and performance was examined in further details; the <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> during the learning phase and the recognition phase of the face recognition experiment were analyzed. It was found that the analytic pattern during the learning phase and the recognition phase were associated with significantly better performance, but whether participants switched pattern for the two phases did not modulate their performance. In the final study (Chapter 5), the relationship between <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> and face preferences were examined through the analysis of the <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> data collected in a two-alternative-forced-choice task. It was found that participants showed different strength of bias toward the preferred alternatives than the non-preferred alternatives.

The final sections consider <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> and reading and language processing and <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> Bringing together cutting edge research from and international team of leading psychologists, neuroscientists, and vision researchers, this book is the definitive reference work in this field. Features The first comprehensive review of <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> research, providing a much needed review of the field Brings together leading researchers from across the world, resulting in an authoritative and state of the art review of a rapidly expandin...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to define {{differences}} between silent and oral reading {{with respect to}} spatial and temporal <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> parameters. <b>Eye</b> <b>movements</b> of 22 German-speaking adolescents (14 females; mean age = 13; 6 years;months) were recorded while reading an age-appropriate text silently and orally. Preschool cognitive abilities were assessed at the participants' age of 5; 7 (years;months) using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children. The participants' reading speed and reading comprehension {{at the age of}} 13; 6 (years;months) were determined using a standardized inventory to evaluate silent reading skills in German readers (Lesegeschwindigkeits- und -verständnistest für Klassen 6 - 12). The results show that (i) reading mode significantly influenced both spatial and temporal characteristics of <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> patterns; (ii) articulation decreased the consistency of intraindividual reading performances with regard to a significant number of <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> parameters; (iii) reading skills predicted the majority of <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> parameters during silent reading, but influenced only a restricted number of <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> parameters when reading orally; (iv) differences with respect to a subset of <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> parameters increased with reading skills; (v) an overall preschool cognitive performance score predicted reading skills at the age of 13; 6 (years;months), but not <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> patterns during either silent or oral reading. However, we found a few significant correlations between preschool performances on subscales of sequential and simultaneous processing and <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> parameters for both reading modes. Overall, the findings suggest that <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> patterns depend on the reading mode. Preschool cognitive abilities were more closely related to <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> patterns of oral than silent reading, while reading skills predicted <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> patterns during silent reading, but less so during oral reading...|$|R
