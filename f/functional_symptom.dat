50|$|A <b>functional</b> <b>symptom</b> is {{a medical}} symptom in an {{individual}} which is very broadly conceived as arising from a problem in nervous system 'functioning' and not due to a structural or pathologically defined disease cause.

40|$|Functional {{symptoms}} {{are a common}} and at times irritating part of family practice. The expedient {{way of dealing with}} these patients is to investigate, prescribe, and reassure that nothing serious is wrong. This reassurance may not be convincing to the patient whose symptom persists. The author reviews the main issues in this field and describes a subset of patients who seem to have identification as the basis for their <b>functional</b> <b>symptom.</b> When cases are of short term, this subset can be handled by the family physician who is aware of the logic behind the functional symptoms in certain cases. An understanding of functional symptoms and a belief in their logic are important dimensions of comprehensive care in family practice...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{clinical outcomes}} of silicone tube intubation {{according to the}} site of resistance to lacrimal duct probing in complete or partial nasolacrimal duct obstruction patients. Methods: This study included 102 eyes of 72 patients who were diagnosed with complete or partial nasolacrimal duct obstruction and who underwent silicone tube intubation. According {{to the site of}} resistant to nasolacrimal duct probing, eyes were divided in-to proximal resistance (Group I), distal resistance (Group II) and both side resistance (Group III). The success rate was esti-mated based on <b>functional</b> (<b>symptom</b> relief) and anatomical (normalization of tear meniscus) success. Results: The success rates in Group I, Group II, and Group III were 53. 1 %, 78. 8 %, and 27. 0 %, respectively, showing that Group II attained the highest success rate (Pearson chi-square test, p = 0. 001). Conclusions: In cases of only distal resistance to lacrimal probing without dacryocystography, silicone tube intubation should be performed with expectation of good clinical outcomes, even if complete nasolacrimal obstruction was suspected on syringing.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{similarity}} between the reported effects of hyperventilation and recurrent <b>functional</b> <b>symptom</b> presented in primary care, a study was undertaken to establish whether such symptoms are attributable to hyperventilation. Twenty patients with two or more recurrent functional symptoms which their doctors found difficult to diagnose or treat, and 30 controls, were studied using symptom questionnaires {{and a series of}} hyperventilation provocation tests during which the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2) and symptoms were recorded. Sixteen cases (80 %) had unexplained breathlessness compared with two of the controls (7 %). All of the cases recognized familiar functional symptoms during provoked hyperventilation, and in 16 (80 %), these included primary physical symptoms; only 23 % of the controls recognized any previously experienced symptom. Considerable overlap of PCO 2 values between groups meant that absolute values of PCO 2 were not useful in differentiating between groups, but cases were more likely than controls to have a PCO 2 of less than 4 kPa at rest, three minutes after hyperventilation, or during mental stress (75 % of cases fulfilled {{one or more of these}} criteria versus 40 % of controls). This is the first study in primary care to examine the effect of hyperventilation in a group of patients with multiple somatic symptoms.

40|$|Although the {{diagnostic}} criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS) {{have become more}} formalized and sensitive {{in the era of}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, the assessment of individual relapses may not always be straightforward or easily linked to a particular lesion seen on imaging. In addition, acute episodes often have to be assessed outside of normal working hours or when the individual patients usual medical team is not available. Often the emergency department physicians have little formal neurological training and are under time pressure to get patients through the system as quickly as possible. It is therefore possible to mislabel <b>functional</b> <b>symptoms</b> as being true relapses. To illustrate scenarios of possible pseudo-relapse, three clinical vignettes are described. Misclassification of <b>functional</b> <b>symptoms</b> as relapse carries a number of inherent risks. <b>Functional</b> <b>symptoms</b> can be multifactorial and may cause a burden of disease. A multidisciplinary approach may be useful in minimizing unnecessary harm and identify if there is more than meets the eye to an episode of clinical deterioration...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Reliable {{longitudinal}} data {{of patients with}} <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> in general practice are lacking. AIMS: To identify distinctive features in patients with chronic <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms,</b> and to determine whether these symptoms support the hypothesis {{of the existence of}} specific somatic syndromes. Design of study: Observational study, with a comparison control group. SETTING: Four primary care practices affiliated with the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands. METHOD: One hundred and eighty-two patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2002 as having chronic <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> and 182 controls matched by age, sex, socioeconomic status, and practice were included. Data on comorbidity, referrals, diagnostic tests, and hospital admissions over a period of 10 years prior to the diagnosis were collected. Medication use and number of visits to the general practitioner (GP) were extracted from the moment computerised registration was started. RESULTS: In the 10 years before the diagnosis of chronic <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms,</b> significantly more patients than controls presented <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> in at least two body systems, and used more somatic and psychotropic drugs. They visited the GP twice as much, statistically had significantly more psychiatric morbidity, and were referred more often to mental health workers and somatic specialists. The number of patients undergoing diagnostic tests was higher for patients with chronic <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> than for controls, but hospital admissions rates were equal. CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> have a great diversity of <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms.</b> They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Stress, pain, injury, and {{psychological}} trauma all induce arousal-mediated changes in brain network organization. The associated, {{high level of}} arousal may disrupt motor-sensory processing and result in aberrant patterns of motor function, including <b>functional</b> neurological <b>symptoms.</b> We used the auditory oddball paradigm to assess cortical arousal {{in children and adolescents}} with <b>functional</b> neurological <b>symptom</b> disorder. Method: Electroencephalogram (EEG) data was collected in fifty-seven children and adolescents (41 girls; 16 boys, aged 8. 5 – 18  years) with acute <b>functional</b> neurological <b>symptoms</b> and age- sex- matched controls during a conventional auditory oddball task. The high-resolution fragmentary decomposition technique was used to analyse the amplitude of event-related potentials (ERPs) to target tones at midline sites (Fz, Cz, and Pz). Results: Compared to age- and sex-matched controls, and across all three midline sites, children and adolescents with <b>functional</b> neurological <b>symptoms</b> showed increased amplitude of all ERP components (P 50, N 100, P 200, N 200, and P 300) (t-value range 2. 28 – 8. 20; p value-range 0. 023 to < 0. 001) to the emotionally-neutral auditory stimulus. Conclusions: Our findings add to a growing literature indicating that a baseline state of high arousal may be a precondition for generating <b>functional</b> neurological <b>symptoms,</b> a finding that helps explain why a range of psychological and physiological stressors can trigger <b>functional</b> neurological <b>symptoms</b> in some patients. Interventions that target cortical arousal may be central to the treatment of paediatric patients with <b>functional</b> neurological <b>symptom</b> disorder...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine whether}} school {{absenteeism}} is a perpetuating factor of <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> and whether this {{holds true for}} bullied adolescents. STUDY DESIGN: This study {{is part of the}} longitudinal population-based study Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey.

RESULTS: With structural equation modeling, school absenteeism at the second wave, adjusted for <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> at the second wave, was reavealed to predict <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> at the third wave in the entire cohort (beta = 0. 12; 95 % CI, 0. 02 - 0. 22), but not in the subgroup of bullied adolescents (beta = - 0. 13; 95 % CI, - 0. 62 [...] 0. 26). However, the difference between bullied and unbullied adolescents did not reach significance. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that school absenteeism is a perpetuating factor of <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> in adolescents.

40|$|AbstractThe authors {{report a}} case of {{unilateral}} <b>functional</b> neurological <b>symptoms</b> (nonepileptic convulsions) in a 38 -year-old man with mild, motor-predominant cerebral palsy. His convulsions are all lateralized to the same side as his paretic limbs. His episodes significantly decreased after several months of weekly psychodynamic-oriented psychotherapy. Functional neurological disorders have been rarely reported in children or adults with cerebral palsy. Among patients with brain injury, right-hemispheric brain disease may be more helpful than either handedness or the side of symptoms in clinically profiling patients with suspected functional disorders. This case raises biomechanistic questions about brain injury, the development of functional disorders, and the lateralization of <b>functional</b> <b>symptoms...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the {{possible}} long-term health consequences of youth unemployment. Research indicates that unemployment may lead to socioeconomic downward mobility and mental health problems, but we still lack knowledge of the long-term health consequences of youth unemployment. This article examines the potential long-term association between youth unemployment and <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> in adulthood.   Methods: The ‘Northern Swedish cohort’ was used with data from five data collections, from 1981 (age 16) until 2007 (age 42). Youth unemployment was measured as months in unemployment between age 16 and 21, and health outcome as <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> (an index of 10 items of self-reported symptoms). Linear regression was used to analyse the relationship between months in youth unemployment and <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> at age 21 and age 42, stratified for women and men and adjusted for potential confounders, such as time spent in education at age 21 and later unemployment between age 21 and 42.   Results: Youth unemployment was significantly related to <b>functional</b> somatic <b>symptoms</b> at age 21 for men after controlling for confounders, but not for women.
