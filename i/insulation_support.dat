40|$|High energy physics {{facilities}} must {{monitor the}} radiation doses received by their personnel. This monitoring {{can only be}} effective if the radiation detection devices can be calibrated with a good degree of accuracy. Radiation fields are usually composed of several types of radiation, including gamma rays, beta radiation, neutrons, etc. The neutron detection instruments respond {{not only to the}} neutrons coming directly from the source but also those scattered from the floor, walls, and ceiling. The amount of neutron scattering varies from site to site depending on the construction materials and layout of the building. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the scattered neutron fraction in the central volume of the calibration mezzanine of the Radiation Physics Calibration Facility (RPCF) at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab).

The sandwich was tested and compared to a non-reinforced PU foam core sandwich in terms of compressive, flexural and cellular properties. The result was a sandwich panel with improved mechanical properties, smaller cell size structure and lower open cell content.  Moreover, the results were evaluated in a material selection process by means of minimizing merit indices.
