5|$|Most of the {{characters}} are fully aware of Veridian's nature, and often try to manipulate the system {{in order to stop}} bad things from <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> (and sometimes to mitigate the evil effects of some of Veridian's projects). They are also all susceptible to the potential rewards the company can offer despite the consequences of their actions, such as the company's attempt to hire Lem's mother, or the company's introduction of scented light bulbs with known flaws. Much of the comedy of the show comes from {{the characters}}' navigation of these morally ambiguous areas.|$|E
25|$|More generally, {{the defense}} would be denied to people {{experiencing}} symptoms of intoxication {{who continued to}} consume the spiked drink because {{they ought to have}} known what was <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Equally, if no further consumption occurred but they ought to have recognized that they were affected by an unknown substance, beginning an activity such as driving would not fall within the defense. In other words, the policy underpinning the operation of the law favors the protection of the public as against the interests of an individual who recklessly or with wilful blindness exposes the public to danger.|$|E

50|$|Some {{researchers}} {{have claimed that}} people think good things are more likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> than <b>to</b> others, whereas bad events were less likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> than <b>to</b> others.But others {{have pointed out that}} prior work tended to examine good outcomes that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be common (such as owning one's own home) and bad outcomes that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be rare (such as being struck by lightning).Event frequency accounts for a proportion of prior findings of comparative optimism.

500|$|Earlier {{versions}} of the story featured a sensate from Iraq and more about Whispers, the villain of the show. The show was transformed when the writers decided to limit the storytelling, {{with the exception of}} the opening scene of the first episode, to the perspective of the eight characters. This means that every scene set in San Francisco must be about Nomi, in Chicago about Will and so on. Since the show begins with the characters not knowing what is <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> and without being able to cut e.g. to the villains like a traditional show, the audience starts with the same questions and confusion as the characters do. As the characters slowly begin to understand more about what's <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> over the course of several episodes, the audience does as well, at the same pace. Straczynski notes this type of writing wouldn't work if they were writing for a traditional network. [...] "The first episode is written in a way that you could never do a pilot. With pilots you have to set up all the rules and explain everything to hook people in," [...] said Stranczynski. Instead, taking advantage of the binge-watching model Netflix promotes, the series was written as a continuous 12-hour movie, making it possible to tell the story at a different pace.|$|E
500|$|A {{graduate}} of the [...] University of Melbourne, where she studied medicine and excelled at sports, Mary qualified as a general practitioner in 1921 and became a resident surgeon at Royal Melbourne Hospital. Her work was mainly with poor women, many of whom lived in unsanitary conditions and had inadequate diets. The social mores of the time often kept young women ignorant of matters dealing with sex and pregnancy. She recognised that pregnant women in particular needed more information about what was <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> and provided information on birth control {{at a time when}} many doctors and a large segment of the community were opposed to it. [...] "She broke taboos", Della Hilton later wrote, and [...] "made forbidden subjects not only matters for discussion, but for action".|$|E
500|$|Mary {{joined the}} Melbourne District Nursing Society in 1931 and was its vice {{president}} from 1943 to 1953. She banded together with George Simpson and Victor Wallace {{to establish the}} Women's Welfare Clinic to offer advice on birth control, {{at a time when}} many doctors and a large segment of the community were opposed to it. This clinic functioned for one day a week until 1945 when it was discontinued, as the advice it offered could by then be obtained elsewhere.

50|$|Another {{example of}} {{defensive}} attribution is optimism bias, {{in which people}} believe positive events <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> more often than to others and that negative events <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> less often than to others.

500|$|In 1997, {{researchers}} Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa {{observed that}} studies repeatedly showed that Japanese {{people do not}} seek to maintain and enhance their self-esteem, unlike Europeans and Americans. Whereas research with Western participants found that, on average, people falsely believe they are better than average, that they take credit for successes and blame others for failures, and that they overestimate the chances of good fortune <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> studies with Japanese did not reveal such self-enhancing tendencies. In addition, in cross-cultural studies, Japanese reported self-esteem to be hurt more by failures than boosted by successes, {{the opposite of what}} was reported by Americans. All these studies involved participants being aware that their self-esteem was being evaluated, and hence they are said to be measures of explicit self-esteem. This made Kitayama and Karasawa wonder. It seemed unlikely to them that Japanese have no positive feelings attached to their selves. They hypothesized that somehow Japanese do not allow these feelings to be detected overtly. To test this, they ran two experiments that hid the aim of assessing self-esteem, measuring instead implicit self-esteem. [...] Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to introspection, measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts. The first experiment was a replica of Nuttin's 1987 study of letter preference, looking for an effect tied to letters of the participant's name. The second experiment involved numbers, looking for an effect tied to numbers representing the day of the month a participant was born (between 1 and 31) and the month of their birthday (between 1 and 12).|$|E
500|$|According to the {{response}} by Robert van Voren, Pekhterev {{in his article}} condescendingly argues that the Serbsky Institute was not so bad place and that Nekipelov exaggerates and slanders it, but Pekhterev, by doing so, misses the main point: living conditions in the Serbsky Institute were not bad, those who passed through psychiatric examination there were {{in a certain sense}} [...] "on holiday" [...] in comparison with the living conditions of the Gulag; and all the same, everyone was aware that the Serbsky Institute was more than the [...] "gates of hell" [...] from where people were sent to specialized psychiatric hospitals in Chernyakhovsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Kazan, Blagoveshchensk, and that is not all. Their life was transformed to unimaginable horror with daily tortures by forced administration of drugs, beatings and other forms of punishment. Many went crazy, could not endure what was <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> some even died during the [...] "treatment" [...] (for example, a miner from Donetsk Alexey Nikitin). Many books and memoirs are written about the life in the psychiatric Gulag and every time when reading them a shiver seizes us. The Soviet psychiatric terror in its brutality and targeting the mentally ill as the most vulnerable group of society had nothing on the Nazi euthanasia programs. The punishment by placement in a mental hospital was as effective as imprisonment in Mordovian concentration camps in breaking persons psychologically and physically. The recent history of the USSR should be given a wide publicity to immunize society against possible repetitions of the Soviet practice of political abuse of psychiatry. The issue remains highly relevant.|$|E

2500|$|Madonna's Russian {{shows in}} Moscow and Saint Petersburg {{were met with}} great controversy.

[...] During her Moscow show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying [...] "...My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but I think that these three girls -- Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria -- have done something courageous.

[...] Madonna later appeared on stage with a temporary tattoo that said [...] "Pussy Riot" [...] on her back in place of the usual [...] "No Fear" [...] slogan, and performed [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark. It was considered an artistic statement against the oppression of the band's freedom of speech.|$|E

Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her in support of the band, among them Yoko Ono, Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, however, wrote an expletive-ridden Twitter post lambasting Madonna for backing the band: [...] "With age, every ex-slut tends to lecture everybody on morality. Especially during world tours and concerts." [...] Madonna's second Russian date in Saint Petersburg was consequently met with terrorist threats, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a warning to those in attendance. Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg responded that the concert would go on as scheduled and that Russian authorities would step up security for the date. Following threats of arrest by Russian officials if she spoke in support of gay rights and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits [...] "public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and transgenderism among minors", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website saying she was a [...] "freedom fighter" [...] and would defend LGBT rights. Before the show, Madonna released pink wristbands to audience members in support of the LGBT community. In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout.|$|E
