25|$|Keelmen were {{traditionally}} {{bound to}} employment for a year, the binding day normally being Christmas Day but employment {{tended to be}} seasonal with hardly any work in winter. The availability of work was often affected by the weather, if ships were unable {{to come into the}} river, and also by the supply of coal from the pits. Strikes might affect output and wily pit owners would sometimes curtail production to keep prices high. As a result, keelmen could spend long periods without work, during which they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on credit or find employment in clearing wrecks and sand banks from the river. The Tyneside keelmen formed an independent society in 1556 but were never incorporated, probably because the Newcastle Hostmen feared their becoming too powerful. The Wearside keelmen were finally incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1792.|$|E
