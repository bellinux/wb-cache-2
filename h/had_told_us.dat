[...] According to writer Cintra Wilson, [...] "English newspaper photographers showed up when S were thrown out of the London Hilton [...] the night they arrived—literally overnight, they were stars. London went gaga for the heretofore-unseen S look, which was neither mod nor rocker." ...|$|E

[...] This amount was immediately paid by UCC to the Indian government. The company states that the restitution paid [...] "was $120 million more than plaintiffs' lawyers <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>U.S.</b> courts was fair" [...] and that the Indian Supreme Court stated in its opinion that [...] "compensation levels under the settlement were far greater than would normally be payable under Indian law." ...|$|E

40|$|Combined {{with the}} {{shortcomings}} of the media’s reporting, the government’s weaknesses are hiding some pretty good news, writes Rodney Tiffen in Inside StoryTHINK {{for a moment about}} all we have learned about Kevin Rudd over the past few weeks. An eminent author, David Marr, <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> the PM is motivated primarily by anger, stemming from a traumatic period in his childhood. A voice coach <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> he <b>has</b> an unpleasant voice. Retailer Gerry Harvey <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> Rudd and his government are hopeless salesmen. Billionaire miner “Twiggy” Forrest <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> he is taking the country in a communist direction. And his brother Greg  <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> he is not impressed by the job Rudd is doing as prime minister. This is the man who a year ago was still enjoying record approval ratings, having won a sweeping election victory eighteen months earlier. His prolonged honeymoon was accompanied by extravagant flattery, praising his political genius, his capacious work ethic, his ability to mix social vision with practical politics. The turnaround could hardly be more complete. It is another case supporting the view that the media are either [...] . Read the full articlePhoto: Drew Douglas/ Flick...|$|R
2500|$|In early 1957, Presley {{gave his}} parents, Vernon and Gladys Presley, a $100,000 budget, {{and asked them}} to find a [...] "farmhouse" [...] type {{property}} to purchase. At the time, Graceland was located several miles beyond Memphis' main urban area. In later years, Memphis would expand with housing, resulting in Graceland being surrounded by other properties. Presley purchased Graceland on March 19, 1957 for the amount of $102,500. Later that year, Presley invited Richard Williams and Buzz Cason [...] "to get a close look at this mansion Elvis <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> about. ... We proceeded to clown around on the front porch, striking our best rock 'n' roll poses and snapping pictures with the little camera. We peeked in the not-yet-curtained windows and {{got a kick out of}} the pastel colored walls in the front rooms with shades of bright reds and purples that Elvis most certainly had picked out." [...] Elvis was fond of claiming that the US government had mooted a visit to Graceland by Nikita Khrushchev, 'to see how in America a fellow can start out with nothing and, you know, make good'.|$|E
2500|$|Cinematographer Adam Greenberg, whose {{previous}} film credits included Three Men and a Baby, La Bamba and Near Dark, {{approached the}} film {{with a unique}} documentary-style technique. Commenting on the initial photography lighting tests, Greenberg remarked, [...] "The first ones were a disaster. They didn't look good at all. I didn't know how to photograph these aliens. It {{was the first time}} I had to deal with this kind of thing. But I have an eye and I learned from these tests." [...] At the Biltmore Hotel, a peculiar situation arose where the ceilings were simply too tall for standard lighting equipment. An ingenious idea was devised by the crew to have six to eight weather balloons sent up and have artificial light bounce off of them to create the proper lighting mood. Greenberg remarked, [...] "I wanted a very rich look from that place, gold and very warm. In the story it is very late after a big party. I wasn't going for any special effect, just nice light from lamps on the tables. The problem was, the hotel management wouldn't let us hang anything from the ceiling. In pre-production they <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> we could hang lights, but I didn't believe them. The ceilings there are very high and very beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 11, the {{day after}} the hijackers had disembarked the ship, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak lied to the media when asked about them saying they had left within hours of coming ashore, [...] "They have {{actually}} left Egypt. I do not know exactly where they have gone. Perhaps they have left for Tunisia." [...] His foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid reiterated the same message [...] "They left Egypt. I know where they are, but I am not going to tell you." [...] Mubarak would also falsely insist that the hijackers had left Egypt before he had information about Captain De Rosa's correction, [...] "If the captain <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that a passenger had been killed, we would have changed our position toward the whole operation. But when this [...] emerged, we already had sent the hijackers out of the country." [...] Mubarak also repeated the suggestion that no one had been killed [...] "There is no body and no proof he has been murdered. Maybe the man is hiding or did not board the ship at all." [...] At the time of Mubarak's statements to the news media, the U.S. Administration had already received intelligence information that the hijackers were still in Egypt.|$|E
