2500|$|In its North American years, as its celebrity grew, the quartet's members {{naturally}} {{associated with}} notable musicians such as Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Mischa Elman, and—not surprisingly, given the quartet’s Belgian connections—Eugène Ysaÿe. The group also, however, had less obvious associations {{with the famous}} of its day. In one colorful incident, as the quartet toured during the 1916–1917 season, it crossed paths with the famous deafblind author, activist, and lecturer Helen Keller and her teacher and companion Anne Sullivan in Oklahoma City, where Keller was scheduled for a lecture. Keller proposed as an experiment that the quartet should play for her, to determine whether she could sense music; readily acceding to her request, the quartet played music including the celebrated second movement, andante cantabile, from Tchaikovsky’s String Quartet no. 1 in D Major, op. 11, as she held <b>her</b> <b>fingertips</b> lightly on a resonant tabletop.

2500|$|A {{shadow of}} Dark Willow appears to fight Glory {{in the fifth}} season episode [...] "Tough Love", {{but she does not}} come into full force until the sixth season in [...] "Villains", [...] "Two to Go", and [...] "Grave". The {{transition}} from Willow into Dark Willow, precipitated by Tara's immediate death when she is shot through the heart, was ambiguously received by audiences, many of whom never foresaw Willow's psychic break. It was simultaneously lauded for being an overwhelming depiction of a powerful woman, and derided as representative of a worn cliché that lesbians are amoral and murderous. Dark Willow proved to be exceptionally more powerful than Buffy. She changes visually when she walks into the Magic Box, a store owned by Anya and Giles, telekinetically retrieves dozens of dark magic books from the shelves, and leeches the words from the pages with <b>her</b> <b>fingertips.</b> As the words crawl up her arms and soak into her skin, her eyes and hair become black and her posture [...] "aggressively aware and confident".|$|E

30|$|The two {{subsystems}} of the Portable Oxygen Administration System were {{integrated and}} tested against the required functionalities. To check {{the capability of}} the developed model in measuring the oxygen saturation level and the heart rate, measurements were compared to the PPG measurements from the commercial Pulse Oximeter (H 100 B) by conducting experimental measurements using the set up in Fig. 16. The experiment {{was conducted on the}} same person at the same time, where <b>her</b> <b>fingertip</b> of left hand was placed in the SpO_ 2 sensor for the commercial Pulse Oximeter and the <b>her</b> <b>fingertip</b> of the right hand was placed in the SpO_ 2 sensor of the oxygen Reader Subsystem as shown in Fig. 16 a. Measurements were read from both system is shown in Fig. 16 b. The experiment was repeated on different people. The experiments showed very good agreement between the SpO_ 2 and heart rate measurements from our system and from the commercial Pulse-Oximeter (H 100 B) (see Fig. 15). The developed prototype shows good agreements for SpO_ 2 and heart rate measurements when compared to the Commercial Pulse Oximeter. The agreement was good despite the need for our system to be calibrated based on experimental measurements. During next phase of this project, we will calibrate our developed system by conducting experimental measurements on different patients at hospital settings.|$|R

After a period of smoldering animosity, Selma makes overtures to befriend Iris, but then beats her with a switch (stem) when Iris asks about Bianca's nightly departures. Selma also uses <b>her</b> <b>fingertip,</b> touching Iris's wound, to gingerly taste Iris's blood. As time passes, Laura, unlike Iris, is morose and unable to adapt to life at the school.

40|$|Introduction. Digital {{ischemia}} {{is a rare}} {{complication of}} several chemotherapeutic medications.

Digital subtraction angiography revealed severe vascular resistance in the affected extremity. Iloprost trometamol treatment was started with the dosage of 1 [*]ng/kg/min. In addition, low-molecule-weight heparin was used for preventing possible microemboli. Symptomatic relief was provided after five days, and patient was discharged on 7 th day of treatment. Discussion. The pathogenesis of oxaliplatin induced vascular toxicity remains unclear. Endothelial damage, increased adherence of platelets, deposition of immune complexes as an immunologic effect of oxaliplatin, and hypercoagulable state may be the reason for arterial thrombosis, digital microemboli, possible digital ischemia, and their several consequences...|$|R

The chest, the leather bunk, a dress or two of hers hanging on pegs--there was no place where the merest hazard might not guide Heyst's hand at any moment. Her wildly roaming eyes were caught by the half-closed window. She ran to it, and by raising herself on her toes was able to reach the shutter with <b>her</b> <b>fingertips.</b> She pushed it square, stole back {{to the middle of the}} room, and, turning about, swung her arm, regulating the force of the throw so as not to let the slipper fly too far out and hit the edge of the overhanging eaves. It was a task of the nicest judgement for the muscles of those round arms, still quivering from the deadly wrestle with a man, for that brain, tense with the excitement of the situation and for the unstrung nerves flickering darkness before her eyes. At last the slipper left her hand. As soon as it passed the opening, it was out of her sight. She listened. She did not hear it strike anything; it just vanished, as if it had wings to fly on through the air. Not a sound! It had gone clear.|$|E

And then the moon would rise and I would look around me [...] . {{and there would be no}} Hester Gray and no little vine-hung house, and no roses [...] . only an old waste garden starred with June lilies amid the grasses, and the wind sighing, oh, so sorrowfully in the cherry trees.

His dear mistress bade him farewell with a cheerful face; her blessing he knew he had always, and wheresoever fate carried him. Mistress Beatrix was away in attendance on her Majesty at Hampton Court, and kissed her fair fingertips to him, by way of adieu, when he rode thither to take his leave. She received her kinsman in a waiting-room, where there were half a dozen more ladies of the Court, so that his high-flown speeches, had he intended to make any (and very likely he did), were impossible; and she announced to her friends that her cousin was going to the army, in as easy a manner as she would have {{said he was going to}} a chocolate-house. He asked with a rather rueful face, if she had any orders for the army? and she was pleased to say that she would like a mantle of Mechlin lace. She made him a saucy curtsy in reply to his own dismal bow. She deigned to kiss <b>her</b> <b>fingertips</b> from the window, where she stood laughing with the other ladies, and chanced to see him as he made his way to the [...] "Toy." [...] The Dowager at Chelsey was not sorry to part with him this time. [...] "Mon cher, vous etes triste comme un sermon," [...] she did him the honor to say to him; indeed, gentlemen in his condition are by no means amusing companions, and besides, the fickle old woman had now found a much more amiable favorite, and raffoled for her darling lieutenant of the Guard. Frank remained behind for a while, and did not join the army till later, in the suite of his Grace the Commander-in-Chief. His dear mother, on the last day before Esmond went away, and when the three dined together, made Esmond promise to befriend her boy, and besought Frank to take the example of his kinsman as of a loyal gentleman and brave soldier, so she was pleased to say; and at parting, betrayed not the least sign of faltering or weakness, though, God knows, that fond heart was fearful enough when others were concerned, though so resolute in bearing its own pain.|$|E
