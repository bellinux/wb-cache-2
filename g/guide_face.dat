The survey includes summaries of analytical studies and theoretical results that were obtained for various transmission line structures. This material was supplemented by further analysis where appropriate. The transmission line structures are evaluated in terms of electrical performance, ease of manufacture, usefulness for building other devices and compatibility with solid state devices. Descriptions of waveguide transmission lines which have commonly been used in the microwave frequency range are provided along with special attention given to the problems that these <b>guides</b> <b>face</b> when their use is extended into the millimeter wave range.

40|$|In this paper, {{the design}} and {{analysis}} of a novel solid state light tube is presented. The tube is constructed with periodic units of lateral-emitting LEDs. In each unit, two LEDs are mounted on two metal plates, respectively, which are installed at the two ends of a light <b>guide,</b> <b>facing</b> inward to each other. The light emitted from the LEDs firstly transmits in the light guide and then gets outside after reflection and refraction. This light tube structure can provide a more uniform optical field distribution and eliminate the "spotty effect" of commercial LED light tubes. In order to optimize the design, different dimensions of the light guide were studied. A prototype of LED desk lamp using the developed light tube was manufactured. The illumination performance of the lamp was investigated. In addition, an analytical model was developed to facilitate {{the design of the}} light guide. Analytical modeling results and experimental data showed reasonable agreement. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|At {{the very}} early stages of {{original}} design work, the aspects of concept, scheming and analysis tend to merge. It is only as the designer's understanding of the design task increases that these aspects become more substantial and start to separate into distinct activities. The challenge in providing support {{in the early stages}} is that the design, and hence its geometry, is necessarily ill-defined. This paper looks at the use of constraint-based techniques as a design aid. Constraints are more clearly identified as they bound what is possible. They allow an initial model of the design to be created from the little that is known. This can be expanded as the design progresses, and, being constraint-based, previously created parts of the model can be refined in the light of subsequent design progress. These ideas are illustrated with an application based on the design of an "erection" system for cartons used for packaging. At the start of the design, all that is known is the form of the carton net. This is modelled to determine the required motion. The constraint model is then expanded to consider the basic folding mechanisms and the requirements for <b>guiding</b> <b>faces...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{vulnerability}} of <b>guided</b> transport systems <b>facing</b> natural hazards is a burning {{issue for the}} urban risks management. In this context, several conceptual models of resilience are elaborated for presenting the various possible resilience strategies applied to urban technical systems.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to offer an application of this model to a specific urban technical system, a public <b>guided</b> transport system, <b>facing</b> a particular risk, a flood hazard.

25|$|A kite is a {{tethered}} {{air foil}} that creates both lift and drag, {{in this case}} anchored to a vehicle with a tether, which <b>guides</b> the <b>face</b> of the kite to achieve the best angle of attack. The lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air flows around the kite's surface, producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings. The interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along {{the direction of the}} wind. The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of {{one or more of the}} lines or tethers to which the kite is attached, thereby powering the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|A kite is {{traditionally}} a tethered heavier-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against {{the air to}} create lift and drag. A kite consists of wings, tethers, pulleys, and anchors. Kites often have a bridle to <b>guide</b> the <b>face</b> of the kite at the correct angle so the wind can lift it. A kite's wing also may be so designed so a bridle is not needed; when kiting a sailplane for launch, the tether meets the wing at a single point. A kite may have fixed or moving anchors. Untraditionally in technical kiting, a kite consists of tether-set-coupled wing sets; even in technical kiting, though, a wing in the system is still often called the kite.|$|R
60|$|She {{understood}} the metaphor at once; though indeed {{it would not}} much have troubled me, if she had assented to the literal meaning of my words. The mahogany box {{was placed in a}} proper position, and I peeped in through its small round magnifying window, while the girl sat by my side, and gave short descriptive sketches, as one after another the pictures were unfolded to my view. We visited together, at least our imaginations did, full many a famous city, in the streets of which I had long yearned to tread; once, I remember, we were in the harbor of Barcelona, gazing townwards; next, she bore me through the air to Sicily, and bade me look up at blazing AEtna; then we took wing to Venice, and sat in a gondola beneath the arch of the Rialto; and anon she sat me down among the thronged spectators at the coronation of Napoleon. But there was one scene, its locality she could not tell, which charmed my attention longer than all those gorgeous palaces and churches, because the fancy hammed me, that I myself, the preceding summer, had beheld just such a humble meeting-house, in just such a pine-surrounded nook, among our own green mountains. All these pictures were tolerably executed, though far inferior to the girl's touches of description; nor was it easy to comprehend, how in so few sentences, and these, as I supposed, in a language foreign to her, she contrived to present an airy copy of each varied scene. When we had travelled through the vast extent of the mahogany box, I looked into my <b>guide's</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} a brief {{presentation of the}} different losses developed in high head Francis turbines, where special {{attention is paid to}} the losses in the guide vanes due to the head covers deflection. The different factors determining the extent of the leakage flow are thoroughly examined. Also, since the <b>guide</b> vane <b>facing</b> plate and the head covers are exposed to serious wear due to the presence of sand particles in a high accelerating flow, efficiency measurements of sand eroded and repaired turbines are presented. In addition, results from efficiency measurements of Francis turbines with different clearance gaps are included to underline the severity of the clearance gap between the covers and the guide vanes. The thesis presents a numerical approach to calculate the head covers deflection. And the scope of this work is to develop a simplified 2 -D model, which calculates the head covers deflection within a certain order of accuracy. Thus a 3 -D modelling of the head covers deflection is also included with the purpose of validating the 2 -D modelling. Furthermore, a discussion of the efficiency with respect to the design of the head covers is performed to describe the potential of increasing the hydraulic efficiency by altering the design method. Also, a numerical computation of the leakage flow in the guide vanes due to the head covers deflections, is presented to better visualize the effect from the clearance gap between the head cover and <b>guide</b> vane <b>facing</b> plate. Also, to underline the severity of large clearance gaps, the guide vane has been modeled with four different sized clearance gaps. Finally, an analytical interpretation of the leakage flow is included to evaluate the numerical calculation of the leakage flow.
