5|$|Like other primates, lemurs groom {{socially}} (allogroom) to ease {{tensions and}} solidify relationships. They groom in greeting, when waking up, when settling in for sleep, {{between mother and}} infant, in juvenile relations, and for sexual advances. Unlike anthropoid primates, who part the fur with the hands and pick out particles with the <b>fingers</b> <b>or</b> mouth, lemurs groom with their tongue and scraping with their toothcomb. Despite the differences in technique, lemurs groom with the same frequency and {{for the same reasons}} as anthropoids.|$|E
5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including <b>fingers</b> <b>or</b> penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1907, Kafka {{was hired}} at the , an {{insurance}} company, {{where he worked}} for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a working time schedule—from 08:00 until 18:00—making it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later he found employment more amenable to writing {{when he joined the}} Worker's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for personal injury to industrial workers; accidents such as lost <b>fingers</b> <b>or</b> limbs were commonplace at this time owing to poor work safety policies at the time. It was especially true of factories fitted with machine lathes, drills, planing machines and rotary saws which were rarely fitted with safety guards.|$|E
2500|$|A throw is {{a simple}} metal grip for the player's <b>finger</b> <b>or</b> thumb, {{attached}} to a valve slide. The general term [...] "throw" [...] can describe a u-hook, a saddle (u-shaped grips), or a ring (ring-shape grip) in which a player's <b>finger</b> <b>or</b> thumb rests. A player extends a <b>finger</b> <b>or</b> thumb to lengthen a slide, and retracts the finger to return the slide to its original position.|$|R

5|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} {{is a highly}} venomous snake. The venom {{consists}} of both pre-synaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins (dendrotoxins), cardiotoxins, calcicludine, and fasciculins. The average venom yield per bite is 80mg according to Engelmann and Obst (1981), while Minton (1974) gives it a range of 60–95mg (dry weight). The subcutaneous LD50 is 1.3mg/kg. The LD50 in mice through the IV route is 0.45mg/kg. Like all other mamba species, the toxicity of individual specimens within the same species can vary greatly based on several factors including geographical region, age, seasonal variation, diet, and so on. Local swelling is variable and sometimes absent after mamba bites. However, patients bitten by the eastern green mamba develop swelling of the entire bitten limb and also show mild haemostatic disturbances (Warrell DA; MacKay et al. 1966). The rare cases of local tissue damage usually resulted from bites on the <b>fingers</b> <b>or</b> {{the use of a}} tight tourniquet. This species has caused bites to humans and many of the bites attributed to this species have often resulted in fatalities. The mortality rate of untreated bites is unknown but is thought to be quite high. Symptoms of envenomation by this species include swelling of the bite site, dizziness, and nausea, accompanied by difficulty breathing and swallowing, irregular heartbeat, convulsions, rapid progression to respiratory paralysis. Bites that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal. Case reports of rapidly fatal outcomes, in as little as 30 minutes, have been recorded for this species.|$|E

50|$|Trauma to the <b>finger</b> <b>or</b> {{the hand}} {{is quite common}} in society. In some {{particular}} cases, the entire finger {{may be subject to}} amputation. The majority of traumatic injuries are work-related. Today, skilled hand surgeons can sometimes reattach the <b>finger</b> <b>or</b> thumb using microsurgery. Sometimes, traumatic injuries may result in loss of skin, and plastic surgeons may place skin and muscle grafts.|$|R
25|$|Masturbation {{involves}} touching, pressing, rubbing or massaging a person's genital area, {{either with}} the <b>fingers</b> <b>or</b> against an object {{such as a}} pillow; inserting <b>fingers</b> <b>or</b> an object into the vagina or anus (see anal masturbation); and stimulating the penis or vulva with an electric vibrator, which may also be inserted into the vagina or anus. It may also involve touching, rubbing, or pinching the nipples or other erogenous zones while masturbating. Both sexes sometimes apply lubricating substances to intensify sensation.|$|E

25|$|Cymbals {{are usually}} muted with the <b>fingers</b> <b>or</b> hand, {{to reduce the}} length or volume of ringing (e.g., the cymbal choke {{technique}} which is {{a key part of}} heavy metal drumming).

25|$|The prima balalaika, secunda and alto {{are played}} either with the <b>fingers</b> <b>or</b> a {{plectrum}} (pick), {{depending on the}} music being played, and the bass and contrabass (equipped with extension legs that rest on the floor) are played with leather plectra.

Some men also enjoy anal stimulation, with <b>fingers</b> <b>or</b> otherwise, without any prostate stimulation.|$|E
