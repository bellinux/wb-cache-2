Although designed with the Japanese keijidōsha light automobile class in mind, the attention it generated led to its subsequent introduction in right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> markets in Asia, Oceania and Europe.

25|$|The Supreme series {{like the}} Panorama I and Panorama Elite were simply a success {{from the outset}} winning many orders from small, national, and some {{international}} operators. It entered most fleets in large multiples. The export market was addressed with left <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> versions, some modified for the Dutch market {{and at least one}} was built on Deutz chassis. The dynamic approach of Plaxtons relationship with their customers requirements was a huge factor in the success of the Supreme.|$|E
25|$|Lancia's {{reputation}} was significantly undermined in 1980, when defective Lancia Beta models, suffering from significant suspension sub-frame corrosion problems, were purchased back from owners {{by the company}} in a highly publicised campaign. These cars were subsequently crushed. The brand never recovered from the damage inflicted during the Beta recall and, combined {{with a range of}} related factors (including poor residual values, which made their range uncompetitive), decided to withdraw from the right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> market in February 1994. The last model be sold in the United Kingdom was the Delta, boosted by its rallying reputation, withdrawn from sale in 1995.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme {{was also}} {{manufactured}} as a semi-integral on a DAF chassis. Around 20 were built. They were rear engined and the rear panel design {{was different from}} the Supreme V as it has vents and had odd shaped moulding around the rear window. As a semi-integral the body was required to support the full weight as there were no chassis members to support the body. Opening the side lockers luggage could be piled in one side and extracted from the other as nothing was in the way so it was very cutting edge technology. It is said that 2 of these survive today. The bulk of the 20 were exported, mainly to the Netherlands, the left <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> version had a tapered front to meet Dutch swept turning-circle requirements.|$|E

25|$|In 1987, Ford of Brazil and Ford of Argentina merged their {{operations}} with the Brazilian and Argentine operations of Volkswagen Group, forming a new joint-venture company called Autolatina with a shared model range. Sales figures and profitability were disappointing, and Autolatina was dissolved in 1995. With {{the advent of}} Mercosur, the regional common market, Ford {{was finally able to}} rationalize its product line-ups in those countries. Consequently, the Ford Fiesta and Ford EcoSport are built only in Brazil, and the Ford Focus only built in Argentina, with each plant exporting in large volumes to the neighboring countries. Models like the Ford Mondeo from Europe could now be imported completely built up. Ford of Brazil produces a pick-up truck version of the Fiesta, the Courier, which is also produced in South Africa as the Ford Bantam in right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> versions.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to local}} {{assembly}} {{which began in}} late 1964, small numbers of RHD full imports were sourced through select Australian Ford dealers, and also by Ford of Australia for executive use. RHD wagons, convertibles and fastbacks, 2- and 4-door hardtops, XLs and LTDs were generally sourced as full imports from Ford of Canada until approx 1968. The fully imported 1959 to early 1963 models used a 1959 U.S. Fairlane dashboard and instruments. In late 1963, a 1959 Edsel Corsair-based dashboard was used, and for 1964, a 1959 Edsel Ranger-based dashboard was used. However, some RHD 1963s and 1964s have been photographed with the more attractive U.S.-style 1964 cluster. Australian assembled 1965–1968 models were sourced in CKD form from Ford of Canada. The 1965–1967 model Galaxies adopted the RHD dashboard based on the 1963 Lincoln Continental. The 1967 models got the U.S.-market safety steering wheel with its thickly padded center hub. This wheel was retained for 1968, and the 1968 Torino cluster replaced the Continental version. Some right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> 1967s have been seen with {{a mirror image of}} the US-style instrument panel for that year.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, {{the same}} model was {{exported}} to the Middle East badged as the CSV CR8, albeit in left <b>hand</b> <b>drive.</b> In this instance, CSV stands for [...] "Chevrolet Special Vehicles", {{not to be confused}} with the unrelated, but also Holden Commodore-based Corsa Specialised Vehicles (CSV) cars.|$|E
50|$|An {{aero engine}} inertia starter uses a pre-rotated {{flywheel}} to transfer kinetic {{energy to the}} crankshaft, normally through reduction gears and a clutch to prevent over-torque conditions. Three variations have been used, <b>hand</b> <b>driven,</b> electrically driven and a combination of both. When the flywheel is fully energised either a manual cable is pulled or a solenoid is used to engage the starter.|$|R

Bourn produces a similar patent in the same year.|$|R
40|$|South Africans hold – often {{simultaneously}} – contradictory {{beliefs about}} {{young people and}} politics. On one <b>hand,</b> <b>driven</b> largely by a romanticized memory of Soweto and the street battles of the 1980 s, many people see the youth as the primary catalyst of activism and political change. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>driven</b> by continuing media depictions of youth unemployment, township protests and the antics of the ANC Youth League, {{a wide range of}} commentators routinely experience “moral panics” about the apparent “crisis” of the youth and their corrosive effect on the country’s political culture. In this report, we review a wide range of longitudinal survey data spanning the first two decades of democracy and find that there are indeed a series of real problems with South Africa’s political culture, particularly in the area of citizenship. At the same time, these data clearly show that these problems are largely not peculiar to young people. Across a range of different indicators, we find consistently that there are no, or relatively minor, age profiles to most dimensions of South African political culture...|$|R
