50|$|Currently, {{there are}} no control {{programs}} or vaccines for loiasis. However, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> be in a high-risk area where this parasite inhabits, {{it is suggested that}} you take diethylcarbamazine (DEC)—about 300 mg each week—to reduce your risk. Another way is to avoid areas where the vectors, deer and mango flies, are found. This includes swamps, bogs, and shaded areas near rivers or near wood fires. Ways in which you can minimize fly bites is by using insect repellents such as DEET (N, N-Diethyl-metatoluamide) and to wear clothing that has long sleeves and pants during the daytime. Permethrin treatment on your clothes is an additional repellent that could be used. Also, using malaria nets can also reduce the number of fly bites acquired.|$|E
