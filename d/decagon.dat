Optimus then decides to temporarily take the mantle of leadership. Optimus, Bumblebee, and Optimus' friend Ratchet lead a defensive campaign to protect their home city of Iacon. The trio activate the city's defense guns and reactivate the communication grid. They then travel to the <b>Decagon</b> Plaza where the three Autobots battle the former Autobot Starscream and after severely wounding him, they force him to retreat.|$|E

These are formed using a set of five tile shapes, namely a regular <b>decagon,</b> an elongated hexagon, a bow tie, a rhombus, and a regular pentagon. All the sides of these tiles have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 radians), offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries. The tiles are decorated with strapwork lines (girih), generally more visible than the tile boundaries. In 2007, the physicists Peter Lu and Paul Steinhardt [...] argued that girih resembled quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Elaborate geometric zellige tilework is a distinctive element in Moroccan architecture. Muqarnas vaults are three-dimensional but were designed in two dimensions with drawings of geometrical cells.|$|E

50|$|In four-dimensional {{geometry}} the icosidodecahedron {{appears in}} the regular 600-cell as the equatorial slice that belongs to the vertex-first passage of the 600-cell through 3D space. In other words: the 30 vertices of the 600-cell which lie at arc distances of 90 degrees on its circumscribed hypersphere {{from a pair of}} opposite vertices, are the vertices of an icosidodecahedron. The wire frame figure of the 600-cell consists of 72 flat regular <b>decagons.</b> Six of these are the equatorial <b>decagons</b> to a pair of opposite vertices. They are precisely the six <b>decagons</b> which form the wire frame figure of the icosidodecahedron.|$|R

500|$|Christian mausolea and shrines {{developed}} into the [...] "centralized church" [...] type, {{often with a}} dome over a raised central space. The oblong <b>decagon</b> of today's St. Gereon's Basilica in Cologne, Germany, was built upon an extraordinary and richly decorated 4th century Roman building with an apse, semi-domed niches, and dome. A church built in the city's northern cemetery, its original dedication is unknown. It may have been built by Julianus, the governor of Gaul from 355 to 360 who would later become emperor, as a mausoleum for his family. The oval space may have been patterned after imperial audience halls or buildings such as the Temple of Minerva Medica. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem was likely built with a wooden dome over the shrine {{by the end of}} the 4th century. The rotunda, [...] in diameter and centered on the tomb of Christ, consisted of a domed center room surrounded by an ambulatory. The dome rose over a ground floor, gallery, and clerestory and may have had an oculus. The dome was about [...] wide. Razed to the ground in 1009 by the Fatimid Caliph, it was rebuilt in 1048 by Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, reportedly with a mosaic depicting Christ and the Twelve Apostles. The current dome is a 1977 renovation in thin reinforced concrete.|$|E
