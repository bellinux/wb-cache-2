40|$|In 2005, India amended its Patents Act, 1970 to {{introduce}} TRIPS compliant product patent regime. Generally speaking, {{law and policy}} makers in India {{during the time of}} the amendment were confronted with two major concerns viz. the future of the Indian pharmaceutical industry and access to affordable medicines in India and other developing countries. To address these concerns India along with many other developing countries attempted to incorporate TRIPS <b>flexibilities</b> <b>in</b> their domestic law. However, the success of the TRIPS <b>flexibilities</b> <b>in</b> addressing the question of access to affordable medicines mainly depends on three factors: a) the incorporation of <b>flexibilities</b> <b>in</b> the domestic law; b) the manufacturing capability of a country; and c) the political will to use the public interest safeguards provided in the domestic law. There are only a few countries like India, which satisfy the above-mentioned conditions to a certain extent. This article examines whether these premises hold true after five years into the implementation of the TRIPS compliant patent system in India. In this context the paper identifies and analyzes the legal, policy and institutional challenges that India is currently facing in the implementation of TRIPS flexibilities. It also identifies the main legal, policy and institutional disconnect in the implementation of TRIPS <b>flexibilities</b> <b>in</b> India. It argues that to effectively use TRIPS flexibilities to address access to affordable medicines require changes in three areas viz. law, policy and institutions. It clearly shows that mere incorporation of TRIPS <b>flexibilities</b> <b>in</b> the domestic legislation alone is not enough and the domestic legislation needs to be complemented with policy and institutional framework. ...|$|R
40|$|Stalemate in {{agricultural}} negotiations at the WTO has persisted with a continued lack of convergence on {{most important issues}} of trade-distorting domestic support, market access and related <b>ﬂexibilities</b> <b>in</b> respect of developing countriesâ right to regulate. One of the key issues for negotiations is those around <b>ﬂexibilities</b> <b>in</b> market access, where developing countries, led by the G- 33 group, have articulated their position on the Special Products [SPs] and Special Safeguard Mechanism [SSM]. This paper makes an attempt to designate and categorise the agricultural tariff lines for being earmarked as SPs in India based on development criteria and suggests future options in a scenario of possible tariff reductions. The treatment {{and the percentage of}} lines for special products are still being negotiated and the current paperâs scoring method is an effort in bringing to the fore discussion of <b>ﬂexibilities</b> <b>in</b> market access protecting the interest of developing countries.

5|$|In Greece, Rome, and Etruria, {{the use and}} {{development}} of musical instruments stood {{in stark contrast to}} those cultures' achievements in architecture and sculpture. The instruments of the time were simple and virtually all of them were imported from other cultures. Lyres were the principal instrument, as musicians used them to honor the gods. Greeks played a variety of wind instruments they classified as aulos (reeds) or syrinx (flutes); Greek writing from that time reflects a serious study of reed production and playing technique. Romans played reed instruments named tibia, featuring side-holes that could be opened or closed, allowing for greater <b>flexibility</b> <b>in</b> playing modes. Other instruments in common use in the region included vertical harps derived from those of the Orient, lutes of Egyptian design, various pipes and organs, and clappers, which were played primarily by women.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is {{improving}} individual Private Finance Initiative (PFI) projects to deliver better value {{for the benefit of the}} partners in PFI. Signing long term contracts of 20 to 30 years with the private sector typically enlarges demand risks in PFI. Subsequently, this report seeks a way to deliver more valuable PFI projects by the effective management of demand risks. Incorporation of <b>flexibilities</b> <b>in</b> design is found to be a promising solution to deal with greater demand risks. Flexibility can add a significant value to the project as it allows actively reacting to the unforeseen circumstances in the future.
