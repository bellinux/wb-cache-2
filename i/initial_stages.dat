The training they provided to Nationalist force proved as valuable, if not more so, than direct actions. Approximately 56,000 Nationalist soldiers were trained by various German detachments in Spain, who were technically proficient; these covered infantry, tanks and anti-tank units, air and anti-aircraft forces, and those trained in naval warfare.|$|E

Temporary measures include the administration of calcium to protect against cardiac complications, insulin or salbutamol to redistribute potassium into cells, and infusions of bicarbonate solution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{precipitation}} {{behavior of}} Mg and Si during storage at RT in Al-Mg-Si alloys pre-aged at 90 °C was studied using a tensile test and {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) measurement. Specimens were solutionized at 530 °C, water-quenched and then pre-aged for 2, 6 and 12 hours at 90 °C during which small precipitates were formed. In the pre-aged alloy, the strengthening rate at RT has two <b>stages.</b> In the <b>initial</b> <b>stage,</b> the yield strength increases slowly with the aging time and in the final stage, it increases rapidly. In the <b>initial</b> <b>stage,</b> the strength in the pre-aged alloy is smaller than that in the non pre-aged alloy, while in the final stage, the strength in the pre-aged alloy is larger than that in the non pre-aged alloy. Furthermore, {{the period of the}} <b>initial</b> <b>stage</b> is dependent on the pre-aging period at 90 °C. The DSC curves of alloys in the <b>initial</b> <b>stage</b> do not show the presence of clusters, while those in the final stage do. It seems that in the <b>initial</b> <b>stage</b> Mg and Si atoms accumulate around the small precipitates that have been formed in pre-aging at 90 °C while in the final stage, the clusters of these atoms are formed...|$|R

It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous subcutaneous infusions. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches (lisuride and rotigotine) and are useful for people in the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.|$|E

He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set {{on the left side}} of the instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> until they reached a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{concerning}} {{the scope and}} nature of base development in the Admiralty Islands were held in early February between representatives of SWPA and Admiral William Halsey, Jr.'s neighbouring South Pacific Area (SOPAC). The original intention was forces from SWPA would capture the islands and construct the airbase, while SOPAC {{would be responsible for}} the development of the naval base. The SOPAC representatives indicated they would not be able to supply troops or materials in the early stages, so it was resolved SWPA would also undertake the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> of naval base development.|$|E

However, the percentage preference towards artificial feed increases {{as the days}} of culture/average body weight increases. Consumption of artificial feed was high during evening meal (1700 h) and low during night meal (2200 h). The index of intestine fullness was high (8. 4 ± 0. 7) during <b>initial</b> <b>stage</b> of rearing, {{compared to that of}} final stage of rearing (4. 9 ± 0. 4), probably due to low nutritional value of intake material and low water depth at <b>initial</b> <b>stage.</b> At all stage of rearing omnivorous feeding habit was established and no evidence of diet periodicity in feeding activity was observed...|$|R

After serving in the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> of the Western Desert Campaign, for which he was mentioned in despatches, he led the regiment well during the Battle of Greece.

5|$|However, Australian bowlers such as O'Reilly and Grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump, restricting his scoring as he {{had fewer}} {{effective}} leg-side shots. Occasionally, he displayed discomfort against the fastest bowlers. His team-mate Charlie Barnett {{said that he did}} not relish fast bowling, although he was capable of playing it well in the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> of his career. Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, believed that he did not like to face the new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen to face the difficult bowling.|$|E

Some of the pieces assembled to create the sculptures were made using copper rod, while others were formed using the lost-wax casting technique.

However, nearly all offensives launched by Azerbaijan failed or could not hold on to captured territory. By the spring of 1993 the Azerbaijani military, which had the upper hand in the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> of the war, had been largely reduced to unorganized and incoherent fighting groups. By March 1993 the fighting had shifted to west and south of Karabakh.|$|E
