A grand {{stairway}} is located {{at the end of the}} mansion's central hall, extending from the first floor to the attic. The stairway's handrail is crafted of walnut, and it is connected to the stairway's shallow steps by a balustrade consisting of three small balusters per step.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Palace, {{also known}} as Dar el-Makhzen, is located next to the Badi Palace. The Almohads built the palace in the 12th century {{on the site of}} their kasba, and it was partly remodeled by the Saadians in the 16th century and the Alaouites in the 17th century. Historically {{it was one of the}} palaces owned by the Moroccan king, who {{employed}} some of the most talented craftsmen in the city for its construction. The palace is not open to the public, and is now privately owned by French businessman Dominique du Beldi. The rooms are large, with unusually <b>high</b> <b>ceilings</b> for Marrakesh, with zellij (elaborate geometric terracotta tile work covered with enamel) and cedar painted ceilings.|$|E

25|$|Starting in the 1980s, the {{perfection}} of the extractor hood allowed an open kitchen again, integrated more or less with the living room without causing the whole apartment or house to smell. Before that, only a few earlier experiments, typically in newly built upper-middle-class family homes, had open kitchens. Examples are Frank Lloyd Wright's House Willey (1934) and House Jacobs (1936). Both had open kitchens, with <b>high</b> <b>ceilings</b> (up to the roof) and were aired by skylights. The extractor hood {{made it possible to}} build open kitchens in apartments, too, where both <b>high</b> <b>ceilings</b> and skylights were not possible.|$|E

50|$|<b>High</b> <b>ceiling</b> diuretics {{may cause}} a {{substantial}} diuresis - up to 20% of the filtered load of NaCl (salt) and water. This is large {{in comparison to}} normal renal sodium reabsorption which leaves only about 0.4% of filtered sodium in the urine. Loop diuretics have this ability, and are therefore often synonymous with <b>high</b> <b>ceiling</b> diuretics. Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, inhibit the body's ability to reabsorb sodium at the ascending loop in the nephron, which leads to an excretion {{of water in the}} urine, whereas water normally follows sodium back into the extracellular fluid. Other examples of <b>high</b> <b>ceiling</b> loop diuretics include ethacrynic acid and torsemide.|$|R

30|$|Facilitators built these {{expectations}} through consistent invitations. The timeline (Fig.  8 b) shows that {{almost half of}} facilitator prompts (46 %) occurred in the first 3  months after the workshop. Later prompts served as reminders to keep participation levels high. Facilitators crafted “low floor, high ceiling” prompts that were easy for participants to respond to (low floor) but allowed for more complex discussions (<b>high</b> <b>ceiling).</b> Low floor prompts encouraged participants to check in and describe what they were doing, rather than asking for evaluative reflections that might be more intimidating, especially for participants struggling with IBL. Yet, these simple check-ins often generated rich discussion (<b>high</b> <b>ceiling).</b> The example message just previous is a perfect example: an observation {{about the difference between}} two sections (low floor) started one of the richer discussion threads on the listserv (<b>high</b> <b>ceiling).</b> Thus, persistent prompting and inviting generated many conversations indirectly.|$|R

There are two developments, called English Gables I and II; {{they were meant}} to provide a gateway to the neighborhood for commercial traffic and for passengers from the 82nd Street– Jackson Heights station. A year later, the Robert Morris Apartments, on 37th Avenue between 79th and 80th Streets, were constructed. Named after Robert Morris, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, the apartments have ample green spaces, original <b>high</b> <b>ceilings,</b> and fireplaces, and are relatively expensive.|$|E
25|$|The {{shapes and}} sizes of houses differ from state to state. Common {{elements}} in Peninsular Malaysia include pitched roofs, verandahs, and <b>high</b> <b>ceilings,</b> raised on stilts for ventilation. The woodwork {{in the house is}} often intricately carved. The floors are at different levels depending on the function of the room. Mosques have traditionally been based on Javanese architecture. In modern times, the government has promoted different projects, from the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Twin Towers, to a whole garden city, Putrajaya. Malaysian firms are developing skyscraper designs that are specifically for tropical climates.|$|E
25|$|Glasgow {{is known}} for its tenements – the red and blond {{sandstone}} buildings {{are some of the most}} recognisable features of the city. These were the most popular form of housing in 19th- and 20th-century Glasgow and remain the most common form of dwelling in Glasgow today. Tenements are commonly bought by a wide range of social types and are favoured for their large rooms, <b>high</b> <b>ceilings</b> and original period features. The Hyndland area of Glasgow is the only tenement conservation area in the UK and includes some tenement houses with as many as six bedrooms.|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} the {{buildings}} with a high clearance between {{the floor and the}} ceiling such as airport terminals, shopping malls, atria, movie studios, theaters, convention halls, and hotel lobbies has been steadily increasing in recent years. These structures pose a unique challenge to fire safety engineers and building code officials alike because of their high clearances between the floor and the ceiling. One of the most practical yet most reliable protection schemes is installing automatic fire sprinklers on the ceiling. Two critical issues regarding the sprinkler operation at <b>high</b> <b>ceiling</b> clearance facilities are: (1) whether the sprinklers installed on such a <b>high</b> <b>ceiling</b> would operate when there is fire, and (2) what are the proper sprinkler parameters that would effectively control fire once the system activates? Utilizing the test data collected through a number of fire tests in a <b>high</b> <b>ceiling</b> clearance facility, this paper will discuss the two issues...|$|R

25|$|The {{courtyard}} doughnut {{shape is}} critical to the two main design priorities: daylighting and natural ventilation. Natural daylighting was achieved through the shallow floor plate depths and <b>high</b> <b>ceilings</b> allowing for light to penetrate the interior of the offices from both the exterior of the building and the core open-air courtyard. Daylighting models were tested at the University of Washington’s Integrated Design Lab to ensure even lighting and minimizing glare to users working on computers. Within the bulk of the building, daylight sensors are on all lighting within 15 feet of the windows and Energy Star equipment is provided to reduce the plug load.|$|E
25|$|During hibernation, Indiana bats occupy open {{areas of}} hibernacula {{ceilings}} and generally avoid crevices and other enclosed areas. Indiana bats {{were associated with}} hibernacula that were long (µ=2,817 feet (858 m)), had <b>high</b> <b>ceilings</b> (µ=15 feet (4.5 m)), and had large entrances (µ=104.4 feet² (9.7 m²)). The preferred hibernacula often had multiple entrances promoting airflow. Hibernacula choice {{may be influenced by}} the ability of the outside landscape to provide adequate forage upon arrival at the hibernacula as well as the specific microclimate inside. Having forested areas around the hibernacula entrance and low amounts of open farmland may be important factors influencing the suitability of hibernacula.|$|E
25|$|Heymann {{says most}} of the rooms are {{relatively}} small and have <b>high</b> <b>ceilings.</b> The living-family room and the kitchen-dining room in the east end of the house are large, laid out for frequent entertaining and family gatherings. The living room has a series of glass picture doors. The tin roof of the house extends beyond the porch. When it rains, it’s possible to sit on the patio and watch the water pour down without getting wet. Under a gravel border around the house, a concrete gutter channels the water into the cistern for irrigation. In hot weather, a terrace directly above the cistern is a little cooler than the surrounding area.|$|E
