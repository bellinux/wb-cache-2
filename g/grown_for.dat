5|$|When {{they were}} first cultivated, carrots were <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> their {{aromatic}} leaves and seeds rather than their roots. Carrot seeds {{have been found in}} Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000–3000 BC. Some close relatives of the carrot are still <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, coriander, fennel, anise, dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century; the Romans ate a root vegetable called pastinaca, which may have been either the carrot or the closely related parsnip.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the {{horticulture}} industry focussed on registered selections of Banksia spinulosa, {{but since the}} late 1990s more and more cultivars of Banksia ericifolia have come on the market, including colour variants and dwarf forms. The latter are particularly attractive as the original plant may reach 6metres in height, and the new cultivars help enthusiasts choose a plant that is right for their conditions and tastes. Banksia ericifolia is also <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> the cut flower industry in Australia, though not {{to the degree that}} the western Australian species such as B.coccinea and B.menziesii are.|$|E
5|$|Four {{subspecies}} of cowpea are recognised, {{of which}} three are cultivated. There {{is a high}} level of morphological diversity found within the species with large variations in the size, shape and structure of the plant. Cowpeas can be erect, semi erect (trailing) or climbing. The crop is mainly <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> its seeds, which are extremely high in protein, although the leaves and immature seed pods can also be consumed.|$|E
25|$|Fruit was an {{important}} source of food for the Israelites, particularly grapes, olives and figs. Grapes were <b>grown</b> mostly <b>for</b> wine, although some were eaten fresh at harvest time, or dried as raisins for storage while olives were <b>grown</b> exclusively <b>for</b> their oil, until the Roman period. Other fruits that were eaten were the date, pomegranate and sycamore fig.|$|R

5|$|High-quality fruits {{come from}} the Loire Valley and central France, {{including}} cherries <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> the liqueur Guignolet and the 'Belle Angevine' pears. The strawberries and melons are also of high quality. Fish are seen in the cuisine, often served with a beurre blanc sauce, as well as wild game, lamb, calves, Charolais cattle, Géline fowl, and high-quality goat cheeses. Young vegetables are used often in the cuisine, as are the specialty mushrooms of the region, champignons de Paris. Vinegars from Orléans are a specialty ingredient used as well.|$|E
5|$|The family evolved {{approximately}} 52 {{million years}} ago during the Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene eras. Liliaceae are widely distributed, mainly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and the flowers are insect pollinated. Many Liliaceae are important ornamental plants, widely <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> their attractive flowers and involved in a major floriculture of cut flowers and dry bulbs. Some species are poisonous if eaten and can have adverse health effects in humans and household pets.|$|E
5|$|The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) is an {{edible root}} {{vegetable}} of the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times. Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable. They have numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color, {{and length of}} time they take to mature. Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months. Another use of radish is as cover or catch crop in winter or as a forage crop. Some radishes are <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> their seeds; daikon, for instance, may be <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> oil production. Others are used for sprouting.|$|E

5|$|The {{tree onion}} or Egyptian onion {{produces}} bulblets in the umbel instead of flowers, {{and is now}} {{known to be a}} hybrid of A. cepa × A. fistulosum. It has previously been treated as a variety of A. cepa, for example A. cepa var. proliferum, A. cepa var. bulbiferum, and A. cepa var. viviparum. It has been <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> centuries in Japan and China for use as a salad onion.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{create a}} visual {{impact in the}} same way as do other {{landscape}} features and give a sense of maturity and permanence to park and garden. They are <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> the beauty of their forms, their foliage, flowers, fruit and bark and their siting is of major importance in creating a landscape. They can be grouped informally, often surrounded by plantings of bulbs, laid out in stately avenues or used as specimen trees. As living things, their appearance changes with the season and from year to year.|$|E
5|$|Authentic {{gardens of}} the yeoman cottager would have {{included}} a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, {{along with a}} well. The peasant cottager of medieval times {{was more interested in}} meat than flowers, with herbs <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty.|$|E

5|$|By the 1830s the British Agricultural Revolution had {{disturbed}} traditional {{society and}} created a class of labourers who struggled to support their families in rural areas. This led to an unrest known as the Swing riots which swept across southern England, consequently reaching Selborne and Liphook in September 1830. The Parliamentary Enclosure Acts of 1856 established a new land pattern for nearby Steep Marsh and Stroud, which still exists today. There was also extensive land drainage between 1860 and 1880; conduits and sluices were constructed to take water from Ashford Stream for the artificial flooding of hay meadows. In Steep, hops were <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> use in local breweries, watercress produced for commercial use, and a condensed milk factory was in operation in Steep Marsh.|$|E
5|$|Grapes {{are mostly}} <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> making wine and vinegar as basic {{components}} of the Mediterranean diet, as well for drying as raisins or for eating as table grapes. Raisins and table grape varieties are chosen for their flavour. Grape production remains important in the Mediterranean area, with Southern Europe accounting for 21% of the world's harvest. In 2014, Italy produced 6.9 million tonnes (mt) of grapes, Spain 6.2 mt, France 6.2 mt, Turkey 4.2 mt, and Germany 1.2 mt. Wine production for Southern Europe was 37% of the world total in 2014, with Italy producing 4.8 mt, Spain 4.6 mt, France 4.3 mt, and Germany 0.9 mt.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are {{offspring}} {{resulting from}} the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually {{will result in a}} high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> economic purposes. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).|$|E
