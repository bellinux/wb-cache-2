5|$|A {{species of}} sphenodontine is {{known from the}} Miocene Saint Bathans Fauna. Whether it is refereable to Sphenodon proper is not entirely clear, but <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> closely related to tuataras.|$|E
5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-4b's {{discovery}} was announced on January 4, 2010. It {{is the size}} of planet Neptune, at 0.077 MJ (7% the mass of Jupiter) and 0.357 RJ (36% the radius of Jupiter). The planet orbits its star every 3.214 days at 0.045 AU from the star. This distance compares to planet Mercury, which is 0.39 AU from the Sun. Kepler-4's eccentricity was assumed to be 0, however a subsequent independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12. Likewise, the temperature of the planet <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 1650 K, far hotter than Jupiter's, which <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 124 K (not considering its internal heat and atmosphere).|$|E

Rachel is pregnant with their child who <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a girl.|$|E
5|$|Thirdly, the teleological {{explanation}} of adaptation is uncomfortable {{because it seems}} to require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; {{because it seems to}} attribute the action of a conscious mind when none <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present in an organism; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test empirically.|$|E
5|$|When {{the glass}} {{electrode}} cannot be employed, as with non-aqueous solutions, spectrophotometric methods are frequently used. These may involve absorbance or fluorescence measurements. In {{both cases the}} measured quantity <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> proportional to the sum of contributions from each photo-active species; with absorbance measurements the Beer-Lambert law is assumed to apply.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{outcomes}} (dependent variables) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> predicted <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> random variables, the explanatory variables themselves <b>are</b> usually not <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> random. Instead, they <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fixed values, and any random variables (e.g. {{the outcomes}}) <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> conditional on them. As a result, the model user <b>is</b> free <b>to</b> transform the explanatory variables in arbitrary ways, including creating multiple {{copies of a}} given explanatory variable, each transformed using a different function. Other common techniques <b>are</b> <b>to</b> create new explanatory variables {{in the form of}} interaction variables by taking products of two (or sometimes more) existing explanatory variables.|$|R

5|$|After the meal, Starling {{tries to}} attack Lecter, but he overpowers her. She {{handcuffs}} his wrist to hers. Hearing the police closing in, Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape. Lecter is later {{seen on a}} flight with his own boxed lunch, his arm in a sling. As he prepares to eat his meal, including what <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of a cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Initially reluctant, Lecter then assents.|$|E
5|$|Heine's prose {{passage in}} De l'Allemagne tells of supernatural young women called the Wilis. They have died before their wedding day and rise from their graves {{in the middle}} of the night to dance. Any young man who crosses their path is forced to dance to his death. In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted young women who have died and become vampires. This <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the reason that they hate men.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the arrival of}} an arterial bubble in a de-saturating neurological tissue. The bubble exchanges gas with the surrounding tissue and the blood. If the bubble does not exceed a critical radius, it will eventually leave the site without growing, otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia. The critical parameter is bubble radius. This criterion is used to prevent type II neurological symptoms. The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at this stage is to balance gas exchange.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies {{whether the}} central bank should adjust its {{inflation}} target {{to account for the}} systematic upward bias in measured inflation due to quality improvements in consumption goods. We show that {{the answer to this question}} depends on what prices <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sticky. If nonquality-adjusted prices <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sticky, then the inflation target should not be corrected. If, on the other hand, quality-adjusted (or hedonic) prices <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sticky, then the inflation target should be raised by the magnitude of the bias.

5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the presence of}} a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E
5|$|Note that labour <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a 'bad', i.e., a {{commodity}} that a consumer doesn't like. Its presence in his consumption basket lowers the utility he derives. On the other hand, coconuts are goods. This {{is why the}} indifference curves are positively sloped. The maximum amount of labour is indicated by L'. The distance from L' to the chosen supply of labour (L*) gives Crusoe's demand for leisure.|$|E
5|$|The African species' {{breeding}} habitat {{consists of}} forested rivers with islands with sandy shores for breeding. The nesting {{grounds of the}} white-eyed river martin are unknown, but if the breeding habitat resembles that of its relative, {{it is likely to}} be the forested valleys of large rivers, which can provide sandbars and islands for nesting, and woodland over which the birds can catch insect prey. The African river martin uses coastal savannah as its winter habitat. Based on its only known wintering site, the non-breeding habitat of the white-eyed <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the vicinity of open fresh water for feeding, with reed-beds for the night-time roost.|$|E

5|$|As Remy watches {{through the}} window, {{a young man}} named Alfredo Linguini is hired as a garbage boy by Skinner, the restaurant's {{paranoid}} current owner and Gusteau's former sous-chef. When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy but hides him when he is then confronted by Skinner for tampering with the soup. As the two argue, the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. The Chefs convince Skinner to retain Linguini, who <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the soup's creator. When Skinner catches Remy trying to escape, he orders Linguini to kill the rat, but Linguini discovers Remy's intelligence and decides to keep him instead.|$|E
5|$|Days before Halloween, a man explodes a {{truck in}} Mars' capital city, {{spreading}} what <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a new pathogen that kills or sickens over three hundred people. In response, the Mars government issues a record bounty of 300 million woolong for the culprit's capture. Faye, who was pursuing Lee Sampson, a hacker that was apparently driving the truck, sees the terrorist and the Bebop crew {{decide to take}} on the bounty. Each follows different lines of inquiry. Ed, using a tattoo on the attacker's wrist, manages to identify him as Vincent Volaju, a former member of a military squad apparently killed in the Titan War. In reality, Vincent was the only survivor of a test involving the pathogen, having been immunized with a test vaccine: made an amnesic, he suffers from hallucinations, and his inability to tell dreams from reality eventually drove him insane.|$|E
