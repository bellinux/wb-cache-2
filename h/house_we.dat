25|$|The {{efforts of}} the male members of the Tagore family {{in the field of}} music, theatre and writing must have {{penetrated}} into the inner precincts of the Jorasanko Thakur Bari and touched a chord in Swarnakumari. When Jyotirindranath Tagore was involved with his experiments in music, plays and writing, he was assisted by Akshay Chandra Chaudhuri and Rabindranath. In his Jyotirindrasmriti (Reminiscence) he wrote, “With Janaki going to England and arrival of my younger sister Swarnakumari in our <b>house,</b> <b>we</b> got another partner in our literary ventures.” While Gyanadanandini Devi took the lead for breaking down age-old restrictions on women in the house, Swarnakumari flourished in creativity.|$|E
25|$|Frith formed Keep the Dog in 1989, a sextet {{and review}} band for {{performing}} selections of his extensive repertoire of compositions {{from the previous}} 15 years. The lineup was Frith (guitar, violin, bass guitar), René Lussier (guitar, bass guitar), Jean Derome (winds), Zeena Parkins (piano, synthesizer, harp, accordion), Bob Ostertag (sampling keyboard), and Kevin Norton (drums, percussion). Later Charles Hayward replaced Norton on drums. The group existed until mid-1991, performing live in Europe, North America and the former Soviet Union. A double CD, That <b>House</b> <b>We</b> Lived In, from their final performances in Austria, Germany and Italy in May and June 1991, was released in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Inigo Jones {{had brought}} the {{classical}} renaissance style to England in the early 17th century. His followers took the new classical style into the country, characterised by its symmetry and proportion and such classical elements as pilasters, while wide eaves took {{the place of a}} cornice. Often a bricklayer would also be the principal contractor, controlling the other trades, and he could avoid the necessity to employ a mason for stonework if he could produce the classical elements in brick. So in this <b>house</b> <b>we</b> have brick pilasters, one above the other, with capitals and bases shaped in brickwork. The rebuilding seems to have been carried out in two stages, though without a long gap between them. There is a straight joint in the brickwork {{to the left of the}} second pilaster on the north side. In front of this the bricks are laid in English bond, but Flemish bond is used towards the back, indicating that this part was built a little later.|$|E

[...] {{at the beginning of}} Halpern's section on [...] "Mechanical Plots". Halpern describes Lisa's efforts to build a perpetual-motion machine while bored during the teachers strike, and comments that though it is absurd in reality to order someone to obey the laws of thermodynamics, he acknowledges that [...] "physicists sometimes don't know the proper arena within which certain laws apply". In the July 26, 2007 issue of Nature, the scientific journal's editorial staff listed [...] "The PTA Disbands" [...] among [...] "The Top Ten science moments in The Simpsons", writing: [...] "Lisa gets so bored by a lack of schooling she builds a perpetual motion machine. Homer is not pleased: 'Lisa, in this <b>house</b> <b>we</b> OBEY the laws of thermodynamics.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and American record {{producer}} Jude Cole. It was recorded and produced by John Alagía at his home studio in Easton, Maryland. In an interview with MTV, Wade explained his experience working with Alagía, and said, [...] "When we walked into John's <b>house,</b> <b>we</b> didn't know what to expect, and we {{get in there and}} the mixing board is in the living room, the B3 [...] is in the kitchen and the piano is over there. And he's so nonchalant about all his stuff — there'd be a triple-platinum Dave Matthews Band plaque sticking out from under the bed." [...] "You and Me" [...] was first released via digital download on January 28, 2005. It was then solicited to mainstream radio on March 15, 2005. An extended wedding version of the song was released on July 26, 2005.|$|E

500|$|In April 1844, Verdi took on Emanuele Muzio, {{eight years}} his junior, as a pupil and amanuensis. He {{had known him}} since about 1828 as another of Barezzi's protégés. Muzio, who in fact was Verdi's only pupil, became {{indispensable}} to the composer. He reported to Barezzi that Verdi [...] "has a breadth of spirit, of generosity, a wisdom." [...] In November 1846, Muzio wrote of Verdi: [...] "If you could see us, I seem more like a friend, rather than his pupil. We are always together at dinner, in the cafes, when we play cards...; all in all, he doesn't go anywhere without me at his side; in the <b>house</b> <b>we</b> have a big table and we both write there together, and so I always have his advice." [...] Muzio was to remain associated with Verdi, assisting {{in the preparation of}} scores and transcriptions, and later conducting many of his works in their premiere performances in the US and elsewhere outside Italy. He was chosen by Verdi as one of the executors of his will, but predeceased the composer in 1890.|$|E
500|$|Musically, Black Eye was {{described}} by Carrie Borzillo of Billboard as [...] "pure hardcore punk delivered with a raunchy, abrasive vocal assault from [...]" [...] Aaron Axelsen, music director at modern rock KITS, opined that the band is [...] "a real indie, edgy version of Elastica, but not Britpop. They fit into that Hole, L7, Tuscadero, Veruca Salt, edgy thing." [...] The band, however, felt [...] "insulted" [...] when journalists compared them to Elastica because they think the sound of Elastica is too [...] "clean". As Rootes recalls, [...] "I admit every time me and Bridged cleaned our <b>house</b> <b>we</b> put Elastica on". Despite this, she considers Elastica, along with the Sex Pistols and the Buzzcocks, as the only UK bands among her favorites. The band cited the Sex Pistols, the New York Dolls, and The Stooges as their musical influences. They also preferred the Sex Pistols over the Clash. According to Rootes, [...] "The Sex Pistols are political in a great teenage fuck-you way. The Clash are political in a mature way, like they've done politics in A-levels." ...|$|E

Its lead-off single [...] "Proud of the <b>House</b> <b>We</b> Built" [...] reached number 4 on the country charts and 57 on the Hot 100. Following this song were [...] "God Must Be Busy" [...] at number 11 and [...] "Put a Girl in It" [...] at number 3. After this song, the duo released [...] "Cowgirls Don't Cry", which they later performed with Reba McEntire at the Country Music Association awards. Following this performance, the song was re-released partway through its chart run with McEntire dubbed into the final chorus. In early 2009, the song peaked at number two on the country charts. Although not released as a single, the title track spent three weeks on the charts and peaked at number 56. Also included on the album is a collaboration with Jerry Jeff Walker on [...] "The Ballad of Jerry Jeff Walker". Cowboy Town was also {{the name of the}} duo's 2009 tour, which featured Rodney Atkins and ZZ Top. The tour began on June 6 at the BamaJam festival in Enterprise, Alabama.|$|E
500|$|Leaving Levene in {{the late}} 1980s to become a {{freelance}} stylist in television advertising, MTV and film, Everest began styling bands and pop stars such as George Michael. He recognised a shift in perception of the male fashion industry; men had become more label conscious. This had coincided with the increased awareness of top-end fashion designers, like Hugo Boss and Armani, highlighted by men's lifestyle magazines; such as Arena and The Face. He said, [...] "I thought {{that if we could}} demystify bespoke tailoring and make it more accessible, as well as really understanding {{what was going on in}} ready-to-wear fashion and being directional with it, there was possibly a market there." [...] Having decided to create the Timothy Everest brand as an alternative to 'designer' ready-to-wear, he searched for a suitable location away from [...] "the stuffiness of Savile Row". Everest opened his first premises in 1989; in Princelet Street, Spitalfields, just outside the City of London, in the East End. He said, [...] "We started in one room of a <b>house.</b> <b>We</b> had one rail with four garments on and a telephone, no chairs, no furniture." [...] To begin with, business was slow. Moving premises in 1993, he chose a three-storey, early Georgian townhouse (built in 1724), just north of Old Spitalfields Market in nearby Elder Street – the former home of artist Mark Gertler (1891–1939) – converting it to an atelier over seven weeks. He dressed Tom Cruise for the 1996 film [...] Cruise liked the suits so much that he kept them, and commissioned Everest to make him some more.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{expectations}} of capital appreciation in the <b>housing</b> market. <b>We</b> show that expectations impounded in the rent/price ratio {{at the beginning}} of the decade successfully predict appreciation rates, but only if we first control for cross-sectional differences in the quality of rental versus owner-occupied <b>housing.</b> <b>We</b> also demonstrate that observed rent/price ratios contain a disequilibrium component that also has power to forecast subsequent appreciation rates. Finally, we provide evidence consistent with euphoria: participants in housing markets appear to overreact to income growth. ...|$|R
