50|$|Chain-drive {{systems such}} as the {{derailleur}} systems work best if the chain is aligned with the sprocket plane, especially avoiding the biggest drive sprocket running with the biggest <b>driven</b> <b>sprocket</b> (or the smallest with the smallest). The diagonal chain run produced by these practices is less efficient and shortens the life of all components, with no advantage {{from the middle of}} the range ratio obtained.|$|E
50|$|Chain drive uses {{sprockets}} and {{a roller}} chain, which requires both lubrication and adjustment for elongation (stretch) that occurs through wear. The lubricant {{is subject to}} being thrown off the fast-moving chain and results in grime and dirt build up. Chains do deteriorate, and excessive wear {{on the front and}} rear sprockets can be dangerous. In a chain drive the power is transmitted into the real wheel via a cush drive. Conventional roller chain drives suffer the potential for vibration, as the effective radius of action in a chain and sprocket combination constantly changes during revolution ("chordal action"). If a drive sprocket rotates at constant RPM, then the chain (and the <b>driven</b> <b>sprocket)</b> must accelerate and decelerate constantly. Most chain-driven motorcycles are fitted with a rubber bushed rear wheel hub to eliminate this vibration issue.|$|E
40|$|In a chain canveyor system, {{tensile force}} and chain slack have a {{significant}} effect on a material's vibration and transferring efficiency. Therefore it becomes an important problem for the chain conveyor to control tensile force and chain slack, Nowadays, most chain conveyor drive sprockets are driven by a motor, and the <b>driven</b> <b>sprocket</b> is controlled by a brake to give a moderate tensile force. However, it is difficult to adequately control the tensile force, because the brake has a tendency to influence the torque and revolution of the driving motor. We then developed a new driving system which has two motors; one is the main motor for conveying materials and the other is an auxiliary motor which is used to control tensile force and chain slack without influencing torque and revolution of the main motor. In this report, we describe the performance of this system...|$|E

5000|$|A {{tracked vehicle}} uses a {{combination}} of wheels and rollers, including <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets,</b> idler wheels, track return rollers and road wheels. It is quite similar in concept to a conveyor belt, only instead of a machine carrying objects {{on top of a}} powered continuous belt, it's a machine that moves itself over a continuous belt. In a typical application, power is transmitted to a <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> (or <b>drive</b> wheel), which drives the track around its loop. On {{the opposite end of the}} vehicle, there is an idler wheel, which provides a pulley wheel of sorts. On some applications, the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and idler wheel carry some of the weight of the vehicle, for the purposes of this description, we will assume the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and idler wheel are not weight-bearing units, and the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> is on the front (see M4 Sherman for an example). Since the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> can be at either the front (M4 Sherman) or the rear (M1 Abrahms) of the vehicle depending on the design, the idler wheel either carries the track back off the ground and returns it to the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> (rear idler wheel), or receives track from the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and lays it down in front of the road wheels (front idler wheel). The idler wheel is not powered, just like an idler gear. Although it technically reverses the tracks direction (but not its rotation), this has nothing to do with the term [...] "idler"; it is not related to an idler gear other than that they are both [...] "idle", or not doing any work, only transmitting power ("idle" [...] being a term for something or someone who isn't working). The road wheels are a series of non-powered wheels between the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and idler wheel that serve to support the weight of the vehicle (and thus aren't considered [...] "idle", even though they are unpowered). In higher speed applications, such as tanks and other AFV's, these road wheels are typically given some sort of suspension system to ease the ride, increase controllability, and decrease wear and tear. Due to the complications in adding suspension systems to the idler wheel and, in particular, the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket,</b> in such vehicles, the road wheels typically carry all of the weight of the vehicle. In low speed applications, such as bulldozers, these road wheels lack any kind of suspension system, as the low speeds don't demand the cushioning. This also allows the idler and drive wheels to carry some of the weight, as their lack of suspension is made irrelevant. Track return rollers may or may not be used, and are simply small rollers which support the weight of the track as it's transferred from rear to front to be laid down again.The track simply provides a solid [...] "road" [...] for the road wheels to roll over on over all surfaces: the road wheels roll the vehicle along the self-created [...] "road", while the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> forces the vehicle forward along the track and lays down [...] "fresh" [...] track. The idler picks the [...] "used" [...] track back up, and returns it back to the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> in the front. This is why an early term for a tracked vehicle was a [...] "track-laying machine" [...] (not to be confused with railroad track laying equipment). Transporting vehicles over muddy ground often required planks or logs to be placed along the track (see corduroy road, plank road). In the later 19th century, inventors figured out a way to make a rolling machine that would lay its own plank road wherever it went, negating the need for farmers to lay down logs in order to traverse muddy areas. Other benefits were discovered later.|$|R
50|$|Among modern tractors, {{the high}} <b>drive</b> (elevated <b>sprocket)</b> design {{is unique to}} Caterpillar products. The concept {{originated}} in 1914 with Caterpillar predecessor C. L. Best Tractor's 30 Humpback; this tractor was discontinued a year later, and the only other tractor to use the concept until the D10's introduction was the Cletrac Model F, built between 1920 and 1922. The elevated sprocket eliminates the final drive system, inclined to frequent failure. This elevated <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> undercarriage was built in modular form; breakdown of the tracks and removal of the <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> was much easier. The transmission can {{be removed from the}} rear because of the modular design. As the engine and drivetrain are mounted high in a traditional bulldozer, the half shafts from the differential exit above the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket,</b> requiring a small gear {{on the end of the}} half shaft and another, larger one attached to the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket.</b> The high-drive system eliminates the traditional final drive in favor of the planetary final drive, which withstands engine torque better, since it distributes the forces over multiple gear teeth instead of a single tooth as in the traditional system. The disadvantage is that the track moves around one more sprocket, reducing track life. Caterpillar claims to have alleviated this with the SALT (Sealed and Lubricated Track), a permanently lubricated track system which was introduced on their track-type tractors in the early 1970s.|$|R

50|$|StuG III Ausf. B: (Sd.Kfz 142; June 1940May 1941, 300 {{produced}} by Alkett) Widened tracks (380 mm). Two Rubber tires on each roadwheel were accordingly widened from 520 × 79 mm to 520 × 95 mm each. Both types of roadwheel were interchangeable. The troublesome 10-speed transmission {{was changed to}} a 6-speed one. The forwardmost return rollers were re-positioned further forward, reducing the vertical movements of the tracks before they were fed to the forward <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket,</b> and so reduced the chance of tracks being thrown. In the middle of production of the Ausf. B model, the original <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> with eight round holes was changed to a new cast <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> with six pie slice-shaped slots. This new drive wheel could take either 380 mm tracks or 400 mm wide tracks. 380 mm tracks were not exclusive to new drive wheels. Vehicle number 90111 shows the older drive wheel with wider 380 mm tracks.|$|R
50|$|BM Oplot is {{equipped}} with torsion bar type suspension. Either side of the six dual rubber-tyred road wheels are provided with idler at forward, <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> at the rear, and track support rollers.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that there}} are some non-powered tracked {{transports}} (i.e. trailers that roll on tracks rather than wheels), which have two idler wheels rather than a <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket.</b> There are also certain pieces of equipment, such as the Caterpillar D9 bulldozer, Tucker Sno-cat and Mattracks rubber track conversion kits, which configure their tracks {{in the shape of a}} triangle, or pyramid (when viewed from the side), with the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> at the tip of the pyramid. In this configuration, there are two idler/roadwheels and one <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> (as well as a number of small, load-bearing roadwheels). In very rare cases, the vehicle lacks an idler wheel at all; in Northern regions, one way people got better traction in deep snow was to take a simple three-axle truck, and install a simple continuous track around the rear wheels, thus forming a basic half-track system which featured two drive wheels, and no idler or road wheels. One almost never sees this on true tracked vehicles, however, as the second drive wheel is redundant.|$|R
5000|$|The Caterpillar D10 is a track-type tractor {{manufactured}} by Caterpillar Inc. (then called the Caterpillar Tractor Company). It {{was the first}} modern tractor to use the elevated <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> to improve durability, operator comfort, and ease of maintenance.|$|R

50|$|The tractor's most {{distinctive}} feature was its running gear. Four full height roadwheels acted as roadwheels, rear <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket,</b> front idler and track return rollers.

5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} pivot (like the Hesketh V1000) was co-axial with the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> to maintain constant chain tension. This feature meant that (i) a smaller drive chain {{could be used}} and/or (ii) the chain was less stressed and therefore less likely to break.|$|R

50|$|The hull {{is made of}} {{welded steel}} plates and ensures {{protection}} against bullet caliber 7.62 mm and artillery splinters. The suspension is torsion bar. Road wheels (six from each <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket)</b> have holes to reduce weight. MLVM is fully amphibious, being propelled with a maximum speed of 5-6 km/h in water. Prior to the crossing of rivers or lakes (although the MLVM is amphibious, it is not designed for marine infantry use), a trim vane must be erected at the front and bilge pumps turned on, taking no more than 5 minutes. Suspension is torsion bar type with six rubber-tyred spoked road wheels either side, <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> at the front, idler at the rear and track-return rollers. Some vehicles have been observed with five - not six - road wheels.|$|R
5000|$|Tracks may be broadly {{categorized}} as [...] "live" [...] or [...] "dead" [...] track. [...] "Dead" [...] track {{is a simple}} design in which each track plate {{is connected to the}} rest with hinge-type pins. These dead tracks will lie flat if placed on the ground; the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> pulls the track around the wheels with no assistance from the track itself. [...] "Live" [...] track is slightly more complex, with each link connected to the next by a bushing which causes the track to bend slightly inward. A length of live track left on the ground will curl upward slightly at each end. Although the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> must still pull the track around the wheels, the track itself tends to bend inward, slightly assisting the sprocket and somewhat conforming to the wheels.|$|R
50|$|As part of {{the rapid}} {{development}} program, the Loyd used parts from other vehicles: From the Universal Carrier, the track, <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets,</b> and Horstmann suspension units; from the Fordson 7V, the chassis, engine, gearbox, torque tube and front axle.
