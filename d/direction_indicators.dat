25|$|Usage of {{emergency}} vehicle lighting is restricted in the United Kingdom through the Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989. It is illegal for any vehicle {{to show a}} flashing colored light (with {{the exception of the}} normal <b>direction</b> <b>indicators</b> or a green anti-lock brake warning indicator), unless it is an emergency or other authorized vehicle. However recently pedal cycles can exhibit a flashing rear red lamp and flashing white front lamp.|$|E
25|$|Two basic {{models were}} built: 410 (1964–1965) with a {{combination}} rear lamp set consisting of round and rectangular lenses, and 411 (1965–1967), which featured the same combination rear lamp set as the earlier 410 through 1966, changing to higher mounted rectangular tail light sets for 1967. On both, the rear <b>direction</b> <b>indicators</b> were red or amber, according to market – New Zealand, which allows either, took the 410 with both and the 411 with red only. This Bluebird {{was one of the}} first Japanese car lines assembled in New Zealand, initially imported under a tariff/duty arrangement allowing 300 cars a year (the so-called '300 Club') with CKD kits built up by Motor Holdings at Mount Wellington in Auckland. The 410 series sedan and station wagon plus a light delivery van was assembled in South Africa at a factory in Rosslyn Pretoria. These cars were all in CKD format.|$|E

25|$|The list {{of items}} tested has been {{continually}} expanded over the years, including in 1968 – a tyre check; 1977 – checks of windscreen wipers and washers, <b>direction</b> <b>indicators,</b> brakelights, horns, exhaust system and condition of the body structure and chassis; 1991 – checks of the emissions test for petrol engine vehicles, together with checks on the anti-lock braking system, rear wheel bearings, rear wheel steering (where appropriate) and rear seat belts; 1992 – a stricter tyre tread depth requirement for most vehicles; 1994 – a check of emissions for diesel engine vehicles; 2005 – introduction of a computerised administration system for issuing non-secure test certificates. Also rolled out in 2005 {{was the creation of}} the 'Automated Test Bay' this differs from traditional testing by adding additional equipment to the bay to negate the use of an assistant during the test; 2012 – checks of secondary restraint systems, battery and wiring, ESC, speedometers and steering locks.|$|E

2500|$|The railway {{uses the}} Radio Control Train Order {{signalling}} system. Outside Ravenglass station, {{the line is}} single track with passing loops at Miteside, Irton Road and Fisherground. Trains operate by radio communication between drivers and at Ravenglass signal box. At passing loops and the terminus station, drivers contact the controller, using [...] "RANDER" [...] reporting numbers (even numbers for up trains, and odd for down), {{to indicate that the}} train is within the loop and is clear of the preceding single track. To leave the loop, the driver contacts control to gain authorisation to enter the next single track section. No semaphore signals are used outside Ravenglass station. Points at passing loops are weighted with <b>direction</b> <b>indicators,</b> meaning that no human intervention is required and the points reset themselves automatically after the passage of a train when entering the points from a trailing direction when the points are set for the other rail line.|$|E

25|$|Early examples, {{and most}} {{used by the}} Navy, had an output that {{directly}} drove a Pilot <b>Direction</b> <b>Indicator</b> meter in the cockpit. This eliminated the need to manually signal the pilot, as well as eliminating the possibility of error.|$|R

50|$|More modern {{aviation}} ADFs {{contain a}} small array of fixed aerials and use electronic sensors to deduce the direction using {{the strength and}} phase of the signals from each aerial. The electronic sensors listen for the trough that occurs when the antenna is {{at right angles to}} the signal, and provide the heading to the station using a <b>direction</b> <b>indicator.</b> In flight, the ADF's RMI or <b>direction</b> <b>indicator</b> will always point to the broadcast station regardless of aircraft heading, however a banked attitude can have a slight effect on the reading, the needle will still generally indicate towards the beacon, however it suffers from DIP error where the needle dips down {{in the direction of the}} turn.|$|R

50|$|A pilot <b>direction</b> <b>indicator,</b> or PDI, is an {{aircraft}} instrument used by bombardiers to indicate heading {{changes to the}} pilot in order to direct them to the proper location to drop bombs.
