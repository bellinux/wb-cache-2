The latter press also published the collections Shooting an Elephant and Other <b>Essays</b> in 1950 (republished by Penguin in 2003) and England Your England and Other <b>Essays</b> in 1953.|$|E

5|$|The authorship of seventy-three of The Federalist <b>essays</b> {{is fairly}} certain.

The first open designation of which essay belonged to whom was provided by Hamilton, who {{in the days before}} his ultimately fatal gun duel with Aaron Burr provided his lawyer with a list detailing the author of each number. This list credited Hamilton with a full sixty-three of the <b>essays</b> (three of those being jointly written with Madison), almost three-quarters of the whole, and was used as the basis for an 1810 printing that was the first to make specific attribution for the <b>essays.</b>|$|E
