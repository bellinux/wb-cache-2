40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the short-term effect of cinnamon on blood pressure in middle-aged obese adults. Subjects consumed a beverage with (experimental) and without (control) 6 g <b>ground</b> cassia <b>cinnamon.</b> Blood pressure was assessed at baseline, and then at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes. A food frequency questionnaire was administered to estimate usual dietary intake. Twenty-six adults (9 males and 17 females), aged 40 - 65 years, completed the study. There was no significant difference in blood pressure at any time point between the two conditions (p> 0. 05). Multiple regression analysis evaluated the relationship between usual intake of diet components and control baseline blood pressure. The diet components studied did not significantly predict systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure at baseline. The results of this study suggest 6 g cinnamon does not exert a short-term beneficial effect on blood pressure in middle-aged obese adults. Department of Family and Consumer SciencesThesis (M.

25|$|Dishes {{that were}} {{intended}} to be eaten as well as entertain {{can be traced back}} at least to the early Roman Empire. In his Satyricon, the Roman writer Petronius describes a dish consisting of a rabbit dressed to look like the mythical horse Pegasus. The function of the entremet was to mark the end of a course, met (a serving of several dishes), of which there could be several at a banquet. It punctuated each stage of a banquet, prepared the diners for the next serving and functioned as a conversation piece. The earliest recipe for an entremet can be found in an edition of Le Viandier, a medieval recipe collection from the early 14th century. It described a comparatively simple dish: boiled and fried chicken liver with chopped giblet, <b>ground</b> ginger, <b>cinnamon,</b> cloves, wine, verjuice, beef bouillon and egg yolks, served with cinnamon on top, and was supposed to be of a bright yellow color. An even simpler dish, like millet boiled in milk and seasoned with saffron, was also considered to be an entremet.|$|R
50|$|Curry powder is a spice {{mixture of}} widely varying {{composition}} {{developed by the}} British during {{the days of the}} Raj as a means of approximating the taste of Indian cuisine at home. Masala refers to spices, and this is the name given to the thick and pasty sauce based on a combination of spices with ghee (clarified butter), butter, palm oil or coconut milk. Most commercial curry powders available in Britain, the U.S. and Canada rely heavily on ground turmeric, in turn producing a very yellow sauce. Lesser ingredients in these Western yellow curry powders are often coriander, cumin, fenugreek, mustard, chili, black pepper and salt. By contrast, curry powders and curry pastes produced and consumed in India are extremely diverse; some red, some yellow, some brown; some with five spices and some with as many as 20 or more. Besides the previously mentioned spices, other commonly found spices in different curry powders in India are allspice, white pepper, ground mustard, <b>ground</b> ginger, <b>cinnamon,</b> roasted cumin, cloves, nutmeg, mace, green cardamom seeds or black cardamom pods, bay leaves and coriander seeds.|$|R
