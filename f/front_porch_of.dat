In one such deportation, Wiesenthal's mother and other elderly Jewish women were transported by freight train to Belzec extermination camp {{and killed in}} August 1942. Around the same time, a Ukrainian policeman shot Cyla's mother to death on the <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> her home in Buczacz while she was being evicted. Cyla and Simon Wiesenthal lost 89 relatives during the Holocaust.|$|E

The house of one of the jurors in the Dedham trial was bombed, throwing him and his family from their beds. On May 18, 1928, a bomb destroyed the <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> the home of executioner Robert Elliott. As late as 1932, Judge Thayer's home was wrecked and his wife and housekeeper were injured in a bomb blast. Afterward, Thayer lived permanently at his club in Boston, guarded 24 hours a day until his death on April 18, 1933.|$|E

500|$|News of {{the events}} at North Bonnie Brae St. quickly {{circulated}} among the African American, Latino and White residents of the city, and for several nights, various speakers would preach to the crowds of curious and interested onlookers from the <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> the Asberry home. Members of the audience included people from {{a broad spectrum of}} income levels and religious backgrounds. Hutchins eventually spoke in tongues as her whole congregation began to attend the meetings. Soon the crowds became very large and were full of people speaking in tongues, shouting, singing and moaning. Finally, the front porch collapsed, forcing the group to begin looking for a new meeting place.

500|$|Although {{it passed}} further west and was weaker than anticipated, the outerbands and {{fringe of the}} storm {{produced}} light rainfall and two tornadoes in the Florida Panhandle. The first tornado in the region was spawned near Greenwood in Jackson County, but caused no damage. The other tornado touched down near Graceville in Holmes County and ripped off the <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> a mobile home and downed numerous trees.

500|$|McKinley {{made himself}} {{available}} to the public every day except Sunday, receiving delegations from the <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> his home. The railroads subsidized the visitors with low excursion rates—the pro-silver Cleveland Plain Dealer disgustedly stated that going to Canton had been made [...] "cheaper than staying at home". Delegations marched through the streets from the railroad station to McKinley's home on North Market Street. Once there, they crowded close to the front porch—from which they surreptitiously whittled souvenirs—as their spokesman addressed McKinley. The candidate then responded, speaking on campaign issues in a speech molded to suit the interest of the delegation. The speeches were carefully scripted to avoid extemporaneous remarks; even the spokesman's remarks were approved by McKinley or a representative. This was done as the candidate feared an offhand comment by another that might rebound on him, as had happened to Blaine in 1884.|$|E

2500|$|Friends {{and family}} noted that Olds, {{although}} a [...] "hard-core, never-quit perfectionist," [...] had outlets for his energies besides his work.

His son Robin recalled {{that they would}} share afternoons sitting on the <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> their quarters at Langley Field, Virginia, watching planes land. His home at Langley was a social gathering place for numerous aviation pioneers, war veterans, and air power advocates that included Eddie Rickenbacker, Fiorello La Guardia, Ernst Udet, Roscoe Turner, Elliott White Springs, Jimmie Mattern, and Beirne Lay. When the gatherings included his neighbor, Lt. Col. Carl Spaatz, his son fondly noted, they often ended with singing accompanied by Olds on the piano and Spaatz on the guitar.|$|E
2500|$|According to Lev Anninsky, Pisemsky's {{personal}} mythology [...] "revolved {{around one}} word: fear."

Quite striking were his extraordinary collection of phobias and fears, along with general hypochondria." [...] In an 1880 letter to photographer Konstantin Shapiro who had recently published his gallery of Russian writers he confessed: [...] "My portrait repeats the one flaw which all of my photographic portraits have, my not knowing how to pose. In all of my photographs my eyes come out goggled and frightened and even somewhat mad, maybe because as they put me facing the camera obscura, I do experience – if not fear, then strong anxiety." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, Charles Village {{residents}} were challenged {{to take up}} a paint brush and choose vividly uncommon colors for the facades and <b>front</b> <b>porches</b> <b>of</b> their Victorian rowhouses. Within five years, residents had enlivened more than 100 homes, including several which the owners have repainted more than once. More was at stake, though, than just neighborly relations; the contest offered $3,000 for the best <b>front</b> <b>porch,</b> $2,000 for the best flush front facade and even $500 for the best front door. And as the painters increased, so did the number of competitions, to up to three times a year with new prizes. City blocks, best railings, and entire homes were up for judging. The contests ended in 2003, but Charles Village homeowners say they are looking for the funding to restart the contest. The contests' lasting result is that the neighborhood is now part of iconic Baltimore, with pictures of the [...] "Painted Ladies", as the homes are known, appearing on travel guides and magazine covers.|$|R

2500|$|After the Tallahassee Mission was burned, {{the council}} decided to rebuild {{and on a}} bigger scale, and to locate it further west, where more of the Creek people lived. The {{trustees}} selected a beautiful site {{on the south side}} of the Arkansas River, surrounded in the distance by several grand old mountains. Named for a nearby Creek town, it would be known as Wealaka Mission. A large and magnificent brick building, [...] x 42 and three stories high, was erected and was soon occupied by 100 children who were boarded and taught there. Having been appointed superintendent of the school, Loughridge opened it on November 1, 1882, and continued in charge for two years before he resigned from his position. After his two years at the Mission he began to preach in different places in the Creek Nation. Loughridge preached the first sermon in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1883, standing on the <b>front</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> a local store and in 1907 Loughridge founded and built the First Presbyterian Church of Coweta,check source - see Discussion which is now a museum and listed on the National Register of Historic Places list. He also translated books in the Creek language. The books prepared and published by Loughridge, with the assistance of his interpreter, were a hymn book, a catechism, translation of the Gospel of Matthew, a treatise on baptism, and a dictionary in two parts, Creek and English, and English and Creek. [...] In honor and memory of Loughridge's efforts in the Indian Territory, Camp Parthenia in Tulsa, Oklahoma was renamed Camp Loughridge in 1959.|$|E

5000|$|Those {{in favor}} of forms of non-neutral tiered Internet access argue that the Internet is already not a level playing field, that large {{companies}} achieve a performance advantage over smaller competitors by providing more and better-quality servers and buying high-bandwidth services. Should scrapping of net neutrality regulations precipitate a price drop for lower levels of access, or access to only certain protocols, for instance, such would make Internet usage more adaptable {{to the needs of}} those individuals and corporations who specifically seek differentiated tiers of service. Network expert Richard Bennett has written, [...] "A richly funded Web site, which delivers data faster than its competitors to the <b>front</b> <b>porches</b> <b>of</b> the Internet service providers, wants it delivered {{the rest of the way}} on an equal basis.
