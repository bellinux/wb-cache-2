5|$|Amnesic {{shellfish}} poisoning (ASP) {{was first}} reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It {{is caused by}} the substance <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> found in certain diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae out of the water. <b>Domoic</b> <b>acid</b> is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, gastroenteritis, long-term neurological problems or death. In an outbreak in the western United States in 1993, finfish were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms. In the United States and Canada, a regulatory limit of 20µg/g of <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> in shellfish meat is set.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{following}} the major decline in brown pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 pelicans were imported from Florida to augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide endrin. About 14,000 pelicans, including 7500 American white pelicans, perished from botulism after eating {{fish from the}} Salton Sea in 1990. In 1991 abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and Brandt's cormorants died at Santa Cruz, California, when their food fish (anchovies) were contaminated with neurotoxic <b>domoic</b> <b>acid,</b> produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{effect would}} {{be an increase in}} red tide events, which could contribute to the accumulation of toxins (<b>domoic</b> <b>acid,</b> brevetoxin, saxitoxin) in small organisms such as anchovies and shellfish, in turn increasing occurrences of amnesic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning and paralytic shellfish poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Although human illness due to <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{has only}} been {{associated}} with shellfish, the toxin can bioaccumulate in many marine organisms that consume phytoplankton, such as anchovies, and sardines. Intoxication by <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> in non-human organisms is frequently referred to as <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> poisoning or DAP. In mammals, including humans, <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> acts as a neurotoxin, causing permanent short-term memory loss, brain damage, and death in severe cases.|$|E

50|$|In 1999, using 13C- and 14C-labelled precursors, the {{biosynthesis}} of <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> in the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia was examined. After {{addition of}} 1,2-13C2-acetate, NMR spectroscopy showed enrichment of every carbon in <b>domoic</b> <b>acid,</b> indicating {{incorporation of the}} carbon isotopes. This enrichment was consistent with two biosynthetic pathways. The labeling pattern determined that <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> can be biosynthesized by an isoprenoid intermediate in combination with a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Domoic</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{structural}} analog of kainic acid, proline, and endogenous excitatory neurotransmiter glutamate. Ohfune and Tomita, {{who wanted to}} investigate its absolute stereochemistry, were {{the first and only}} to synthesize <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> in 1982.|$|E
50|$|There is {{no known}} {{antidote}} available for <b>domoic</b> <b>acid.</b> Therefore, if poisoning occurs, it is advised to go quickly to a hospital. Cooking or freezing affected fish or shellfish tissue that are contaminated with <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> does not lessen the toxicity.|$|E
5000|$|Bates et al. [...] {{was able}} to enhance <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{production}} in Pseudo-nitzschia multseries with the re-introduction of bacteria. Additionally, P. multiseries cultures which were completely axenic (bacteria-free), produce less <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> than P. multiseries cultures which have contained bacteria for several generations.|$|E
50|$|Diatoms produce <b>domoic</b> <b>acid,</b> another neurotoxin, {{which can}} cause {{seizures}} in higher vertebrates and birds as it concentrates up the food chain. <b>Domoic</b> <b>acid</b> readily accumulates in the bodies of shellfish, sardines, and anchovies, which if then eaten by sea lions, otters, cetaceans, birds or people, can affect the nervous system causing serious injury or death. In the summer of 2015, the state governments closed important shellfish fisheries in Washington, Oregon and California because of high concentrations of <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> in shellfish.|$|E
50|$|<b>Domoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{producing}} algal blooms {{are associated}} with the phenomenon of amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP). <b>Domoic</b> <b>acid</b> can bioaccumulate in marine organisms such as shellfish, anchovies, and sardines that feed on the phytoplankton known to produce this toxin. It can accumulate in high concentrations in the tissues of these plankton feeders when the toxic phytoplankton are high in concentration in the surrounding waters.Domoic acid is a neurotoxin that inhibits neurochemical processes, causing short-term memory loss, brain damage, and, in severe cases, death in humans. In marine mammals, <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> typically causes seizures and tremors.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> have been {{attributed}} to several mechanisms, but the one of concern is through glutamate receptors. <b>Domoic</b> <b>acid</b> is an excitatory amino acid analogue of glutamate; a neurotransmitter in the brain that activates glutamate receptors. <b>Domoic</b> <b>acid</b> has a very strong affinity for these receptors, which results in excitotoxicity initiated by an integrative action on ionotropic glutamate receptors at both sides of the synapse blocking the channel from rapid desensitization. In addition there is a synergistic effect with endogenous glutamate and N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonists that contribute to the excitotoxicity.|$|E

50|$|Many fish eat {{algae and}} other organisms that contain biotoxins (defensive {{substances}} against predators). Biotoxins accumulated in fish/shellfish include brevetoxins, okadaic acid, saxitoxins, ciguatoxin and <b>domoic</b> <b>acid.</b> Except for ciguatoxine, {{high levels of}} these toxins are only found in shellfish. Both <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> and ciguatoxine can be deadly to humans; the others will only cause diarrhea, dizzyness and a (temporary) feeling of claustrophobia.|$|E
5000|$|Amnesic {{shellfish}} poisoning (ASP) is {{an illness}} caused by {{consumption of the}} marine biotoxin called <b>domoic</b> <b>acid.</b> [...] This toxin is produced naturally by marine diatoms belonging to the genus Pseudo-nitzschia and the species Nitzschia navis-varingica. [...] When accumulated in high concentrations by shellfish during filter feeding, <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> can then {{be passed on to}} birds, marine mammals and humans via consumption of the contaminated shellfish.|$|E
50|$|There is {{no known}} {{antidote}} available for <b>domoic</b> <b>acid,</b> so if symptoms fit the description, it is advised to go quickly to a hospital.

50|$|In April 2007, a 4.08 m {{juvenile}} female {{minke whale}} died from <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> poisoning by ingesting northern anchovies - a known <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> vector - during an intense Pseudo-nitzschia bloom off Southern California. In March 2013, a severely emaciated 3.4 m juvenile male stranded at Nieuwpoort, Belgium. It {{was believed to}} have died after a prolonged starvation due to compacted plastic debris obstructing its digestive tract - the first confirmed case of death due to the ingestion of litter in a baleen whale. In May 2014, a 6.4 m individual that stranded at Atlantic City, New Jersey, tested positive for morbillivirus.|$|E

50|$|On June 22, 2006, a California brown pelican, {{possibly}} {{under the}} influence of <b>domoic</b> <b>acid,</b> flew through the windshield of a car on the Pacific Coast Highway. The phycotoxin is found in the local coastal waters.|$|E
50|$|The largest Pseudo-nitzschia bloom ever {{recorded}} occurred in September 2004 off the northwest {{coast of the}} United States. The maximum cell densities reached 13 x 106 cells per liter, with <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> levels of 1.3 pg DA/cell.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} be {{diagnosed}} and treated if poisoned, <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> must first be detected. Methods such as ELISA or probe development with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{may be used to}} detect the toxin or the organism producing this toxin.|$|E

50|$|As {{a public}} health concern, the {{concentration}} of <b>domoic</b> <b>acid</b> in shellfish and shellfish parts at point of sale should not exceed the current permissible limit of 20 mg/kg tissue.
