40|$|Marine macroalgae are {{important}} sources of sulfated polysaccharides with different structure according to each species of algae. These compounds from the seaweeds {{of the division}} Rhodophyta are mainly <b>galactans</b> consisting entirely of galactose or modified galactose units. <b>Galactans,</b> like agar and carrageenan have important biotechnological and commercial applications in several industries. The red seaweed Asparagopsis armata (Harvey), originally from the Pacific Ocean, is well established in Peniche beaches (west of Portugal) and other European locations and was classified as an invasive species. These red algae show complex hybrid <b>galactans</b> in their composition. The water–soluble polysaccharides were extracted from the gametophyte form of the seaweed, collected in March 2013 from Peniche coast, using a hot water extraction procedure. The yield (%) of the extraction and the galactose ratio content (mmol glucose %) were calculated. The polysaccharides were characterized by Infrared spectroscopy. The yield of polysaccharides was 16 % and the calculated galactose ratio was 0. 30 mmol glucose %. No significant statistical differences between the extraction procedures and the yield result were found. The FTIR spectra presented different bands, such as a band at 843. 59 cm- 1, characteristic of C 4 -O-S in galactose unit and a band at 764. 68 cm- 1 of C 2 -O-S (3. 6 -anidrogalactose). The complex hybrid <b>galactans</b> extracted from A. armata are easily obtained from simple extraction procedures.

These <b>galactans</b> in addition of being valuable products for pharmaceutical and food industries are low cost starting material for the preparation of useful and rare carbohydrate-based building blocks whose access by total synthesis is difficult and expensive. The semisynthesis of two sets of C-glycosyl aldehydes with L- and D-configuration from agarose and kappa-carrageenan respectively is described.

In order to study {{the function of the}} enzyme, active membrane and cell wall fractions from Mycobacterium smegmatis containing the overexpressed Rv 3782 protein were incubated with endogenous decaprenyldiphosphoryl-N-acetylglucosaminyl-rhamnose (C 50 -P-P-GlcNAc-Rha) as the primary substrate for <b>galactan</b> synthesis and UDP-[14 C]galactopyranose as the immediate precursor of UDP-[14 C]galactofuranose, the ultimate source of all of the galactofuranose (Galf) units of <b>galactan.</b> Obvious increased and selective synthesis of C 50 -P-P-GlcNAc-Rha-Galf-Galf, the earliest product in the pathway leading to the fully polymerized <b>galactan,</b> was observed, suggesting that Rv 3782 encodes a GalTr involved in the first stages of <b>galactan</b> synthesis.

Analysis of the genome of the plant pathogenic bacteria Erwinia chrysanthemi revealed the presence of a cluster of eight genes encoding proteins potentially involved in galactan utilization. The predicted transport system would comprise a specific porin GanL and an ABC transporter made of four proteins GanFGK 2. Degradation of <b>galactans</b> would be catalyzed by the periplasmic 1, 4 -beta-endogalactanase GanA which released oligogalactans from trimer to hexamer. After their transport through the inner membrane, oligogalactans would be degraded into galactose by the cytoplasmic 1, 4 -beta-exogalactanase GanB. Mutants affected for the porin or endogalactanase were unable to grow on <b>galactans</b> but they grew on galactose and on a mixture of galactotriose, galactotetraose, galactopentaose and galactohexaose. Mutants affected for the periplasmic galactan binding protein, the transporter ATPase or the exogalactanase were only able to grow on galactose. Thus, the phenotypes of these mutants confirmed the functionality of the gan locus in transport and catabolism of <b>galactans.</b> These mutations did not affect the virulence of E. chrysanthemi on chicory leaves, potato tubers or Saintpaulia ionantha, suggesting an accessory role of galactan utilization in the bacterial pathogeny...|$|E

Envenomation by L. muta is characterized by systemic (hypotension, bleeding and renal failure) and local effects (necrosis, pain and edema). The treatment to reverse the evolution of all the toxic effects is performed by injection of antivenom. However, such therapy does not effectively neutralize tissue damage or any other local effect, since in most cases victims delay seeking appropriate medical care. In this way, alternative therapies are in demand, and molecules from natural sources have been exhaustively tested. In this paper, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of a sulfated <b>galactan</b> obtained from the red seaweed Palisada flagellifera against some toxic activities of L. muta venom. Incubation of sulfated <b>galactan</b> with venom resulted in inhibition of hemolysis, coagulation, proteolysis, edema and hemorrhage.

40|$|The {{cell wall}} mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex is {{essential}} in mycobacterial species, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and is the target of several anti-tubercular drugs. For instance, ethambutol targets arabinogalactan biosynthesis through inhibition of the arabinofuranosyltransferases Mt-EmbA and Mt-EmbB. Following a detailed bioinformatics analysis of genes surrounding the conserved emb locus, we present the identification and characterization of a novel arabinofuranosyltransferase AftA (Rv 3792). The enzyme catalyzes {{the addition of the}} first key arabinofuranosyl residue from the sugar donor beta-D-arabinofuranosyl- 1 -monophosphoryldecaprenol to the <b>galactan</b> domain of the cell wall, thus "priming" the <b>galactan</b> for further elaboration by the arabinofuranosyltransferases. Because aftA is an essential gene in M. tuberculosis, we deleted its orthologue in Corynebacterium glutamicum to produce a slow growing but viable mutant. Analysis of its cell wall revealed the complete absence of arabinose resulting in a truncated cell wall structure possessing only a <b>galactan</b> core with a concomitant loss of cell wall-bound mycolates. Complementation of the mutant was fully restored to the wild type phenotype by Cg-aftA.

40|$|<b>Galactans</b> {{from red}} {{seaweeds}} have structures {{based on a}} linear chain of alternating 3 -linked β-D-galactopyranose residues (A units) and 4 -linked α-D- or α-L-galactopyra-nose residues or its 3, 6 -anhydro derivative (B units). The main classification of these <b>galactans</b> is made in carrageenans, when the B unit belongs to the D-series, and agarans, when the B unit is in the L-configuration (Figure 1). Carrageenans cover a broad dispersion of structures that have been grouped into three major types, namely kappa/iota-, mu/nu- and lambda-carrageenans, whereas agarans are not systematically classified (Duckworth & Yaphe, 1971). This clear-cut separation between carrageenans and agarans has been upset by the finding of a third group, named DL-galactan hybrids, in which the B units can have D- and L- configurations in the same molecule (Figure 1). According to the proportion of B units in the D- or L-configuration, the DL-galactan hybrids were divided into carrageenan DL-hybrids (major amount of D-type) and agaran DL-hybrids (major amount of L-type) (Stortz & Cerezo, 2000). When a hot water extract of the red seaweed Gymnogongrus torulosus was submitted to fractionation and enantiomeric analysis of the fractions, the system of <b>galactans</b> biosynthesized by the seaweed was mainly composed by carrageenan DL-hybrids, with minor quantities of agarans (Estevez et al., 2001).

Agardh) for Rhabdonia, Areschougia, Erythroclonium, and Austroclonium...|$|E
40|$|Incubation of {{purified}} {{cell wall}} fragments from corn (Zea mays) coleoptiles results in solubilization {{of some of}} the wall dry matter. The portion of the weight loss due to enzymatic autolysis is due mainly to solubilization of a glucan and, to a small extent, to liberation of free glucose. No other carbohydrate wall components or sugars other than glucose are solubilized despite the high concentrations of, for example, <b>galactans,</b> arabans, and xylans in the walls. The glucan has been partially characterized and found to be a lichenan-like polymer composed of 1 → 3 and 1 → 4 linked glucosyl units...|$|E
40|$|A linear 1, 4 -β-d-galactan {{has been}} {{prepared}} by partial acid hydrolysis {{of the major}} lupin seed polysaccharide on a preparative scale. The <b>galactan</b> has been characterized by acetylation and methylation analysis, by GPC, {{as well as by}} its 1 H- and 13 C-NMR-spectra. Sulfation with increasing amounts of SO 3 -pyridine yielded a series of <b>galactan</b> sulfates with increasing DS. In all derivatives, the sulfate groups had a similar pattern of distribution, as shown by methylation analysis. Beside unsulfated parts of the molecule, there were also parts with a multiple substitution patter...|$|R
40|$|Contagious bovine {{pleuropneumonia}} is {{a severe}} respiratory disease of cattle that {{is caused by}} a bacterium of the Mycoplasma genus, namely Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm). In the absence of classical virulence determinants, the pathogenicity of Mmm is thought to rely on intrinsic metabolic functions and specific components of the outer cell surface. One of these latter, the capsular polysaccharide <b>galactan</b> has been notably demonstrated {{to play a role in}} Mmm persistence and dissemination. The free exopolysaccharides (EPS), also produced by Mmm and shown to circulate in the blood stream of infected cattle, have received little attention so far. Indeed, their characterization has been hindered by the presence of polysaccharide contaminants in the complex mycoplasma culture medium. In this study, we developed a method to produce large quantities of EPS by transfer of mycoplasma cells from their complex broth to a chemically defined medium and subsequent purification. NMR analyses revealed that the purified, free EPS had an identical b(12. 6) - galactofuranosyl structure to that of capsular <b>galactan.</b> We then analyzed intraclonal Mmm variants that produce opaque/ translucent colonies on agar. First, we demonstrated that colony opacity was related to the production of a capsule, as observed by electron microscopy. We then compared the EPS extracts and showed that the non-capsulated, translucent colony variants produced higher amounts of free EPS than the capsulated, opaque colony variants. This phenotypic variation was associated with an antigenic variation of a specific glucose phosphotransferase permease. Finally, we conducted in silico analyses of candidate polysaccharide biosynthetic pathways in order to decipher the potential link between glucose phosphotransferase permease activity and attachment/release of <b>galactan.</b> The co-existence of variants producing alternative forms of <b>galactan</b> (capsular versus free extracellular <b>galactan)</b> and associated with an antigenic switch constitutes a finely tuned mechanism that may be involved in virulence.

In this work, novel amphiphilic glycopolypeptides {{were designed to}} incorporate lactose or <b>galactan</b> in order to prepare polymeric nanoassemblies with sizes below 50 nm. The bioactivity of the two different outer surface sugar units was evaluated by defining glycan relative binding affinities to human galectins 1 and 3. A specific multivalent effect was found only for polymeric nanoparticles displaying <b>galactan</b> with a significant increase of the binding activity as compared to free glycan in solution. Such synthetic designs present great potential as therapeutic tools to address galectin related pathologies...|$|R
