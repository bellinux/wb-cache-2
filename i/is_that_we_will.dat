The club appointed N M Rothschild & Sons to examine its financial situation and advise whether it was feasible for construction to press ahead {{at the end of}} March 2003. Although Arsenal secured a £260million loan from a group of banks led by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the club suspended work on Ashburton Grove in April 2003, saying, [...] "We have experienced a number of delays in arrangements for our new stadium project in recent months across a range of issues. The impact of these delays <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> now be unable to deliver a stadium opening {{for the start of the}} 2005–06 season." [...] The cost of building the stadium, forecasted at £400million, had risen by £100million during that period.|$|E

DLF did not renew their contract after their initial five-year contract, for [...] 2.50billion, ended with the previous season. PepsiCo's contract is [...] 3968million for five years, ending with the 2017 season. In response to questions about the higher sponsorship costs compared to DLF's, a representative of PepsiCo said, [...] "Our estimate <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> get five to six times {{the value of the}} money we paid." [...] However, Brand Finance had assessed the IPL's brand value to have fallen from $4.1 billion in 2010 to $2.9 billion in 2012, attributed to the decline in television ratings over the two years.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} notable storylines {{featuring}} Pete revolved around the paternity of his alleged son, Simon Wicks (Nick Berry). Pete was shell-shocked to discover that Simon, was not really his child, {{and that he was}} possibly the son of his brother Kenny (Michael Attwell). The storyline spanned several years, since the arrival of Pete's first wife Pat (Pam St. Clement) in 1986, until the long-awaited showdown between Pete, Pat and Kenny in February 1988. The episode written by Tony McHale contained shocking revelations that would affect several relationships on the Square for years to come. In the on-screen events, Simon was shown to bond with Kenny, despite Pat admitting that she did not know which of the Beale brothers had fathered Wicksy. A final plot twist mid-1988 saw Pat finally reveal what she thought was the truth, that Simon's real father was Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield), Pat's second husband and Wicksy's adoptive father. Despite this revelation on-screen, writer Colin Brake stated in an official EastEnders book in 1994 that the true parentage of Simon was still uncertain {{in the minds of the}} producers. He stated, [...] "At various times over the years the story has been amended, until the only certainty <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> never be certain about the actual facts."

50|$|There {{are several}} {{problems}} with defining relations for C*-algebras. One is, as previously mentioned, {{due to the}} non-existence of free C*-algebras, not every relation defines a C*-algebra. Another problem is that one would often want to include order relations, formulas involving continuous functional calculus, and spectral data as relations. For that reason, we use a relatively roundabout way of defining C*-algebra relations. The basic motivation behind the following definitions <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> define relations as the category of their representations.|$|E
