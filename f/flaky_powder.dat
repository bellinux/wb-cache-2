6000|$|We had {{the first}} watch from eight to midnight. The wind was soon blowing half a gale, and our sailing-master {{expected}} little sleep that night as he paced {{up and down the}} poop. The topsails were soon clewed up and made fast, then the flying jib run down and furled. Quite a sea was rolling by this time, occasionally breaking over the decks, flooding them and threatening to smash the boats. At six bells we were ordered to turn them over and put on storm lashings. This occupied us till eight bells, when we were relieved by the mid-watch. I was the last to go below, doing so just as the watch on deck was furling the spanker. Below all were asleep except our green hand, the [...] "bricklayer," [...] who was dying of consumption. The wildly dancing movements of the sea lamp cast a pale, flickering light through the fo'castle and turned to golden honey the drops of water on the yellow oilskins. In all the corners dark shadows seemed to come and go, while up in the eyes of her, beyond the pall bits, descending from deck to deck, where they seemed to lurk like some dragon at the cavern's mouth, it was dark as Erebus. Now and again, the light seemed to penetrate for a moment as the schooner rolled heavier than usual, only to recede, leaving it darker and blacker than before. The roar of the wind through the rigging came to the ear muffled like the distant rumble of a train crossing a trestle or the surf on the beach, while the loud crash of the seas on her weather bow seemed almost to rend the beams and planking asunder as it resounded through the fo'castle. The creaking and groaning of the timbers, stanchions, and bulkheads, as the strain the vessel was undergoing was felt, served to drown the groans of the dying man as he tossed uneasily in his bunk. The working of the foremast against the deck beams caused a shower of <b>flaky</b> <b>powder</b> to fall, and sent another sound mingling with the tumultous storm. Small cascades of water streamed from the pall bits from the fo'castle head above, and, joining issue with the streams from the wet oilskins, ran along the floor and disappeared aft into the main hold.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aluminum nitride was {{synthesized}} by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) with <b>flaky</b> aluminum <b>powder</b> {{in various}} {{conditions such as}} particle size, nitrogen pressure (PN 2), dilution factor (fDil), packing density, and bulk sample size. AlN content in the SHS product increases with an increase of fDil, and it eventually reaches about 95 % at fDil= 0. 6. Generally, reaction front velocity is significantly affected by PN 2 and packing density, but not by fDil. The degree of AlN conversion reduces more or less with an increase of bulk sample size, but that could be improved by using the SHS pre-prepared product as a diluent...|$|R

Short-time (6 h) ball-milling of amorphous precursor {{was used to}} prepare <b>flaky</b> <b>powder.</b> The temperature-/time-resolved structural and microstructure evolution of the Fe-rich amorphous alloy during non-isothermal heating was investigated by in-situ angular-dispersive X-ray diffraction (XRD) at the high-resolution powder diffractometer at the B 2 bending magnet beamline. The synchrotron radiation wavelength was set to λ = 0. 4933 Å. The heating experiments were performed using a STOE furnace and an OBI image plate detector [1]. The powder sample was mounted in quartz capillary having an outer diameter of 0. 3 mm. X-ray diffraction patterns were collected in Debye-Scherrer geometry upon constant-rate heating (1. 23 °C/min) up to 800 °C. Figure 1 shows the series of XRD patterns collected upon constant-rate (1. 23 °C/min) heating of FeSiCuNbB powder. As {{can be seen from}} that figure, initialy amporphous powder undergoes crystallization at 525 °C. The peaks appearing after annealing at 525 °C originate from cubic Fe 3 Si phase, which is responsible for soft magnetic behaviour of investigated alloy. Further increase of temperature up to 700 °C leads to formation of secondary phase/s (most probably iron borides), which are responsible for magnetic hardening.

Although the rhombohedral phase of (Y 0. 25 Bi 0. 75) 2 O 3 {{was known to be}} the stable phase at temperatures 600 °C, {{it was found that the}} annealed (Y 0. 25 Bi 0. 75) 2 O 3 was not thermodynamically stable in the water-containing environment.

The monoclinic –Bi 2 O 3 further reacted with CO 2 and formed Bi 2 O 2 CO 3. Consequently, the annealed (Y 0. 25 Bi 0. 75) 2 O 3 degraded and became <b>flaky</b> <b>powder.</b> Scanning electron microscopy micrographs of water-reacted (Y 0. 25 Bi 0. 75) 2 O 3 also showed surface swelling and peeling.

40|$|The reaction-sintered alumina and zirconia-alumina {{ceramics}} {{with low}} firing shrinkage were prepared from Al 2 O 3 /Al and ZrO 2 (Ca-PSZ) /Al powder mixture by attrition milling {{and the effect}} of the characteristics of used ceramic <b>powders</b> was investigated. <b>Flaky</b> Al <b>powders</b> mixed with coarse alumina powders could be effectively pulverized due to high hardness of alumina powders. On the contrary fused Ca-PSZ/Al powder mixture could not be effectively comminuted due to lower hardness than alumina powders. So by using hard alumina ball media or coarse Al 2 O 3 powders rather than Al, the milling efficiency could be much more increased. After attrition milling the Al 2 O 3 /Al specimens were oxidized at 1200 ℃ for 8 hours and followed by sintering at 1550 ℃ for 3 hours. Because mixed powders of Al with alumina were much more effectively comminuted, more than 97 % theoretical density of sintered body could be achieved. In the case of fused Ca-PSZ powder reaction-sintered with Al at 1550 ℃ for 3 hours, the reaction-sintering and densification were a little more difficult than Al 2 O 3 /Al specimens because of the insufficient milling. And the unstabilization of Ca-PSZ body which caused the cracks in the specimens was brought by the diffusion of Ca ion from Ca-PSZ grains to alumina. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} a novel method for {{synthesis}} {{of a dark}} magnetic flake powder for detecting latent fingerprint has been developed. Even though, flake powders,of aluminium, brass and highly reflective magnetic iron flake are already in use in crime scenes, it is highly desirable to develop a suitable darker variety of magnetic flake powder for print development on light background surfaces. In order to achieve rapid production of dark metal flakes, a new high energy prototype vibratory mill has been designed, manufactured and develo ed. The design concepts were developed following {{a comprehensive review of}} the various commercially available milling devices and undertaking some initial experimentation. The mechanical milling process which results in changing the particle morphology of starting atomised iron <b>powder</b> to <b>flaky</b> shaped <b>powder</b> was investigated in terms of different milling phases like micro forging, fracture and agglomeration. The effect of milling process parameters on the flake quality was investigated. It was shown that the amount of stearic acid content, ball packing fraction and weight loading were important parameters in determining the final flake qualities. The quality of latent fingerprint development with the dark flake powder was investigated. Some of the flake powders produced excellent ridge quality details with good adherence quality on a range of background surfaces. The present study has been able to establish the relationship between the visual characteristics (dark) and adherence property of the flake fingerprint powder with respect to the particle dimensions and surface characteristics of the flakes. It was also found that finer flakes are darker in colour and the low weight percentage of stearic acid has produced the best adherence quality for the dark flake powder. Some unique relationship between the flake dimensions with the nature of the print deposit was also established as it was found that slightly coarser flakes are suitable for heavy print deposit whereas finer flakes are more sensitive to aged prints. Further, the role of process variables in influencing the milling process were established such that optimum conditions by vibration milling can be determined to obtain dark flakes of desired quality. While the weight loading significantly influenced the milling behaviour of the powder, the role of stearic acid as an additive was found to influence the surface quality of flakes, besides restricting particle welding. Increasing the pre determined theoretical ball size does not result in faster milling, but increasing the ball packing fraction from 50...|$|R
40|$|Magister Pharmaceuticae - MPharmLeonotis leonurus, a South African {{indigenous}} medicinal plant, {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} form of a tea. However, this dosage form has many disadvantages. Consequently three L. leonurus solid extract preparations were prepared and explored as possible replacements of the tea form, but very little was known about their physical and chemical stability during storage. The specific objectives were to: (i) prepare a freeze dried aqueous extract (FDAE), 20 % aqueous ethanol (Aq EtOH) extract and calcium alginate beads of the FDAE form of L. leonurus, (ii) characterize the extracts using parameters of select physical and chemical features and, (iii) determine the long-term stability of the extracts. It was hypothesised that the Aq EtOH extract would contain higher levels of chemical marker compounds (marrubiin and leonurine) than the FDAE and calcium alginate FDAE beads of L. leonurus and, that the calcium alginate FDAE beads would have greater stability (i. e. longer shelf-life) than the FDAE and the Aq EtOH extract. The three L. leonurus solid extracts were prepared using accepted published methods. For the physical characterization of the extracts, the organoleptic properties were determined using the natural senses (e. g. sight, smell, taste, etc.) and for chemical characterization, total phenol content (TPC; using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent method), total flavonoid content (TFC; using aluminium chloride-methanol solution) and antioxidant activity (using the -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay). To establish the long-term stability of the preparations, encapsulated L. leonurus solid extracts was stored in sealed standard plastic containers at four conditions: (A), room temperature of 24 ˚C ± 5 ˚C; (B), fixed temperature of 30 ˚C ± 5 ˚C and (C), elevated temperature of 40 ˚C ± 5 ˚C for 6 months, and (D), accelerated stability test conditions of 40 ˚C ± 5 ˚C / 75 % RH for 4 weeks. Samples of the stored encapsulated preparations were collected periodically and assessed for changes in organoleptic properties, TPC, TFC, antioxidant activity levels and marker compound (i. e. marrubiin and leonurine) levels. The latter was determined by validated HPLC assay. Yields of 19. 9, 12. 82 and 10. 7 % of FDAE, Aq EtOH extract and calcium alginate FDAE beads were obtained, respectively. Physically the calcium alginate beads contained less moisture (1. 86 %) than the FDAE (3. 77 %) and Aq EtOH (2. 91 %). Chemically the FDAE, Aq EtOH extract and calcium alginate FDAE beads respectively had appreciable and similar TPC (i. e. 7. 86, 7. 52 &, 6. 94 mg GAE/g; p > 0. 05; Anova) and TFC (i. e. 4. 30, 4. 47 & 3. 67 mg QE/g; p > 0. 05; Anova) levels, but variable amounts of marrubiin (i. e. 22. 5, 17. 5, and 0. 4 ug/mg plant extract) and leonurine (i. e. 2. 0, 1. 4 and 0. 7 ug/mg plant extract), respectively. The antioxidant activity levels were also different i. e. EC 50 values of 7. 71, 6. 66 and 11. 53 mg/mL (student t-test p-value of < 0. 0001; ANOVA-test; p< 0. 05) for the FDAE, Aq EtOH extract and calcium alginate FDAE beads, respectively. During storage (i. e. stability study) the L. leonurus solid extracts generally remained physically unaffected by temperature (i. e. no significant change in organoleptic features), but when exposed to humidity the FDAE and Aq EtOH extracts showed clear signs of physical degradation i. e. changed from being <b>flaky</b> <b>powders</b> to sticky melted masses, while the calcium alginate beads remained unchanged. Within 1 month storage at RT, 30 °C, 40 °C and 1 week at 40 °C / 75 % RH the TPC of the encapsulated FDAE decreased significantly by 61, 60, 58 and 52 %, respectively, that for the encapsulated Aq EtOH extract by 61, 54, 46 and 50 %, respectively, and for calcium alginate FDAE beads by 66, 71, 59 and 57 %, respectively. Using TPC as a stability parameter all three encapsulated extracts had very short shelf-lives ranging from 1. 24 weeks (0. 31 months) to 3. 72 weeks (0. 93 months). Under the same conditions and storage periods (i. e. 1 month & 1 week) the TFC of the encapsulated FDAE decreased significantly by 25, 25, 29 and 66 %, respectively, for encapsulated Aq EtOH extract by 26, 26, 23 and 70 %, respectively, and the calcium alginate FDAE beads by 55, 55, 52 and 64 %, respectively. The results obtained for TFC was thus similar to that obtained for the TPC data. Based on the TFC data all three encapsulated extracts had very short shelf-lives ranging, from 1. 56 weeks (0. 39 months) to 6. 76 weeks (1. 69 months). Under the same conditions and storage periods (i. e. 1 month & 1 week) as that used to determine TPC and TFC, the antioxidant activity of the extracts changed little, i. e. decreased by 0. 2, 0. 1, 0. 8 and 2 %, respectively for FDAE, by 0. 7 %, 1 %, 0. 1 % and 5. 3 %, respectively for the Aq EtOH and by 2, 2, 1. 4 and 0. 8 %, respectively for the calcium alginate FDAE beads. Moreover, based on antioxidant activity, all three encapsulated extracts had relatively long shelf-lives ranging from 15. 6 weeks (3. 9 months) to 22. 4 weeks (5. 6 months). Finally, the determination of the stability of the encapsulated L. leonurus extracts stored under stress conditions (i. e. 40 °C / 75 % RH) and based on marker compound levels was unresolved. Between the time of extract preparation and characterisation until start of the stability study the marrubiin levels in the FDAE, Aq. ETOH and calcium beads had decreased from 22. 5, 17. 5, and 0. 4 ug/mg plant extract, respectively, to 0. 30, 0. 11, 0. 30 μg/mg, respectively, and the leonurine levels from 2. 0, 1. 4 and 0. 7 to 0. 46, 0. 38 and 0. 09 μg/mg, respectively and was too low to conduct a meaningful stability study with the developed validated assay. Overall, all three the encapsulated L. leonurus solid extracts studied were clearly very unstable and did not have suitable long-term storage stability. The modification of the freeze-dried aqueous extract of L. leonurus into a calcium alginate bead form seemed to combat physical instability but did not improve the chemical instability of the aqueous extract. It is therefore recommended that the addition of excipients or other post extract modification (e. g. production of phytosomes) be explored to combat the hygroscopicity of L. leonurus FDAE and ultimately improve its overall product stability...|$|R
40|$|Various {{proposed}} metallic {{nuclear fuel}} designs for fast reactors may require powder fabrication methods and the reactive nature of uranium metal creates unique challenges. Spherical powder is desired in some fuel concepts over <b>flaky</b> or irregular <b>powder</b> {{because it will}} enable predictable packing fractions, even for low density fuels. A previously-established method for powder production is the Rotating Electrode Process (REP) which produces microsphere shaped powder by melting {{the tip of a}} rotating cylinder via electric arc. As droplets of molten metal are expelled radially outward, they solidify into spherical particles. A new REP system, named the TAMU Rotating Electrode System (TAMU RES), was developed at Texas A&M University in a previous study. This RES apparatus was placed inside of an inert atmosphere glovebox for this present study to enable uranium powder manufacture. The RES is based on previous designs by Starmet Co. and the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). It is capable of melting a metal rod up to 12. 7 cm (5 inches) in length and 1. 27 cm (0. 5 inches) in diameter as it rotates up to 19, 000 RPM. The RES is capable of operating at speeds up to 40, 000 RPM provided no mechanical instabilities are present in the rotating cylinder. Varying the RPM alters the diameter of the spheres produced in a predictable fashion, but {{in a manner that is}} unique to each material melted by the RES. The RES is capable of producing repeatable powder size distributions. Copper, depleted uranium (DU), and U- 10 wt% Zr (U- 10 Zr) powders were produced using the RES and their size distributions were characterized as a function of RPM for rotational speeds varying between 10, 000 and 19, 000 RPM. The copper powders were produced in both air and argon atmospheres, while the uranium and U- 10 Zr powders were produced under an argon atmosphere to prevent oxidation of the microspheres. Problems and areas of concern like material flaking and rotational instability issues were overcome by the installation of a helium cooling line inside the catch pan, and by selecting mechanically straight rods for melting. Continued characterization work of powders produced by the RES is also addressed...|$|R
