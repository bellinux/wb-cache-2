5|$|Halo 3 is {{the final}} game in the main Halo trilogy, ending the story arc begun in Halo: Combat Evolved. The game was {{released}} on the Xbox 360 on September 25, 2007. <b>It</b> <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> the series new vehicles, new weapons, and a class of items called equipment. The game also includes a limited map-editing tool, known as the Forge, which allows players to insert game objects, such as weapons and crates, into existing multiplayer map geometry. Players can also save a recording of their gameplay sessions, and view them as video, from any angle.|$|E

Street children often spend very little on clothing because their employers often provide clothes for work or their families occasionally give them clothes if they {{know where they are}} living.

25|$|Soil {{respiration}} {{is a key}} ecosystem {{process that}} releases carbon from the soil {{in the form of}} CO2. CO2 is acquired from the atmosphere and converted into organic compounds in the process of photosynthesis. Plants use these organic compounds to build structural components or respire them to release energy. When plant respiration occurs below-ground in the roots, <b>it</b> <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> soil respiration. Over time, plant structural components are consumed by heterotrophs. This heterotrophic consumption releases CO2 and when this CO2 is released by below-ground organisms, it is considered soil respiration.|$|E
25|$|Plants respire some of {{the carbon}} {{compounds}} which were generated by photosynthesis. When this respiration occurs in roots, <b>it</b> <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> soil respiration. Root respiration usually accounts for approximately half of all soil respiration. However, these values can range from 10–90% depending on the dominate plant types in an ecosystem and conditions under which the plants are subjected. Thus the amount of CO2 produced through root respiration {{is determined by the}} root biomass and specific root respiration rates. efflux rates for a central Siberian Pinus sylvestris forest.

25|$|Supporters of {{the event}} argue that the horses are well cared for, {{before and after the}} race itself. At the Calgary Stampede, {{officials}} work closely with local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Calgary Humane Society staff to ensure that the horses are fit enough to endure the race. Wagon drivers express sadness over the periodic deaths of horses at the Stampede, explaining that, while unfortunate, animal injury and death are a normal element of any ranch or farming operation. Critics counter that chuckwagon racing is simply an adrenailine sport and produces no food. Thus the practice is an unnecessary and cruel risk to force horses to take. It is unclear how broad public support for the sport actually is, although it has been a marquee event for the Calgary Stampede for many decades, perhaps {{in part because of the}} possibility of disaster and the drama <b>it</b> <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> the Stampede as entertainment.|$|E

Hugh Laurie recorded a cover of the song {{around the time of}} its selection to the National Recording Registry. He commented about the mystery as follows: [...] "I thought it was better not knowing. <b>It</b> <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> its mystique and its power to make me laugh and cry all in one go." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1892, Evans {{moved to}} Ventnor on the Isle of Wight, {{and turned the}} {{printing}} business over to his sons Wilfred and Herbert, although when he stopped engraving wood is unknown. During his last decade he wrote The Reminiscences of Edmund Evans, a short volume he described as [...] "the rambling jottings of an old man". In that book Evans includes few details of his business practices and processes, and is significant because <b>it</b> <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> the scant information available on the colour printers of the era. In the 1960s, Ruari McLean edited the unrevised 102-page typescript released to him by Evans' grandson which was published by the Oxford University Press in 1967.|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{designed}} Two-Face's {{appearance in}} the film {{as one of the}} least disturbing, explaining, [...] "When we looked at less extreme versions of it, they were too real and more horrifying. When you look at a film like Pirates of the Caribbean– something like that, there's something about a very fanciful, very detailed visual effect, that I think is more powerful and less repulsive." [...] Framestore created 120 computer-generated shots of Two-Face's scarred visage. Nolan felt using make-up would look unrealistic, as <b>it</b> <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> the face, unlike real burn victims. Framestore acknowledged they rearranged the positions of bones, muscles and joints to make the character look more dramatic. For each shot, three 720-pixel HD cameras were set up at different angles on set to fully capture Aaron Eckhart's performance. Eckhart wore markers on his face and a prosthetic skullcap, which acted as a lighting reference. A few shots of the skullcap were kept in the film. Framestore also integrated shots of Bale and Eckhart into that of the exploding building where Dent is burned. It was difficult simulating fire on Eckhart because it is inherently unrealistic for only half of something to burn.|$|E
500|$|Dave Golder of SFX {{gave the}} episode {{four out of}} five stars, {{describing}} it as [...] "slight and fluffy and silly, with the occasional creaky bit of plotting ... but enormously entertaining". He was pleased that the guest characters were played [...] "straight" [...] rather than for comedy, and found the dinosaur effects [...] "great" [...] and the Silurian twist [...] "enriching continuity". However, he felt that the teaser was too fast-paced, Nefertiti was [...] "rather bland", and wrote that it was unlikely the Doctor would have a friendship with a big game hunter. IGN's Matt Risley rated [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" [...] 7 out of 10, noting that it [...] "isn't going to win any awards for scriptwriting or pathos, but it certainly succeeded on a family-friendly level full of whimsy". Though he wrote that Brian was [...] "brilliant", he overall criticised the [...] "gang", feeling that they [...] "served little purpose other than to inject some conveniently timed plot devices when needed". He also did not like the [...] "bickering Marvin the Paranoid Android-lite" [...] robots. However, Neela Debnath of The Independent enjoyed the gang, writing, [...] "the more companions there are the more variety <b>it</b> <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> the show because each one has their own flaws and backstory".|$|E

500|$|Doug Pratt, a DVD {{reviewer}} and Rolling Stone contributor, {{thought the}} episode's story was [...] "nicely composed, so you don't {{have to recognize}} the Citizen Kane references to appreciate the effort, but <b>it</b> <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> the fun." [...] He also noted that it begins the exploration of Mr. Burns [...] "in earnest, {{the first of many}} characters who will receive elaborate coverage as the series advances." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk thought both Lisa's [...] "tremendous intellect" [...] and Marge's [...] "moral compass" [...] were [...] "probed" [...] in the episode, and he thought one [...] "clear highlight" [...] of the episode was Burns's attempts to explain away Blinky's mutation by turning to an actor portraying Charles Darwin who proceeds to give a speech suggesting that Blinky is merely advanced. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "The episode took an unusual approach for an early show, as it focused largely on a secondary character. One could argue that season one’s 'Krusty Gets Busted' did the same, but 'Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish' provided a heavier emphasis on Burns than that prior program did Krusty. This helped make it a fairly good episode. It fleshed out Burns’ character a little better and gave us a reasonably entertaining experience. The episode fell short of greatness, but it worked nicely for the most part." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "masterful".|$|E
500|$|The Baltimore Sun {{journalist}} Andrew Conrad commended the episode, citing {{that the}} episodic pace was {{faster than the}} preceding episode. Josh Wigler of MTV opined: [...] "Tonight's episode was all about pairs. Shane and Otis, two soldiers in a foxhole. Rick and Lori, two parents at odds over how to handle their son's failing condition. Glenn and Maggie, two strangers desperate to make a connection. Andrea and Daryl, two opposites {{trying to find a}} reason to move on. Great scenes with all of these duos, and it really goes to show just how fantastic The Walking Dead cast is, both in the loud and quiet moments." [...] Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a 'B+' grade, and felt that the episode was superior to the previous episode. In contrast, Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal was less enthusiastic about the episode, expressing, [...] "truth be told, after three episodes very little has happened so far this season." [...] TV Fanatic Sean McKenna asserted that despite not having any direction, [...] "Save the Last One" [...] managed to retain the [...] "tension and action that makes this show a thrill ride every week." [...] He added: [...] "I'm sure for some the slow pace in real time is something of a bother, but for me <b>it</b> <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> the intensity of the characters' situation and the show itself." [...] McKenna ultimately gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Similarly, Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy stated that the episode was the strongest installment of the season as well as amongst the series' best installments.|$|E

2500|$|However, this {{solution}} was not adequate for mathematically-oriented languages such as FORTRAN (1955) and ALGOL (1958), which used the hyphen as an infix subtraction operator.

This approach was abandoned in later languages due to the complexity <b>it</b> <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> tokenization.
