5|$|Tunnels is a {{subterranean}} fiction {{novel by}} British authors Roderick Gordon and Brian Williams. It was initially self-published as The Highfield Mole in 2005, and re-released as Tunnels by Chicken House in 2007. The story follows Will Burrows, a 14-year-old 'archaeologist', who stumbles upon an underground civilization called The Colony. Will and friend Chester flee The Colony {{and set out}} to find Will's father, in the Deeps, a place <b>even</b> <b>deeper</b> in the Earth than The Colony.|$|E
5|$|Formation of {{approximately}} the current {{depth of the}} Colorado River's Grand Canyon by 1.2 mya further caused its tributaries to cut down <b>even</b> <b>deeper.</b> Headward erosion {{of one of those}} tributaries, the Paria River, eroded north-northwestward toward what is now Paria Amphitheater. The river took a route roughly parallel to and east of the Paunsaugunt Fault. Erosion from snow and rain that fall directly on the east-facing rim of the Paunsaugunt Plateau forms gullies that widen into alcoves and amphitheaters while differential erosion and frost wedging create the hoodoos. Streams on the plateau do not contribute to the formation of alcoves or amphitheaters because they flow away from the rim. Erosion continues in this fashion today.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} sequel, Devil May Cry 2, Dante {{is shown to}} have a habit of {{flipping}} a coin to make his decisions, although it is revealed {{at the end of}} the game that both sides of the coin are heads. Set some time after the first game, Devil May Cry 2 focuses on aiding the character Lucia in defeating Arius, an international businessman who uses demonic power and seeks to conquer the world. At the end of the game, Dante must go into the demon world to stop a demon lord from escaping, but the gate closes behind him and he is trapped. With no way back to the human world, Dante heads <b>even</b> <b>deeper</b> into the demon world on his motorcycle.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} earthquake, the News-Miner placed {{an order for}} a modern offset {{printing}} press. To house the new press, which could not fit in the Lathrop Building, Snedden ordered {{the construction of a}} new printing facility and office—named the Aurora Building—north of the Chena River. The Alaska Railroad sold Snedden the land for the building, which was built at a cost of $1 million in 1965. Snedden ordered the foundation for the new building to be raised 22 inches above the 100-year flood line. This fact saved the News-Miner two years later, when a massive flood swept through Fairbanks. The water was three inches deep throughout the paper's offices and <b>even</b> <b>deeper</b> in the press and boiler rooms, which were slightly below that raised level. The flood halted production for a time, and the Anchorage Times reciprocated the post-earthquake favor by publishing the News-Miner's masthead on its editions and posting occasional stories from Fairbanks until electrical power was restored to the town.|$|E
5|$|They are soon {{captured}} by the police of the underground community, known as the Colony. In prison, Will is visited by Mr. Jerome, and his son Cal. They reveal Will was actually born in the Colony, {{and that they are}} his real family; Mr. Jerome his father and Cal his younger brother. Will is eventually released from the prison and taken to the Jerome's home, where Will and Cal's Uncle Tam is delighted to see him and informs Will that his adoptive father, Dr. Burrows, was recently there, and had willingly traveled down into the Deeps — a place <b>even</b> <b>deeper</b> in the Earth than The Colony. Will learns that the Styx, the religious rulers of the Colony, are either going to enslave Chester or banish him to the Deeps to fend for himself. Will refuses to abandon his friend, and Uncle Tam formulates a plan for him to rescue Chester and to take him back to the surface.|$|E

50|$|Whereas most dragons in European mythology {{are linked}} to the {{elements}} of fire and destruction, dragons in Korean mythology are primarily benevolent beings related to water and agriculture, often considered bringers of rain and clouds.

25|$|An {{article in}} The Scientist notes, “The {{difficulties}} associated with using animal models for human disease {{result from the}} metabolic, anatomic, and cellular differences between humans and other creatures, but the problems go <b>even</b> <b>deeper</b> than that” including issues with the design and execution of the tests themselves.|$|E
25|$|Thomson was {{intrigued}} but sceptical.

25|$|Reform claimed {{credit for}} {{pressuring}} the Liberal government to initiate spending cuts {{and focus on}} deficit reduction in 1995, though the party had wanted <b>even</b> <b>deeper</b> cuts. It also managed to put forward its own strategy for national unity after the slim federalist victory in the 1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty, which advocated deep decentralization of powers {{from the federal government}} to the provinces and territories. Manning was attacked, however, for not appearing at federalist rallies in Quebec, as Prime Minister Chrétien and new Progressive Conservative leader Jean Charest had done.|$|E
25|$|Around 3:00 pm {{the most}} recent Austro-Russian attack was repulsed from the line of heights. By this time Watrin had {{positioned}} his division on the heights {{to the east of}} Novi. Lusignan's grenadiers made three frontal attacks on Watrin without breaking through. Meanwhile, Loudon's grenadiers approached Watrin's right flank and Mittrowsky's command threatened an <b>even</b> <b>deeper</b> envelopment. In the face of the new attacks, Watrin's division crumbled. Saint-Cyr threw the 106th Line Demi Brigade into a counterattack which stopped the Austrians and captured Lusignan, who was wounded. By 5:00 pm, Watrin and the 106th were finally beaten by superior numbers and retreated. On the opposite flank Kray attacked again between 3:00 and 4:00 pm.|$|E
25|$|As {{the use of}} {{the long}} drum began to spread across Europe, many composers and musicians started looking for <b>even</b> <b>deeper</b> tones {{that could be used in}} compositions. As a result of this demand, a narrow-shelled, {{single-headed}} drum called the gong drum was introduced in Britain during the 19th century. This drum, which was 70-100 centimeters in diameter and deep-shelled, was similar to the long drum in both size and construction. When struck, the gong drum produced a deep sound with a rich resonance. However, the immense size of the drum, coupled with the fact that there was not a second head to help balance the sound, meant that gong drums tended to produce a sound with a definite pitch. As a result, they fell out of favor with many composers, as it became nearly impossible to incorporate them in an orchestra in any meaningful way.|$|E

25|$|An {{exchange}} of three punts brought the game {{into the second}} quarter, where Morris ran for 34 yards on the second play of a Patriots drive {{to put them in}} the Broncos' red zone yet again. Four plays later, on 4th-and-1 from the Broncos' 4-yard line, Morris ran for a 4-yard touchdown that gave the Patriots a 13–0 lead. The Broncos' next drive ended with Meriweather intercepting a deep throw by Cutler, setting up the Patriots' next series at their own 16-yard line. After a sack of Cassel put the Patriots <b>even</b> <b>deeper</b> into their own territory, a facemask penalty on Cassel on third down by Broncos linebacker Jamie Winborn gave the Patriots a new set of downs. Five plays later, on another 4th-and-1, Morris ran for 29 yards to give the Patriots a first down from the Broncos' 13-yard line; he ran for a total of 138 yards on 16 carries. On the next play, Moss caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from Cassel to extend the Patriots' lead to 20–0. The Broncos' next drive began with backup Patrick Ramsey replacing Cutler at quarterback. On the fourth play, defensive lineman Mike Wright sacked Ramsey and forced a fumble, which undrafted free agent linebacker Gary Guyton caught to give the Patriots the ball at midfield. Cassel suffered his fifth sack on the next play, the final of the first half.|$|E
