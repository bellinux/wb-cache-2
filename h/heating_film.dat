By the fundamental theory of film technique {{and a lot of}} experimental studies, the suitable base material and source material for large power heating electrical conductive film was obtained. The experimental method, which needs simple equipment, costs little, has short period of film formation and can form on a large area, has been proposed on the premise that the film has good properties. The film electrical conduction mechanism and various parameters affecting the film electrical characteristics have also been studied.

40|$|A {{rapidly growing}} {{interest}} in wearable electronics {{has led to the}} development of stretchable and transparent heating films that can replace the conventional brittle and opaque heaters. Herein, we describe the rapid production of large-area, stretchable and transparent electrodes using electrospun ultra-long metal nanofibers (mNFs) and demonstrate their potential use as wirelessly operated wearable heaters. These mNF networks provide excellent optoelectronic properties (sheet resistance of similar to 1. 3 O per sq with an optical transmittance of similar to 90 %) and mechanical reliability (90 % stretchability). The optoelectronic properties can be controlled by adjusting the area fraction of the mNF networks, which also enables the modulation of the power consumption of the heater. For example, the low sheet resistance of the heater presents an outstanding power efficiency of 0. 65 W cm(- 2) (with the temperature reaching 250 degrees C at a low DC voltage of 4. 5 V), which is similar to 10 times better than the properties of conventional indium tin oxide-based heaters.

In total, 13 experimental cases were conducted by adjusting the heat generation of the <b>heating</b> <b>film,</b> the temperature and the airflow rate of supply air. The {{performance of}} stratum ventilation was evaluated by examining the distributions of temperature, velocity and dimensionless carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration, effective draft temperature for stratum ventilation (EDTS), predicted mean vote index (PMV), and efficiencies of heat and contaminant removals. The experimental results demonstrated that stratum ventilation performed well in heat removal and contaminant removal. Quality inhaled air for the occupants was provided in all experimental cases.

When the inner surface temperature of glass wall closed to 40 °C, the PMV values approached the upper bound of the comfort zone. For every case wherein the cooling load was 90 W/m 2 or below, and the supply air temperature was 19 ¿ 21 °C, thermal comfort of the occupants was provided. Both the efficiencies of heat removal and of local contaminant removal improved with increasing airflow rate at constant supply air temperature.

Here, an in situ curing technique for PMCs using a resistive <b>heating</b> <b>film</b> comprised of an aligned carbon nanotube (A-CNT) network is presented. A carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) prepreg system is effectively cured via a single-side CNT network heater incorporated on the outer surface of the laminate without using an autoclave. Evaluation of the curing efficacy shows that composites cured by A-CNT film heaters can achieve degrees of cure that are equivalent or better than composites cured by an autoclave. This manufacturing technique enables highly efficient curing of PMCs while adding multifunctionality to finished composites. United States.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJ. S. DrouillardA {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted in which wheat gluten film forming solutions were modified by various means to produce films that would improve resistance to ruminal degradation. There was an interaction between pH and temperature, whereby low pH (pH 3) and high temperature (75 °C) of film forming solution resulted in films that had highest resistance to microbial degradation. Strategies that proved unsuccessful in improving resistance to ruminal degradation included use of the cross-linking enzyme, transglutaminase; induction of a Maillard reaction; and increasing the time of <b>heating</b> <b>film</b> forming solutions. Utilizing HCl versus acetic acid as the means to lower the pH of the film forming solution resulted in poor film formation, which {{can be attributed to}} glutenin‟s solubility in acetic acid. When acetic acid was replaced with 25 % HCl, however, no compromise in film formation was observed and ruminal degradability was not affected. In order to develop an economical and effective means of encapsulating lysine for rumen bypass, wheat gluten and corn zein were evaluated as encapsulation materials. Coating soybean meal with either wheat gluten or zein resulted in superior protection against ruminal degradation when compared to unprotected soybean meal. Compared to wheat gluten, zein was observed to have greater resistance to ruminal degradation in vitro. Lysine was encapsulated by the spray dry method with wheat gluten or zein. Results from an in vitro ammonia release experiment were inconclusive with respect to effectiveness of the encapsulation process. Wheat gluten films were approximately 59 % degraded in pepsin solution. Our results suggest that 72 % of the wheat gluten film will bypass the rumen and 59 % of the bypass fraction of the film will be degraded in the abomasum.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{application of}} polymer matrix composites (PMCs) has encouraged {{the use of}} nanofibers, especially carbon nanotubes (CNTs), to concurrently enhance the physical properties of such composites while adding multi-functionality. However, current-generation manufacturing routes of PMCs have drawbacks including geometrical limitations and high energy utilization. Improvements to manufacturing processes are needed, and in this thesis the in situ curing of a PMC using a resistive <b>heating</b> <b>film</b> comprised of an aligned CNT network is developed, and the underlying physics that govern the electron transport properties of the aligned CNT network {{as a function of}} temperature and orientation are explored. Aligned CNT film heaters have anisotropic electrical properties and show negative coefficient of resistance with temperature. A carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) system is effectively cured by a single (top layer) CNT network heater. Evaluation of the curing efficacy (via degree of cure) shows that the in-plane spatial variation of the degree of cure directly correlates to maximum temperature during cure as evaluated with a thermal camera. Through-thickness spatial variation in degree of cure is found to be < 8 % for the one-sided curing heater. Future work will include characterization and modeling of the underlying physics that govern the performance of aligned CNT networks as resistive heaters, exploration of possible methods to scale-up the in situ curing process to laminates with sizes on the order of meters, and evaluation of the structure and properties of composites manufactured using the method reported here to elucidate any difference in composite performance when compared to materials synthesized using current-generation techniques. by Jeonyoon Lee.

30|$|Although {{temperature}} {{is a key}} parameter in electrospinning, the related reports are extremely limited, which is possibly correlated with the simple implementation of electrospinning under ambient conditions. The key in running elevated temperature electrospinning lies in heating and maintaining the working fluid at a constant temperature different from ambient conditions. Steven et al. [4] utilized a ceramic infrared emitter to manipulate solution temperature up to 110  °C during electrospinning. They declared that infrared flux on the polyethylene solution from the emitter can be precisely controlled by both the variable output controller and {{the distance between the}} emitter and the glass syringe. Wang et al. [16] reported a jacket-type heat exchanger that was exploited to control the temperature of solutions containing polyacrylonitrile (PAN) in dimethylformamide up to 88.7  °C. A circulation of heated silicone oil by a pumping system connected to an oil bath was utilized to adjust the working temperature. Considering the applications of an electric <b>heating</b> <b>film</b> and a temperature regulator, Yu et al. developed an auxiliary heating system to maintain a constant temperature of working fluids for preparing medicated nanofibers [17, 18] and drug-loaded composite microparticles [19]. Desai and Kit [20] conducted elevated temperature electrospinning to prepare beadless composite nanofibers consisting of chitosan and polyacrylamide. The working temperature of 70  °C was maintained through the circulation of hot air around the syringe and needle. Kin et al. [21] prepared cellulose nanofibers from its solutions in a mixture of N-methylmorpholine oxide and water through elevated temperature electrospinning but provided no detailed information on the heating unit. De Vrieze et al. [22] investigated the effects of temperature and humidity on electrospun cellulose acetate nanofibers. The working temperature was adjusted using a polymethylmethacrylate chamber to house the electrospinning system, and the whole setup was placed in a temperature-controlled room, with variations only from 273 to 303  K. These approaches (including infrared radiation, direct heating, indirect heating through flowing air/oil/water, or even storage in a constant temperature room) can be considered when implementing elevated temperature electrospinning over a range of working temperature.|$|E
