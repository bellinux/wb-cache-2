5|$|Although Del Piero {{was mostly}} on the substitutes' bench at Euro 2008, he started in Italy's second group match against Romania as the squad's captain. In the first group match against the Dutch, he came on for the under-performing Antonio Di Natale and made an {{immediate}} impact, including several efforts on goal; however, he could not prevent Italy from losing 3–0. Italy qualified through the group stage in second-place behind the Netherlands, eliminating Romania and France. In the quarter-final against eventual champions Spain, Del Piero made a substitute appearance during extra-time, and with the game ending in a 0–0 <b>draw,</b> <b>it</b> was decided by a penalty shootout in which Spain won 4–2.|$|E

Granderson wrote a children's book, All You Can Be: Dream It, <b>Draw</b> <b>It,</b> Become It!, {{which was published in}} August 2009. The book is illustrated by students of the New York City public school system. In February 2010, Granderson represented MLB at a White House function announcing Let's Move!, a childhood anti-obesity effort sponsored by First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama. Granderson donated $5 million to help UIC build a new baseball stadium in 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the character's various television and film appearances, Quatermass was also seen {{in a variety of}} other media between the 1950s and the 1990s. In 1955 Kneale was invited by the publishers of the Daily Express to write a new prose Quatermass story for serialisation in their newspaper; as he was unable to think of a new storyline, they suggested he simply adapt Quatermass II, which he agreed to do. The serialisation ran in the Daily Express from 5 December 1955 to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to <b>draw</b> <b>it</b> to a rapid conclusion when the paper lost interest in the project and instructed him to complete the story as soon as possible.|$|E
25|$|An ancient Roman car or chariot {{drawn by}} four horses abreast {{together}} with the horses <b>drawing</b> <b>it</b> was called a Quadriga, from the Latin quadriugi (of a team of four). The term sometimes meant instead the four horses without the chariot or the chariot alone. A three-horse chariot, or the three-horse team <b>drawing</b> <b>it,</b> was a triga, from triugi (of a team of three). A two-horse chariot, or the two-horse team <b>drawing</b> <b>it,</b> was a biga, from biugi.|$|R

5|$|The {{advance of}} the 18th RCT cleared away the last {{remnants}} of the force defending the E-1 draw. When engineers cut a road up {{the western side of}} this <b>draw,</b> <b>it</b> became the main route inland off the beaches. With the congestion on the beaches thus relieved, they were re-opened for the landing of vehicles by 14:00. Further congestion on this route, caused by continued resistance just inland at St. Laurent, was bypassed with a new route, and at 17:00, the surviving tanks of the 741st tank battalion were ordered inland via the E-1 draw.|$|E
5|$|Gaara's initial attire, {{along with}} the costumes of his siblings, was {{difficult}} for Kishimoto to draw on a weekly basis. Because of this, Kishimoto gave {{the three of them}} simpler costumes towards the end of Part I; Gaara received an outfit with an upright collar. In addition to being easier to <b>draw,</b> <b>it</b> was used to demonstrate the change in relationship between Gaara and Naruto following their previous fight. Kishimoto cites The Matrix, one of his favorite movies, as an inspiration for Gaara's new costume, and he considers it to be his favorite costume of the three siblings. For Part II, there was a scene where an antagonist Deidara was sitting on Gaara's body. This shot was inspired by Akira, a manga by Katsuhiro Otomo that Kishimoto was a fan of.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications {{in the jaw}} musculature which {{make it possible for}} them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This is of great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and <b>draw</b> <b>it</b> into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food. Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin.|$|E
