5|$|Mercedes {{is shocked}} {{when the driver}} of the car gets out and is {{revealed}} as Doctor Browning, who has escaped from prison. He holds Mercedes hostage and forces her into the car, driving off and leaving Clare's corpse in the road. He takes her to the empty McQueen house and attempts to kill her, but Cindy and Lindsey arrive in time and knock him unconscious. Doctor Browning awakens and attempts to attack the women so Mercedes strikes Doctor Browning over the head with a shovel, killing him. The three women panic and put Doctor Browning's corpse into bin liners, stashing it in the attic of the McQueen home. When they discover that the attic <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> new insulation a few weeks later, the three women scramble to dispose of the corpse and enlist the help of Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) to hide the body. Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey place Doctor Browning's body in his car and push it off a cliff, making it appear that Doctor Browning had committed suicide after escaping prison. Cindy panics and alerts the police to the car crash scene. Police officer Sam Lomax (Lizzie Roper) discovers that Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey were involved in Doctor Browning's murder and brings them in for questioning. When they all confess, she releases them, explaining that she has had to make some decisions to get rid of bad people, and the three women are set free, and Sam disposes of the evidence.|$|E
5|$|Torajans perform dances {{on several}} occasions, most often during their {{elaborate}} funeral ceremonies. They dance {{to express their}} grief, and to honour and even cheer the deceased person because he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a long journey in the afterlife. First, {{a group of men}} form a circle and sing a monotonous chant throughout the night to honour the deceased (a ritual called Ma'badong). This is considered by many Torajans {{to be the most important}} component of the funeral ceremony. On the second funeral day, the Ma'randing warrior dance is performed to praise the courage of the deceased during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made from buffalo skin, a helmet with a buffalo horn, and other ornamentation. The Ma'randing dance precedes a procession in which the deceased is carried from a rice barn to the rante, the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the Ma'katia dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The Ma'akatia dance is performed to remind the audience of the generosity and loyalty of the deceased person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called Ma'dondan.|$|E

25|$|Stanley later {{questions}} Blanche {{about her}} earlier marriage. Blanche had married {{when she was}} very young, but her husband died, leaving her widowed and alone. The memory of her dead husband causes Blanche some obvious distress. Stanley, worried {{that he has been}} cheated out of an inheritance, demands to know what happened to Belle Reve, once a large plantation and the DuBois family home. Blanche hands over all the documents pertaining to Belle Reve. While looking at the papers, Stanley notices a bundle of letters that Blanche emotionally proclaims are personal love letters from her dead husband.

[...] Bowyer did not lose the victory title for the race itself; NASCAR vice president of competition Robin Pemberton commented, [...] "We don't consider taking away the win.

500|$|Paul Mazursky's 1982 modern-language {{adaptation}} of The Tempest, with Philip Dimitrius (Prospero) as a disillusioned New York architect who retreats to a lonely Greek island {{with his daughter}} Miranda after learning of his wife Antonia's infidelity with Alonzo, dealt frankly with the sexual tensions of the characters' isolated existence. The Caliban character, the goatherd Kalibanos, asks Philip which of them <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex with Miranda. John Cassavetes played Philip, Raul Julia Kalibanos, Gena Rowlands Antonia and Molly Ringwald Miranda. Susan Sarandon plays the Ariel character, Philip's frequently bored girlfriend Aretha.

Daniel Martin gave the episode a positive review on The Guardian guardian.co.uk, {{saying that it}} [...] "can lay credible claim to being the greatest episode of Doctor Who there has ever been". He went on to declare: [...] "It's just ridiculously good— so much that there's scarcely any point in picking out moments because there was an iconic sequence every couple of seconds." [...] In particular he praised Father Octavian's death scene, noting how [...] "despair creeps over Matt Smith's face as he realises he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to leave him to die; Octavian's final speech weeps with honour and elegance".

This leads to a hysterical, yet truly gross, scene where Peter knocks over an entire shelf of sperm samples, and has to refill them, um, himself." [...] Geoffrey D. Roberts of Real Talk Reviews {{reviewed}} the episode negatively, writing [...] "many viewers will probably be disappointed with an episode about sibling rivalry between Stewie and newfound half-brother Bertram. Both share the same goal– to rule the Universe. With Bertram nothing more than a whinier version of his half-brother, it turns out one Stewie Griffin is more than enough." ...|$|E

[...] Sarah's storyline also explores her moral culpability following Andrew's suicide. Personal accountability is a central theme of the novel, with Elkins of The New York Times opining that by not focusing on [...] "postcolonial guilt or African angst", Cleave is able to use the novel to challenge readers' conceptions of civility and ethical choice. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly feels that the book delivered a message of anti-complacency, however believes that is does so by [...] "bemoaning the normality of the First World in the face of the horrors of the Third."

Kroll declared that [...] "We don't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can't make those elements work, it's a sad day." [...] The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy—as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, [...] "You have this movie which <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a pretty big built in fanbase... but you also have a movie that you are trying to keep very secret. Chris [...] really likes people to see his movies in a theater and not see it all beforehand so everything that you do to market that—at least early on—is with an eye to feeding the interest to fans." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{explain how}} to break free of the prison and its institutions, Satin {{develops}} a [...] "psychocultural" [...] class analysis that reveals the existence of [...] "life-", [...] "thing-", and [...] "death-oriented" [...] classes. [...] According to Satin, life-oriented individuals constitute an emerging [...] "third force" [...] in post-industrial nations. [...] The third force is generating a [...] "prison-free" [...] consciousness consisting of androgynous attitudes, spirituality, multiple perspectives, a cooperative mentality, local-and-global identities, and an ecological outlook. [...] To transform prison society, Satin argues, the third force <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to launch an [...] "evolutionary movement" [...] to replace– or at least supplement– monolithic institutions with life-affirming, [...] "biolithic" [...] ones. [...] Some representative biolithic institutions are: deliberative democracy {{as an alternative to}} bureaucratic government, bicycles and mass transit {{as an alternative to the}} private automobile, and mediation as an alternative to attorney-centered law. [...] According to Satin, the third force will not have to overthrow capitalism, since Western civilization– not capitalism– is said to be responsible for the prison. [...] But the third force will want to foster a prison-free New Age capitalism through intelligent regulation and elimination of all subsidies.|$|E
