5|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim find their living styles are {{increasingly}} clashing. Jim is slovenly, leaving dirty <b>dishes</b> to soak <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> until someone else washes them, while Darryl is so fastidious about his possessions that he puts labels {{with his name}} on all of them, even a bag of flour. When Darryl takes issue with Jim using his labeled coffee mug, the two begin bickering. Eventually the two come to understand each other's habits better, and relieve tension by playing a video game together.|$|R

50|$|It {{is a short}} respite. The kitchen faucet begins {{dripping}} {{and seemingly}} with {{a mind of its}} own, it even makes melodies as it drips. Frustrated, Donald leaps out of bed and turns it off tightly and heads back to bed - bleary eyed - but he is soon disrupted once again. The dripping faucet plays more melodies with a pile of <b>dishes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> and then becomes magnified in Donald's delirious mind, first appearing as giant, booming drops of water falling from a great height into a much deeper sink. The drops turn into falling bombs with an even deeper louder sound, shaking Donald violently as he rolls up inside his mattress to try to escape the sound. His whole house then begins shaking off its foundations with each drop. Soon the whole earth is affected and shakes with each drop as the incessant drops are increasingly magnified in Donald's sleep-deprived mind.|$|E

40|$|When using existential constructions to {{introduce}} plural NPs (e. g., there are <b>dishes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink),</b> speakers {{have the option}} of using a plural or singular form of the verb. In other words, speakers can use agreeing (plural) or non-agreeing (singular) forms of the verb when the NP is plural. Previous research reveals that non-agreement under existential there is the norm, even in standard varieties of spoken English. Speakers use non-agreeing forms, such as there’s or there is, in roughly two-thirds of all tokens with plural NPs. This is striking, because other forms of non-agreement are relatively uncommon in standard varieties of spoken English. There is mounting evidence, though, that the two present tense non-agreeing forms there is + NPpl and there’s + NPpl are neither syntactically nor sociolinguistically equivalent. While the full verb non-agreeing form there is NPpl seems to be socially distributed like a stable, stigmatized variant, the cliticized non-agreeing form there’s + NPpl appears to be widespread and relatively free of social stigma. In this paper, I investigate whether there’s + NPpl and there is + NPpl constitute distinct sociolinguistic variants by testing how listeners socially evaluate the speakers who use them. The results of this perception study demonstrate that there’s + NPpl is much less socially stigmatized than there is + NPpl, and it is almost identical to the standard agreeing form there are + NPpl in how it influences social perceptions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to decrease the}} amount of days that the participant went without washing her dishes. The participant would let her dishes pile up for days leading to unsanitary situations. For example, the participant would not soak her <b>dishes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> {{when she was done}} eating or cooking she would simply just set it on the counter. This would lead to whatever leftover food that was left on the plate to be caked on and take a long amount of time to wash off. Therefore, the study used ABAC design to help {{to reduce the number of}} days that the participant would let her dishes pile up for. After observing the behavior of the participant and realizing that this was a behavior that needed to be changed, the researcher made the behavior apparent to the participant and she volunteered herself for the study. Through the use of two different interventions, in an attempt to reach the goal of only having the duration of one day of letting her dishes pile up. The two different interventions included a stimulus intervention, which included having pictures of what her kitchen looked like when it was clean up on the cupboards. The second intervention included the pictures as well as verbal prompting to ensure that the behavior was to be performed. The outcome of the study showed that the participant was able to reduce the duration of the amount of days between washing dishes...|$|E
