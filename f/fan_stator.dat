2500|$|In July 2014 {{there was}} an {{uncontained}} failure [...] of a fan rotor while the aircraft was preparing for take-off. The parts passed through a fuel tank and caused a fire, grounding the F-35 fleet. During high g-force maneuvering three weeks before flight, there was excessive rubbing at the seal between the fan blisk and the <b>fan</b> <b>stator</b> causing the failure. The engine [...] "flex" [...] generated a temperature of over 1,000°C (1,900°F) in materials designed to fail at 540°C (1,000°F). Micro cracks appeared in third-stage fan blades, according to program manager Christopher Bogdan, causing blades to separate from the disk. The failed blades punctured the fuel cell and hot air mixing with jet fuel caused the fire. As a short term fix, each aircraft is flown on a specific flight profile to allow the rotor seal to wear a mating groove in the stator to prevent excessive rubbing.|$|E

40|$|Four <b>fan</b> <b>stator</b> {{blades and}} three {{compressor}} rotor blades belonging to an aeroengine {{were sent to}} this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that all the four <b>fan</b> <b>stator</b> blades were in tact, while the rotor blades were severely damaged. The damages were {{in the form of}} loss of material by fracture and bending/curling. Study showed that the damages were caused due to impact of the blades with solid hard objects. From the shape and pattern of the damages, it was established that the foreign object was circular in cross section and it had threads on the surface. The damage pattern on the blades was found to have close resemblance to the threads on the screw (made of steel) that was provided for establishing the possible foreign object type. Analysis of the damaged regions on the rotor blades showed presence of elements such as iron in concentration as high as 29 wt%. Based on these laboratory findings, it is stated that the foreign object is similar to the screw that was provided for establishing the foreign object type...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} (i) {{guidelines for}} propulsor sizing, and (ii) strategies for fan turbomachinery conceptual design, for a boundary layer ingesting (BLI) propulsion system for advanced civil transport aircraft. For the former, configuration performance analysis shows BLI yields {{a reduction in}} mechanical power required to propel a given aircraft. For the latter, fan turbomachinery design attributes are identified to mitigate the impact of BLI inlet distortion on propulsor performance. The propulsion system requirements are determined using a mechanical energy analysis, in which {{the performance of the}} airframe and propulsor are characterized in terms of sources and sinks of power. Using this framework, the propulsor can be sized based on the performance of the isolated airframe. Analysis of the power savings due to BLI (from reduction of viscous dissipation both in the aircraft wake and the propulsor jet) leads to scaling choices for the sizing of propulsor simulators for wind tunnel experiments to assess BLI benefit. Fan stage distortion response is assessed computationally for a range of turbomachinery design parameters and for distortions characteristic of BLI. The numerical results show the importance of three-dimensional flow redistribution upstream of the fan, and indicate that, for the parameters examined, non-axisymmetric <b>fan</b> <b>stators</b> have the largest effect on decreasing blade row velocity distortions and thus mitigating losses due to flow non-uniformity. by David Kenneth Hall.

The proof was to determine whether bearing faults and fan imbalances could be detected in vane-axial fans using Motor Electrical Signature Analysis (MESA).

The measured midspan loss of total pressure can be related to stator surface boundary layers, the chopped rotor wakes passing through the stator row, and the interaction between these flows. The interaction between rotor blade wake segments and stator blade surface boundary layers generates much higher losses than expected in both the stator wake and in the region of flow between stator boundary layers/wakes, if interaction effects are ignored...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to demonstrate the cost and weight advantages that could be obtained by utilizing the graphite/PMR 15 material system to replace titanium in selected turbofan engine applications. The first component to be selected {{as a basis for}} evaluation was the outer bypass duct of the General Electric F 404 engine. The operating environment of this duct was defined and then an extensive mechanical and physical property test program was conducted using material made by processing techniques which were also established by this program. Based on these properties, design concepts to fabricate a composite version of the duct were established and two complete ducts fabricated. One of these ducts was proof pressure tested and then run successfully on a factory test engine for over 1900 hours. The second duct was static tested to 210 percent design limit load without failure. An improved design was then developed which utilized integral composite end flanges. A complete duct was fabricated and successfully proof pressure tested. The net results of this effort showed that a composite version of the outer duct would be 14 percent lighter and 30 percent less expensive that the titanium duct. The other type of structure chosen for investigation was the F 404 <b>fan</b> <b>stator</b> assembly, including the <b>fan</b> <b>stator</b> vanes. It was concluded that it was feasible to utilize composite materials for this type structure but that the requirements imposed by replacing an existing metal design resulted in an inefficient composite design. It was concluded that if composites were to be effectively used in this type structure, the design must be tailored for composite application from the outset...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNoise {{reduction}} by active {{noise control}} in jet engines and its prediction is of high interest, since the acoustic goals of flightpath 2050 can hardly be achieved by passive acoustic treatments. Numerous former test campaigns showed that significant noise reduction is possible by {{active noise control}}. Simulations are needed for further understanding of test results {{and in order to}} predict the noise reduction and possibly impact on the performance of future jet engines. Therefore an ANC prediction tool in frequency domain based on a common 3 D CAA solver has been developed. The tool is validated by measurements in a simple straight duct with wall mounted sensors and loudspeakers. The primary sound field has one dominant azimuthal mode order. Varying complexity of the control concept leads to significant distinct results in noise reduction and the input signals of control sources. Later application of the tool will be the simulation of jet engines (i. e. inlet, <b>fan,</b> <b>stator</b> and nozzle). The CAA solver does not include the rotation of fan. Established models of fan scattering and sound transmission need to be implemented.

40|$|Abstract − In {{order to}} provide a low cost system of thermal comfort, a common model of home fan, 40 cm {{diameter}} size, had its manual four-button control system replaced by an automatic speed control.

Over {{a wide range of}} velocity, the fan net power and the motor fan input power were measured working under both control system. The temperature of the motor stator and the voltage waveforms were observed too. Measured values analysis showed that the TRIAC-based control system makes the fan motor work at a very low power factor and efficiency values. The worst case is at low velocity range where the higher <b>fan</b> motor <b>stator</b> temperatures were registered.

The code {{is a combination}} of subroutines from two NASA programs with many new features added by Pratt & Whitney. To do a calculation V 072 first uses a semi-empirical wake prediction to calculate the rotor wake characteristics at the stator leading edge. Results from the wake model are then automatically input into a rotor wake/stator interaction analytical noise prediction routine which calculates inlet aft sound power levels for the blade-passage-frequency tones and their harmonics, along with the complex radial mode amplitudes.

50|$|Austrian Anselm Franz of Junkers engine {{division}} (Junkers Motoren or Jumo) addressed {{these problems}} {{with the introduction of}} the axial-flow compressor. Essentially, this is a turbine in reverse. Air coming {{in the front of the}} engine is blown towards the rear of the engine by a fan stage (convergent ducts), where it is crushed against a set of non-rotating blades called stators (divergent ducts). The process is nowhere near as powerful as the centrifugal compressor, so a number of these pairs of <b>fans</b> and <b>stators</b> are placed in series to get the needed compression. Even with all the added complexity, the resulting engine is much smaller in diameter and thus, more aerodynamic. Jumo was assigned the next engine number in the RLM numbering sequence, 4, and the result was the Jumo 004 engine. After many lesser technical difficulties were solved, mass production of this engine started in 1944 as a powerplant for the worlds first jet-fighter aircraft, the Messerschmitt Me 262 (and later the worlds first jet-bomber aircraft, the Arado Ar 234). A variety of reasons conspired to delay the engines availability, this delay caused the fighter to arrive too late to decisively impact Germanys position in World War II. Nonetheless, it will be remembered as the first use of jet engines in service.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to assess the potential of Passive Porosity Technology as a mechanism to reduce interaction noise in turbomachinery by reducing the fluctuating forces acting on the vane surfaces. To do so, a typical <b>fan</b> <b>stator</b> airfoil was subjected to the effects of a transversely moving wake; time histories of the primitive aerodynamic variables, obtained from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions, were then input into an acoustic prediction code. This procedure was performed on the solid airfoil to obtain a baseline, and on a series of porous configurations in order to isolate those that yield maximum noise reductions without compromising the aerodynamic performance of the stator. It was found that communication between regions of high pressure differential - made possible by the use of passive porosity - is necessary to significantly alter the noise radiation pattern of the stator airfoil. In general, noise reductions were obtained for those configurations incorporating passive porosity in the region between x/c ~ 0. 15 on the suction side of the airfoil and x/c ~ 0. 20 on the pressure side. Reductions in overall radiated noise of approximately 1. 0 dB were obtained. The noise benefit increased to about 2. 5 dB when the effects of loading noise alone were considered...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} incorporation of a twin-stream fan into the CIRSTEL tail boom. The Combined Infra-Red Suppression and Tail rotor Elimination (CIRSTEL) tail boom is a system designed to replace the tail rotor on a conventional helicopter. It relies on the Coanda effect to create circulation around the helicopter tail boom when exposed to the rotor downwash. This generates sideways-directed lift to counter the main rotor torque, and a tail thruster adds extra torque and directional control. A twin-stream fan supplies separate air streams {{to each of the}} Coanda and tail thruster sections. The first section of the study {{describes the}} experimental tests done on an 83 % scale demonstrator of the twin-stream fan with the objective to verify the concept and determine the fan section efficiencies. Subsequent modifications done to the <b>fan</b> <b>stator</b> blades are also evaluated. The efficiencies of the design were shown to exceed the targets in both sections. The section concludes with design recommendations for a future fan, based on the findings of the experiments. A brief analysis of the CIRSTEL system is presented and by using optimisation techniques the predicted power demand of the system could be significantly reduced from a conventional tail rotor. The second section of the study details the conceptual design and CFD evaluation of air intakes for the fan that can be fitted to the helicopter. The objective here was to study the flow affecting helicopter intakes as well as to establish design considerations for a fan intake. A basic intake concept was developed for the Alouette III/CIRSTEL combination and modified according to results based on the CFD simulations. The intake design was evolved to the point were it was shown that the concept is feasible. These CFD simulations were an initial effort to design the fan intakes {{with the help of a}} simplified rotor flow field. The investigation was subsequently extended to investigate helicopter intake design considerations in the presence of a representative rotor, which was modelled as an actuator disk in the CFD simulations. In this investigation top and side mounted intake concepts were compared and analysed for suitability as a fan intake. Each intake concept showed its own advantages. Due to the proximity of the rotor hub to the intake, distortion and total pressure levels at the fan face are influenced negatively. The report is concluded with design recommendations for the intake as applied to the current Alouette III configuration, as well as for implementation on helicopters in general...|$|E

The sound pressure can then be cast as the sum of {{a finite number of}} discrete sound waves (modes) the magnitude of which depends on an unknown function satisfying a singular integral equation. Similarity rules are derived to reduce the problem to that of a two-dimensional gust. Three-dimensional effects on the cut-off condition, the sound pressure, and the acoustic power are first investigated for each mode.

40|$|Hydro-generators {{are complex}} {{machines}} used {{to convert the}} mechanical energy of the water turbine into electrical energy. Electromagnetic and mechanical losses accompany this energy conversion process which will cause heat generation and temperature increase. Cooling systems are needed to remove this excess heat from hydro-generators. Cooling system should control temperature increase and its temporal and spatial uniformity. An efficient cooling and ventilation must be considered during the electro-mechanical design of a generator. Having a complete picture of the losses, the ventilation flow field characteristics and the temperatures inside a generator is essential for an optimal design of cooling system for it. The present work provides experimental and numerical tools essential for investigating ventilation flow attributes inside hydro-generators and also a comprehensive studies of flow based on these tools. An extensive knowledge of flow distribution inside the stator ventilation channels in different operational conditions and geometrical configurations are achieved. The obtained knowledge {{can be used for}} improvement in design of generator cooling system.   A hydro-generator model was designed and manufactured taking into consideration the needs of both the experimental and numerical methodologies. An inlet section is designed to deliver a uniform flow distribution into the machine and also to facilitate a direct and accurate measurement of the inlet flow rate. A CFD-based procedure is utilized for its design. The intake flow can either be supplied by a specifically designed radial fan connected to the rotor and co-rotating with that, or by an external centrifugal <b>fan.</b> <b>Stators</b> with three different ventilation channel geometrical configurations are used. Total pressure rake, 5 -hole probe and hot-wire anemometer are used for taking measurements at stator ventilation channels outlets and generator inlet. Particle image velocimetry is carried out to reveal the flow field inside the ventilation channels.   The computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed using the FOAM-extend CFD toolbox. A block-structured mesh is generated using the ANSYS ICEM CFD mesh generator. The steady-state multiple frames of reference method is used for the numerical simulations. The frozen rotor and mixing plane approaches are used to handle the rotor-stator interaction. The flow is assumed axisymmetric, so just a section of generator model is simulated numerically. Periodic boundary conditions are imposed at {{the two sides of the}} computational section. Turbulences in the flow are modeled with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) formulation. The flow and pressure field in the generator model are analyzed in detail. The numerical and experimental results show a good agreement, which indicates the applicability of both methods. Another aspect of hydro-generator ventilation which is important for designers is the convective heat transfer coefficients. An alternative way to indirectly obtain the convective heat transfer coefficients is to conduct mass transfer experiments such as the naphthalene sublimation technique. In the present work this technique is evaluated for analysis of the local heat transfer distribution when a circular air jet impinges normal on a flat surface. The local sublimation rate from the naphthalene surface subjected to the air jet is measured and reduced to the heat transfer that would occur on the surface under analogous thermal conditions. The indirectly obtained local heat transfer distributions and its local Nusselt numbers are compared to the results of numerical simulations and other experiments. The results show that the naphthalene sublimation technique can be used to accurately estimate the local heat transfer coefficients...|$|R

Highlights are included from the Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) Noise Reduction Program and the Quiet Aircraft Technology (QAT) project {{with emphasis on}} engine source noise reduction. Noise reduction goals for 10 EPNdB by 207 and 20 EPNdB by 2022 are reviewed. Fan and jet noise technologies are highlighted from the AST program including higher bypass ratio propulsion, scarf inlets, forward-swept <b>fans,</b> swept/leaned <b>stators,</b> chevron nozzles, noise prediction methods, and active noise control for fans. Source diagnostic tests for fans and jets that have been completed {{over the past few}} years are presented showing how new flow measurement methods such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) have played a key role in understanding turbulence, the noise generation process, and how to improve noise prediction methods. Tests focused on source decomposition have helped identify which engine components need further noise reduction. The role of Computational AeroAcoustics (CAA) for fan noise prediction is presented. Advanced noise reduction methods such as Hershel-Quincke tubes and trailing edge blowing for fan noise that are currently being pursued n the QAT program are also presented. Highlights are shown form engine validation and flight demonstrations that were done in the late 1990 's with Pratt & Whitney on their PW 4098 engine and Honeywell on their TFE- 731 - 60 engine.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of the subject test were to identify and quantify the mechanisms by which fan broadband noise is produced, and to assess the validity of such theoretical models of those mechanisms as may be available. The test was conducted with the Boeing 18 -inch fan rig in the Boeing Low-Speed Aeroacoustic Facility (LSAF). The rig {{was designed to be}} particularly clean and geometrically simple to facilitate theoretical modeling and to minimize sources of interfering noise. The inlet is cylindrical and is equipped with a boundary layer suction system. The fan is typical of modern high-by-pass ratio designs but is capable of operating with or without fan exit guide vanes (stators), and there is only a single flow stream. Fan loading and tip clearance are adjustable. Instrumentation included measurements of fan performance, the unsteady flow field incident on the <b>fan</b> and <b>stators,</b> and far-field and in-duct acoustic fields. The acoustic results were manipulated to estimate the noise generated by different sources. Significant fan broadband noise was found to come from the rotor self-noise as measured with clean inflow and no boundary layer. The rotor tip clearance affected rotor self-noise somewhat. The interaction of the rotor with inlet boundary layer turbulence is also a significant source, and is strongly affected by rotor tip clearance. High level noise can be generated by a high-order nonuniform rotating {{at a fraction of the}} fan speed, at least when tip clearance and loading are both large. Stator-generated noise is the loudest of the significant sources, by a small margin, at least on this rig. Stator noise is significantly affected by propagation through the fan...|$|R

40|$|This article {{experimentally}} and numerically {{investigates the}} thermal {{performance of a}} 2350 -kW completely enclosed motor, which is cooled through an air-to-air heat exchanger. The air in the heat exchanger includes external and internal flow paths. The external air driven by {{the rotation of the}} centrifugal fan goes through the heat exchanger mounted {{on the top of the}} frame. The internal air absorbs heat released from the stator and the rotor and then transfers the heat to the heat exchanger through the motion of two axial fans and the rotor. Several test rigs have been set up to measure the performance of the fan and the motor. The Fluent software package is adopted to analyze the complicated thermal-fluid interactions among the centrifugal fan, two axial <b>fans,</b> heat exchanger, <b>stator,</b> and rotor. The measured data, including the fan performance curves and the temperature profiles of the heat exchanger and the stator, show good agreement with the simulated results.

40|$|As a novel aero-engine concept, {{adaptive}} cycle aero-engines (ACEs) are attracting wide {{attention in}} the international aviation industry due to their potential superior task adaptability along a wide flight regime. However, this superior task adaptability can only be demonstrated through proper combined engine control schedule design.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the air flow through the fan stage of a high-bypass, geared turbofan in windmilling conditions is proposed, to address the key performance issues of this severe case of off-design operation. Experiments are conducted in the turbofan test rig of ISAE, specifically suited to reproduce windmilling operation in an ambient ground setup. The engine is equipped with conventional measurements and radial profiles of flow quantities are measured using directional five-hole probes to characterize the flow across the fan stage and derive windmilling performance parameters. These results bring experimental evidence {{of the findings of}} the literature that both the <b>fan</b> rotor and <b>stator</b> operate under severe off-design angle-of-attack, leading to flow separation and stagnation pressure loss. The fan rotor operates in a mixed fashion: spanwise, the inner sections of the rotor blades add work to the flow while the outer sections extract work and generate a pressure loss. The overall work is negative, revealing the resistive loads on the fan, caused by the bearing friction and work exchange in the different components of the fan shaft. The parametric study shows that the fan rotational speed is proportional to the mass flow rate, but the fan rotor inlet and outlet relative flow angles, as well as the fan load profile, remain constant, for different values of mass flow rate. Estimations of engine bypass ratio have been done, yielding values higher than six times the design value. The comprehensive database that was built will allow the validation of 3 D Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations to provide {{a better understanding of the}} internal losses in windmilling conditions...|$|R

Some numerical investigations by Williams, Cho and Dalton, have suggested that a duct around a propeller makes it more unstable. This needs to be further investigated. In order to design an engine to safely perform a set of desired tasks, accurate information of the stresses on the blade during the entire cycle of blade motion is required. This requirement in turn demands that accurate knowledge of steady and unsteady blade loading be available. Aerodynamic solvers based on unsteady three-dimensional analysis will provide accurate and fast solutions and are best suited for aeroelastic analysis. The Euler solvers capture significant physics of the flowfield and are reasonably fast. An aerodynamic solver Ref. based on Euler equations had been developed under a separate grant from NASA Lewis in the past. Under the current grant, this solver has been modified to calculate the aeroelastic characteristics of unducted and ducted rotors. Even though, the aeroelastic solver based on three-dimensional Euler equations is computationally efficient, it is still very expensive to investigate the effects of multiple stages on the aeroelastic characteristics. In order to investigate the effects of multiple stages, a two-dimensional multi stage aeroelastic solver was also developed under this task, in collaboration with Dr. T. S. R. Reddy of the University of Toledo. Both of these solvers were applied to several test cases and validated against experimental data, where available...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the uncharted inlet and nacelle design space for low pressure ratio fans for advanced aeroengines. A key feature in low fan pressure ratio (FPR) propulsors with short inlets and nacelles is the increased coupling between fan and inlet. The thesis presents an integrated fan-nacelle design framework, combining a spline-based {{tool for the}} denition of inlet and nacelle surfaces with a fast and reliable body-force-based approach for the <b>fan</b> rotor and <b>stator</b> blade rows. The new capability captures the inlet-fan and fan-exhaust interactions and the ow distortion at the fan face and enables the parametric exploration of the short-inlet design territory. The interaction of the rotor with a region of high streamwise Mach number at the fan face is identied as the key aerodynamic mechanism limiting the design of short inlets. The local increase in streamwise Mach number is due to ow acceleration along the inlet internal surface coupled with a reduction in eective ow area. For a candidate short-inlet design with inlet length to fan diameter ratio L=D = 0 : 19, the streamwise Mach number at the fan face near the shroud increases by up to 0 : 16 at cruise and by up to 0 : 36 at o-design conditions relative to a long-inlet baseline propulsor with L=D = 0 : 5. As a consequence, the rotor locally operates close to choke, resulting in fan eciency penalties of up to 1 : 6 % at cruise and 3 : 9 % at o-design. For inlets with L=D < 0 : 25, the benet from reduced nacelle drag is offset by the reduction in fan eciency, resulting in propulsive eciency penalties. Based on a parametric inlet study, the recommended inlet L=D for engine propulsive eciency benefits is suggested to be between 0 : 25 and 0 : 4. A candidate design with L=D = 0 : 25 maintains the cruise propulsive efficiency of the baseline case without jeopardizing fan and LPC stability at o-design conditions. On the aircraft system level, fuel burn benefits are conjectured to be feasible due to the reductions in nacelle weight and drag compared to an aircraft powered by the long-inlet baseline propulsor. by Andreas Peters.
