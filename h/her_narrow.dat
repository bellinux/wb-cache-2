5|$|Van der Weyden was preoccupied by {{commissioned}} portraiture {{towards the}} end of his life and was highly regarded by later generations of painters for his penetrating evocations of character. In this work, the woman's humility and reserved demeanour are conveyed through her fragile physique, lowered eyes and tightly grasped fingers. She is slender and depicted according to the Gothic ideal of elongated features, indicated by <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> shoulders, tightly pinned hair, high forehead and the elaborate frame set by the headdress. It is the only known portrait of a woman accepted as an autograph work by van der Weyden, yet the sitter's name is not recorded and he did not title the work.|$|E

25|$|After <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> escape Aguila did {{not call}} at Tenerife, but instead went south to Freetown in Sierra Leone. There the UK formed inbound convoys to the British Isles, but if Aguila hoped to join one she was unsuccessful. From Freetown she turned north and steamed unescorted to Madeira, where she stopped for five days before {{continuing}} to Gibraltar. There she joined Convoy HG 43, which left on 4 September and reached Liverpool on 19 September.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fact that}} the people from South Park choose a young woman to be sacrificed every year, {{as well as the}} final scenes in which Britney is chased and then {{surrounded}} by people who take photographs of <b>her,</b> <b>narrowing</b> <b>her</b> space, and her trying to flee until she falls and dies, are directly inspired by The Rite of Spring, a ballet from 1913 by Igor Stravinsky.|$|R
25|$|In Anna's own memoirs, she {{describes}} her perils {{in prison and}} <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> escape from execution when, miraculously, she met several old friends of her father on a St. Petersburg street who helped her escape. She endured much hardship avoiding the Bolsheviks, {{and she was able}} to escape to Finland only in December 1920. Before leaving the Soviet Union, she became friends with the revolutionary writer Maxim Gorky, who urged her to write her memoirs; she followed his advice. She met with Zinaida Gippius, Alexander Blok and Valery Bryusov. Her memories of life at court provided rare descriptions of the home life of the Tsar and his family. No one understood Rasputin and Alexandra better than Anna did. She tells a good story but does not seem to tell the truth.|$|E
2500|$|In the games, Elexis is nemesis of {{the player}} character, the private {{security}} force HARDCORPS commander Colonel John R. Blade, and they are both based in Freeport City, a [...] "near-future mixture of San Francisco, Tokyo and New York." [...] After <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> escape {{at the end of}} SiN, she is missing in the 1999's expansion pack [...] but returns in SiN Episodes, of which just the episode Emergence was released in 2006 before the series' developer Ritual Entertainment ceased to exist in 2007. Ritual's community relations manager, Steve Hessel, said [...] "the resequencing process that put her DNA back together made her a bit younger, but mentally she's still her brilliant and scheming old self." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kindred ’s {{story is}} further {{fragmented}} by Dana’s report {{of her time}} traveling, which uses flashbacks to connect the present to the past. Robert Crossley sees this [...] "foreshortening" [...] {{of the past and}} present as a [...] "lesson in historical realities." [...] Because the story is told from the first-person point of view of Dana, readers feel they are witnessing firsthand the cruelty and hardships that many slaves faced every day in the South and so identify with Dana’s gut-wrenching reactions to the past. This autobiographical voice, along with Dana’s harrowing recollection of the brutality of slavery and <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> escape from it, {{is one of the key}} elements that have made critics classify Kindred as a neo-slave narrative.|$|E

50|$|On 1 April, {{the day of}} {{the initial}} assault on Okinawa, enemy air attacks came thick and fast. Ships of TG 58.1 smashed 12 enemy planes into the sea; Vincennes drew three assists in the action. At 13:21, the ship {{experienced}} <b>her</b> <b>narrowest</b> escape in the war; an enemy aircraft, hit by the ship's gunfire, crashed only 50 ft astern.|$|R

2500|$|In 1980, {{he sought}} a second term. In {{something}} of a surprise, his Republican opponent was Colorado Secretary of State Mary Estill Buchanan, a moderate candidate who narrowly defeated the more conservative choice, Howard [...] "Bo" [...] Callaway, in the party primary, by less than 2,000 primary votes. Fourteen years earlier, Callaway had been the Republican gubernatorial nominee in his native Georgia. Callaway in the early 1970s had bought and run an elegant resort in Crested Butte. Buchanan had hit Hart hard for supporting the Panama Canal Treaties and for backing then-President Jimmy Carter in 80% of his Senate votes. Buchanan charged in a campaign ad about Hart: [...] "He votes one way and talks another when he is back here. He is a liberal, McGovernite carpetbagger." [...] Hart responded that Buchanan's charges reflected <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> viewpoint and insisted that his campaign would rise above partisanship. Said Hart in a campaign ad: [...] "I will not ignore her. We will interact and debate, but I am going to run a campaign for the 1980s. What is her plan for the environment? For national defense? For the economy? It took me {{a year or so}} to formulate my ideas." [...] In the end, Hart won narrowly, with 50.2% of the vote to his opponent's 49.8%.|$|E

50|$|Munro {{was elected}} to the Ontario {{legislature}} in the 1995 provincial election, defeating incumbent New Democrat Larry O'Connor in the former Durham—York riding. She was re-elected in the redistributed riding of York North in the 1999 election. The Tories lost the 2003 general election, but Munro was able to retain her seat by a reduced margin. She has been re-elected in 2007, 2011 and again in 2014, albeit by <b>her</b> <b>narrowest</b> margin, in the riding of York-Simcoe.|$|R
50|$|While {{the statewide}} {{elections}} for governor and lieutenant governor garnered more national attention, {{the race for}} attorney general was the most competitive. Obenshain had an election night lead of 1,200 votes. In the following days, as provisional ballots were counted, <b>Herring</b> <b>narrowed</b> the lead and ultimately overtook him. On November 25, the Virginia State Board of Elections certified the results and Herring was declared the winner by 1,103,777 votes to 1,103,612 - a difference of 165 votes {{out of more than}} 2.2 million cast, or 0.007%.|$|R
60|$|It was not our Story Girl who sat there, {{telling that}} weird tale in a sibilant, {{curdling}} voice. She {{had put on}} a new personality like a garment, and that personality was a venomous, evil, loathly thing. I would rather have died than have touched the slim, brown wrist on which she supported herself. The light in <b>her</b> <b>narrowed</b> orbs was the cold, merciless gleam of the serpent's eye. I felt frightened of this unholy creature who had suddenly come in our dear Story Girl's place.|$|R

60|$|Day was a relief, a blessing. Allie was {{frequently}} cooped up in <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> canvas-covered wagon, {{but she saw}} from there {{the life of the}} grading camp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she replied, <b>her</b> eyes <b>narrowing</b> critically, [...] "that cow's horn isn't on straight--the red cow's left horn. And it's {{the same}} size, {{all the way}} up." ...|$|R
60|$|She laughed gayly, {{leaning back}} against the dark green {{upholstery}} and showing her flawless teeth; <b>her</b> long, <b>narrow</b> eyes with their seductive gleam flashed into his. A lighter spirit possessed her.|$|R

6000|$|... "Mayhap you have," [...] {{she whispered}} in return, and then, marvelling at her boldness, blushed. He glanced sharply at <b>her</b> from <b>narrowing</b> eyes. It {{was not the}} answer he had looked to hear.|$|R
60|$|Jim {{looked at}} <b>her</b> with <b>narrowed</b> eyes. He hated her voice. She let her eye rest on his for a moment. Then {{she put her}} {{cigarette}} to her lips. Robert was watching them both.|$|R
6000|$|Madame de Bellegarde {{opened her}} eyes; the scintillations {{had gone out}} of them; they were fixed and dead. But she smiled superbly with <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> little lips, and {{repeated}} Newman's word. [...] "Amusing? Have I killed some one else?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} I mean well enough," [...] said Lionel. [...] "I suppose {{you call it}} being broad-minded to trace your {{drawings}} through against the window, when mamma goes on telling you not. Better have <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> mind, say I." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Most ripping," [...] said Fanny, {{meeting his}} long, slow, sneaking glance {{with a slight}} and {{seemingly}} involuntary lift of <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> shoulder. A long look I could not share passed between them; I {{might have been a}} toy on the floor.|$|E
50|$|Askold (Аскольд) was a {{protected}} cruiser {{built for the}} Imperial Russian Navy. She was named after the legendary Varangian Askold. <b>Her</b> thin, <b>narrow</b> hull and maximum speed of 23.8 kn were considered impressive for the time.|$|R
60|$|Familiar as {{consolation}} by vague quotation was to Sister Hiler, {{there was}} an occult sympathy in the tone in which this was offered that lifted her for an instant out of <b>her</b> <b>narrower</b> self. She raised her eyes to his. The personal abstraction of the devotee had {{no place in the}} deep dark eyes that were lifted from the cradle to hers with a sad, discriminating, and almost womanly sympathy. Surprised out of her selfish preoccupation, she was reminded of her apparent callousness to what might be his present disappointment. Perhaps it seemed strange to her, too, that those tender eyes should go a-begging.|$|R
5000|$|She was {{described}} as [...] "small of stature, frail but erect", <b>her</b> face was <b>narrow,</b> <b>her</b> light-coloured eyes, cold and unmoving, and her lips thin.
