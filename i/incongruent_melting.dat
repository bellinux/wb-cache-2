50|$|<b>Incongruent</b> <b>melting</b> {{occurs when}} a solid {{substance}} does not melt uniformly, decomposing into another solid and a liquid with different compositions. For example, potassium feldspar (KAlSi3O8) decomposes to leucite (KAlSi2O6) when it melts. The decomposition is not complete, however. Most of the feldspar does melt, a portion of it decomposes to leucite and some quartz (SiO2) is left over, since the chemical formulas of potassium feldspar and leucite differ by SiO2. Another mineral that melts incongruently is enstatite (MgSiO3), which decomposes to forsterite (Mg2SiO4). Enstatite does melt congruently between pressures of 2.5 and 5.5 kilobars.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the technique of}} laser-driven directional solidification in a controlled thermal gradient of yttria stabilized zirconia core coated Y-Ba-Cu-O materials to produce textured high T(sub c) superconducting polycrystalline fibers/wires with improved critical current densities in the extended range of magnetic fields at temperatures greater than 77 K. The approach involves laser heating to minimize phase segregation by heating very rapidly through the two-phase <b>incongruent</b> <b>melt</b> region to the single phase melt region and directionally solidifying in a controlled thermal gradient to achieve highly textured grains in the fiber axis direction. The technique offers a higher grain growth rate and a lower thermal budget compared with a conventional thermal gradient and is amenable as a continuous process for improving the J(sub c) of high T(sub c) superconducting polycrystalline fibers/wires. The technique {{has the advantage of}} suppressing weak-link behavior by orientation of crystals, formation of dense structures with enhanced connectivity, formation of fewer and cleaner grain boundaries, and minimization of phase segregation in the <b>incongruent</b> <b>melt</b> region...|$|R

Aliquots of Mmhb- 1 were heated in vacuo at temperatures of 500, 700, 930 and 1050 °C for 30 min. Up to 700 °C, no physical changes in the hornblende were observed. The onset of the structural decomposition of the oxyhornblende occurs at ~ 930 °C and is directly correlated with the initial release of 6 % of its radiogenic Ar (⁴⁰Ar*). The breakdown of the oxyhornblende by the internal nucleation of <b>incongruent</b> <b>melt</b> is almost (93 %) complete by 1050 °C.

50|$|Congruent melting {{occurs during}} melting of a {{compound}} when {{the composition of}} the liquid that forms is the same as {{the composition of the}} solid.

To take a general case, let A and B be the two components and AB a stable solid compound formed by their chemical combination. If we draw a phase diagram for the system, we notice that there are three solid phases, namely A, B and compound AB. Accordingly, there will be three fusion or freezing point curves AC, BE and CDE for the three solid phases. In the phase diagram, we can notice that the top point D of the phase diagram is the congruent melting point of the compound AB because the solid and liquid phases now have the same composition. Evidently, at this temperature, the two-component system has become a one-component system because both solid and liquid phases contains only the compound AB.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} size, {{morphology}} and crystallinity of seed crystals on the nucleation {{and growth of}} large grain Y-Ba-Cu-O (YBCO) bulk superconductors fabricated by top seeded melt growth (TSMG) has been investigated. Seeding bulk samples with small, square shaped seed crystals leads to point nucleation and growth of the superconducting YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -y (Y- 123) phase that exhibits the usual square habitual growth symmetry. The use of triangular and circular shaped seed crystals, however, modifies significantly the growth habit geometry of the grain. The use of large area seeds both increases the rate of epitaxial nucleation of the Y- 123 phase and produces relatively large crystals in the <b>incongruent</b> <b>melt,</b> which decreases significantly the processing times of large grain samples. The present study is relevant to decreased processing times of samples with both preferred or no growth sectors and for multiple seeding of large grain samples which contain clean grain boundaries...|$|R

Based upon X-ray structure analysis data obtained from AlCoNi single crystals, the question has been discussed whether or not inclined net planes exist that intersect periodic as well as non-periodic directions in these quasicrystals. Several inclined net planes were proposed and ranked with respect to their structure amplitudes. We have studied single crystal growth of large decagonal Al 72 Co 9 Ni 19 quasicrystals using the Czochralski method from Al-rich melts. The crystal surfaces show a remarkable faceting. Exact angle measurements by optical goniometry revealed that the observed morphological faceting perfectly corresponds to some of the theoretically predicted inclined net planes. Besides the two different decagonal prisms 10000 and 1 0 1 ̄ 0 0 and the pinacoid 00001 we have found the inclined planes of two decagonal dipyramids 0 0 1 ̄ 1 ̄ 1 and 1 0 1 ̄ 0 2. ...|$|R

We observed that as much as 9 % of the crystalline target at Araguainha is a crystallization product after biotite breakdown.

Single crystal growth of the Al(4) (Cr,Fe) and Al(13) (Fe,Cr) (4) phases,which {{is a prerequisite for}} detailed studies is presented herein for thefirst time. Along with their binary end members Al(4) Cr and Al(13) Fe(4) growth of cm(3) -size crystals was achieved by using the Czochralskimethod from Al-rich solutions at temperatures of approximately 1000 degrees C. Special emphasis is put on the refinement of the Al-richcorner of the ternary phase diagram in determining the 1000 degrees Cequilibria between the <b>incongruent</b> <b>melts</b> and the corresponding ternarysolid solutions. Our findings confirm earlier data on the existenceregion of Al(13) (Fe,Cr) (4), but significantly differ from those withrespect to the so called Al(4) (Cr, Fe) phase. It is shown that theexistence region of Al(4) (Cr,Fe) decomposes into four regions ofstructurally different phases depending on the Cr/Fe ratio. Binarymu-Al(4) Cr crystallizes in the hexagonal space group P 6 (3) /mmc and candissolve only up to about 1 At-% iron.

The number of nuclei was remarkably reduced and random nuclei could be eased when the seeding was applied during the growth of Nd 1. 85 Ce 0. 15 CuO 4 single crystals, compared to the crystals grown without seed. The crystal could preferentially grow on the seed although some additional nuclei occurred at the solid-liquid interface during the initial growth process. In consequence, the crystal ingot obtained is a large single grain having dimensions of 5 mm in diameter and 40 mm in length. The orientation of the seeded growth crystal {{was found to be}} 5 degrees off the [100] seed identified by an x-ray Laue pattern. For the growth of Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 -delta, {{it was found that the}} seed crystal was well melted to decompose and mix with the molten zone flux composition. This led to crystal growth in accordance with the spontaneous nucleation procedure. The chemical composition of the interface between the seed and the grown crystal was determined by EDX. The growth behaviour and crystal habit show no significant change from those when seed samples are not used. This indicates that seeding does not influence the growth of Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 -delta for this <b>incongruent</b> <b>melt,</b> i. e., neither seed-orientated nor size-improved crystal is obtained. The crystal size is seen to increase significantly and the number of grains is remarkably reduced with the length of the crystal ingot grown. The crystallographic directions of [100] and [010] are well aligned along the growth direction of the crystal ingot.

A transition from granoblastic amphibolite facies metabasic rocks at the lowest metamorphic grades to metatexitic and diatexitic migmatites in the granulite facies records the effects of in situ fluid-absent partial melting. Coarse-grained euhedral clinopyroxene porphyroblasts within leucosomes are consistent with anatexis via <b>incongruent</b> fluid-absent <b>melting</b> reactions consuming hornblende, plagioclase and quartz to form clinopyroxene and melt.

Ba concentrations are extreme in both the sheets (> 1000 ppm) and the hornfels (> 800 ppm) into {{which they have been}} emplaced. We conclude that a Ba-rich, hydrothermal fluid induced melting in the aureole, and that fluid transport of Ba 2 +, and to a lesser extent, Sr 2 + and Eu 2 +, persisted in the melt zones under subsolidus conditions. Sr-isotope systematics from high-Ba localities define an errorchron of 2161 &# 177; 106 Ma with an initial (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) ratio of 0 &# 183; 705 &# 177; 0 &# 183; 001. Metasedimentary rocks unaffected by fluid infiltration were homogenized at the same time but with an increased initial ratio, suggesting that whereas isotope homogenization was achieved between outcrops permeated by fluids, {{there is no evidence of}} regional homogenization. Oxygen-isotope compositions of psammitic metasediments in the aureole are uncorrelated with distance from the contact, suggesting the infiltrating fluid equilibrated isotopically with the metasediments. Their elevated 18 O values (11 &# 183; 3 &# 150; 12 &# 183; 1 &# 137;) are consistent with a fluid source from devolatilization of the sedimentary lithologies. Textural analysis at both outcrop and thin-section scale of arkose and psammites in the aureole (Lakenvalei and Magaliesberg Formations) shows that the extent of melting was highly heterogeneous, even on the grain scale, and resulted from heterogeneously distributed infiltration of aqueous fluid on dilatant cracks and grain boundaries. Cathodoluminescence imaging of quartz shows a marked difference in the amount of fine structure, with that in the melted rocks having uniform luminescence in contrast to that in rocks containing little or no melt, which preserve textures inherited from the regionally metamorphosed protolith. Simple finite-difference thermal modelling of the aureole suggests that the width of the melt zone (> 500 m) is inconsistent with conductive heat transfer, and hence that the thermal structure has been modified by fluid advection...|$|R

MESSENGER also provided major elemental ratios of its surface {{that can be used}} to infer large-scale differentiation processes and the thermal history of the planet. Mercury is known as being very reduced, with very low Fe-content and high S and alkali contents on its surface. Its bulk composition is therefore likely close to EH enstatite chondrites. In order to elucidate the origin of the chemical diversity of Mercury's surface, we determined the melting properties of EH enstatite chondrites, at pressures between 1 bar and 3 GPa and oxygen fugacity of IW- 3 to IW- 5, using piston-cylinder experiments, combined with a previous study on EH 4 melting at 1 bar. We found that the presence of Ca-rich sulfide melts induces significant decrease of Ca-content in silicate melts at low pressure and low degree of melting (F). Also at pressures lower than 3 GPa, the SiO 2 -content decreases with F, while it increases at 3 GPa. This is likely due to the chemical composition of the bulk silicate which has a (Mg+Fe+Ca) /Si ratio very close to 1 and to the change from <b>incongruent</b> to congruent <b>melting</b> of enstatite. We then tested whether the various chemical compositions of Mercury's surface can result from mixing between two melting products of EH chondrites. We found that the majority of the geochemical provinces of Mercury's surface can be explained by mixing of two melts, with the exception of the High-Al plains that require an Al-rich source.

40|$|International audiencePost collisional {{collapse}} commonly enhances crustal melting. Such melting typically produces peraluminous granitic magmas. In the French Massif Central, a mid-crustal {{segment of}} the western Variscan belt, two large granitic bodies were produced during {{the collapse of the}} Variscan Belt. The St Sylvestre Leucogranitic Complex (SSyL) {{in the western part of}} the Massif Central and the Velay Migmatitic Complex (VMC) in the Eastern part. Although these two complexes are formed in similar geodynamic context they present meaningful petrological and geochemical differences. The VMC (~ 305 Ma) is clearly intrusive in migmatitic terranes. The migmatitic host recorded two successive melting events M 3 (720 °C and 5 kb) dated between 335 and 315 Ma and M 4 (850 °C and 4 kb) dated at 305 Ma. The compositions of the VMC are strictly H 2 O-undersaturated and ranges from leucogranitic to granodioritic. Three main successive granite types have been distinguished (1) A heterogeneous banded biotite granite, (2) A main biotite-cordierite granite, where cordierite can be prismatic, as cockade or pseudomorphic (3) a late magmatic with large K-feldspar phenocryst and prismatic cordierite. The compositions of the VMC granites are quite similar to typical Australian S-type granites in the sense that they also show a positive correlation between ferromagnesian abundance and aluminosity. The SSyL (~ 320 Ma) is intrusive in upper greenschist facies to upper amphibolite migmatitic metasediment and orthogneiss (~ 3 kb). The compositional variety observed in the SSyL suggests a continuous trend from a moderately mafic, peraluminous magma (cd- and sill- granite) to a H 2 O saturated granite ("two-mica" granite) facies and finally to an extremely felsic, H 2 O-saturated magma. Three granitic units have been recognized in the SSyL: (1) the western "Brame Unit" composed of the less evolved cd- and sill- granite facies (2) the central "St Sylvestre Unit", composed mainly by U-rich two-mica granite, intruded by two synchronously emplaced fine grained granites to its western margin: "Fanay" (biotite dominant) and "Sagne" (Li-muscovite only) (3) the eastern "St Goussaud Unit" mostly composed of a muscovite-dominant leucogranite surrounded by Sn-W mineralization. The compositions in the SSyL have a weak ferromagnesian character, negatively correlated with aluminosity and are quite similar in composition to High Himalayan syn-collisionnal peraluminous granite (e. g. Manaslu) Compositional trend of the VMC granite can be easily mimicked by the addition of peritectic material (i. e. produced during <b>incongruent</b> biotite <b>melting)</b> to experimental melts produced through the melting of metasediments (Dirty). Compositions of the SSyL are similar to experimental melt only (Tidy). Such differences in composition could be the results of different processes: 1) Different melting reactions as a consequence of different conditions of melting (e. g. different source composition, temperature). 2) The peritectic phases remained "trapped" in the source during melt extraction due to the structuration of the source or a lower melt viscosity (e. g. higher F, Li, H 2 O contents). Interestingly, while within dirty granites, peritectic phase entrainment controls compositional variability, Tidy granites display original melt compositional variability as well as the potential effects of late magmatic processes...|$|R
40|$|We {{have carried}} out major and trace element {{analyses}} and Nd–Pb isotope measurements on different components of two migmatite outcrops in the Limpopo Belt (Lose Quarry, Botswana, and Palala, South Africa) {{in order to}} assess the effect of migmatization during a high grade metamorphic event on Sm–Nd systematics and Nd model ages. The outcrops studied are located in the Mahalapye–Tshipise Straightening Zone at the south-western part of the Limpopo Central Zone close to its contact with the Kaapvaal Craton. Leucosomes of peraluminous granitic composition were formed by <b>incongruent</b> biotite <b>melting</b> in an Fe-rich metagreywacke (Lose Quarry) and in a metapelite (Palala), respectively. Monazite U–Pb and garnet Sm–Nd ages yield close to 2. 0 Ga for the high grade event, confirming other recent work in the Central Zone. The chemical compositions of the main mineral phases (feldspar, biotite and garnet) indicate minimum melt formation at T> 750 °C and low pressure. Isocon plots and Pb isotope data indicate that the partial melts are locally derived. However, LIL trace element distribution between the leucosomes and paleosomes indicate the incomplete equilibration of the nascent melts with the residual feldspars and biotite in the paleosomes. Sm–Nd results on leucosomes and paleosomes of the metagreywacke migmatite show considerable scatter. When calculated back to 2. 0 Ga, the paleosomes fall in a narrow range of ?Nd=- 4 and give TDM model ages between 2. 45 and 2. 66 Ga. The ?Nd values of leucosomes are on average four units lower, causing them to have apparent TDM ages of 2. 7 – 2. 92 Ga, on average 250 Ma older than those of the paleosomes. The REE, Th, P 2 O 5, and Zr budgets of paleosomes and leucosomes indicate dominance of the LREE by monazite and the HREE by apatite. Incorporation of proportionally more monazite than apatite into the melt is inferred as the cause for the Nd isotope discrepancy and hence the uncertainty of the average protolith mantle derivation age. In contrast, Pb–Pb results define an apparent age of 2025 ± 29 Ma, reflecting nearly full Pb isotope exchange. In the case of the Palala metapelitic migmatite, the ?Nd values at 2. 0 Ga of all but two migmatitic constituents cluster between - 7 and - 9. 5, pointing out extensive Nd isotope equilibration during migmatization, whereas the Pb isotopes yield an errorchron date of 2311 ± 65 Ma, indicating incomplete Pb isotope exchange. Here, garnet dominates the HREE distribution whereas the LREE are controlled by feldspar and monazite. Considering that Nd isotope equilibration was nearly reached during migmatization, Nd model ages on the whole rocks represent a good approximation of those of the original protolith (3. 0 – 3. 2 Ga). In the regional context, the Pb isotope data from the Lose quarry locality combined with the Nd model age (uncertain, but within the range of 2. 5 – 2. 9) are reminiscent of the northern Marginal Zone of the Limpopo Belt and the southern Zimbabwe Craton, whereas the Nd and Pb isotope data from the Palala locality are typical for the Limpopo southern Marginal Zone and the Northern Kaapvaal Craton...|$|R

In this study I report on anatectic metasediments from the Pan-African Damara Belt in Namibia that have undergone fluid-present biotite melting at a relatively low temperature, yet appear to have lost a significant volume of melt. In situ anatectic features have been identified {{on the basis of}} the existence of new generations of cordierite and/or garnet produced as the solid products of incongruent anatexis within or adjacent to leucosomes, that most commonly occur as lens shaped pods at a high angle to the lineation and formed during extension in a direction parallel to the long axis of the orogeny. Within these sites biotite underwent <b>incongruent</b> <b>melting</b> via the reaction Bt + Qtz + Pl + H 2 O = Melt + Grt + Crd. Cordierite nucleated on preexisting crystals within the bounding gneiss; garnet nucleated within the fracture sites (leucosomes) and typically occurs as individual, large (50 to 120 mm in diameter) poikiloblastic crystals. Thermobarometry applied to the anatectic assemblage yields low-temperature, granulitefacies peak conditions of 750 °C, 0. 5 GPa. This temperature is approximately 100 °C lower than the accepted conditions for the onset of fluid-absent biotite melting. This, coupled to the focussing of anatexis on extensional fractures, suggests that anatexis occurred through waterpresent biotite <b>incongruent</b> <b>melting.</b> In order to better understand this process, both fluid-absent and water present partial melting experiments were conducted within the temperature interval 700 to 900 °C at 0. 7 GPa. In the fluid-absent experiments, biotite <b>incongruent</b> <b>melting</b> started between 800 and 850 °C to produce melt coexisting with peritectic garnet and cordierite. In contrast, in water-saturated experiments, biotite melted via the reaction Bt + Pl + Q + H 2 O = Grt + Crd + Melt, between 700 and 750 °C, to produce melt, cordierite and garnet in the proportions 73 : 24 : 3...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{energy storage}} systems (TES) have {{attracted}} increasing interest for thermal {{applications such as}} hot water, space heating and cooling. These systems are useful to correct the mismatch between the supply and demand of energy. There are mainly two types of thermal energy storage systems, sensible and latent heat storage. Latent heat storage is particularly attractive due to its ability to provide a high energy storage density and its characteristics to store heat at a constant temperature corresponding to the phase transition temperature of the heat storage substance. Inorganic salt hydrates as latent heat storage materials have certain advantages over organic materials. However, some problems occur when salt hydrates are used as phase change material (PCM) in the latent heat storage applications. These are supercooling of salt hydrates when they freeze because of their weak nucleation properties and phase separation occurring because of <b>incongruent</b> <b>melting.</b> In this study, Glauber’s salt (Na 2 SO 4. 10 H 2 O) is stabilized with different concentrations of polyacrylamide and gelatin gels to prevent <b>incongruent</b> <b>melting.</b> A nucleating agent, which resembles crystal structure of Glauber’s salt, was used to prevent supercooling. Thermal storage capacities of PCM samples which are stabilized with different concentrations of polymeric gels were determined both by DSC and temperature-history methods...|$|E

Silica {{is not a major}} constituent of the interstellar medium; therefore, any silica present in the circumstellar protoplanetary disks of TTS must be largely the result of processing of primitive dust material in the disks surrouding these stars. We model the silica emission features in our spectra using the opacities of various polymorphs of silica and their amorphous versions computed from earth-based laboratory measurements. This modeling indicates that the two polymorphs of silica, tridymite and cristobalite, which form at successively higher temperatures and low pressures, are the dominant forms of silica in the TTS of our sample. These high temperature, low pressure polymorphs of silica present in protoplanetary disks are consistent with a grain composed mostly of tridymite named Ada found in the cometary dust samples collected from the STARDUST mission to Comet 81 P/Wild 2. The silica in these protoplanetary disks may arise from <b>incongruent</b> <b>melting</b> of enstatite or from <b>incongruent</b> <b>melting</b> of amorphous pyroxene, the latter being analogous to the former. The high temperatures of ∼ 1200 K- 1300 K and rapid cooling required to crystallize tridymite or cristobalite set constraints...|$|E
