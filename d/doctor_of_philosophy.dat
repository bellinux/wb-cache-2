5|$|Between 1891 and 1895, Ohio Wesleyan {{specialized}} {{the curriculum}} by establishing departments for physics, zoology, geology, speech, history, French, English, and economics. This specialization encouraged undergraduates to continue studies at graduate level, allowed professional {{preparation for the}} <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> degree, and promoted exchange study in Europe. Two professional schools for law and medicine were formed in 1896.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Siddiqui {{proceeded}} to University College London to study medicine. However, {{after one year}} of pre-medical studies, he moved to Frankfurt University in 1921 to study chemistry. In 1924, he married his German classmate, Ethel Wilhelmina Schneeman. He received <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> {{under the supervision of}} Prof Julius Von Bram in 1927.|$|E
5|$|Although Bomis began {{a search}} for experts to vet Nupedia articles, this proved tedious. In August 2000 Nupedia had more than 60 {{academics}} contributing to the peer-review process on the site, most with <b>doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>philosophy</b> or doctor of medicine degrees. Scholars wishing to contribute to Nupedia were required to submit their credentials via fax for verification. At that time, Bomis was attempting to obtain advertising revenue for Nupedia and the company was optimistic that it could fund the project with ad space on Nupedia.com.|$|E
5|$|At Berlin, Franck {{attended}} lectures by Max Planck and Emil Warburg. On 28 July 1904 {{he saved}} {{a pair of}} children from drowning in the Spree River. For his <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> (Dir. Phil.) under Warburg's supervision, Warburg suggested that he study corona discharges. Franck found this topic too complex, so he changed the focus of his thesis. Entitled Über der Beweglichkeit Ladungsträger der Spitzenentladung ("On the Mobility of Ions"), it would subsequently {{be published in the}} Annalen der Physik.|$|E

5|$|At that time, the {{university}} {{did not offer}} a <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> (PhD) program so Massey undertook a Master of Science (MSc) course, with both experimental and theoretical components. The former, in cooperation with Courtney Mohr, dealt with soft X-ray deflection from metal surfaces; the latter with wave mechanics. This involved translating numerous articles from German journals such as Zeitschrift für Physik, Annalen der Physik and Physikalische Zeitschrift. His external examiner was Ralph Fowler from the University of Cambridge, who was Paul Dirac's PhD supervisor.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence {{followed}} Swann to the University of Chicago, {{and then}} to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where Lawrence completed his <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> (Ph.D.) degree in physics in 1925 as a Sloane Fellow, writing his doctoral thesis on the photoelectric effect in potassium vapor. He was elected a member of Sigma Xi, and, on Swann's recommendation, received a National Research Council fellowship. Instead of using it to travel to Europe, as was customary at the time, he remained at Yale University with Swann as a researcher.|$|E

5|$|On {{returning}} to the United States in 1928, Birch went back to Harvard to pursue physics.

For his thesis, Birch measured the vapor-liquid critical point of mercury. He determined this as 1460±20°C and 1640±50kg/cm2, results he published in 1932 in the Physical Review.|$|E

Beginning that year, he attended Balliol College, Oxford, returning to Australia in 1935.

5|$|After {{retiring}} from the civil service, Hickling became a law academic. He was a lecturer at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London (which awarded him a <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> (Ph.D.) in Law) from 1976 to 1978 and from 1981 to 1982 where he taught Southeast Asian law, and a visiting lecturer at the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law from 1974 to 1976 and again from 1978 to 1980. He was also adjunct Professor of Southeast Asian Law at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (National University of Malaysia) in Bangi, Selangor, for six years.|$|E
5|$|Born in Yorkshire, Wooller {{attended}} Millbridge Upper School and Heckmondwike Grammar School. He {{began his}} career as a banker, which took him to Bangladesh and Pakistan. When he returned to Yorkshire, he took a job with Peat Marwick, an accounting firm. In 1970, Wooller attended the London School of Economics to take a two-year Master of Science in accounting and finance. After the course ended in 1972, he went to Cass Business School and received a <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy.</b> At Cass Business School, Wooller together with Dr Peter Grinyer conducted extensive research into the corporate models of projects sponsored by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.|$|E

5|$|Business {{courses were}} first {{offered at the}} Massachusetts Agricultural College {{in the early years}} of the twentieth century, {{expanding}} rapidly during the 1930s and 1940s in response to student demand. The Board of Trustees established the School of Business Administration in 1947, and within seven years, it was conferring graduate degrees, including doctorates after 1967. The school was accredited at the undergraduate level by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business in May 1958, and in March 1959, the Board of Trustees authorized the establishment of four academic departments within the school: Accounting, General Business and Finance, Management, and Marketing. In September 1967, a program leading to the degree of <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> in Business Administration was introduced.|$|E
5|$|From 1954 to 1959 Dawkins {{attended}} Oundle School in Northamptonshire, an English {{public school}} with a distinct Church of England flavour, where he was in Laundimer house. While at Oundle, Dawkins read Bertrand Russell's Why I Am Not a Christian for the first time. He studied zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1962; while there, he was tutored by Nobel Prize-winning ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen. He continued as a research student under Tinbergen's supervision, receiving his MA and <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> degrees by 1966, and remained a research assistant for another year. Tinbergen was {{a pioneer in the}} study of animal behaviour, particularly in the areas of instinct, learning and choice; Dawkins's research in this period concerned models of animal decision-making.|$|E
5|$|In retrospect, {{being sent}} {{far from the}} Middle East (Egypt) he viewed as a parental {{decision}} much influenced by “the prospects of deracinated people, like us the Palestinians, being so uncertain {{that it would be}} best to send me as far away as possible.” The realities of peripatetic life—of interwoven cultures, of feeling out of place, and of homesickness—so affected the schoolboy Edward that themes of dissonance feature in the work and worldview of the academic Said. At school’s end, he had become Edward W. Said—a polyglot intellectual (fluent in English, French, and Arabic) who had earned a Bachelor of Arts (1957) degree at Princeton University, and Master of Arts (1960) and <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> (1964) degrees in English Literature from Harvard University.|$|E
