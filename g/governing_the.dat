5|$|As a {{legal advisor}} {{working for the}} United States Department of War, he drafted {{recommendations}} and reports that were used by Congress and the executive branch in <b>governing</b> <b>the</b> United States' new territories following the Spanish–American War.

5|$|Byzantine {{authors were}} the first to record these events. The {{earliest}} work is Emperor Leo the Wise's Tactics, finished around 904, which recounts the Bulgarian-Byzantine war of 894–896, a military conflict directly preceding the Hungarians' departure from the Pontic steppes. Nearly contemporary narration can be read in the Continuation of the Chronicle by George the Monk. However, De Administrando Imperio ("On <b>Governing</b> <b>the</b> Empire") provides the most detailed account. It was compiled under the auspices of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in 951 or 952.|$|E

2500|$|During the British colonial period, {{the colonial}} {{government}} basically adopted {{the approach of}} using [...] "the Chinese to <b>govern</b> <b>the</b> Chinese". They appointed Chinese leaders to <b>govern</b> <b>the</b> Chinese community. Effectively, the Chinese community existed in a half-autonomy state. Most Chinese leaders used the Chinese civil societies (small organisations) to help <b>govern</b> <b>the</b> Chinese community and to help new Chinese immigrants settled into Singapore, including finding jobs and lodgings for them.|$|R
5|$|Despite these grand designs Domitian was {{determined}} to govern the Empire conscientiously and scrupulously. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: edicts were issued <b>governing</b> <b>the</b> smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. According to Suetonius, the imperial bureaucracy never ran more efficiently than under Domitian, whose exacting standards and suspicious nature maintained historically low corruption among provincial governors and elected officials.|$|E

5|$|For {{aerodynamic}} aircraft which operate {{relative to}} the air, winds affect groundspeed, {{and in the case}} of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind may play a significant or solitary role in their movement and ground track. The velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor <b>governing</b> <b>the</b> direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances, a headwind is generally desirable. A tailwind increases takeoff distance required and decreases the climb gradient.|$|E

5|$|Hancock's {{time in the}} West was brief.

The general who offended Johnson the most was Philip Sheridan, and Johnson soon ordered General Grant to switch the assignments of Hancock and Sheridan, believing that Hancock, a Democrat, would govern in a style more to Johnson's liking. Although neither man {{was pleased with the}} change, Sheridan reported to Fort Leavenworth and Hancock to New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that the Court {{rejected}} the argument that Pedra Branca was terra nullius in 1847, Singapore contended that the selection of Pedra Branca as the site for Horsburgh Lighthouse and the construction of the lighthouse between 1847 and 1851 constituted a taking of possession of the island à titre de souverain (with the title of a sovereign). The British Crown obtained title over the island in accordance with legal principles <b>governing</b> <b>the</b> acquisition of territory at that time. This title was maintained by the United Kingdom and its lawful successor, the Republic of Singapore.|$|E

5|$|Pipes are {{arranged}} by timbre and pitch into ranks. A rank {{is a set}} of pipes of the same timbre but multiple pitches (one for each note on the keyboard), which is mounted (usually vertically) onto a windchest. The stop mechanism admits air to each rank. For a given pipe to sound, the stop <b>governing</b> <b>the</b> pipe's rank must be engaged, and the key corresponding to its pitch must be depressed. Ranks of pipes are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own keyboard and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.|$|E
