25|$|There are {{two major}} groups of TCAs in terms of {{chemical}} structure, which most, but not all, TCAs fall into. The groupings {{are based on the}} tricyclic ring system. They are the dibenzazepines (imipramine, <b>desipramine,</b> clomipramine, trimipramine, lofepramine) and the dibenzocycloheptadienes (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, butriptyline). Minor TCA groups based on ring system include the dibenzoxepins (doxepin), the dibenzothiepines (dosulepin), and the dibenzoxazepines (amoxapine). In addition to classification based on the ring system, TCAs can also be usefully grouped {{based on the number of}} substitutions of the side chain amine. These groups include the tertiary amines (imipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, amitriptyline, butriptyline, doxepin, dosulepin) and the secondary amines (<b>desipramine,</b> nortriptyline, protriptyline). Lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, but acts largely as a prodrug of <b>desipramine,</b> a secondary amine, and hence is more similar in profile to the secondary amines than to the tertiary amines. Amoxapine does not have the TCA side chain and hence is neither a tertiary nor secondary amine, although it is often grouped with the secondary amines due to sharing more in common with them.|$|E
25|$|The stimulants are {{the first}} line of {{treatment}} for ADHD, with proven efficacy, but they do fail in up to 20% of cases, even in patients without tic disorders. Current prescribed stimulant medications include: methylphenidate (brand names Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall). Other medications can be used when stimulants are not an option. These include the alpha-2 agonists (clonidine and guanfacine), tricyclic antidepressants (<b>desipramine</b> and nortriptyline), and newer antidepressants (bupropion and venlafaxine). There have been case reports of tics worsening with bupropion (brand name Wellbutrin). There is good empirical evidence for short-term safety and efficacy for the use of <b>desipramine,</b> bupropion and atomoxetine (Strattera).|$|E
25|$|Clinically {{significant}} {{drug interactions}} with the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline, the CYP2C9 substrate tolbutamide, the CYP2D6 substrate <b>desipramine,</b> and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam have all been demonstrated with cimetidine, and interactions with other substrates of these enzymes are likely as well.|$|E
25|$|Imipramine is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include <b>desipramine</b> (N-desmethylimipramine), clomipramine (3-chloroimipramine), trimipramine (2'-methylimipramine or β-methylimipramine), and lofepramine (N-(4-chlorobenzoylmethyl)desipramine). Imipramine is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite <b>desipramine</b> being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine. The chemical name of imipramine is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzoazepin-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H2N2 with a molecular weight of 280.407g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the embonate (pamoate) salt is used for intramuscular administration and the free base form is not used. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 50-49-7, of the hydrochloride is 113-52-0, and of the embonate is 10075-24-8.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline is a {{moderate}} inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP2B6 in vitro. Accordingly, in human trials it caused increased {{blood levels of}} CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol, dextromethorphan, <b>desipramine,</b> imipramine and nortriptyline, {{as well as the}} CYP3A4/CYP2D6 substrate haloperidol. This effect is dose-dependent. In a placebo-controlled study, the concomitant administration of sertraline and methadone caused a 40% increase in blood levels of the latter, which is primarily metabolized by CYP2B6. Sertraline is often used in combination with stimulant medication for the treatment of co-morbid depression and/or anxiety in ADHD. Amphetamine metabolism inhibits enzyme CYP2D6, but has not been known to interfere with Sertraline metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Clomipramine is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include imipramine, <b>desipramine,</b> and trimipramine. Clomipramine is a derivative of imipramine with a chlorine atom added to one of its rings and {{is also known as}} 3-chloroimipramine. It is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desmethylclomipramine being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, imipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine. The chemical name of clomipramine is 3-(3-chloro-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzoazepin-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H23ClN2 with a molecular weight of 314.857g/mol. The drug is used commercially almost exclusively as the hydrochloride salt; the free base has been used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 303-49-1 and of the hydrochloride is 17321-77-6.|$|E
2500|$|Dopamine: {{imipramine}} blocks D2 receptors. Imipramine, and its metabolite <b>desipramine,</b> have no appreciable {{affinity for}} the dopamine transporter (Ki = 8,500 and >10,000nM, respectively).|$|E
2500|$|Highly plasma protein-bound drugs: atomoxetine has the {{potential}} to displace these drugs from plasma proteins which may potentiate their adverse or toxic effects. In vitro, atomoxetine does not affect the plasma protein binding of aspirin, <b>desipramine,</b> diazepam, paroxetine, phenytoin, or warfarin ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that stimulants do not {{exacerbate}} tics any more than placebo does, and suggest that stimulants may even reduce tic severity. A 2011 Cochrane Collaboration review concluded that most major ADHD medications were effective in children with tics, and that stimulants did not generally worsen tics outside of individual cases. Methylphenidate, guanfacine, clonidine, and <b>desipramine</b> were associated with improvement of tic symptoms. Controversy remains, and the PDR continues to carry a warning that stimulants should not be used in the presence of tic disorders, so physicians may be reluctant to use them. Others are comfortable using them and even advocate for a stimulant trial when ADHD co-occurs with tics, because the symptoms of ADHD can be more impairing than tics.|$|E
2500|$|Clomipramine was {{the first}} drug that was {{investigated}} for and found {{to be effective in}} the treatment of OCD. In addition, it {{was the first}} drug to be approved by the [...] in the United States for the treatment of OCD. The effectiveness of clomipramine in the treatment of OCD is far greater than that of other TCAs, which are comparatively weak SRIs; a meta-analysis found pre- versus post-treatment effect sizes of 1.55 for clomipramine relative to a range of 0.67 for imipramine and 0.11 for <b>desipramine.</b> In contrast to other TCAs, studies have found that clomipramine and SSRIs, which are more potent SRIs, have similar effectiveness in the treatment of OCD. However, multiple meta-analyses have found that clomipramine nonetheless retains a significant effectiveness advantage relative to SSRIs; in the same meta-analysis mentioned previously, the effect sizes of SSRIs in the treatment of OCD ranged from 0.81 for fluoxetine to 1.36 for sertraline (relative to 1.55 for clomipramine). However, the effectiveness advantage for clomipramine has not been apparent in head-to-head comparisons of clomipramine versus SSRIs for OCD. The differences in effectiveness findings could be due to differences in methodologies across non-head-to-head studies.|$|E

50|$|<b>Desipramine</b> has {{the weakest}} {{antihistamine}} and anticholinergic {{effects of the}} TCAs. It tends to be slightly activating/stimulating rather than sedating, unlike most others TCAs. Whereas other TCAs are useful for treating insomnia, <b>desipramine</b> can cause insomnia as a side effect due to its activating properties. The drug is also not associated with weight gain, in contrast to many other TCAs. Secondary amine TCAs like <b>desipramine</b> and nortriptyline have a lower risk of orthostatic hypotension than other TCAs, although <b>desipramine</b> can still cause moderate orthostatic hypotension.|$|E
50|$|<b>Desipramine</b> is {{particularly}} toxic {{in cases of}} overdose, compared to other antidepressants. Any overdose or suspected overdose of <b>desipramine</b> {{is considered to be}} a medical emergency and can result in death without prompt medical intervention.|$|E
50|$|It is {{extensively}} metabolized, via cleavage of the p-chlorophenacyl group, to the TCA, <b>desipramine,</b> in humans. However, it {{is unlikely}} this property plays a substantial role in its overall effects as lofepramine exhibits lower toxicity and anticholinergic side effects relative to <b>desipramine</b> while retaining equivalent antidepressant efficacy. The p-chlorophenacyl group is metabolized to p-chlorobenzoic acid which is then conjugated with glycine and excreted in the urine. The <b>desipramine</b> metabolite is partly secreted in the faeces. Other routes of metabolism include hydroxylation, glucuronidation, N-dealkylation and N-oxidation.|$|E

50|$|Lofepramine is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include imipramine, <b>desipramine,</b> clomipramine, and trimipramine. Lofepramine is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite <b>desipramine</b> being a secondary amine. Unlike other tertiary amine TCAs, lofepramine has a bulky 4-chlorobenzoylmethyl substituent on its amine instead of a methyl group. Although lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, it acts in large part as a prodrug of <b>desipramine,</b> and is more similar to secondary amine TCAs in its effects.
