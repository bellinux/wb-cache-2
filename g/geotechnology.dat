The diversity of teacher practices can be linked to the powerful potential of these technologies for the access and the analysis of geographical and geological information. The characteristics of these tools suit pedagogies based on projects, problem-solving or collaborative work even if it has to be considered that a majority of teachers use them in more traditional ways.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{geography}} has diversified {{the use of}} new technologies for spatial analysis. <b>Geotechnologies</b> yield great support for geographical research, because they allow a different look at the space; the use as a tool in classrooms contributes {{to the education of}} critical citizens. In Brazil, textbooks just remain as the principal or the unique source of information for basic education teachers. Thus, training is the greatest difficulty for new technologies to be inserted in the reality of schools. The objective of this work is to analyse the didactic use of <b>geotechnologies</b> in geography textbooks used all over the country for secondary education, as appointed by the National Textbook Program for Secondary Education (PNLDEM) of the Ministry of Education (MEC) After analyzing six textbooks, it was realized that <b>geotechnologies</b> are present, but their use is still incipient: the number of pages devoted to discuss <b>geotechnologies</b> and/or their use for some contents of geography are still too much reduced when compared with the average number of pages of a secondary education textbook. There is a need to seek improvements for textbooks, but even with advances in quality, the teacher cannot rely only on this source of information to prepare a lecture. He/she is also a professional researcher and needs to be always searching for more efficient ways to educate citizens. Pages: 3295 - 330...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a methodological {{approach to a}} temporal analysis of the urban occupation process of the basin of the Ribeirão Vermelho River, in São José dos Campos SP, between 1988 and 2007, {{with the support of}} <b>geotechnologies.</b> The analysis procedure consisted in the elaboration of a digital cartographical database in the 1 : 10. 000 scale, used to generate land use and cover maps through the analysis and interpretation of aerial photos and high resolution satellite images. At the same time it was made a rehearsal about the legislation related with the research area, with the purpose to compare land use and cover change and urbanization process during the analyzed period of time, as well as a field research to update the database and to allow an in-depth comprehension of the area problems. The time analysis showed the relevance of the use of <b>geotechnologies</b> as an aid to understand the urban space change processes that, in this case, were driven by a series of features like the modification of the original urbanization plans for the area and the lack of respect to the law, demonstrating the need to think about the urban interventions with the aim of reestablish and keep the environmental balance.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} present the methodological {{approach}} of the agroecological zoning of Mato Grosso do Sul State. The approach incorporated quantitative and qualitative assessment, with <b>geotechnologies</b> (satellite image–landsat 5, global positioning system, geographic information system, digital mapping, software of digital image processing) adoption to perform an integrated analysis of environmental data. Primary soils information associated with terrain attributes and climate characteristics were used with <b>geotechnologies</b> to evaluation of the natural erosion potential, natural fertility, internal drainage and moisture soil retention capacity of soil. The land use, and land cover and the environmental laws were observed. The integrated analysis of these data allowed environmental stratification in different agroecological zones. These zones are defined to agricultural use; pastures; conservation of natural resources or ecological restoration. In Bandeirantes case study, the agroecological zones recommended for agriculture sum 1, 150 km 2. The evaluation for conservation {{of natural resources and}} ecological results in 310 km 2, and for the areas recommended for pastures sum 1, 650 km 2 or 53 % of Bandeirantes municipality.

40|$|International audienceIn Sète, a small French {{southern}} town nearby the Mediterranean Sea, six companies are competing to implement new energies into the city. The companies are specialized in different “green” energies: heat pumps, windmills, ocean wave energy, photovoltaics and methanization. Each {{of them has}} to convince the committee tender responsible for the call for project that their project is the best for a sustainable development of the city. But they have to face cons from an active local association of citizens before they vote to choose the best project. The debate is tricky and the competition is merciless. Each one {{is aware of the}} importance of the stakes and is deeply involved in the struggle… but this is “only a game”. The “mayor of the city” is a secondary teacher. The “companies”, the “committee tender” and “association of inhabitants” are the different characters playing by secondary students. This role-playing game has been designed with <b>geotechnologies.</b> The different characters get data from a virtual globe. They use it to locate their project and to demonstrate its impact on the environment. The different characters have to judge the relevance of the projects on the field. To do that, they use pocket PCs with GPS functionalities that display interviews of local “inhabitants” when they reach the places where the projects are planned to be implemented. They get information from these interviews and from the field itself. Therefore the game includes the use of Augmented Reality. In this paper we describe an empirical research into the uses of <b>geotechnologies</b> to design a role-playing game for the development of citizenship. The research questions focus on the elements that the teacher should take into account to design such a role-playing game. We address the question of the added value of <b>geotechnologies</b> to design complex learning situations. Then, we discuss the relevance of <b>geotechnologies</b> to design a Game-Based-Learning situation which aims at developing citizenship for secondary students...|$|R

40|$|The city of São José dos Campos is {{the most}} {{important}} city located at the Region of Paraíba River Valley, considering the process of industrialization.

40|$|The <b>geotechnology</b> in {{the last}} years {{established}} as an important tool in geographical studies. Remote sensing data, Geographic Information System (GIS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) are the main examples of these tools that helped to observe and understanding the geographic environment. However, the knowledge concerning these elements is in most part limited to the universities and to specifically business companies. In this context, the main goal of this research is to contextualize the utilizing of geotechonology as a tool to subsidize the teaching of geography in some schools of Alfenas-MG town, considering students of elementary and high school cycles. The research also used maps developed from remote sensing data as CBERS- 2 B/CCD and Landsat- 5 /TM in practical class activities. Results denote that the most part of teachers rarely use <b>geotechnology</b> tools to help in classroom teaching. In addition, few teachers have extensive knowledge about the theme, unknowing the main concepts and capabilities. Similar situation might be observed with the elementary and high school students, which have scarce knowledge about the <b>geotechnology.</b> This configuration might be resulted from the unsatisfying instruction of the teachers, which in most part did not have this type of technology when was students in the universities. In addition, in some cases the teachers suffer with the absence of good conditions of job, which difficult the utilization of <b>geotechnology</b> resources in the classroom. The updating of these teachers about <b>geotechnology</b> and better conditions of job are fundamental to teaching with quality and efficience. Pages: 3287 - 329...|$|E
