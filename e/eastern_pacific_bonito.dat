50|$|Sarda chiliensis, the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>bonito,</b> is {{a marine}} species of bonito. It ranges from Ecuador to Chile. Sarda lineolata, which ranges from Alaska to Mexico has been {{considered}} a subspecies, as Sarda chiliensis lineolata, but this treatment renders the species geographically disjunct.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} of an acoustic telemetry tag used to monitor electromyograms (EMGs) remotely from free-swimming marine fish. The device described amplifies and filters the EMG and then converts the electrical waveform into a frequency-modulated acoustic signal that is transmitted through water. The signal is then received, demodulated and recorded by the receiving system. The EMG tag described has been tested on a range of species, including toadfish Opsanus tau, spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias, yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares and <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>bonito</b> Sarda chiliensis, in different tank Summary environments. In certain tanks the fidelity with which the system replicates the EMG is sufficient to quantify accurately the onset, offset, duration, the integrated area under the absolute value of the signal and the number of signal zero crossings. This EMG tag will expand the scope of questions that can be addressed about the behavior and physiology of free-swimming fish...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addressed {{questions related}} to the selective advantages of regional endothermy and its independent evolution among several fish groups. The chapters integrate laboratory and field physiological measurements to provide a better understanding ofthe evolution of regional endothermy and its importance as an adaptation to the pelagic environment. Studies on the swimming energetics of the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>bonito</b> (Sarda chiliensis) revealed that the bonito had a similar cost of transport to that of similar sized yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and that the bonito had a significantly lower standard metabolic rate than tuna. Thermal studies on live slender tuna, Allothunnus fallai, {{were the first to}} document both red muscle (RM) and eye and brain endothermy for this species and establish regional endothermy as a synapomorphy of the Tribe Thunnini. Additional findings for A. fallai revealed this species to possess a brain heater, a thermogenic organ composed of portions of all four of the rectus muscles. These findings demonstrate that the use of a heater tissue to elevate cranial temperatures has evolved independently in at least three fish groups. Movement studies on the mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) used acoustic telemetry to record the in-vivo stomach temperatures and depth distribution off the coast of Southern California. This work showed that the tracked makos remained in the upper 12 m of the water column during up to 80 % of the track period and that larger makos dove to greater depths. Stomach temperature data were recorded for all tracked makos (including young of the year), and these data were used to document feeding events in five of the seven tracking sessions. A study on the muscle morphology of three thresher shark species (common thresher, Alopias vulpinus, pelagic thresher, A. pelagicus, and bigeye thresher, A. superciliosus) revealed interspecific differences in the RM transverse position and distribution along the body. The common thresher is the only alopiid to possess a RM arrangement {{similar to that of the}} endothermic lamnid sharks, suggesting that this species is likely the only thresher to be capable of RM endothermy...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the quasi-biennial tendency in El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) -monsoon coupled system is investigated using an intermediate coupled model. The monsoon wind forcing is prescribed {{as a function of}} Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies based on the relationship between zonal wind anomalies over the western Pacific to sea level change in the equatorial <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific.</b> The key {{mechanism of}} quasi-biennial tendency in El Nino evolution is found to be in the strong coupling of ENSO to monsoon wind forcing over the western Pacific. Strong boreal summer monsoon wind forcing, which lags the maximum SST anomaly in the equatorial <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> approximately 6 months, tends to generate Kelvin waves of the opposite sign to anomalies in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific</b> and initiates the turnabout in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific.</b> Boreal winter monsoon forcing, which has zero lag with maximum SST in the equatorial <b>eastern</b> <b>Pacific,</b> tends to damp the ENSO oscillations...|$|R
