500|$|Ellen Cheeseman-Meyer, {{writing for}} Tor.com in February 2013, said that Killing Time was [...] "incredibly romantic". She stated that <b>it</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> of 18th century {{literary}} Romanticism, [...] "which suggested that morality lay {{in nature and}} civilization was a corrupting influence". She said that whilst it could be considered [...] "a trivial piece of fluff tossed off by a fan writer and published when Pocket Books wasn’t paying much attention", {{it could also be}} seen to be a [...] "call to action that requires readers to examine their relationships and their actions". In [...] Elizabeth Woledge's article for Extrapolation, entitled [...] "From Slash to the Mainstream: Female Writers and Gender Blending Men", she describes Killing Time as [...] "erotic but not sexual" [...] and said that Spock and Kirk both [...] "combine masculine and feminine imagery". She suggested that it was not the romantic overtones that caused the reaction, but rather that it was this gender-blending that was the issue.|$|E

He gave the episode a score of three out of four.|$|E

A reviewer for Rap-Up described the video as [...] "wild" [...] and [...] "colorful", and noted {{that it seems to}} be inspired by the Beastie Boys' classic [...] "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)" [...] (1987). Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly called the video [...] "a weird one".

[...] CNN's Lisa Respers France embraced the [...] "completely random and bizarre" [...] song choice, writing that <b>it</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> of the first season, [...] "when [...] never knew what to expect and [...] was often happily surprised."

The movie became Witherspoon's biggest live-action box office hit, earning over $35 million in the opening weekend and grossing over $127 million in the U.S. Despite the commercial success, critics gave Sweet Home Alabama negative reviews. It was called [...] "a romantic comedy so rote, dull and predictable" [...] by The Miami Herald, and the press widely agreed that Witherspoon was the only reason the movie attracted such a large audience.

With that said, the singer felt [...] "stifled" [...] and unable to express every feeling she wanted to show. However, she noted that with [...] "Rocket", one of the most liberating songs on the record, she managed to express many of those feelings and show different sides of her personality. Revealing that she would not have been confident enough to record the song earlier in her career, Beyoncé noted, [...] "I kinda dropped that fourth wall and I did it". The singer also discussed the meaning of the song by saying, [...] "What I love about this song is, it takes you through this journey. You're flirting and you're talking all of your arrogant [...] Then you climax, and then you have your cigarette... This song actually is about singing from the heart, and harmonies and adlibs and arrangement". During the same video, she praised Timberlake and Miguel's work; the clip also showed footage of Beyoncé recording the song in the studio.|$|E
