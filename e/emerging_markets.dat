40|$|This paper explores {{issues in}} <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> {{countries}} to make inflation targeting work for them. It starts by outlining why <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> economies {{are so different}} from advanced economies and then discuss why developing strong fiscal, financial and monetary institutions is so {{critical to the success}} of inflation targeting in <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> countries. Then it discusses two <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> countries which illustrate what it takes to make inflation targeting work well, Chile and Brazil. It then addresses a particularly complicated issue for central banks in <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> countries who engage in inflation targeting: how they deal with exchange rate fluctuations. The next topic focuses on the IMF's role in promoting the success of inflation targeting in <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> countries. The conclusion from this analysis is that inflation targeting is more complicated in <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> countries and is thus not a panacea. However, inflation targeting done right can be a powerful tool to help promote macroeconomic stability in these countries. ...|$|R
40|$|Common {{factors in}} <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> spreads 1 <b>Emerging</b> <b>market</b> bond debt {{has become an}} {{increasingly}} important asset class for portfolio managers and, over the last decade, emerged as a key source of funds for <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> governments. Spreads on <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> bond debt across countries tend to move in tandem over time, suggesting that one or more common factors drive their movements. Yet despite its relevance to portfolio management, the degree of common variation in spreads on <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> debt, {{and the number of}} underlying factors that might drive this covariation, has received little attention in the asset pricing literature. This article investigates the extent to which spreads on <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> sovereign debt react to forces that are common across markets. Similar in spirit to the Litterman and Scheinkman (1991) analysis of the US Treasury yield curve, and to the extensive work in the asset pricing literature on the factors driving equity returns, we use principal factor analysis to determine the number of common factors that drive movements in <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> bond spreads...|$|R

Our results indicate that <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> firms’ location choices differ from the choices of other investors. <b>Emerging</b> <b>market</b> firms place, on average, a higher value on urbanization, diversification economies and sector-specific human resources.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{whether the}} recent buildup in <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> countries’ international reserves {{can be justified}} as precautionary insurance against volatility in capital flows. It presents a simple, welfare-based model of the optimal level of reserves {{to deal with the}} risk of capital account crises and calibrates the model for <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> countries. The levels of reserves observed in many countries in the recent period, in particular in Latin America, are found to be within the range of the model’s predictions. However, the reserves buildup in Asian <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> countries seems difficult to justify on precautionary grounds. A large fraction of their reserves could thus be diversified into less liquid but higher-yielding foreign assets.

5|$|RIRP {{rests on}} several assumptions, {{including}} efficient markets, no country risk premia, and zero {{change in the}} expected real exchange rate. The parity condition suggests that real interest rates will equalize between countries and that capital mobility will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for arbitrage. There exists strong evidence that RIRP holds tightly among <b>emerging</b> <b>markets</b> in Asia and also Japan. The half-life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months, but between two and three months for certain countries. Such variation in the half-lives of deviations may be reflective of differences {{in the degree of}} financial integration among the country groups analyzed. RIRP does not hold over short time horizons, but empirical evidence has demonstrated that it generally holds well across long time horizons of five to ten years.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the market}} {{turbulence}} of the 1990s financial crises and September 11 {{attacks on the}} U.S. in 2001, financial integration intensified among developed nations and <b>emerging</b> <b>markets,</b> with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial derivatives and structured finance products. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily {{in the form of}} short-term money market instruments. The United States experienced growth in the size and complexity of firms engaged in a broad range of financial services across borders {{in the wake of the}} Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 which repealed the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, ending limitations on commercial banks' investment banking activity.

We find that country illiquidity plays {{a significant role in the}} premium of <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> funds. However, in developed market funds country illiquidity is not significant. Fund illiquidity, in contrast, is significant for developed market funds but not for <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> funds.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{cross-border}} impact of quantitative easing (QE) {{in the major}} advanced economies, especially on <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> economies. We first examine the cross-border financial market impact of central bank announcements of asset purchase programmes. We find marked QE announcement effects on global financial markets. Quantitative easing influenced prices of {{a broad range of}} <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> assets, raising equity prices, lowering government and corporate bond yields and compressing CDS spreads. The evidence supports the view that QE programmes in advanced economies influenced market expectations about the strength of cross-border financial flows to <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> economies and about accommodative monetary policy responses of <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> central banks to concerns about these capital flows. In other words, the announcement of QE measures in one economy contributed to easier global liquidity conditions through the immediate re-pricing of assets in global financial markets. We then turn to the macroeconomic impact of US quantitative easing on <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> and advanced economies using a global vector error-correcting model (VECM). In additiona...|$|R

Further, we demonstrate that not all <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> firms can leverage CSAs equally and that EMNEs are better at exploiting CSAs than their non-MNE domestic counterparts. We also demonstrate that developed country MNEs operating in <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> economies are not as good as leveraging available CSAs as their EMNE competitors, arguably on account of liability of foreignness.

40|$|The {{failure of}} {{uncovered}} interest rate parity (UIP) {{is a well-known}} phenomenon of the last thirty years. UIP failure is more prominent in advanced economies than in <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> economies. Typically, UIP estimation for an advanced economy generates a negative coefficient, meaning that a higher interest rate in advanced economy A {{will result in the}} appreciation of economy A's exchange rate. For <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> economies, higher interest rates usually correspond to future depreciation, although this depreciation is not sufficient for UIP to hold. This paper shows that UIP holds in Russia better than in other <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> economies when the UIP equation accounts for a constant risk premium. Consequently, there is no forward premium puzzle for Russian data for 2001 – 2014. To determine the results for Russia and to compare them with the results for other countries, we estimate UIP first for Russia and then for advanced and <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> economies using seemingly unrelated regressions and panel data analysis. By comparing the profitability of static and dynamic carry trade strategies, we also confirm that in <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> economies, risk premiums are often constant, whereas in advanced economies, risk premiums are almost always volatile. This may explain why UIP holds better in <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> economies. It also enables us to formulate a hypothesis that macroeconomic policies of <b>emerging</b> <b>market</b> economies (e. g., the accumulation of large foreign exchange reserves) stabilize risk premiums...|$|R
