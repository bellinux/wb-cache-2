Visual elements in the Settings app, quick toggles in the notification dropdown, and new language and emoji support were also positive highlights in the review.

He also wrote that installing and launching apps might be [...] "a little faster than usual" [...] thanks to Nougat's new app compiler, and he hoped game developers will utilize the new Vulkan API for some [...] "seriously good-looking mobile gaming".|$|R
