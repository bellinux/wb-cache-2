30|$|The {{question}} of whether state parties may derogate from economic, social and cultural rights in times of public emergency has {{been a matter of}} much debate. Derogating from a right essentially allows states to put their obligations on hold for a specified period of time. As derogating is a somewhat extreme measure, whether or not a particular right may be derogated from, and under which circumstances, is usually laid down in the text of a human rights treaty. However, {{this is not the case}} for the ICESCR, which neither contains a derogation clause allowing for derogations, nor a provision prohibiting derogations. This is unlike the ICCPR, Article 4 of which specifies the conditions for <b>derogations</b> <b>from</b> its provisions, and prohibits <b>derogations</b> <b>from</b> several rights (Article 4, paragraphs 1 and 2, respectively). Nonetheless, the fact that there is no derogation clause in ICESCR does not necessarily mean that states would be precluded from derogating from them.|$|R
