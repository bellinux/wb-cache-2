40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic model of residential real <b>estate</b> <b>tenure</b> decisions {{that takes into}} account the substantial transaction costs and the uncertain time paths of rents and prices. By temporarily postponing decisions, buyers and sellers obtain additional information and may avoid transactions that are costly to reverse. One implication is that the combination of high transaction costs and substantial uncertainty can create a large wedge between a household's reservation prices for buying and selling a home, which can explain why households do not switch back and forth between owning and renting as home prices fluctuate.

40|$|We study {{a natural}} {{experiment}} in the Czech Republic where the maximum regulated rent appreciation has depended explicitly {{on the price of}} real estate since 2007. We track the tenure choice of households from consumption surveys for subsequent years. Rent deregulation makes households in regulated apartments more likely to own real estate while the opposite is true for other renters and owners. The net present value of buying property vs renting is an increasing function of the real estate price appreciation for renters in regulated apartments. We use their tenure choice to generate the distribution of property price expectations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to define mixed <b>tenure</b> <b>estates</b> as {{comprising}} any mix of social housing tenants with: private renting tenants (who therefore have private landlords); shared owners (i. e. those who buy a part share in their home, the remaining share being typically retained by social landlord); owner occupiers (bought outright, or those paying a mortgage on the whole value of the property). – A literature review and interviews with Registered Social Landlord (RSL) personnel are used to inform the discussion contained in this paper. The term “Asset Management” is used to describe the management of estates, including maintenance, repair and other physical investment. The research methodology is based on a case study of a social housing provider, supported by semi-structured interviews. – The main conclusion of this paper is that, along with a number of other issues, inter-working at the case study RSL needs to be improved if mixed <b>tenure</b> <b>estates</b> are to succeed. – Little work has been undertaken in this specific area, and the research should be of interest to a wide audience including social housing developers, urban researchers and central and local government.

40|$|Reviews {{of mixed}} tenure {{research}} have highlighted {{the lack of}} attention given to the processes of delivering mix. This research investigates {{the relationship between the}} spatial configuration of tenures produced within neighbourhoods, and residents’ views on the benefits and drawbacks of mixed tenure and their reported social interactions within and across tenures. Further, we consider how these effects are bound up with the particular contexts and development histories, or ‘modes of production’, of mixed <b>tenure</b> <b>estates.</b> Two peripheral estates and one inner city estate converted to mixed tenure over the past 10 – 20  years in Glasgow were examined through qualitative research with 37 residents in 7 neighbourhoods. The majority of respondents were positive about mixed tenure, though owners were more likely to qualify their support. Residents living in spatially integrated neighbourhoods were the most positive overall, and those in segregated neighbourhoods the least so. More positive views and accounts of mixed tenure were also most common on the estate which had been entirely redeveloped through a master-planning process...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade many social housing flat (apartment) {{complexes}} in Dublin have undergone some form of regeneration, from minor refurbishment to complete demolition and redevelopment. The context and impetus for such widespread regeneration has been the political articulation that social housing in Ireland, and especially in Dublin, is dysfunctional and unsustainable. It is contended, primarily {{on the basis of}} tenure mix arguments, that regeneration will lead to long-term social and environmental sustainability. Consequently, a number of inner city social housing complexes are currently subject to regeneration that involves their demolition and redevelopment as mixed-tenure estates through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) methods. This represents a new social and economic model of regeneration, albeit one which has generated considerable controversy. The process of regeneration has, for example, been criticised as lacking any meaningful community participation, with the mechanisms of the redevelopment process making it difficult for the community to influence the process. More generally, the creation of mixed <b>tenure</b> <b>estates</b> has been criticised as leading to a diminution of social housing in Dublin, as the social housing component in these estates has been significantly reduced. On the positive side, however, {{it has been argued that}} this model of social mixing will lead to sustainable regeneration. This paper, which is partly based on ongoing research of some case study estates in Dublin, examines and reflects on the issues of sustainable regeneration and the creation of sustainable communities. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} new perspective on the history of conservation in North America. In contrast to historiography that locates conservation-oriented approaches to the North American environment as the product of late-nineteenth-century concerns within Canada and the United States, this study links wildlife conservation in Quebec directly to longstanding European land <b>tenure,</b> <b>estate</b> management, and associational strategies. Through a range of materials including state documents, associational records and personal and family papers, I show how advocates of fish and game protection in the province drew heavily on Old World customs and traditions, particularly those of British landowners, who displayed in their varied social, economic, and political commitments an ongoing engagement with improvement. These 'patrician sensibilities,' I argue, formed the basis of the regulatory system that developed in Quebec during the period 1850 - 1914, first on the remote salmon rivers of the north shore and Gaspe peninsula, and by the First World War on the bulk of the province's best and most easily accessible hunting and fishing territories. In addition to the regulatory strategies that developed during this period, the dissertation deals with forms and limits of resistance on the part of aboriginal and non-aboriginal subsistence, commercial, and sport hunters and fishers. The dissertation's major contribution lies in its demonstration of the longstanding patterns that underpinned the development of conservation strategies in North America. Class and gender are central to the project, and it also has important implications for our understanding of civil society and state formation...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} feature of UK housing policy has been the promotion of consortia between local authorities, private developers and housing associations {{in order to develop}} mixed <b>tenure</b> <b>estates</b> to meet a wide range of housing needs. Central to this approach has been a focus on the management of neighbourhoods, {{based on the assumption that}} high densities and the inter-mixing of tenure exacerbates the potential for incivility and anti-social behaviour and exerts a disproportionate impact on residents' quality of life. Landlord strategies are therefore based on a need to address such issues at an early stage in the development. In some cases community-based, third sector organisations are established in order to manage community assets and to provide a community development service to residents. In others, a common response is to appoint caretakers and wardens to tackle social and environmental problems before they escalate and undermine residents’ quality of life. A number of innovative developments have promoted such neighbourhood governance approaches to housing practice by applying community development methods to address potential management problems. In the process, there is an increasing trend towards strategies that shape behaviour, govern ethical conduct, promote aesthetic standards and determine resident and landlord expectations. These processes can be related to the wider concept of governmentality whereby residents are encouraged to become actively engaged in managing their own environments, based on the assumption that this produces more cohesive, integrated communities and projects positive images. Evidence is emerging from a number of countries that increasingly integrated and mutually supportive roles and relationships between public, private and third sector agencies are transforming neighbourhood governance in similar ways. This paper will review the evidence for this trend towards community governance in mixed housing developments by drawing on a series of UK case studies prepared for two national agencies in 2007. It will review in particular the contractual arrangements with different tenures, identify codes and guidelines promoting 'good neighbour' behaviour and discuss the role of community development trusts and other neighbourhood organisations in providing facilities and services, designed to generate a well integrated community. The second part of the paper will review evidence from the USA and Australia to see how far there is a convergence in this respect in advanced economies. The paper will conclude by discussing the extent to which housing management practice is changing, particularly in areas of mixed development, whether there is a convergence in practice between different countries and how far these trends are supported by theories of governmentality...|$|R
