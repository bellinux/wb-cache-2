50|$|The two {{exhaust valves}} enabled the {{motorcycle}} to be fitted with two separate silencers. The motorcycle had both an electric start and a kick start which {{linked to an}} automatic <b>decompression</b> <b>valve</b> to reduce compression during operation. The fuel-efficient engine combined with the large fuel tank capacity provided the bike with a long range between refuelling.|$|E
50|$|A {{cartridge}} {{starting system}} is also fitted to the tractor. A shot-gun type blank cartridge is loaded into a breech on the engine's intake system. The smouldering paper {{is placed in}} the cylinder head, and the cartridge is fired by tapping the base of the protruding firing pin with a hammer. This puts a charge into the bore, sending the piston through its stroke, bursting into life. This method, however, deposits carbon which often causes jamming of the <b>decompression</b> <b>valve</b> if cartridges are regularly used. It also puts significantly more strain on the engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} then turned {{over with a}} {{starting}} handle placed in the starting dog on the flywheel. This is aided by the <b>decompression</b> <b>valve,</b> which decompresses the engine and {{makes it easier to}} turn over to allow the flywheel to gain speed and inertia to turn the engine through compression, and get the engine to fire. A spiral groove on the perimeter of the flywheel carries a wheel on the decompressor mechanism and is used to determine the number of revolutions before the decompressor disengages. This is generally up to 3 revolutions, but can be anything up to 6 revolutions. Depending on the condition and mood of individual tractors, it is possible to get a thorough workout starting the Marshall.|$|E
50|$|The smaller {{sustainer}} {{engines are}} usually not equipped with a throttle, but instead have a cable to open <b>decompression</b> <b>valves</b> in each cylinder to allow the engine to turn freely for starting. Sustainer engines are typically two-stroke two-cylinder air-cooled engines {{in the range of}} 18-30 hp (14-22 kW). They are lighter in weight, and simpler to operate than self-launching powerplants.|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} develop a novel {{approach}} to optimizing continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) function and diagnosing device malfunctions. BackgroundIn CF-LVAD patients, the dynamic interaction of device speed, left and right ventricular <b>decompression,</b> and <b>valve</b> function can be assessed during an echocardiography-monitored speed ramp test. MethodsWe devised a unique ramp test protocol to be routinely used {{at the time of}} discharge for speed optimization and/or if device malfunction was suspected. The patient's left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, frequency of aortic valve opening, valvular insufficiency, blood pressure, and CF-LVAD parameters were recorded in increments of 400 rpm from 8, 000 rpm to 12, 000 rpm. The results of the speed designations were plotted, and linear function slopes for left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, pulsatility index, and power were calculated. ResultsFifty-two ramp tests for 39 patients were prospectively collected and analyzed. Twenty-eight ramp tests were performed for speed optimization, and speed was changed in 17 (61 %) with a mean absolute value adjustment of 424 ± 211 rpm. Seventeen patients had ramp tests performed for suspected device thrombosis, and 10 tests were suspicious for device thrombosis; these patients were then treated with intensified anticoagulation and/or device exchange/emergent transplantation. Device thrombosis was confirmed in 8 of 10 cases at the time of emergent device exchange or transplantation. All patients with device thrombosis, but none of the remaining patients had a left ventricular end-diastolic dimension slope >− 0. 16. ConclusionsRamp tests facilitate optimal speed changes and device malfunction detection and may be used to monitor the effects of therapeutic interventions and need for surgical intervention in CF-LVAD patients...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS), {{the presence of}} right ventricular to coronary communications (RVCC) dictates surgical management (right ventricular (RV) <b>decompression).</b> Previously, tricuspid <b>valve</b> annulus size-Z score (TV-Z), and RV morphology {{have been used to}} predict the presence of RVCC. We hypothesize that pulmonary infundibular diameter better predicts the presence of RVCC than TV-Z score. MethodsFrom 2 / 91 to 7 / 94, 24 neonates with PA/IVS referred to our institution were studied (6 of which were prospectively evaluated). Four were excluded: 1 with associated Ebstein's anomaly and 3 with incomplete data. In the remaining 20 pts., echocardiographic measurements of the TV annulus and infundibular diameter were made, and angiograms were reviewed for the presence and extent of RVCC. Statistical analysis was performed using a two tailed student's t test. ResultsEleven pts with RVCC had significantly smaller infundibular diameter (2. 3 ± 07 –mm) than nine pts without RVCC(6. 5 ± 1. 6 –mm), P 5. 0 –mm. While, the TV Z-score was also significantly smaller: – 3. 52 ± 1. 3 vs. – 0. 76 ± 1. 0, respectively, p< 0. 001, there was significant overlap between the groups. In all six cases studied prospectively, the presence of RVCC was predicted correctly, using the infundibular diameter. ConclusionThe infundibular diameter measured by Echo accurately predicts the presence of RV-coronary communications in neonates with PA/IVS. This method better distinguishes {{the presence or absence of}} RVCC than TV-Z score...|$|R
