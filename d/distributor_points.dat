Use of a feeler gauge with flat blades instead of round wires, as is used on <b>distributor</b> <b>points</b> or valve lash, will give {{erroneous}} results, due to the shape of spark plug electrodes. The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{management}} of the spare parts in the automotive sector introducing a first definition of business model aimed to reduce holding costs of stocks, focusing on spare parts <b>distributors</b> <b>point</b> of view, and adopting a probabilistic mathematical approach. The management of spare parts is not trivial due to the infrequent profile that characterizes market demand, in contrast with the necessity of the distributors to keep in stock a large number of items (part numbers) in order to avoid lost sales (back ordering is not allowed). Moreover, given that different distributors can deal the same products among the national market, the total amount of stocks of the same products is multiplied along the supply chain. A mathematical approach adopting probabilistic dynamic programming is presented aimed to optimize the management of spare parts, considering the creation of a platform in which different distributors can participate to share the management of items. The main purpose of the model is to find the optimal allocation of products among distributors and, at the same time, ensuring a balancing in the costs that each player has to bear period by period, providing the optimal reorder policy for each product.

40|$|Drip-fertigated {{systems have}} {{variable}} distributions {{of water and}} nutrients in the soil, which influence soil microbial activity. Because {{there is a lack}} of data on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes for these systems, a field experiment comparing drip irrigation systems (fertigated and non-fertigated) was carried out in a melon crop. For the fertigated treatment, nitrogen (N) as NH 4 NO 3 was dissolved in irrigation water and split into six applications (Fertigation treatment). In the non-fertigated soil (ANS treatment), granular NH 4 NO 3 was incorporated homogeneously into the upper part of soil surface at planting. A control treatment without N fertilizer was also included. In order to evaluate the pattern of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4), measurements were made at six different distances from the irrigation <b>distributor</b> <b>point</b> (dripper). An additional field experiment with N- 15 -labelled N fertilizer was carried out in parallel, with the aim of evaluating the contribution of nitrification and denitrification to the total N 2 O flux. Two different sources of N- 15 were applied: (NH 4 NO 3) -N- 15 (20 at% excess N- 15) ((NH 4 +) -N- 15 treatment, TR 1) and (NH 4 NO 3) -N- 15 (20 at% excess(15) N) ((NO 3 -) -N- 15 treatment, TR 2). Results indicated that both treatments (ANS and Fertigation) had small emission fluxes of N 2 O (< 0. 1 % of N applied). However, Fertigation produced larger emissions (175. 3 g N 2 O-N ha(- 1)) than ANS (90. 1 g N 2 O N ha(- 1)), with the pattern of N 2 O emission being strongly influenced by nitrification in both systems. Denitrification also contributed to emissions of (N 2 O) -N- 15 but mainly on the day after fertilizer application in the Fertigation treatment. Methane fluxes were also affected by N fertilizer, with a decrease in the sink effect for CH 4 when NH 4 + was present in the soil...|$|R

40|$|Automotive Resources, Inc. (ARI) has {{developed}} a new device for igniting fuel in engines-the SmartPlug. TM SmartPlug is a self-contained ignition system that may be retrofitted to existing spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines. The SmartPlug needs as little as six watts of power for warm-up, and requires no electricity at all when the engine is running. Unlike traditional spark plugs, once the SmartPlug ignites the engine, and the engine heats up, the power supply for the plug is no longer necessary. In the utility industry, SmartPlugs {{can be used in}} tractors, portable generators, compressors, and pumps. In addition to general-purpose applications, such as lawn mowers and chainsaws, SmartPlugs can also be used in the recreational, marine, aviation, and automotive industries. Unlike traditional ignition systems, the SmartPlug system requires no <b>distributor,</b> coil <b>points,</b> or moving parts. SmartPlugs are non-fouling, with a faster and cleaner burn than traditional spark plugs. They prevent detonation and are not sensitive to moisture, allowing them to be used on a variety of engines. Other advantages include no electrical noise, no high voltage, exceptionally high altitude capabilities, and better cold-start statistics than those of standard spark ignition systems. Future applications for the SmartPlug are being evaluated by manufacturers in the snowmobile industry...|$|R

50|$|The {{wide and}} large port heads with {{staggered}} valve placement give the Boss 302 high power capabilities. Because of the pent-roof {{design of the}} heads, the Boss also had forged pop-up pistons to achieve the desired 10.5:1 compression ratio. Early units were typically characterized by very large intake (2.23 inches) and exhaust (1.70 inches) valves sitting in a small quench style combustion chamber. Exhaust valves were sodium-filled to aid cooling. Valve springs were dual units with an inner and outer spring to minimize harmonic resonance at high RPM. The heads feature steel spring seats, screw-in rocker studs, pushrod guide plates to aid in pushrod stability at high RPMs, and adjustable rocker arms. Fuel was provided by a Holly 780cfm manual choke carburetor. The taller intake required a thinner spacer.
