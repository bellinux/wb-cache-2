5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin <b>foetuses</b> to engage {{in some form of}} social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten <b>foetuses</b> were analyzed {{over a period of time}} using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin <b>foetuses</b> would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E
5|$|The textual {{description}} of Matrikas is generally awesome, frightening and ferocious. In the Mahabharata, all the seven mothers {{are described as}} fatal or serve as threats to <b>foetuses</b> or infants. They are described as living in trees, crossroads, caves and funeral grounds and they are terrible as well as beautiful. But, in the sculptural portrayal, they are depicted quite differently as protectors and benevolent mothers. They are armed with the same weapons, wear the same ornaments, and ride the same vahanas and carry the same banners as their corresponding male deities.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the {{characterisation}} of Shashthi {{underwent a}} gradual evolution. Aforementioned folk traditions originating between the 10th and 5th centuries BCE associated the goddess with {{both positive and}} negative elements of fertility, birth, motherhood and childhood. However, between the 4th century BCE and the 5th century CE, a shift occurred in which Shashthi was increasingly depicted as a malevolent deity associated with the sufferings of mothers and children. The fifth century text Kashyapa Samhita calls Shashthi by the epithet Jataharini ("one who steals the born") and provides a list of the malevolent activities in which Shashthi is believed to engage, including her practice of stealing <b>foetuses</b> from the womb and devouring children on the sixth day following birth. For this reason, the text recommends that she be propitiated through worship in her honour on this day in the lying-in room and on the sixth day of every fortnight thereafter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In recent years, the {{protozoan}} Tritrichomonas <b>foetus</b> {{has been}} recognised {{as an important}} cause of chronic large-bowel diarrhoea in purebred cats in many countries, including Norway. The aim of this cross-sectional {{study was to determine}} the proportion of animals with T. <b>foetus</b> infection among clinically healthy cats in Norway and to assess different risk factors for T. <b>foetus</b> infection, such as age, sex, former history of gastrointestinal symptoms and concurrent infections with Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium sp. Methods The sample population consisted of 52 cats participating in three cat shows in Norway in 2009. Samples were examined for motile T. <b>foetus</b> by microscopy, after culturing and for T. <b>foetus</b> -DNA by species-specific nested PCR, as well as for Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts by immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Results By PCR, T. <b>foetus</b> -DNA was demonstrated in the faeces of 11 (21 %) of the 52 cats tested. DNA-sequencing of five positive samples yielded 100 % identity with previous isolates of T. <b>foetus</b> from cats. Only one sample was positive for T. <b>foetus</b> by microscopy. By IFAT, four samples were positive for Giardia cysts and one for Cryptosporidium oocysts, none of which was co-infected with T. <b>foetus.</b> No significant associations were found between the presence of T. <b>foetus</b> and the various risk factors examined. Conclusions T. <b>foetus</b> was found to be a common parasite in clinically healthy cats in Norway. </p...|$|R
25|$|In 1994 the Indian {{government}} {{passed a}} law forbidding women or their families from asking about {{the sex of the}} baby after an ultrasound scan (or any other test which would yield that information) and also expressly forbade doctors or any other persons from providing that information.

25|$|Dexamethasone {{has also}} been used during {{pregnancy}} as an off-label prenatal treatment for the symptoms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in female fetuses. CAH causes a variety of physical abnormalities, notably ambiguous genitalia in girls. Early prenatal CAH treatment {{has been shown to}} reduce some CAH symptoms, but it does not treat the underlying congenital disorder. This use is controversial: it is inadequately studied, only around one in ten of the <b>foetuses</b> of women treated are at risk of the condition, and serious adverse events have been documented. Experimental use of dexamethasone in pregnancy for foetal CAH treatment was discontinued in Sweden when one in five cases suffered adverse events.|$|E

These findings force us to predate the emergence of social behavior: when the context enables it, {{as in the case of}} twin <b>foetuses,</b> other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.".|$|E

500|$|Reproduction in the finless sleeper ray is viviparous, {{with the}} embryos {{sustained}} through gestation by a yolk sac.

500|$|The {{most common}} foetus that is aborted in India is a female one. [...] Numerous factors {{contribute}} to the abortion of female <b>foetuses.</b> For example, women who are highly educated and had a first-born female child {{are the most likely}} to abort a female. The act of sex-selective abortion has contributed to a skewed male to female ratio. As of the 2011 census, the sex ratio among children aged 0–6 continued a long trend towards more males.|$|E
500|$|Between {{the years}} of 1991 to 2001, the female-male ratio of the {{population}} of India fell from 94.5 girls per 100 boys to 92.7 girls per 100 boys.

This is evidence of natality inequality, and an indication that sex-selective abortion has become more pervasive.

This prospective, multi-institutional, cross sectional study examines the occurrence of T <b>foetus</b> and other enteric parasites in cattery-housed and shelter cats within Australia, where T <b>foetus</b> has only recently been identified. Faecal specimens were collected from 134 cats, including 82 cattery-housed pedigree cats and 52 shelter cats. Faecal examinations performed for most cats included concentration techniques, Snap Giardia test, culture in InPouch medium, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of T <b>foetus</b> ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes using species-specific primers. Observed occurrence of T <b>foetus,</b> Giardia species, Isospora species and Toxascaris leonina for cattery-housed cats (and catteries) were 0 %, 7. 4 (13. 8) %, 10. 9 (22. 6) % and 1. 6 (3. 2) %, respectively.

2500|$|A 1978 study {{examined}} the effect of sunlight on folate – a vitamin B complex – levels. The study found that even short periods of intense sunlight are able to halve folate levels if someone has light skin. Low folate levels are correlated with neural tube defects, such as anencephaly and spina bifida. UV rays can strip away folate, which {{is important to the}} development of healthy <b>foetuses.</b> In these abnormalities children are born with incomplete brain or spinal cord. Nina Jablonski, a professor of anthropology and expert on evolution of human skin coloration, [...] found several cases in which mother’s visits to tanning studios were connected to neural tube defects in early pregnancy.

2500|$|It is also {{possible}} for direct transmission between hosts. [...] Larvae having accessed through the skin may avoid exit via the lungs and remain in circulation for transport around the body. [...] At the uterine artery of a pregnant female the larvae are able to cross the placenta to cause pre-natal infection of <b>foetuses.</b> [...] Larvae of an infected foetus will move to the liver until birth at which point migration continues with movement to the intestine via the circulation and lungs as previously described. [...] Alternatively A. caninum larvae evading exit from the circulation at the lungs may instead be carried to the mammary glands and transmitted from the mother in her colostrum or milk to her pups; infection then proceeds in an identical manner to infection by ingestion from the environment. [...] Infected bitches {{have been found to}} only rarely give prenatal transmission to pups while the likelihood of nursing of pups causing transmission (via the lactational route) is much higher.|$|E

6000|$|Since then it {{is evident}} that we sort and name {{substances}} by their nominal and not by their real essences, the next thing to be considered is how, and by whom these essences come to be made. As to the latter, it is evident they are made by the mind, and not by nature: for were they Nature's workmanship, they could not be so various and different in several men as experience tells us they are. For if we will examine it, we shall not find the nominal essence of any one species of substances in all men the same: no, not of that which of all others we are the most intimately acquainted with. It could not possibly be that the abstract idea to which the name MAN is given should be different in several men, if it were of Nature's making; and that to one it should be animal rationale, and to another, animal implume bipes latis unguibus. He that annexes the name man to a complex idea, made up of sense and spontaneous motion, joined to a body of such a shape, has thereby one essence of the species man; and he that, upon further examination, adds rationality, has another essence of the species he calls man: by which means the same individual will be a true man to the one which is not so to the other. I think there is scarce any one will allow this upright figure, so well known, to be the essential difference of the species man; and yet how far men determine of the sorts of animals rather by their shape than descent, is very visible; since it has been more than once debated, whether several human <b>foetuses</b> should be preserved or received to baptism or no, only because of the difference of their outward configuration from the ordinary make of children, without knowing whether they were not as capable of reason as infants cast in another mould: some whereof, though of an approved shape, are never capable of as much appearance of reason all their lives as {{is to be found in}} an ape, or an elephant, and never give any signs of being acted by a rational soul. Whereby it is evident, that the outward figure, which only was found wanting, and not the faculty of reason, which nobody could know would be wanting in its due season, was made essential to the human species. The learned divine and lawyer must, on such occasions, renounce his sacred definition of animal rationale, and substitute some other essence of the human species. [Monsieur Menage furnishes us with an example worth the taking notice of on this occasion: 'When the abbot of Saint Martin,' says he, 'was born, he had so little of the figure of a man, that it bespake him rather a monster. It was for some time under deliberation, whether he should be baptized or no. However, he was baptized, and declared a man provisionally [till time should show what he would prove]. Nature had moulded him so untowardly, that he was called all his life the Abbot Malotru; i.e. ill-shaped. He was of Caen. (Menagiana, 278, 430.) This child, we see, was very near being excluded out of the species of man, barely by his shape. He escaped very narrowly as he was; and it is certain, a figure a little more oddly turned had cast him, and he had been executed, as a thing not to be allowed to pass for a man. And yet there can be no reason given why, if the lineaments of his face had been a little altered, a rational soul could not have been lodged in him; why a visage somewhat longer, or a nose flatter, or a wider mouth, could not have consisted, as well as the rest of his ill figure, with such a soul, such parts, as made him, disfigured as he was, capable to be a dignitary in the church.] ...|$|E
