40|$|Excerpt] This Beyond the Numbers article compares {{relative}} <b>importances</b> {{based on}} data collected during three periods that can be characterized roughly as boom, recession, and recovery. The “recovery” era {{is represented by the}} current CPI relative <b>importances,</b> which are based on surveys conducted in 2011 – 2012. These relative <b>importances</b> replaced figures that were {{based on data}} collected during 2009 – 2010, and represent the “recession” period. (While the economy was recovering at least during the latter part of this period, it seems reasonable to expect consumer behavior to reflect recession conditions.) Because the 2007 – 2008 period was one of transition from boom to recession, we will examine the weights based on 2005 – 2006 data, as representing spending during a booming economy...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new perceptual metric for efficient, high quality, global illumination rendering. The metric {{is based on a}} rendering-by-components framework in which the direct, and indirect diffuse, glossy, and specular light transport paths are separately computed and then composited to produce an image. The metric predicts the perceptual <b>importances</b> of the computationally expensive indirect illumination components with respect to image quality. To develop the metric we conducted a series of psychophysical experiments in which we measured and modeled the perceptual <b>importances</b> of the components. An important property of this new metric is that it predicts component <b>importances</b> from inexpensive estimates of the reflectance properties of a scene, and therefore adds negligible overhead to the rendering process. This perceptual metric should enable the development of an important new class of efficient global-illumination rendering systems that can intelligently allocate limited computational resources, to provide high quality images at interactive rates...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To explore {{factors related}} to {{emergency}} department (ED) attendances in Hong Kong, the authors piloted the application of conjoint analysis in eliciting patient preferences regarding ED visits. Methods: The study recruited 390 semi-urgent or non-urgent patients from a targeted convenience sample of three large EDs. Respondents were asked to rank eight scenarios structured to explore the relative <b>importances</b> of three key attributes - self-perceived illness severity, waiting time, and consultation fee - that may result in an ED visit. Results: Seventy-eight {{percent of the respondents}} would consider visiting a parallel clinic instead of the ED for semi-urgent and non-urgent conditions. The relative <b>importances</b> attached to illness severity, waiting time, and consultation fee were 47. 8 %, 33. 6 %, and 18. 7 %, respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that Hong Kong patients are receptive to the concept of parallel clinics, and illustrated that conjoint analysis is a rigorous survey technique for eliciting the views of patients on health care services in the ED setting. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
