The author of the Letters from the North of Scotland, an officer of engineers, quartered at Inverness about 1720, who certainly cannot be deemed a <b>favorable</b> <b>witness,</b> gives the following account of the office, and of a bard, whom he heard exercise his talent of recitation:--'The bard is killed in the genealogy of all the Highland families, sometimes preceptor to the young laird, celebrates in Irish verse the original of the tribe, the famous warlike actions of the successive heads, and sings his own lyricks as an opiate to the chief, when indisposed for sleep; but poets are not equally esteemed and honored in all countries. I {{happened to be a}} witness of the dishonour done to the muse, at the house of one of the chiefs, where two of these bards were set at a good distance, {{at the lower end of}} a long table, with a parcel of Highlanders of no extraordinary appearance, over a cup of ale. Poor inspiration! They were not asked to drink a glass of wine at our table, though the whole company consisted only of the great man, one of his near relations, and myself. After some little time, the chief ordered one of them to sing me a Highland song. The bard readily obeyed, and with a hoarse voice, and in a tune of few various notes, began, as I was told, one of his own lyricks; and when he had proceeded to the fourth of fifth stanza, I perceived, by the names of several persons, glens, and mountains, which I had known or heard of before, that it was an account of some clan battle. But in his going on, the chief (who piques himself upon his school-learning) at some particular passage, bid him cease, and cryed out, [...] "There's nothing like that in Virgil or Homer." [...] I bowed, and told him I believed so. This you may believe was very edifying and delightful'" [...] (Scott).|$|E
5|$|The Compulsory Process Clause {{guarantees}} the defendant {{the right to}} obtain <b>favorable</b> <b>witnesses</b> at trial. For example, the Clause prevents a jurisdiction from precluding defendants from calling their codefendants as witnesses. Similarly, the Clause prevents the government from deporting a witness whose testimony would have been both material and favorable to the defense. The right does not pre-empt reasonable procedural rules. Thus, the right does not prevent the preclusion of defense witnesses as a discovery sanction.|$|R

This prevents a lawyer from feeding answers to a <b>favorable</b> <b>witness.</b> An {{exception to this}} rule occurs if one side has called a witness, but it is either understood, or becomes clear, that the witness is hostile to the questioner's side of the controversy. The lawyer may then ask the court to declare the person {{he or she has}} called to the stand a hostile witness. If the court does so, the lawyer may thereafter ask witness leading questions during direct examination.|$|E

Once seated in the House, Yulee worked to gain statehood for the territory and to protect the expansion of slavery in new states.|$|R

The adversarial nature of criminal courts in the United States and the United Kingdom promotes a confrontational dynamic between competing attorneys that many have argued is detrimental {{to the pursuit of}} truth and justice. Of greatest concern are the questioning strategies used by attorneys—especially during cross-examination—which may be considered coercive, confusing and intimidating to witnesses. The literature suggests that these strategies not only affect the accuracy of witness testimony, but also alter the perception of fact-finders. <b>Witnesses</b> <b>favorable</b> to truth and justice may have both their testimony and credibility damaged by attorneys skilled in the art of language. This literature review questions the confounding effects of adversarial questioning strategies on truth and justice, and investigates whether the way in which witnesses are questioned in court ought to be revised.

This study aims to determine in terms of what a defendant presents a <b>favorable</b> <b>witness</b> and if there are any obstacles to the defendant in an effort to call favorable witnesses. Kind of research is a normative legal research, which focuses on the positive legal norms in the form of legislation. The study was conducted in Sleman District Court.

The defendant also have other problems because the witnesses to be filed afraid to be witnesses or witnesses experiencing economic problems because the witness is located away from the office of the court which will judge the case concerned, so he can not be present at the court and the defendant also have problems because law enforcement officers do restrictions to call witnesses favorable...|$|E
