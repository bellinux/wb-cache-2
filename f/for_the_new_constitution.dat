5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{opposition}} to slavery, Garrard did not take a particularly {{active role in the}} convention's proceedings. His most notable action not related to slavery occurred on April 13, 1792, when he reported twenty-two resolutions from the committee of the whole that provided the framework <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{nominated}} Andrew T. Wood, {{a lawyer}} from Mount Sterling, who had failed in earlier elections for Congress and state attorney general. Concurrently with the gubernatorial election, the state's voters would {{decide whether to}} ratify a proposed new constitution for the state in 1891. The divided Democrats had taken no stand on the document {{as part of their}} convention's platform, and Wood spent much of the campaign trying to get Brown to declare his support for or opposition to it. About six weeks before the election, Brown, sensing strong public support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution,</b> finally came out in favor of it. For the remainder of the race, Wood touted an alleged conspiracy between Brown and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to thwart meaningful corporate regulations, but the issue failed to gain much traction.|$|E
25|$|On 28 September 1958, a {{referendum}} took place and 79.2 {{percent of those}} who voted supported the new constitution and the creation of the Fifth Republic. The colonies (Algeria was officially a part of France, not a colony) were given the choice between immediate independence and the new constitution. All African colonies voted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> and the replacement of the French Union by the French Community, except Guinea, which thus became the first French African colony to gain independence and immediately lost all French assistance.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the coup}} of 22 January 1798 did {{not bode well}} for a {{genuinely}} democratic approval process <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> (and the French would have preferred going the [...] "safe" [...] way of approval by the rump assembly) the plebiscite that started on 17 March (in the usual form of elections in [...] "primary" [...] assemblies of about 100-500 voters) had a reasonably democratic quality. On 23 April 1798, the Staatsregeling voor het Bataafsche Volk was approved with 153,913 votes against 11,587 (i.e. just 641 more people voted for approval in 1798 than had voted for rejection of the previous draft in 1797; about 50% of the electorate had voted.) The new regime therefore seemed well-grounded in the new doctrine of popular sovereignty.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} in the Uitvoerend Bewind (Gerrit Pijman in particular) therefore amended the project {{in a sense that}} gave re-federalization even more emphasis. They unilaterally convened the primary assemblies by a proclamation on 14 September 1801, have a referendum on this new draft constitution. The Assembly defiantly ruled this proclamation illegal on 18 September. Then General Augereau (he of the Fructidor-coup), now commander-in-chief of the French forces in the Netherlands, routinely closed the doors of the Assembly (by previous arrangement with Pijman) on 19 September, and arrested the dissident Directors. Despite this military putsch the campaign for the plebiscite took place in an atmosphere of political freedom unthinkable in France. Nevertheless, this did not result in great enthusiasm <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution.</b> When the votes were counted on 1 October, out of 416,619 voters only 16,771 voted in favor and 52,219 against. The Directors then used a sleight of hand that unfortunately would also become familiar in the Dutch constitutional politics of the successor states: they counted the 350,000 abstentions as [...] "tacit affirmations".|$|E

2500|$|In June 2013, a Parliamentary Committee {{tasked with}} {{reviewing}} the Constitution attempted to ban same-sex marriage by voting an amendment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Constitution,</b> making marriage possible only [...] "between {{a man and}} a woman". Green Party MP Remus Cernea, which is a staunch supporter of LGBT right and which has since introduced a draft law to the Senate in order to legalize civil unions, thinks of the move as a [...] "clear a democratic setback; Romania should now be included among the most homophobic countries in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trudeau {{announced}} {{his belief that}} the premiers were dealing in bad faith and met with his caucus to propose a new course. After offering {{a wide range of}} options and proposing full reform, a Quebec MP shouted [...] "Allons-y en Cadillac!" [...] (translated by Trudeau to mean [...] "let's go first class ... be liberal to the end ... not to temper our convictions with political expediency"). Taking the proposal to Cabinet, some ministers suggested using the maneuver to increase federal power over the economy, but Trudeau demurred, replying [...] "we shouldn't upset the balance". On October 2, 1980, he announced on national television his intention to proceed with unilateral patriation in what he termed the [...] "people's package". The proposal would request patriation from the UK parliament, as well as the entrenchment of a charter of rights, and would call for a referendum to be held within two years on the amending formula <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution,</b> which would be a choice between the Victoria Charter veto formula and any joint proposal by the provinces that could be approved by provinces totalling 80% of the population.|$|E

50|$|The crisis deepened after Kurds {{were denied}} {{seats in the}} {{assembly}} of experts gathering in 1979, which were responsible <b>for</b> writing <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution.</b> Ayatollah Khomeini prevented Dr. Ghassemlou, the elected representative of the region, {{to participate in the}} assembly of experts’ first meeting. Kurds were therefore deprived of their political rights under <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Iranian <b>constitution,</b> since <b>the</b> majority of them belonged to the Sunni branch of Islam.|$|R

50|$|In 1986, {{he became}} Head of Indigenous Affairs and advisor to President Virgilio Barco Vargas (1986-1990). This {{provided}} an important foothold for encouraging government policy favorable to indigenous rights.

2500|$|As Prince of Monaco, Rainier {{was also}} {{responsible}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> principality's <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> in 1962 which significantly reduced {{the power of}} the sovereign.

50|$|The work {{took less}} than two weeks. A {{complete}} constitutional document was submitted to the Convention on 10 June 1793.

5000|$|The {{party was}} {{originally}} established by Joseph Ki-Zerbo in Dakar in Senegal in August 1958.

50|$|Later that year, Carranza held {{elections}} for the presidency. Alvaro Obregón, Carranza's best general and a reformist who pushed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution,</b> was to oppose him for the seat. Carranza orchestrated a sham election, allowing Ignacio Bonillas to win. Carranza then fled to Guerrero where he staged a short coup to bring him into the presidency but was killed on horseback while fleeing from Mexico City to Veracruz.|$|E
50|$|Dunn {{also worked}} {{at the state level}} as adviser to Indiana {{governor}} Thomas R.
