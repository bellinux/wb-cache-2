Measurements of <b>inline</b> <b>image,</b> <b>inline</b> <b>image,</b> and irradiance (E) can be scaled to derive photosynthetic electron transport rates (<b>inline</b> <b>image),</b> the process that fuels phytoplankton carbon fixation and growth. Bio-optical estimates of <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> and <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> were evaluated using 10 phytoplankton cultures across different pigment groups with varying bio-optical absorption characteristics on six different fast-repetition rate fluorometers that span two different manufacturers and four different models. Culture measurements of <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> and the effective absorption cross section of PSII photochemistry (<b>inline</b> <b>image,</b> a constituent of <b>inline</b> <b>image)</b> showed {{a high degree of}} correspondence across instruments, although some instrument-specific biases are identified.

With the exception of ex situ <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> estimates from paired <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> and PSII reaction center concentration (<b>inline</b> <b>image)</b> measurements, the accuracy and precision of in situ <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> methodologies are largely determined by the variance of method-specific coefficients.

40|$|New Findings What is {{the central}} {{question}} of this study? The finding that pulmonary oxygen uptake (<b>inline</b> <b>image)</b> kinetics on transition to moderate exercise is invariant and exponential {{is consistent with a}} first-order reaction controlling <b>inline</b> <b>image.</b> However, slowed <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> kinetics when initiating exercise from raised baseline intensities challenges this notion. What is the main finding and its importance? Here, we demonstrate how a first-order system can respond with non-first-order response dynamics. Data suggest that progressive recruitment of muscle fibre populations having progressively lower mitochondrial density and slower microvascular blood flow kinetics can unify the seemingly contradictory evidence for the control of <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> on transition to exercise. We examined the relationship amongst baseline work rate (WR), phase II pulmonary oxygen uptake (<b>inline</b> <b>image)</b> time constant (<b>inline</b> <b>image)</b> and functional gain <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> during moderate-intensity exercise. Transitions were initiated from a constant or variable baseline WR. A validated circulatory model was used to examine the role of heterogeneity in muscle metabolism (<b>inline</b> <b>image)</b> and blood flow (<b>inline</b> <b>image)</b> in determining <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> kinetics. We hypothesized that <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> and GP would be invariant in the constant baseline condition but would increase linearly with increased baseline WR. Fourteen men completed three to five repetitions of ∆ 40 W step transitions initiated from 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 W on a cycle ergometer. The ∆ 40 W step transitions from 60, 80, 100 and 120 W were preceded by 6 min of 20 W cycling, from which the progressive ΔWR transitions (constant baseline condition) were examined. The <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> was measured breath by breath using mass spectrometry and a volume turbine. For a given ΔWR, both <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> (22 – 35 s) and GP (8. 7 – 10. 5 ml min− 1 W− 1) increased (P < 0. 05) linearly as a function of baseline WR (20 – 120 W). The <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> was invariant (P < 0. 05) in transitions initiated from 20 W, but GP increased with ΔWR (P < 0. 05). Modelling the summed influence of multiple muscle compartments revealed that <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> could appear fast (24 s), and similar to in vivo measurements (22 ± 6 s), despite being derived from <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> values with a range of 15 – 40 s and <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> with a range of 20 – 45 s, suggesting that within the moderate-intensity domain phase II <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> kinetics are slowed dependent on the pretransition WR and are strongly influenced by muscle metabolic and circulatory heterogeneity...|$|E

40|$|Let G be {{a simple}} undirected {{connected}} graph on n vertices with maximum degree Δ. Brooks' Theorem states that G has a proper Δ-coloring unless G is a complete graph, or a cycle with an odd number of vertices. To recolor G is to obtain a new proper coloring by changing the color of one vertex. We show an analogue of Brooks' Theorem by proving that from any k-coloring, <b>inline</b> <b>image,</b> a Δ-coloring of G {{can be obtained by}} a sequence of <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> recolorings using only the original k colors unless – G is a complete graph or a cycle with an odd number of vertices, or – <b>inline</b> <b>image,</b> G is Δ-regular and, for each vertex v in G, no two neighbors of v are colored alike. We use this result to study the reconfiguration graph <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> of the k-colorings of G. The vertex set of <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> is the set of all possible k-colorings of G and two colorings are adjacent if they differ on exactly one vertex.

40|$|For dose–response {{analysis}} in quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), the exact beta-Poisson {{model is a}} two-parameter mechanistic dose–response model with parameters <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> and <b>inline</b> <b>image,</b> which involves the Kummer confluent hypergeometric function. Evaluation of a hypergeometric function is a computational challenge. Denoting <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> as the probability of infection at a given mean dose d, the widely used dose–response model <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> is an approximate formula for the exact beta-Poisson model. Notwithstanding the required conditions <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> and <b>inline</b> <b>image,</b> {{issues related to the}} validity and approximation accuracy of this approximate formula have remained largely ignored in practice, partly because these conditions are too general to provide clear guidance. Consequently, this study proposes a probability measure Pr(0 0. 99). This validity measure and rule of thumb were validated by application to all the completed beta-Poisson models (related to 85 data sets) from the QMRA community portal (QMRA Wiki). The results showed that the higher the probability Pr(0 < r < 1 | <b>inline</b> <b>image,</b> <b>inline</b> <b>image),</b> the better the approximation.

40|$|The first isotope-enabled general {{circulation}} model (GCM) simulations of the Pliocene {{are used to}} discuss the interpretation of δ 18 O measurements for a warm climate. The model suggests that spatial patterns of Pliocene ocean surface δ 18 O (<b>inline</b> <b>image)</b> {{were similar to those}} of the preindustrial period; however, Arctic and coastal regions were relatively depleted, while South Atlantic and Mediterranean regions were relatively enriched. Modeled <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> anomalies are closely related to modeled salinity anomalies, which supports using <b>inline</b> <b>image</b> as a paleosalinity proxy. Modeled Pliocene precipitation δ 18 O (<b>inline</b> <b>image)</b> was enriched relative to the preindustrial values (but with depletion of < 2 ‰ over some tropical regions). While usually modest (< 4 ‰), the enrichment can reach 25 ‰ over ice sheet regions.
