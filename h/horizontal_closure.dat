30|$|Interaction {{between the}} solar wind and the Earth’s {{magnetosphere}} is associated with large-scale currents in the ionosphere at polar latitudes that flow along magnetic field lines (Birkeland currents) and horizontally. These current systems are tightly linked, but their global behaviors are rarely analyzed together. In this paper, we present estimates of the average global Birkeland currents and horizontal ionospheric currents from {{the same set of}} magnetic field measurements. The magnetic field measurements, from the low Earth orbiting Swarm and CHAMP satellites, are used to co-estimate poloidal and toroidal parts of the magnetic disturbance field, represented in magnetic apex coordinates. The use of apex coordinates reduces effects of longitudinal and hemispheric variations in the Earth’s main field. We present global currents from both hemispheres during different sunlight conditions. The results show that the Birkeland currents vary with the conductivity, which depends most strongly on solar EUV emissions on the dayside and on particle precipitation at pre-midnight magnetic local times. In sunlight, the horizontal equivalent current flows in two cells, resembling an opposite ionospheric convection pattern, which implies that it is dominated by Hall currents. By combining the Birkeland current maps and the equivalent current, we are able to calculate the total horizontal current, without any assumptions about the conductivity. We show that the total horizontal current is close to zero in the polar cap when it is dark. That implies that the equivalent current, which is sensed by ground magnetometers, is largely canceled by the <b>horizontal</b> <b>closure</b> of the Birkeland currents.|$|E
40|$|Wireline Mini-Fracture testing jobs {{consist of}} a short duration, small volume {{fracturing}} operation inside an open-hole borehole, where {{a certain amount of}} fluid is injected into the formation at constant rate using a Wireline Modular conveyed tool as a source of hydraulic power to pressurize the wellbore. The tool is configured with an inflatable straddle packer and an internal pump, which inflate/deflates the packers and supplies pressure to the formation until a hydraulic fracture is induced. This procedure is used to determine in–situ formation breakdown and closure pressure also known as minimum <b>horizontal</b> <b>closure</b> pressure. This provides vital information regarding hydraulic fracture design, water and gas injection management, fault re-activation, wellbore stability, sand production, rock mechanical properties, casing string design, cap and base rock integrity and gas storage design. Geomechanical and operational parameters such as, elastic properties, poro-elasticity, rock strength, formation pore pressure, far field horizontal stress, permeability/porosity distributions, borehole fluid properties among others, influences the performance of the Mini-Frac Jobs. In many cases poor understanding of the reservoir response to the fracture process, caused that the hydraulic fracture did not propagate deep into the formation. In other cases the pressure applied to the formation might be insufficient to break down the formation, leading to unsatisfactory application of the Mini-Fracture technique in the process. The objective of this thesis is to develop a Mini-Facture application simulator that uses the geomechanical and operational parameters that control the performance of a Mini-Fracture job and estimate the possibility of the occurrence of a tensile failure in the formation. The simulator is then validated by comparing its output with the results of stress test done in the field. With this simulator petrotechnical professionals and field engineers will have a platform that simulates the pressure responses and fracture initialization during Mini-Frac treatments, incorporating all the variables affecting a Wireline Mini-Fracture job, helping the design engineer to make key decisions about the ultimate or required fracture plan. Furthermore the simulator will reduce the uncertainties that limit the reliability of the Wireline Mini-Fracture treatment by allowing the selection of appropriate tool configuration based on the job objectives and the geological environmental conditions. Finally this project demonstrates that combining the appropriate constitutive relations that reflect the coupling among the tool operational performance with wellbore flow, reservoir and geomechanics modelling a Mini-Fracture simulator can be developed.

40|$|The {{area around}} Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) faces {{flooding}} and salt intrusion problems. Flooding problems {{are caused by}} intensive rainfall in the city, high river discharges and high tides on sea. Dr. Hoc, the vice-minister of MARD (Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) proposed to construct a hydraulic structure downstream of HCMC. This will solve both the flooding and siltation problem. A possibility is to construct a dam between Vung Tau and Go Cong. This solution has been worked out into a preliminary design, which includes a design for the cross section and {{an investigation into the}} closure method. The hydraulic system where the project will be constructed consists of the Saigon - Dong Nai river system and the East Sea, and can be classified as an estuary with a (mainly semi-diurnal) mixed tide. Waves are moderate in the area. A dam will be constructed between Go Cong and the Dong Nai navigation channel. Over the Dong-Nai navigation channel to Vung Tau a bridge is planned, to minimise navigation delays and changes in tidal and salinity range in the Can Gio mangrove forest. To make a closed basin, Can Thanh will be connected with the dam near the Dong Nai navigation channel. Ship locks and discharge sluices will be constructed at the sides of the existing navigation channel in the Soi Rap. The final closure of the dam will take place in the Soi Rap navigation channel. A road on the dam will connect Vung Tau with Go Cong. Because there is no subsoil information available at the location of the dam, the soil layering and parameters are estimated based on information from locations {{in the vicinity of the}} dam. Three different soil profiles were drawn up. Measures have to be taken to increase the bearing capacity of the subsoil and decrease settlements during the lifetime of the dam. If thick layers of weak subsoil is present, drainage in combination with pre-loading will be the best solution. In case of a stronger subsoil partial replacement with sand is favourable. To build the dam, the use of local material is a cheap and easy solution. Near Vung Tau a number of areas are present where sand can be obtained. Rock can be found in mountains in the neighbourhood of Vung Tau. Since there is already a stone quarry in this area, it is assumed that the rock is of good quality. By means of a Multi Criteria Analysis it was found that a building a dam with a sand core is the best solution in this project. Degradation or even failure of (elements of) the structure may occur as a result of loadings during the operational phase or in accidental situations. The principal failure mechanisms for the VT-GC dam are checked. Slope, crest and toe protections were designed to prevent failure. Two designs were made for the cross section of the dam: one with an outer slope revetment made of asphalt and one for an outer slope revetment made of rock. The biggest differences in these designs can be found in the crest height and layer thicknesses. The construction of the dam should start with the construction of the bridge and work islands. Next, the discharge sluices and navigation locks will be made in building pits. Then the dam will be constructed. This starts with the foundation and scour protection which will be constructed using barges. Waterborne equipment is preferred because of the easier logistics and larger capacities. The core material, filter layers, underlayer, toe and armour layer will be constructed layer by layer to be able to raise the relatively steep slopes. Where water depths are too low, cranes operating from pontoons or rolling equipment can be used. After completion of the core and revetment, the crest is constructed and the dam can be finished with the construction of the road. The closure of the final gap is a very important aspect within the construction of the dam. A storage area approach is used to determine the system behaviour during closure. High velocities in the final gap make it impossible to close the gap with sand. A bottom protection is necessary in the final gap to prevent a scour hole, caused by high velocities, from developing too close to the dam. The gap is closed with coarser material than sand. A combination of vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>closure</b> will be used. First barges dump stones to a level of MSL - 5 m. When the water is too shallow, dumping will continue from the sides of the closure gap. The final dam profile in the closure gap will be similar to the regular dam sections. A general estimation of the cost for the total project, based on costs in reference projects, is 3. 1 billion US dollar. The Dong Thap Muoi region is a very important agricultural area for the production of rice. Due to the low river discharges and the large influence of the tide, the salt concentrations in the Vam Co rivers are high, causing problems for the farmers. An estimation of the salt intrusion length was made using a predictive steady-state salt intrusion model, according to Savenije. Unfortunately it was not possible to perform salinity measurements in the Vam Co River, so data from three fixed measurement stations was used. With this data, it was possible to fit the model roughly but more data is needed to make the model more accurate. Student report for a Master Project.

40|$|AbstractNumerical mixing is {{inevitable}} for ocean models due to tracer advection schemes. Until now, {{there is no}} robust way to identify the regions of spurious mixing in ocean models. We propose a new method to compute the spatial distribution of the spurious diapycnic mixing in an ocean model. This new method {{is an extension of}} available potential energy density method proposed by Winters and Barkan (2013). We test the new method in lock-exchange and baroclinic eddies test cases. We can quantify the amount and the location of numerical mixing. We find high-shear areas are the main regions which are susceptible to numerical truncation errors. We also test the new method to quantify the numerical mixing in different <b>horizontal</b> momentum <b>closures.</b> We conclude that Smagorinsky viscosity has less numerical mixing than the Leith viscosity using the same non-dimensional constant...|$|R
30|$|We {{have used}} a global model of the solar wind {{magnetosphere}} interaction to model the high latitude part of the external contributions to the geomagnetic field near the Earth. The model also provides corresponding values for the electric field. Geomagnetic quiet conditions were modeled to provide simulated external contributions relevant for internal field modeling. These have proven very valuable for the design and planning of the upcoming multi-satellite Swarm mission. In addition, a real event simulation was carried out for a moderately active time interval when observations from the Ørsted and CHAMP sattelites were available. Comparisons between the simulation results and the satellite observations for this event demonstrate {{the current level of}} validity of the global model. We find that the model reproduces quite well the region 1 current system and nightside region 2 currents whereas it consistently underestimates the dayside region 2 currents and overestimates the <b>horizontal</b> ionospheric <b>closure</b> currents in the dayside polar cap. Furthermore, with this example we illustrate the great benefit of utilizing the global model for the interpretation of Swarm external field observations and, likewise, the potential of using Swarm measuremnets to test and improve the global model.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of drift closure {{caused by}} the thermal load have been made {{routinely}} during the Spent Fuel Test in Climax granite since about six weeks after emplacement of the fuel. <b>Horizontal</b> and vertical <b>closure</b> was measured with a manually operated tape extensometer at various locations along the lengths of the drifts. Average closures ranged from 0 to 0. 6 mm, horizontal and vertical, out to about 2. 2 years {{since the start of}} the test. At the same time, displacements from the thermal loads were measured with rod extensometers emplaced to measure relative displacements between hole collars and anchor points in holes drilled from two parallel heater drifts. These data are compared with thermo-elastic finite element calculations which utilized measured properties of the Climax granite. The calculations show that more than half of the closures occur between fuel installation and the first closure measurement. The comparisons show that the results track each other, in that where closure followed by dilation is measured, the calculations also show this effect. The agreement is excellent, considering the averaged measured closures remain within 30 % of the total calculated drift closures and the extremely small magnitude of the relative displacements (0. 5 mm), measured or calculated...|$|R
40|$|The UAS {{community}} in the United States has identified {{the need for a}} collision avoidance region in which UAS Detect-and-Avoid (DAA) vertical guidance is restricted to preclude interoperability issues with manned aircraft collision avoidance system vertical resolution advisories (RAs). This paper documents the process by which the collision avoidance region was defined. Three candidate definitions were evaluated on 1. 3 million simulated pairwise encounters between UAS and manned aircraft covering a wide range of <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>closure</b> rates, angles, and miss distances. They were evaluated with regard to UAS DAA interoperability with manned aircraft collision avoidance systems in terms of: 1) the primary objective of restricting DAA vertical guidance before RAs when the aircraft are close, and 2) the secondary objective of avoiding unnecessary restrictions of DAA vertical guidance at a DAA alert when the aircraft are further apart. The collision avoidance region definition that fully achieves the primary objective and best achieves the secondary objective was recommended to and accepted by the UAS {{community in}} the United States. By this definition, UAS and manned aircraft are in the collision avoidance region [...] during which DAA vertical guidance is restricted [...] when the time to closest point of approach is less than 50 seconds and either the time to co-altitude is less than 50 seconds or the current vertical separation is less than 800 feet...|$|R
