5000|$|The D-400 series engine or the Iron Horse {{engine was}} a {{light-duty}} two-stroke engine used for powering lawnmowers {{produced in the}} 1960s to the early 1980s. D-400 engines were single-cylinder engines designed and manufactured by the Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC; Johnson and Evinrude) for Lawn-Boy and Masport. The D-400 engines displaced 109 cc, generated 2.61 kW of power, and operated {{in the range of}} 2400-3300 RPM. The engines have a distinctive rectangular cowling that has created a nickname of Brick-top mowers. Another distinctive feature is the two-finger vertical recoil starter. The kidney-shaped muffler and <b>exhaust</b> <b>unit</b> is mounted beneath the mowers' deck and gives the engine a small, low profile design when compared to the newer and more powerful lawnmower engines. The ignition system employs a magneto, points, and a condenser (capacitor) set-up with an unusual spark-advance system which utilised a weight on the crankshaft to adjust the spark-advance amount depending on engine speed. The sprung governor was also unusual with a throw-yoke which operated under the flywheel and was linked to the throttle. The carburettor was a float design and fed into a pair of reed valves.|$|E
40|$|Harnessing {{waste energy}} from the manmade air fields of {{buildings}} presents a new area of renewable energy to explore. Due to the unpredictability of the natural wind, {{this study is to}} evaluate the practicality for harnessing waste {{energy from the}} air conditioner exhaust units which are a more constant and predictable source available in the buildings. A prototype of the micro wind turbine has been designed to minimize the negative effect of the exhaust sources. After the micro wind turbine was manufactured, the performance of the turbine was tested in the selected air conditioner <b>exhaust</b> <b>unit.</b> Increasing the rotor solidity and decreasing the resistance of the generator contribute to improved starting torque and decreased generator break in torque respectively in the design. The power generation of the micro wind turbine increases with an increase of the rotor speed. The 24 -hour operation of the prototype presents an observation for both exhaust performance and power generation prediction when the prototype is mounted on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of louvers {{installed in the}} air intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>unit</b> in the exteriors of the engine compartment of the vehicles is used for design, safety, noise reduction and other purpose. However, on the other hand, the louvers obstruct the flow of cooling air required by the radiator and other components. To know pressure loss characteristics as a parameter of the louver angle, wind tunnel measurement was performed {{in an effort to}} obtain design direction for louver shapes that minimize pressure loss when air passes through louvers while satisfying necessary functions. CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) was applied after verifying the measurement results. Additionally, the mechanism of pressure loss characteristic was studied by visualizing the air flow using LDV (Laser Doppler Velocimetry) and smoke wire method. As a result, it was found that CFD could have good agreement with measurement of pressure loss characteristic against louver angle variations. Visualization of air flows showed separation vortexes between louvers, indicating that narrowing the flow path caused by a separation {{was one of the reasons}} for pressure loss...|$|E
40|$|Automation of {{manufacture}} and quality control of nuclear fuel {{is a necessary}} condition of achievement of ambitious plans for atomic power development in the countries which join in process of an intensification of nuclear energy development. The modern automated industrial line is complex of modern machinery, automatized and computerized systems. As for leak testing of industrial products, {{it is very difficult}} to automatize them. As a rule, it is necessary to adapt technology of the control and automatized control device to each other. The aim of this paper is description of the automatized leak-testing devices for fuel elements for light water reactors which are used at factories of concern JSC "TVEL " (Russia). The leak-testing devices are intended for work in the modern automated lines of nuclear fuel manufacturing. Its main feature is the open vacuum system representing the tube with inlet and outlet vacuum sluice. The length of all chamber is smaller then length of a separate fuel element. Part of the tube between two sluices is high-vacuum test chamber with own <b>exhaust</b> <b>unit.</b> Fuel elements one by one pass through the high-vacuum chamber connected with helium leak-tester. Thus all length of each fuel element tests for leakage consistently. Due to small volume of the vacuum chamber, the device has short the response time and high sensitivity. All parts of the device operate under computer control under special program. If any leak had been detected, a defected fuel element will be rejected from product flow; place of defect will be marked...|$|E
50|$|This {{offensive}} {{had failed}} disastrously. Because the British Indian Army was being massively expanded, {{most of the}} Indian (and British) units committed to the attack lacked training and experience. <b>Exhausted</b> <b>units</b> were left in the front line, and their morale declined. Allied tactics and equipment were not suited to the jungle-covered hills, and Japanese units repeatedly achieved surprise by crossing rivers and hills which the Allies had dismissed as impassable. Finally, the Allied command structure was inefficient, with a single overworked division headquarters trying to control {{a large number of}} sub-units and also a large line-of-communications area.|$|R

The Flandern found itself in the Soviet line of advance, and saw heavy defensive fighting against relentless attacks which lasted until late February. At the end of February, the Soviet assault petered out, and the Germans went on the offensive, attempting to encircle the extended Soviet forces. For the next few months, the Flandern was engaged in efforts to complete the encirclement of the Soviet forces, and on 21 May 1942, the encirclement was closed.Over {{the course of the}} next month, the legion took part in the reduction of the pocket, being heavily engaged until 27 June 1942, when the <b>exhausted</b> <b>unit</b> was pulled out of the line for a rest and refit.|$|R
