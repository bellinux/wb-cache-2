The view that homosexuality was a curable sickness was widely believed in the medical community, general population, and among many lesbians themselves.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{attachment}} difficulties within the styles which may result in <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E

40|$|Statement of the problem: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} {{is to examine the}} available literature concerning <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> among young disabled readers. Specific areas deemed significant for consideration are: (1) To identify the factors which have an influence on reading disability. (2) To determine the relationship between <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> and young disabled readers. (3) To identify and describe certain characteristics of <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> among young disabled readers. (4) To ascertain what conclusions can be drawn from a research investigation concerning <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> among young disabled readers. Methods and procedures: This investigation is a library research study in which the researcher limited the findings to literature published relating to the subject from the years 1930 to 1967. A review of the findings was done with data being gathered from books, periodicals, and pamphlets concerning authorities' opinions on <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> among young disabled readers. Summary and findings: Most authorities adhere to the concept of multiple-causation factors in regard to the child's reading disability. Opinions differ as to the relationship between <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> and reading disability; whether <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> are the cause, the effect, or concomitant with the reading disability has not been agreed upon by experts in the field of reading. However, <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> appear so frequently in cases of reading retardation that they warrant detailed, individual investigation. An infinite variety and complexity of personality disturbances are apparent in many children with reading disorders. These patterns are all interwoven and act simultaneously to eventually bring about the disability in the young reader. The researcher recognizes an urgent need for specialists in various areas, such as psychotherapists, to work closely with reading specialists and classroom teachers in an effort to comprehend and curtail <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> in young disabled readers...|$|R

25|$|Within a {{month after}} Genie's {{admission}} to Children's Hospital, Jay Shurley, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Oklahoma and a specialist in extreme social isolation, {{took an interest in}} her case. Shurley noted that Genie's was the most severe case of isolation he had ever studied or heard about, which he maintained more than 20 years later. Over the next year and a half he came on three three-day visits to conduct daily observations and to carry out a sleep study, hoping to determine if Genie was autistic, whether or not she had sustained any brain damage, and whether or not she was born mentally disabled. Shurley concluded she was not autistic, with which later researchers concurred; he noted that she had a high level of <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance,</b> but wrote that her eagerness for new stimuli and lack of behavioral defense mechanisms were uncharacteristic of autism.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> such as depression, {{anxiety and}} stress play an {{important}} role in the management of diabetes mellitus since their presence can adversely affect glycemic control, quality of life and compliance with medications. Despite this, <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> are consistently under-diagnosed and under-treated by physicians in general practice. Objectives: This study aims to determine the prevalence and severity of <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> among diabetic patients Methodology: This is a cross sectional study conducted on a sample of 200 patients with diabetes mellitus attending the diabetic clinic at the Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan, Pahang state, Malaysia. The prevalence and severity of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms were assessed in those diabetic patients by using the self-rating Bahasa Malaysia version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS- 42). Results: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among diabetic patients was 13. 5 %, 28 %, 11 % respectively. Most of the patients with <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> had moderate depression and anxiety symptoms. However, stress symptoms were mild. Although females showed higher prevalence of <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances,</b> only anxiety was significantly higher than males. Conclusion: Diabetic patients are at risk to develop psychiatric illnesses in the form of depression, anxiety and stress. Anxiety symptoms were more prominent than depression and stress in diabetic patient...|$|R
2500|$|Nutrition {{disorders}} and nutritional deficits may cause neurodevelopmental disorders, such as spina bifida, and the rarely occurring anencephaly, {{both of which}} are neural tube defects with malformation and dysfunction of the nervous system and its supporting structures, leading to serious physical disability and emotional sequelae. The most common nutritional cause of neural tube defects is folic acid deficiency in the mother, a B vitamin usually found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and milk products. (Neural tube defects are also caused by medications and other environmental causes, many of which interfere with folate metabolism, thus they are considered to have multifactorial causes.) Another deficiency, iodine deficiency, produces a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders ranging from mild <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance</b> to severe mental retardation.

2500|$|A {{commonly}} used diagnostic checklist in attachment therapy is the Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire or [...] "RADQ", which originated at the Institute for Attachment in Evergreen. It is presented {{not as an}} assessment of reactive attachment disorder but rather attachment disorder. The checklist includes 93 discrete behaviors, many of which either overlap with other disorders, like Conduct Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder or {{are not related to}} attachment difficulties. It is largely based on the earlier Attachment Disorder Symptom Checklist which itself shows considerable overlap with even earlier checklists for indicators of sexual abuse. The Attachment Disorder Symptom Checklist includes statements about the parent's feelings toward the child as well as statements about the child's behavior. For example, parental feelings are evaluated through responses to such statements as [...] "Parent feels used" [...] and [...] "is wary of the child's motives if affection is expressed", and [...] "Parents feel more angry and frustrated with this child than with other children". The child's behavior is referred to in such statements as [...] "Child has a grandiose sense of self-importance" [...] and [...] "Child 'forgets' parental instructions or directives". The compiler of the RADQ claims validity by reference to the Attachment Disorder Symptom Checklist. It also purports to diagnose attachment disorder {{for which there is no}} classification. A critic has stated that a major problem of the RADQ is that it has not been validated against any established objective measure of <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbance.</b>|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the prevalence of <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> and their characteristics in our stroke patients, according to hemispheric lateralization of cerebral lesion (as recorded by CT), patient sex and grade of neurological handicap (as assessed by Rankin scale). The study included 50 patients (29 men and 21 women, mean age 65. 52 ± 7. 07 and 64. 62 ± 11. 83 years, respectively) who had suffered ischemic stroke 3 weeks to 6 months before the study. The Crown-Crisp experience index which consists of six scales: scales of anxiety, phobia, obsession, somatization, depression and hysteria, were used for detection of <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Results showed a high prevalence of <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> in the study group. Depression was most common (36 of study patients), followed by generalized anxiety (n= 29) and phobic disturbances (n= 33). According to hemispheric lateralization of the cerebral lesion, a more intense emotional response was found in case of right hemispheric lesions, however, the difference was statistically significant only on the scale of somaticized anxiety (p< 0. 05). According to sex, a more intense emotional response was recorded in women. The difference being statistically significant on the scales of anxiety (p< 0. 05), depression (p< 0. 05) and phobia (p< 0. 01).

Benham had come to South Africa to see into the question of Indian immigration, and he was now on his way to meet Amanda in London. Neither man had given much heed to the gathering social conflict on the Rand until the storm burst about them. There had been a few paragraphs in the papers about a dispute upon a point of labour etiquette, a question of the recognition of Trade Union officials, a thing that impressed them both as technical, and then suddenly a long incubated quarrel flared out in rioting and violence, the burning of houses and furniture, attacks on mines, attempts to dynamite trains. White stayed in Johannesburg because {{he did not want to}} be stranded up country by the railway strike that was among the possibilities of the situation. Benham stayed because he was going to London very reluctantly, and he was glad of this justification for a few days' delay.

40|$|Background: Dyspepsia is a {{constellation}} of symptoms referable to the gastroduodenal region of the upper gastrointestinal tract. <b>Emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> are often associated with dyspepsia and have been proposed {{as one of the}} possible causes of dyspepsia. This study was aimed to evaluate the difference between the severity of dyspepsia using porto alegre dyspeptic symptoms questionnaire (PADYQ) and <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> using depression, anxiety, stress scales (DASS). Method: This study was a cross-sectional analytical study. All the subjects were evaluated using PADYQ and DASS. PADYQ is classified into four categories (no, mild, moderate and severe dyspepsia symptoms). Data was analyzed using Independent t-test and Mann-Whitney test. A p < 0. 05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: There were 90 subjects that enrolled in this study, consisted of 47 (52. 2 %) males and 43 (47. 8 %) females. Thirty three (36. 7 %) subjects had PADYQ score was < 6, while it was ≥ 6 in the other 57 (63. 3 %) subjects. DASS scores were significantly different in subjects without dyspepsia symptoms compared to subjects with dyspepsia symptoms. There is a difference in DASS scores between subjects with different categories of dyspepsia symptoms (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: There was a difference in the severity of <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> among subjects with dyspepsia symptoms and without dyspepsia symptoms. The severity of <b>emotional</b> <b>disturbances</b> parallel with the severity of dyspepsia.
