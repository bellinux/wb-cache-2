25|$|The {{war ended}} to Treaty of Turku and Russian {{withdrawal}} in June 1743, after which Fithie's yard focused on ship repairs. In 1747 Fithie <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> {{to extend the}} yard for larger vessels and to start rope production. The rope factory was built next to street between the city centre and Turku Castle. Most of the raw material hemp was imported from Riga.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the notable}} {{measures}} taken by Huq included using both administrative and legal measures {{to relieve the}} debts of peasants and farmers. He protected the poor agriculturists from the clutches of the usurious creditors by enforcing the Bengal Agricultural Debtors' Act (1938). He established Debt Settlement Boards {{in all parts of}} Bengal. The Money Lenders' Act (1938) and the Bengal Tenancy (Amendment) Act (1938) improved the lot of the peasants. The Land Revenue Commission appointed by the Government of Bengal on 5 November 1938 with Sir Francis Floud as Chairman, submitted the final report on 21 March 1940. This was the most valuable document related to the land system of the country. The Tenancy Act of 1885 was amended by the Act of 1938 and thereby all provisions relating to enhancement of rent were suspended for a period of 10 years. It also abolished all kinds of ABWAB and selamis (imposts) imposed traditionally by the zamindars on raiyats. The raiyats <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to transfer their land without paying any transfer-fee to zamindars. The law reduced the interest rate for arrears of rent from 12.50% to 6.25%. The raiyats also <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to get possession of the nadi sekasti (land lost through river erosion and appeared again) land by payment of four years of rent within twenty years of the erosion. Thus several acts enforced during Huq's Premiership helped the peasants to lighten some of their burdens though Huq could not fully execute his programme of Dal-Bhat placed before the people during his election campaigns. Huq also promoted affirmative action for Bengali Muslims.|$|E

Other Asian countries gave women {{the right to vote}} in the mid 20th century – Japan (1945), China (1947) and Indonesia (1955). In Africa, women generally <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote along with men through universal suffrage – Liberia (1947), Uganda (1958) and Nigeria (1960). In many countries in the Middle East universal suffrage was acquired after World War II, although in others, such as Kuwait, suffrage is very limited. On 16 May 2005, the Parliament of Kuwait extended suffrage to women by a 35–23 vote.|$|E

500|$|Josh Harrison of Ology {{deemed the}} episode a [...] "good sign" [...] {{that the second}} season will be [...] "just as good, if not better" [...] than the first season. He said, [...] "The way it all works {{together}} in this episode ... is subtle and surprising but nevertheless convincing evidence that there's method to the madness. Ugly Americans knows when to play this card; at all other junctures, it's <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> instinct when it shows us yet more madness." [...] Harrison praised the battle scene between the wizards and the demons, calling it [...] "one of the best single sequences in the series so far". In contrast, The Standard-Times critic Kevin McDonough was more critical regarding the episode, noting that it [...] "tries a tad too hard". McDonough commented: [...] "The efforts to meld 1980s summer-camp fantasy comedies with the Harry Potter movies are more odd than amusing. Then again, that pretty much sums up Ugly Americans itself." ...|$|E

It's not jam-packed full of one-liners. What humor there is in the film is dark." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{series of}} {{movements}} began across South Carolina for Bahá'ís: in 1937 Christine Bidwell and Marie Kershaw from North Augusta tried {{to foster a}} group in Aiken, in late 1936-7 two women - Amelie Bodmer and May Fisher [...] - traveled the state in a trailer, in late 1937 Emogene Hoagg and Agnes O’Neill spent the winter in Charleston, and Louise Thompson moved there when they left and then Emogene Hoagg returned in 1939. Hoagg reconnected with Westendorff but while alittle familiar with the beliefs of the religion he didn't confine himself to its teachings and felt he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing to believe by himself. [...] However Hoagg made progress speaking to some groups through the support of her landlady. However Hoagg was asked to go to Cuba to work on bringing the religion there in the Fall of 1940. Louise Thompson and Emma Thompson moved to Charleston {{to try to keep}} development going.|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, Richard James, a naval {{mechanical}} engineer {{stationed at the}} William Cramp and Sons shipyards in Philadelphia, was developing springs that could support and stabilize sensitive instruments aboard ships in rough seas. James accidentally knocked one of the springs from a shelf, {{and watched as the}} spring [...] "stepped" [...] in a series of arcs to a stack of books, to a tabletop, and to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. James's wife Betty later recalled, [...] "He came home and said, 'I think if I <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> property of steel and the right tension; I could make it walk.'" [...] James experimented with different types of steel wire over the next year, and finally found a spring that would walk. [...] Betty was dubious at first, but changed her mind after the toy was fine-tuned and neighborhood children expressed an excited interest in it. She dubbed the toy Slinky (meaning [...] "sleek and graceful"), after finding the word in a dictionary, and deciding that the word aptly described the sound of a metal spring expanding and collapsing.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973 all was {{not well}} for Haffkine and Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show, David left the band in and was {{replaced}} by John Wolters. The group had a difficult time meeting the high expectations created by Sloppy Seconds, and the result was Belly Up, which Huey noted [...] "was unfortunately prophetic."

The album was sold in the US, UK, Europe and Canada. Dr. Hook was just as famed for their crazed stage antics, which ranged from surreal banter to impersonating their own opening acts, but it was the group's nonchalance about business matters that led to bankruptcy."If we were in the black when we finished a tour, we'd party into the red," [...] says Locorriere. They were forced to file bankruptcy in 1974, although they continued to tour incessantly.|$|E

2500|$|On November 19, 2016, Mangubat {{returned}} to the competition, already in its fourth Quarter, for another chance {{of being one of}} the semifinalists. On his first performance, he sang [...] "Love Runs Out" [...] by OneRepublic. Valera commented that Mangubat <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> image, moves, energy, intelligence, and talent, but cast some doubt on whether he has grown wiser and luckier on his second attempt. Garnering an average score of 95.4%, Mangubat won the first round and became the daily winner. On his second performance, he sang [...] "When We Were Young" [...] by Adele where he got an average score of 96.6% eventually beating the defending champion. He won again on his second day with [...] "Incomplete" [...] by Backstreet Boys. On his third day, however, he made an apparent mistake with the abridged lyrics of the song [...] "All Or Nothing" [...] by O-Town which disappointed the judges prompting Valera to call the performance [...] "palpak" [...] (failure). Despite this, after looking into all considerations, the judges still ruled in favor of Mangubat. His wins continued up to the fifth day making him the third semifinalist of the quarter. He remained the defending champion until his eighth day when he lost to the daily winner.|$|E

I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.'
