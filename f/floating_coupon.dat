5000|$|A {{medium-term}} note (MTN) is a debt note that usually matures (is paid back) in 5-10 years, but the term {{may be less}} than one year or as long as 100 years. They can be issued on a fixed or <b>floating</b> <b>coupon</b> basis. Floating rate {{medium-term note}}s {{can be as simple as}} paying the holder a coupon linked to Euribor +/- basis points or can be more complex structured notes linked, for example, to swap rates, treasuries, indices, etc. When they are issued to investors outside the US, they are called [...] "Euro Medium Term Notes" [...] (EMTN). Issuance of MTNs to investors based in the US requires a separate US MTN program.|$|E
40|$|Three {{approaches}} {{toward the}} determination of fixed swap rates are presented in this article: a swap as a portfolio of bonds with a fixed and <b>floating</b> <b>coupon,</b> a swap as a portfolio of forwards, and a swap as {{the difference between the}} cap and the floor (zero-collar). Later in the paper, credit risk is taken in consideration. The credit risk of interest-rate swaps is much lower than that of loans or corporate bonds. Empirical research is presented to support the analysis. One of the most important determinants of credit risk in a swap spread is the yield curve slope. interest-rate swap; bonds; credit risk...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an extended structural credit risk model that pro- vides closed form solutions for fixed and <b>floating</b> <b>coupon</b> bonds and credit default swaps. This structural model is an "extended" {{one in the}} following sense. It allows for the default free term structure {{to be driven by}} the a multi-factor Gaussian model, rather than by a single factor one. Expected default occurs as a latent diffusion process first hits the default barrier, but the diffusion process is not the value of the firm's assets. Default can be "expected" or "unexpected". Liquidity risk is correlated with credit risk. It is not necessary to disentangle the risk of unexpected default from liquidity risk. A tractable and accurate recovery assumption is proposed. structural credit risk model, Vasicek model, Gaussian term structure model, bond pricing, credit default swap pricing, unexpected default, liquidity risk. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the pricing of highly {{structured}} convertible bonds by taking a real world case. To this end we examine the Cashes (Convertible And Subordinated Hybrid Equity-linked Securities), which are characterized by both voluntary and mandatory conversion that depend on different triggering events, as well as <b>floating</b> <b>coupons</b> whose payment hinges on dividends and earning of the issuer. Our results highlight that prices are very sensitive to the modelling of the sources of uncertainty, both market and credit risk, and underscore the relevance of the time horizon chosen for the estimation...|$|R
5000|$|This {{simply means}} tranches that pay down [...] The coupons on the tranches {{would be set}} so that in {{aggregate}} the tranches pay {{the same amount of}} interest as the underlying mortgages. The tranches could be either fixed rate or floating rate. If they have <b>floating</b> <b>coupons,</b> they would have a formula that make their total interest equal to the collateral interest. For example, with collateral that pays a coupon of 8%, you could have two tranches that each have half of the principal, one being a floater that pays LIBOR with a cap of 16%, the other being an inverse floater that pays a coupon of 16% minus LIBOR.|$|R
40|$|A general {{equilibrium}} {{model is}} defined from the works of Lucas [1978] and Campbell [1986]. Within the framework of this model, we establish various explicit formulas for bond pricing: zero-coupon options, interest rate options, <b>coupon</b> bond options, <b>floating</b> rate <b>coupon</b> bonds. The formulas so obtained {{are related to the}} previous literature on bond pricing. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposal}} for banks to issue contingent capital that must convert into common equity when the banks' stock price falls below a specified threshold, or "trigger," {{does not in}} general lead to a unique equilibrium in equity and contingent capital prices. Multiple or no equilibrium arises because both equity and contingent capital are claims on {{the assets of the}} issuing bank. For a security to be robust to price manipulation, it must have a unique equilibrium. For a unique equilibrium to exist, mandatory conversion cannot result in any value transfers between equity holders and contingent capital investors. The necessary condition for unique equilibrium is usually not satisfied by contingent capital with a fixed coupon rate; however, contingent capital with a <b>floating</b> <b>coupon</b> rate is shown to have a unique equilibrium if the coupon rate is set equal to the risk-free rate. This structure of contingent capital anchors its value to par throughout the time before conversion, making it implementable in practice. Although contingent capital with a unique equilibrium is robust to price manipulation, the no-value-transfer condition may preclude it from generating the desired incentives for bank managers and demand from investors.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a structural credit risk {{model of a}} bank that issues deposits, shareholders' equity, and fixed or <b>floating</b> <b>coupon</b> bonds {{in the form of}} contingent capital or subordinated debt. The return on the bank's assets follows a jump-diffusion process, and default-free interest rates are stochastic. The equilibrium pricing of the bank's deposits, contingent capital, and shareholders' equity is studied for various parameter values haracterizing the bank's risk and the contractual terms of its contingent capital. Allowing for the possibility of jumps in the bank's asset value, as might occur during a financial crisis, has distinctive implications for valuing contingent capital. Credit spreads on contingent capital are higher the lower is the value of shareholders' equity at which conversion occurs and the larger is the conversion discount from the bond's par value. The effect of requiring a decline in a financial stock price index for conversion (dual price trigger) is to make contingent capital more similar to non-convertible subordinated debt. The paper also examines the bank's incentive to increase risk when it issues different forms of contingent capital as well as subordinated debt. In general, a bank that issues contingent capital has a moral hazard incentive to raise its assets' risk of jumps, particularly when the value of equity at the conversion threshold is low. However, moral hazard when issuing contingent capital tends to be less than when issuing subordinated debt. Because it reduces effective leverage and the pressure for government bailouts, contingent capital deserves serious consideration as part of a package of reforms that stabilize the financial system and eliminate "Too-Big-to-Fail.

40|$|A key {{measure of}} {{relative}} {{value of a}} corporate bond is its swap spread. This is the basis point spread over the interest-rate swap curve, and {{is a measure of}} the credit risk of the bond. In its simplest form, the swap spread can be measured as the difference between the yield-to-maturity of the bond and the interest rate given by a straight-line interpolation of the swap curve. In practice traders use the asset-swap spread and the Z-spread as the main measures of relative value. The government bond spread is also considered. We consider the two main spread measures in this paper. Asset-swap spread An asset swap is a package that combines an interest-rate swap with a cash bond, the effect of the combined package being to transform the interest-rate basis of the bond. Typically, a fixed-rate bond will be combined with an interest-rate swap in which the bond holder pays fixed coupon and received <b>floating</b> <b>coupon.</b> The floating-coupon will be a spread over Libor (see Choudhry et al 2001). This spread is the asset-swap spread and is a function of the credit risk of the bond over and above interbank credit risk. 1 Asset swaps may be transacted at par or at the bond’s market price, usually par. This means that the asset swap value is made up of the difference between the bond’s market price and par, as well as the difference between the bond coupon and the swap fixed rate. The zero-coupon curve is used in the asset swap valuation. This curve is derived from the swap curve, so it is the implied zero-coupon curve. The asset swap spread is the spread that equates the difference between the present value of the bond’s cashflows, calculated using the swap zero rates, and the market price of the bond. This spread is a function of the bond’s market price and yield, its cashflows and the implied zero-coupon interest rates. 2 Exhibit 1 shows the Bloomberg screen ASW for a GBP-denominated bond, GK...|$|E
50|$|Bonds {{typically}} {{pay interest}} at set intervals. Bonds with fixed coupons divide the stated coupon into parts defined by their payment schedule, for example, semi-annual pay. Bonds with <b>floating</b> rate <b>coupons</b> have set calculation schedules where the floating rate is calculated {{shortly before the}} next payment. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay interest. They are issued at a deep discount {{to account for the}} implied interest.|$|R
5000|$|On a {{technical}} note, when the asset swap is initiated between coupon dates, the asset swap buyer {{does not pay}} the accrued interest explicitly. Effectively, the full price of the bond is at par. At the next coupon period the asset swap buyer receives the full coupon on the bond and likewise pays the full coupon on the swap. However, the floating side payment, which may have a different frequency and accrual basis to fixed side, is adjusted by the corresponding accrual factor. Therefore, if we are exactly half way between <b>floating</b> side <b>coupons,</b> the <b>floating</b> payment received is half of the Libor plus asset swap spread. This feature prevents the calculated asset swap spread from jumping {{as we move forward}} in time through coupon dates.|$|R
40|$|The 1989 Brady Plan, {{named after}} the former US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, was the {{restructuring}} and reduction of several emerging countries' external debt into bonds with US Treasury bonds as collateral. So far no country has ever defaulted payments, yet {{the market value of}} these bonds is usually significantly lower than equivalent 'risk-free' bonds. Mexico was the first country to issue Brady bonds, in February 1990, and there soon followed other Latin American, Eastern European and Asian countries. In this paper, we describe a stochastic model for the instantaneous risk of default, applicable to many fixed-income instruments and Brady bonds in particular. We make some simplifying assumptions about this model and a model for the riskless short-term interest rate. These assumptions allow us to find explicit solutions for the prices of risky zero-coupon bonds and <b>floating</b> rate <b>coupons.</b> We apply the model to Latin American Brady bonds, deducing the risk of default implied by market prices. ...|$|R
40|$|Bond issuers {{frequently}} immunize/hedge {{their interest}} rate exposure {{by means of}} interest rate swaps (IRS). The receiving leg matches all bond cash-flows, while the pay leg requires <b>floating</b> rate <b>coupon</b> payments of form LIBOR + a spread. The goal of hedging against interest rate risk is only achieved in full if {{the present value of}} this spread is zero. Using market data we show that under a traditional IRS hedging strategy an investor could still experience significant cash flow losses given a 1 % shift in the underlying benchmark yield curve. We consider the instantaneous interest-rate risk of a bond portfolio that allows for general changes in interest rates. We make two contributions. The paper analyzes the size of hedging imperfections arising from the widening of the floating rate spread in a traditional swap contract and subsequently proposes two new practical, effective and analytically tractable swap structures; Structure 1 : An Improved Parallel Hedge Swap, hedges against parallel shifts of the yield curve and Structure 2 : An Improved Non-Parallel Hedge Swap, hedges against any movement of the swap curve. Analytical representations of these swaps are provided such that spreadsheet implementations are easily attainable.
