40|$|Piezoelectric ceramic {{actuators}} {{and materials}} {{play a key}} role in the development of advanced precision engineering. The breakthroughs in this field are closely related to the development of various types of piezoelectric ceramic actuators and related materials. The likelihood that the range of applications and demand for actuators will grow quickly has stimulated intensive researches on piezoelectric ceramics. Functionally gradient materials (FGMs) are new classes of composites characterized by compositional and/or microstructural gradation over macroscopic/microscopic distances. This constitutional gradation can be tailored to meet specific needs while providing the best utilization of composite components. Furthermore, FGMs technology is also a novel <b>interfacial</b> <b>technology</b> to solve the problems associated with the sharp interface between two dissimilar materials. In recent years significant advances in the development of FGMs have been achieved. In this paper, we first briefly review the recent progress of ceramic actuators and developments of piezoelectric materials, and then focus on summarizing typical applications of functional gradients in piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials.

40|$|The {{emulsifiers}} and <b>interfacial</b> <b>technology</b> {{are crucial}} for the stability of emulsions and govern the quality and value of a broad variety of foods. Conventional emulsifiers such as food-grade surfactants, modified starch, and gum arabic are widely used. However, {{there is a strong}} need for novel technologies for enhanced emulsion stability, especially for superior oxidative stability of polyunsaturated lipids. The hypothesis of this research was that, by strengthening the physical and electrostatic interfacial layer at the water-oil interface, the oxidative stability of emulsions can be significantly improved. To test this hypothesis, two novel strategies have been established. First, an amphiphilic carbohydrate nanoparticle, phytoglycogen octenyl succinate (PG-OSA), was created by modifying phytoglycogen, a food-based dendritic alpha-glucan (starch analogue). Due to its dendritic structure, PG-OSA has high molecular density in aqueous dispersion which may allow it to form a strong interfacial barrier against the permeation of pro-oxidative components. This is considered as the primary factor for the much reduced lipid oxidation observed in PG-OSA-based fish oil emulsions. Second, it was discovered that epsilon-polylysine, a GRAS-status antibacterial polypeptide {{can be used as a}} highly efficient anti-oxidative compound in emulsions. The interfacial electrostatic repelling of transition metal ions by the positively charged polylysine molecules could be the primary reason. When PG-OSA and polylysine were used together, the reduction of fish oil oxidation was the most significant, suggesting additive or synergistic effects between physical blocking and electrostatic repelling at the oil/water interface. In general, this work revealed novel and functionalities -for food-based nanoparticle emulsifiers. It was further observed that PG-OSA has a much reduced in vitro digestibility compared with its starch counterpart, suggesting its potential health benefit. Under a broader background, this work highlighted the potentials of using carbohydrate nanoparticles in food and non-food areas. ...|$|E

Primary and secondary emulsions were prepared in the absence and presence of corn syrup solids (a carbohydrate widely used in the micro-encapsulation of oils) and then their stability to environmental stresses was monitored. The secondary emulsions had better stability to droplet aggregation than primary emulsions exposed to thermal processing (30 – 90 °C for 30 min), freeze-thaw cycling (− 18 °C for 22 h/ 30 °C for 2 h), high sodium chloride contents (200 mM NaCl) and freeze-drying.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} interfacial composition on the freeze–thaw stability of oil-in-water emulsions. Three 5 % w/w oil-in-water emulsions (5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6. 0) were prepared using the layer-by-layer electrostatic deposition method that had different interfacial compositions: (i) primary emulsion (β-Lg); secondary emulsion (β-Lg–ι-carrageenan); (iii) tertiary emulsion (β-Lg–ι-carrageenan–gelatin). The primary, secondary and tertiary emulsions were subjected to from one to three freeze–thaw cycles (− 20 °C for 22 h, + 40 °C for 2 h) in the absence or presence of sucrose (10 % w/w), and then their stability was assessed by ζ-potential, particle size, microstructure and creaming stability measurements. In the absence of sucrose, the primary and secondary emulsions were highly unstable to droplet aggregation and creaming after three freeze–thaw cycles, whereas the tertiary emulsion was stable, which was attributed to the relatively thick biopolymer layer surrounding the oil droplets. In the presence of 10 % w/w sucrose, all of the emulsions were much more stable, which {{can be attributed to}} the ability of sucrose to increase the amount of non-frozen aqueous phase in the emulsions.

40|$|High-k/metal gate stacks {{have been}} {{introduced}} in CMOS technology {{during the last decade}} in order to sustain continued device scaling and ever-improving circuit performance. Starting from the 45 nm technology node, the stringent requirements in terms of equivalent oxide thickness and gate current density have rendered the replacement of the conventional SiON/poly-Si stack unavoidable. Although Hf-based technology has become the de facto industry standard for high-k/metal gate MOSFETs, problematic long-term scalability has motivated the research of novel materials and solutions to fulfill the target performances expected of gate stacks in future technology nodes. In this work, integration of a high-k interfacial layer has been identified as the most promising approach to improve gate dielectric scalability, since this technology presents the advantage of potential compatibility with both current Hf-based and plausible future higher-k materials. Thulium silicate has been selected as candidate material for integration as interfacial layer, thanks to its unique properties which enabled the development of a straightforward integration process achieving well-controlled and repeatable growth in the sub-nm thickness regime, a contribution of 0. 25 +- 0. 15 nm to the total EOT, and high quality of the interface with Si. Compatibility with industry-standard CMOS integration flows has been kept as a top priority {{in the development of the}} new technology. To this aim, a novel ALD process has been developed and characterized, and a manufacturable process flow for integration of thulium silicate in a generic gate stack has been designed. The thulium silicate <b>interfacial</b> layer <b>technology</b> has been verified to be compatible with standard integration flows, and fabrication of high-k/metal gate MOSFETs with excellent electrical characteristics has been demonstrated. The possibility to achieve high performance devices by integration of thulium silicate in current Hf-based technology has been specifically demonstrated, and the TmSiO/HfO 2 dielectric stack has been shown to be compatible with the industrial requirements of operation in the sub-nm EOT range (down to 0. 6 nm), reliable device operation over a 10 year expected lifetime, and compatibility with common threshold voltage control techniques. The thulium silicate <b>interfacial</b> layer <b>technology</b> has been especially demonstrated to be superior to conventional chemical oxidation in terms of channel mobility at sub-nm EOT, since the TmSiO/HfO 2 dielectric stack achieved ~ 20 % higher electron and hole mobility compared to state-of-the-art SiOx/HfO 2 devices at the same EOT. Such performance enhancement can provide a strong advantage in the EOT-mobility trade-off which is commonly observed in scaled gate stacks, and has been linked by temperature and stress analyses to the higher physical thickness of the high-k interfacial layer, which results in attenuated remote phonon scattering compared to a SiOx interfacial layer achieving the same EOT.

40|$|A three step process, {{based on}} {{electrostatic}} layer-by-layer deposition, {{was used to}} produce oil-in-water emulsions containing submicron (d 32 ≈ 0. 3 μm) oil droplets stabilized by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) –chitosan–pectin membranes (100 mM acetic acid, pH 3. 0). First, primary emulsions (5 wt% corn oil, 5 mM SDS) containing anionic droplets (ζ≈− 60 mV) stabilized by SDS membranes were prepared using a high-pressure value homogenizer. Second, secondary emulsions (1 wt% corn oil, 1 mM SDS, 0. 024 wt% chitosan) containing cationic droplets (ζ≈+ 59 mV) stabilized by SDS–chitosan membranes were formed by diluting the primary emulsion with aqueous chitosan solution and agitating to disrupt any flocs. Third, tertiary emulsions (0. 2 wt% corn oil, 0. 2 mM SDS, 0. 0048 wt% chitosan, 0. 040 wt% pectin) containing anionic droplets (ζ≈− 14 mV) stabilized by SDS–chitosan–pectin membranes were formed by diluting the secondary emulsion with aqueous pectin solution.

40|$|It {{has been}} years since the concept that {{inhomogeneity}} in pore size has an adverse effect on the thermal transport came into view. Typically, although some porous materials possess the identical porosity, they could show a strong inhomogeneity in pore size, making the physical parameters change greatly. However, one major and often overlooked challenge in understanding the underlying mechanism behind the above observation involves quantifying the effect of inhomogeneity. In this paper, the inhomogeneity in pore size is quantitatively evaluated to explain the thermal conductivity diminishment in the porous material system. By means of self-developed adaptable <b>interfacial</b> thermo-sensor <b>technology,</b> the thermal conductivity {{of a series of}} micro-porous foams with homogeneous pores are accurately characterized, and its evolution trend versus porosity agrees well with the typical homogeneous model. To compare with homogeneous materials, the thermal conductivity of the inhomogeneous porous materials is calculated by coupling 3 D tomographic modeling and finite element method. An appreciable thermal conductivity reduction up to 13. 5 % is found {{as a result of the}} constructed inhomogeneity for pore size distribution. Furthermore, the distinction between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous models would remarkably diminish as the porosity approaches a very high value, probably owing to the increment of the content of the solid-gas interface. Our work opens up fresh opportunities for research of super thermal insulation materials. In contrast to harnessing high porosity, developing inhomogeneity in pore size distribution could play a critical role in further lowering the thermal conductivity of porous thermal insulators...|$|R

Three oil-in-water emulsions were prepared with the same droplet concentration and buffer (5 wt % corn oil, 5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6) but with different biopolymers:[*] (i) primary emulsion:[*] 0. 5 wt % β-Lg; (ii) secondary emulsion:[*] 0. 5 wt % β-Lg, 0. 1 wt % ι-carrageenan; (iii) tertiary emulsion:[*] 0. 5 wt % β-Lg, 0. 1 wt % ι-carrageenan, 0 − 2 wt % gelatin. The secondary and tertiary emulsions were prepared by electrostatic deposition of the charged biopolymers onto the surfaces of the oil droplets so as to form two- and three-layer interfacial membranes, respectively. The stability of the emulsions to pH (3 − 8), sodium chloride (0 − 500 mM), calcium chloride (0 − 12 mM), and thermal processing (30 − 90 °C) was determined. We found that multilayer emulsions had better stability to droplet aggregation than single-layer emulsions under certain environmental conditions and that {{one or more of}} the biopolymer layers could be made to desorb from the droplet surfaces in response to specific environmental changes (e. g., high salt or high temperature).

40|$|MOSFETs using channel {{materials}} with low effective mass have {{been regarded as}} strongly important for obtaining high current drive and low supply voltage CMOS under sub 10 nm regime. From this viewpoint, attentions have recently been paid to III-V and Ge channels. However, {{one of the most}} critical issues for realizing Ge/III-V MOSFETs is gate insulator formation with superior MOS interface quality on Ge/III-V. In this paper, we focus on the possible solutions for gate stack technologies on Ge/III-V. As for Ge, GeO 2 /Ge interfaces have been regarded as promising. However, these interfaces have still employed thick GeO 2 layers. Recently, we have succeeded in thin EOT gate stacks with Ge oxide interfacial layers by using ECR plasma post oxidation.

40|$|Biopolymers, such as {{proteins}} and nucleic acids, are omnipresent in modern applications. The {{need to control}} interfacial molecular systems is becoming increasingly important {{in order to develop}} more sophisticated biopolymer-based technologies. Non-covalent interactions such as electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydrophobic interactions are integral in interfacial phenomena. These interactions dictate how molecules adsorb, desorb, and diffuse at interfaces. By understanding how these forces affect molecular dynamics, we can better design biopolymer-based <b>technologies.</b> <b>Interfacial</b> adsorption and interaction mechanisms are studied using polarized light microscopy and single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). Polarized light microscopy allows for the detection of birefringence within liquid crystal layers, corresponding to molecular orientation, while TIRFM allows detection of single-molecule adsorption, desorption and diffusion events at an interface. Using these techniques, mechanisms for the formation of surfactant-biopolymer complexes, electrostatically-driven protein adsorption, and protein layer formation are identified. From these results, single stranded DNA-surfactant complexes are found to increase the surfactant area per molecule leading to liquid crystal realignment. Electrostatic repulsion affected elementary adsorption of protein to a charged interface without affecting either elementary desorption or interfacial diffusion. Protein layer formation mechanisms were identified by comparing dynamic signatures and applying new analysis techniques to molecular trajectories. The development of surfactant-protein complexes creates protective effects preventing interfacial protein gelation. The work done in this thesis led to higher-order analysis of molecular trajectories. The new analysis techniques led to the development a new single-molecule micro-rheological technique, providing an unprecedented level of mechanistic interpretation of developing viscoelastic layers...|$|R
