50|$|In 1964-1965 Mooremack placed its Constellation Class freight liners in service, the Mormacargo, Mormaclynx, Mormacvega, Mormacdraco, Mormacaltair and Mormacrigel. The fast, {{state of}} the art vessels {{completed}} Mooremack's modernization program begun in 1956. On 11 February 1966 the Mormacaltair set sail from New York for Europe, establishing the first regularly scheduled transatlantic container service. Within weeks Mooremack was joined by United States Lines and Sea-Land Service, but Mooremack failed to exploit its first-off-the-mark lead and make the investment in <b>fully</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> <b>ships</b> necessary to realize the maximum efficiencies and cost savings that containerization promised. Left behind by U.S., British and European <b>ship</b> lines and <b>container</b> line consortia, Mooremack abandoned the North Atlantic trade in 1970 to concentrate on its cargo routes to South America and Africa, and sold four brand new combination break-bulk, <b>container,</b> roll-on/roll-off <b>ships</b> to American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines to offset losses.

50|$|J. Peter Grace, Jr. {{took over}} {{management}} of the company after his father suffered a stroke in 1945. After the war the Grace line operated 23 ships totaling 188,000 gross tons, and an additional 14 more on bareboat charters. In 1954 the company bought Davison Chemical Company (founded by William T. Davison as Davison, Kettlewell & Company in 1832), and the Dewey & Almy Chemical Company (founded in 1919 by Bradley Dewey and Charles Almy). In 1960 Grace Line, inspired by the pioneering efforts of Sea-Land Service, Matson Navigation, and Seatrain Lines, sought to begin containerizing its South American cargo operations by converting the conventional freighters Santa Eliana and Santa Leonor into <b>fully</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> <b>ships.</b> However, the effort was stymied by the opposition of longshoremen in New York and Venezuela and the ships were repeatedly laid up idle and were ultimately sold to the domestic container line Sea-Land Service in 1964. In 1963 Grace made a second attempt to containerize its South American trade when it ordered the four M-class combination passenger-cargo ships Santa Magdalaena, Santa Maria, Santa Mariana and Santa Mercedes with partial cellular holds, but they were no more successful as mixing conventional break-bulk cargo and containers in the same ship negated the operating economies that full containerization promised.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the start}} of the {{containerization}} revolution in 1950 's, not only the TEU capacity of the vessels has been increasing constantly, but also the number of <b>fully</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> <b>ships</b> has expanded substantially. Because of the tense competition among ports in recent years, improving the operational efficiency of ports has become an important issue in containership operations. Arrangement of containers both within the container terminal and on the containership {{play an important role in}} determining the berthing time. The berthing time of a containership is mainly composed of the unloading and loading time of containers. Containers in a containership are stored in stacks, making a container directly accessible only if it is on the top of one stack. The task of determining a good container arrangement to minimize the number of re-handlings while maintaining the ship's stability over several ports is called stowage planning, which is an everyday problem solved by ship planners. The horizontal distribution of the containers over the bays affects crane utilization and overall ship berthing time. In order to increase the terminal productivity and reduce the turnaround time, the stowage planning must conform to the berth design. Given the configuration of berths and cranes at each visiting port, the stowage planning must take into account the utilization of quay cranes as well as the reduction of unnecessary shifts to minimize the total time at all ports over the voyage. This dissertation introduces an optimization model to solve the stowage planning problem with crane utilization considerations. The optimization model covers a wide range of operational and structural constraints for containership load planning. In order to solve real-size problems, a meta-heuristic approach based on genetic algorithms is designed and implemented which embeds a crane split approximation routine. The genetic encoding is ultra-compact and represents grouping, sorting and assignment strategies that might be applied to form the stowage pattern. The evaluation procedure accounts for technical specification of the cranes as well as the crane split. Numerical results show that timely solution for ultra large size containerships can be obtained under different scenarios...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the container revolutionised maritime trade and <b>shipping.</b> Since 1956 <b>container</b> vessels have evolved from converted tankers and cargo <b>ships,</b> via full <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> <b>ships</b> that could navigate the Panama Canal, to post-Panamax vessels with a capacity of approx. 8500 TEU (Twenty foot Equivalent Unit). Even bigger <b>container</b> <b>ships</b> (9600 TEU) are to be delivered soon. However, current technical and physical constraints such as propulsion and port limitations pose restrictions to further growth. Moreover, the diminishing economies of scale in ship costs are offset by the increase of other costs involved (e. g. port fees, terminal handling charges). Nevertheless, empirical {{research shows that the}} concept of mega container vessels is appealing and that, if available, most shipping lines will deploy such ships. So, the next generation <b>container</b> <b>ships</b> will probably consist of Suez-max vessels (up to 12, 500 TEU) with twin propulsion systems.

5000|$|Keith Walton Tantlinger (March 22, 1919 - August 27, 2011) was a {{mechanical}} engineer and inventor. As Vice President of Engineering at the Fruehauf Trailer Corporation his inventions {{played a major role}} in containerization. [...] Working with a Fruehauf customer, Malcom McLean, they spearheaded the <b>container</b> <b>ship</b> revolution in the 1950s, Tantlinger developed much of the early technology that made modern <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> possible while at Fruehauf. After its initial order of containers from Brown Trailer, Sea-Land switched to containers made by the Strick division of the Fruehauf Trailer Company. Fruehauf had been one of the dominant players in building truck bodies and trailers for a long time, and, as already described, had previously innovated in the design and construction of the early commercial semi-trailers. President Roy Fruehauf was impressed with the idea of containerization, so in addition to manufacturing containers for Sea-Land his company agreed to make the trailer chassis that were needed, and also to provide financing to Sea-Land for the purchase of these containers and chassis. In 1958 Tantlinger left Sea-Land and became chief engineer at Fruehauf, where he continued to work with containers. More importantly, over the years he played a key role in the process of container standardization, working extensively on a committee of the American Standards Association (ASA) and later being critically involved with the ISO’s efforts. His designs included the corner casting and Twistlock systems found on every intermodal container, the spreader bar for automatic securing of containers lifted on and off ships, and the ship-shore container transfer apparatus for the first <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> <b>ship.</b> In the course of his professional career, Tantlinger was granted 79 United States patents, all related to transportation equipment. Many of his patents related to commercial highway freight trailers and transit buses.|$|R
40|$|The {{impressive}} {{growth of}} the Soviet Merchant Marine {{during the past two}} decades. and its anticipated future expansion have given rise to questions concerning the likely future impact of that fleet on world shipping and the relative importance of maritime commerce to the Soviet Union itself. U. S. owners and regulatory bodies have, along with other Western owners and shipping bodies, consistently pointed an accusing finger at the Soviets for attempting to capture more than a fair share of general cargo tonnage in the world liner market. Charges of predatory Soviet rate cutting practices have been widely advertised by American operators concerned with the growing presence of Soviet carriers in the highly competitive liner trades. At the same time, such claims are made with little or no reference to the mushrooming of the flags of convenience liner fleet, the comparative rates of growth of other merchant shipping powers, and the added value of the West 2 ̆ 7 s hugely dominant <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> <b>ship</b> fleet. This study examines the economic and political roles of the Soviet Union 2 ̆ 7 s Merchant Marine, and will address why and to what extent Soviet shipping has expanded into the U. S. liner trades.

40|$|From {{the advent}} of the {{containerization}} era, which transformed the conventional liner cargo vessels to <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> <b>ships,</b> major changes have resulted as far as it concerns <b>container</b> <b>ships</b> sizes. The continuous will of shipping liner companies for further achievements of economies of scale and cost savings during the years, has led to the introduction of larger vessels. The result of this continuous tendency is the Ultra Large <b>Container</b> <b>Ship</b> being the size of 12, 500 TEU. This vessel although not yet in operation is expected to be operational {{at the end of the}} decade. The aim of the thesis is to investigate the impact of the ULCV on major container ports serving the W. Europe-Far East liner trade. Chapters Two and Three investigate the initiatives adopted by the selected top container ports of each region being Rotterdam and Hong Kong, along with the port of Amsterdam, so as to offer high service efficiency and economies of scale to the today's larger <b>container</b> <b>ships.</b> The later port is being investigated due to the existence of a new container terminal with an intended berth especially designed for larger container vessels. In Chapter four a conceptual model is developed to define the thesis problem more clearly along with its main variables. Within the conceptual model, the framework of the research and the relationships among several factors that have been identified as important to the problem, are demonstrated. Continuing at Chapter five, the methodology of the research and the hypotheses that are to be investigated, are included. The use of a questionnaire has formed the basic mean for gathering primary data from the port industry, in addition to the secondary data included at the previous chapters. Chapter six includes the analysis of the primary data results, and shows how several major ports intend to respond to the future operation of Ultra Large Container Vessels. In addition the results of the survey are used in order to test the hypotheses stated at chapter five. Finally for the purpose of clarity and clear presentation, the thesis includes an introduction along with a brief summary of the subject and limitations of the enquiry, the proposed methodology, the reasons for the choice of this subject, and the main aims/objectives of the enquiry. Moreover the thesis ends with a conclusion of the overall research and further actions, which are necessary to be undertaken, so as a more adequate examination of the problem to take place...|$|R

40|$|Advanced marine design, {{particularly}} in the United States, advocates the use of cross-functional design teams, or Integrated Product Teams (IPT’s), who will undertake a concurrent engineering approach to all phases of ship design. Further, {{the study of the}} world-class Toyota automotive design process has highlighted the potential of a set-based design approach in concurrent engineering to provide a greater probability of achieving a global optimum for the overall design.
