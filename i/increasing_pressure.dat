5|$|From the Danish {{colonization}} in the 1700s to {{the beginning}} of Greenlandic home rule in 1979, Greenlandic experienced <b>increasing</b> <b>pressure</b> from the Danish language. In the 1950s, Denmark's linguistic policies were directed at replacing Greenlandic with Danish. Of primary significance was that post-primary education and official functions were conducted in Danish.|$|E

Stanisław Kania was viewed by Moscow as too independent, and on October 18, 1981, the Party Central Committee {{put him in the}} minority. Kania lost his post as First Secretary, and was replaced by Prime Minister (and Minister of Defence) Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who adopted a strong-arm policy.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to immediate practical concerns, the Christian Church {{was installed in}} Poland in its Western Latin Rite, an act that brought Mieszko's country into sphere of ancient Mediterranean culture. Of the issues requiring urgent attention, the preeminent one was the <b>increasing</b> <b>pressure</b> of the eastbound expansion of the German state (between the Elbe and the Oder rivers) and its plans to control the parallel expansion of the Church through the archdiocese in Magdeburg, the establishment of which was finalized in 968.|$|E

5|$|Jews also {{spread across}} Europe during the period.

Most Jews were confined to the cities, as they {{were not allowed to}} own land or be peasants. Besides the Jews, there were other non-Christians on the edges of Europe—pagan Slavs in Eastern Europe and Muslims in Southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of {{photographic}} societies such as Danske Kamera Piktorialister (Danish Camera Pictorialists) in the 1930s, there was <b>increasing</b> <b>pressure</b> from activists such as H.B.J.

A counter-movement to pictorialism, the 1920s' Neue Sachlichkeit was slow to reach Denmark but surfaced in 1948 when Keld Helmer-Petersen published his abstract colour studies in 122 Colour Photographs.|$|E
5|$|As {{the battles}} at P'ohang-dong raged to the south, the ROK 3rd Division faced <b>increasing</b> <b>pressure</b> from the NK 5th Division. North Korean {{officers}} from the division continued to attack the ROK unit hoping it would collapse, and the North Korean troops were able to slowly erode at the South Korean division′s defenses, forcing it into a smaller and smaller pocket. The ROK division was forced further south {{to the village of}} Changsa-dong, where U.S. Navy planners began preparations to evacuate the division by LSTs and DUKWs.|$|E

40|$|After {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI), a progressive injury and death of neurons and glia leads to decreased brain function. Endogenous and exogenous estrogens may protect these vulnerable cells. In this study, we hypothesized that <b>increased</b> <b>pressure</b> leads {{to an increase in}} aromatase expression and estrogen production in astrocytes. In this study, we subjected rat glioma (C 6) cells and primary cortical astrocytes to <b>increased</b> <b>pressure</b> (25 mm Hg) for 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. Total aromatase protein and RNA levels were measured using Western analysis and RT-PCR, respectively. In addition, we measured aromatase activity by assaying estrone levels after administration of its precursor, androstenedione. We found that <b>increased</b> <b>pressure</b> applied to the C 6 cells and primary cortical astrocytes resulted in a significant increase in both aromatase RNA and protein. To extend these findings, we also analyzed aromatase activity in the primary astrocytes during <b>increased</b> <b>pressure.</b> We found that <b>increased</b> <b>pressure</b> resulted in a significant (P < 0. 01) increase in the conversion of androstenedione to estrone. In conclusion, we propose that after TBI, astrocytes sense <b>increased</b> <b>pressure,</b> leading to an increase in aromatase production and activity in the brain. These results may suggest mechanisms of brain estrogen production after <b>increases</b> in <b>pressure</b> as seen in TBI patients...|$|R

5|$|Barley's {{relationship}} with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley {{had turned to}} East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable {{to rely on the}} protections and privileges of Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came under <b>increasing</b> <b>pressure</b> from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was the target of a successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and reams of paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.|$|E

His army's {{military}} failures, coupled with his press censorship {{and the police}} and army's use of torture and extrajudicial executions, were increasingly criticized both domestically and abroad. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry, leading him to buy arms from the United Kingdom. The opposition used this opportunity to call a general strike, accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on 9 April, it received strong support {{in central and eastern}} Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} <b>increasing</b> <b>pressure</b> to add rigor and preferably {{experimentation}} to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E

5|$|Porpoises {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to anthropogenic disturbances, and are keystone species, which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under <b>increasing</b> <b>pressure</b> from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the white}} dwarf's mass {{approach}} the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 it {{will no longer}} be supported by electron degeneracy pressure and it will undergo a collapse. For a core primarily composed of oxygen, neon and magnesium, the collapsing white dwarf is likely to form a neutron star. In this case, only a fraction of star's mass will be ejected as a result. If the core is instead made of carbon-oxygen, however, <b>increasing</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature will initiate carbon fusion in the center prior to attainment of the Chandrasekhar limit. The dramatic result is a runaway nuclear fusion reaction that consumes a substantial fraction of the star within a short time. This will be sufficient to unbind the star in a cataclysmic, Type Ia supernova explosion.|$|E

The situation was noted and addressed by the UN General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the clouds varies with depth and <b>increasing</b> <b>pressure.</b> In the upper cloud layers, with {{the temperature in the}} range 100–160K and pressures extending between 0.5–2 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185–270K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3–6 bar with temperatures of 190–235K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10–20 bar and temperatures are 270–330K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{culmination}} of a three-month siege by the British, the battle lasted about an hour. British troops commanded by General James Wolfe successfully resisted the column advance of French troops and Canadien militia under General Louis-Joseph, Marquis de Montcalm, employing new tactics that proved extremely effective against standard military formations used in most large European conflicts. Both generals were mortally wounded during the battle; Wolfe received three gunshot wounds that ended his life within minutes {{of the beginning of}} the engagement and Montcalm died the next morning after receiving a musket ball wound just below his ribs.
