5|$|Many {{populations of}} moorland birds, {{including}} {{the black and}} red grouse live here, and the country has internationally significant nesting grounds for seabirds such as the northern <b>gannet.</b> The golden eagle has become a national icon, and white-tailed eagles and ospreys have recently re-colonised the land. The Scottish crossbill is the only endemic vertebrate species in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise is then {{ordered to}} Mars {{to destroy the}} array, but is turned away when a warning shot from the weapon damages the ship. <b>Gannet</b> Brooks, now in the brig, reveals to Ensign Mayweather she is a Starfleet Intelligence operative, and that Terra Prime {{probably}} has an operative aboard. Under the urging of Minister Samuels, the crew of Enterprise conceive a way to approach the deadly station undetected, using a shuttlepod hidden inside {{the tail of a}} comet. Captain Archer elects to lead the away mission, along with Lieutenant Reed, Doctor Phlox, and Mayweather.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{two types}} of {{fixed-wing}} aircraft were operated from Melbourne. de Havilland Sea Venom FAW.53 fighter aircraft were flown by 805 Squadron RAN and 808 Squadron RAN, while Fairey <b>Gannet</b> anti-submarine strike aircraft were operated by 816 Squadron RAN and 817 Squadron RAN. At {{the time of their}} arrival, the Sea Venoms were the only radar equipped and all-weather combat aircraft in the Southern Hemisphere. At Melbournes commissioning, the standard air group consisted of eight Sea Venoms and two squadrons of eight Gannets, with two Bristol Sycamore search-and-rescue helicopters added shortly after the carrier entered service.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gannets</b> are colonial breeders on {{islands and}} coasts, {{normally}} laying one chalky, blue egg. <b>Gannets</b> lack brood patches {{and they use}} their webbed feet to warm the eggs. It takes five years for <b>gannets</b> to reach maturity. First-year birds are completely black, and subsequent sub-adult plumages show increasing amounts of white.|$|R
40|$|Field observationsaround {{the largest}} NorthernGannet Morus bassanuscolony in the North Sea, theBass Rock, showed that 66 %of all <b>Gannets</b> foraged inareas with very low densitiesof conspecifics, more than 100 km from the colony. When one forager foundprey, even distant Gannetsresponded by joining thefinder {{to obtain a}} share ofthe bounty but, because of the low densities of <b>Gannets</b> far from the colony,feeding {{opportunities}} were typically exploited by small flocks, with relatively fewcompeting birds. Intraspecific competition was thus less intense than it would havebeen nearer the colony. Searching and feeding tactics of <b>Gannets,</b> as well asforaging associations with other top predators, were different between sea areas. Low numbers of <b>Gannets</b> per flock occurred within inshore multi-species feedingassociations, where <b>Gannets</b> hampered feeding opportunities for other seabirds(and themselves) by plunge-diving into compact schools of small prey fish. Largerflocks of competing <b>Gannets</b> formed in situations where an escape response inprey fish was absent (discards behind commercial trawlers) or weakened (fishschools herded by marine mammals). The association of <b>Gannets</b> with marinemammals was typically an offshore phenomenon, despite the abundance ofcetaceans in inshore waters. Behind trawlers, <b>Gannets</b> focused mostly onroundfish, between 22 and 30 cm in length. Discards were, however, a fairlyunimportant source of food during the breeding season and natural feedingopportunities were widespread...|$|R

5|$|It is {{not known}} for certain why the {{albatrosses}} became extinct in the North Atlantic, although rising sea levels due to an interglacial warming period {{are thought to have}} submerged the site of a short-tailed albatross colony that has been excavated in Bermuda. Some southern species have occasionally turned up as vagrants in the North Atlantic and can become exiled, remaining there for decades. One of these exiles, a black-browed albatross, returned to <b>gannet</b> colonies in Scotland for many years in an attempt to breed.|$|E
5|$|The islands have {{a varied}} geology and history and several have both ecclesiastical {{connections}} and {{were involved in}} military occupations throughout the centuries of recorded history. Various lighthouses and other aids to navigation have been erected on the islands and skerries, one dating to the 17th century, but {{only one of the}} islands is still permanently inhabited. The area has a diversity of bird and sea life and the scientific name for the northern <b>gannet</b> is derived from this bird's connection with the Bass Rock.|$|E
5|$|They harass smaller raptors such as swamp harriers, {{whistling}} kites, brahminy kites and ospreys, {{forcing them}} to drop any food that they are carrying. Other birds victimised include silver and Pacific gulls, cormorants and Australasian gannets. There is one record of a white-bellied sea eagle seizing a <b>gannet</b> when unsuccessful in obtaining its prey. They may even steal food from their own species, including their mates. The white-bellied sea eagle attacks these birds by striking them with outstretched talons from above or by flying upside down underneath the smaller predator and snatching the prey, all the while screeching shrilly. Southern fur seals have also been targeted for their fish.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the family}} itself, three living genera—Sula (boobies, 6 species), Papasula (Abbott's booby), Morus (<b>gannets,</b> 3 species)—are recognized. A 2011 study of {{multiple}} genes found Abbott's booby to be basal {{to all other}} <b>gannets</b> and boobies, and likely to have diverged from them around 22 million years ago, and the ancestors of the <b>gannets</b> and remaining boobies split around 17 million years ago. The most recent common ancestor of all boobies lived in the late Miocene around 6 million years ago, after which time the boobies steadily diverged. The <b>gannets</b> split more recently, only around 2.5 million years ago.|$|R
5000|$|Nelson {{conducted}} pioneering fieldwork on {{the habits}} and communication methods of <b>gannets</b> and boobies; among his key hypotheses was {{the suggestion that}} <b>gannets</b> use a gesture known as [...] "skypointing" [...] to warn mates that {{they are about to}} leave the nest. As Scottish Field Magazine noted: [...] "He interpreted and described the fascinating non-verbal communication of <b>gannets.</b> As a zoology lecturer, he amused and inspired thousands of Aberdeen University students over many years with his 'skypointing' and 'beak fencing'." [...] He was the author of an authoritative 1,000-page monograph on boobies and <b>gannets,</b> including a volume on Pelecaniformes and a more general volume on seabird biology and ecology.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, <b>gannets</b> are a {{protected}} species. However, a legal exception {{is made for}} {{the inhabitants of the}} district of Ness (also known as Nis) of the Isle of Lewis in Scotland's Outer Hebrides, who are allowed to cull up to 2,000 <b>gannets</b> (locally known as guga) annually to serve as a traditional local delicacy—the taste is described as fishy. Many of these <b>gannets</b> are taken from Sula Sgeir, which is itself named after them.|$|R
5|$|Williams {{encouraged}} the local aircraft {{industry as a}} means to further the self-sufficiency of the Air Force and Australian aviation in general. He played a personal part {{in the creation of the}} Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in November 1936, headed up by former Squadron Leader Lawrence Wackett, late of the RAAF's Experimental Section. Williams made the first overseas flight in an aeroplane designed and built in Australia when he accompanied Squadron Leader Allan Walters and two aircrew aboard a Tugan <b>Gannet</b> to Singapore in February 1938.|$|E
5|$|Captain Archer {{meets with}} Samuels, who is {{concerned}} that news of the child will stir xenophobic sentiment. Lieutenant Reed is ordered by Archer to liaise with Harris of Section 31. He is informed that Khori {{was a member of}} Terra Prime, an anti-alien movement. Meanwhile, in the Terra Prime headquarters on the Moon, John Frederick Paxton and Doctor Mercer discuss the child. After Mercer leaves, Paxton sends for Daniel Greaves and tells him to deal with Mercer. On Earth, Archer tells Samuels that he knows that the minister was a former member of Terra Prime and convinces him to provide a case file on Khouri. Meanwhile, Ensign Mayweather gives his reporter ex-girlfriend, <b>Gannet</b> Brooks, a tour of the ship.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s the Australian Government and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) {{considered}} options {{to replace the}} aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne, and her air group. While Melbourne had only been commissioned in 1955, the de Havilland Sea Venom fighters and Fairey <b>Gannet</b> maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) were becoming obsolete. It was believed that Melbourne {{was too small to}} operate more modern aircraft types, and the RAN investigated options to buy a larger carrier. The Government judged that the cost of a new aircraft carrier was too high, especially given the expense of the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF's) procurement programs at that time, and in November 1959 it was announced that the FAA would cease to operate fixed-wing aircraft in 1963.|$|E

Most <b>gannets</b> occurred in Norwegian waters earlier than did most fulmars. Recovered fulmar bones greatly outnumber those of <b>gannets,</b> a pattern consistent with relative abundances in Norwegian waters today, {{but one that}} might also reflect differential accessibility and/or prey preferences of previous coastal inhabitants. Proportionally more of the fulmar material was uncovered at proportionally more sites in N Norway, findings consistent with current species' distributions, and with speculation of similar oceanographic conditions in previous millenia...|$|R
5|$|In 1962, Melbourne {{began the}} year's {{activities}} at the Royal Hobart Regatta, before sailing to her Strategic Reserve deployment, by way of Adelaide and Fremantle. After Strategic Reserve duties were completed, the carrier visited Japan, Guam, and Manus Island before returning to Sydney in late July. In September, Melbourne reprised her role {{as the leader of}} Exercise Tuckerbox II. The 10,000th catapult launch from Melbourne occurred in late 1962. The carrier's annual refit began in Sydney on 1 October. At the beginning of 1963, Melbourne again visited to the Royal Hobart Regatta, which was immediately followed by a deployment to the Strategic Reserve, including involvement in SEATO Exercise Sea Serpent. The 20,000th landing on Melbourne was performed in April by a <b>Gannet,</b> and in September, Melbourne participated in Exercise Carbine near Hervey Bay, Queensland.|$|E
5|$|The Firth is an {{important}} area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats, shingle shorelines and saltmarsh. The last named, which is well developed on Alloa Inch, is typically dominated by saltmarsh rush, sea club-rush, sea aster and common saltmarsh-grass. The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of shelduck, knot, redshank, great crested grebe, teal and goldeneye. The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds. The Bass Rock has more than 150,000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world. When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which give off 152 tonnes of ammonia per year). The scientific names for this <b>gannet,</b> Sula bassana and Morus bassanus, are derived from the rock. The bird was traditionally known locally as the solan goose, and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species on the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, eider duck and numerous gulls.|$|E
5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} {{have been}} observed swallowing city pigeons in St. James's Park in London. Spokeswoman for the Royal Parks Louise Wood opined that feeding on other birds is more likely with captive pelicans that live in a semi-urban environment and are in constant close contact with humans. However, in southern Africa eggs and chicks of the Cape cormorant are an important food source for great white pelicans. Several other bird species have been recorded in the diet of this pelican in South Africa, including Cape <b>gannet</b> chicks on Malgas Island as well as crowned cormorants, kelp gulls, greater crested terns and African penguins on Dassen Island and elsewhere. The Australian pelican, which is particularly {{willing to take a}} wide range of prey items, has been recorded feeding on young Australian white ibis, and young and adult grey teals and silver gulls. Brown pelicans have been reported preying on young common murres in California as well as the eggs and nestlings of cattle egrets and nestling great egrets in Baja California, Mexico. Peruvian pelicans in Chile have been recorded feeding on nestlings of imperial shags, juvenile Peruvian diving petrels and grey gulls. Cannibalism of chicks of their own species is known from the Australian, brown and Peruvian pelicans.|$|E

Her only connection with Resolute was that the <b>Gannet</b> was launched from the Chatham Dockyard, which was the same dockyard where Resolute was decommissioned. <b>Gannet</b> was launched in 1878 long after the cross Atlantic slave trade was made illegal, and also many years after the American Civil War. Therefore, she was not used in anti-slavery work in connection to these markets. She did, however, patrol the Mediterranean Sea and prevented slave trade there.|$|E

50|$|Abbott's booby (Papasula abbotti) is an {{endangered}} seabird of the sulid family, which includes <b>gannets</b> and boobies. It {{is a large}} booby, smaller than <b>gannets,</b> and is placed within its own monotypic genus. It was first identified from a specimen collected by William Louis Abbott, who discovered it on Assumption Island in 1892.|$|R
50|$|Their white colour helps other <b>gannets</b> to {{identify}} {{one of their}} kind and they can deduce {{the presence of a}} shoal of fish by this diving behaviour; this in turn facilitates group foraging, which makes capturing their prey easier. Northern <b>gannets</b> also forage for fish while swimming with their head under water.|$|R
50|$|The bird family Sulidae {{comprises}} the <b>gannets</b> and boobies. Collectively called sulids, they are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish and similar prey. The ten species {{in this family}} are often considered congeneric in older sources, placing all in the genus Sula. However, Sula (true boobies) and Morus (<b>gannets)</b> can be readily distinguished by morphological and behavioral and DNA sequence characters. Abbott's booby (Papasula) is given its own genus as it stands apart from both in these respects. It {{appears to be a}} distinct and ancient lineage, maybe closer to the <b>gannets</b> than to the true boobies.|$|R
