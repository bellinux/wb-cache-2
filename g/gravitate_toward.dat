5|$|New styles {{such as the}} Maguindanao’s kagungudan and the Maranao’s bago, are {{considered}} fast, rhythmic and showy. Generally genres under this classification have faster tempos {{with an emphasis on}} power and speed, are highly rhythmic and pulsating, and are highly improvised with musicians employing different rhythmic/melodic formulae not used with old patterns. “Young” musicians, specifically young men, <b>gravitate</b> <b>toward</b> this style because of its emphasis on virtuosity and one’s individualism. Generally played after all kamamatuan pieces have been played to give younger musicians the opportunity to participate.|$|E
25|$|Self-verification strivings {{may have}} {{undesirable}} consequences {{for people with}} negative self-views (depressed people and those who suffer from low self-esteem). For example, self-verification strivings may cause people with negative self-views to <b>gravitate</b> <b>toward</b> partners who mistreat them, undermine their feelings of self-worth, or even abuse them. And if people with negative self-views seek therapy, returning home to a self-verifying partner may undo the progress that was made there. Finally, in the workplace, the feelings of worthlessness that plague people with low self-esteem may foster feelings of ambivalence about receiving fair treatment, feelings that may undercut their propensity to insist that they get what they deserve from their employers (see: workplace bullying).|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{experience}} has two sides: {{it implies that}} knowledge is acquired through the senses, and it implies that knowledge is acquired over time. Different traditions of thought have emphasized either {{one or the other}} of these two aspects of experience, with epistemology <b>gravitating</b> <b>toward</b> an idea of experience as perception and political philosophy <b>gravitating</b> <b>toward</b> an idea of experience as repetition. In this paper, I argue that Hume's great innovation consisted in taking the notion of experience traditionally associated with political philosophy and applying it to epistemology. Meanwhile, Kant aimed his critique at the traditional epistemological notion of experience and thus failed to appreciate Hume's originality.  </p...|$|R
25|$|A Christian {{music festival}} (also {{known as a}} Jesus music festival or simply a Jesus festival) is a music festival held by the Christian community, in support of {{performers}} of Christian music. The festivals are characterized by more than just music; many feature motivational speakers and evangelists, and include seminars on Christian spiritual and missions topics, service, and evangelism. They are often viewed as evangelical tools, and small festivals can draw 10 times the crowd of traditional revival meetings. While the central theme of a Christian festival is Jesus Christ, the core appeal of a Christian music festival remains the artists and their music. Critics {{point out that the}} dichotomy of business and religious interests can be problematic for Christian festivals. In similar ways as the Christian music industry in general, festivals can be drawn away from their central theme and <b>gravitate</b> <b>toward</b> commercialization and mainstream acts in an attempt to draw crowds.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} industries, which {{transform}} raw materials into final goods. These industries include a vinegar factory and a wood, and bamboo furniture and hut processing plant in barangay Santos, {{as well as}} rattan shop in Barucboc. Another major observation that {{can be obtained from}} the distribution of business enterprises in the municipality is the presence of activities that caters {{to the needs of the}} agricultural sector or the personal needs and requirements of residents. For instance, there are four business activities concentrated in barangay Arellano, which supply agricultural equipment from nearby municipalities such as Mallig and Roxas. This condition is brought about by the fact that some farmers especially in barangays quite distant from the Poblacion such as Turod and Barucboc have accessibility problems. It was learned also that some business establishments in nearby municipalities provide financial assistance to these farmers, which make farmers <b>gravitate</b> <b>toward</b> these other centers. To cater to the personal needs of the local residents, there are a number of business activities, which provide such services as photo supplies, beauty parlors and video rentals.|$|E
500|$|The aim of {{this group}} was to create an {{independent}} Russian school of music {{in the footsteps of}} Glinka. They were to strive for [...] "national character," [...] <b>gravitate</b> <b>toward</b> [...] "Oriental" [...] (by that they meant near-Eastern) melodies and favor program music over absolute—in other words, symphonic poems and related music over symphonies, concertos and chamber music. To create this Russian style of classical music, Stasov wrote that the group incorporated four characteristics. The first was a rejection of academicism and fixed Western forms of composition. The second was the incorporation of musical elements from eastern nations inside the Russian empire; this was a quality that would later become known as musical orientalism. The third was a progressive and anti-academic approach to music. The fourth was the incorporation of compositional devices linked with folk music. These four points would distinguish the Five from its contemporaries in the cosmopolitan camp of composition.|$|E

500|$|The sonnet {{begins with}} the speaker rhetorically asking {{whether it was the}} [...] "great verse" [...] of his rival poet that had {{prevented}} the speaker from expressing his own [...] "ripe thoughts." [...] According to Duncan-Jones, [...] "the speaker claims to be unable to voice his thoughts of love; they are ready for utterance (ripe), but remain buried (in-hearsed) in his brain because he is intimidated by his rival." [...] However, as Harold Bloom contends, this intimidation is apparently not caused by the artistic skill of his rival. In the opening lines of the sonnet, [...] " [...] charmingly suggests an inhibition through jealousy, not of superior poetic powers, but of encountering the Fair Young Man's portrait in a rival's verses." [...] The significance behind the apparent flattery of this rival's art seems open to interpretation. Kenneth Muir writes: [...] "Whether [...] "the proud full sail of his great verse" [...] is sincere admiration or a hint that it is bombastic is still debated," [...] though contemporary scholars tend to <b>gravitate</b> <b>toward</b> the latter, more sarcastic interpretation. Pequiney, amongst others, asserts that this verse is a derogatory adversion to the ostentatious craft of his opponent, belittling the rival's delusions of grandeur.|$|E

On the critic review aggregator site Metacritic, the album holds {{a score of}} 71/100, based on 39 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favourable" [...] reviews. At Digital Spy, Adam Silverstein commends that [...] "more often than not, Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action is this band sharpening their particular surefire indie to glittering distinction." [...] Commenting on the band's future, {{he says that the}} [...] "half-sorry, half-bitter 'Goodbye Lovers & Friends' is probably not Franz Ferdinand's very last act, even if Kapranos proclaiming in the final seconds 'But this really is the end' would make one awesome blowout. Although after delivering a record as good as this, they can take as long as they want". At The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski wrote positively of the musical differences between many of this album's tracks compared to the band's prior work, adding: [...] "Admittedly, these more nuanced Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action sounds aren't as easily accessible; it's much easier to <b>gravitate</b> <b>toward</b> more familiar raucous post-punk ('Bullet,' 'Right Action') or the Clash-reminiscent punk-funk of 'Evil Eye.' But by expanding its worldview, Franz Ferdinand has very nicely settled onto a path toward career longevity." ...|$|E
500|$|After various failed relationships, Lex finally {{believes}} he has what he wants when he begins a romantic relationship with Lana Lang. In [...] "Hypnotic", {{in an effort to}} stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drives Lana into Lex's arms. Writer Darren Swimmer explains that this was not something that just happened in the series, but something that had been hinted at for many seasons. Rosenbaum admits that Lex had a crush on Lana for many years, but contends that he tried to help Clark win Lana early on—he succeeded. When Clark and Lana's relationship crumbled, because of Clark's deceit, Lex was waiting. Rosenbaum believes that Lana was [...] "tired of the boy and wanted a man around". By contrast, Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad, but the relationship [...] "turned into much more". Kreuk contends that Lana went to Lex because [...] "she knows she will never really love him." [...] Kreuk believes that Lana's relationship with the men in her life was originally motivated by a desire to fill a void in her life that was left after her parents were killed. This need to fill that emptiness was fulfilled in [...] "Void", when Lana took a drug to induce death so that she could see her parents in the afterlife. Upon meeting her parents, Kreuk believes that Lana realized that she no longer needed someone else to fill that hole in her. Kreuk sees this filled void as the reason why Lana would <b>gravitate</b> <b>toward</b> Lex.

The return of Clark's powers in [...] "Hidden", {{as well as the}} secrets and lies that accompany them, caused stress on their relationship. In the series' 100th episode, Clark finally took a chance and told Lana the truth. When it resulted, indirectly, in her death and he was allowed to live the day over again Clark chose not to tell her his secret. In [...] "Hypnotic", in an effort to stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drove Lana into Lex's arms.

2500|$|Gravity, or gravitation, is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} by which all things with mass are brought toward (or <b>gravitate</b> <b>toward)</b> one another, including objects ranging from atoms and photons, to planets and stars.

2500|$|Although L'Engle's early protagonists (including Katherine Forrester, Philippa Hunter and Camilla Dickinson) tend to be, like L'Engle, an only child, later {{ones are}} often {{part of a}} large family, {{possibly}} in reaction to L'Engle's own lonely childhood. [...] Thus, Meg Murry and Vicky Austin each have three siblings, and Polly O'Keefe has six brothers and sisters. Most of her heroines are artists, such as a pianist, a painter and a poet; but Meg Murry O'Keefe is a mathematician, Camilla is an astronomer and Polly O'Keefe's vocation is undetermined. L'Engle's most important male characters (John Austin, Adam Eddington, Calvin O'Keefe and others) tend to <b>gravitate</b> <b>toward</b> science, or more specifically medicine (Charles Bejart, Dennys Murry, etc.). However, some are artists, actors, composers, or members of the clergy. Music is part of the lives of many of the characters, recreationally if not professionally.

2500|$|Plaut and Shallice have {{hypothesized}} that {{units in the}} brain interact {{in such a way}} that semantic features form stable attractors in the space of all possible representations of words. [...] These unit interactions correspond to particular attractor patterns, and if the particular attractor pattern is activated, the network remains in that pattern. [...] However, they hypothesize that when the pattern is distorted, there is a pull on the pattern, and it gravitates toward the correct pattern, almost as if this semantic space is filled with basins, where if one point on the pattern falls to the edge of the basin, it will still <b>gravitate</b> <b>toward</b> the middle. [...] If you lesion this area, the neurons die and the basins change their shape. [...] When this happens, you may now have the same distorted starting pattern that will end up in a neighboring basin, which is a semantically related area, but not the correct one, and this would account for deep dyslexic patients to incorrectly identify [...] "river" [...] as [...] "ocean". [...] Lesions that occur early in the network change the basins that send different semantic words to different areas of the network, whereas if they occur later, the words will be much closer semantically. [...] This may account for severity of the deficit in individual patients.|$|E
60|$|To recapitulate: {{demand and}} supply govern {{the value of}} all things {{which can not be}} indefinitely increased; except that even for them, when {{produced}} by industry, there is a minimum value, determined by the cost of production. But in all things which admit of indefinite multiplication, demand and supply only determine the perturbations of value during a period which can not exceed the length of time necessary for altering the supply. While thus ruling the oscillations of value, they themselves obey a superior force, which makes value <b>gravitate</b> <b>toward</b> Cost of Production, and which would settle it and keep it there, if fresh disturbing influences were not continually arising to make it again deviate.|$|E
