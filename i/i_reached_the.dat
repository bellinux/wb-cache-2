500|$|With [...] over [...] {{still to}} travel before the {{relative}} safety of Hut Point, Crean and Lashly began hauling Evans on the sledge, [...] "eking out {{his life with}} the last few drops of brandy that they still had with them". On 18 February they arrived at Corner Camp, still [...] from Hut Point, with [...] {{only one or two}} days' food rations left and still four or five days' man-hauling to do. They then decided that Crean should go on alone, to fetch help. With only a little chocolate and three biscuits to sustain him, without a tent or survival equipment, Crean walked the distance to Hut Point in 18hours, arriving in a state of collapse to find Atkinson there, with the dog driver Dmtri Gerov. Crean reached safety just ahead of a fierce blizzard, which probably would have killed him, and which delayed the rescue party by a day and a half. Atkinson led a successful rescue, and Lashly and Evans were both brought to base camp alive. Crean modestly played down the significance of his feat of endurance. In a rare written account, he wrote in a letter: [...] "So it fell to my lot to do the 30miles for help, and only a couple of biscuits and a stick of chocolate to do it. Well, sir, I was very weak when <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> hut." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Frazier's {{testimony}} [...] adds, [...] "Just as I said in {{the case}} of Mr. Curly, my initial feeling was, when I first heard about this, that the facts had not been established and we needed to be careful to make sure we understood the facts. As I was in -- in that 48-hour time period read the grand jury presentment, <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that given what had become public about the issues leading up to the presentment and given what was {{said in the}} presentment itself about Coach Paterno's testimony and about what the graduate student said to Coach Paterno, I felt that it would not send the right message if Coach Paterno was able to lead the football team out onto the field of play under those circumstances. So I didn't change my mind {{on the question of whether}} we had established all the key facts that related to Coach Paterno's involvement and/or responsibility. But I had reached the conclusion that, from the standpoint of what the University's values would be interpreted to be by the broader public, that what was known was sufficiently serious as it relates to child sexual abuse that it would send the wrong message about our values as a University if Coach Paterno were allowed to coach as though none of this had ever happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{court ruled}} against Corrie's family on August 28, 2012. In a 62-page verdict, Judge Oded Gershon ruled that Corrie's death was an {{accident}} for which she was responsible, and absolved the IDF of any wrongdoing. The judge ruled that the bulldozer driver and his commander had a very limited field of vision and {{could not possibly have}} seen her. According to the judge [...] "The mission of the IDF force {{on the day of the}} incident was solely to clear the ground.... The mission did not include, in any way, the demolition of homes." [...] The court invoked the principle of the combatant activities exception, as the IDF was attacked in the same area where Corrie was killed a few hours earlier; that Corrie could have avoided the danger and that defendants were not at fault as there was neither intent nor negligence involved in her death. The judge said that the IDF did not violate Corrie's right to life because Corrie had placed herself in a dangerous situation, that Israel's investigation was appropriate and did not contain mistakes, and also criticized the U.S. government for failing to send a diplomatic representative to observe Corrie's autopsy. Gershon said: [...] "I rule unequivocally that the claim that the deceased was intentionally hit by the bulldozer is totally baseless. This was an extremely unfortunate accident. <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that there was no negligence on the part of the bulldozer driver. I reject the suit. There is no justification to demand the state pay any damages. She [...] did not distance herself from the area, as any thinking person would have done. She consciously put herself in harm's way." ...|$|E
