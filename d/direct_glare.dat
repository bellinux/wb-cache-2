40|$|This study {{compared}} the quantitative {{influence of a}} variety of factors on the performance of low-beam headlamps. The factors included were vertical aim, horizontal aim, mounting height, lateral separation, lens dirt, lamp voltage, number of functioning lamps, vehicle type, beam pattern and light source. The following aspects of headlamp performance were considered: visibility of pedestrians, visibility of road delineation, visibility of vehicle reflex reflectors, visibility of rettoreflective traffic signs, visibility of targets near the road expansion point, <b>glare</b> <b>directed</b> towards oncoming drivers, glare reflected from wet pavement towards oncoming drivers, <b>glare</b> <b>directed</b> towards rearview mirrors of preceding vehicles, and foreground illumination. A sales-weighted average US beam pattern, with lamps mounted at sales-weighted average locations, formed the basis for most of the analyses. The results indicate that, from among the factors studied, vertical aim is overwhelmingly {{the most important factor in}} influencing the performance of low-beam headlamps. The second most important factor is the number of functioning lamps. The main implication of this study is that major improvements in current (fixed as opposed to adaptive) low-beam headlighting could be achieved primarily by better control of vertical aim and by use of longer-life headlamps...|$|R

40|$|We {{spend more}} and more time working with computers. When we do so our central visual field lacks {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) features and this leads to reduced binocular control and may result in eye-related symptoms. When other factors such as direct and indirect glare are added to a computer work situation further stress is placed on the visual system and binocular control may be even further reduced and our reading behaviour may also be influenced. These factors are likely to contribute to the vision- and eye symptoms referred to collectively as computer vision syndrome (CVS). Three areas of clinical study are included in the context of using a computer screen for demanding near visual tasks. This research aimed to explore the theoretical relationship between: (1) the importance of centrally placed 3 D features in respect to accommodation and vergence mechanisms; (2) the influence of degraded stimuli and/or degraded retinal image on the quality of binocular vision as an indicator of visual fatigue; (3) the influence of degraded stimuli and/or degraded retinal image on eye movements when reading. Paper I clarified the importance of implementing centrally placed 3 D fixation stimuli to contribute to increase vergence accuracy and fixation stability. Paper II evaluated the influence of disability glare on binocular coordination. The results indicated that binocular coordination increased in instability with the severity of glare and there was a more pronounced effect when lighting condition created <b>direct</b> <b>glare.</b> Paper III described the influence of disability glare on eye movements when reading. It is clear that these eye movements were negatively affected in the direct- and indirect glare lighting conditions. Paper IV evaluated the threshold luminance of <b>direct</b> <b>glare</b> using a subjective response regarding eye symptoms in addition to an evaluation of the effect on binocular coordination as a benchmark. <b>Direct</b> <b>glare</b> of 2000 cd/m 2 was found to decrease the instability of binocular coordination with an increased level of eye pain. In conclusion, these findings argue for a more pronounced relationship between reduced cues of centrally placed 3 D features when working with computers with elevated exposure to disability glare. <b>Direct</b> <b>glare</b> appears to degrade the visibility of the retinal image to such a high degree that it can be identified as the most pronounced inappropriate lighting condition. Evaluation of the luminance threshold of <b>direct</b> <b>glare</b> suggests that it reasonable to recommend that stray light toward the eyes should be significantly lower than 2000 cd/m 2. This research has taken a step in the direction of justifying the importance of following lighting design recommendations in computer work environments...|$|E

The following aspects of headlamp performance were considered: visibility of pedestrians, visibility of pavement delineation, visibility of retroreflective traffic signs, visibility of vehicle rear reflex reflectors, visibility of targets near the road expansion point, <b>glare</b> <b>directed</b> towards oncoming drivers, <b>glare</b> <b>directed</b> towards rearview mirrors of preceding drivers, glare reflected from wet pavement towards oncoming drivers, and foreground illumination.

SHOCC, a sub-hourly occupancy-based control model, provides building energy simulation programs, such as ESP-r, access to advanced behavioural models, such as the Lightswitch 2002 algorithms intended for manual and automated lighting systems. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through annual energy simulations aiming at quantifying the total energy impact of manual control over lights and window blinds. Results show that by enabling manual control, as opposed to using predefined lighting profiles for core zones, total primary energy expenditure is reduced by as much as 62 %. This underlines the importance of defining suitable reference cases for benchmarking the performance of automated lighting controls. Results also show that reduced lighting use through automated control may not always produce anticipated savings in primary energy for indoor climate control; in some cases, reduced lighting use is shown to even increase primary energy expenditure for indoor climate control, trimming down initial primary energy savings in lighting alone.

Measurements were made concerning direct and reflected glare at 834 workplaces, illuminance of work surfaces and luminance characteristics of VDT screens at 659 workplaces. The results indicated that <b>direct</b> <b>glare</b> was present at 18. 9 %, and reflected glare at 32. 1 % of the workplaces surveyed. The illumination levels of work surfaces were between 300 and 1, 000 lx for keyboards or documents and below 500 lx for screens at 62 % of the workplaces. Insufficient illumination level as low as 300 lx on a keyboard or document were founded at 19. 3 % of the workplaces. Correlation analysis of illumination levels revealed that a keyboard illuminance above 750 lx resulted in an excessive vertical illuminance on screen above 5 OO lx. Most screens (73. 8 %) showed a character-background luminance ratio ranging from 3 to 15. Only 13. 8 % of the screens surveyed were, however, above 10 cd/㎡ as to the background luminance.

40|$|Venetian blinds {{are common}} type of shading devices and are {{increasingly}} operated automatically to overcome the limitations of using manual operation. Automated blinds need to be controlled to maximize benefits of daylight on the aspects of redirecting sunlight, occupant comfort and energy consumption. However, the common control methods are focused on minimizing negative impacts of daylight, but they might fail to maximize the positive impacts of daylight. They may often inaccurately predict a blind’s position, resulting in the undesirable blockage of useful daylight needed. This paper puts forward a new control method for automated venetian blinds to optimize the utility of daylight. The proposed control method can not only protect occupants from <b>direct</b> solar <b>glare</b> but also maximize daylight penetration into office rooms based on algorithmic methods. The proposed control method is designed to reflect the incident sunlight into the ceiling, then the reflected light acts as a main source of light for the occupants. The reflecting slats respond to the sun altitudes parametrically, in an individual heliotropic response, which can keep the reflected light relatively steady during daytime. Consequently, this process can exploit the optimal use of natural daylight as a main source of lighting and provide shade simultaneously...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parametric study about daylight autonomy and electric lighting consumption {{in a typical}} open-plan (landscape) office space located at high latitude. The parameters studied include: furniture, climates and latitude, orientations, glazing-to-wall ratios (GWR), Venetian blind use and electric lighting control systems. The study is carried out using DAYSIM, {{which is based on}} the validated backward raytracing simulation program RADIANCE. The results indicate that the furniture can significantly reduce daylight autonomy, especially at the back of a deep room, and this parameter must therefore be considered seriously in future simulation work. Furthermore, the results show that daylight autonomy is good to excellent in Stockholm-Östersund and good in Kiruna for work stations next to the window, even on North facades. The North façade has the advantage of no <b>direct</b> sunlight <b>glare</b> compared to South. However, daylight autonomy is much more limited on the North orientation for work stations located a few meters away from the window, which suggests that deep open-plan offices with North orientation should generally be avoided. An examination of electric lighting pattern use confirmed results of earlier studies i. e. the selection of control strategy for the electric lighting system {{is more important than the}} selection of GWR and that the occupancy switch on/off system yields the highest energy use while a perfectly commissioned photoelectric dimming system can achieve very significant energy savings for all GWR, orientations and climates, compared to a manual switch at the door...|$|R
40|$|Behavioural models {{derived from}} {{on-going}} field studies {{can provide the}} basis for predicting personal action taken to adjust lighting levels, remedy <b>direct</b> <b>glare,</b> and save energy in response to physical conditions. Enabling these behavioural models in advanced lighting simulation programs, such as DAYSIM and the Lightswitch Wizard, allows for a more realistic estimate of lighting use under dynamic conditions. The current downside of these approaches is that the whole building energy impact of manual changes in blind settings and lighting use, including its effect on heating and cooling requirements, is not considered. A sub-hourly occupancy-based control model (SHOCC), which enables advanced behavioural models within whole building energy simulation, is presented. The considered behavioural models are the Lightswitch 2002 algorithms for manual and automated light and blind control, while the investigated whole building energy simulation program is ESP-r. The enhanced functionality is demonstrated through annual energy simulations aiming at quantifying the total energy impact of manual control over lights and window blinds. Results show that building occupants that actively seek daylighting rather than systematically relying on artificial lighting can reduce overall primary energy expenditure by more than 40 %, when compared to occupants who rely on constant artificial lighting. This underlines the importance of defining suitable reference cases for benchmarking the performance of automated lighting controls. Results also show that, depending on the proportion of buildings occupants that actively seek out daylighting, reduced lighting use through automated control may not always produce anticipated savings in primary energy for indoor climate control. In some cases, reduced lighting use is shown to even increase primary energy expenditure for indoor climate control, trimming down initial primary energy savings in lighting alone. This reveals the superiority of integrated design approaches over simpler daylighting guidelines or rules of thumb...|$|E
40|$|Advanced façades {{include a}} {{combination}} of active and passive solar shading and daylight harvesting systems to reduce energy demand while maintaining occupant comfort. A comprehensive simulation study was carried out to evaluate the impact of an advanced dynamic shading configuration on the thermal and daylighting performance of building perimeter zones. The studied system consists of a fixed exterior reflective overhang and a movable internal light-shelf in the upper window section as well as controlled bottom-up roller shades in the view aperture. The overhang provides partial exterior shading, blocking solar gains in the summer, and reflects natural light into the room through the upper portion of the façade. The movable internal light-shelf not only blocks sunlight from entering the room through the top window, but also enhances daylight distribution in the room {{as a result of}} deeper natural light penetration. However, if no additional shading is provided for the view aperture, glare and overheating are bound to happen, offsetting the energy benefits, and resulting in occupant discomfort. Controlled bottomup roller shades were therefore employed in the view aperture so as to eliminate <b>direct</b> <b>glare</b> and allow partial view to the outside. The bottom-up controlled shades and the light-shelf are appropriately controlled so as to always block direct sunlight. The study was conducted for a classroom located in Chicago, IL, and the impact of the following parameters on energy demand was investigated: exterior overhang characteristics; interior light shelf position, size, surface reflectance and tilt angle control; roller shade control modes and fabric material properties. ^ In order to accurately model solar gains and exterior luminous sources for the entire year, the façade was split in three variable parts depending on the position of the shades and the relative position of the overhang. In this time-varying 9 -surface enclosure, dynamic view factors were calculated between all surfaces throughout the year. For the thermal analysis, a comprehensive thermal network (heat balance) model was developed, and solved explicitly using the finite difference method to quantify the impact of the above parameters on the building’s thermal loads. A parametric analysis of the studied variables allows for selection of overhang and light shelf characteristics and suitable shade fabric to reduce building energy demand. It was observed that the implementation of the system can result in up to 43 % and 16 % reduction in annual cooling and heating demand respectively. Moreover, peak heating and cooling demands were cut down by 50 % and 32 % in that order. In the daylighting analysis, a multiple bounce radiosity method was used to determine hourly horizontal work plane illuminance and daylight autonomy. Energy savings resulting from the implementation two lighting control strategies (on/off control and continuous dimming) were also evaluated. Compared with standard automated interior roller shades, the studied system provides better natural light distribution, lower contrast ratios and longer periods of view to the outside. Lighting energy savings reached 45 % with on/off electric lighting control, and up to 70 % with continuous dimming control. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is to investigate and propose a direct method to assess daylighting quality of learning spaces in sub-tropical China. Previous {{work in the field}} shows the knowledge gap of understanding the quality of daylighting and the relationship between quality and quantity of daylighting in learning spaces, and the lack of a direct tool to assess the daylighting quality of learning space. In order to establish a comprehensive analysis method by computer simulation on quality of daylighting in learning spaces, the research includes a three-part study of discomfort glare analysis. In {{the first part of the}} study is conducted a validation of the RADIANCE-based glare analysis software Evalglare. The validation involves image-based lighting analysis procedures that operate with high dynamic range (HDR) luminance data for advanced simulation assessment. Vertical illuminace at eye level (Ev) calculated from HDR photos by two sets of different cameras (Nikon Coolpix 4500 with Fisheye lens FCE 8 and iPhone 5 c with Photojojo Super Fisheye lens), from simulated HDR images and Ev measured from reality are compared to determine the accuracy of the core components used in the development of proposed daylight glare assessment method. The Evalglare is validated with a reliable accuracy, and the data generated from HDR photos captured by iPhone 5 c with Super Fisheye lens camera set was found with sufficient accuracy to use for daylight glare assessment. The second part of the study describes and discusses results and findings gathered from the investigation of factors affecting daylight glare in learning spaces of sub-tropical china. This investigation is based on the simulation result of selected views of nine points evenly dividing the space of various learning spaces and results of a questionnaire survey. The learning spaces of 6 schools out of 42 reviewed schools are selected to perform daylight glare simulation for studying the design factors affecting daylight glare assessment. This part of study then summarizes the relationship between DGP and time and date, the impact of different orientation on DGP scores, and the relationship between DGP and different positions of a learning space. In order to examine the sufficiency of DGP method in an Asian context, the result of a user survey for the learning spaces of a school in Hong Kong and the results of computer simulation are also compares and discusses. A “division” concept is also developed to apply DGP method with a new daylight glare comfort classification for the glare assessment of learning spaces. The final part of the study outlines the development and validation of the proposed new <b>direct</b> daylight <b>glare</b> assessment tool, which is developed by integration of the codes of three major open sources. The performance and accuracy are tested to ensure this new tool is sufficient for the glare assessment of learning spaces in the post occupancy stage. To conduct the <b>direct</b> daylight <b>glare</b> assessment method is successful for glare control of learning spaces during the design stage, which has an important role in determining the daylight glare condition for ensure good daylighting quality of learning space in subtropical China. The direct assessment tool is useful for glare detection and shading design for existing or built learning spaces that were not well designed with consideration of daylight glare. The use of this direct assessment tool can provide an interactive and user friendly control for designers to better understand the daylight quality of a space, and will have a significant impact on the improvement of efficiency of daylight glare evaluation for built space. published_or_final_versionArchitectureDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
50|$|The {{daylight}} credit was updated in LEED v4 {{to include a}} simulation option for daylight analysis that uses Spatial Daylight Autonomy (SDA) and Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE) metrics to evaluate daylight quality in LEED projects. SDA is a metric that measures the annual sufficiency of daylight levels in interior spaces and ASE describes the potential for visual discomfort by <b>direct</b> sunlight and <b>glare.</b> These metrics are approved by IES and described at the LM-83-12 standard. LEED recommend a minimum of 300 lux for at least 50% of total occupied hours {{of the year for}} 55% or more square meters (square feet) of the floor occupied area. The threshold recommended by LEED for ASE is that no more than 10% of regularly occupied floor area can be exposed to more than 1000 lux of direct sunlight for more than 250 hours per year. Additionally, LEED requires window shades to be closed when more than 2% of a space is subject to direct sunlight above 1000 lux. According to Reinhart the direct sunlight requirement is a very stringent approach that can disable good daylight design from achieving this credit. Reinhart propose the application of the direct sunlight criterion only in spaces that require stringent control of sunlight (e.g. desks, white boards and etc.).|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes and validates a {{daylighting}} design sequence for sidelit spaces. Since {{the design}} sequence uses the daylight factor as a performance metric, it is aimed towards spaces that primarily receive diffuse daylight.

The sequence interconnects and refines earlier proposed rules of thumb and {{is intended to be}} used during the earliest design stages when concepts regarding programming, floor plans, massing and window areas are initially explored. All steps within the sequence were ‘validated' using Radiance simulations of over 2300 sidelit spaces. During step one of the sequence the effective sky angles are calculated and target daylight factors are defined for all potential daylit zones within a building. In step two a refined version of the ‘daylight feasibility study' is used to help the design team to identify building zones with high daylighting potential based on a target mean daylight factor criterion. During step three suitable interior room dimensions and surface reflectances are determined using a combination of the Lynes' limiting depth, ‘no sky line', and window-head-height rules of thumb. Step four provides a more accurate estimate of the required glazing area for each zone based on the Lynes daylight factor formula which is also validated as part of this work. The effect of external obstructions is considered throughout the process.

The glare illumi-nances were measured for 12 common glare situations that were de ned by a full factorial combination of three scenarios (oncoming driver, center rearview mirror of a preceding driver, or driver-side mirror of a preceding driver one lane to the right), two longitudinal distances (25 m or 50 m), and two vertical locations (illuminated vehicle being either a car or a light truck/van/sport utility vehicle). The measurements were made outdoors at night on asphalt pavement. The median illuminances (not taking into account window transmittance or mirror re ectance) ranged from 0. 5 lux for an oncoming driver of a light truck/van/sport utility vehicle at a distance of 50 m, to 3. 4 lux at the driver-side mirror of a preceding car at 25 m one lane to the right. The ratios of the maxima and the minima measured for each of the 12 glare situations were large, ranging from about 5 : 1 to 36 : 1. The median actual illuminances were compared to the median expected illuminances based on a recent, laboratory-measured, representative sample of US low-beam patterns, taking into account the possible effects of dirt, voltage, misaim, and pavement re ectance. This analysis indicates that the actual illuminances could be very well modeled using the laboratory-measured beam patterns and assuming a linear relationship between the light output of clean and dirty headlamps.

40|$|The sun is most {{hazardous}} to drivers {{when it is}} close to the horizon, particularly within an hour time frame after sunrise (dawn) and before sunset (dusk). The position of the sun and the angle of the rays during this period can render sun visors inadequate. As a result, the risk of having an accident is increased, due to the interference with a driver?s ability to see the road ahead. This paper discusses a Geographic Information Systems-based methodology, which was used to determine the areas of the City of Cape Town road network that are exposed to direct sunlight (sun glare); thus creating a road safety risk. For an arbitrary position in the roadway alignment of the study area, the amount of sun glare risk for drivers was analysed for the 2014 equinox and solstice days. The results revealed that approximately 14. 7 % of the road network in the autumnal equinox and spring equinox is exposed to <b>direct</b> sunlight (sun <b>glare</b> risk), while 12. 2 % and 15. 2 % are exposed in the winter solstice and summer solstice, respectively. A case study carried out in one of the Cape Town streets proved that the methodology produces valid and reliable results. Therefore, results from this procedure can be an informative dimension to consider when evaluating existing roads or layout and alignment alternatives for new roads. In addition, the methodology can also be incorporated into car navigation systems to provide automated real-time sun glare risk information to drivers.
