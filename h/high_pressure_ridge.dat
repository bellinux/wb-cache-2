5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August28 and entered into the Atlantic Ocean. Initially, the wave had moderate amounts of deep convection and was already well organized, which allowed it to quickly become a tropical cyclone. Based on ship reports, the wave was classified as Tropical Depression Ten beginning at 1200UTC on August30. Located 1,000miles (1,609km) southeast of Tropical Storm Felix, the depression tracked westward as a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>ridge</b> formed between the two storms. Satellite imagery showed the depression developing a good outflow pattern. As a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gabrielle on August31. It was noted that by as early as 1200UTC later that day, Gabrielle was already rather large and well-defined. Gabrielle continued to move westward at 17mph (27km/h), and by early on September1, the storm was upgraded to a hurricane. However, the storm was not operationally upgraded to a hurricane until late on September2; Gabrielle was then located about 625miles (1006km) west of Cape Verde.|$|E

Analyses of the vertical structure of temperature and wind from the National Center for Atmospheric Prediction’s (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) provided high resolution depictions of what occurred during these warm periods.

Here, we demonstrate {{the importance of the}} weather situation, together with the route and altitude of the aircraft through this, on estimating contrail coverage. The results have implications for determining the climate impact of contrails as well as potential mitigation strategies. Twenty-one years of re-analysis data are used to produce a climatological assessment of conditions favorable for persistent contrail formation between 200 and 300 hPa over the north Atlantic in winter. The seasonal-mean frequency of cold ice-supersaturated regions is highest near 300 hPa, and decreases with altitude. The frequency of occurrence of ice-supersaturated regions varies with large-scale weather pattern; the most common locations are over Greenland, on the southern side of the jet stream and around the northern edge of <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>ridges.</b> Assuming aircraft take a great circle route, as opposed to a more realistic time-optimal route, is likely to lead to an error in the estimated contrail coverage, which can exceed 50 % for westbound north Atlantic flights.

40|$|Postglacial {{expansion}} of deciduous oak woodlands of the Zagros—Anti-Taurus Mountains, a major biome of the Near East, was delayed {{until the middle}} Holocene at ~ 6300 cal. yr BP. The current hypotheses explain this delay {{as a consequence of}} a regional aridity during the early Holocene, slow migration rates of forest trees, and/or a long history of land use and agro-pastoralism in this region. In the present paper, support is given to a hypothesis that suggests different precipitation seasonalities during the early Holocene compared with the late Holocene. The oak species of the Zagros—Anti-Taurus Mts, particularly Quercus brantii Lindl., are strongly dependent on spring precipitation for regeneration and are sensitive to a long dry season. Detailed analysis of modern atmospheric circulation patterns in SW Asia during the late spring suggests that the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) intensification can modify the amount of late spring and/or early summer rainfall in western/northwestern Iran and eastern Anatolia, which could in turn have controlled the development of the Zagros—Anti-Taurus deciduous oak woodlands. During the early Holocene, the northwestward shift of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) could have displaced the subtropical anticyclonic belt or associated <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>ridges</b> to the northwest. The latter could, in turn, have prevented the southeastward penetration of low pressure systems originating from the North Atlantic and Black Sea regions. Such atmospheric configuration could have reduced or eliminated the spring precipitation creating a typical Mediterranean continental climate characterized by winter-dominated precipitation.

At this point in time, Percy was located [...] east of Fongafale, Tuvalu, and was moving towards the east-southeast at 14 kt (16mph, 26km/h). On February 26, Percy reached Category 1 status, while located 400miles (644km) north of American Samoa. While Percy moved east-southeast, a shortwave trough developed southwest of the storm. The trough caused the cyclone to intensify even further to a Category3 storm as it passed between Fakaofa and Swains Island.

40|$|Achieving a plasma sprayed {{cast iron}} coating {{containing}} graphite requires stringent control on spray parameters that synergistically influence the coating properties {{and thus the}} performance. The microstructure of cast iron splats greatly depends on spray parameters such as substrate temperature, chamber pressure, and spray distance. This paper presents the effect of chamber pressure on the splat microstructure, including oxides and graphite. At low chamber pressures, most splats exhibit a disk shape with high flattening ratios, whereas star-shaped splats extensively appear at <b>high</b> chamber <b>pressures.</b> Spraying at <b>high</b> chamber <b>pressures</b> causes the formation of pores and thick oxide zones at the splat/substrate interface, mainly due to the atmospheric gases, which are responsible for a decrease in splat adhesion.

5000|$|Part {{of the air}} {{rising at}} 60° {{latitude}} diverges at high altitude toward the poles and creates the polar cell. The rest moves toward the equator where it collides at 30° latitude with the high-level air of the Hadley cell. There it subsides and strengthens the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>ridges</b> beneath. A {{large part of the}} energy that drives the Ferrel cell is provided by the polar and Hadley cells circulating on either side and that drag the Ferrel cell with it. The Ferrel cell, theorized by William Ferrel (1817-1891), is therefore a secondary circulation feature, whose existence depends upon the Hadley and polar cells on either side of it. It might be thought of as an eddy created by the Hadley and polar cells. The Ferrel cell is weak, and the air flow and temperatures within it are variable. For this reason, the mid-latitudes are sometimes known as the [...] "zone of mixing." [...] At high altitudes, the Ferrel cell overrides the Hadley and Polar cells. The air of the Ferrel cell that descends at 30° latitude returns poleward at the ground level, and as it does so it deviates toward the east. In the upper atmosphere of the Ferrel cell, the air moving toward the equator deviates toward the west. Both of those deviations, {{as in the case of}} the Hadley and polar cells, are driven by conservation of angular momentum. As a result, just as the easterly Trade Winds are found below the Hadley cell, the Westerlies are found beneath the Ferrel cell. The forces driving the flow in the Ferrel cell are weak, and so the weather in that zone is variable. Thus, strong high-pressure areas which divert the prevailing westerlies, such as a Siberian high, can override the Ferrel cell, making it discontinuous.|$|R

Topography can force a surface low when dense {{low-level}} <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> system <b>ridges</b> in east of a north-south mountain barrier. [...] Mesoscale convective systems can spawn surface lows which are initially warm core. [...] The disturbance can grow into a wave-like formation along the front and the low will be positioned at the crest. Around the low, flow will become cyclonic, by definition. This rotational flow will push polar air equatorward west of the low via its trailing cold front, and warmer air will push poleward low via the warm front. Usually the cold front will move at a quicker pace than the warm front and “catch up” with it due to the slow erosion of higher density airmass located out ahead of the cyclone and the higher density airmass sweeping in behind the cyclone, usually resulting in a narrowing warm sector. [...] At this point an occluded front forms where the warm air mass is pushed upwards into a trough of warm air aloft, which is also known as a trowal (a trough of warm air aloft). [...] All developing low pressure areas share one important aspect, that of upward vertical motion within the troposphere.
