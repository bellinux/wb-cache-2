5|$|After seeing Marge and Ruth again while cooking {{breakfast on}} his car engine, Wiggum {{continues}} his chase of the two, aided by other Springfield Police vehicles. After noticing a cliff ahead, Homer believes that Marge and Ruth are attempting suicide because of him and, using a megaphone, apologizes to Marge for all the mistakes he has made in their marriage and urges them not to drive into the chasm. Ruth, who had not noticed the chasm, slams on the brakes and stops in time; however, Homer and Wiggum fail to stop and fly over the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> only to crash into a landfill. The episodes ends {{with a description of}} the fates of each of the characters involved in the episode.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 1935, the {{building}} shifted to within 2.5 {{feet from the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> following a landslide caused by a severe storm. The warden at the time, James A. Johnston, proposed extend the seawall next to it and asked the Bureau for $6500 to fund it; he would later claim to dislike {{the building}} because it was irregularly shaped. A smaller, cheaper riprap was completed {{by the end of}} 1935. A guard tower and a catwalk from Hill Tower was added to the roof of the Industries Building in June 1936 and the building was made secure with bars from old cells to bar the windows and grill the roof ventilators and to prevent inmates from escaping from the roof. It ceased use as a laundry in 1939 when it was moved to the upper floor of the New Industries Building. Today the building is heavily rusted after decades of exposure to the salt air and wind, and neither the guard tower on top of the building nor the Hill Tower still exist.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{hearing the}} noise of explosions, the on-duty U.S. {{technicians}} rushed {{out the front door}} of their operations building where they were met by North Vietnamese gunfire. Blanton, the U.S. commander at Lima Site 85, was killed alongside two other U.S. technicians. Those who were not killed retreated to {{the west side of the}} mountain, where they hid on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b> From their hideout, the U.S. technicians fired on the North Vietnamese with their M-16 rifles and hand grenades. At 04:15, in response to the gunfire from the U.S. technicians, Muc ordered Cell 5 to reinforce Cell 3, and they captured the TACAN installation at 04:30 after 45 minutes of fighting. Meanwhile, Cell 4 had great difficulties in their attempt to seize the airstrip, where they were blocked by a Hmong mortar position. Le Ba Chom, the commander of Cell 4, was isolated from the other three soldiers of his cell. To avoid being captured alive by the numerically superior Hmong forces, Chom and his soldiers held onto their position and fought till daybreak.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to heavy}} seas and {{the fog of}} battle, Lomell’s landing craft arrived thirty-five minutes late, away from its mark, and lost any element of surprise. Those who made it down the ramp or over the side had to swim inland about 20 feet. As Lomell was {{bringing}} in a box of rope and a hand-projector rocket, he {{was wounded in the}} side by a machine-gun bullet, but reached shore without pausing. First Sergeant Lomell {{reached the top of the}} cliff through the use of two ladders, and along with eleven other men from his landing craft, moved off of the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b>|$|E
25|$|As well as {{a source}} of galena, the mine near Port Gorey {{returned}} both lead and silver. Discovered by chance during a rabbit hunt in 1836, industry around this mine led to the construction of a small gauge railway and the installation of steam pumps. The mine is believed to have had a length of 2,000 feet/600m and depth of 700 feet/200m. Close to the port there were four shafts leading to the galleries. Sark's Hope shaft was the westernmost, almost on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b> To the East was Le Pelley shaft, excavated down to 90fathoms below sea level, then the Pump shaft and the easternmost shaft, the Prince's shaft.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Kilwa Kisiwani was {{inscribed on}} UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger. There {{is a serious}} rapid {{deterioration}} of the archaeological and monumental heritage of these two islands due to various agents like erosion and vegetation. The eastern section of the Palace of Husuni Kubwa, for example, is progressively disappearing. The damage to the soil caused by rainwater wash is accentuating the risks of collapse of the remaining structures on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b> The vegetation that proliferates on the cliff has limited the progression of the rain-wash effect, but causes the break-up of the masonry structures. The World Monuments Fund included Kilwa on its 2008 Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites, and since 2008 has been supporting conservation work on various buildings.|$|E
25|$|Völkermarkt is sited on a cliff {{overlooking}} the river Drau. In 1090 Volko of Rheinfranken {{laid out a}} trading town for Ulrich II, Duke of Carinthia. Then in 1217 a bridge was built over the Drau. Today {{there is virtually no}} evidence for the fortifications apart from fragments of wall and a tower on the SE <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b> However two Merian prints show that the town was fully walled with gate towers on the E and W. On the flatter land to the N the wall was angled and there was a prominent round tower. On the craggy promontory to the S there was another gate tower with a road leading to the Drau bridge. The town had a large rectangular market place that has been encroached upon by buildings.|$|E
25|$|From 22 January, the {{day before}} the attack on No.3 Redoubt, Pratt began {{employing}} the Royal Engineers to systematically apply the technique of sapping to advance towards Te Arei. Excavating through night and day under frequent fire, Pratt's sap extended 768 yards and crossed the rifle pits of the Huirangi pā, prompting Māori to abandon the pā and fall back on Pukerangiora. Despite widespread criticism for his slowness and caution, Pratt pressed on towards Te Arei, creating the most extensive field-engineering works ever undertaken by British troops in New Zealand. Five more redoubts were built as the saps continued to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> above the Waitara River, but ceased after the intervention of Kingite chief Wiremu Tamihana, who helped negotiate a truce. A ceasefire was formally effected on 18 March 1861, ending {{the first phase of the}} Taranaki War. For his actions on 18 March, Colour-Sergeant John Lucas was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E

25|$|The {{geographer}} Pausanias {{records that}} Athena placed the infant Erichthonius {{into a small}} chest (cista), which she entrusted {{to the care of}} the three daughters of Cecrops: Herse, Pandrosos, and Aglauros of Athens. She warned the three sisters not to open the chest, but did not explain to them why or what was in it. Aglauros, and possibly one of the other sisters, opened the chest. Differing reports say that they either found that the child itself was a serpent, that it was guarded by a serpent, that it was guarded by two serpents, or that it had the legs of a serpent. In Pausanias's story, the two sisters were driven mad by the sight of the chest's contents and hurled themselves off the Acropolis, dying instantly, but an Attic vase painting shows them being chased by the serpent off the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> instead. Erichthonius {{was one of the most}} important founding heroes of Athens and the legend of the daughters of Cecrops was a cult myth linked to the rituals of the Arrhephoria festival.|$|E
500|$|In {{the scene}} when Jack is {{dangling}} from the cliff, Matthew Fox performs the stunt himself, as he considered that relying on stunt doubles [...] "always sort of inhibits the director's ability to shoot it in cool ways." [...] Fox dangled from a thirty foot high cliff {{in front of a}} blue screen, that through digital extensions appeared to be hundreds of feet high. However, Fox's long time stunt actor, Steve Blalock, performed Jack's rolling down the mountain before grabbing the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff,</b> given Fox considered that [...] "there are some things that I'm not gonna be able to do".|$|E
500|$|As {{the episode}} begins, [...] "Mulder" [...] and Gibson Praise are cornered {{at the edge}} of a {{mountain}} by pursuing agent John Doggett. Suddenly, [...] "Mulder" [...] walks off the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> and appears to fall to his death; however, when the FBI agents are sent down to retrieve his body, they find that it has disappeared. Dana Scully realizes that what appeared to be her partner was actually an Alien Bounty Hunter sent to retrieve Praise. The Bounty Hunter, who has returned to the school, continues his search for Praise. Meanwhile, Scully follows a girl, Thea (Christine Firkins), she had previously observed to be Praise's friend throughout the desert until she is able to locate Praise. After Doggett explains the events on the clifftop to Alvin Kersh, Walter Skinner tells him that Kersh is setting him up to fail. Shortly afterwards, the Bounty Hunter (now disguised as agent Scully) attacks Agent Landau. Skinner and the real Scully eventually manage to drive the alien away.|$|E

500|$|Blair did {{not want}} Livingstone as London Mayor, {{claiming}} the latter {{was one of those}} who [...] "almost knocked [...] over the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> into extinction" [...] during the 1980s. He and the Labour spin doctors organised a campaign against Livingstone to ensure that he was not selected, with Campbell and Sally Morgan unsuccessfully attempting to get Oona King to denounce Livingstone. They failed to convince Mo Mowlam to stand for the mayorship, and instead encouraged the reluctant Frank Dobson to stand. Recognising that a 'one member, one vote' election within the London Labour Party would probably see Livingstone selected over Dobson, Blair ensured that a third of the votes would come from the rank-and-file members, a third from the trade unions, and a third from Labour MPs and MEPs, the latter two of which he could pressure into voting for his own preferred candidate, something that Dobson was deeply uncomfortable with. Information on the Blairite campaign against Livingstone became public, costing Dobson much support; nevertheless, due to the impact of the MPs and MEPs, Dobson won the candidacy with 51% to Livingstone's 48%.|$|E
500|$|Maiden Castle has no {{artificial}} defences on {{its northern}} and western sides {{because of the}} naturally steep slope of the hill, {{but there are two}} artificial banks, [...] apart. The banks are similar in dimension, both are [...] wide, and because the ground they are on slopes, the exterior side of each bank is higher than the side {{on the inside of the}} fort; they are [...] high on the inside of the fort and [...] on the exterior face. There is no evidence that Maiden Castle was protected by a ditch along with the banks. The main entrance is on the east side of the fort where the inner bank turns in towards the fort, and while there is a gap in the outer rampart it does not turn in. There may also be two other entrances to the site where the banks meet the cliffs to the north and south; the outer ditch runs inwards at both ends, possibly indicating an in-turned entrance abutting the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> similar to the entrance at the Helsby hill fort also in Cheshire or perhaps an attempt to make the banks run flush to the cliff-edge to ensure there were no gaps in the site's defences.|$|E
2500|$|... 1905 {{development}} {{started the}} first of three quarry openings with #2 in 1905. [...] When Quarry 2 cutting started, none of the workers wanted to hang off the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> sitting on a wooden bench attached to an overhead derrick. [...] So the company president, Channing Meek, came up to the quarry, sat on the wooden bench, was lowered over the mountainside, and started cutting marble. [...] After that no worker refused to go over the side and cut marble. Quarry 2 was followed by #3 in 1907 and #1 in 1912. [...] A fourth opening to the left of #3 (out of view) was started but did not become a producing quarry.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Zuytdorp <b>Cliffs</b> are {{composed}} of Pleistocene aged limestone, a formation called the Tamala Limestone.

2500|$|At {{the eastern}} end of Shippen Street a double hairpin road begins, {{connecting}} the steep grade from Shippen Street to Hackensack Plank Road. It has been called [...] "The Horseshoe" [...] and [...] "Lombard Street of the East Coast". With Hackensack Plank Road already in decades worth of usage and regularity and Shippen Street residential properties extending to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> side, transportation planners and engineers were left little option to connect the two street other than creating a hairpin style turn portion, whereas a perpendicular intersection between the two roads would have created too great of a slope gradient for pedestrians, carriages or automobiles to traverse safely. It was placed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places on December 8, 1997 under its list of historic preservation sites.|$|E
2500|$|The Zambezi river, {{upstream}} from the falls, experiences a rainy season from late November to early April, and a dry season {{the rest of}} the year. The river's annual flood season is February to May with a peak in April,/s (318,000 cu ft) is quoted by many websites for Victoria Falls but this is the mean maximum instantaneous rate, which is only achieved for a few days per year. The figure of 536 million m3/minute (18.9 billion cu ft/min) on some websites (e.g. ZNTB) is an error for 536 million litres/minute (equivalent to 9100 m3/s or 142 million U.S. gallons/min). The '10-year maximum' is the mean of the maximum monthly rate returned in a ten-year period. The spray from the falls typically rises to a height of over 400 metres (1,300ft), and sometimes even twice as high, and is visible from up to [...] away. At full moon, a [...] "moonbow" [...] {{can be seen in the}} spray instead of the usual daylight rainbow. During the flood season, however, it is impossible to see the foot of the falls and most of its face, and the walks along the cliff opposite it are in a constant shower and shrouded in mist. Close to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff,</b> spray shoots upward like inverted rain, especially at Zambia's Knife-Edge Bridge.|$|E
