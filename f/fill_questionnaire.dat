40|$|Introduction: A {{practical}} exam {{is important}} for evaluation of university students {{but there is not}} any satisfaction of traditional exams among clinical teachers. There are limited studies done for modification of traditional exams. This study aimed to compare the traditional and Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) exams in term of clinical skills and satisfaction among dental students. Methods: Evaluation of thirty dental students was done with OSCE and traditional exams. A student was undergone oral medicine exam in the traditional form (10 questions) and OSCE (with ten stations). After the exam they <b>fill</b> <b>questionnaire</b> regarding their experience of the two methods. Data was analyzed with SPSS V. 18. Mann-Whitney test, T test, chi square and Pearson correlation coefficient were used. Results: In the OSCE group, scores of questions in the field of cognition was higher and psychomotor was lower than the traditional exam (p= 0. 001). OSCE is better stimulator of clinical situations and its stressful environment. Conclusion: Despite mismatch found between traditional exams and medical educational goals, most of universities apply this method. it is recommended to use OSCE method in evaluation of all fields of dentistry...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} to determine the factor of farmer shifting in varieties of coconut production. This study was conducted at Muar, Johor for 4 months. The determination of the factor was classified into three independent factors which there are demographic, attitude and market factor which respond to dependent factor which is farmer shifting in variety and was used six parameters to identify the factor. This study also used interview the farmer and questionnaire {{to carry out the}} survey. About 150 coconut farmers were interview and <b>fill</b> <b>questionnaire</b> form at Muar, Johor. The questionnaire was design in 19 questions which 12 question for independent factor, 3 questions for dependent factor and 4 questions for socio profile of farmers. The 5 questions under demographic factor, 4 questions under attitude factor, 3 questions under market factor, and 3 questions for dependent factor. Result of the study showed that the market factor was significant to farmer shifting in variety of coconut production because there had high demand of new variety in the market and high price in current market. For the demographic factor, there is no influence the farmer to shift in the current variety to new variety. This is because most farmers are not frequent to extension program indirectly slow to use the extension service in their coconut production activity. This will make the farmers not gain new information about a certain variety, so this will indicate that demographic factor does not influence the shifting in variety among coconut farmers. For the attitude factor, the result show attitude factor does not influence farmers to shift from current variety to new variety because the incentive provide by the government still cannot support them to shifting from current variety to new variety. The result also showed that the market factor as a domain factor which influence the farmer shifting in varieties in coconut production...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cervical {{cancer is}} known to be {{preventable}} because of long period of pre-invasive stage, availability of screening tools, and effective treatments for early invasive cervical lesions. Screening is main measures to prevent the disease and Pap smear is a screening strategy for cervical cancer. Current paper aimed to evaluate levels of awareness and practice regarding Pap smear screening among women aged between 20 to 65 years in Tehran (Iran). 			Methods: This was a descriptive-analytical study conducted in Tehran City of Iran in 2015 at Firoozgar Hospital. The research population included all married, widowed and divorced women aged 20 - 65 years. Data analysis was performed using the Pearson correlation and Student’s t-tests in SPSS, ver. 23 (Chicago, IL, USA). 			Results: Among 90 individuals who have <b>fill</b> <b>questionnaire</b> completely, 66. 6 % subjects had Pap smear tests. 40 % of the individuals aged between 30 to 39 and the education level is distributed equally between Intermediate, Diploma and graduate and only 3 percent of them, continue their education to higher level. There was a significant relationship between the awareness of Pap smear and educational level (of both wives and husbands). The people who have graduate degree, have the best awareness. Working women revealed higher level of awareness about Pap smear. Shame and fear of taking the cancer were the most common reasons which lead to avoidance in doing the test by the women, while the most encouraging factors for performing the test were the information mostly provided by physicians and after that, the information provided by friends. 			Conclusion: The awareness of Pap smear test which was measured by weighting different questions in the questionnaire by experts, prove that the women aged above 39, have an average level of awareness of Pap smear test. Due to high prevalence of cervical cancer and prolonged pre invasive course, role of Pap smear for early diagnosis necessitate the use of proper and inexpensive instructional methods to increase awareness in women about cervical cancer and preventive strategies...|$|E

40|$|Background Hospital-acquired {{infections are}} {{significant}} cause of {{morbidity and mortality}} among hospitalized patients worldwide. Healthcare workers during job are exposed to blood borne pathogens through contact with infected body parts, blood and body fluids. World health organization (WHO) estimated that globally about 2. 5 % of HIV and 40 % of hepatitis viral infected cases are among health workers due to exposures. The most important mechanism of spread of these pathogens is through contaminated hands of the healthcare workers. Standard precautions measures are essential to prevent and control healthcare associated infection among healthcare workers and patients. In developing countries despite the development of detailed guideline for infection control the knowledge of standard precautions is low and not properly applied. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the knowledge and practice of health care workers regarding standard precautions and hand hygiene to infectious disease control.   Aim The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and practice of health care workers regarding hand wash and standard precautions to control infectious diseases in BMCH. In addition create awareness among participants and encourage them to practice regularly hand hygiene and standard precautions to control or reduce nosocomial infections in health care facilities Methods The study design is cross-sectional evaluation of healthcare worker knowledge and practices about standard precautions and hand hygiene for infectious disease control. A questionnaire administered to health care workers (doctors and nurses). The questionnaire was divided in two parts and the first part concerns demographic information, asking knowledge and practice. The second part asked opinions about risk and prevention of HAIs. The questionnaire was developed with consultation of other studies of the same kind. It has been pre tested and is finalized for survey. The ethical approval was given by hospital superintendent and informs consent from all study participants. Statistic analysis was done on Excel and statistical software SPSS version 20. Data was described in numbers, percentages and Chi Square test done for association among categorical variables, significant level was considered P= < 0. 05. Results Two hundred questionnaires were distributed to HCWs in BMCH and 169 completely <b>fill</b> <b>questionnaire</b> were returned. The male gender respondents were 42 % and female respondents were 58 %. The basic questions about knowledge of hand hygiene and standard precautions were answered well in both categories; about 73 % were with sufficient knowledge. The practice of hand hygiene and standard precautions was not satisfactory among both categories; about 47 % found with good practice. Differences found in sub groups, young age none trained doctors and nurses answered wrong and shown lack of knowledge. This study found an association of age, profession and job experience with knowledge and practice regarding hand hygiene and standard precautions. Open handed questions described well the major issue regarding HAIs and participants emphasized on risk and prevention methods.   Conclusions The respondents were HCWs (doctors and nurses) of both sex and this study found that majority of HCWs have good knowledge and practice about control of HAIs but difference were found in age groups, sex and profession. Above half of the HCWs were not trained for infection control in health facilities, thus getting training of infection control is important but more important is implementation of it during practice. ...|$|E
