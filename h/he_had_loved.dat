5|$|Tiberius's move thus {{seemed to}} be an interim solution: he would hold power only until his stepsons would come of age, and then be swept aside. The promiscuous, and very public, {{behavior}} of his unhappily married wife, Julia, may have also played a part. Indeed, Tacitus calls it Tiberius' intima causa, his innermost reason for departing for Rhodes, and seems to ascribe the entire move to a hatred of Julia and a longing for Vipsania. Tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the Forum, and forbidden to see the woman <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>loved.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ghica's work {{of hidden}} memoirs, the novella Un boem român ("A Romanian Bohemian"), was {{a tale of}} {{adventure}} and unrequited love: its main character, Paul, whose adventures mirror many in Ghica's life, elopes with a married woman, {{only to find that}} she is not faithful to him either. The plot is probably the first one in Romanian literature to discuss the topic of free love. In 1850, Ghica authored a piece in honor of the deceased poet Vasile Cârlova, titled O lacrimă a poetului Cârlova ("One of Poet Cârlova's Tears"). It depicted Cârlova drinking from a skull-shaped cup with the inscription Lina, adu-ţi aminte! ("Lina, remember!", allegedly in honor of a nun <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>loved).</b>|$|E

25|$|On 27 January 2014, it was {{reported}} that a relic of John Paul II, a vial containing drops of his blood, had been stolen from the church of San Pietro della Ienca north of L'Aquila in the mountainous Abruzzo region of central Italy, a region where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>loved</b> to go on skiing vacations. Cardinal Dziwisz had previously given the vial to the church in recognition of its connections to the Pontiff. Because there are only three relics containing his blood, few or no other items were disturbed, and {{it would be difficult to}} sell, the investigating Italian police believe it was a commissioned theft, and speculated that the blood might be used in Satanic rites. The theft sparked a major search for the culprits. Two men confessed to the crime, and an iron reliquary and a stolen cross, but not the relic, were recovered from the grounds of a drug rehabilitation facility in L'Aquila on 30 January; the blood was recovered shortly after from rubbish bins near where the reliquary had been found.|$|E
500|$|He never married.

When this was no longer an issue, she was already married. His pacta conventa specified that he should marry a Polish noblewoman, although he himself always hoped to marry into some royal family.|$|E

500|$|Churchill's final {{departure}} from political office came some sixteen months later when, on 5 April 1955, he chaired his last cabinet, almost fifty {{years since he}} had first sat in the Cabinet Room as President of the Board of Trade in 1908. The following day he held a tea party for staff at Downing Street before driving to Chartwell. On being asked by a journalist on arrival how it felt no longer to be Prime Minister, Churchill replied, [...] "It's always nice to be home". For the next ten years, Churchill spent much time at Chartwell, although both he and Lady Churchill also travelled extensively. His days there were spent writing, painting, playing bezique or sitting [...] "by the fish pond, feeding the golden orfe and meditating". Of his last years at the house, Churchill's daughter, Mary Soames, recalled, [...] "in the two summers that were left to him he would lie in his 'wheelbarrow' chair contemplating {{the view of the}} valley <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>loved</b> for so long". On 13 October 1964, Churchill's last dinner guests at Chartwell were his former principal private secretary Sir Leslie Rowan and his wife. Lady Rowan later recalled, [...] "It was sad to see such a great man become so frail". The following week, increasingly incapacitated, Churchill left the house for the last time. His official biographer Martin Gilbert records Churchill was, [...] "never to see his beloved Chartwell again". After his death in January 1965, Lady Churchill immediately relinquished her lease and presented Chartwell to the National Trust. It was opened to the public in 1966, one year after Churchill's death.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{surviving}} official synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Tom Wilk is a poor country lad, living alone with his stepfather, who ill-treats him. Tom leaves his work one day to follow a circus parade. He is fascinated with {{the wonders of the}} parade and follows it to the circus grounds, around which he stays all morning, and is finally tempted by his great wish to see the show, to crawl under the tent. He is discovered by a circus guard, and ordered off the ground. A small girl, Lillie Lockwood, and her father come to the circus, and witness Tom's ejection. Urged by his daughter, Lillie's father buys Tom a ticket of admission, giving him his first happy day. In return, Tom gives Lillie, as a keepsake, his most treasured possession, his pocket knife. On returning home, Tom is severely chastised by his step-father, after which he decides to run away. He walks to a neighboring town, and is there engaged as an office boy by Gates, a lawyer. After some years of faithful service, in various capacities, Tom becomes a member of the firm. Lillie obtains a position as a stenographer in their office. She and Tom do not recognize each other, until Tom accidentally sees in her hand the little knife he had given her in the long ago. He declares <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>loved</b> her through the years, and has been patiently waiting for her, so the romance that began at the circus finds a happy climax at the altar." ...|$|E

Oram called Daniel [...] "slightly misguided and psychopathic", but he has a good heart. Sara's other friends, Jamie and Justine, are portrayed by Dominic Coleman and Nicola Walker.

2500|$|The plan {{leads to}} what is {{commonly}} called the [...] "Nunnery Scene". Polonius instructs Ophelia {{to stand in the}} lobby of the castle while he and Claudius hide.

2500|$|Lightbody had a [...] "long-term ambition" [...] {{of making}} a country album and {{revealed}} the project's existence in May 2009. In the interview, he expressed his love for country music, which he said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>loved</b> for a long time: [...] "I always thought I had a country album in me {{and it turns out}} I did." [...] The rest of Snow Patrol expressed excitement for their band-mate, [...] "delighted that [...] getting to exercise all his crazy ideas." [...] In October 2009, Lightbody in his blog on Snow Patrol's website revealed the members of the group to be Richard Colburn (of Belle & Sebastian), Iain Archer, singer Miriam Kaufmann (Archer's wife), and Jacknife Lee. He talked about two more members whom he was very excited about, but didn't name them. He also stated that the album won't be country as was being reported, but would be [...] "country-tinged". In January 2010, Hot Press reported Peter Buck (of R.E.M.) {{to be a member of}} the group. Lightbody described Buck as one of his [...] "all-time heroes" [...] and admired his talent for playing a variety of instruments.|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, Corrine Patton {{argued that}} [...] "this text {{does not support}} {{domestic}} abuse; and scholars, teachers, and preachers must continue to remind uninformed readers that such an interpretation is actually a misreading" [...] and that [...] "the theological aim of the passage is to save Yahweh from the scandal of being a cuckolded husband, i.e. a defeated, powerless, and ineffective god. [...] It is a view of God for whom no experience, not even rape and mutilation in wartime, is beyond hope for healing and redemption." [...] Regarding Ezekiel 16, Daniel I. Block wrote that [...] "the backdrop of divine judgment can be appreciated only {{against the backdrop of}} his grace. If the text had begun at v. 36 one might understandably had accused God of cruelty and undue severity. But the zeal of his anger is a reflex of the intensity of his love. God had poured out his love on this woman, rescuing her from certain death, entering into covenant relationship with her, pledging his troth, lavishing on her all the benefits she could enjoy. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>loved</b> intensely. He could not take contempt for his grace lightly." [...] F. B. Huey, Jr., commenting on Jeremiah, wrote, [...] "The crude description is that of the public humiliation inflicted on a harlot, an appropriate figure for faithless Judah. It could also describe the violence done to women by soldiers of a conquering army. [...] Jeremiah reminded [...] {{that they were going to}} be exposed for all to see their adulteries." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hart was {{notorious for}} pulling {{elaborate}} [...] "ribs" [...] (pranks) on fellow wrestlers. During a shoot interview Tony Norris, who wrestled in the WWF during the mid-90's as Ahmed Johnson and faced Hart {{in the ring}} on many occasions, stated that he had {{received a phone call}} saying he was to be featured as a guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. After spending a large amount of money on new clothes for the occasion, he was told a limousine was to pick him up and deliver him to the studio. After waiting a seemingly long time, he says that Hart appeared and asked him why he wasn't at the show yet. Norris, suspicious as to how Hart could've known about his guest appearance as he had not told anyone, said that Hart was then on the ground laughing; he then realized that Hart was behind the ruse and there was no guest spot on The Tonight Show. Despite this, Norris spoke very highly of Hart and said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>loved</b> working with him. During the segments of wrestlers sharing stories about Hart during the RAW IS OWEN broadcast following his death, Shane McMahon mentions Hart and himself taking his brother Bret's wrestling boots and hiding them in a shower. Shane mentioned he was fearful of what Bret would do when he found out. In his autobiography, his brother Bret spoke of a time when he, their father Stu, and Bret's oldest daughter Jade were in a hotel room during the WrestleMania IV weekend when Stu received a phone call apparently from former bodybuilder and wrestler Reg Park, who said that he was calling from the hotel's lobby. [...] Having been acquaintances before, Stu was originally cordial until Park supposedly began accusing him of cowardice and challenging him to a confrontation. [...] Bret mentions Stu becoming extremely irritated to the point of anger and was ready to meet Park face to face until he slammed the phone down, mentioning that it was Owen all along.|$|E
