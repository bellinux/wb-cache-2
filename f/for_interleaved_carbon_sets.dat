40|$|Interleaved {{comparison}} methods, which compare rankers using click data, are {{a promising}} alternative to traditional information retrieval evaluation methods that require expensive explicit judgments. A major limitation {{of these methods}} is that they assume access to live data, meaning that new data must be collected for every pair of rankers compared. We investigate the use of previously collected click data (i. e., historical data) <b>for</b> <b>interleaved</b> comparisons. We start by analyzing to what degree existing interleaved comparison methods can be applied and find that a recent probabilistic method allows such data reuse, {{even though it is}} biased when applied to historical data.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{analyze the}} effect of Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) of {{multiple}} users on the SINR of a single user in OFDMA based uplink communication receiver. We have computed an explicit SINR expression for two types of mapping strategies used in uplink OFDMA systems namely Interleaved Frequency Division Multiple Access (IFDMA) and Localized Frequency Division Multiple Access (LFDMA). SINR expressions in case of carrier frequency offset correction are also computed. Using simulations, we have compared the total average interference due to different values of CFO’s of multiple users for both mapping schemes. Simulation results also show that the average value of Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) for localized mapping is higher than interleaved mapping while the average value of Multiuser Interference (MUI) is higher <b>for</b> <b>interleaved</b> mapping. Moreover, the average MUI for localized mapping is minimum {{at the center of}} the band and it increases as we move towards the band edges.

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} attributes of proton therapy and carbon ion therapy {{is the ability of}} these charged particles to spare tissue distal to the targeted tumor. This significantly reduces normal tissue toxicity and has the potential to translate to a wider therapeutic index. Although, in general, particle therapy also reduces dose to the proximal tissues, particularly {{in the vicinity of the}} target, dose to the skin and to other very superficial tissues tends to be higher than that of megavoltage x-rays. The methods presented here, namely <b>Interleaved</b> <b>carbon</b> minibeams and Radiosurgery with arrays of proton and light ion minibeams, both utilize beams segmented into arrays of parallel minibeams of about 0. 3 mm incident beam size. These minibeam arrays spare tissues, as demonstrated by synchrotron x-ray experiments. An additional feature of particle minibeams is their gradual broadening due to multiple Coulomb scattering as they penetrate tissues. In the case of <b>interleaved</b> <b>carbon</b> minibeams, which do not broaden much, two arrays of planar carbon minibeams that remain parallel at target depth, are aimed at the target from 90 º angles and made to interleave at the target to produce a solid radiation field within the target. As a result the surrounding tissues are exposed only to individual carbon minibeam arrays and are therefore spared. The method was used in four-directional geometry at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory to ablate a 6. 5 -mm target in a rabbit brain at a single exposure with 40 Gy physical absorbed dose. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and histology six month later showed very focal target necrosis with nearly no damage to the surrounding brain. As for minibeams of protons and light ions, for which the minibeam broadening is substantial, measurements at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, and Monte Carlo simulations showed that the broadening minibeams will merge with their neighbors at a certain tissue depth to produce a solid beam to treat the target. The resulting sparing of proximal normal tissue allows radiosurgical ablative treatments with smaller impact on the skin and shallow tissues. This report describes these two methods and discusses their potential clinical applications...|$|R

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (CFRP) composites possess {{many advantages}} for aircraft structures over conventional aluminum alloys: light weight, higher strength- and stiffness-to-weight ratio, and low life-cycle maintenance costs. However, {{the relatively low}} thermal and electrical conductivities of CFRP composites are deficient in providing structural safety under certain operational conditions such as lightning strikes.
