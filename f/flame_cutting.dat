40|$|Abstract. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study heat transfer rate of impinging <b>flame</b> jet and <b>cutting</b> quality of steel plate using <b>flame</b> jet. The <b>cutting</b> torch was used for heating on the impingement surface, and it was used for cutting the steel plate samples. LPG at constant flow rate of 0. 14 kg/s was mixed with pure oxygen at varied flow rate corresponding to equivalence ratio, Φ = 0. 78, 0. 93 and 1. 16. The nozzle-to-plate distance was examined at h= 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 mm. Heat transfer rate on the impingement surface was measured using water cooled heat flux sensor. In order to investigate cutting quality, steel plate with 6 mm in thickness was cut by this <b>flame</b> jet with <b>cutting</b> speed at 260 mm/min. The surface roughness, slag quantity and kerf characteristics were considered for cutting quality. The results show that the flame jet for condition of Φ = 0. 78 at h= 4 mm gives the highest heat transfer rate.

50|$|For small buildings, such as houses, {{that are}} {{only two or three}} stories high, {{demolition}} is a rather simple process.

Wrecking balls are especially effective against masonry, but are less easily controlled and often less efficient than other methods.

40|$|Oxyacetylene <b>flame</b> <b>cutting</b> is a {{relevant}} and widespread industrial process. The {{basic principles of}} the process lie in rapid high-temperature oxidation of the cut metal.

In this present work, a report of the role of carbon on the kinetics of the process is made; effects of the activities of oxyfuel gases on the <b>flame</b> <b>cutting</b> process is also elucidated. This was done by investigation of the effects of carbon content and the cutting pressures on the cutting rates of steels by the oxyacetylene cutting process. Six 10 mm steel rods of different wt% C were flame cut using different acetylene and oxygen pressures. The composition of the steel rods used ranged from 0. 16 wt% C to 0. 33 wt% C, the acetylene pressures used ranged from 3. 45 x 10 - 2 N. m- 2 to 5. 52 x 10 - 2 N. m- 2, while oxygen pressure ranged from 2. 76 x 10 - 1 N. m- 2 to 3. 17 x 10 - 1 N. m- 2.

In the area of sheet metal cutting, the main goal to increase the economic efficiency {{is to reduce the}} very high post processing time. The key role is played by the clearing and separating of parts and residues after the automatic NC controlled <b>flame</b> <b>cutting.</b> According to {{the current state of the}} art, the process of sorting is manually controlled by an worker. Despite the technical support by crane systems and magnet-traverses, manual sheet metal sorting is highly time consuming. Due to the variety of plates for a ship construction, there is a significant need for a solution with automatic sheet metal sorting. The objective of this research project was to develop one method for the automatic clearing and for the separation of components after the sheet metal cutting process. The NC data of the <b>flame</b> <b>cutting</b> plan on the one hand and the specific requirements of each company on the other, will serve as a basis for this method. For the development of such a method, the State of the art of the process, as well as the available tools was first analyzed. Based on these three concepts for the automatic sorting sheet were developed and examined. A concept, at which small components, less than 17 kg, shall be handled manually, middle size parts with a new flexible magnet-traverse and finally large parts with available big traverses, has prevailed against the other concepts. The traverse, developed in this project, is characterized by the fact that their magnets are individually switchable and additional individually adjustable using linear axes. The identification and localization of the parts are performed through evaluation of cutting and marking data with a software tool developed in the research project. This software controls the complete process of clearing and separating parts and wastes.

The proposed system {{consists of two}} subsystems, namely a process monitoring and a control and optimization module. The process monitoring module evaluates the cut quality by measuring a set of sensing parameters, which are well-correlated with different quality characteristics of the cut surface. The applicability of different optical sensors (photodiodes and a NIRcamera) has been investigated. An overview of the most suitable set of sensing parameters is presented. The correlations between different quality deteriorations and the sensing parameters are mentioned {{as well as the}} reasons for these correlations. The real-time control and optimization module is implemented as an expert system with a dual functionality. On the one hand, it compares the sensing parameters with predefined thresholds and assigns one of the predefined quality classes to the instantaneous cut quality. On the other hand, it modifies the cutting parameters based on the predefined set of interpretable rules corresponding to the identified quality class.
