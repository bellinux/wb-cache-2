For pearl, for example, it describes using Jamvera fruit juice (contains lime) mixed with boiled rice starch in order to clean and soften pearls, then pierced to make holes for jewelry. A sequential Vitanapatti method of cleaning, states the text, wherein the pearls are cleaned with hot water, wine and milk gives the best results. A pearl, asserts the text, should be examined by friction test which it describes. Similar procedures and tests are described for emerald, jade, diamonds and all 14 gems the text includes.|$|R

The United States Geological Survey and many <b>gem</b> <b>experts</b> have stated that Yogos are [...] "among the world's finest sapphires."

The gems discussed include Ruby, Pearl, Yellow Sapphire, Hessonite, Emerald, Diamond, Cats eye, Blue Sapphire, Coral, Red Garnet, Jade, colorless Quartz, and Bloodstone. The technical discussion of gems in the text is woven with its theories on the mythical creation of each gem, astrological significance and talisman benefits.|$|E

50|$|Miscovich {{wanted to}} prove the {{authenticity}} of the find and gauge them on their worth. Josh Lents, a <b>gem</b> <b>expert</b> of the Geomological Appraisal Laboratory was shocked when Miscovich showed him the uncut emeralds in his New York office. Lents ran spectroscopic tests on the emeralds and determined that they were from Colombia, but was unable to determine their worth. Sotheby's of New York estimated some of the larger emeralds were worth $45,000, while others were appraised to be worth anywhere between $25,000 and $80,000. Almost all of the experts agreed that they would be worth more if it could be proven that they were from a famous shipwreck. As word of the treasure spread, it attracted much attention in the media and the marine salvage industry. In April 2012 television program 60 Minutes covered a story based around the find, further increasing the notoriety of the wreck.|$|E

[...] As there are museums dedicated to science, war and industry, this would be one devoted to the study and exhibition of the peaceful arts. “…Mr. Julius Rosenwald’s industrial museum gift paralleled the $2,500,000.00 bequest of the late Henry R.

Kunz, mineralogist and <b>gem</b> <b>expert,</b> an honorary fellow of the American Museum of Natural History, who has visited every world’s fair since the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876. Announcement of the Towne bequest sent experts in agriculture, animal industry, mining and metallurgy, transportation, engineering, aeronautics, etc., etc., flocking to Europe to study exhibits in such places as the German Museum in Munich, which contains replicas or originals of epochal contrivances, including James Watt’s first steam engine, Diesel’s oil-compression engine, Dunlop’s original tires.

40|$|The {{original}} Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) model {{predicted that}} established business {{activity at the}} national level varies with General National Framework Conditions (NFCs), while entrepreneurial activity varies with Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions (EFCs) (Reynolds et al., 2005). Yet the EFCs as currently specified have neutral or negative bivariate correlations with TEA {{at the national level}} (Autio, 2007). We tested the propo-sition that the EFCs, as currently measured, actually represent “high growth entrepreneurial framework condi-tions”, rather than framework conditions for general entrepreneurial activity. We used <b>GEM</b> <b>expert</b> survey data from 2000 to 2006 in a panel comprising all GEM countries to test this proposition. Controlling for per-capita GDP, GDP growth, population growth, and industry structure, we found that the prevalence and relative preva-lence of high-expectation entrepreneurial activity varied significantly and directly with national levels of entre-preneurship education and training, and that the relative prevalence of high-expectation entrepreneurial activity also varied inversely with the extent of government regulations on new firm entry. These findings are consistent with received economic theorising on how national context affects entrepreneurial activity...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between senior entrepreneurship propensity (entrepreneurship of the elderly) and national entrepreneurial context, in the European countries that exhibit either high or low levels of senior entrepreneurship. We focus on European countries that participated in Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) in 2013. We use GEM data as the main data source for our analysis. Firstly, we analyse the propensity of senior entrepreneurship on the national level, {{in order to create}} two clusters (high and low ones) based on the senior entrepreneurial activity. These clusters are then studied separately, compared and analysed based on their entrepreneurial environment. In order to assess the state of the national entrepreneurial environment, we use the GEM evaluation of key Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions, which are evaluated by <b>GEM</b> National <b>Expert</b> Survey. We thereafter compare the quality and profile of entrepreneurial environment based on the framework conditions in each of the created clusters and study similarities and differences both within the clusters and between them. In the further analysis, we investigate which of the entrepreneurial conditions and to what extent might play the role in influencing the senior entrepreneurial activity propensity in both high-activity and low-activity clusters...|$|R
