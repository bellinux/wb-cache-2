5|$|<b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{possible}} to embolize vascular lesions through interventional radiology; this requires passing a catheter {{through a large}} artery and locating the maxillary artery under X-ray guidance, followed by the injection into the vessel of particles that occlude the blood vessels. The benefit from the procedure tends to be short-lived, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> most appropriate in episodes of severe bleeding.|$|E

50|$|The {{location}} of the original abbey church from the 8th century <b>is</b> controversial. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> {{at the site of}} today's clergy house, where remains of a small church have <b>been</b> discovered. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> where the 12th-century church stands today.

5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{has also}} been reported in association with some forms of neck manipulation. There is significant controversy {{about the level of}} risk of stroke from neck manipulation. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> that manipulation can cause dissection, or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> that the dissection is already present in some people who seek manipulative treatment. At this time, conclusive evidence does not exist to support either a strong association between neck manipulation and stroke, or no association.|$|E
5|$|When an {{ambulance}} is retired, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> donated or sold to another EMS provider. Alternately, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> adapted into a {{storage and transport}} vehicle for crime scene identification equipment, a command post at community events, or support vehicle, such as a logistics unit.

60|$|I did {{not wish}} to appear superstitious, or to put down to {{extraordinary}} causes that which may have a natural explanation.

5|$|A genetic {{study in}} 2012 found clear {{differences}} between various {{populations of the}} Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Pantanal; Madeira River basin; Rio Negro basin) and these are apparently isolated from each others, leading to the suggestion that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a cryptic species complex.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> that the marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people. Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> that Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.|$|E
5|$|A {{preparation}} of L-ornithine and L-aspartate (LOLA) {{is used to}} increase the generation of urea through the urea cycle, a metabolic pathway that removes ammonia by turning it into the neutral substance urea. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> combined with lactulose and/or rifaximin if these alone are ineffective at controlling symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Katinka's shrew (Crocidura katinka) is {{a species}} of mammal in the family Soricidae. It has been {{recorded}} from Israel, Syria, and Palestine, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> now <b>be</b> extinct in Israel. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> present in southwestern Iran.|$|R

5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} of the day between noon and evening. It {{is the time}} when the sun is {{descending}} from its zenith in the sky to somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west direction. In human life, it occupies roughly {{the latter half of the}} standard work and school day. It is also associated with a number of concerns related to health, safety, and economic productivity: generally, the early afternoon, after most people have eaten lunch, corresponds to decreased work performance, decreased alertness, and a higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents. It is usually from 12 PM to 6 PM, but during winter <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> from 12 PM to 4 PM and during summer <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> from 12 PM to 8 PM.|$|E
5|$|Although shoe polish is {{primarily}} intended for leather shoes, some brands specify {{that they may}} be used on non-porous materials, such as vinyl.

50|$|There is also {{a longer}} version of the Theology, the authorship of which is uncertain. According to Shlomo Pines, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> written by Isma'ilis. Paul Fenton, on the other hand, thought <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> derived from Egyptian Jews.|$|R

5|$|Apart from {{attempts}} to control {{the spread of the}} Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications. Discovery {{of the structure of the}} viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> possible to develop specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins. Finally, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> possible to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for viral replication.|$|E
5|$|Asexuality is {{the lack}} of sexual {{attraction}} to others, or low or absent interest in or desire for sexual activity. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> considered the lack of a sexual orientation, or one of the variations thereof, alongside heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality.|$|E
5|$|B.s. 'Coastal Candles', {{propagated}} by Merv Hodge, {{came from}} Philip Vaughan's 'Schnapper Point' plant. Some plants are behaving differently, so <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{that not all}} material {{is exactly the same}} clone.|$|E
