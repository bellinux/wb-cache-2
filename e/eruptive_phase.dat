5|$|In {{explosive}} eruptions, {{the eruption}} of magma {{is driven by the}} rapid release of pressure, often involving the explosion of gas previously dissolved within the material. The most famous and destructive historical eruptions are mainly of this type. An <b>eruptive</b> <b>phase</b> can consist of a single eruption, or a sequence of several eruptions spread over several days, weeks or months. Explosive eruptions usually involve thick, highly viscous, silicic or felsic magma, high in volatiles like water vapor and carbon dioxide. Pyroclastic materials are the primary product, typically in the form of tuff. Eruptions the size of that at Lake Toba 74,000 years ago, at least , or the Yellowstone eruption 620,000 years ago, around , occur worldwide every 50,000 to 100,000years.|$|E
25|$|The {{final phase}} of eruptive {{activity}} was effusive in nature with no explosive activity (VEI-0). This effusive volcanism produced lava flows with well-preserved lava channels on the northwest and southwest flanks of Hoodoo Mountain in the early Holocene epoch and are largely unglaciated, suggesting the final <b>eruptive</b> <b>phase</b> occurred in an ice-free environment. These lava flows originated from the mountain's flat-topped summit and volcanic vents on its flanks. Geologists do not always agree on the dates of these more recent eruptions, some dating them to nine thousand years ago, others to as recently as seven thousand years ago.|$|E
500|$|The Mount Cayley massif, [...] in elevation, is {{the largest}} and most {{persistent}} volcano in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. It is a highly eroded stratovolcano composed of dacite and rhyodacite lava that was deposited during three phases of volcanic activity. The first <b>eruptive</b> <b>phase</b> started about four million years ago with the eruption of dacite lava flows and pyroclastic rock. This resulted {{in the creation of the}} Mount Cayley proper. Subsequent volcanism during this volcanic phase constructed a significant lava dome. This acts like a volcanic plug and composes the lava spines that currently form pinnacles on Cayley's rugged summit. After the Mount Cayley proper was constructed, lava flows, tephra and welded dacite rubble was erupted. This second phase of activity [...] million years ago resulted in the creation of the Vulcan's Thumb, a craggy volcanic ridge on the southern flank of the Mount Cayley proper. Lengthy dissection from an extended period of erosion demolished much of the original stratovolcano. Volcanic activity after this prolonged period of erosion produced thick dacite lava flows from parasitic vents 300,000years ago that extended into the Turbid and Shovelnose Creek valleys near the Squamish River. This subsequently created two minor parasitic lava domes 200,000years ago. These three volcanic events in contrast to several others around Cayley in that they do not show signs of interaction with glacial ice.|$|E

50|$|Wolf Island is the southerly island on the lineament. The volcano {{that formed}} Wolf Island is now extinct with last eruptions {{believed}} to have been 900,000 - 1,600,000 years ago, meaning the last eruptions occurred before the last eruptions on Darwin Island. The volcanic history of Wolf is complex, with at least two major <b>eruptive</b> <b>phases.</b> The southern area of the island is formed from flat basalt layers from two <b>eruptive</b> <b>phases,</b> the second of which formed a caldera that has now eroded. The lavas formed have been plagioclase ultraphyric basalts with large 4 cm crystals. This chemical makeup is similar to those found in lavas from the northern Galápagos Islands. The extent of the ultraphyric flows make up an unusually large percentage of the volume. There is large variation in the composition of the lavas between <b>eruptive</b> <b>phases,</b> with later flows being depleted.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the second}} <b>eruptive</b> <b>phase</b> 80,000years ago, eruptions {{were no longer}} subglacial, but the volcano was {{surrounded}} by ice at least [...] thick. Lava flows during this <b>eruptive</b> <b>phase</b> melted some of the thick glacial ice and ponded around the perimeters of Hoodoo Mountain, which quickly solidified to form a barrier behind which more lava piled up. Such ice-marginal lava flows are anomalously thick and are normally bounded by steep cliffs with fine-scale cooling joints and lots of volcanic glass. These ice-marginal lava flows form the massive lava cliffs near the base of Hoodoo Mountain and are among Hoodoo's most prominent features.|$|E
2500|$|The third <b>eruptive</b> <b>phase</b> between 80and 54thousand {{years ago}} was {{followed}} by explosive activity that produced pyroclastic flows down the northern and western flanks of the mountain to create welded and unwelded ignimbrite deposits up to [...] thick.

This eruption was accompanied by a [...] high ash plume which spread over an area of , depositing ash and tephra to the southwest of the volcano.

40|$|We present {{continuous}} SO 2 measurements {{performed at}} Tungurahua volcano {{with a permanent}} network of 4 scanning DOAS instruments between 2007 and 2013. The volcano has been erupting since September 1999, but on the contrary to {{the first years of}} eruption when the activity was quasi-continuous, the activity transitioned in late 2008 towards the occurrence of distinct <b>eruptive</b> <b>phases</b> separated by periods of quiescence. During our study period we distinguish 11 phases lasting from 17 to 527 days separated by quiescence periods of 26 to 184 days. We propose a new routine to quantify the SO 2 emissions when data from a dense DOAS monitoring network are available. This routine consists in summing all the highest validated SO 2 measurements among all stations during the 10 h of daily working-time to obtain a daily observed SO 2 mass. Since measurement time is constant at Tungurahua the "observed" amounts can be expressed in tons per 10 h and can easily be converted to a daily average flux or mass per day. Our results provide time series having an improved correlation on a long time scale with the <b>eruptive</b> <b>phases</b> and with quiescence periods. A total of 1. 25 Mt (1. 25 × 109 kg) of SO 2 has been released by Tungurahua during the study period, with 95 % of these emissions occurring during phases of activity and only 5 % during quiescence. This shows a contrast with previous volcanic behaviour when passive degassing dominated the total SO 2 emissions. SO 2 average daily mass emission rates are of 73 ± 56 t/d during quiescent periods, 735 ± 969 t/d during long-lasting phases and 1424 ± 1224 t/d during short-lasting phases. Degassing during the different <b>eruptive</b> <b>phases</b> displays variable patterns. However, two contrasting behaviours can be distinguished for the onset of <b>eruptive</b> <b>phases</b> with both sudden and progressive onsets being observed. The first is characterised by violent opening of the conduit by high energy Vulcanian explosions; and the second by a progressive, in crescendo, development of the activity. The first case is becoming more frequent at Tungurahua making the volcano more dangerous and less predictable...|$|R

2500|$|The Black Tusk, a black {{pinnacle}} of volcanic rock on the northwestern shore of Garibaldi Lake, is the glacially eroded remnant {{of a much}} larger volcano that formed during two periods of volcanic activity. The first between 1.1and 1.3million years ago erupted hornblende andesite lava flows and tuffs. These volcanics compose mountain ridges southwest, southeast and northwest of the prime volcanic structure. Subsequent erosion demolished the newly formed volcano. This ultimately exposed the roots of the cone, which currently form the rugged edifice of The Black Tusk. After the cone was eroded, a series of hypersthene andesite lava flows were erupted between 0.17and 0.21million years ago. These end at adjacent ice-marginal lava flows that form [...] cliffs. This <b>eruptive</b> <b>phase</b> also produced a lava dome that comprises the current [...] high pinnacle. Consequently, the regional Late Pleistocene ice sheet carved a deep north-trending U-shaped valley into the eastern flank of the second-stage cone. Here, subsequent lava flows from Cinder Cone filled the valley.|$|E
2500|$|Patients {{can develop}} two {{clinical}} phases: an acute septic phase and a chronic <b>eruptive</b> <b>phase</b> associated with skin lesions. In the acute phase (also known as Oroya fever or fiebre de la Oroya), B. bacilliformis infection is a sudden, potentially life-threatening infection {{associated with high}} fever and decreased levels of circulating red blood cells (i.e., hemolytic anemia)and transient immunosuppression. B. bacilliformis is considered the most deadly species to date, with a death rate of up to 90% during the acute phase, which typically lasts two to four weeks. Peripheral blood smears show anisomacrocytosis with many bacilli adherent to red blood cells. Thrombocytopenia is also seen and can be very severe. Neurologic manifestations (neurobartonellosis) are altered mental status, agitation, or even coma, ataxia, spinal meningitis, or paralysis. It is seen in 20% of patients with acute infection, in which the prognosis is very guarded with an about 50% mortality.

40|$|The initial eruptive {{episodes of}} {{explosive}} eruptions {{are classified as}} phreatic if the amount of juvenile material (scoria, glass, pumice) is null, {{and the amount of}} fresh accidental lithics, and hydrothermally altered lithics, is substantial. Phreatic eruptions have been in some cases recognized as precursory events preceding phreatomagmatic and magmatic <b>eruptive</b> <b>phases.</b> Usually, the lithological features of tephra deposits are investigated and sampled in the field. Investigation of ash samples under binocular microscope or by Back-Scattered Electron (BSE) microscope images of polished sections is usually considered sufficient to typify the fragmentation mechanism of the eruption. The opening <b>eruptive</b> <b>phases</b> at Turrialba volcano, together with the formation of new intracraters (i. e. 2010, 2012, 2014) and the enlargement of the Western Crater (29 October 2014 to present), were classified, in previous papers and internal reports as phreatic. We studied a series of ash samples erupted from 2010 to 2016, with the aim of understanding the fragmentation processes characterizing the vent opening phases. We used SEM + EDS analyses, in addition to field and microscopic investigation. Results showed a composition of accidental lithics of fresh to hydrothermally altered clasts and secondary minerals (82 – 98 %), besides juvenile andesite fragments (2 – 18 %), which leads us to revisit the classification of the initial <b>eruptive</b> <b>phases</b> of Turrialba as phreatomagmatic. Our method allowed the detection of a juvenile component directly involved in an effective magma-water interaction, which was possible only by a scrutinous examination of the glass surface textures by SEM in the range size between 3 and 3. 5 phi.

40|$|New volcanological studies allow {{reconstruction}} of the eruption dynamics of the Pomici di Mercato eruption (ca 8, 900 cal. yr B. P.) of Somma-Vesuvius. Three main <b>Eruptive</b> <b>Phases</b> are distinguished based on two distinct erosion surfaces that interrupt stratigraphic continuity of the deposits, indicating that time breaks occurred during the eruption. Absence of reworked volcaniclastic deposits {{on top of the}} erosion surfaces suggests that quiescent periods between <b>eruptive</b> <b>phases</b> were short perhaps lasting only days to weeks. Each of the <b>Eruptive</b> <b>Phases</b> was characterised by deposition of alternating fall and pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits. The fallout deposits blanketed a wide area toward the east, while the more restricted PDC deposits inundated the volcano slopes. Eruptive dynamics were driven by brittle magmatic fragmentation of a phonolitic magma, which, because of its mechanical fragility, produced a significant amount of fine ash. External water did not significantly contribute either to fragmentation dynamics or to mechanical energy release during the eruption. Column heights were between 18 and 22 km, corresponding to mass discharge rates between 1. 4 and 6 x 10 (7) kg s(- 1). The estimated on land volume of fall deposits ranges from a minimum of 2. 3 km(3) to a maximum of 7. 4 km(3). Calculation of physical parameters of the dilute pyroclastic density currents indicates speeds of a few tens of m s(- 1) and densities of a few kg m(- 3) (average of the lowermost 10 m of the currents), resulting in dynamic pressures lower than 3 kPa. These data suggest that the potential impact of pyroclastic density currents of the Pomici di Mercato eruption was smaller than those of other Plinian and sub-Plinian eruptions of Somma-Vesuvius, especially those of 1631 AD and 472 AD (4 - 14 kPa), which represent reference values for the Vesuvian emergency plan. The pulsating and long-lasting behaviour of the Pomici di Mercato eruption is unique in the history of large explosive eruptions of Somma-Vesuvius. We suggest an eruptive scheme in which discrete magma batches rose from the magma chamber through a network of fractures. The injection and rise of the different magma batches was controlled by the interplay between magma chamber overpressure and local stress. The intermittent discharge of magma during a large explosive eruption is unusual for Somma-Vesuvius, as well as for other volcanoes worldwide, and yields new insights for improving our knowledge of the dynamics of explosive eruptions...|$|R

Comparatively, results based on a single data set describing the entire eruption sequence suggest a total mass of 1. 69 × 10 ¹² kg. Values for total erupted mass determined by inversion were compared to those calculated using various curve fitting approaches. An exponential (two-segment) method, taking into account missing distal data, was found to be most compatible with inversion results, giving an erupted mass of 2. 52 × 10 ¹² kg when combining individual phases and 1. 59 × 10 ¹² kg when utilising a single data set describing the Hoei sequence. Similarly, a Weibull fitting method determined a total erupted mass of 1. 54 × 10 ¹² kg for the single data set and compared favourably with inversion results when enough data were available.

40|$|The Lyttelton Volcanic Complex, {{north-western}} Banks Peninsula, New Zealand, {{is comprised}} of five overlapping volcanic cones. Two magma systems are postulated to have fed Banks Peninsula’s basaltic intraplate volcanism, with simultaneous volcanism occurring in both the north-western and south-eastern regions of Banks Peninsula, to form Lyttelton and Akaroa Volcanic Complexes respectively. The elongate form of Banks Peninsula is postulated {{to relate to the}} upward constraining of magmatism in a north-west / south-east fault bounded zone. The Lyttelton Volcanic Complex resulted from the development of a pull-apart basin, with a number of releasing bend faults, controlling the location of eruptive sites. Cone structure further influenced the pathway magma propagated, with new eruptive sites developing on the un-buttressed flanks, resulting in the eruption and formation of a new cone, or as further cone growth recorded as an eruptive package. Each cone formed through constructional or <b>eruptive</b> <b>phases,</b> termed an <b>eruptive</b> package. Eruptive packages commonly terminate with a rubbly a’a to blocky lava flow, identified through stratigraphic relationships, lava flow trends and flow types, a related dyking regime, and radial erosional features (i. e. ridges and valleys). Within the overall evolving geochemical trend of the Lyttelton Volcanic Complex, are cyclic <b>eruptive</b> <b>phases,</b> intrinsically linked to eruptive packages. Within an eruptive package, crystal content fluctuates, but there is a common trend of increasing feldspar content, with peak levels corresponding to a blocky lava flow horizon, indicating the role of increased crystalinity and lava flow rheology. Cyclic <b>eruptive</b> <b>phases</b> relate to discreet magma batches within the higher levels of the edifice, with crystal content increasing as each magma batch evolves, limiting the ability of the volcanic system, over time, to erupt. Evolving magmas resulted in explosive eruptions following effusive eruptives, and / or result in the intrusion of hypabyssal features such as dykes and domes, of more evolved compositions (i. e. trachyte). Each eruptive package hosts a radial dyke swarm, reflecting the stress state of a shallow level magma chamber or a newly developed stress field due to gravitational relaxation in the newly constructed edifice, at the time of emplacement. Two distinct erosional structures are modelled; radial valleys and cone-controlled valleys. Radial valleys reflect radial erosion about a cone’s summit, while cone-controlled valleys are regions where eruptive packages and cones from different centres meet, allowing stream development. Interbedded epiclastic deposits within the Lyttelton lava flow sequences indicate volcanic degradation during volcanic activity. As degradation of the volcanic complex progressed, summit regions coalesced, later becoming unidirectional breached, increasing the area of the drainage basin and thus the potential to erode and transport extensive amounts of material away, ultimately forming Lyttelton Harbour, Gebbies Pass, and the infilled Mt Herbert region. Epiclastic deposits on the south-eastern side of Lyttelton Harbour indicate a paleo-valley system (paleo-Lyttelton Harbour) existed prior to 8. 1 Ma, while the morphology of the Lyttelton Volcanic Complex directed the eruptive sites, style and resultant morphology of the proceeding volcanic groups...|$|R
