5|$|Amrullah Saleh {{has been}} {{speaking}} and writing extensively {{on these issues}} in both local and international media. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> that the Taliban need to disarm and honor {{the integrity of the}} Afghan constitution before they could be considered for any reconciliation process.|$|E
5|$|Burke also {{criticizes the}} {{learning}} {{associated with the}} French philosophes; <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> that new ideas should not, in an imitation of the emerging discipline of science, be tested on society {{in an effort to}} improve it, but that populations should rely on custom and tradition to guide them.|$|E
5|$|Barrowman {{graduated}} from high school in 1985, and became a naturalised citizen of the United States (although <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> dual citizenship of both the United Kingdom and the US). After he {{graduated from}} high school, he moved to San Diego, to study performing arts at the United States International University (USIU). As part of an exchange programme, he returned to his native Britain in 1989, to study Shakespeare for six months.|$|E

5|$|Butler, today {{known as}} Muhammad Abdul Aziz, was paroled in 1985 {{and became the}} head of the Nation's Harlem mosque in 1998; <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> his innocence. In prison Johnson, who changed his name to Khalil Islam, {{rejected}} the Nation's teachings and converted to Sunni Islam. Released in 1987, he maintained his innocence until his death in August 2009. Hayer, today known as Mujahid Halim, was paroled in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs {{was born}} into a {{football}} family. His father Dennis had played for Hitchin Town, Hemel Hempstead Town and St Albans City, while father-in-law Alan helped form the youth team Nascot Wood Rangers. Although a Watford supporter from childhood, Gibbs is related to supporters of both Watford and Luton Town, despite the rivalry between the two. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> a connection with his former club, regularly attending club events and occasionally playing for their masters football team.|$|E
5|$|Víctor Valdés played 535 {{official}} {{games of}} which <b>he</b> <b>maintained</b> a clean sheet in 237 games, or 44.3% of the matches. The former record {{was held by}} Andoni Zubizarreta who played 410 official games of which <b>he</b> <b>maintained</b> a clean sheet in 173 games, or 42.2% of the matches.|$|R

5|$|Harpole {{was first}} elected to the Amarillo City Council as the Councilmember for Place 2, one of four City Council {{positions}} elected at-large {{by a majority of}} voters, in May 2005. He served a single two-year term. During his term, in 2006, the city's Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone for downtown Amarillo was created. When it was created, Harpole became the TIRZ board's vice-chairman, a role <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> today.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic. He returns {{to the idea that}} {{theology}} and mystical philosophies (he gives the examples of Vedanta, Spinoza, Hegel, and Bradley) will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine of the Mystery of God, <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> this is because the intellect is inherently incapable of understanding the Ultimate. All attempts to state the nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.|$|E
5|$|Lucas is {{an admirer}} of English poet and painter William Blake; Elizabeta reveals that Lucas' admiration of Blake is based on their common {{distrust}} of systems. Lucas decorates his flat with some of Blake's paintings, and has a chest tattoo resembling The Ancient of Days, one of Blake's watercolour paintings. Though no longer married to Elizabeta, <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> strong feelings towards her throughout {{the first half of}} series seven.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, <b>he</b> <b>maintained</b> {{a farm in}} Sailes.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>maintained</b> residences in Manhattan and Tuxedo Park, New York.|$|R
50|$|He {{retired from}} {{competitive}} bodybuilding after that {{show at the}} age of 29. <b>He</b> <b>maintained</b> that the contest was rigged until the day he died. While he never said he thought that he should have won, <b>he</b> <b>maintained</b> that Arnold should not have, though he eventually got on good terms with Schwarzenegger.|$|R
5|$|Next Stace {{explains}} {{that there are}} two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here he says that he agrees with Kant, who made a distinction between the world of phenomena and the noumenon, although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.|$|E
5|$|A male {{sea otter}} {{is most likely}} to mate if <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> a {{breeding}} territory in an area that is also favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, males typically defend their territory only from spring to autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males, although actual fighting is rare. Adult females move freely between male territories, where they outnumber adult males by an average of five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> that these representations {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Willis and then-wife Demi Moore {{campaigned for}} Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis's Presidential bid. Four years later, he {{supported}} President George H. W. Bush for reelection {{and was an}} outspoken critic of Bill Clinton. However, in 1996, he declined to endorse Clinton's Republican opponent Bob Dole, because Dole had criticized Demi Moore for her role in the film Striptease. Willis was an invited speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention, and supported George W. Bush that year. He did not make any contributions or public endorsements in the 2008 presidential campaign. In several June 2007 interviews, he declared that <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> some Republican ideologies.|$|E
5|$|The {{first chapter}} asks what {{religion}} is, stating that religious thought is contradictory, {{is rooted in}} intuition, and that God is fundamentally a mystery. The second and third chapters look at the negative divine - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, {{it is only the}} theories about it that differ. On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continue}} their struggling {{investigation into the}} murder of 11-year-old Adena Watson. Bayliss wants to question an arabber who <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> is the killer, but Pembleton believes that lead has already been exhausted. Pembleton instead pursues a theory posed by Felton (Daniel Baldwin) that Watson was killed one day earlier than they first believed, and rigor mortis was slowed because her body was stored in a cool place. Felton and Pembleton identify a possible suspect who lived near the murder scene, and learn his car was impounded shortly after her body was found. As they search impound lots for the car, the two detectives bicker {{with each other and}} Pembleton accuses Felton of racism. They eventually find the car, but uncover no evidence linking it to Watson.|$|E

5|$|Gilchrist's attacking batting {{has been}} {{a key part of}} Australia's one-day success, as he usually opened the batting. He {{was a part of the}} {{successful}} 1999, 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cup campaigns. Gilchrist's Test batting average in the upper 40s is unusually high for a wicket-keeper. He is currently 45th on the all–time list of highest batting averages. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> a Test strike-rate of 82 runs per hundred balls, the highest since balls were recorded in full. His combination of attack and consistency create one of the most dynamic world cricketers ever, playing shots to all areas of the field with uncommon timing. He is second on the all-time list of most sixes in Tests at 100 with only Brendon McCullum ahead of him with 107. Gilchrist's skills as a wicket-keeper are sometimes questioned; some people claim that he is the best keeper in Australia whilst others claim that Victorian wicket-keeper Darren Berry is the best Australian wicket-keeper of the 1990s and early 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Mr Albert is Galaxity's contact on 20th century Earth. He {{makes his}} first {{appearance}} in Métro Châtelet, Direction Cassiopeia. He is a retired gentleman who drives an obsolete Renault 4CV and lives {{in the suburbs of}} Paris, France. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> a wide range of contacts in government and scientific circles as well as with many experts in fields outside the mainstream such as ufology, telepathy, and sorcery. He is also a pigeon fancier and uses his carrier pigeons to relay messages between some of his contacts. Unlike Valérian he tries to avoid getting involved {{in the thick of the}} action and never acts impulsively, always preferring to take his time about things. He enjoys the finer things in life: gourmet cuisine, fine wines and likes to take things easy.|$|E
5|$|A {{hallmark}} of director Sir Ridley Scott {{is the theme}} of artificial intelligence present in his science fiction films. Scott's earliest foray into the philosophy of artificial intelligence was with the android character Ash, in the original Alien film released in 1979. Ian Holm portrayed Ash as a character who may uncannily assume a human form, yet <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> a sense of superiority that is only humbled {{by the nature of the}} Alien, which runs counter to the very future of the human race. In the book The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott, the authors- Adam Barkman, Ashley Barkman and Nancy Kang- reason that though Ash is designed to appear human, his innards are bio-mechanical and he himself does not presume to be a sentient being with a semblance of life, but an artificial construct whose personality is dictated by machinery. Every subsequent installment in the Alien film series directed by Scott features at least one synthetic (android) character designated to maintain order aboard their respective space ship. In 2017, Scott explained that the synthetics featured in the Alien films he directed are designed to subvert their robotic nature and to impeccably mimic humans. The original form of androids introduced in Alien would contradict the observable nature of David in Prometheus; though both would serve the same corporate masters and have the same non-human innards, David would identify himself as a sentient entity who is capable of expressing - if not feeling - emotion.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003 he {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>maintained</b> a [...] "spiritual relationship" [...] with the Brazilian actress and dancer Mariette Detotto, with whom he shared a TV program. <b>He</b> always <b>maintained</b> his residence in Puerto Rico.|$|R
