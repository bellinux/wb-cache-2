5|$|A small {{minority}} of the population practise ancient Pagan religions. Neopaganism in the United Kingdom is primarily represented by Wicca and Witchcraft religions, Druidry, and Heathenry. According to the 2011 UK Census, there are roughly 53,172 people who identify as Pagan in England, and 3,448 <b>in</b> <b>Wales,</b> including 11,026 Wiccans in England and 740 <b>in</b> <b>Wales.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{although}} new {{courts have}} been opened in various locations, {{there has been}} a {{reduction in the number of}} locations where a county court is held. In all, 80 towns and cities <b>in</b> <b>Wales</b> have held county courts since 1847; 60 have closed and, as of 2012, 20 county courts <b>in</b> <b>Wales</b> are still open. The most recent opening of a county court took place in Caerphilly in 1965, although this closed in 2000. The first county court to close was Fishguard, in 1856. The latest county courts to close <b>in</b> <b>Wales</b> were Aberdare and Pontypool in 2011. Newbridge was the location of a county court for the shortest period– for only five months in 1856. Blaenavon is the only town <b>in</b> <b>Wales</b> to have a county court close and then reopen, both events taking place in 1938.|$|E

5|$|The largest {{religion}} <b>in</b> <b>Wales</b> is Christianity, with 57.6% of {{the population}} describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census.

The first Independent Church <b>in</b> <b>Wales</b> was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth. The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811.|$|E
5|$|Women's {{suffrage}} <b>in</b> <b>Wales</b> {{has historically}} been marginalised due to the prominence of societies and political groups in England which led the reform for women throughout the United Kingdom.

Nevertheless, distinct Welsh groups and individuals rose to prominence and were vocal in the rise of suffrage <b>in</b> <b>Wales</b> and the rest of Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|A high {{proportion}} of the Welsh population lives in smaller settlements: nearly 20% live in villages of less than 1,500 persons compared with 10% in England.

5|$|According to the thirteenth-century Historia Gruffud vab Kenan, {{the mother}} of Cynan's son was Ragnailt ingen Amlaíb, a {{paternal}} granddaughter of Sitriuc. Further revealed by this source {{is the fact that}} this woman's father, Amlaíb mac Sitriuc, built and commanded a Welsh fortress called Castell Avloed. Although it is unknown how long the Dubliners possessed the fortress, in 1036 another son of Sitriuc was slain <b>in</b> <b>Wales</b> by an apparent kinsman, an event which could be evidence of a struggle for control of the site. Echmarcach's aforesaid expulsion of Sitriuc from Dublin in the same year could in turn indicate that this exiled monarch sought refuge <b>in</b> <b>Wales.</b>|$|E

In 1912 the anti-suffrage WNASL was amalgamated into the newly formed National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage (NLOWS), and that year a branch of the NLOWS was established in Bangor. Of the 286 branches of the organisation, 19 were eventually formed <b>in</b> <b>Wales.</b> Two of the most prolific supporters of the NLOWS <b>in</b> <b>Wales</b> were both Members of Parliament; Ivor Guest (Cardiff) and J.

5|$|Baldwin {{took the}} cross, or vowed {{to go on}} crusade, along with King Henry and many others in January 1188, or when he began his preaching {{campaign}} on 11 February 1188 to drum up support for the Third Crusade.

He spent most of the year <b>in</b> <b>Wales,</b> preaching the crusade, accompanied by the chronicler Gerald of Wales. Gerald claimed about 3000 recruits for the crusade from his and Baldwin's efforts <b>in</b> <b>Wales,</b> although he also suggested that Baldwin mainly embarked on the tour to avoid his dispute with the Canterbury monks.|$|E

40|$|Graduated {{compression}} stockings (GCS) {{have been}} widely used for the prophylaxis and treatment of venous diseases. Their gradient pressure function largely related to their fabric structure and material properties. By combing fabric physical testing and wear trials, this study investigated the GCSs fabric structure and material properties at different locations along the stocking hoses, and quantitatively analyzed the effects of fabrics on skin pressure longitudinal and transverse distributions. We concluded that, Structural characteristics and material properties of stocking fabrics were not uniform along the hoses, but a gradual variation from ankle to thigh regions, which significantly influenced the corresponding skin pressure gradient distributions; Tensile (WT, EM) and shearing properties (G) generated most significant differences among ankle, knee and thigh regions along the stocking hose, which significantly influenced the skin pressure lognitudinal gradient distribution. More material indices generating significant gradual changes occurred <b>in</b> the fabric <b>wale</b> direction along stocking hose, meaning that materials properties <b>in</b> <b>wale</b> direction would exert more important impact on the skin pressure gradient performances. And, the greater tensibility and smoother surface of fabric <b>in</b> <b>wale</b> direction would contribute to put stocking on and off, and facilitate wearers' leg extension-flexion movements. The indices of WT and EM of stocking fabrics in series A have strong linear correlations with skin pressure lognitudinal distribution, which largely related to their better performances in gradual changes of material properties. Skin pressure applied by fabric with same material properties produced pronounced differences among four different directions around certain cross-sections of human leg, especially at the ankle region; and, the skin pressure magnitudes at ankle region were more easily influenced by the materials properties, which were considered to be largely related to the anatomic structure of human leg.
