It {{was created in}} response to the abuse and death of eight-year-old Victoria Climbié in 2000 in England. Various agencies involved in her care had failed to prevent her death. ContactPoint aimed to improve child protection by improving the way information about children was shared between services. It was designed by Capgemini and previously had the working titles of <b>Information</b> <b>Sharing</b> Index (or IS Index or ISI) and the Children's Index.|$|E

5|$|It {{introduced}} {{training for}} {{police officers and}} anti-human-trafficking service providers in communities that are particularly susceptible to human trafficking. The plan also includes an increase in training for prosecutors, border guards, and judges. The plan launched a nationally integrated law enforcement team tasked specifically with combatting human trafficking, {{the first of its}} kind in Canada. The team combines the forces of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), CBSA, and local police. Due to difficulties encountered by Canadian law enforcement when investigating human trafficking before the establishment of the NAP-CHT, this model of law enforcement integration, emulating successful teams combatting human trafficking in the United States, was included. This law enforcement integration model is intended to optimize <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> and facilitate proactive investigation. The NAP-CHT allocates substantial funds to the RCMP Human Trafficking National Coordination Centre (HTNCC), which is based in Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|The British {{bargaining}} position had worsened; the American scientists {{had decided that}} the United States no longer needed outside help, {{and they wanted to}} prevent Britain exploiting post-war commercial applications of atomic energy. The committee supported, and Roosevelt agreed to, restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war—especially not bomb design—even if doing so slowed down the American project. By early 1943 the British stopped sending research and scientists to America, and as a result the Americans stopped all <b>information</b> <b>sharing.</b> The British considered ending the supply of Canadian uranium and heavy water to force the Americans to again share, but Canada needed American supplies to produce them. They investigated the possibility of an independent nuclear program, but determined that it could not be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> model {{assumes that}} {{individuals}} search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while the producer-scrounger model {{assumes that the}} search modes are mutually exclusive. Hopping with the head facing up and downward are observed to be statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the availability of seeds, the relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly. When the seed distribution made the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the head up diminished and appears to support the predictions of the producer-scrounger model.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} quantifying the <b>information</b> <b>shared</b> {{by a pair of}} random variables $X_{ 1 },X_{ 2 }$ about another variable $S$. We propose a new measure of <b>shared</b> <b>information,</b> called extractable <b>shared</b> <b>information,</b> that is left monotonic; that is, the <b>information</b> <b>shared</b> about $S$ is bounded from below by the <b>information</b> <b>shared</b> about $f(S) $ for any function $f$. We show that our measure leads to a new nonnegative decomposition of the mutual information $I(S;X_ 1 X_ 2) $ into shared, complementary and unique components. We study properties of this decomposition and show that a left monotonic <b>shared</b> <b>information</b> is not compatible with a Blackwell interpretation of unique information. We also discuss whether it is possible to have a decomposition in which both <b>shared</b> and unique <b>information</b> are left monotonic. Comment: 12 pages, journal versio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model to compare price {{discovery}} across sequential markets. Existing models are based on parallel markets where a common efficient price leads to a no-arbitrage relationship among multiple price series {{at any point in}} time. In our model, the changes in the efficient price are embedded in the sequential price changes across markets defined by time zones. We use a structural VAR to identify market-specific shocks to the efficient price and to measure a market’s contribution to price discovery. The model is applied to the 24 -hour trading of AUD, JPY, EUR, and GBP against USD over an eight-year sample period. We estimate the <b>information</b> <b>shares,</b> in the sense of Hasbrouck (1995), of four sequential markets around the world. Although Europe remains highly significant for the pricing of all four exchange rates, there is evidence of equalizing <b>information</b> <b>shares</b> between Asia and Europe, with Asia gaining <b>information</b> <b>shares</b> in EUR and GBP but losing <b>information</b> <b>shares</b> in AUD and JPY.

5|$|The FairTax is a {{national}} tax, but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency, which may have a bearing on compliance as the states' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The 0.25% retained by the states amounts to $5 billion the states would have available for enforcement and administration. For example, California should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration, {{which is more than}} the $327 million budget for the state's sales and excise taxes. Because the federal money paid to the states would be a percentage of the total revenue collected, John Linder claims the states would have an incentive to maximize collections. Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement, <b>information</b> <b>sharing,</b> and clear interstate revenue allocation rules. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that, on average, states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that state economies would benefit greatly from adopting a state-level FairTax.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow the}} {{introduction}} of the database, the government required all local authorities to implement the Integrated Children's System, a framework to help improve outcomes for children. The government set a deadline of 1 January 2007, and 92 out of the 150 local authorities failed to achieve this. The government began a consultation on the 2007 draft regulations on 21 September 2006 which ended on 14 December 2006. In October 2006, the government selected Capgemini to design the database. On 15 February 2007, the database was renamed from <b>Information</b> <b>Sharing</b> Index to ContactPoint, following research with stakeholder groups, including children and families, who decided that the name ContactPoint made clear what the purpose of the database was: to improve communication between those working with children. A consultation on a guide for database users was launched on 4 May 2007 and ended on 27 July 2007.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} and resolves the {{problems caused by}} microstructure effects when measuring {{the relative importance of}} home and U.

In order to avoid large bounds for <b>information</b> <b>shares,</b> previous studies applying the Cholesky decomposition within the Hasbrouck (1995) framework had to rely on high frequency data. However, this entails a potential bias of estimated <b>information</b> <b>shares</b> induced by microstructure effects. We propose a modified approach that relies on distributional assumptions and yields unique and unbiased <b>information</b> <b>shares.</b> Our results indicate that the role of the U.

Moreover, we find that rather than stock specific factors, market design determines <b>information</b> <b>shares.</b> [...] international cross-listings,market microstructure effects,price discovery...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} and drivers of credit risk discovery between stock and CDS {{markets in the}} US. Our research is distinguished from the existing literature in three aspects: 1) we employ an improved method to measure the information share; 2) we discover new drivers of credit risk discovery; and 3) we {{assess the impact of}} central clearing counterparty (CCP) on the CDS market. By using the generalized <b>information</b> <b>share</b> (GIS) by Lien and Shrestha (2014), we address the issue that the CDS and stock prices do not have one-to-one cointegration relation. The empirical results support the use of GIS instead of more conventional measures. We also find that eliminating transitory price components increases the <b>information</b> <b>share</b> of the CDS market in the earlier period of the sample. The economic condition and funding cost turn out to affect the <b>information</b> <b>share</b> of the CDS market negatively. Another interesting finding is that the CDS of investment grade firms possess higher <b>information</b> <b>shares</b> compared to speculative grade firms. Finally, CCP seems to reduce the <b>information</b> <b>share</b> of CDS, which suggests that the CDS market is driven largely by insider trading...|$|R
