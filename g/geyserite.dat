5|$|As a result, most geysers form {{in places}} where there is {{volcanic}} rhyolite rock which dissolves in hot water and forms mineral deposits called siliceous sinter, or <b>geyserite,</b> along {{the inside of the}} plumbing systems which are very slender. Over time, these deposits strengthen the channel walls by cementing the rock together tightly, thus enabling the geyser to persist, as mentioned in the previous section.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of geysers: {{fountain}} geysers which erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and cone geysers which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter (including <b>geyserite),</b> usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Old Faithful, perhaps the best-known geyser at Yellowstone National Park, {{is an example of a}} cone geyser. Grand Geyser, the tallest predictable geyser on earth, (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not predictable), also at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a fountain geyser.|$|E
40|$|To {{enhance our}} ability to extract palaeobiological and palaeoenvironmental {{information}} from ancient thermal spring deposits, we have studied the processes responsible for the development and preservation of stromatolites in modern subaerial thermal spring systems in Yellowstone National Park (USA). We investigated specimens collected from silica-depositing thermal springs along the thermal gradient using petrographic techniques and scanning electron microscopy. Although {{it is known that}} thermophilic cyanobacteria control the morphogenesis of thermal spring stromatolites below 73 degrees C, we have found that biofilms which contain filamentous thermophiles contribute to the microstructural development of subaerial <b>geyserites</b> that occur along the inner rims of thermal spring pools and geyser effluents. Biofilms intermittently colonize the surfaces of subaerial <b>geyserites</b> and provide a favoured substrate for opaline silica precipitation. We have also found that the preservation of biotically produced microfabrics of thermal spring sinters reflects dynamic balances between rates of population growth, decomposition of organic matter, silica deposition and early diagenesis. Major trends in preservation of thermophilic organisms along the thermal gradient are defined by differences in the mode of fossilization, including replacement, encrustation and permineralization...|$|R

Yet information about the depositional environment and possible diagenetic processes is available in atomic structure. This study probes the atomic structure of siliceous sinters from two geothermal areas using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic techniques.

25|$|Mars is of {{particular}} interest {{for the study of the}} origins of life because of its similarity to the early Earth. This is especially so since Mars has a cold climate and lacks plate tectonics or continental drift, so it has remained almost unchanged since the end of the Hesperian period. At least two thirds of Mars's surface is more than 3.5 billion years old, and Mars may thus hold the best record of the prebiotic conditions leading to abiogenesis, even if life does not or has never existed there. In May 2017, evidence of the earliest known life on land on Earth may have been found in 3.48-billion-year-old <b>geyserite</b> and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia.

500|$|A key {{requirement}} that enables a geyser to erupt is a material called <b>geyserite</b> found in rocks nearby the geyser. [...] Geyserite—mostly silicon dioxide (SiO2), is dissolved from {{the rocks and}} gets deposited {{on the walls of}} the geyser's plumbing system and on the surface. The deposits make the channels carrying the water up to the surface pressure-tight. This allows the pressure to be carried all the way to the top and not be leaked out into the loose gravel or soil that are normally under the geyser fields.|$|E
2500|$|Convection of the {{churning}} brine and conduction from surrounding rock transfers heat to an overlaying layer of fresh groundwater. Movement {{of the two}} liquids is facilitated by the highly fractured and porous nature of the rocks under the Yellowstone Plateau. [...] Some silica is dissolved from the fractured rhyolite into the hot water as it travels through the fractured rock. Part of this hard mineral is later redeposited {{on the walls of}} the cracks and fissures to make a nearly pressure-tight system. Silica precipitates at the surface to form either <b>geyserite</b> or sinter, creating the massive geyser cones, the scalloped edges of hot springs, and the seemingly barren landscape of geyser basins.|$|E
2500|$|The {{geothermal}} {{areas of}} Yellowstone include several geyser basins in Yellowstone National Park {{as well as}} other geothermal features such as hot springs, mud pots, and fumaroles. The number of thermal features in Yellowstone is estimated at 10,000. [...] A study that was completed in 2011 found that a total of 1,283 geysers have erupted in Yellowstone, 465 of which are active during an average year. [...] These are distributed among nine geyser basins, with a few geysers found in smaller thermal areas throughout the Park. [...] The number of geysers in each geyser basin are as follows: Upper Geyser Basin (410), Midway Geyser Basin (59), Lower Geyser Basin (283), Norris Geyser Basin (193), West Thumb Geyser Basin (84), Gibbon Geyser Basin (24), Lone Star Geyser Basin (21), Shoshone Geyser Basin (107), Heart Lake Geyser Basin (69), other areas (33). [...] Although famous large geysers like Old Faithful are part of the total, most of Yellowstone's geysers are small, erupting to only a foot or two. [...] The hydrothermal system that supplies the geysers with hot water sits within an ancient active caldera. [...] Many of the thermal features in Yellowstone build up sinter, <b>geyserite,</b> or travertine deposits around and within them.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, Earth {{remains the}} only place in the Universe known to harbour life, and fossil {{evidence}} from the Earth informs most studies of abiogenesis. More than 99% of all species of life forms, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct. The age of the Earth is about 4.54 billion years old; the earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates from at least 3.5 billion years ago, and possibly as early as the Eoarchean Era (between 3.6 and 4.0 billion years ago), after geological crust started to solidify following the molten Hadean Eon. In May 2017, evidence of the earliest known life on land may have been found in 3.48-billion-year-old <b>geyserite</b> and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. However, there have been a number of discoveries that suggested the earliest appearance of life on Earth was even earlier. Currently, microfossils within hydrothermal vent precipitates dated from 3.77 to 4.28 billion years old found in Quebec, Canada may be the oldest record of life on Earth, suggesting [...] "an almost instantaneous emergence of life" [...] after ocean formation 4.4 billion years ago. According to biologist Stephen Blair Hedges, [...] "If life arose relatively quickly on Earth … then it could be common in the universe." ...|$|E
