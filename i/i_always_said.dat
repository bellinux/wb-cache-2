500|$|When Dixon first {{emerged into}} the public {{spotlight}} with Mis-Teeq, she was primarily the group's MC, whilst one of her band-mates Sabrina Washington usually sang lead vocals on the records. Washington encouraged her to rap from the band's inception, saying: [...] "When she started she was a bit shy, but <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that it adds something, an element of difference. It {{was the first time}} I'd ever heard a woman MC and I was like, 'Alesha, you have got to do that,' and she was like 'No Bri, don't make me look stupid'". However, when she began her solo career her first UK album, The Alesha Show, saw Dixon undergo a genre-shift. The album featured no rapping and was primarily R and soul, unlike Mis-Teeq's music, which focused mainly on garage and hip hop. Dixon commented that the record consisted of [...] "a lot more guitar-written songs with pop produced around it". Dixons third album The Entertainer consists mainly of uptempo pop and dance-pop tracks.|$|E
500|$|After {{being hired}} by Jive Records {{to create a}} remix for [...] "Oveprotected", Rodney Jerkins {{revealed}} that the label [...] "needed a remix that's crazy." [...] Jerkins said the remix has [...] "an old-school-type rhythm, which I think is kinda cool because it's an element [...] never had, but I still gave it her edge. I was up all night rocking that joint. [...] same lyrics, I just reproduced the track." [...] "The Darkchild Remix" [...] was initially being sent to radio stations in the United States in mid-March 2002 and then became the opening track of the compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 10 later that year; however, it was only released on April 1, 2002. The remix was heavily played in dance clubs, and Jerkins said he wasn't surprised with the popularity of it, since [...] " [...] reinvented herself. Everybody thought she was gonna come back with another 'Oops!... I Did It Again', but she went left and came with the 'I'm a Slave 4 U' joint, which is basically a club banger. You gotta big up people who reinvent themselves. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> she was gonna {{be one of the}} people that's gonna be around for a minute, because I see that in her." [...] Finnish musician and record producer Jaakko Salovaara also created two remixes for the track, titled [...] "JS16 Dub" [...] and [...] "JS16 Remix". The latter was included on the promotional soundtrack of Spears' debut movie, Crossroads (2002).|$|E

500|$|In October 1996, {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} BBC bosses had approached Brown about reprising {{her role as}} Dot Cotton and, according to the Daily Mirror, Brown had been in negotiations with EastEnders for several months prior. Brown is quoted by the paper as saying, [...] "I have always been reluctant to go back because I thought Dot's character was not being portrayed properly. I thought it had faded. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> if Dot comes back it must be as Dot." [...] Brown secured a deal to return and began filming on-location in Gravesend in February 1997. The episode saw Dot's former lodger, Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley), visiting Dot to discover that Nick was once again in prison, leaving Dot alone. Her return episode aired in April 1997. Brown has since revealed that she opted to return to EastEnders to raise her profile again. She had originally only intended to return for a 3-month stint, but was persuaded to stay when a project she {{had been working on}} was cancelled. In July 1997, she commented, [...] "I've decided to stay in EastEnders. They asked me, and in the end I thought: 'Oh well, I might as well.' Everyone, including Barbara Windsor, Wendy Richard and Adam Woodyatt, was saying: 'Don't leave'. And people were coming up in the street saying: 'It's lovely to have you back.' Anyway, I find playing the old dear quite fun." [...] After a 5-month break, following Dot being held hostage in her flat by the escaped convict friend of her son, Brown returned to filming in October 1997 on a permanent contract.|$|E
2500|$|The band went on hiatus from 2000 to 2003, with Claypool later stating: [...] "The {{end of the}} Nineties was {{an unhappy}} Primus camp. I hit a {{creative}} stagnation that wasn't helping us forward, and the personal elements, it just was time to stop. And I had been asked for many years, [...] "How long can Primus go on?" [...] And <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'll do it until it's not fun anymore." [...] And it just wasn't fun anymore on many different levels." ...|$|E
2500|$|Walter Hill thought [...] "the {{audience}} {{will go with}} you when you set up an abstract world with teenage values and play out a drama within this. It was kind of real but it wasn't really. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> whenever someone says fantasy they immediately think of more Disney--esque. The idea of a hard hitting drama in a fantasy world, that was kind of different at the time... I always thought of it as a musical. They kind of saw it worked in the world of an MTV video.|$|E

2500|$|At the 2014 World Indoor Championships in Poland, Theisen {{captured}} {{silver in}} pentathlon {{with a personal}} best score of 4768, breaking her own national record. She next competed at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow where {{she went on to}} win the gold medal in the women's heptathlon event ahead of compatriot Jessica Zelinka. After she said, [...] "So this gold medal makes me really happy. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> I don't think I would get choked up but I had to fight back a few tears [...] It's just representing your country and knowing everybody back home is happy and watching and supporting you. It feels really good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pete's catchphrase was [...] "alright treacle?" [...] {{pronounced}} [...] "awight treacle", {{often used}} when addressing female characters. Peter Dean has discussed why the catchphrase came into existence: [...] "I had this saying - treacle. There was this long scene with Den and his mistress and I {{had to ask}} her for a drink, but I completely forgot her name, so said 'Give us a drink, treacle'. And after the episode came out, the actress said her children kept calling her treacle! A couple of scriptwriters wanted to stop it - they didn't want any catchphrases. But one lovely writer put it in so I could say {{it was in the}} script! And it stuck. Poor people couldn't afford sugar so put treacle in their tea. And it just means someone sweet and nice. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> it and my granddad said it. Even now {{people come up to me}} and ask if I'll say 'awight treacle' down their mobile phone to someone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following on from Martin Kemp's {{decision}} to quit EastEnders, Outhwaite announced she was quitting the soap {{in the autumn}} of 2001, stating, [...] "I'm not sure what was left for Mel to do after she had been kidnapped, been married twice, burnt down a club and slept with her best friend's husband [...] To be honest with you, Mel's role in EastEnders has come to a kind of natural end. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> I'd go when I felt that the character had run her course, and I'm going to leave when my contract runs out next year [...] Martin and I are in very similar situations with our characters. We came in at a similar time, and now it looks like we'll leave at a similar time, too. Mel and Steve had some kind of aura, a chemistry, that was unique. I was really proud of it." [...] She added, [...] "I'll always be indebted to EastEnders for providing me with a wonderful start to my career on television and the opportunity to play a character like Mel has been fabulous. I felt {{it was time to move}} on and try on a new coat â€“ new characters, new challenges." [...] EastEnders executive producer John Yorke said of Outhwaite's departure, [...] "Tamzin has created one of the most-loved characters and (with Martin Kemp) one half of the most-admired on-screen couple in EastEnders since the show started. She has been fantastic to work with and we wish her all the luck in her career." [...] Yorke added that the character would be welcome back any time.|$|E
