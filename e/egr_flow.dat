5000|$|The first EGR {{systems were}} crude; some were {{as simple as}} an orifice jet between the exhaust and intake tracts which {{admitted}} exhaust to the intake tract whenever the engine was running. Difficult starting, rough idling, and reduced performance and fuel economy resulted. By 1973, an EGR valve controlled by manifold vacuum opened or closed to admit exhaust to the intake tract only under certain conditions. Control systems grew more sophisticated as automakers gained experience; Chrysler's [...] "Coolant Controlled Exhaust Gas Recirculation" [...] system of 1973 exemplified this evolution: a coolant temperature sensor blocked vacuum to the EGR valve until the engine reached normal operating temperature. This prevented driveability problems due to unnecessary exhaust induction; NOx forms under elevated temperature conditions generally not present with a cold engine. Moreover, the EGR valve was controlled, in part, by vacuum drawn from the carburetor's venturi, which allowed more precise constraint of <b>EGR</b> <b>flow</b> to only those engine load conditions under which NOx is likely to form. Later, backpressure transducers {{were added to the}} EGR valve control to further tailor <b>EGR</b> <b>flow</b> to engine load conditions. Most modern engines now need exhaust gas recirculation to meet emissions standards. However, recent innovations have {{led to the development of}} engines that do not require them. The 3.6 Chrysler Pentastar engine is one example that does not require EGR.|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{combustion}} strategies, such as Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI), {{have been}} identified as one method to achieve future emissions and fuel economy regulations for diesel engines. These advanced combustion strategies require precise inputs to the combustion process to maintain stable combustion, maximize fuel efficiency, and minimize emissions. Given that the inputs to the combustion process can be considered outputs of the gas exchange process, an accurate understanding of the dynamics of the gas exchange process is critical to accurate control of the combustion process. ^ The work presented in this thesis focuses on modeling for estimation and the estimation of exhaust gas recirculation (<b>EGR)</b> <b>flow.</b> In the process of developing a candidate estimation strategy for the <b>EGR</b> <b>flow,</b> extensive efforts were focused on the development of a physically-based, control-oriented, gas exchange model; specifically, the development of an exhaust enthalpy model for application in the gas exchange model. The exhaust enthalpy model is utilized to determine the temperature of gas flow out of the cylinder. This is accomplished by first determining the conditions in the cylinder when the intake valve close (IVC) then assuming a polytropic compression process to top dead center (TDC). To maintain simplicity in the model, fuel injection is neglected, and it is assumed that combustion begins at TDC in a constant pressure process until the end of combustion (EOC). Upon completion of combustion, the expansion process is modeled as a polytropic expansion process until the exhaust valves open (EVO). The proposed model for exhaust gas enthalpy was extensively experimentally validated against 193 data points and is shown to accurately predict the exhaust gas temperature, generally well within 10 % error. ^ Ultimately, the gas exchange model, including the exhaust gas enthalpy model, was utilized in the development of an estimation strategy for <b>EGR</b> <b>flow.</b> The estimation strategy utilizes the exhaust manifold pressure state equation and feedback from the exhaust manifold pressure sensor, as well as models of the <b>EGR</b> <b>flow,</b> charge flow, and turbine flow to estimate the <b>EGR</b> <b>flow.</b> Preliminary validation of the estimator has been accomplished utilizing both the gas exchange model and GT-POWER simulations, with the results demonstrating that with accurate models for charge flow and turbine flow, the estimator can accurately predict the <b>EGR</b> <b>flow.</b> ...|$|E

The intrinsic model accuracy limit of a commonly used Exhaust Gas Recirculation (<b>EGR)</b> mass <b>flow</b> rate model in diesel engine air path control is discussed in this paper. This <b>EGR</b> mass <b>flow</b> rate model {{is based on the}} flow of a compressible ideal gas with unchanged specific heat ratio through a restriction cross-area within a duct. A practical identification procedure of the model parameters is proposed based on the analysis of the engine data and model structure. This procedure has several advantages which include simplicity, low computation burden and low engine test cost. It is shown that model tuning requires only an EGR valve sweep test at a few engine steady state operating points. It is also shown that good model accuracy can be achieved when the control variables of other air path devices, e. g. The vane position of a Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) and the torque demand of an Electric Turbo Assist (ETA), are kept constant during the EGR valve sweep test used to tune the model. Two different diesel engines are used in this work to demonstrate the model tuning procedure and the model validation results. Both engines are equipped with a high pressure external EGR system and a VGT. One of the engines has a relatively new air system device - an ETA. The model validation results of both engines show good model accuracy not only at steady state engine operating points but also during engine transients...|$|R
40|$|The exhaust {{manifold}} pressure {{is a crucial}} variable for turbocharged Diesel engines, affecting the torque production and the emissions through variations in the <b>EGR</b> mass <b>flow</b> and in the residual mass fraction in the cylinder.

40|$|Due to {{its impact}} on {{human health and the}} nature {{surrounding}} us, diesel engine emissions have been significantly reduced over the last two decades. This reduction has been enforced by the legislating organs around the world that gradually have made the manufacturers transform their engines to todayâs complex high-tech products. One of the most challenging areas to meet the legislations is transient operation where the inertia in gas-exchange system makes transition from one load to another problematic. Â  Modern engines have great potential to minimize the problems associated with transient operation. However, their complexity also imposes a great challenge regarding optimization and systematical testing of transient control strategies in an engine test bed could be both expensive and time consuming. Â  The objective of this project is to facilitate optimization of transient control strategies. This should be done by identifying appropriate measurement methods for evaluation of transients and by providing models {{that can be used to}} optimize strategies off-line. Â  Measurement methods for evaluation of transients have been tested in several experiments, mainly focusing on emission but also regarding e. g. <b>EGR</b> <b>flow.</b> Applicable instruments for transient emission measurements have been identified and used.

40|$|Exhaust gas {{recirculation}} (EGR) is a nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions reduction technique used in petrol/gasoline and diesel engines. By recirculating {{a portion of}} an engine 2 Ì 7 s exhaust, inert gas displaces combustible matter in the cylinder. Because NOx forms primarily when a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen is subjected to high temperature, the lower combustion chamber temperatures caused by EGR decrease the amount of NOx combustion generates. This project aims at optimizing {{the location of the}} EGR ports, which are crucial to the operation and efficiency of the EGR system.

40|$|This study {{proposed}} a gain scheduled controller for {{exhaust gas recirculation}} (EGR) and variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) systems with a model-based gain scheduling strategy to manage strong nonlinearity in diesel engines. The feedback controller uses a gain scheduling strategy to obtain appropriate controller gains of the PI controller under various engine operating conditions. The gain scheduling strategy is designed using the proposed static gain model that predicts varying static gains of EGR and VGT plants. The static gain model uses scheduling variables derived from indirect measurements of the <b>EGR</b> mass <b>flow</b> such as the pressure ratio of the intake and exhaust manifolds and the exhaust air-to-fuel ratio. The scheduling variables are effective to reduce a large static gain dispersion caused by various operating conditions of the EGR and VGT actuators. With the predicted static gains of the plant, a Skogestad internal model control (SIMC) method determines PI gains in runtime. The proposed control algorithm is evaluated through engine experiments. The experimental results proved that the integrated absolute error (IAE) and overshoot of the gain scheduled feedback controller are significantly reduced compared to the fixed gain controller.

40|$|In this work, a low-order five {{state model}} of the air {{handling}} system for a multi-cylinder variable geometry turbocharged diesel engine, with cooled exhaust gas recirculation and flexible intake valve actuation, is developed and validated against 286 steady state and 62 transient engine operating points. The model utilizes engine speed, engine fueling, EGR valve position, VGT nozzle position and intake valve closing time as inputs to the model. The model outputs include calculation for the engine flows {{as well as the}} exhaust temperature exiting the cylinder. The gas exchange model captures the dynamic effects of not only the standard air handling actuators (EGR valve position and VGT position) but also intake valve closing (IVC) timing, exercised over their useful operating ranges, and thus is critical for designing robust controllers. The model 2 Ì 7 s capabilities are enabled through the use of analytical functions to describe the performance of the turbocharger, eliminating the need to use look-up maps; a physically-based control-oriented exhaust gas enthalpy sub-model, and a physically-based volumetric efficiency sub-model. Traditional empirical or regression-based models for volumetric efficiency, while suitable for conventional valve trains, are therefore challenged by flexible valve trains. The added complexity and additional empirical data needed for wide valve timing ranges limit the usefulness of these methods. A simple physically-based volumetric efficiency model was developed to address these challenges. The model captures the major physical processes occurring over the intake stroke, and is applicable to both conventional and flexible intake valve trains. The model inputs include temperature and pressure in both the intake and exhaust manifolds, intake and exhaust valve event timings, engine cylinder bore, stroke, connecting rod lengths, engine speed and effective compression ratio. The model is physically-based, requires no regression tuning parameters, is generalizable to other engine platforms, and has been experimentally validated using an advanced multi-cylinder diesel engine equipped with a fully flexible variable intake valve actuation system. ^ The in-cylinder oxygen fraction serves as a critical control input to these strategies, but is extremely difficult to measure on production engines. Fortunately, estimates or measurements of the oxygen fraction in the intake and exhaust manifold, the in-cylinder charge mass, and residual mass can be utilized to calculate the in-cylinder oxygen fraction. This work outlines such a physically-based, generalizable strategy to estimate the in-cylinder oxygen fraction from only production viable measurements or estimates of exhaust oxygen fraction, fresh air flow, charge flow, fuel flow, turbine flow and <b>EGR</b> <b>flow.</b> The oxygen fraction estimates are compared to laboratory grade measurements available for the intake and exhaust manifolds. The oxygen fraction estimates will be shown to be particularly sensitive to errors in the EGR and turbine flow.

40|$|Abstract: In diesel engines, {{accurate}} EGR {{control is}} important {{due to its}} effect on nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions. Conventional EGR control system comprises a PI feedback controller for tracking target air mass flow and a feedforward controller for fast response. Physically, the <b>EGR</b> <b>flow</b> is affected by EGR valve lift and thermodynamic properties of the EGR path, such as pressures and temperatures. However, the conventional feedforward control output is indirectly derived from engine operating conditions, such as engine rotational speed and fuel injection quantity. Accordingly, the conventional feedforward control action counteracts the feedback controller in certain operating conditions. In order to improve this disadvantage, in this study, we proposed feedforward EGR control algorithm based on a physical model of the EGR system.

40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} {{regulations and}} rising fuel costs require that automotive manufacturers reduce their fleet CO 2 emissions. Gasoline engine downsizing {{is one such}} technology {{at the forefront of}} improvements in fuel economy. As engine downsizing becomes more aggressive, normal engine operating points are moving into higher load regions, typically requiring over-fuelling to maintain exhaust gas temperatures within component protection limits and retarded ignition timings in order to mitigate knock and pre-ignition events. These two mechanisms are counterproductive, since the retarded ignition timing delays combustion, in turn raising exhaust gas temperature. A key process being used to inhibit the occurrence of these knock and pre-ignition phenomena is cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Cooled EGR lowers temperatures during the combustion process, reducing the possibility of knock, and can thus reduce or eliminate the need for over-fuelling. It has also been shown to reduce exhaust gas temperature and improve combustion efficiency through improved combustion phasing. This paper reviews data collected on âULTRABOOSTâ, a collaborative research project which is co-funded by the Technology Strategy Board, the UK's innovation agency. The project is based on a prototype, heavily downsized 2. 0 L DISI engine running under controlled boost conditions, featuring low pressure or âlong routeâ EGR. This allows for the EGR feed gas to be fed from either pre- or post-catalyst sampling points. This paper will present data collected at equivalent operating conditions using both catalyzed and un-catalyzed exhaust gas to feed the EGR system. Some comparison of equivalent BMEP levels will be made {{but this is not the}} focus of the investigation. Current standards utilize a CO 2 ratio for EGR measurement, but the results presented highlight inaccuracies in this measurement method when repeatable test conditions for pre- and post-catalyst EGR routes are required due to the significant changes in gas composition pre- and post-catalyst. The test engine was artificially boosted utilizing a Combustion Air Handling Unit to simulate commercially available turbo-machinery, which allowed for the catalyst effects to be assessed in isolation.

40|$|Most {{downsized}} gasoline engines {{currently in}} the market place {{appear to have a}} âdownsizing factorâ of approximately 30 % to 40 %. However, as concerns regarding fuel efficiency and emission legislations increase, more aggressive downsizing may have to be introduced. This, although can improve fuel efficiency and enhance power density of a gasoline engine further, has some challenges that must be addressed. Large backpressure {{is one of the most}} important aspects that needs to be improved for a highly downsized gasoline engine, especially if a Regulated 2 -stage system is considered. The Divided Exhaust Period (DEP) concept is an alternative gas exchange process, where two exhaust valves from each cylinder separately function, with one valve leading the blow-down pulse into the turbocharger turbine, while the remainder of the exhaust mass flow bypasses the turbine through the other valve. The simulation results suggest that by adopting the DEP concept, the full-load Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) and the stability of the engine were all improved due to the fact that the DEP concept features a better gas exchange process and improved combustion phasing. The part-load BSFC could also be reduced by using the scavenging valve to extend the âdurationâ of the exhaust valve (thus reducing the re-compression effect) and to achieve internal exhaust gas recirculation (<b>EGR)</b> through reverse <b>flow.</b> However, this depends on the authorities of the scavenging valve timing (and piston clearance) and the combustion stability (EGR tolerance). Driveability issue and poor fuel efficiency in some engine operating regions of a conventional fixed-ratio positive-displacement supercharging system also need to be mitigated. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) driven supercharging solution, with the capability to decouple the supercharger speed from the engine speed, has the potential to provide the full-load BSFC improvement and to enhance the driveability performance, with a minor penalty in part-load BSFC. Both the simulation and experimental results have demonstrated its advantages over its fixed-ratio positive-displacement counterpart. The high-load fuel consumption can be improved by as much as 17. 5 %, and the time-to-torque performance can be improved by up to 37 %. The low-load BSFC was only degraded by up to 2 %, however, given that there was no clutch fitted for the CVT driven supercharging system, a better transient performance is anticipated...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{turbulent}} mixing processes occurring in internal combustion engines, when applying {{exhaust gas recirculation}} (EGR). EGR is a very efficient way to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in internal combustion engines. Exhaust gases are recirculated and mixed with the fresh intake air, reducing the oxygen con- centration of the combustion gas and thus the peak combustion temperatures. This temperature decrease results in a reduction of NOx emissions. When applying EGR, one is often faced with non-uniform distribution of exhaust among and inside the cylinders, deteriorating the emission performance. The mixing of exhaust gases and air is governed by the flow in the engine intake manifold, which is characterized by unsteadiness due to turbulence and engine pulsations. Moreover, the density cannot be assumed to be constant due {{to the presence of}} large temperature variations. Different flow cases having these characteristics are computed by compressible Large Eddy Simulations (LES). First, the stationary flows in two T-junction type geometries are investigated. The method is validated by comparison with experimental data and the accuracy of the simulations is confirmed by grid sensitivity studies. The flow structures and the unsteady flow modes are described for a range of mass flow ratios between the main and the branch inlet. A comparison to RANS computations showed qualitatively different flow fields. Thereafter, pulsating inflow conditions are prescribed on the branch inlet in or- der to mimic the large pulsations occurring in the <b>EGR</b> loop. The <b>flow</b> modes are investigated using Dynamical Mode Decomposition (DMD). After having established the simulation tool, the flow in a six-cylinder engine is simulated. The flow is studied by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and DMD. The mixing quality is studied in terms of cylinder-to-cylinder non-uniformity and temporal and spatial variances. It was found that cycle-averaging of the concentration may give misleading results. A sensitivity study with respect to changes in the boundary conditions showed that the EGR pulsations, have large influence on the results. This could also be shown by POD of the concentration field showing the significance of the pulses for the maldistribution of exhaust gases. Finally, the flow in an intake manifold of a four-cylinder engine is investigated in terms of EGR distribution. For this geometry, pipe bends upstream of the EGR inlet were found to be responsible for the maldistribution. QC 20130207 </p...|$|R

40|$|DI {{diesel engines}} are well {{established}} {{today as the}} main powertrain solution for trucks and other relevant heavy duty vehicles. At the same time emission legislation (mainly for NO, and particulate matter) becomes stricter, reducing their limit to extremely low values. One efficient method to control NO, {{in order to achieve}} future emissions limits is the use of rather high exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates accompanied by increased boost pressure to avoid the negative impact on soot emissions. The method is based on the reduction of gas temperature level and O- 2 availability inside the combustion chamber, but unfortunately it has usually an adverse effect on soot emissions and brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc). The use of high EGR rates creates the need for EGR gas cooling in order to minimize its negative impact on soot emissions especially at high engine load were the <b>EGR</b> <b>flow</b> rate and exhaust temperature are high. For this reason in the present paper it is examined, using a multi-zone combustion model, the effect of cooled EGR gas temperature level for various EGR percentages on performance and emissions of a turbocharged DI heavy duty diesel engine operating at full load. Results reveal that the decrease of EGR gas temperature has a positive effect on bsfc, soot (lower values) while it has only a small positive effect on NO. As revealed, the effect of low EGR temperature is stronger at high EGR rates. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Copyright Â© 2010 SAE International In a {{gasoline}} engine, the cycle-by-cycle fresh trapped charge, and corresponding unswept residual gas fraction (RGF) are critical parameters {{of interest for}} maintaining the desired air-fuel ratio (AFR). Accurate fueling is a key precursor to improved engine fuel economy, and reduced engine out emissions. Asymmetric flow paths to cylinders in certain engines can cause differences in the gas exchange process, which in turn cause imbalances in trapped fresh charge and RGF. Variable cam timing (VCT) can make the gas exchange process even more complex. Due to the reasons stated above, simplified models can result in significant estimation errors for fresh trapped charge and RGF {{if they are not}} gas dynamics-based or detailed enough to handle features such as variable valve timing, duration, or lift. In this paper, a new air flow and RGF measurement tool is introduced. The tool is a combination of 1 -D gas dynamics modeling and imposed, measured dynamic pressure signals in the intake and exhaust manifolds. With this method, the components to be modeled in the gas exchange system are reduced to a minimum, making it possible to model the gas exchange process with adequate detail and still maintain reasonable tool execution time. In this approach, the accuracy of the air flow and RGF estimation are not influenced by the location of pressure transducers and it is possible to âtrack â <b>EGR</b> <b>flow</b> from the exhaust to the intake system. The tool is demonstrated on a 4 -cylinder gasoline engine powered vehicle with dual intake and exhaust cam phasing. Predictions from the tool are compared to AFR and other real-time signals measured during a variety of different real-world transient drive cycles. The instantaneous fresh trapped charge, RGF across all cylinders, as well as the influence of VCT actuation is discussed...|$|E
