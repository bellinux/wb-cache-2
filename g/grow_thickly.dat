60|$|The children's {{stockings}} were so {{long that}} it required a great many toys to fill them, and soon Claus found {{there were other things}} besides toys that children love. So he sent some of the Fairies, who were always his good friends, into the Tropics, from whence they returned with great bags full of oranges and bananas which they had plucked from the trees. And other Fairies flew to the wonderful Valley of Phunnyland, where delicious candies and bonbons <b>grow</b> <b>thickly</b> on the bushes, and returned laden with many boxes of sweetmeats for the little ones. These things Santa Claus, on each Christmas Eve, placed in the long stockings, together with his toys, and the children were glad to get them, you may be sure.|$|E
60|$|Philip {{followed}} {{him across the}} passage and was shown into a room, small and barely furnished, in which a little, thin man was standing {{with his back to}} the fireplace. He was much below the middle height, but his large head, which seemed to hang loosely on his body, gave him an odd ungainliness. His features were wide and flattened, and he had prominent, pale eyes; his thin hair was sandy; he wore whiskers that grew unevenly on his face, and in places where you would have expected the hair to <b>grow</b> <b>thickly</b> there was no hair at all. His skin was pasty and yellow. He held out his hand to Philip, and when he smiled showed badly decayed teeth. He spoke with a patronising and at the same time a timid air, as though he sought to assume an importance which he did not feel. He said he hoped Philip would like the work; there was a good deal of drudgery about it, but when you got used to it, it was interesting; and one made money, that was the chief thing, wasn't it? He laughed with his odd mixture of superiority and shyness.|$|E
60|$|Slone {{was packed}} and saddled {{and on his}} way before the sun reddened the canyon wall. He walked the horses. From time to time he saw signs of Wildfire's {{consistent}} progress. The canyon narrowed and the walls grew lower and the grass increased. There was a decided ascent all the time. Slone could find {{no evidence that the}} canyon had ever been traveled by hunters or Indians. The day was pleasant and warm and still. Every once in a while a little breath of wind would bring a fragrance of cedar and pinyon, and a sweet hint of pine and sage. At every turn he looked ahead, expecting to see the green of pine and the gray of sage. Toward the middle of the afternoon, coming to a place where Wildfire had taken to a trot, he put Nagger to that gait, and by sundown had worked up to where the canyon was only a shallow ravine. And finally it turned once more, to lose itself in a level where straggling pines stood high above the cedars, and great, dark-green silver spruces stood above the pines. And here were patches of sage, fresh and pungent, and long reaches of bleached grass. It was the edge of a forest. Wildfire's trail went on. Slone came at length to a group of pines, and here he found the remains of a camp-fire, and some flint arrow-heads. Indians had been in there, probably having come from the opposite direction to Slone's. This encouraged him, for where Indians could hunt so could he. Soon he was entering a forest where cedars and pinyons and pines began to <b>grow</b> <b>thickly.</b> Presently he came upon a faintly defined trail, just a dim, dark line even to an experienced eye. But it was a trail, and Wildfire had taken it.|$|E

5000|$|Already {{identified}} as a significant forest invader in the mid-Atlantic region, Phellodendron amurense is an emerging species of concern in New England, and is {{identified as}} invasive or having invasive tendencies by state and private conservation authorities. [...] Because the fruit is plentiful and high in sugars, Amur cork-tree attracts birds and mammals which help disperse its seeds. Because of its phytochemical profile and because the seedlings <b>grow</b> <b>thickly,</b> Phellodendron can out-compete other species. By suppressing reproduction of native hardwoods, Amur cork-tree can come to dominate native forests under favorable conditions. As a relatively new species of concern, its invasion biology and response to control are not well understood.|$|E

40|$|In this report, {{we discuss}} whether the optimal {{electric}} field {{to promote the}} growth of armchair- type nanotubes (metallic character) evaluated using the previous Huckel-Poisson method can be applied {{at the tip of}} a nanotube in a realistic system. Setting the cross-section of a nanotube and the external field by the sheath, we estimate an effective area at the sheath edge. Since the electric charge distribution in a nanotube caused by the external electric field was determined in our previous study, we obtained the electric field distribution out of a nanotube by solving the Poisson equation and clarified the structure of the electric field lines. By determining the effective area, we show the optimal interval of the catalyst metal, which is necessary to selectively grow the metallic nanotubes. When nanotubes <b>grow</b> <b>thickly</b> during the initial stage of growth, a strong electric field cannot be applied to the tips of the tubes. As a tube grows and the tube length increases, we found that the optimal electric field decreased. To maintain the chemical activity at the tip, the sheath electric field must be decreased. We estimated the decreasing rate of the sheath field to the tube length. Comment: 12 th International Congress on Plasma Physics, 25 - 29 October 2004, Nice (France...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the possibility of}} reducing of weeding operations to facilitate {{the development of a}} low-cost silviculture system. The study area was located in the Takakuma Experimental Forest of Kagoshima University. The operational time of weeding at a young sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) stand were recordrd during four growing seasons. The stand was divided into five sections, with different weeding schedules used in each section: weeding four times during the 4 -year period (every year), three times, or twice (alternate years). The mean heights of the herbaceous and woody coppices and the degrees of visibility of neighbor planted trees in the stand were measured because these values could affect the efficiency of the weeding operation. The following results were obtained: The operational time per hectare of the weeding twice operations were 30 - 57 % shorter than the weeding four times it, on the other hand the weeding three times operation was 20 % shorter or 5 % longer than the weeding four times it. If the weeding operation frequencies were reduced to half or three fourths, the operational time of weeding didn't reduced by half or three fourths. The reduced weeding schedules caused the herbaceous and woody coppices to <b>grow</b> <b>thickly</b> the following year, which resulted in the need for more weeding the following year...|$|E
