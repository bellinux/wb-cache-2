50|$|The African <b>helmeted</b> <b>turtle</b> is a {{omnivore}} eater {{and will}} eat almost anything. It may feed on carrion. The fine claws {{on its feet}} help it tear its prey apart.|$|E
50|$|The African <b>helmeted</b> <b>turtle</b> (Pelomedusa subrufa), {{also known}} as the marsh terrapin, {{crocodile}} turtle, or in the pet trade as African side-necked turtle, is an omnivorous side-necked terrapin that naturally occurs in fresh and stagnant water bodies throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa, and even in southern Yemen.|$|E
50|$|Snakes {{found in}} Yemen include the Egyptian cobra, the horned viper and the puff adder, {{as well as}} several species of sea snakes. There is an endemic monitor lizard (Varanus yemensis), {{numerous}} species of lizard, several geckos and the veiled chameleon. The African <b>helmeted</b> <b>turtle</b> and tortoise are found on land, and several species of sea turtle breed on the beaches.|$|E
25|$|Lake Victoria and its {{wetlands}} has a {{large population}} of Nile crocodiles, as well as African <b>helmeted</b> <b>turtles,</b> variable mud turtles, and Williams' mud turtle. The Williams' mud turtle is restricted to Lake Victoria and other lakes, rivers, and swamps in the upper Nile basin.|$|R
50|$|Uniquely, Pelomedusa {{does not}} have a hinged {{plastron}} (lower shell). All the other species in the family Pelomedusidae, however, have this feature which they can, using muscles, close to cover their heads and front limbs. Unlike many chelonians, African <b>helmeted</b> <b>turtles</b> are able, when they find themselves upside down, to right themselves with a vigorous flick from their long muscular necks.|$|R
50|$|Several {{large mammals}} such as warthogs, Cape buffalo and Rhinoceroses have {{recently}} been documented utilizing the turtles to remove parasites at popular wallowing holes. One such incident in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park involved two African <b>helmeted</b> <b>turtles</b> removing ticks and blood-sucking flies {{from the body of}} a wallowing warthog. Though the turtles probably do not have a symbiotic relationship with these animals, it is very likely that the buffalo, rhinos and warthogs seek them out and have learned to utilize them from past experiences. This behavior was documented {{for the first time in}} the September 2015 issue of Herpetological Review by Andy and Michelle Leighty Jones.|$|R
50|$|Relatively few {{families}} and genera of reptile have reached Madagascar {{but they have}} diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90% of these being endemic. The chameleons are very well represented with two-thirds of the world's species found there. The other lizard groups on Madagascar are the geckoes, skinks, girdle-tailed lizards and iguanids. Over 60 different snakes occur on the island; none of these are harmful to man. There are six land tortoises species, five endemics and one introduced species (Bell's hinge-back tortoise). Land based turtles include the African <b>helmeted</b> <b>turtle,</b> yellow-bellied mud turtle and East African black mud turtle. The shores are used for nesting by the loggerhead sea turtle, green sea turtle and hawksbill sea turtle while the {{olive ridley sea turtle}} forages here. Madagascar's largest reptile is the Nile crocodile which has become very rare due to hunting for its skin. Endemic voay (V. robustus) became extinct.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{enemies of}} the red-billed quelea include other birds, snakes, warthogs, squirrels, galagos, monkeys, mongooses, genets, civets, foxes, jackals, hyaenas, cats, lions and leopards. Bird species preying on queleas {{included}} lanner falcon, tawny eagle and marabou stork. The diederik cuckoo is a brood parasite that probably lays eggs in nests of queleas. Some predators, such as snakes, raid nests and eat eggs and chicks. Nile crocodiles sometimes attack drinking queleas, and an individual in Ethiopia hit birds out of the vegetation on the bank into the water with its tail, subsequently eating them. Queleas drinking at a waterhole were grabbed from below by African <b>helmeted</b> <b>turtles</b> in Etosha. Among the invertebrates that kill and eat youngsters are the armoured bush cricket (Acanthoplus discoidalis) and the scorpion Cheloctonus jonesii. Internal parasites found in queleas include Haemoproteus and Plasmodium.|$|R
