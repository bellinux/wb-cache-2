40|$|Bench runs of a {{modified}} V- 1710 - 93 engine {{equipped with a}} two-stage supercharger, interstage carburetor, aftercooler assembly, and backfire screens have been made at a simulated altitude of 29, 000 feet {{to determine the effect}} of several induction-system modifications on the engine and supercharger performance. The standard guide vanes on the auxiliary- and engine-stage superchargers were replaced by rotating guide vanes with a parabolic blade profile. The auxiliary-stage <b>inlet</b> <b>elbow</b> and interstage duct were replaced with new units of NACA design. These modifications were made one at a time and data were obtained after each change to determine the effect of each modification. All runs were made at a constant engine speed of 3000 rpm at a simulated altitude of 29, 000 feet and all changes in engine power were made by varying the speed of the auxiliary-stage supercharger...|$|E
40|$|The {{flow pattern}} inside {{rectangular}} intake air duct of 300 MW lignite {{coal-fired power plant}} is investigated in order to analyze and reduce overall inlet system pressure drop. The system consists of the 45 -degree <b>inlet</b> <b>elbow,</b> the flow instrument, the 90 -degree mitered elbow and fans, respectively. The energy loss in each section can be determined by Bernoulli’s equation and ASHRAE standard table. Hence, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is {{used in this study}} based on Navier-Stroke equation and the standard k-epsilon turbulence modeling. Input boundary condition is 175 kg/s mass flow rate inside the 11 -m 2 cross sectional duct. According to the inlet air flow rate, the Reynolds number of airstream is 2. 7 x 106 (based on the hydraulic duct diameter), thus the flow behavior is turbulence. The numerical results are validated with the real operation data. It is found that the numerical result agrees well with the operating data, and dominant loss occurs at the flow rate measurement device. Normally, the air flow rate is measured by the airfoil and it gets high pressure drop inside the duct. To overcome this problem, the airfoil is planned to be replaced with the other type measuring instrument, such as the average pitot tube which generates low pressure drop of airstream. The numerical result in case of average pitot tube shows that the pressure drop inside the inlet airstream duct is decreased significantly. It {{should be noted that the}} energy consumption of inlet air system is reduced too...|$|E
50|$|The Phoebus {{made its}} first flight in February 1949. An Avro Lincoln, RA643, was used, with the engine {{installed}} in the bomb bay. Two air <b>inlet</b> <b>elbows</b> were provided {{at the sides of}} the bomb bay, with the jet exhaust angled steeply downwards. As the Phoebus used the same reverse-flow layout as the first Proteus, inlets from the side were appropriate.|$|R

The Hopetown Harbour Lodge {{is the largest}} hotel on the island at the south part of Hopetown. Cars and golf carts can drive up to, but not through Hopetown. Further south, there are more residences and rental properties spread out along the roads to the narrow {{part of the island}} near White Sound. The Abaco Inn and Seaspray properties offer rooms and restaurants. At the Southern end of the island is Tahiti Beach with a beautiful sand beach and nearby snorkelling in Tiloo Cut, the <b>inlet</b> separating <b>Elbow</b> Cay from Tiloo Cay.|$|R

40|$|Steel {{castings}} made of creep resistant steels play a {{key role}} in fossil fuel fired power plants, for highly loaded components in the high and intermediate pressure sections of a turbine. Inner, outer and valve casings, <b>inlet</b> pipes and <b>elbows</b> are examples for these critical components. In the development for higher efficiencies of the power plants and the improvement of creep resistance for the involved materials, also the casting steel grades have to be adapted to the increased demands on material properties. This paper shows the contribution of a steel foundry to the European COST-programme for the development of a new 10 %Cr steel grade. It also shows the introduction of the new 9 - 10 %Cr casting steels G-X 12 CrMoWVNbN 10 1 1 and G-X 12 CrMoVNbN 9 1 into commercial production of heavy castings...|$|R
40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] flow of lubricating greases in an elbow channel has been modeled and validated with velocity profiles from flow visualizations using micro-particle image velocimetry. The elbow geometry induces a non-symmetric distribution of shear stress throughout its cross section, as well as varying shear rates through {{the transition from the}} <b>elbow</b> <b>inlet</b> to the outlet. The flow has been modeled both for higher flow rates and for creep flow. The influence of the grease rheology and flow conditions to wall slip, shear banding and an observed stick-slip type of motion observed for low flow rates are presented. The effect on the flow of the applied pressure is also modeled showing that the flow is sensitive to the pressure in the angular (phi) direction of the elbow. For high pressures, it is shown that the flow is reversed adjacent to the elbow walls. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|R
40|$|We have {{proposed}} a two dimensional (2 D) circuit model of induction cavity. The oil elbow and azimuthal transmission line are modeled with one dimensional transmission line elements, while 2 D transmission line elements are employed to represent the regions inward the azimuthal transmission line. The voltage waveforms obtained by 2 D circuit simulation and transient electromagnetic simulation are compared, which shows satisfactory agreement. The influence of impedance mismatch on the power flow condition in the induction cavity is investigated with this 2 D circuit model. The simulation {{results indicate that the}} peak value of load voltage approaches the maximum if the azimuthal transmission line roughly matches the pulse forming section. The amplitude of output transmission line voltage is strongly influenced by its impedance, but the peak value of load voltage is insensitive to the actual output transmission line impedance. When the load impedance raises, the voltage across the dummy load increases, and the pulse duration at the oil <b>elbow</b> <b>inlet</b> and insulator stack regions also slightly increase...|$|R
40|$|Details of {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} two-phase gas-solid turbulent {{flow in the}} riser section of Circulating Fluidized Bed Reactor (CFBR) using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique are reported. Two CFBR riser configurations are considered and modeled. Each of these two riser models consist of <b>inlet,</b> exit, connecting <b>elbows</b> and a main pipe. Both riser configurations are cylindrical and have the same diameter but differ in their inlet lengths and main pipe height to enable investigation of riser geometrical scaling effects. In addition, two types of solid particles are exploited in the solid phase of the two-phase gas-solid riser flow simulations to study the influence of solid loading ratio on flow patterns. The gaseous phase in the two-phase flow is represented by standard atmospheric air. The CFD-based FLUENT software is employed to obtain steady state and transient solutions for flow modulations in the riser. The physical dimensions, types and numbers of computation meshes, and solution methodology utilized in the present work are stated. Flow parameters, such as static and dynamic pressure, species velocity, and volume fractions are monitored and analyzed. The differences in the computational results between the two models, under steady and transient conditions, are compared, contrasted, and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Elbow {{fittings}} is {{one type}} of fitting on the piping installation that serves to change the flow direction. With the sudden flow of changes, it will affect the physical condition of the elbow. The flow changes in the elbow will result in changes of  flow velocity that affect wall of elbow, the condition will cause erosion corrosion phenomenon.   Erosion corrotion {{is a type of}} corrosion that uses a mechanical process through the relative movement of the flow and metal. Corrosion erosion can also be caused by impingment corrotion or very rapid flow movement. This study aims to determine the cause of damage elbow by using a CFD simulation and troubleshooting by adding a Vortex Generator or a installed disturber system in the pipeline installation and simulating it again. From the results of research conducted that elbow damage caused by high flow velocity that concerns the outer elbow. The addition of Vortex Generator is proven to be used to reduce excessive flow velocity on erosion-corroded parts. According to the results of the investigation the placement of the most efficient vortex generator if placed at a distance of 0. 1 R from <b>elbow</b> <b>inlet...</b>|$|R
