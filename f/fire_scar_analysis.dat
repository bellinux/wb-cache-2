40|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>scar</b> <b>analysis</b> to {{identify}} fire events and stand age structure analysis {{to identify}} fire effects on survivorship of trees {{were used to}} reconstruct surface and crown fire regimes in upper elevation forests of the Gila Wilderness, NM. Fire regimes varied across forest type, but not necessarily across elevation. Prior to the twentieth century, (from 1706 to 1904), the mean return interval for large fires was 8 years. During the twentieth century, (from 1904 to 1995), the mean fire return interval for large fires was 46 years.

40|$|Fire {{history was}} {{determined}} by <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> <b>analysis</b> in a subalpine watershed in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. Evidence was found for 15 fires since 1600, of which 7 were manor fires that burned 3 ̆e 4 ha, destroyed the existing forest, and initiated secondary succession. Most of the upland forest area was burned by large, destructive fires {{in the middle and}} late 17002 ̆ 7 s. Fires since then have been small and have occurred at long intervals. Fire frequency in this area is partly controlled by changes in the fuel complex during succession. Fuels capable of supporting a crown fire usually do not develop until a stand is 300 - 400 yr old, and ignitions prior to that time usually extinguish naturally before covering more than a few hectares. Thereafter a destructive crown fires is likely whenever lightning ignites small fuels during warm, dry, windy weather. On the extensive subalpine plateaus of Yellowstone National Park {{there appears to be a}} natural fire cycle of 300 - 400 yr in which large areas burn during a short period., followed by a long, relatively fire-free period during which a highly flammable fuel complex again develops. The study area appears to be about midway between major fire events in this cycle. This, rather than human fire suppression, apparently is the major reason for the small number and size of fires in the area during the last 180 yr...|$|E

40|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>scar</b> and {{vegetation}} <b>analysis</b> {{were used to}} construct a fire history for the Engelmann spruce/subalpine fir (Picea engelmannii/Abies lasiocarpa) vegetation type of the Utah State University (USU) T. W. Daniel Experimental Forest. Three distinct periods of fire frequency were established - presettlement (1700 - 1855), settlement (1856 - 1909, and suppression era. The difference was attributed to the influx of ignition sources during the settlement of nearby Cache Valley, located 40 km to the west. Logging and livestock grazing appear to {{have led to the}} reduced MFI, which in turn worked as a factor to create the vegetative mosaic now observed on the study area. The increase in MFI during the suppression era premitted the advancement of shade-tolerant species in the understory of the shade-intolerant lodgepole pine (Pinus contora var. latifolia) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). Continued suppression of disturbance from wildfire will allow the lodgepole pine cover type, which experience the lowest MFI during the settlement period, to be further invaded by shade-tolerant species, decreasing spatial stand diversity and increasing the risk of more intense fires...|$|R
30|$|Comparisons between refuge fire records since 1975 {{and those}} {{recorded}} by tree rings showed good, but not perfect, agreement.

40|$|Fire regime {{characteristics}} of high-elevation forests on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, Arizona, were re-constructed from <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> <b>analysis,</b> remote sensing, tree age, and forest structure measurements, a {{first attempt at}} detailed reconstruction of the transition from surface to stand-replacing fire patterns in the Southwest. Tree den-sities and fire-/non-fire-initiated groups were highly mixed over the landscape, so distinct fire-created stands could not be delineated from satellite imagery or the oldest available aerial photos. Surface fires were common from 1700 to 1879 in the 4, 400 ha site, especially on S and W aspects. Fire dates frequently coincided with fire dates measured at study sites at lower elevation, suggesting that pre- 1880 fire sizes may have been very large. Large fires, those scarring 25 % {{or more of the}} sample trees, were relatively infrequent, averaging 31 years between burns. Four of the five major regional fire years occurred in the 1700 s, followed by a 94 -year gap until 1879. Fires typically occurred in significantly dry years (Palmer Drought Stress Index), with severe drought in major regional fire years. Currently the forest is predominantly spruce-fir, mixed conifer, and aspen. In contrast, den-droecological reconstruction of past forest structure showed that the forest in 1880 was very open, corresponding closely with historical (1910) accounts of severe fires leaving partially denuded landscapes.

30|$|Partial cross {{sections}} were {{cut with a}} chainsaw from all fire-scarred snags, downed logs, and live trees with visible <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> within the four <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> sampling areas. In some cases, several cuts were needed to obtain a sample with a maximum number of <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> and a minimum of rotted wood. Live trees were not sampled more than twice and were sampled conservatively to reduce the probability of mechanical failure (Heyerdahl and McKay 2001, Stephens 2001). Each fire-scarred sample was sanded with a belt sander using a series of belts up to 400 grit. <b>Fire</b> <b>scars</b> were identified by the characteristic disruption and healing patterns of radial tree ring growth (McBride 1983).|$|R
40|$|Disturbance events, such as fire, have a {{major impact}} on boreal forest dynamics, succession, and the global carbon cycle. Methods using {{satellite}} imagery are well established for detecting forest fires in real time and mapping the burned area (<b>fire</b> <b>scars)</b> within one year of the fire. This paper focuses on the detection of older fire disturbance–regeneration patterns in the boreal forests of Canada. Previous work found that shortwave-infrared image segmentation proved particularly good at creating uniform regions that were easy to associate with <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> Our findings suggest it is possible to detect <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> up to ten years old using SPOT-VEGETATION data from a single year and that the use of a vegetation index based on near- and shortwave-infrared reflectance is critical to this success. We demonstrate how the use of short-term multitemporal imagery can enhance segmentation results and present a threshold-based procedure for a posteriori identification of <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> segments. The resulting <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> probability map showed a good correspondence with records of <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> mapped by the Canadian Forest Service for 1980 – 1992 and “hot spots” from the FireM 3 Information System for 1994 – 1998...|$|R

Pairwise comparisons for differences among AOI median area were conducted using Mann-Whitney U test. The null hypothesis in all cases was that of no difference among AOIs. Areas for <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> in ENP were obtained from the fire management database, whereas <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> areas for the WCAs were computed from their hand-digitized polygons. The database contains <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> that are too small to locate in 30 m resolution imagery. To eliminate this bias in our area comparisons, ENP fires smaller than the smallest fire detected by visual examination in the WCAs (1.6 ha) were removed prior to analysis.|$|R
30|$|To {{determine}} the fire return interval (FRI), annual rings between successive <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> were counted for each sample. Some areas between <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> were excessively burned and this probably eliminated some <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> These intervals {{were excluded from}} point and site FRI estimates (non-recording years). The position within the ring in which a scar occurred was noted as EE (early earlywood), ME (middle earlywood), LE (late earlywood), LW (latewood), D (dormant), or U (undetermined) {{to serve as an}} estimate of the season of fire occurrence (Ahlstrand 1980, Dieterich and Swetnam 1984).|$|R
30|$|Each {{sample was}} {{progressively}} sanded with finer sandpaper, ending with 400 grit, to distinguish tree rings and <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>scars</b> {{were identified by}} the disruption and healing pattern of tree ring growth associated with the injury (McBride 1983).

40|$|Abstract. The spectral, {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} characteristics of the Landsat data record make it appropriate for mapping <b>fire</b> <b>scars.</b> Twenty-two annual <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> maps from 1972 – 2002 were produced from historical Landsat imagery for a semi-arid savannah landscape on the South Africa–Botswana border, centred over Madikwe Game Reserve (MGR) in South Africa.

30|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>scars</b> are {{a primary}} source of {{information}} for documenting the historic fire regimes. Several studies in Yosemite have determined that fires were frequent {{in the past but}} decreased sharply after the mid- 1800 s, coinciding with Euro-American settlement of the Yosemite region. Swetnam (1993) reported <b>fire</b> <b>scar</b> records in five giant sequoia groves located from Yosemite to Sequoia National Park that confirmed the presence of fire in the Sierra Nevada for the past 3, 000 years. Between 1300 and the mid- 1800 s, intervals free of <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> ranged from less than 13 yr during dry periods to between 15 yr and 30 yr during cool periods. Swetnam et al.

They found that mean fire return intervals for fires recorded by 25 % or more of the fire-scarred trees ranged from 4.94 yr in ponderosa pine at the lowest elevation to 10.57 yr in Jeffrey pine at the highest. Swetnam et al. (2000) also found that 55 % of the <b>fire</b> <b>scars</b> occurred in the latewood part of the tree ring, indicating that these fires burned between July and early October.
