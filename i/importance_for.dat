40|$|This paper {{develops}} importance resampling into a variance reduction {{technique for}} Monte Carlo integration. Importance resampling is a sample generation technique {{that can be}} used to generate more equally weighted samples <b>for</b> <b>importance</b> sampling. This can lead to significant variance reduction over standard <b>importance</b> sampling <b>for</b> common rendering problems. We show how to select the <b>importance</b> resampling parameters <b>for</b> near optimal variance reduction. We demonstrate the robustness of this technique on common global illumination problems and achieve a 10 %- 70 % variance reduction over standard <b>importance</b> sampling <b>for</b> direct lighting. We conclude that further variance reduction could be achieved with cheaper sampling methods.

The creative industry workforce is 3.1% of total employment in the European Union (EU), which creates a revenue that is 2.6% of the EU gross value.

Noether united these results and gave the first general representation theory of groups and algebras.
