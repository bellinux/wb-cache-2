25|$|Manyonga {{was raised}} in Mbekweni {{township}} in Paarl, a city in the far south-west of South Africa. His father, John, a <b>fork-lift</b> truck driver, was largely absent, leaving Manyonga to be raised by his mother, Joyce, a domestic cleaner. Given his surroundings, Manyonga had a poverty-stricken and dysfunctional upbringing, though his mother maintained the family home {{for him and his}} older brother and sister. He took part in local track and field competitions and his talent for long jump was soon identified. A local coach, Mario Smith, was surprised by the young man's ability and immediately set about supporting Manyonga towards a professional career.|$|E

500|$|One week of filming was {{conducted}} primarily {{at the old}} DuPont site in Pontypool which provided the sets for Deck 31—Capricorn's refuge and command centre, Much of the old extrusion machinery still in situ and their corresponding control [...] "Thorn Drive" [...] panels —and the various stairwells and corridors of the ship. Scenes on Deck 31 were filmed on 19 and 20 July. A double, Danielle de Costa, operated the <b>fork-lift</b> truck because Minogue didn't have the required license. Shooting was staggered {{as a result of}} Tennant's departure: 21 July focused on the supporting characters; and 23 July focused on Tennant. The aftermath of the meteor strike was filmed between 25 July and 27 July.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{primarily}} written by Russell T Davies after Minogue was cast. Davies described his pitch to Minogue as [...] "busking". The character of Astrid Peth {{was written for}} Minogue. Davies later stated that Minogue was a [...] "very exceptional case"; he considered writing a role specifically for one actor [...] "dangerous territory" [...] because the desired actor may be unavailable or decline the part. In early drafts of the episode, Astrid did not die. Davies decided Astrid's death was necessary to allow Minogue focus on her musical career. Davies described the original nature of her death—falling over a precipice during a fight with Capricorn—as [...] "fleeting". He intensified the scene by changing Max from mobile to cybernetic and Astrid's attack from an altercation to a <b>fork-lift</b> truck.

50|$|A Fork lift can be {{arranged}} {{in more ways than}} an L-shaped conveyor or a platform lift and a spiral conveyor. A <b>fork-lift</b> is a product lift which lifts products from a conveyor using a fork and then places them at a different level on another conveyor. Such a <b>fork-lift</b> makes it possible to introduce or remove products at an angle of 90 degrees. As a result, the number of possible input and output combinations is somewhat larger. Because of the possibility of sliding conveyors in or out of the lift, a <b>fork-lift</b> can also be used as a vertical sorting system. With such a sorting installation, a product can be entered and removed at any level and a product can be lifted and lowered using one lift. The power and thus the energy consumption of the drive is considerably lower with a <b>fork-lift</b> than with other systems, since only the product weight needs to be transported and the forks maintain a balance between each other in the rising and lowering section. Another difference between a <b>fork-lift</b> and an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift is the complexity of the control. With an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift, input and output must be completely synchronous, whereas this is not necessary with a <b>fork-lift.</b> This ensures considerably simpler controls.|$|E

50|$|When the country's {{manufacturers}} {{began to}} ramp up for World War II, Baker-Raulang {{was one of a}} handful of firms that produced electric industrial trucks and <b>fork-lifts.</b> In 1940 alone, more electric industrial trucks were ordered by the government than had been produced since their introduction in the teens. Critical shortages of copper combined with a lack of manufacturing capacity led Baker-Raulang (and the government) to the realization that gasoline powered truck and forklifts were the answer. Baker-Raulang produced as many electric and gasoline-powered vehicles as possible and helped regional automobile manufacturers re-tool in order to produce enough gasoline-powered fork lifts and bomb handling equipment to meet the Government's requirements.|$|R
50|$|Following the war, Baker-Raulang {{found the}} market for their fork lifts and {{industrial}} trucks was strong, but unfortunately by helping other manufacturers produce industrial trucks for the war effort, they had unwittingly created competition where it had not existed previously. Additionally, too much of their products were custom-made for customers with peculiar handling problems, which {{put them in a}} weak position to compete with their mass-produced competition. However, by 1947 a number of new mass-produced electric and gasoline-powered <b>fork-lifts</b> and yard trucks were put into production, and a year later demand was so high that they decided to move their industrial truck manufacturing operations to their West 80th St. plant, which formerly made truck bodies. By 1950, a new addition to the West 80th St. plant had been completed and the original West 25th St factory was sold.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a proposed integrated Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type Fuzzy Logic control (TSK-FLC) with Antiwindup elements for a forkloader position {{control of a}} Mini Heavy Loaded Forklift Autonomous Guided Vehicle (MHeLFAGV). The study {{was carried out by}} modeling TSK-FLC as a close-loop control for the each axis of the <b>fork-lift’s</b> movement. The degree of membership is designed with reference to the system response, in which ultrasonic sensor with 1 cm resolution is used. Moreover, the rule base is determined and optimized to deal with microcontroller processing speed. In order to cater for the windup phenomenon, a proportional and integrated antiwindup elements are integrated into the TSK-FLC model. This control strategy consumes less memory and is expected to increase the time response of the control system. The experiment and analysis is done on the actual forkloader unit of MHeLFAGV system. The experiment was done on the vertical axis motion since horizontal motion will have the same characteristic pattern of implementation and characteristic of tuning. The experiment shows that the proposed integrated TSK-FLC with antiwindup elements is able to speed up the time response of the system and eliminate the overshoot as well as oscillation on the forkloader movement...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{methanol}} {{fuel cells}} (DMFCs) generate electrical energy from an electro-chemical reaction between methanol and {{oxygen in the}} presence of a platinum containing electro-catalyst. They normally have the following components: (a) the anode gas channel, (b) the anode backing layer (that distributes liquid methanol and water from the anode gas channel to the anode catalyst layer), (c) the anode catalyst layer (that performs the reaction, CH 3 OH + 2 H 2 O = CO 2 + 6 H+ + 6 e -), (d) the electrolyte layer (that transports H+ from the anode catalyst layer to the cathode catalyst layer), (e) the cathode catalyst layer (that performs the reaction 32 O 2 + 6 H+ + 6 e- = 3 H 2 O, (f) the cathode backing layer (that distributes oxygen from the cathode gas channel to the cathode catalyst layer and transports water formed in the cathode catalyst layer to the cathode gas channel), and (g) the cathode gas channel. The direct methanol fuel cell being modeled in this project is being developed primarily for low power applications (lap-tops, PDA's) and to a lesser extent for transportation applications (automobiles, <b>fork-lifts).</b> A major problem in DMFC's is methanol crossover from the anode to the cathode without any electrochemical reaction.

40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to whole-body vibration has {{been pointed out}} {{as one of the}} major occupational risk factors in workplaces where vehicles are used by the workers. In some electrical <b>fork-lifts</b> vehicles, such as those generally called stackers, operators are requested to operate the vehicle in the upright position. Vibration exposure in this type of vehicles is rarely documented. Besides, stackers present some characteristics that could be potentially inadequate regarding operators’ ergonomics. Due to the electrical powered motors, these vehicles can be operated with fast and sudden movements. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize vibration exposure within these vehicles and to analyse the vibration exposure associated with the operation of these vehicles and to understand how individual characteristics, such as weight, age, experience, training and dexterity, can affect stacker vibration exposure levels. Vibration measurements were conducted considering a pre-defined task and a sample of 10 operators working with two different models of electrical stackers. In order to assess operators’ postures, as well as other individual variables, an individual questionnaire was undertaken. The results obtained seem to indicate that the dexterity and experience in driving such vehicles increase the vibration exposure levels. Besides, handling of this type of vehicle frequently forces the operator to adopt inadequate postures, because the stacker is often driven in a standing up position. One of those postures is the rotation of the torso, which, coupled with whole-body vibration exposure, may result in an increased risk of lumbar and back musculoskeletal disorders...|$|R
40|$|In modern storing {{technology}} High-Bay Warehouses are {{of great}} importance due to their large capacity by combining relatively small floor area with random access on all units, a large band-width with respect to weight and measurement of the storage good and the simplicity of integration in the logistical peripheries. The storage and retrieval operations are usually performed by automated rail-bound storage at retrieval machines, or types of manual floor-travelling <b>fork-lifts</b> for High-Bay Warehouses. Particularly by automated high-bay warehouse systems, {{a high degree of}} positioning accuracy is a basic requirement for sufficient reliability. The aim of this work is to investigate the essential elements required for improving the positional accuracy with reference to the various influential parameters. The influential parameters are wearout, tolerance, static and dynamic deformation of the storage and retrieval machine, as well as the tolerance and static deformations of the rack structure or travel and guide rails. Another basic parameter is the positional aberation at the centring location. To study the qualities of positioning systems, an experimental model was conceived and constructed allowing the emulation of the vibration of the wing unit of storage and retrieval machines. Theoretical calculations as well as the experimental results show that both the vibration level of the column of signle mast machines and the vertical vibrations of the lifting carriage can be simulated with adequate precision. Various arrangements of positioning systems were compared with respect to the expected qualities. One arrangement based upon a laser positional transducer was chosen, built, and investigated {{with the help of the}} developed experimental model. A high positioning accuracy of this positioning system was verified-which was almost independent of all the enumerated influential parameters. (orig.)
