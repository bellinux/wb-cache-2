30|$|From Table  2, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} the {{conventional}} TMR and QMR systems feature high FOM than the other TMR and QMR system implementations. This is expected because the basic TMR and QMR systems feature only the function modules and the majority voters, while TMR_WV, TMR_SHM and QMR_SHM incorporate extra error signalling logic or the proposed system <b>health</b> <b>monitor.</b> More logic implies more area and consequently more power dissipation, and is found to be the cause for more propagation delay as well. Compared to TMR_WV, the proposed TMR_SHM exhibits a 22.6  % reduction in FOM; nevertheless, the proposed system <b>health</b> <b>monitor</b> is more advanced, robust, and can provide an early fault warning signal compared to the TMR_WV which embeds only the error signalling logic. Also, the proposed system <b>health</b> <b>monitor</b> is generic and can be tailored to suit any NMR system. In comparison with the basic QMR system, the QMR_SHM reports less FOM by 2.7 ×.|$|R

25|$|Due to data {{transmission}} problems, structural <b>health</b> <b>monitoring</b> of wind turbines is usually performed using several accelerometers and strain gages {{attached to the}} nacelle to monitor the gearbox and equipments. Currently, digital image correlation and stereophotogrammetry are used to measure dynamics of wind turbine blades. These methods usually measure displacement and strain to identify location of defects. Dynamic characteristics of non-rotating wind turbines have been measured using digital image correlation and photogrammetry. Three dimensional point tracking has also been used to measure rotating dynamics of wind turbines.|$|E

40|$|Background: Health equity is a {{priority}} in the post- 2015 sustainable development agenda and other major health initiatives. The World Health Organization (WHO) {{has a history of}} promoting actions to achieve equity in health, including efforts to encourage the practice of <b>health</b> inequality <b>monitoring.</b> <b>Health</b> inequality <b>monitoring</b> systems use disaggregated data to identify disadvantaged subgroups within populations and inform equity-oriented health policies, programs, and practices. Objective: This paper provides an overview of a number of recent and current WHO initiatives related to <b>health</b> inequality <b>monitoring</b> at the global and/or national level. Design: We outline the scope, content, and intended uses/application of the following: <b>Health</b> Equity <b>Monitor</b> database and theme page; State of inequality: reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health report; Handbook on health inequality monitoring: with a focus on low- and middle-income countries; <b>Health</b> inequality <b>monitoring</b> eLearning module; <b>Monitoring</b> <b>health</b> inequality: an essential step for achieving health equity advocacy booklet and accompanying video series; and capacity building workshops conducted in WHO Member States and Regions. Conclusions: The paper concludes by considering how the work of the WHO can be expanded upon to promote the establishment of sustainable and robust inequality monitoring systems across a variety of health topics among Member States and at the global level...|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} system <b>health</b> <b>monitor</b> produces two outputs: EFW, {{corresponding to}} the early fault warning logic; and ERROR, which corresponds to the error signalling logic. Let us first discuss {{the operation of the}} fault warning logic, followed by a discussion of the error signalling logic.|$|R
30|$|Referring to {{the chart}} shown in Fig.  7, {{it can be}} seen that the {{function}} modules dissipate extra power in the case of TMR_WV, TMR_SHM and QMR_SHM compared to those of their traditional TMR and QMR system counterparts. This is because in case of the latter, the function modules outputs are solely processed by the majority voters, while in the case of the former, the function modules outputs are additionally processed by the error signalling logic or the system <b>health</b> <b>monitor</b> and hence extra power is dissipated. Of the total power dissipated by the TMR_SHM, the proportion of power dissipated by the proposed system <b>health</b> <b>monitor</b> is 20.8  %. In the case of QMR_SHM, this proportion is found to be 27  %.|$|R

25|$|Given the well-recognized role of {{cholesterol}} in cardiovascular disease, {{some studies have}} shown an inverse correlation between cholesterol levels and mortality. A 2009 study of patients with acute coronary syndromes found an association of hypercholesterolemia with better mortality outcomes. In the Framingham Heart Study, in subjects over 50 years of age, they found an 11% increase overall and 14% increase in cardiovascular disease mortality per 1mg/dL per year drop in total cholesterol levels. The researchers attributed this phenomenon {{to the fact that}} people with severe chronic diseases or cancer tend to have below-normal cholesterol levels. This explanation is not supported by the Vorarlberg <b>Health</b> <b>Monitoring</b> and Promotion Programme, in which men of all ages and women over 50 with very low cholesterol were likely to die of cancer, liver diseases, and mental diseases. This result indicates the low-cholesterol effect occurs even among younger respondents, contradicting the previous assessment among cohorts of older people that this is a proxy or marker for frailty occurring with age.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the usage of}} IDDX monitors, which provide (periodic) data to be employed for predicting the remaining lifetime of processor cores in homogeneous multi-processor SoCs during their lifetime. This forms the basis of self-repair with no mean down time for these SoCs and dramatically improving their dependability. We accomplish this goal by optimally choosing and combining our designed <b>health</b> <b>monitors,</b> such as delay and current monitors to provide non-redundant measurement data. These can be implemented nowadays as IJATG-compatible embedded instruments. Accelerated stress tests were carried out using a set of processor cores in combination {{with a number of}} <b>health</b> <b>monitors</b> providing historic data. These results form the basis of a remaining lifetime prediction model for delay (processor clock frequency), where the coefficients are determined by a genetic algorithm. After the final test of an individual SoC, these stored coefficients can be periodically updated in an embedded processor during its lifetime by the <b>health</b> <b>monitors.</b> In the case of seriously degrading cores, counteractions are automatically taken, like core isolation and (e. g. spare) replacement. In this case, use is made of advanced run-time mapping software. The result is a zero mean downtime SoC with 40 % reliability improvement in our 9 processor-core SoC...|$|R

40|$|The IEEE 1687 (IJTAG) is a newly IEEE {{approved}} standard to access embedded instruments. The usage of these embedded instruments (<b>health</b> <b>monitors)</b> is increasing {{in order to}} perform different online measurements for testing purposes as dependability is becoming a key concern in today’s electronics. Aging and intermittent resistive faults (IRF) are two threats to a highly dependable system, and temperature can accelerate these two phenomena.

Three temperature monitors along with an IJTAG controller are used to demonstrate online temperature measurements using an IJTAG network interface.

40|$|This paper aims at {{articulating}} {{a conceptual}} framework for <b>monitoring</b> equity in <b>health</b> and healthcare. The focus is on four main questions: What is health equity?

40|$|A new {{generation}} of highly dependable multi- processor Systems-on-Chip for safety-critical applications under harsh environments with zero down-time is emerging. In this paper 1, the approach towards reaching this ultimate goal is explained.

The focus will be here on processor cores, with delay {{as one of the}} most critical aging dependent parameters. An extensive (accelerated) -test program was set-up to evaluate the aging of both the <b>health</b> <b>monitors</b> as well as delay of an industrial reconfigurable processor core in harsh environments.
