He hired William C. Glass to assist Henry Eitel in {{managing}} his affairs. While Eitel handled the finances, Glass worked to organize his lecture tours. Glass worked closely with Riley's publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books, and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation. He was careful not to book busy schedules; Riley only performed <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> and the tours were short, lasting only three months.|$|E

5|$|In 1828, Heliade {{published}} his first work, {{an essay on}} Romanian grammar, in the Transylvanian city of Hermannstadt (which {{was part of the}} Austrian Empire at the time), and, on April 20, 1829, began printing the Bucharest-based paper Curierul Românesc. This was the most successful of several attempts to create a local newspaper, something Golescu first attempted in 1828. Publishing articles in both Romanian and French, Curierul Românesc had, starting in 1836, its own literary supplement, under the title of Curier de Ambe Sexe; in print until 1847, it notably published one of Heliade's most famous poems, Zburătorul. Curierul Românesc was edited as a weekly, and later as a bimonthly, until 1839, when it began to be issued three or <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Its best-known contributors were Heliade himself, Grigore Alexandrescu, Costache Negruzzi, Dimitrie Bolintineanu, Ioan Catina, Vasile Cârlova, and Iancu Văcărescu.|$|E

The production was staged at the 2660-seat Stoll Theatre in Kingsway, London at Christmas. Its popularity resulted in the show running during the Christmas season {{for five or six}} years. Blyton was delighted with its reception by children in the audience, and attended the theatre three or <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> TV adaptations of Noddy since 1954 include one in the 1970s narrated by Richard Briers.

40|$|Abstract Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of a {{laughter}} therapy on depression, of elderly. Methods: A quasi-experimental, nonequivalent control group pretest posttest design was used. Participants (n= 38) included elders. Data were collected from October 1 to 22, 2013. Experimental group (n= 19) participated in laughter therapy <b>four</b> <b>times,</b> once <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for 50 min per session. Questionnaires were used to measure pretest and posttest levels of depression. Results: At the end of four-week intervention, depression score (z=- 2. 59, p =. 017) was significantly decreased in the experimental group compared to control group. Conclusion: The study results suggest that the laughter therapy is an effective intervention to reduce the depression. It seems that this program can widely be utilized as one of nursing intervention programs for the elderly...|$|R

N-nitrosobis(2 -oxopropyl) amine (BOP) induces pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas limited to Syrian golden hamsters, other rodents not being susceptible.
