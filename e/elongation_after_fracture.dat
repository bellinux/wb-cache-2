The aim of our work was to study the sequence of gene expression events involved in inflammation and bone remodeling occurring in the early phases of callus formation in osteoporotic patients. Methodology/Principal Findings: Fifty-six patients submitted to hip replacement surgery after a low-energy hip fracture were enrolled in this study. The patients were grouped according to the time interval between fracture and surgery: bone collected within 3 days <b>after</b> <b>fracture</b> (n = 13); between the 4 th and 7 th day (n = 33); and after one week from the fracture (n = 10).

Closed, semistabilized transverse fractures were created in the tibias of wildtype (WT) and TSP 2 -null mice. The fractures were examined 5, 10, and 20 days <b>after</b> <b>fracture</b> using mCT, histology, immunohistochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR, and torsional mechanical testing. Ten days <b>after</b> <b>fracture,</b> TSP 2 -null mice showed 30 % more bone by mCT and 40 % less cartilage by histology.

40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this work is to study the {{influence}} of copper content (Cu) in machining of 6351 aluminum alloy (Al-Si-Mg). The machinability was evaluated from measurements of drilling torque and drilling thrust force in cutting tool and surface roughness of the machined surface during drilling process. Samples of 6351 aluminum alloy were produced with different levels of copper (Cu) (0. 07, 0. 23, 0. 94, 1. 43 and 1. 93 %). Cutting speed and feed rate were varied in five levels (60 to 100 m/min and 0. 1 to 0. 3 mm/rev). The results showed that increasing the copper content in a Al-Si-Mg-Cu aluminum alloy increase the precipitation hardening through the stabilization of hardening phases like Al 5 Cu 2 Mg 8 Si 6 and Al 2 Cu, also the increase in amount of Al 2 Cu. Thus, the samples of 6351 aluminum alloy with higher copper content, in general, showed higher hardness and ultimate tensile strength values, while the percentage <b>elongation</b> <b>after</b> <b>fracture</b> was lower. The drilling torque and drilling thrust force during drilling process increased almost linearly with feed rate increase.

Based on the similarity between Mg 2 Si and Si phases in crystalline structure and crystallization process, {{the present study investigated}} the effects of different concentrations of Bi on the microstructure, tensile properties, and fracture behavior of cast Al- 15 wt. %Mg 2 Si in-situ metal matrix composite. The results show that the addition of the proper amount of Bi has a significant modification effect on both primary and eutectic Mg 2 Si in the Al- 15 wt. %Mg 2 Si composite. With an increase in Bi content from 0 to 1 wt. %, the morphology of the primary Mg 2 Si is changed from irregular or dendritic to polyhedral shape; and its average particle size is significantly decreased from 70 to 6 μm. Moreover, the morphology of the eutectic Mg 2 Si phase is altered from flake-like to very short fibrous or dot-like. When the Bi addition exceeds 4. 0 wt. %, the primary Mg 2 Si becomes coarse again. However, the eutectic Mg 2 Si still exhibits the modified morphology. Tensile tests reveal that the Bi addition can improve the tensile strength and ductility of the material. Compared with those of the unmodified composite, the ultimate tensile strength and percentage <b>elongation</b> <b>after</b> <b>fracture</b> with 1. 0 wt. % Bi increase 51. 2 % and 100 %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. Steels with carbide free {{bainitic}} (CFB) microstructures show excellent strength, toughness {{and wear}} resistance. Cast or wrought products produced by conventional metallurgy have become introduced in manufacturing of machine components. The required silicon addition {{of more than}} 1. 5 wt % in CFB-steels limits the possibilities to produce components by P/M methods. The aim of this work has been to investigate the possibilites to produce CFB-steels by pressing and sintering. Four different powder mixtures based on Distaloy DC powder have been pressed to a relative density of 90 % and sintered in a N 2 -H 2 atmosphere at 1150 oC. The sintered components were austenitized followed by austempering above the martensite start temperature. Tensile and impact testing together with microhardness measurements have been performed. The microstructures were studied by optical microscopy as well as SEM and XRD-methods. The tensile strength values achieved varied from 313 to 737 MPa, the <b>elongation</b> <b>after</b> <b>fracture</b> were between 0. 1 and 0. 2 %. The impact toughness values varied between 4 and 11 J. The hardness of the bainite after short sintering time varied between 630 and 710 HV and the hardness of the CFB was 350 HV after short sintering time but reached 573 after prolonged sintering. The microstructure consisted mainly of bainite, small amount of CFB mixed with austenite but also of ferrite and retained austenite after short sintering time. A longer sintering time created a structure consisting of mainly CFB with bainite and {{a small amount of}} ferrite. The most interesting applications for P/M produced CFB-containing steels should be components subjected to sliding or rolling-sliding wear loads, as gears. The hardness and strength values achieved in the present work indicate that P/M produced CFB-steels can prove superior to conventional P/M steels in many applications...|$|E

The peak level of cell proliferation as revealed by PCNA labelling appeared first in primitive mesenchymal cells and inflammatory cells at the fracture edges and neighboring periosteum at 2 -days <b>after</b> <b>fracture,</b> {{followed by the}} peaks of periosteal primitive fibroblasts and chondroblasts, which appeared at fracture edges at 3 - and 4 -days <b>after</b> <b>fracture,</b> respectively. BMP 2 was weakly positive in primitive mesenchymal cells, osteoblasts and chondroblasts. At 3 -days post-fracture, periosteal osteoblasts produced osteoid tissue and callus with marrow spaces lined by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and all primitive mesenchymal cells and osteoblasts were positive for TGF-b 1,- 2,- 3, and TGF-b R 1,-R 2. They were also positive for vascular growth factors bFGF, FGFR and PDGF, but negative for VEGF, and the peak of PCNA labelling of vascular endothelial cells in the marrow space was delayed to 4 -days <b>after</b> <b>fracture.</b> Chondroblasts at fracture edges produced hypertrophic chondrocytes at 5 -days <b>after</b> <b>fracture</b> and they were positive for TGF-b 1,- 2,- 3, and TGF-b R 1,-R 2.

40|$|Structural {{steel grades}} with yield {{strength}} higher than 420 MPa are considered as high strength steels. They undoubtedly have lower ductility than mild steels {{in terms of}} engineering measures of ductility, such as ultimate-to-yield strength ratio, uniform strain and elongation at fracture. A typical values for high strength steels are: ultimate-to-yield strength ratio fu/fy = 1, 05, uniform strain εu = 0, 05 and <b>elongation</b> <b>after</b> <b>fracture</b> εfr = 15 %. The problem is that inelastic behaviour is hidden in numerous nominally elastic resistances checks of steel structures and therefore sufficient local ductility has to be assured. The focus is set on structural elements with holes subjected to tension and to tension splices with bolts in shear. Local ductility in terms of plastic deformations has to be sufficient in order to assure bolthole elongation, so the loading transfers through all bolts. An extensive experimental research of plates with holes and tension splices made of steel grade S 690 was conducted to determine maximum resistance and ductility. The reliability of the Eurocode design rules for net cross- section resistance to was statistically evaluated. The statistical analysis was substantiated by additional test results on net cross-section failure of high strength steel members available in literature. Moreover, the experiments were numerically simulated to look inside the stress state. The test results served as a guideline for the accuracy of numerical simulations.

Results For all of the genes studied, the mRNA levels increased in both age groups to a peak at one to two weeks <b>after</b> <b>fracture.</b> All gene expression levels decreased to very low or undetectable levels at four and six weeks <b>after</b> <b>fracture</b> for both age groups.

Although mature bone and cartilage is minimal 5 days <b>after</b> <b>fracture,</b> TSP 2 -null mice had reduced expression of collagen IIa and Sox 9 (chondrocyte differentiation markers) but increased expression of osteocalcin and osterix (osteoblast differentiation markers). Importantly, TSP 2 -null mice had a 2 -fold increase in vessel density that corresponded with a reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Glut- 1 (markers of hypoxia inducible factor [HIF]-regulated transcription). Finally, by expressing TSP 2 using adenovirus starting 3 days <b>after</b> <b>fracture,</b> chondrogenesis was restored in TSP 2 -null mice. We hypothesize that TSP 2 expressed by cells in the fracture mesenchyme regulates callus vascularization. The increase in vascularity increases tissue oxemia and decreases HIF; thus, undifferentiated cells in the callus develop into osteoblasts rather than chondrocytes. This leads to an alternative strategy for achieving fracture healing with reduced endochondral ossification and enhanced appositional bone formation.
