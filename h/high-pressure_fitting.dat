40|$|Safety {{restraint}} protects {{people and}} property if a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>fitting</b> fails. As long as pressure line remains attached at the fitting, clamp exerts essentially no force on hose. If fitting fails, force of fluid leaving free end of hose causes the cam on the clamp to compress hose {{with a positive}} locking action...|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} apparatus {{has been}} devised {{as a means}} of studying plausible biogeochemical reactions under high-pressure, low-temperature aqueous, anaerobic conditions like those conjectured to prevail in a liquid water ocean on Europa (the fourth largest moon of the planet Jupiter). The experiments to be performed by use of this apparatus are intended to enhance understanding of how life (if any) could originate and evolve in the Europa ocean environment. Inasmuch as terrestrial barophilic, psychrophilic organisms that thrive under anaerobic conditions are used in the experiments, the experiments may also contribute to terrestrial biogeochemistry. The apparatus (see figure) includes a bolt-closure reaction vessel secured inside a refrigerator that maintains a temperature of 4 C. Pressurized water is supplied to the interior of the vessel by a hydrostatic pump, which is attached to the vessel via <b>high-pressure</b> <b>fittings.</b> The terrestrial organisms used in the experiments thus far have been several facultative barophilic, psychrophilic stains of Shewanella bacteria. In the experiments, these organisms have been tested for reduction of ferric ion by growing them {{in the presence of a}} ferric food source under optimized terrestrial conditions. The short-term goal of these experiments has been to select Shewanella strains that exhibit iron-reduction capability and test their ability to facilitate biogeochemical reduction of iron under temperature and pressure conditions imitating those in Europa s ocean. It is anticipated, that, once growth under Europa-like conditions has been achieved, the selected Shewanella strains will be used to facilitate biogeochemical reactions of sulfate and carbonate with hydrogen gas. Any disequilibrium of the products with the environment would be interpreted as signifying biogenic activity and the possibility of life in Europa s ocean...|$|R
40|$|Pressure-polishing is {{a method}} for shaping glass {{pipettes}} for patch-clamp recording. We first developed this method for fabricating pipettes suitable for recording from small (< 3 m) neuronal cell bodies. The basic principal is similar to glass-blowing and combines air pressure and heat to modify the shape of patch pipettes prepared by a conventional micropipette puller. It {{can be applied to}} so-called soft (soda lime) and hard (borosilicate) glasses. Generally speaking, pressure polishing can reduce pipette resistance by 25 % without decreasing the diameter of the tip opening (Goodman and Lockery, 2000). It can be applied to virtually any type of glass and requires only the addition of a <b>high-pressure</b> valve and <b>fitting</b> to a microforge. This technique is essential for recording from ultrasmall cells (< 5 m) and can also improve single-channel recording by minimizing pipette resistance. The blunt shape is also useful for perforated-patch clamp recording since this tip shape results in a larger membrane bleb available for perforation...|$|R
