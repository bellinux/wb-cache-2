5|$|Most of Caria {{surrendered}} to the Persians in aftermath of Lade, although some strongholds had to be captured through force. The Persian fleet and army wintered at Miletus, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp out the last embers of the revolt. They attacked and captured the islands of Chios, Lesbos and Tenedos and then moved over to the mainland, and captured each of the remaining cities of Ionia. Although the cities of Ionia were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of Miletus.

5|$|Although {{unknown to}} the Australians at the time, the earlier attack on Lang Phuoc Hai had been a {{deliberate}} attempt by the Viet Cong to provoke a reaction from 1 ATF. As such {{there would be no}} withdrawal on this occasion. Anticipating that any relief force would move by road, the Viet Cong had subsequently established an extensive ambush in the buildings alongside Route 44, which led into the village itself. Although the presence of this trap was not detected by the Australians, Murphy's evasion had ensured that his APCs had avoided it, moving the infantry by a cross-country route instead. However, with C Company delayed as a result, A Company made their airmobile assault onto an unsecured landing zone at 13:45, supported only by indirect fire from the artillery at Dat Do in suppression, which was initially limited due to delay in setting up the fire support base. Under the command of Major Owen O'Brien, A Company then began to advance into the fringe of thick rainforest to secure the southern edge of the landing zone for the arrival of B Company and the remainder of the battalion. <b>Finally,</b> <b>over</b> 30 minutes after the lead company had flown in, the APCs began to receive sniper fire as they neared the landing zone.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the success}} of these early efforts to {{establish}} professional status of midwives, midwifery failed to make a significant comeback.

25|$|Once {{the revolt}} proper had started, {{there were many}} further {{instances}} of clearing churches, some still unofficial and disorderly, but as cities became officially Protestant, increasingly undertaken by official order, like the Amsterdam Alteratie ("Alteration") of 1578. Altars, to which Calvinists, unlike Lutherans, took strong exception, were typically completely removed, and in some large churches, like Utrecht Cathedral, large tomb monuments put where they stood, partly to make their return more difficult if political conditions changed. After the Eighty Years War was <b>finally</b> <b>over,</b> in the cities and areas that became Protestant, the old Catholic churches were all or nearly all {{taken over by the}} new established church of the Calvinist Dutch Reformed Church, with other congregations left to shift for themselves.|$|E

25|$|With Luton's spell {{in the top}} flight <b>finally</b> <b>over,</b> it {{was always}} going to be {{difficult}} to keep hold of prize assets. So it proved when Mick Harford signed for Chelsea for £300,000. The first season in the new, three-division Football League almost saw Luton drop into the third tier of English football. The team was not helped by the involvement of Scottish duo Paul Telfer and Darren Salton in a motor accident early on in the season – under-21 international defender Salton was nearly killed, and never played again. Luton were bottom of the table shortly into the New Year, and Pleat reacted by procuring a loan deal to bring Luton-born England international Kerry Dixon to the club on loan from Southampton. Dixon gelled well alongside Phil Gray up front, and Luton stayed up.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the 10th century, the West Saxon kings {{extended}} their power first over Mercia, then into the southern Danelaw, and <b>finally</b> <b>over</b> Northumbria, thereby imposing a semblance of political unity on peoples, who nonetheless would remain conscious of their respective customs and their separate pasts. The prestige, and indeed the pretensions, of the monarchy increased, the institutions of government strengthened, and kings and their agents sought in various ways to establish social order. This process started with Edward the Elder – who with his sister, Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians, initially, charters reveal, encouraged people to purchase estates from the Danes, thereby to reassert some degree of English influence in territory which had fallen under Danish control. David Dumville suggests that Edward may have extended this policy by rewarding his supporters with grants of land in the territories newly conquered from the Danes, and that any charters issued in respect of such grants have not survived. When Athelflæd died, Mercia was absorbed by Wessex. From that point on there was no contest for the throne, so the house of Wessex became the ruling house of England.|$|E
25|$|Nothing more {{happened}} in the south, until Iraq liberated the Al-Faw Peninsula while also re-capturing all land lost in the central front. Iraq could attack Iranian oil platforms and oil tankers while their own oil was transported via Kuwait and other Arab countries. Iran got frustrated and started attacking Kuwait, and later any tanker from pro-Iraq Arab countries, which ended in the US starting Operation Earnest Will to protect the ships, Iran kept on attacking and, after a US ship was heavily damaged by an Iranian mine the US launched Operation Praying Mantis. In this operation they first destroyed 2 Iranian oil-platforms, followed by the largest naval battle since World War II. The Iranian navy lost a frigate, a gunboat and several speedboats during the battle. In the north Iran continued advancing and Saddam started gassing the Kurdish population. Following this Ayatollah Khomeini finally accepted peace. But by this time Saddam didn't want peace anymore and together with the MEK conducted a joint attack to capture the town of Mehran in the Iranian province of Ilam {{as well as providing}} air support for the MEK advance in the province of Kermanshah. Saddam came under heavy international pressure which prompted him to withdraw his troops back across the border from Mehran, leaving the MEK army in occupation of the town. However the Iranian armed forces were able to defeat the MEK army which was largely destroyed in Operation Mersad. Now Saddam also accepted peace and the 8-year war was <b>finally</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E

25|$|McNabb's 2005 {{season began}} with turmoil and ended {{on the injured}} reserve list. While not {{speaking}} with his main target, Terrell Owens, and all the distractions {{that came with the}} Owens controversy, McNabb was named the NFC's Player of the Month for September. That month, McNabb threw for 964 yards, eight touchdowns and only two interceptions in three games, leading the Eagles to a 2-1 record. McNabb carried that momentum into October as he went 33-for-48 (68.8 completion percentage), threw for 369 yards and three touchdowns en route to leading the Eagles to a memorable come-from-behind victory at an unfriendly Arrowhead Stadium against the Kansas City Chiefs. McNabb could not keep the momentum rolling, however, as the Eagles lost four straight games. Over that span, McNabb posted a quarterback rating higher than 72 only once, on November 6, at the Washington Redskins. After playing with a sports hernia and sore thumb, McNabb's season was <b>finally</b> <b>over</b> after a disastrous effort at home on November 14 on Monday night against the rival Dallas Cowboys. McNabb was intercepted by Roy Williams {{towards the end of the}} game, and tried to tackle the defender when Scott Shanle came in and tackled McNabb to the ground. McNabb had injured his groin on the play and was placed on the injured reserve list later that week. Mike McMahon replaced him at quarterback, and went 2–5 as a starter, with the Eagles finishing the season with a 6–10 record overall. Though low for his standards, McNabb put up respectable numbers in 2005. In nine games, he threw for 2,507 yards, 16 touchdowns and nine interceptions. To go along with that, he completed 59.1% (211-357) of his passes. Prior to his season-ending injury, McNabb was on pace to throw for 4,457 yards, which would have easily eclipsed his career high of 3,875, set in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Soon thereafter, however, Edward is {{rescued by}} Richard, Hastings and Stanley. News of the escape reaches Henry's court, {{and the young}} Earl of Richmond is sent into exile in France for safety. Richmond is a {{descendant}} of John of Gaunt, uncle of Richard II and son of Edward III, and therefore a potential Lancastrian heir should anything happen to Henry and his son; hence {{the need to protect}} him. Meanwhile, Edward reorganises his forces, and confronts Warwick's army. At the Battle of Barnet, George betrays Warwick, and rejoins the Yorkists. This throws Warwick's forces into disarray, and the Yorkists win the battle, during which both Warwick and Montague are killed. Oxford and the Duke of Somerset now assume command of the Lancastrian forces, and join a second battalion newly arrived from France led by Margaret and Prince Edward. Meanwhile, Henry sits on the molehill York was on and laments his problems. He is met by a father who has killed his son, and a son who has killed his father, representing the horrors of the civil war. Henry is captured by two gamekeepers loyal to Edward, and imprisoned in the Tower of London, while Edward goes to meet the Lancastrian/French force. In the subsequent Battle of Tewkesbury the Yorkists rout the Lancastrians, capturing Margaret, Prince Edward, Somerset and Oxford. Somerset is sentenced to death, Oxford to life imprisonment, Margaret is banished, and Prince Edward is stabbed to death by the three Plantagenet brothers, who fly into a rage after he refuses to recognise the House of York as the legitimate royal family. At this point, Richard goes to London to kill Henry. At Richard's arrival at the Tower, the two argue, and in a rage Richard stabs Henry. With his dying breath, Henry prophesies Richard's future villainy and the chaos that will engulf the country. Back at court, Edward is reunited with his queen and meets his infant son, who was born in sanctuary. Edward orders celebrations to begin, believing the civil wars are <b>finally</b> <b>over</b> and lasting peace is at hand. He is unaware, however, of Richard's scheming and his desire for power at any cost.|$|E
