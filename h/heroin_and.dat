5|$|A 1999–2005 Australian police {{survey of}} detainees {{reported}} preliminary findings that self-reported users of benzodiazepines {{were less likely}} than non-user detainees to work full-time {{and more likely to}} receive government benefits, use methamphetamine or <b>heroin,</b> <b>and</b> be arrested or imprisoned. Benzodiazepines are sometimes used for criminal purposes; they serve to incapacitate a victim in cases of drug assisted rape or robbery.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} cocaine <b>and</b> <b>heroin</b> prices <b>and</b> possession arrests on medical examiner mentions of cocaine <b>and</b> <b>heroin</b> in 37 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) over the 1990 - 1998 period. Using data from DAWN, STRIDE, Uniform Crime Reports, BEA, BLS, and the Census Bureau, OLS regression results show that without the inclusion of MSA dummies, there is a highly significant negative relationship between cocaine <b>and</b> <b>heroin</b> prices <b>and</b> mentions of both drugs. However, when MSA dummies are added, only cocaine prices have a significant negative relationship with cocaine <b>and</b> <b>heroin</b> mentions, while heroin prices are no longer significantly related with mentions of either type. Possession arrests rates do not significantly affect cocaine or heroin mentions regardless of whether MSA dummies are included...|$|R

5|$|Bufotenin, {{one of the}} {{chemicals}} excreted by the cane toad, is classified as a class-1 drug under Australian law, alongside <b>heroin</b> <b>and</b> cannabis. The effects of bufotenin {{are thought to be}} similar to those of mild poisoning; the stimulation, which includes mild hallucinations, lasts for less than an hour. As the cane toad excretes bufotenin in small amounts, and other toxins in relatively large quantities, toad licking could result in serious illness or death.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Dr. Dre and Jenita Porter had a son, Andre Young Jr. In 1990, Porter sued Dr. Dre in Orange County Superior Court seeking $5,000 {{of child}} support per month.

Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Reece {{recalled}} people queuing outside Piccadilly's branch of Boots for heroin pills in the late 1940s. By the 1960s, the street and surrounding area were notorious as the centre of London's illegal drug trade, where <b>heroin</b> <b>and</b> cocaine could be purchased on the black market from unscrupulous chemists. By 1982, up to 20 people could be seen queueing at a chemist dealing in illegal drugs in nearby Shaftesbury Avenue.|$|E

On April 25, 2009, it was announced that Alice in Chains had signed to Virgin/EMI making it the band's first label change in their 20-plus year career.

5|$|On June 19, 1969, Hendrix flew to Toronto for a {{preliminary}} hearing. He wore {{a business suit}} {{for the first time}} since before the formation of the Experience in late 1966. Judge Robert Taylor presided over the hearing, setting a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of possession of <b>heroin</b> <b>and</b> hashish, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. More serious potential charges of drug transporting and trafficking, which had been discussed at the time of the arrest, were not filed.|$|E

5|$|On June 30, 1975, {{four days}} after finalizing her divorce from Sonny, Cher married rock {{musician}} Gregg Allman, co-founder of The Allman Brothers Band. She filed for divorce nine days later because of his <b>heroin</b> <b>and</b> liquor problems, but they reconciled within a month. They had one son, Elijah Blue, on July 10, 1976. Sonny and Cher's TV reunion, The Sonny and Cher Show, debuted on CBS in February 1976—the first show ever to star a divorced couple. Although the show was a ratings success on its premiere, Cher and Sonny's insulting onscreen banter about their divorce, her reportedly extravagant lifestyle, and her troubled relationship with Allman caused a public backlash that eventually contributed to the show's cancellation in August 1977.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1969, customs {{agents at}} Toronto International Airport {{detained}} Hendrix after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be <b>heroin</b> <b>and</b> hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on $10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect.|$|E

Rainie leaves with the money without Tanya noticing but ignores the ultimatum, returning the following year. Tanya is in an emotional state, having recently split from her husband Max Branning (Jake Wood). Rainie returns the money to Tanya and says she is not using drugs, so Tanya allows her to stay but she tests positive for cannabis so Tanya asks her to leave.|$|E
40|$|Background: Cognitive deficits are {{observed}} both in <b>heroin</b> dependence <b>and</b> in pathological gambling (PG) on various tasks. PG, as a non-substance addiction, {{is free of}} toxic consequences of drug use. Therefore a direct neurocognitive comparison of <b>heroin</b> addicts <b>and</b> pathological gamblers helps dissociate the consequences of chronic heroin use on cognitive function from the cognitive vulnerabilities that predispose addiction...|$|R

5|$|The Red Hot Chili Peppers had {{released}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik in 1991. The {{album was}} an instant hit, selling over seven million copies in the United States, and turned the band into an international sensation. Guitarist John Frusciante was having difficulty coping with the band's newfound fame and started to dislike it. Frusciante often argued with his bandmates, and sabotaged performances. He began taking <b>heroin</b> <b>and</b> steadily increased his usage of the drug over time. Frusciante quit the band in 1992, during its Japanese leg of the tour. He returned {{to his home in}} California and became a recluse.|$|E

Richards was tried here again in 1973 for possession of <b>heroin</b> <b>and</b> owning unlicensed firearms, but was only fined £205 (now £). John Lennon and Yoko Ono were tried for obscenity here in 1970. The building became Grade II listed in 1970. The courts closed in 1998, and are now the Courthouse Hotel.|$|E
