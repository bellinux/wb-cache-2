However the design was seen to be worth pursuing because deuterium is abundant and uranium is scarce, and he had no idea how powerful the US design was. Sakharov realised that in order to cause the explosion of one side of the fuel to symmetrically compress the fusion fuel, a mirror could be used to reflect the radiation. The details had not been officially declassified in Russia when Sakharov was writing his memoirs, but in the Teller-Ulam design, soft X-rays emitted by the fission bomb were focused onto a cylinder of lithium deuteride to compress it symmetrically. This is called radiation implosion. The Teller-Ulam design also had a secondary fission device inside the fusion cylinder to assist with the compression of the fusion fuel and generate neutrons to convert some of the lithium to tritium, producing a mixture of deuterium and tritium. Sakharov's idea was first tested as RDS-37 in 1955.

40|$|As {{a test of}} {{the linear}} binary {{collision}} cascade model for ion-solid interaction, theoretical models of D-D fusion induced by heavy ion irradiation of titanium deuteride are compared with experimental results. Thin-film titanium deuteride samples of composition TiD 1. 7 were prepared by heating 320 nm titanium films on silicon dioxide in a static pressure of deuterium. The deuterium content of these films was inferred from changes in the titanium and oxygen contaminant signals measured by 3. 05 MeV oxygen-resonance backscattering spectrometry. The titanium deuteride samples were irradiated with beams of argon and xenon ions with energies ranging from 140 to 600 keV. The energy of the incident ion was transferred to atoms in the sample through a series of nuclear collisions, resulting in deuteron-deuteron collisions with energies up to tens of keV. The cross sections for D-D fusion at these energies are large enough for fusion events to be detected for doses above 10 14 ions. A silicon surface-barrier detector placed at an angle of 130 ° with respect to the incident ion beam was used to monitor the 3. 02 MeV protons and 1. 01 MeV tritons from the D(d,p) T reaction and 0. 82 MeV 3 He ions from the D(d,n) 3 He reaction. Fusion yields (fusion events per incident ion) ranging from 10 - 14 to 10 - 10 were measured. A linear binary collision cascade model is presented which predicts fusion yields which are in excellent agreement with the measured yields for all cases studied. The model predicts a distribution of deuteron-deuteron center-of-mass velocities which causes a distribution of Doppler shifts in the spectrum of the fusion products. The shape of the theoretical proton signals based on the model is a reasonably good fit to the experimental proton signals.

Biological samples are usually dissolved in water, so their hydrogens are able to exchange with any deuteriums in the solvent. Since the overall scatter of a molecule depends on the scatter of all its components, this will depend on the ratio of hydrogen to deuterium in the molecule. At certain ratios of H2O to D2O, called match points, the scatter from the molecule will equal that of the solvent, and thus be eliminated when the scatter from the buffer is subtracted from the data. For instance the match point for proteins is typically around 40-45% D2O, and at that concentration the scatter from the protein will be indistinguishable from that of the buffer.|$|E

The highest and lowest 13 C and 2 H (or D, <b>deuterium)</b> <b>concentrations</b> in CH 4 found in various geologic environments to date, {{are defined as}} “natural” terrestrial extremes. We have discovered a new extreme in a natural gas seep with values of <b>deuterium</b> <b>concentrations,</b> δDCH 4, up to+ 124 ‰that far exceed those reported for any terrestrial gas. The gas, seeping from the small Homorod mud volcano in Transylvania (Romania), also has extremely high concentrations of nitrogen (N 92 vol. %) and helium (up to 1. 4 vol. %). Carbon isotopes in CH 4, C 2 H 6 and CO 2, and nitrogen isotopes in N 2 indicate a primary organic sedimentary origin for the gas (a minor mantle component {{is suggested by the}} 3 He/ 4 He ratio, R/Ra~ 0. 39). Both thermogenic gas formation modeling and Rayleigh fractionation modeling suggest that the extreme deuterium enrichment could be explained by an oxidation process characterised by a δDCH 4 and δ 13 CCH 4 enrichment ratio (ΔH/ΔC) of about 20, and may be accounted for by abiogenic oxidation mediated by metal oxides. All favourable conditions for such a process exist in the Homorod area, where increased heat flow during Pliocene–Quaternary volcanism may have played a key role. Finally we observed rapid variations (within 1 h) in C and H isotope ratios of CH 4, and in the H 2 S concentrations which are likely caused by mixing of the deep oxidized CH 4 –N 2 –H 2 S–He rich gas with a microbial methane generated in the mud pool of one of the seeps. We hypothesize that the unusual features of Homorod gas can be the result of a rare combination of factors induced by the proximity of sedimentary organic matter, mafic, metal-rich volcanic rocks and salt diapirs,leading to the following processes: a) primary thermogenic generation of gas at temperatures between 130 and 175 °C; b) secondary alteration through abiogenic oxidation, likely triggered by the Neogene–Quaternary volcanism of the eastern Transylvanian margin; and c) mixing at the surface with microbial methane that formed through fermentation in the mud volcano water pool. The Homorod gas seep is a rare example that demonstrates how post-genetic processes can produce extreme gas isotope signatures (thus far only theorized), and that extremely positive δDCH 4 values cannot be used to unambiguously distinguish between biotic and abiotic origin...|$|R

A multi-criteria approach was used to evaluate the simulation of two independent objective functions – stream flow and stream deuterium – against model and data errors. Particular emphasis was placed on different input and output sampling resolutions. The data indicate that moderate isotopic variability in the stream response between rainfall events, which is not captured using weekly tracer data, has little influence on model performance. In contrast, the input resolution of precipitation <b>deuterium</b> <b>concentrations,</b> which were much more variable, proved to be crucial. A low-parameterized Catchment Isotope Model (CIM) was developed and adequately reflects flow dynamics and deuterium peaks, but a simple assumption of ''good-mixing'' in the isotope module is not able to fully reproduce the daily stream deuterium dynamic. Multi-criteria evaluation, however, significantly constrained acceptable behavioural parameter sets and therefore reduced the model's degree of freedom.

The details had not been officially declassified in Russia when Sakharov was writing his memoirs, but in the Teller-Ulam design, soft X-rays emitted by the fission bomb were focused onto a cylinder of lithium deuteride to compress it symmetrically. This is called radiation implosion. The Teller-Ulam design also had a secondary fission device inside the fusion cylinder to assist with the compression of the fusion fuel and generate neutrons to convert some of the lithium to tritium, producing a mixture of deuterium and tritium. Sakharov's idea was first tested as RDS-37 in 1955. A larger variation of the same design which Sakharov worked on was the 50 Mt Tsar Bomba of October 1961, which was the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated.|$|E
40|$|Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) with a He- 3 {{ion beam}} is a {{powerful}} analytical technique for analysis of light elements in thin films. The main motivation for 3 He focused beam applications is lateral mapping of deuterium using the nuclear reaction D(He- 3,p) He- 4 in surfaces exposed to a tokamak plasma, where a lateral resolution in the pm-range provides unique information for fuel retention studies. At the microprobe at the Jozef Stefan Institute typical helium ion currents of 300 pA and beam dimensions of 4 x 4 mu m(2) can be obtained. This work is focused on micro-NRA studies of plasma-facing materials using a set-up consisting of a silicon partially depleted charge particle detector for NRA spectroscopy applied in parallel with a permanently installed X-ray detector, an RBS detector and a beam chopper for ion dose monitoring. A method for absolute deuterium quantification is described. In addition, plasma-deposited amorphous deuterated carbon thin films (a-C:D) with known D content were used as a reference. The method was used to study deuterium fuel retention in carbon fibre composite materials exposed to a deuterium plasma in the Tore Supra and TEXTOR tokamaks. The high lateral resolution of micro-NRA allowed us to make a detailed study {{of the influence of}} topography on the fuel retention process. We demonstrated that the surface topography plays a dominant role in the retention of deuterium. The deep surfaces inside the castellation gaps showed approximately two orders of magnitude lower <b>deuterium</b> <b>concentrations</b> than in areas close to the exposed surface.

40|$|Magnesium transition-metal alloys {{have a high}} hydrogen-storage {{capacity}} and show improved hydrogen-uptake and -release kinetics compared to magnesium alone. In the present study we have investigated the structure of bulk magnesium-titanium deuteride Mg 0. 65 Ti 0. 35 Dx prepared via mechanical alloying and gas-phase deuterium absorption by combined use of x-ray diffraction (XRD), neutron diffraction, and magic-angle-spinning 2 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The initial ball-milled alloy has two XRD-distinct Mg and Ti fcc phases. Even after prolonged exposure to deuterium gas at 75 bar and 175 [*]°C the materials with and without palladium catalyst are only partly deuterated. Deuterium loading causes the formation of, on the one hand, bct (rutile) MgD 2 nanodomains with interdispersed TiDy layers and, on the other hand, a separate fcc (fluorite) TiDz phase. The TiDy phase is XRD invisible, but shows clearly up at a 2 H NMR shift of − 43  ppm between the shift of MgD 2 (3 ppm) and the Knight shift of the TiDz phase (− 143  ppm). Exchange NMR indicates complete deuterium exchange at 25 [*]°C between the MgD 2 and TiDy phase within 1 s, as consistent with intimate contacts between these phases. Combined analysis of the XRD and NMR peak areas suggests that the <b>deuterium</b> <b>concentrations</b> y and z in the TiDy and TiDz domains are about 1. 5 and 2. 0, respectively. Comparing the intrinsic cell parameters of rutile MgH 2 and fluorite TiH 2, we propose that stabilization of the mixed nanocomposite may arise from a coherent coupling between the crystal structures of the rutile MgD 2 nanodomains and the thin layers of fcc TiDy. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|One {{major step}} needed for fusion {{to become a}} {{reliable}} energy source {{is the development of}} materials for the extreme conditions (high temperature, radioactivity and erosion) caused by hot plasmas. The main goal of the present study is to use and optimise ion beam methods (lateral resolution and sensitivity) to characterise the distribution of hydrogen isotopes that act as fuel. Materials from the test reactors JET (Joint European Torus), TEXTOR (Tokamak Experiment for Technology Oriented Research) and Tore Supra have been investigated. Deuterium, beryllium and carbon were measured by elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) and nuclear reaction analysis (NRA). To ensure high 3 D spatial resolution a nuclear microbeam (spot size < 10 µm) was used with 3 He and 28 Si beams. The release of hydrogen caused by the primary ion beam was monitored and accounted for. Large variations in surface (top 10 µm) <b>deuterium</b> <b>concentrations</b> in carbon fibre composites (CFC) from Tore Supra and TEXTOR was found, pointing out the importance of small pits and local fibre structure in understanding fuel retention. At deeper depths into the CFC limiter tiles from Tore Supra, deuterium rich bands were observed confirming the correlation between the internal material structure and fuel storage in the bulk. Sample cross sections from thick deposits on the JET divertor showed elemental distributions that were dominantly laminar although more complex structures also were observed. Depth profiles of this kind elucidate the plasma-wall interaction and material erosion/deposition processes in the reactor vessel. The information gained in this thesis will improve the knowledge of first wall material for the next generation fusion reactors, concerning the fuel retention and the lifetime of the plasma facing materials which is important for safety as well as economical reasons...|$|R

40|$|Since 2011 the JET tokamak {{has been}} {{operated}} {{with a metal}} ITER-like wall (JET-ILW) including castellated beryllium limiters and lamellae-type bulk tungsten tiles in the divertor. This has allowed for a large scale test of castellated plasma-facing components (PFC). Procedures for sectioning the limiters into single blocks of castellation have been developed. This facilitated morphology studies of morphology of surfaces inside the grooves for limiters after experimental campaigns 2011 – 2012 and 2013 – 2014. The deposition in the 0. 4 – 0. 5 [*]mm wide grooves of the castellation is 'shallow'. It reaches 1 – 2 [*]mm into the 12 [*]mm deep gap. <b>Deuterium</b> <b>concentrations</b> are small (mostly below 1 [*][*]×[*][*] 1018 cm− 2). The estimated total amount of deuterium in all the castellated limiters does not exceed the inventory of the plasma-facing surfaces (PFS) of the limiters. There are only traces of Ni, Cr and Fe deposited in the castellation gaps. The same applies to the carbon content. Also low deposition of D, Be and C has been measured {{on the sides of}} the bulk tungsten lamellae pieces. Modelling clearly reflects: (a) a sharp decrease in the measured deposition profiles and(b) an increase in deposition with the gap width. Both experimental and modelling data give a strong indication and information to ITER that narrow gaps in the castellated PFC are essential. X-ray diffraction on PFS has clearly shown two distinct composition patterns: Be with an admixture of Be–W intermetallic compounds (e. g. Be 22 W) in the deposition zone, whilst only pure Be has been detected in the erosion zone. The lack of compound formation in the erosion zone indicates that no distinct changes in the thermo-mechanical properties of the Be PFC might be expected...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of {{composition}} of fat, protein {{and water in}} the body is indicative for the determination of effects of changes in nutrition in terms of body reserves. Deuterium oxide dilution technique has been proposed as easy, reliable and non-destructive method of determining body composition using the ratios of protein:water and mineral:water to predict fat. Twenty Bos indicus (Boran) and 21 Boran × Holstein have been exposed for 4 years to calculated energy requirements for maintenance (M) (low) or M + 20 % (medium) and M + 40 % (high). In the third lactation these treatments were sub-divided into either low or high feeding level. Before deuterium application animals were weighed and a blood sample was collected from the jugular vein. Deuterium was slowly administered at 0. 3 g/kg fasted body weight, directly into the jugular vein and the syringe was rinsed with refilled blood. Blood samples were taken at 5, 7, and 9 h post infusion and <b>deuterium</b> <b>concentrations</b> in plasma were analysed using isotope mass spectroscopy (3960 nm against water). The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of the cows was assumed to amount to 0. 20 of body weight (BW), and empty body weight (EBW) was described as EBW = BW − GIT. Body composition was estimated in the following equations: Empty body water (kg) = 0. 4717 × BW (kg) + 0. 1536 × D 2 O-space (kg) – 25. 046 Empty body ash (kg) = 0. 0363 × BW (kg) + 0. 0231 × D 2 O-space (kg) – 5. 755 Empty body protein (kg) = 0. 1624 × BW (kg) + 0. 0165 × D 2 O-space (kg) – 11. 488 Empty body fat (kg) = 0. 3790 × BW (kg) – 0. 2955 × D 2 O-space (kg) – 42. 163 Previous feeding level and the genotype explained most {{of the differences between}} treat- ment groups. Boran cows showed higher levels of fat, but the difference of 20 % and 40 % of the previous medium and high treatment was still visible. Fat reserves from the cross- bred cows were strongly influenced by milk production, however, crossbreds previously on low plane of nutrition replenished their fat deposits instead of producing more milk when receiving higher amounts of feed...|$|R
