40|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> {{techniques}} have {{recently begun to}} gain industry acceptance. However, one barrier to effective flexible feeding solutions {{is a lack of}} knowledge of the underlying dynamics at work in flexible part feeders. This paper begins to address this topic. First, we discuss statistical modeling of the feeders â€™ sub-systems and the fed parts themselves. For each feeding situation, we construct a generalized semi-Markov process (GSMP) model of the system that is built from these constituent models. Such models allow for a compact description of the complete feeder system and are amenable to highlevel simulation and analysis. They can be used to answer questions regarding: the overall system throughput for a variety of parts, control strategies that may be employed to maximize throughput, and the trade-offs between different physical designs of the feeder versus the class of parts being fed. The paper closes with a discussion of future work that is required to mature our understanding of the control and modeling of flexible feeders. 1...|$|E

40|$|To rapidly <b>feed</b> {{industrial}} <b>parts</b> on {{an assembly}} line, Carlisle et. al. [7] proposed a <b>flexible</b> <b>part</b> <b>feeding</b> system that drops parts {{on a flat}} conveyor belt, determines position and orientation of each part with a vision system, and then moves them into a desired orientation. A robot arm with 4 degrees of freedom (DoF) is capable of moving parts through 6 DoF when equipped with a passive pivoting axis between the parallel jaws of its gripper. The idea is to grasp a part with 2 hard finger contacts such that it pivots, under gravity, into a desired orientation when lifted and replaced on the table. We refer to these actions as pivot grasps. This paper considers the planning problem. Given a polyhedral part shape, coefficient of friction {{and a pair of}} stable configurations as input, find pairs of grasp points that will cause the part to pivot from one stable configuration to the other. For some transitions, pivot grasps may not exist. For a part with n faces and m stable configurations, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Robots can {{modify their}} {{environment}} by manipulating objects. To fully exploit this ability, {{it is important}} to determine the manipulation capabilities of a given robot. Such characterization in terms of the physics and geometry of the task has important implications for manufacturing applications, where simpler hardware leads to cheaper and more reliable systems. This thesis develops techniques for robots to transfer parts from a known position and orientation to a goal position and orientation, and to orient parts by bringing them from an unknown initial orientation to a goal orientation.

40|$|<b>Parts</b> <b>feeding</b> to mixed-model {{assembly}} {{lines in the}} automotive industry is a large challenge, since diverse customer demands have increased the amount of parts handled within the production facilities; hence {{a large amount of}} parts can be categorized as low-volume parts. Existing theory states that the design of the <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> system impacts the performance of the production system, however, there is a gap in existing literature regarding research focusing on <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> policies appropriate for low-volume parts. The aim of this study is therefore to develop guidelines for when different <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> policies are suitable to apply for LVPs and highlight the effects of design options related to the <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> system. The aim has been broken down into three research questions which the study should answer: 1. How can low-volume parts be defined for <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> in the automotive industry? 2. Which <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> policies are suitable to use for low-volume parts, and for what part characteristics does each policy fit best? 3. How should the <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> system related to each <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> policy for low-volume parts be designed? A multiple case study of four companies within the automotive industry has been performed in order to fulfill the aim. The study has been qualitative and data has been collected through direct observations, semi-structured interviews and internal documents. It was identified that companies within the automotive industry can benefit from categorizing their parts based on consumption volume, where low-volume parts could be grouped into a separate segment. This allows for reduced complexity in the assignment of <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> policies. This study has concluded that it is less beneficial to use continuous supply for low-volume parts compared with other <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> policies. The assignment of <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> policies for low-volume parts can be performed based on part characteristics, where the part size and amount of part variants within the part family have been identified as most relevant to consider. Findings related to the design of the <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> system include that space limitations near the assembly line has a large influence on design choices. Furthermore, it is beneficial to consolidate parts when transporting them to the lineside presentation. In addition, the picking accuracy has been identified as more important for low-volume parts than picking efficiency, and picking information such as pick-by-voice can be helpful to enable increased accuracy of picking operations.

40|$|A new linear {{quadratic}} controller design procedure is {{proposed for the}} NASA/JPL Deep Space Network antennas. The antenna model is divided into a tracking subsystem and a flexible subsystem. Controllers for the <b>flexible</b> and tracking <b>parts</b> are designed separately by adjusting the performance index weights.

Next, the gains of the tracking part are determined, followed by the flexible controller final tune-up. In addition, the controller for the <b>flexible</b> <b>part</b> is designed separately for each mode; thus the design procedure consists of weight adjustment for small-size subsystems. Since the controller gains are obtained by adjusting the performance index weights, determination of the weight effect on system performance is a crucial task.

The fast marching method is used to carry out the subdomain decomposition. A probabilistic model of uncertainties is introduced.

40|$|International audienceThis {{presentation}} {{is devoted to}} the construction of a stochastic reduced- order model for complex beamlike dynamical structures having a high modal density in the low frequency range. In some cases, in the low-frequency, a dynamical structure can exhibit both the global elastic modes (which characterize this low-frequency range) and numerous local elastic modes. This situation appears for complex heterogeneous structures presenting stiff <b>parts</b> and <b>flexible</b> <b>parts.</b> The presence of these <b>flexible</b> <b>parts</b> induces numerous local reasonance in the low frequency range. Furthermore, in this case, the elastic modes cannot be separated into global elastic modes and local elastic modes. Indeed, due to the coupling between global elastic modes and local elastic modes, the deformation of some global elastic modes have local contributions and the deformation of some local elastic modes have global contributions. Then there are no efficient sorting method which could be used to select the elastic modes as global elastic modes or as local elastic modes...|$|R
40|$|Assembly {{operations}} that involve <b>flexible</b> <b>parts</b> differ greatly from rigid-part assembly {{due to the}} capacity of the parts to comply with motions of the manipulators by yielding to the contact forces. This natural compliance can be exploited in the design of tasks involving the manipulation of flexible loads.

The idea is illustrated through two case studies: an analysis of the problem of bending a flexible sheet, and experiments on an insertion task where a flexible beam has to be inserted in a hole with friction in the direction of insertion. 1 Introduction Robotic manipulation of flexible loads has only recently become part of the robotics literature, despite {{the fact that there are}} many industrial tasks that involve the assembly of <b>flexible</b> <b>parts.</b> Examples of such tasks include the plastic or rubber molding of car [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Today, the {{assembly}} of laser systems requires {{a large share of}} manual operations due to its complexity regarding the optimal alignment of optics. Although the feasibility of automated alignment of laser optics has been shown in research labs, the development effort for the automation of assembly does not meet economic requirements â€“ especially for low-volume laser production. This paper presents a model-based and sensor-integrated assembly execution approach for flexible assembly cells consisting of a macro-positioner covering a large workspace and a compact micromanipulator with camera attached to the positioner. In order to make full use of available models from computer-aided design (CAD) and optical simulation, sensor systems at different levels of accuracy are used for matching perceived information with model data. This approach is named "chain of refined perception", and it allows for automated planning of complex assembly tasks along all major phases of assembly such as collision-free path planning, <b>part</b> <b>feeding,</b> and active and passive alignment.
