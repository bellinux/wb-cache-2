5|$|As a Senator, Gravel became {{nationally known}} for his {{forceful}} but unsuccessful attempts to end the draft during the War in Vietnam and <b>for</b> <b>putting</b> the Pentagon Papers into the public record in 1971 at some risk to himself. He conducted an unusual campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1972 for Vice President of the United States, and then {{played a crucial role}} in getting Congressional approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1973. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1974, but gradually alienated most of his Alaskan constituencies and his bid for a third term was defeated in a primary election in 1980.|$|E

They all rely on his father for income, employed at a toothpaste factory, responsible <b>for</b> <b>putting</b> the caps on the tubes. However, Mr. Bucket eventually loses his job because the factory replaced him with a machine that puts the caps on the tubes. Down the street is Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) chocolate factory, which reopened after industrial espionage forced him into seclusion and sacking his employees. Charlie's Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) worked for Wonka before the termination.|$|E

The NLS has received praise for being one of the most valuable trainings offered by the BSA. Participants spend a weekend with Arrowmen {{in different parts of the}} region learning about the theory and practice of effective leadership. Each region is responsible for their NLS’s program, and the weekend is organized by the region chief and his support staff. Primary NLS staff go through a national training weekend called Train the Trainer, put on once every two years.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XI has {{a largely}} player-based economy, {{with a heavy}} {{reliance}} on auction houses {{in each of the}} major cities of Vana'diel. There are certain economic controls in place mainly in the form of fees <b>for</b> <b>putting</b> items up for auction. Transportation, auction house, item storage, and fees do not go to players; these gil sinks effectively remove money from the economy to prevent inflation. The city of Jeuno used to levy a tax on bazaar purchases inside the city, but it was removed in a patch in the December 2008 version update.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, choral {{associations}} became common in Maryland, and Baltimore, {{buoyed by the}} immigration of numerous Germans. These groups were formed {{for the purpose of}} instruction in choral music, eventually performing oratorios. The popularity of these choral associations helped to garner support among the local population <b>for</b> <b>putting</b> music education in the city's public schools. The Baltimore Oratorio Society, the Liederkranz and the Germania Männerchor were {{the most important of these}} associations, and their traditions were maintained into the 20th century by organizations like the Bach Choir, Choral Arts Society, Concert Artists of Baltimore, Handel Society and the Baltimore Symphony Chorus.|$|E
5|$|Members of the WSPU were {{sometimes}} heckled and derided for spoiling elections for Liberal candidates. On 18 January 1908, Pankhurst and her associate Nellie Martel {{were attacked by}} an all-male crowd of Liberal supporters who blamed the WSPU for costing them a recent by-election to the Conservative candidate. The men threw clay, rotten eggs, and stones packed in snow; the women were beaten and Pankhurst's ankle was severely bruised. Similar tensions later formed with Labour. Until party leaders made the vote for women a priority, however, the WSPU vowed to continue its militant activism. Pankhurst {{and others in the}} union saw party politics as distracting to the goal of women's suffrage and criticised other organisations <b>for</b> <b>putting</b> party loyalty ahead of women's votes.|$|E
5|$|Milburn {{felt that}} the opening {{chapters}} (and introduction) did well to establish the volume, and was happy with {{the inclusion of the}} more empirical contributions, given their potential theoretical significance. He picked out the chapters by Driessen, Boyer and Wissenburg respectively as highlights, suggesting that the contributions of Driessen and Boyer seemed to challenge the volume's second stated goal, and noting that, though it was strong, he disagreed with the claims of Wissenburg's chapter. Garner highlighted the contributions of Flanders and Driessen, and commended the editors <b>for</b> <b>putting</b> together the book. Hooley concluded his review by claiming that the book offered something to those interested in the place of animals in politics, but that much of its contents would be of more interest for those looking to read about environmental political theory.|$|E

Angered, Loco attempts to shoot him, but he is stopped by Burnett, who arrests him for attempted murder and prepares {{to take him to}} a prison in Tonopah. Before leaving, Burnett requests that the townspeople provide food for the outlaws. Meanwhile, Pauline becomes romantically and sexually involved with Silence while tending his wounds.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} quality and craft {{that went into the}} compilation's design. Jaz Rignall (USgamer) was {{impressed}} by the compilation's presentation and balance between frills and efficiency, and Dan Whitehead (Eurogamer) felt that the theatrical theme fit Rare's character. Reviewers considered Rare Replay a high-water mark for video game compilations—Kotaku called it the best since Valve's The Orange Box. On the other hand, Jeremy Parish (USgamer) found the contemporaneous Mega Man Legacy Collection Criterion Collection-style presentation to be a more authentic appreciation of its original material. Chris Plante (The Verge) saw Rare Replay slight hardware improvements and added touches as a viable model <b>for</b> <b>putting</b> retrogames back on the market and slowing the tide of unlicensed downloads.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{occasional}} tension between those musicians {{who went into}} exile, and were therefore able to perform for, and raise awareness among, much larger audiences, and anti-apartheid musicians who remained in South Africa. The latter group has received significantly less popular attention, though Vershbow states that it played an equally {{important role in the}} movement, and Schumann argues that it was responsible <b>for</b> <b>putting</b> significant pressure on the apartheid government. The role of music in social change in South African is examined in the documentary film , released in 2002. The film focuses specifically on the 'liberation music' of the struggle against white domination.|$|E

5|$|To resolve {{an endless}} cycle of vendettas between two clans, Hanpu {{managed to make}} both parties accept a new rule: from then on, {{the family of a}} killer would {{compensate}} the victim's relatives with a gift of horses, cattle, and money. Historian Herbert Franke has compared this aspect of Jurchen customary law to the old Germanic practice of Wergeld. As a reward <b>for</b> <b>putting</b> an end to the feuds, Hanpu was married to a sixty-year-old woman who then bore him one daughter and two sons. A lost book called the Shenlu Ji states that Hanpu's wife was 40 years old. Hanpu and his descendants were then formally received into the Wanyan clan.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, Live from Paris {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} critics, who praised it as a showcase of Shakira's versatility. One reviewer, however, criticised the singer <b>for</b> <b>putting</b> {{less emphasis on}} vocals {{and more on the}} dance routines. Commercially, the album performed well on the charts of France and Mexico, where it was later certified platinum by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP) and Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON), respectively. In the United States, En Vivo Desde Paris peaked at number two on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, and at number one on the Latin Pop Albums chart.|$|E
5|$|As a {{response}} to the cancellation, fans created online petitions, called Netflix, and tweeted #RenewSense8 and other hashtags, in an attempt to bring back the show. On June 8, 2017, the show's social media accounts acknowledged the fans' efforts, and wrote that Netflix looked into the renewal of Sense8 a second time, however they concluded it wasn't possible. Smith released a letter to the fans reiterating the reason for the cancellation was low viewership, and explaining that the reason he rallied them to voice their support before the show was officially cancelled, was that once that happens, there is no going back. He praised Netflix for their support while making the show, and thanked the fans <b>for</b> <b>putting</b> up a great fight to keep it alive. On June 10, 2017, Chief Content Officer of Netflix Ted Sarandos during his talk on Produced By Conference, explicitly commented the show was cancelled because its audience, despite being very passionate, wasn't large enough to support the high production costs to travel and film around the globe.|$|E

5|$|As {{his sons}} had desired and planned, Wilberforce {{has long been}} viewed as a Christian hero, a statesman-saint held up {{as a role model}} <b>for</b> <b>putting</b> his faith into action. More broadly, he has also been {{described}} as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action. In the 1940s, the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams, who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics, as the West Indian sugar industry was in decline. Williams' approach strongly influenced historians for much of {{the latter part of the}} 20th century. However, more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of abolition, and this has led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the Evangelicals, as well as a recognition of the anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government. A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons. The fabric material was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy <b>for</b> <b>putting</b> out a fire.|$|E
5|$|Okehampton Castle {{was built}} between 1068 and 1086 {{following}} the Norman conquest of England by Baldwin FitzGilbert. William the Conqueror defeated the Anglo-Saxon forces {{at the battle}} of Hastings in 1066, but violence continued to flare up periodically for several years after the invasion. Baldwin FitzGilbert, a Norman lord, was responsible <b>for</b> <b>putting</b> down a rebellion in Devon in 1068. He was probably given extensive lands in the county at this time, and by the time of Domesday Book in 1086 he was noted as the owner of the Honour of Okehampton and well as the Sheriff of Devon and Constable of Exeter Castle. The Honour of Okehampton was a grouping of around 200 estates across Devon, guarded by several castles, including Baldwin's main castle - or caput - at Okehampton, and those owned by his tenants, including Neroche and Montacute.|$|E
