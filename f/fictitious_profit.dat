50|$|Period costs, such as office {{salaries}} {{or selling}} expenses, are immediately recognized as expenses (and offset against revenues {{of the accounting}} period) also when employees are paid in the next period. Unpaid period costs are accrued expenses (liabilities) to avoid such costs (as expenses fictitiously incurred) to offset period revenues {{that would result in}} a <b>fictitious</b> <b>profit.</b> An example is a commission earned at the moment of sale (or delivery) by a sales representative who is compensated {{at the end of the}} following week, in the next accounting period. The company recognizes the commission as an expense incurred immediately in its current income statement to match the sale proceeds (revenue), so the commission is also added to accrued expenses in the sale period to prevent it from otherwise becoming a <b>fictitious</b> <b>profit,</b> and it is deducted from accrued expenses in the next period to prevent it from otherwise becoming a fictitious loss, when the rep is compensated.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{when the}} {{accounting}} periods are monthly, an 11/12 portion of an annually paid insurance cost {{is added to}} prepaid expenses, which are decreased by 1/12 of the cost in each subsequent period when the same fraction is recognized as an expense, rather than all in the month in which such cost is billed. The not-yet-recognized portion of such costs remains as prepayments (assets) to prevent such cost from turning into a fictitious loss in the monthly period it is billed, and into a <b>fictitious</b> <b>profit</b> in any other monthly period.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, cash {{paid out}} for (the cost of) goods and {{services}} not received {{by the end of}} the accounting period is added to the prepayments to prevent it from turning into a fictitious loss in the period cash was paid out, and into a <b>fictitious</b> <b>profit</b> in the period of their reception. Such cost is not recognized in the income statement (profit and loss or P&L) as the expense incurred in the period of payment, but in the period of their reception when such costs are recognized as expenses in P&L and deducted from prepayments (assets) on balance sheets.|$|E

He did this by claiming <b>fictitious</b> <b>profits</b> on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, SIMEX, and using money requested from London as margin payments on fictitious trades to finance his loss-making positions.|$|R
50|$|To resolve {{any and all}} {{potential}} civil claims by the government against the Shapiro family, the family agreed to forfeit $625 million to the government—an amount in excess of Shapiro and his wife’s current net worth, {{as well as in}} excess of the <b>fictitious</b> <b>profits</b> that Shapiro and his wife took out of BLMIS. The settlement contains no finding or admission of fault against Shapiro or his family; the settlement does not, however, release any party from criminal liability.|$|R
50|$|For example, goods {{supplied}} by a vendor in one accounting period, but paying {{for them in}} a later period results in an accrued expense that prevents a fictitious increase in the receiving company's value equal {{to the increase in}} its inventory (assets) by the cost of the goods received, but unpaid. Without such accrued expense, a sale of such goods in the period they were supplied would cause that the unpaid inventory (recognized as an expense fictitiously incurred) would effectively offset the sale proceeds (revenue) resulting in a <b>fictitious</b> <b>profit</b> in the period of sale, and in a fictitious loss in the latter period of payment, both equal to the cost of goods sold.|$|E
5000|$|Conspiracy of Fools {{tells the}} story of the 2001 {{collapse}} of Enron. Enron's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Andrew Fastow is depicted as voraciously greedy, using front corporations and partnerships, paying himself [...] "management" [...] and [...] "consultant" [...] fees as if he were an outsider, all while cooking Enron's books to show <b>fictitious</b> <b>profits.</b> In the 1980s there were questionable activities at the company, but the bulk of the events depicted in the book occur from 1997 onward and led to Enron's collapse.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{types of}} {{balancing}} accounts exist to avoid <b>fictitious</b> <b>profits</b> and losses {{that might otherwise}} occur when cash is paid out {{not in the same}} accounting periods as expenses are recognized, because expenses are recognized when obligations are incurred regardless when cash is paid out according to the matching principle in accrual accounting. Cash can be paid out in an earlier or latter period than obligations are incurred (when goods or services are received) and related expenses are recognized that results in the following two types of accounts: ...|$|R

According to the original federal charges, Madoff said that his firm had [...] "liabilities of approximately US$50 billion".

40|$|This study compares {{incentive}} {{effects of}} various tax depreciation methods currently adopted in European transition economies. In these countries straight-line, geometric-degressive and accelerated depreciation measures are quite popular {{in combination with}} different corporate tax rates. Their generosity is determined {{on the basis of}} Samuelson’s true economic depreciation. For this purpose, the present value model is applied under the particular consideration of different financial structures. In this context the traditional Modigliani-Miller theorem for capital structure is revisited. Furthermore, the aspect of inflation is integrated into the model. The central issue is that the historical cost accounting method generally applied for the calculation of the corporate tax base causes <b>fictitious</b> <b>profits</b> in inflationary phases that are also taxed. Therefore, in an inflationary period generous tax depreciation provisions do not promote private investment as designed, but partly compensate such additional tax burdens caused by inflation. true economic depreciation, tax depreciation rules, corporate tax, investment decision, financial structure, net present value model, inflation, transition economies...|$|R
40|$|Decision {{making in}} supply chains is {{influenced}} by demand variations, and hence sales, purchase orders and inventory levels are therefore concerned. This paper presents a non-linear optimization model for a two-echelon supply chain, for a unique product. In addition, the model includes the consumers’ maximum willingness to pay, taking socioeconomic differences into account. To do so, the constrained multinomial logit for discrete choices is used to estimate demand levels. Then, a metaheuristic approach based on particle swarm optimization is proposed to determine the optimal product sales price and inventory coordination variables. To validate the proposed model, a supply chain of a technological product was chosen and three scenarios are analyzed: discounts, demand segmentation and demand overestimation. Results are analyzed {{on the basis of}} profits, lotsizing and inventory turnover and market share. It can be concluded that the maximum willingness to pay must be taken into consideration, otherwise <b>fictitious</b> <b>profits</b> may mislead decision making, and although the market share would seem to improve, overall profits are not in fact necessarily better...|$|R
40|$|Ponzi schemes {{lay their}} {{foundation}} on fraud. Once the con is exposed, the culprits are usually {{stripped of their}} pilfered millions and sent off to jail. Unfortunately for the victims, the process of recovering any portion of the money they lost in the scam is, to put it mildly, complicated. The challenge rests, in part, in differences between federal forfeiture statutes and Bankruptcy Code principles in determining what assets can be recovered and who is entitled to {{a portion of the}} Ponzi pie. What is a Ponzi scheme (as defined by the courts rather than the media) ? The Second Circuit defines a Ponzi scheme as a “fraudulent investment scheme in which money contributed by later investors is used to pay artificially high dividends to the original investors, creating an illusion of profitability, thus attracting new investors. ” The Ninth Circuit has embraced an arguably broader description: “any sort of fraudulent arrangement that uses later acquired funds or products to pay off previous investors. ” Other courts add that the scheme did not “conduct legitimate business as represented to investors. ” In essence, a Ponzi scheme is a “money in, money out” con game. After the scheme collapses, as it inevitably does, Ponzi investors fall into two broad categories. The first is the “net losers” – investors who failed to receive a full return, or in many cases any return, on their principal investment, because their contributions were used to satisfy other investors’ expectations. The other broad category is “net winners” – “lucky” investors who received redemption payments that exceed the value of their principal investments. Recoupment of <b>fictitious</b> <b>profits</b> may subject the net winners to disgorgement of those profits and, in some instances, even disgorgement of principal (although this largely applies only to net winners). Beyond these broad categories, there often are “feeder funds” – various hedge funds, brokerage houses, and banks that steered large pools of investors into the Ponzi scheme. Relationships with feeder funds enable the Ponzi schemer to sustain the scam {{over a longer period of}} time by sweeping in thousands of smaller investors. These victims may find two areas of law interacting to determine recovery and distribution of the Ponzi scheme assets. Cite as 42 Golden Gate U. L. Rev 587 (2012) ...|$|R
