5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and <b>docosahexaenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>DHA).</b> A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia.

Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA.

40|$|Abstract: The {{very high}} {{enrichment}} {{of the nervous}} system in the polyunsaturated fatty acids, arachidonic (AA, 20 : 4 n- 6) and <b>docosahexaenoic</b> <b>acids</b> (<b>DHA,</b> 22 : 6 n- 3), is dependant of the dietary availability of their respective precursors, linoleic (18 : 2 n- 6) and -linolenic acids (18 : 3 n- 3). Inadequate amounts of DHA in brain membranes have been linked {{to a wide variety of}} abnormalities ranging from visual acuity and learning irregularities, to psychopathologies. However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown. Several years ago, we hypothesized that a modification of DHA contents of neuronal membranes by dietary modulation could change the neurotransmission function and then underlie inappropriate behavioural response. We showed that, in parallel to a severe loss of brain DHA concomitant to a compensatory substitution by 22 : 5 n- 6, the dietary lack of -linolenic acid during development induced important changes in the release of neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine) in cerebral areas specifically involved in learning, memory and reward processes. Data suggested alteration of presynaptic storage process and dysregulations of reciprocal functional interac-tions between monoaminergic and cholinergic pathways. Moreover, we showed that recovery of these neurochemical changes was possible when the deficient diet was switched to a diet balanced in n- 3 and n- 6 PUFA before weaning. The next step is to understand the mechanism involved. Particularly, we focus on the study of the metabolic cooperation between the endothelial cell, the astrocyte and the neuron which regulate synaptic transmission. These works could contribute to the understanding of the link between some neuropsychiatric disorders and the metabolism of n- 3 PUFA, through their action on neurotransmission...|$|R
5000|$|Three {{omega-3 fatty}} acids are {{important}} in human physiology, α-linolenic acid (18:3, n-3; ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, n-3; EPA), and <b>docosahexaenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (22:6, n-3; <b>DHA).</b> [...] These three polyunsaturates have either 3, 5, or 6 double bonds in a carbon chain of 18, 20, or 22 carbon atoms, respectively. As with most naturally-produced fatty acids, all double bonds are in the cis-configuration, in other words, the two hydrogen atoms {{are on the same}} side of the double bond; and the double bonds are interrupted by methylene bridges (--), so that there are two single bonds between each pair of adjacent double bonds.|$|R
40|$|The anti-atherogenic {{effects of}} omega 3 fatty acids, namely eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and <b>docosahexaenoic</b> <b>acids</b> (<b>DHA)</b> are well {{recognized}} but {{the impact of}} dietary intake on bioactive lipid mediator profiles remains unclear. Such a profiling effort may offer novel targets for future studies into the mechanism of action of omega 3 fatty acids. The present study aimed to determine the impact of DHA supplementation on the profiles of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) oxygenated metabolites and to investigate their contribution to atherosclerosis prevention. A special emphasis {{was given to the}} non-enzymatic metabolites knowing the high susceptibility of DHA to free radical-mediated peroxidation and the increased oxidative stress associated with plaque formation. Atherosclerosis prone mice (LDLR(-/-)) received increasing doses of DHA (0, 0. 1, 1 or 2 % of energy) during 20 weeks leading to a dose-dependent reduction of atherosclerosis (R(2)  =  0. 97, p =  0. 02), triglyceridemia (R(2)  =  0. 97, p =  0. 01) and cholesterolemia (R(2)  =  0. 96, p< 0. 01). Targeted lipidomic analyses revealed that both the profiles of EPA and DHA and their corresponding oxygenated metabolites were substantially modulated in plasma and liver. Notably, the hepatic level of F 4 -neuroprostanes, a specific class of DHA peroxidized metabolites, was strongly correlated with the hepatic DHA level. Moreover, unbiased statistical analysis including correlation analyses, hierarchical cluster and projection to latent structure discriminate analysis revealed that the hepatic level of F 4 -neuroprostanes was the variable most negatively correlated with the plaque extent (p< 0. 001) and along with plasma EPA-derived diols was an important mathematical positive predictor of atherosclerosis prevention. Thus, oxygenated n- 3 PUFAs, and F 4 -neuroprostanes in particular, are potential biomarkers of DHA-associated atherosclerosis prevention. While these may contribute to the anti-atherogenic effects of DHA, further in vitro investigations are needed to confirm such a contention and to decipher the molecular mechanisms of action...|$|R
