5|$|One {{class of}} honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>is.</b> The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain was}} {{slightly}} sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much {{expansion of the}} cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird. This {{is in keeping with}} the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating a good sense of smell. Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear, which control balance, shows that the head was held at a 25° angle below horizontal. This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral semicircular canal was parallel to the ground, as <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>is</b> when an animal is in an alert posture.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of aposematism {{is to prevent}} attack, by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defences such as being unpalatable or poisonous. The easily detected warning is a primary defence mechanism, and the non-visible defences are secondary. Aposematic signals are primarily visual, using bright colours and high-contrast patterns such as stripes. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} saw {{a substantial}} increase in international media coverage. Eighty foreign media representatives from a multitude of countries registered for an event at the Foreign Ministry held during the election weekend as <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>is.</b> The journalists also got to ask questions to the representatives of the various political parties. As the results came in, the Foreign Ministry set up broadcast coverage with interpreters on hand. Notably, most journalists were interested in the True Finns and their background. The following day, the Foreign Ministry invited professor Jan Sundberg of the Department of Political and Economic Studies at the University of Helsinki to lead an analysis of the result. He was asked about the reasons for the True Finns' performance and the commonality with other European populist movements. There was also discussion about the possible composition of a new government and how the different parties could find common ground during talks on government formation. Sundberg said he believed an agreement could be found within the following few weeks.|$|E
25|$|In {{acoustics}} or psychophysiology, {{the distinction}} may be objective.

25|$|Thionyl {{chloride}} {{is mainly}} {{used in the}} industrial production of organochlorine compounds, which are often intermediates in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals. <b>It</b> <b>usually</b> <b>is</b> preferred over other reagents, such as phosphorus pentachloride, as its by-products (HCl and SO2) are gaseous, which simplifies purification of the product.|$|E

25|$|An operon {{contains}} {{one or more}} structural genes {{which are}} generally transcribed into one polycistronic mRNA (a single mRNA molecule that codes {{for more than one}} protein). However, the definition of an operon does not require the mRNA to be polycistronic, though in practice, <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>is.</b> Upstream of the structural genes lies a promoter sequence which provides a site for RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription. Close to the promoter lies a section of DNA called an operator.|$|E
25|$|Aldosterone is a {{function}} of the inverse of the sodium intake as sensed via osmotic pressure. The slope of the response of aldosterone to serum potassium is almost independent of sodium intake. Aldosterone is increased at low sodium intakes, but the rate of increase of plasma aldosterone as potassium rises in the serum is not much lower at high sodium intakes than it is at low. Thus, the potassium is strongly regulated at all sodium intakes by aldosterone when the supply of potassium is adequate, which <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>is</b> in primitive diets.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>usually</b> <b>is</b> {{found in}} yellow-poplar, sassafras, and {{magnolia}} trees. Its distribution is {{east of the}} Mississippi River in all areas where its native hosts exist. It has been noted that its preferred host is Yellow-poplar. Historically, infestations are localized within natural hardwood forests and have rarely been considered a major threat. However, during the 1960s, several outbreaks caused serious loss of foliage on Yellow-poplar populations in the Ohio River Valley and Appalachian Mountain regions. Recent concerns focus on young Yellow-poplar transplants that are placed in urban and suburban landscapes. Severe infestations in saplings could damage tree foliage, reduce their ornamental value, and possibly cause low survival rates.|$|E

25|$|The {{other form}} of doctor's gown is the undress gown. This is a black gown (which {{may or may not}} be {{distinct}} from the master's gown depending on the university; if it is, <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>is</b> trimmed with lace, braid or other subtle indicators of rank) worn for less formal occasions such as lectures. This type of gown is rarely seen or worn nowadays as many wear the dress gown instead; there are fewer applications for the undress gown in normal university life. However, the undress gown still plays a part in the older universities where academic dress is usually worn. At Cambridge, each doctor has its own undress gown, each trimmed differently, meaning one can identify the degree of the wearer without the hood (the same is also the case for bachelors and masters gowns at Cambridge).|$|E
25|$|Usually {{more than}} half of all nests manage to hatch at least one young, and around three-quarters of all eggs laid hatch, {{suggesting}} that if eggs are lost before hatching, <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>is</b> the entire clutch. Half to three-quarters of the hatched young successfully fledge under most circumstances. They will become sexually mature in their first spring and often attempt to breed right away. On average, great grey shrikes get a chance at four breeding attempts during their life, with most birds in the wild getting eaten by a bird of prey or carnivorous mammal or dying of other causes before the end of their fifth winter. Raptorial birds are the main threat to shrikes after fledging, with regular predators including species as small as little owls (which are close to the same size as the shrike). The maximum documented lifespan, however, is 12 years.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the time}} average of a {{function}} of the form cos(ωt+k) is zero provided that ω is nonzero. Therefore, the only product terms that have a nonzero average are those where the frequency of voltage and current match. In other words, it is possible to calculate active (average) power by simply treating each frequency separately and adding up the answers. Furthermore, if we assume the voltage of the mains supply is a single frequency (which <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>is),</b> this shows that harmonic currents are a bad thing. They will increase the rms current (since there will be non-zero terms added) and therefore apparent power, but they will have no effect on the active power transferred. Hence, harmonic currents will reduce the power factor. Harmonic currents can be reduced by a filter placed at the input of the device. Typically this will consist of either just a capacitor (relying on parasitic resistance and inductance in the supply) or a capacitor-inductor network. An active power factor correction circuit at the input would generally reduce the harmonic currents further and maintain the power factor closer to unity.|$|E

25|$|The same report {{noted that}} the low Great Lakes levels were drought-induced, caused by a very hot, dry summer {{and a lack of}} a solid snowpack in the winter of 2012. At the time of the report, December 2012, Lake Michigan-Huron was 28 inches below its {{long-term}} average which is near the record lows of 1964. Historic lake levels for Lake Michigan reported from 1918 to 1998 show that the low levels observed in 1964 were the lowest since 1918. In 2012 Lake Michigan-Huron’s seasonal rise was about 4 inches where <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>is</b> about 12 inches. Normally the Chicago River water level is two feet lower than the lake and therefore does not flow into the lake. If the lake level falls too low threatening to reverse the river flow, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago would be forced to close locks between the lake and river {{for longer periods of time}} limiting navigation. A reversal flow of the Chicago River into Lake Michigan would have a negative impact on navigation and on the quality of Lake Michigan water which is the source of drinking water. Chicago's raw sewage in the river is normally carried upstream toward the Mississippi River which flows south towards the Gulf of Mexico. On January 9, 2013 Chicago meteorologists announced 320 days without at least one inch of snowfall. Water levels in the lake started to level off with the river and sewage was visible at the cusp of the locks, just a few hundred feet from Lake Michigan. David St. Pierre, executive director of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago warned the low lake levels were nearing a point of real concern. However, the District maintains that it is not possible for the River to reverse due to low lake level alone.|$|E
