50|$|In {{addition}} to the tendency to move a body {{in the direction of}} its application, a force can also tend to rotate a body about an axis. The axis may be any line which neither intersects nor is parallel to the line of action of the force. This rotational tendency is known as the moment (M) of the <b>force.</b> <b>Moment</b> is also referred to as torque.|$|E
50|$|The {{unbalanced}} spin creates spin magnetic moment, {{making the}} electron {{act like a}} very small magnet. As the atoms pass through the in-homogeneous magnetic field, the <b>force</b> <b>moment</b> in the magnetic field influences the electron's dipole until its position matches {{the direction of the}} stronger field. The atom would then be pulled toward or away from the stronger magnetic field a specific amount, depending on the value of the valence electron's spin. When the spin of the electron is +1/2 the atom moves away from the stronger field, and when the spin is −1/2 the atom moves toward it. Thus the beam of silver atoms is split while traveling through the in-homogeneous magnetic field, according to the spin of each atom's valence electron.|$|E
5000|$|Even on a {{perfectly}} flat LP, tonearms {{are prone to}} two types of tracking errors that affect the sound. As the tonearm tracks the groove, the stylus exerts a frictional force tangent to the arc of the groove, and since this force does not intersect the tone arm pivot, a clockwise rotational <b>force</b> (<b>moment)</b> occurs and a reaction skating force is exerted on the stylus by the record groove wall away from center of the disc. Modern arms provide an anti-skate mechanism, using springs, hanging weights, or magnets to produce an offsetting counter-clockwise force at the pivot, making the net lateral force on the groove walls near zero. The second error occurs as the arm sweeps in an arc across the disc, causing the angle between the cartridge head and groove to change slightly. A change in angle, albeit small, will have a detrimental effect (especially with stereo recordings) by creating different forces on the two groove walls, {{as well as a}} slight timing shift between left/right channels. Making the arm longer to reduce this angle is a partial solution, but less than ideal. A longer arm weighs more, and only an infinitely long pivoted arm would reduce the error to zero. Some designs (Burne-Jones, and Garrard [...] "Zero" [...] series) use dual arms in a parallelogram arrangement, pivoting the cartridge head to maintain a constant angle as it moves across the record. Unfortunately this [...] "solution" [...] creates more problems than it solves, compromising rigidity and creating sources of unwanted noise.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} {{was to examine the}} critical vortex-induced vibration (VIV) point for cylinders in a rotational system. For translational systems, the existence of a critical mass ratio for cylinders undergoing vortex-induced vibration has been well established. At mass ratios below this critical point, the reduced velocity at VIV lock-out tends to infinity, resulting in the resonance forever condition as described by the authors first reporting this phenomenon. The approach adopted in the present investigation involved measuring the VIV response of a positively buoyant pivoted cylinder being towed at very high reduced velocity. High reduced velocity was attained by establishing a very low system natural frequency. The key finding of this study is the presence of a critical point with a value {{similar to that of the}} critical mass ratio in translational systems. This critical point appears to be governed by the <b>force</b> <b>moment</b> ratio rather than the mass moment of inertia ratio. In the present study, a critical <b>force</b> <b>moment</b> ratio of 0. 512 ± 0. 002 was determined as the onset point for the infinite VIV lock-in regime...|$|E
