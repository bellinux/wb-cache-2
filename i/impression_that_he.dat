5|$|In mid-May, Nixon, {{interviewed by}} David Broder of The Washington Post, {{mentioned}} the Maryland governor {{as a possible}} running mate. As Agnew continued to meet with Nixon and with the candidate's senior aides, there was a growing <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was moving into the Nixon camp. At the same time, Agnew denied any political ambitions beyond serving his full four-year term as governor.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{had given}} Mackintosh the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would if {{possible}} attempt his crossing during the coming 1914–15 Antarctic season. Before departing for the Weddell Sea, {{he changed his}} mind about the feasibility of this timescale. Mackintosh was not informed of this change of plan; this misunderstanding led to the underprepared and near-chaotic depot-laying journeys of January–March 1915.|$|E
5|$|After {{giving the}} <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wished to negotiate, Ivan Alexander, {{reinforced}} by Mongol cavalry, overwhelmed the smaller but better organized Byzantine {{army in the}} Battle of Rusokastro. The contested cities surrendered to Ivan Alexander, while Andronikos III sought refuge {{within the walls of}} Rusokastro. The war ended with Ivan Alexander meeting Andronikos and agreeing a peace based on the status quo. To seal the alliance, he betrothed his eldest son, Michael Asen IV, to Andronikos's daughter Maria (Eirene), the marriage eventually taking place in 1339. The Bulgarian emperor was now free to turn his attentions to Belaur, {{but it was not until}} 1336 or 1337 that the rebellion in the northwest was put down.|$|E

Robert California (James Spader) makes a {{spontaneous}} visit and asks them {{to come up with}} Dunder Mifflin/Sabre's next big idea. However, the office fails to impress Robert with their ideas. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) details an idea he has about cookie placement in the vending machine, but Robert gets the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is extremely clever and is speaking only in metaphors. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who has been annoyed the entire day with Kevin being creative and Robert rejecting his ideas, later tricks Kevin into explaining an idea he has involving the Big Mac, and Robert realizes that there was no subtext to Kevin's ideas.|$|E
5|$|On 22 April 2012, Chen {{escaped from}} house arrest. Chen's fellow activist Hu Jia stated that Chen had been {{planning}} escape for a long time, and had previously attempted to dig a tunnel for escape. In {{the weeks leading up}} to his escape, Chen gave his guards the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was ill in bed, and stopped appearing outside the house, which allowed him several days before any absence would be discovered. Under cover of darkness and with the help of his wife, Chen climbed over the wall around his house, breaking his foot in the process.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{large number}} of battles {{attributed}} to Wellington. Although many leave the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was present or in command at those actions, it was sometimes the case that he entrusted other officers to engage the enemy, such as at remote locations, and that he could not have attended them all in person. Similarly, Wellington was not usually in command of rear guard actions, during advances or retreats, despite his army engaging in them often. Engagements where the lack of his presence is absolutely certain, or where his position is unconfirmed by records and accounts, are not included in his battle record.|$|E

5|$|While other spies such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Klaus Fuchs {{were caught}} after the war, Koval {{apparently}} went unscrutinized for years. Among the reasons given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. Another {{possibility is that}} the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving them with the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{might have been a}} spy. The matter was kept confidential for sixty years as the US was afraid of the damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When they would ask what he did for a living, he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is levitating.|$|E
50|$|Rainey and Schwantz {{raise their}} hands to stop the race, but ahead of them Lawson and Sarron {{continue}} at race pace. Lawson soon becomes aware {{of the water and}} raises his hand too, but Sarron, perhaps under the mistaken <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he’s</b> dropping the other three, seems too enthusiastic to stop and loses the front-end on a fast left. The riders pit with 5 laps raced.|$|R

5|$|Nomura {{redesigned}} Cloud for {{his appearance}} in Kingdom Hearts. He is depicted with a claw and a crimson cape, and {{the blade of}} his sword is wrapped in bandages. Stating that Cloud's left arm was inspired by Vincent Valentine, Nomura explained {{that he wanted to}} give the character a more demon-like appearance due to his ties to the dark side in the game. Nomura stated that he wanted to leave the question of whether Cloud was searching for Aerith open to the player's interpretation. Teruaki Sugawara, the game's voice director, recommended Takahiro Sakurai, Cloud's Japanese voice actor, to Nomura for the role. Nomura had originally asked Sakurai to play the protagonist of The Bouncer, Sion Barzahd, but found that his voice best suited Cloud after hearing him speak. Sakurai received the script without any accompanying visuals, and first arrived for recording under the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be voicing a different character than the one featured in Final Fantasy VII.|$|E
5|$|According {{to those}} historians, the Spanish {{revolution}} against absolutism got {{mixed up with}} the Peninsular War. When FerdinandVII stood against his father CharlesIV, who {{was seen as an}} absolutist king, many Spaniards got the mistaken <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sympathized with the new enlightened ideas. Thus, the revolutions made in the Americas in the name of FerdinandVII (such as the May Revolution, the Chuquisaca Revolution, or the one in Chile) would have sought to replace absolutist power with power formulated under the new ideas. Even if Spain was at war with France, the ideals of the French Revolution (liberty, equality and fraternity) were still respected. Those revolutions pronounced themselves enemies of Napoleon, but did not face any active French military attack; they promoted instead fights between Spanish armies for keeping either the old or new order. This situation would change with the final defeat of Napoleon and the return of FerdinandVII to the throne, as he began the Absolutist Restoration and persecuted the supporters of the new libertarian ideas within Spain. For people in South America, to stay {{as a part of the}} Spanish Empire, but with a new relationship with the mother country, was no longer a feasible option: the only remaining options at this point were to return to absolutism or to adopt independentism.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} {{home from the}} {{sanatorium}} in late 1955, Starkey entered the workforce but was lacking in motivation and discipline; his initial attempts at gainful employment proved unsuccessful. In an effort to secure himself some warm clothes, he briefly held a railway worker's job, which came with an employer-issued suit. He was supplied with a hat but no uniform and, unable to pass the physical examination, {{he was laid off}} and granted unemployment benefits. He then found work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that travelled from Liverpool to North Wales, but his fear of conscription into military service led him to quit the job, not wanting to give the Royal Navy the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was suitable for seafaring work. In mid-1956, Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice machinist at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford, and the two bonded over their shared interest in music. Trafford introduced Starkey to skiffle, and he quickly became a fervent admirer.|$|E

5|$|Khánh had {{a meeting}} with Lodge in the morning of the coup for around an hour after {{arranging}} a meeting through Wilson. Due to concerns as to whether Washington would express support for the coup and what the official policy was, the meeting was not held at the embassy but at the home of Lodge's aide Dunn. However, if Lodge was concerned about keeping a low profile regarding the coup, Khánh was not, arriving at Dunn's residence with seven jeeploads of aides before embracing Lodge. He told Lodge that he would go after the communists aggressively and that the coup would not disrupt the military in any significant way. Khánh vowed to intensify the war effort, ask Lodge for guidance constantly, introduce democracy and install a direct phone line between Vietnamese military headquarters and the US Embassy. Lodge also reported that Khánh wanted to give the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> seriously thought that neutralist deal involving de Gaulle was a genuine and ominous prospect, and that de Gaulle had made much progress in influencing the previous administration.|$|E
5|$|With {{the truce}} and the {{recognition}} {{that he would not}} conquer Denmark, Harald turned his attention to England. England had belonged to Harthacnut, the son of Cnut the Great, until he died childless in 1042. Harald based his claim to the throne of England on an agreement made between Magnus and Harthacnut in 1038, which stated that if either died, the other would inherit the throne and lands of the deceased. When Harthacnut died, Magnus assumed the crown of Denmark and considered himself the lawful heir to Harthacnut. While Edward the Confessor had himself crowned English king in his absence, Magnus had planned to invade England in 1045, only to be forced to turn his fleet towards Denmark due to an uprising by Sweyn Estridsson. Although the threat was temporarily averted by Magnus's death in 1047, Edward's negotiations with his enemies throughout the 1050s gave Harald (as well as Sweyn Estridsson and William of Normandy) an <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a possible heir to Edward. When Edward died in January 1066, he was to Harald's dismay succeeded by Harold Godwinson, a son of one of Edward's advisors.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a network of foreign businessmen in Japan who could be turned into an intelligence network in time of war, it was suggested by his commander, Colonel Burnett, that Mashbir resign his commission and become a businessman in Tokyo himself, {{in order to put}} the M-Plan in effect. Consequently, Mashbir resigned in 1923 to pursue business interests and undercover secret intelligence operations, under the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could be reinstated in the Army when his work was done. However the Great Kantō earthquake of September 1923 bankrupted him and, when he sought reinstatement in the military, discovered that it was not possible, because the reinstatement clause of the law under which he had resigned was no longer valid. Neither Mashbir nor Colonel Burnett, who had urged Mashbir to resign, was aware of this, and it become a sticking point for Mashbir in later life, noting that even in 1926 the law was still being reprinted without the correct clause. Consequently, the M-Plan to establish an intelligence network in Japan was scrapped. Mashbir returned to the United States in 1926 under the impression that his military career was over, and sought employment selling refrigerators. He managed to rejoin the Military Intelligence Division G-2 Reserves, but only spent one year in active duty beginning in the summer of 1927 during which time he updated the Order of Battle documentation on Japan. For the next ten years he returned to his original profession of engineering, including some government work on technical standards.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} two Tests, Hutton shared three {{consecutive}} century opening partnerships with Cyril Washbrook. A four-hour 94 in the first innings was followed by 76 in the second. Press opinion was divided over Hutton's performance; some critics, including the Australian bowlers, detected insecurity against fast bowling, particularly the bouncers with which Ray Lindwall and Miller targeted him. Hutton's preferred tactic of ducking under the ball reinforced the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was afraid. In the final Test, Hutton scored a century, batting through the first day to score 122 not out, his first Test century in Australia, despite another barrage from Lindwall and Miller. The Sydney Morning Herald criticised {{the high number of}} short balls bowled by the Australian pacemen, bowled at Hutton as often as three times per over. After the second day was rained off, Hutton was taken ill overnight with tonsillitis, missed the remainder of the match and flew home soon after. In all first-class matches on tour, Hutton scored 1,267 runs at an average of 70.38, while in the Tests, he managed 417 runs at an average of 52.12; he topped both sets of averages. Wisden noted that it took him time to find form in the Tests, but that he often batted well despite ill health. Bill Bowes, covering the tour as a journalist, believed that Hutton was unable to master bowling faster than he had encountered for eight years, but acquitted himself reasonably well.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hill led {{the rest}} of the battalion, {{approximately}} 525 strong, in some commandeered trucks towards the town of Béja, an important road and railway centre approximately forty miles from the airfield. The battalion arrived at approximately 18:00 and was welcomed by the local French garrison, 3,000 strong, which Hill persuaded to cooperate with the paratroopers; in order to give the garrison and any German observers the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> possessed a larger force than he actually did, Hill arranged for the battalion to march through the town several times, wearing different headgear and holding different equipment each time. A short time after the battalion entered Béja, German aircraft arrived and bombed the town, although they caused little damage and no casualties. The next day, 'S' Company was sent with a detachment of engineers to the village of Sidi N'Sir, about twenty miles away; they were to contact the local French forces, believed to be proBritish, and harass German forces. The detachment found the village and made contact with the French, who allowed them to pass through towards the town of Mateur; by nightfall the force had not reached the town, and decided to encamp for the night. At dawn a German convoy of armoured cars passed the detachment, and it was decided to set an ambush for the convoy if it returned, with anti-tank mines being laid on the road and a mortar and Bren guns being set up in concealed positions. When the convoy returned at approximately 10:00 the leading vehicle struck a mine and exploded, blocking the road, and the other vehicles were disabled with mortar fire, Gammon bombs and the remaining antitank mines. A number of Germans were killed and the rest taken prisoner, with two paratroopers being slightly wounded. The detachment returned to Béja with prisoners and several slightly damaged armoured cars. After the success of the ambush, Hill sent a second patrol to harass local German forces, but it was withdrawn after it encountered a larger German force that inflicted several British casualties; Béja was also bombed by Stuka divebombers, inflicting civilian casualties and destroying a number of houses.|$|E
