After the formation of Malaysia, Sarawak GDP growth rate has risen due to increase in petroleum output and the rise in global petroleum prices. However, the state economy is less diversified and still heavily dependent upon the export of primary commodities when compared to Malaysia overall. The per capita GDP in Sarawak was lower {{than the national average}} from 1970 to 1990. As of 2016, the urban-rural <b>income</b> <b>gap</b> remained a major problem in Sarawak.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Past {{investigations}} of the <b>income</b> <b>gaps</b> between Jews and non-Jews in Israel treat non-Jews as one group. In this paper we separate the non-Jewish group into three main religious minorities: Muslims, Christians and Druze {{and focus on the}} northern part of Israel, where most minorities live. Using the latest Israeli census, we find significant explained and unexplained <b>income</b> <b>gaps</b> in favor of Jews. The unexplained gaps tend to be larger the more educated the individual. Jews have much higher representation in the more lucrative occupations, and earn significantly more in them. In almost every dimension Muslims suffer from the largest <b>income</b> <b>gaps.</b> Druze, on the other hand, enjoy the lowest <b>income</b> <b>gaps</b> across most of the income distribution, {{due in large part to}} direct and indirect benefits they reap from serving in the army. Among minorities, Christians are the most educated and most concentrated in the top occupations, which explains why they enjoy the lowest gaps in the highest percentiles of the income distribution.

25|$|Research done in 2011 {{showed that}} the “weight double standard” may be more complex that what past {{research}} has suggested. This is not only relevant to women, but also to men. The smallest <b>income</b> <b>gap</b> differences occur at thin weights (where men are penalized and women are rewarded) and the opposite happens at heavier weights, where the women are affected more negatively.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of Korean reunification, a flood of North Koreans to a much more {{developed}} South Korea may cause the country's economy to undergo a heavy burden that will cost upwards of $1 trillion USD, possibly creating a period of economic collapse or stagnation.

30|$|On {{the average}} level, {{nearly half of}} the average wage {{difference}} between monopoly and competition industry is unreasonable, which is caused by monopolization. From the view of income levels, the <b>income</b> <b>gaps</b> between monopoly industry and competitive industry get widened as the income quantile increases. Specifically, at the quantile points of 10, 50, and 90 %, the <b>income</b> <b>gaps</b> are 9.4, 52, and 60.6 % respectively and the proportions of the unreasonable part are 26, 71, and 72 % respectively.|$|R

We perform country-specific and panel cointegration techniques to assess the long-run impact of inward FDI stocks on income inequality among households in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay. The panel cointegration analysis reveals a significant and positive effect on income inequality. Furthermore, FDI contributed to widening <b>income</b> <b>gaps</b> in all individual sample countries, except for Uruguay. Our findings are robust to the choice of different estimation methods.

25|$|Economic and {{technological}} growth {{during this period}} improved the standard for living, which expanded opportunities for education. Workers with higher education were absorbed by the rapidly growing industrial and commercial sectors, and urban population surged. Construction of the Gyeongbu Expressway was completed and linked Seoul to the nation's southeastern region and the port cities of Incheon and Busan. Despite the immense economic growth, however, {{the standard of living}} for city laborers and farmers was still low. Laborers were working with low wages to increase the price competitiveness for the export-oriented economy plan, and farmers were in near poverty as the government controlled prices. As the rural economy steadily lost ground and caused dissent among the farmers, however, the government decided to implement measures to increase farm productivity and income by instituting the Saemauel Movement ("New Village Movement") in 1971. The movement's goal was {{to improve the quality of}} rural life, modernize both rural and urban societies and narrow the <b>income</b> <b>gap</b> between them.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} give all {{employees}} the same access to decision-making, the basic organisations of associated labor were also applied to public services, including health and education. The basic organizations were usually made up {{of no more than}} a few dozen people and had their own workers' councils, whose assent was needed for strategic decisions and appointment of managers in enterprises or public institutions. The results of these reforms however were not satisfactory. There have been rampant wage-price inflations, substantial rundown of capital plant and consumer shortages, while the <b>income</b> <b>gap</b> between the poorer southern and the relatively affluent northern regions was unchanged. The self-management system stimulated the inflationary economy that was needed to support it. Large state-owned enterprises operated as monopolists with unrestricted access to capital that was shared according to political criteria. Oil crisis of 1973 magnified the economic problems, which the government tried to solve with extensive foreign borrowing. Although such actions resulted in a reasonable rate of growth for a few years (GNP grew at 5.1% yearly), such growth was unsustainable since the rate of foreign borrowing grew at an annual rate of 20%.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the princely states, free imperial cities, nominally {{under the control of}} the Emperor but really ruled by councils that acted like sovereign governments, were scattered throughout the Empire. As the Reformation took root, clashes broke out in many cities between local reformers and conservative city magistrates. It was in a free imperial city, Strasbourg, that Martin Bucer began his work. Located on the western frontier of the Empire, Strasbourg was closely allied with the Swiss cities that had thrown off the imperial yoke. Some had adopted a reformed religion distinct from Lutheranism, in which humanist social concepts and the communal ethic played a greater role. [...] Along with a group of free imperial cities in the south and west of the German lands, Strasbourg followed this pattern of Reformation. It was ruled by a complex local government largely under the control of a few powerful families and wealthy guildsmen. In Bucer's time, social unrest was growing as lower-level artisans resented their social immobility and the widening <b>income</b> <b>gap.</b> [...] The citizens may not have planned revolution, but they were receptive to new ideas that might transform their lives.|$|E

The title was {{possibly}} more meaningful than it appears at first glance, as on January 31 {{it was announced}} that bass player Taiji had left the group. The official reason given for his departure was due to musical differences. However, in his autobiography, Taiji claims he was asked to leave because he confronted Yoshiki due to the substantial <b>income</b> <b>gap</b> between Yoshiki and each of the other members. When asked about Taiji's departure in 2016, Yoshiki said [...] "he crossed the line of our band's rules" [...] and [...] "To this day I still don't know if the decision was right or wrong, but we didn't have a choice." [...] On August 24, 1992, the band held a press conference in New York at Rockefeller Center. There, Heath (ex:Media Youth) was announced as their new bass player. Around this time, the band's success in Japan made an international breakthrough appear likely, leading to them leaving Sony for an American record contract with Atlantic Records and the renaming of the band from X to X Japan, in order to distinguish from the American punk group X. (An American album release would never happen.) Their first show with Heath was at the October 1992 Extasy Summit at Osaka-jō Hall.|$|E

This study assesses <b>income</b> <b>gaps</b> between various demographic groups in regard to households' residence, administrative region, education, employment status and gender at various income quantiles, using unconditional quantile regressions. Gaps are decomposed into parts due to differentials in household endowments and due to differentials in returns to endowments. Rural/urban <b>income</b> <b>gaps</b> are evident across all evaluated countries, particularly in China, India and Russia, but have been falling in Russia and Taiwan.

30|$|Our {{findings}} have important {{theoretical and practical}} implications for understanding the issue of income inequality in China. This study not only provides empirical evidence supporting the idea of labor market segmentation theory, but also shows the multiplicity and complexity of labor market segmentation, which offers insights by which we can further refine the current theory. Furthermore, as shown by this study, macro structures such as region and industry characteristics are important sources of widening income inequality in China. Therefore, reducing the imbalance in regional development and limiting inter-industry <b>income</b> <b>gaps</b> are both critical to our ability to narrow the large <b>income</b> <b>gaps</b> in contemporary China. In particular, policy priority {{should be given to}} how to trim industrial monopoly given that it is the singly most important structural factor that drives income inequality across different social groups. Determining how best to eliminate the status privilege associated with administrative monopoly and to restrict the rapid increases in income for high ranking managerial staff members, while simultaneously raising ordinary workers’ income, should be the priority for the ongoing reform of income distribution.|$|R
30|$|The {{past few}} decades have {{witnessed}} a notable surge in economic growth, but one which {{has been accompanied by}} an equally daunting degree of inequity under various forms, with wider <b>income</b> <b>gaps</b> and deepening poverty in many cities across the world. Economic inequality is seriously detrimental to the equitable distribution among individuals of opportunities to pursue a life of their choosing and be spared from extreme deprivation in outcomes. According to recent reports, <b>income</b> <b>gaps</b> between rich and poor are expanding in both developed and developing countries [6, 151]. In OECD countries, inequalities are as steep as they have been for over 30  years. In advanced economies, the average income of the richest 10 % of the population is about nine times higher than that of the poorest 10 %. In Europe’s Nordic countries, the average is a multiple of six but growing, compared with multiples of 10 in Italy, Korea and the United Kingdom [151], and up to 14 in Israel, Turkey and the United States [6].|$|R
