40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the history of}} the O’Donel estate in West Mayo, from the purchase of the estate by Sir Neal O’Donel {{in the late eighteenth century}} to the sale of most of the estate, in the 1850 s in the Encumbered Estates Court, by his grandson Sir Richard Annesley O’Donel. The estate was purchased from John Thomas Medlicott and Thomas John Medlicott for £ 33, 589 19 s 4 d, which was equal to nineteen years and a half purchase of the rental income minus the <b>head</b> <b>rent</b> amounting to £ 1722 11 s 3 d per year. 1 The O’Donels owned land in three baronies of Mayo, the Tarmon estate in the barony of Erris, the Cong estate in the barony of Kilmaine and the Newport estate in the barony of Burrishoole. Included in the sale of lands by the Medlicotts was also land in Counties Tipperary, Kilkenny and Waterford but this was probably disposed of almost immediately as the only reference to it in the O’Donel papers is in the deed of sale of 17 July 1774...|$|E
50|$|Investing $6,000 of poker winnings, <b>Head</b> <b>rented</b> {{the corner}} of an {{electrical}} shop and started work on a composite ski. The main portion of the ski was built of the standard laminate, but this left the edges of honeycomb exposed. For protection, he capped the sides with thin sheets of plywood. The ski was laid up in pieces {{and covered with a}} thermosetting shoemaker's glue. The glue required pressure and heat to bond, which normally required large moulds to provide the pressure. Head {{came up with the idea}} of placing the skis in a heavy rubber bag, pumping out the air to produce a vacuum to provide pressure, and then immersing the entire assembly in a barrel of boiling crankcase oil.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Inequalities and inequities {{in health}} are an {{important}} public health concern. In Switzerland, mortality {{in the general population}} varies according to the socio-economic position (SEP) of neighbourhoods. We examined the influence of neighbourhood SEP on presentation and outcomes in HIV-positive individuals in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). METHODS: The neighbourhood SEP of patients followed in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) 2000 - 2013 was obtained on the basis of 2000 census data on the 50 nearest households (education and occupation of household <b>head,</b> <b>rent,</b> mean number of persons per room). We used Cox and logistic regression models to examine the probability of late presentation, virologic response to cART, loss to follow-up and death across quintiles of neighbourhood SEP. RESULTS: A total of 4489 SHCS participants were included. Presentation with advanced disease [CD 4 cell count < 200  cells/μl or AIDS] and with AIDS was less common in neighbourhoods of higher SEP: the age and sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR) comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of SEP was 0. 71 [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 58 - 0. 87] and 0. 59 (95 % CI 0. 45 - 0. 77), respectively. An undetectable viral load at 6 months of cART was more common in the highest than in the lowest quintile (OR 1. 52; 95 % CI 1. 14 - 2. 04). Loss to follow-up, mortality and causes of death were not associated with neighbourhood SEP. CONCLUSION: Late presentation was more common and virologic response to cART less common in HIV-positive individuals living in neighbourhoods of lower SEP, but in contrast to the general population, there was no clear trend for mortality...|$|E

60|$|In {{these days}} money was not {{plentiful}} with the Desmonds. Not but that their estates were as wide almost as their renown, {{and that the}} Desmonds were still great people in the country's estimation. Desmond Court stood in a bleak, unadorned region, almost among the mountains, half way between Kanturk and Maccoom, and the family had some claim to possession of the land for miles around. The earl {{of the day was}} still the head landlord of a huge district extending over the whole barony of Desmond, and half the adjacent baronies of Muskerry and Duhallow; but the <b>head</b> landlord's <b>rent</b> in many cases hardly amounted to sixpence an acre, and even those sixpences did not always find their way into the earl's pocket. When the late earl had attained his sceptre, he might probably have been entitled to spend some ten thousand a year; but when he died, and during the years just previous to that, he had hardly been entitled to spend anything.|$|R

After their arrival in the mountains above El Llano, Owsley quickly found the location of the charred remains of the murdered journalists and began collecting human remains and artifacts commingled in the dirt. After the excavation, he prepared the bone fragments and artifacts for transport, and returned to Washington, D.C. Once the remains were examined in his laboratory at the Smithsonian, Owsley was able to make a positive identification of both individuals.|$|R

Nothing {{particular}} was wanted but {{the money to buy}} it; and, not having the little amount in his own possession, Mr. James Smith makes a virtue of necessity, and goes back overland to his wife with private designs on her purse-strings. Number Two, who objects to be left behind, goes with him as far as London. There he trumps up the first story that comes into his <b>head</b> about <b>rents</b> in the country, and a house in Lincolnshire that is too damp for her to trust herself in; and so, leaving her for a few days in London, starts boldly for Darrock Hall. His notion was to wheedle your mistress out of the money by good behavior; but it seems he started badly by quarreling with her about a fiddle-playing parson--" ...|$|R

She resolves to change her ways and make him a good wife. Upon meeting Bob, he tells her they can marry the following week when he can take time off from his work, and gives her three pounds to rent a room (since his landlady will not let Stella stay with him) and buy herself food until the wedding day, promising to meet up with her that evening when his work shift ends. She <b>heads</b> out to <b>rent</b> the room, but her route takes her through Leicester Square, where she visits her prostitute friends and squanders the three pounds on a pair of earrings.|$|R
50|$|Krip {{was born}} into a Punjabi middle-class family hailing from Delhi. Krip had always dreamt of {{becoming}} a successful actor, though he wasn’t born with a silver spoon. Krip didn’t even have money to enroll himself into an acting school. In an interview he stated that— “I arrived in Mumbai ten years ago on 17 January 2003 and was living in a room with eight people. I was unable to pay rent and was out on the streets for three days. On seeing me sleeping on the streets a generous soul offered me accommodation till I could afford to find a roof over my <b>head</b> and pay <b>rent</b> for the same. I was also without any morsel of food for six days.” However he soon passed this struggling phase with his strong dedication towards acting.Krip has a great interest in photography.And also a great football player too.“Well, acting is my career. But yes, along with acting, I would like to work really hard on my photography skills. I want to keep a really good collection of photographs clicked by me. My camera is my best friend.” says he.|$|R
50|$|In Belgium, {{as well as}} in {{some parts}} of the Netherlands, senior {{students}} celebrate their last 100 days of high school with a special day called Chrysostomos or 100-dagen feest (“100-days party”). Tradition states that on this winter day, seniors are allowed to pull pranks on their teachers and fellow students. Some schools handle a theme as dresscode, while others go for the traditional outfit: blue jeans, a black cotton jacket, a black hat (with a red or blue ribbon) and a whistle around the neck. Some even paint their faces and some seniors also carry a spray can (shaving cream or other fluids) to “attack” the non-seniors with. A noisy march through town is also part of the gig. Later during the day, students perform an act at school, usually a silly show involving school or a parody. In the evening, students <b>head</b> to a <b>rented</b> club to party. This involves dancing, singing and lots of beer to get a taste of fraternity life. Sometimes even teachers join the party to show that they too have a wild side. In the Netherlands, households where a child who has passed their high school exams often hang the student's backpack on a flagpole which is attached to the front of the house.|$|R
50|$|During {{the post-war}} period, the company's {{successful}} business strategies made {{it one of}} Montreal's largest white-collar employers, {{one of the top}} corporations in Canada, as well as a global player in the life insurance field. For {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the city of Montreal had been the economic hub of Canada, but it was losing ground to Toronto. As early as 1950, Toronto's economic activity surpassed Montreal's with regards to stock market trading and capitalization. The advent, in the 1960s, of political and terrorist movements demanding the independence of Quebec from Canada cast a pallor of uncertainty over the business community. In 1977, the newly elected sovereigntist Quebec government passed the Charter of the French Language (known as Bill 101), making the use of French language mandatory for medium- and large-scale companies when communicating with French-speaking staff. This law was received negatively by the English-speaking business community, many of whom perceived that the historical rights of the English-speaking minority should be respected. On January 6, 1978, the company downsized the Montreal facilities to serve as a branch service bureau while shifting its <b>head</b> office to <b>rented</b> space in Toronto, Ontario. Officially, Sun Life said it was motivated by the political instability and economic uncertainty of Quebec's future, but skeptics said it was the company's unwillingness to comply with the requirements of Bill 101. In 1979, the company acquired a property at University Avenue and King Street in downtown Toronto and constructed a new office complex, the Sun Life Centre, which was completed in 1984.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the impact of camel salt transportation service on the livelihood of pastoralists in Berahle woreda, Afar regional state of Ethiopia. A cross sectional primary data of 250 sample households (including 115 camel owners and 135 camel non-owners) was used for analysis. Propensity score matching (PSM) method was implemented to capture the livelihood contribution of camel salt transportation service for the camel owner pastoral households in the study area. Four matching algorithms (Nearest- Neighbour, Kernel, Radius and Stratification) were used for estimation and their result was consistent which shows their robustness. Income, livestock ownership and fixed asset formation of the households were used as livelihood indicators to compare the livelihood differences between the camel owner and non-owner households. Accordingly, a positive and significant difference was found in two of the livelihood indicators i. e., income and livestock ownership, but not fixed asset holdings between the two groups of households. The paper has also tried to identify the main determinant factors influencing the camel rent decision of the camel owner pastoral households using ordered probit regression model. The result reveals that, literacy of the household head and number of camels owned by the household are the factors affecting household <b>head’s</b> decision to <b>rent</b> out his/her camels for other salt transporters or not. Another focus of the study was, identifying the main beneficiaries of the salt mine among the salt trade value chain participants and calculating the profit percentage share of the salt transporters, using descriptive statistics. Based on the analysis, the salt transporters were found to be the main beneficiaries among the salt trade value chain participants...|$|R
