5|$|Dannatt met his wife, Philippa ("Pippa"; née Gurney) {{during his}} first year at Durham University in 1973. The couple became engaged, and married in March 1977, after which Pippa {{accompanied}} Dannatt on his return to Berlin. They had four children—three boys and one girl.

5|$|Dannatt was {{appointed}} Commander, Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (COMARRC) on 16 January 2003 and promoted to lieutenant general the same day. During his tenure, he was predominantly concerned with planning for possible {{deployment of the}} ARRC in <b>Iraq</b> <b>and</b> <b>Afghanistan.</b> It was eventually deployed to Afghanistan, but not until after Dannatt had handed over its command to David Richards. Dannatt was knighted with his investiture as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in June 2004. He succeeded Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman as Commander-in-Chief, Land Command (CINCLAND)—responsible for day-to-day running of the Army—on 7 March 2005, and was promoted to full general the same day. The prevailing issue during his tenure as Commander-in-Chief was the reorganisation of the infantry, an emotive issue as it resulted {{in the loss of}} many historic regimental names, including Dannatt's regiment, the Green Howards, which became 2nd Battalion, the Yorkshire Regiment (Green Howards). However, his term also coincided with an increase in the intensity of simultaneous operations in <b>Iraq</b> <b>and</b> <b>Afghanistan,</b> and Dannatt formed the view that government spending priorities did not accurately reflect the commitments of the British Armed Forces at the time.|$|E

5|$|In July 2010, Dannatt gave {{evidence}} to the Iraq Inquiry, focusing predominantly on his role as ACGS in 2002.

He also repeated his previous assertions that the army had been over-stretched by simultaneous operation in <b>Iraq</b> <b>and</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> in 2006 and re-stated his view that Afghanistan was the more important for British interests. Dannatt's evidence was followed by that of his predecessor as CGS, General Sir Mike Jackson.|$|E
