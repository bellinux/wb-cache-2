40|$|Clay veins {{found in}} coal mines have caused {{numerous}} injuries and fatalities. These structures plague {{all phases of}} mining, including entry development, pillar recovery, and panel extraction. Clay veins also increase production costs and may disrupt or halt mining. These detrimental aspects have prompted the Bureau of Mines to investigate the physical characteristics of and roof instability problems associated with clay veins. This was accomplished by observing and mapping clay veins in surface and underground mines. The occurrence and origins of clay veins were also investigated to determine predictive capabilities. The investigators found that clay veins normally occur in more stable, less rapidly subsiding coal basins. Clay veins result when tensile stresses develop fissures which are later infilled. These fissures can be propagated by compactional processes and/or tectonic stresses active during and subsequent to coalification. The Bureau also found that associated faults, fractures, and slicken-side planes commonly parallel clay veins and disrupt the lateral continuity of the immediate and, sometimes, main roof. When clay veins parallel or subparallel the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>face</b> <b>advance,</b> the roof is segmented into cantilever beams, causing unstable conditions. Consequently, the strata {{on either side of}} the clay veins should be bolted and strapped together to form a beam...|$|E

30|$|A major {{natural hazard}} {{associated}} with LGOM (Legnica-Glogow Copper Mining) mining is the dynamic phenomena occurrence, physically observed as seismic tremors. Some of them generate {{effects in the}} form of relaxations or bumps. Long-term observations of the rock mass behaviour indicate that the degree of seismic hazard, and therefore also seismic activity in the LGOM area, is affected by the great depth of the copper deposit, high-strength rocks as well as the ability of rock mass to accumulate elastic energy. In this aspect, the effect of the characteristics of initial stress tensor and the orientation of considered mining panel in regards to its components must be emphasised. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} answer the question, which of the factors considered as “influencing” the dynamic phenomena occurrence in copper mines have a statistically significant effect on seismic activity and to what extent. Using the general linear model procedure, an attempt has been made to quantify the impact of different parameters, including the depth of deposit, the presence of goaf in the vicinity of operating mining panels and the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> mining <b>face</b> <b>advance,</b> on seismic activity based on historical data from 2000 to 2010 concerned with the dynamic phenomena recorded in different mining panels in Rudna mine. The <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> mining <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> as well as the goaf situation in the vicinity of the mining panel are of the greatest interest in the case of the seismic activity in LGOM.

30|$|The <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed also {{significantly}} affected wall spalling. The observations at the No. 8105 coal face demonstrated {{that with the}} increase <b>of</b> <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed, there was a reduction of damage area around the coal wall, and a reduction of wall horizontal displacement. In other words, the spalling of coal wall was suppressed. It is therefore suggested that the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed should be rationally increased to reduce the exposure time and spalling of coal wall. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of controlling coal wall spalling was limited through the increase <b>of</b> <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed. With {{a large amount of}} observations on site, the effect <b>of</b> increasing <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed on coal wall spalling was found.

40|$|This U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) report evaluates three stress-transfer-modification {{concepts}} {{for their}} potential in reducing longwall gate road stresses and closures. In {{each of the}} three concepts - packwalling, gob infilling, and entry filling -support structures are constructed on the headgate side of the panel parallel with or inby the face line. When the headgate becomes the tailgate of the adjacent panel, these structures are in place to accept stresses transferred from the mined-out panel. Using the USBM nonlinear boundary-element program MULSIM/NL, baseline models of typical longwall stress transfer behavior were developed for both intermediate depth and deep mining conditions. These models were verified by comparing model results with field measurements and observations. The stress-transfer-modification concepts were then incorporated into the deep baseline model to quantify the effects of each concept on tailgate closure. Modeling results indicated that entry filling is the most effective concept in reducing tailgate escapeway closure. Using only 18 m 3 of a weak fill per meter <b>of</b> <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> (7. 3 yd 3 per ft <b>of</b> <b>face</b> <b>advance),</b> tailgate escapeway closure was reduced by 33 %.
