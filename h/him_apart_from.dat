5|$|With Irvine, Nomura {{tried to}} strike a balance between not overshadowing Squall and not {{becoming}} too unattractive. He gave Irvine a handsome appearance, but a casual personality, hoping that this would make him less attractive than Squall. Keeping with this idea, Nomura gave him goggles; however, this idea was abandoned in favor of an American cowboy-like appearance to set <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> other goggle-wearing characters in the Final Fantasy series.|$|E
5|$|Although Harvey {{started as}} a wicketkeeper at school, he became a highly {{regarded}} cover fielder and later in his international career became an agile slips catcher. He bowled off spin from a three to four pace approach on rare occasions, taking only three wickets in his Test career. Away from the field, Harvey had a quiet and unassuming manner, in complete contrast to his dynamic batting, and his non-smoking, non-drinking set <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> the prevailing cricket culture of his period. Harvey {{was known for his}} respect for umpiring decisions and for never appealing for leg before wicket when he fielded in the slips.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn enjoyed {{early success}} in Germany, {{where he also}} revived {{interest}} in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, and in his travels throughout Europe. He was particularly well received in Britain as a composer, conductor and soloist, and his ten visits there– during which many of his major works were premiered– form {{an important part of}} his adult career. His essentially conservative musical tastes set <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> many of his more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Charles-Valentin Alkan and Hector Berlioz. The Leipzig Conservatoire (now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig), which he founded, became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook.|$|E

50|$|Although a pupil of Duncan Grant, {{a leading}} {{member of the}} Bloomsbury Group, Harris’s love of the Old Masters - in {{particular}} J. M. W. Turner and John Constable - influenced his painting {{and at the same}} time set <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> stylistically <b>from</b> his contemporaries. He was also influenced by the Impressionists.|$|R
5000|$|His granddaughter {{later wrote}} about him: 'He {{was not a}} saint, nor even a clever man... But I do not ever {{remember}} hearing from him an ungenerous remark, or seeing <b>him</b> angry <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> minor irritations. His great gift was single-mindedness, and a simplicity that perhaps {{could not see the}} difficulties which a more sophisticated mind might see.' ...|$|R
5|$|Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky {{was educated}} {{for a career}} as a civil servant. There was scant {{opportunity}} for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Fung {{is having}} tea {{in a public}} square {{surrounded}} by his subordinates. He sees a beautiful woman (Kwai's pregnant friend) having tea in the same square. As {{he tries to get}} her attention, a large group of children come asking him to buy charity stickers. The children place stickers on Fung and his men. The pregnant woman leaves the square and meets up with Costello, then tells him that the man back in the square with the most number of stickers is Fung. Costello thanks her, makes his way to the square and begins to shoot a great many of the guards as well as Fung as chaos ensues. However, Fung turns out to be wearing a bulletproof vest. His subordinates help him run away from Costello, who gives chase on foot. As Costello walks, he checks the bystanders for stickers, which tips Fung off to the fact that Costello does not actually recognize <b>him,</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> the stickers he is wearing. Fung removes the stickers from his coat, and puts them on the jacket of a subordinate instead. This causes Costello to shoot Fung's subordinate. Fung then removes his coat with all the stickers and runs off.|$|E
5|$|The rest of Constantine's 1928 {{tour was}} {{generally}} successful; {{only in the}} three Test matches, the first played by the West Indies, was he less effective. Although he took the West Indies' first wicket in Test cricket, dismissing Charlie Hallows, and finished with innings figures of four for 82, he took only one more wicket during {{the remainder of the}} series and ended with five wickets at an average of 52.40; with the bat, he scored 89 runs in six innings at 14.83. Even so, Jack Hobbs said that Constantine's opening overs to him in the first Test were among the fastest he ever faced, Constantine believed his captain, Karl Nunes, over-bowled him; the pair did not get along well. When the tour ended, Constantine had scored more runs and taken more wickets and catches in first-class games than any other tourist. He was second in the team's batting averages with 1,381 runs at 34.52, and led the bowling averages with 107 wickets at 22.95. It was the manner in which Constantine played which set <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> the restrained form of cricket generally played in England at the time: his style, aggression and entertainment value made a big impression on the crowds. According to Peter Mason in his biography of Constantine, he established a unique style of West Indian cricket and possibly established the template for West Indian cricketers for years to come.|$|E

"He's {{a member}} of China's 'in-between' {{generation}} — {{too young to have}} directly witnessed life under Mao, but old enough to remember the Tiananmen Square uprising — which sets <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> both <b>from</b> his older peers who lived through the Cultural Revolution and from younger colleagues who have known only relative openness and growing international awareness of China's experimental art scene." ...|$|R
50|$|In the Middle Ages it was {{claimed that}} the Devil threw the stone there from Castleton, Derbyshire, about 40 mi away, because the ringing of church bells annoyed <b>him.</b> Quite <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> the fancifulness of the legend, {{it should be noted}} that there is no New Red Sandstone outcrop in that part of Derbyshire from which the stone could have come.|$|R
60|$|Ignorance was Shefford's {{safeguard}} against himself. To {{make a name}} of this heretofore intangible man, to give <b>him</b> {{an identity}} <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> the crowd, {{to be able to}} recognize him--that for Shefford would be fatal.|$|R
25|$|The Doctor has a {{deep sense}} of right and wrong, and a {{conviction}} that it is right to intervene when injustice occurs, which sets <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> his own people, the Time Lords, and their strict ethic of non-intervention.|$|E
25|$|Woodward had an encyclopaedic {{knowledge}} of chemistry, and an extraordinary memory for detail. Probably the quality that most set <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> his peers was his remarkable ability to tie together disparate threads of knowledge from the chemical literature {{and bring them}} to bear on a chemical problem.|$|E
25|$|His {{innovative}} talents {{extended into}} his playing style, including licks, trills, chording sequences, fretting techniques and timing, which set <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> his contemporaries and inspired many guitarists {{of the present}} day. He recorded with his wife Mary Ford in the 1950s, and they sold millions of records.|$|E
50|$|He is {{a father}} dog with bandaged body and his skull partly cloven by a saber {{which does not}} affect <b>him</b> at all <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> a headache. He is a proud hypochondriac with a loving son.|$|R
5000|$|Manley also {{described}} {{his pursuit of}} two mistresses, and Skipworth's philandering led to <b>him</b> living <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> his wife {{on at least one}} occasion. In 1707, Isabella Wentworth, a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Anne, wrote privately of his return: [...] "Sir Thomas Skippoth has turned out his hoar, and is grown a very good husband, his lady lives with him hear...I sopose he wants money and soe weedles her." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1833, Kimball {{relocated}} {{his family}} to church headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio. He marched with Zion's Camp in 1834. From 1832 until 1840, Kimball served eight missions for the Church, requiring <b>him</b> to be <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> his family {{for months at a}} time.|$|R
25|$|His {{interest}} in the spiritual or transformational aspects of people's alien encounters, and his suggestion {{that the experience of}} alien contact itself may be more transcendent than physical in natureyet nonetheless realset <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> many of his contemporaries, such as Budd Hopkins, who advocated the physical reality of aliens.|$|E
25|$|But Beethoven's melodies, musical development, use of {{modulation}} and texture, and characterisation {{of emotion}} all set <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> his influences, and heightened the impact {{some of his}} early works made {{when they were first}} published. By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.|$|E
25|$|As a Vancouver artist {{getting his}} {{start in the}} 1980s and using lens-based media, Douglas is often {{associated}} with the Vancouver School of photoconceptualism. His use of video and film, in addition to photography, as well as his specific interests in cinematic history, forms and spatial concerns set <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> peers such as Jeff Wall.|$|E

50|$|Another {{technique}} {{learned from}} Otto Ketting is serialism, though this never really fascinated <b>him</b> (Schneeweisz 8). <b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> one work, namely Refrains (1968) for two piano's and orchestra, he never felt comfortable using serialistic techniques. He was to abandon this approach quickly (Oskamp 123).|$|R
25|$|Lamb {{argues that}} Paine's {{analysis}} {{of property rights}} marks a distinct contribution to political theory. His theory of property defends a libertarian concern with private ownership that shows an egalitarian commitment. Paine's new justification of property sets <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> previous theorists such as Hugo Grotius, Samuel von Pufendorf, and John Locke. It demonstrates Paine's commitment to foundational liberal values of individual freedom and moral equality.|$|E
25|$|Howard Hughes {{was among}} his first clients. After much {{difficulty}} finding steady stunt work, he accepted a particularly risky assignment, flying a Curtis-Wright CW-16K through a hangar {{with less than}} five feet of clearance off each wingtip for the 1932 film Air Mail. Mantz reportedly treated the challenge as an issue of thorough planning, which set <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> most of the pilots then flying stunts for the movies.|$|E
25|$|As {{he gained}} notoriety, Yoshitoshi {{was able to}} have ninety-five more of his designs {{published}} in 1865, mostly on military and historical subjects. Among these, two series would reveal Yoshitoshi’s creativity, originality, and imagination. The first series, Tsūzoku saiyūki ("A Modern Journey to the West"), is about a Chinese folk-hero. The second, Wakan hyaku monogatari ("One Hundred Stories of China and Japan"), illustrates traditional ghost stories. His imaginative prints set <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> any other artist of the time.|$|E
50|$|Her {{relationship}} with her father, and her feeling of connect/disconnect with him is shown in her poem, “History Shelves”. Her skepticism in feeling a part of <b>him</b> but <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> at the same time, and she is infatuated by his words and capability to convey, she reveals, “I feared that we were both cut from the same cloth,he with a monkey on his back, and I,a junkie for words I could not pronounce” (“History Shelves”).|$|R

Karmakar married Baani Rai, the daughter of businessman Brojendrolal Rai, and moved to Kolkata. Baani Karmakar was the youngest among her seven siblings. Radhu Karmakar and his family resided in Kolkata until in (1951) when he started working with Raj Kapoor in his film Awaara. Raj Kapoor found Karmakar's work commendable when he saw his night sequence photography and high contrast lighting in his last film Milan(1946). Karmakar's family soon moved to Mumbai.|$|R
25|$|Such appreciations have {{subsequently}} been rare, and the self-contained artificiality of Clair's films, {{his insistence}} on the meticulous preparation of an often literary script, and his preference for filming in studio sets rather than on location increasingly set <b>him</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> modern trends in film-making. The paradox of Clair's reputation has been further heightened by those commentators who have seen François Truffaut as the French cinema's true successor to Clair, notwithstanding the occasions of their mutual disdain.|$|E
25|$|She {{travelled}} regularly {{throughout the}} Territory as a photographer. Dean recounted some interesting and sometimes amusing incidents, like {{falling into a}} grave whilst trying to photograph funeral proceedings. When Albert Namatjira came to Darwin and saw the sea for the first time, and then painted it, {{she was asked to}} photograph <b>him.</b> <b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> the many weddings she also processed the many photographs that Bill Harney used for his stories of the Northern Territory.

25|$|Quaestiones quaedam philosophicae (Certain {{philosophical}} questions) is {{the name}} given {{to a set of}} notes that Isaac Newton kept for himself during his early years in Cambridge. They concern questions in the natural philosophy of the day that interested <b>him.</b> <b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> the light it throws on the formation of his own agenda for research, the major interest in these notes is the documentation of the unaided development of the scientific method in the mind of Newton, whereby every question is put to experimental test.|$|E
5000|$|A Reminder {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. In its review of A Reminder, Under The Gun stated, [...] "To summarize thus, A Reminder is an entertaining miniature collection, with some perfectly timed seasonal treats {{that ought to}} go down well for easy listening during the summer. There is evidence of a keener eye and ear in Bell’s approach that may let <b>him</b> stand <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> the rest in his future endeavors, though {{he has always been}} better than his teenybopper credentials may imply. A little cheesy perhaps, but a comforting listen." ...|$|R
5000|$|.....for {{starters}} Labbers {{has something}} {{no amount of}} studio trickery can create: soul. While the track's beat is reminiscent of many a Taio/Derülo/Ne-Yo number, his passionate performance and heartfelt lyrics about letting go of negativity set <b>him</b> strides <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> {{the current crop of}} robopop vocalists - and with a chorus that fuses gospel, funk and R&B, it certainly feels worthy of a eureka moment. Oh, and as if we couldn't be any more impressed, apparently there’s even a [...] "Cyndi Lauper-esque track" [...] waiting on his album. Bring. It. On..|$|R
5000|$|... "I loved him. He was {{the most}} real of all the tenors," [...] said Richard Bonynge. [...] "There was nothing phoney about his performances. Something always {{happened}} when he was onstage. You could believe in <b>him</b> utterly, <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> {{the fact that the}} voice itself was very, very beautiful. It had a quality that touched the heart, and you were never conscious of technique or anything. It was a very big lyric voice. But really lyric - very sort of silvery, but round, and affecting. It got to you." [...] Richard Bonynge.|$|R
