Since 1996, partial compensation for investors' losses has been offered - however, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> this only applied to state-owned banks such as Sberbank until 2003, offering them an unfair advantage.|$|E

25|$|A VAT, {{like most}} taxes, distorts {{what would have}} {{happened}} without it. Because the price for someone rises, the quantity of goods traded decreases. Correspondingly, some people are worse off by more than the government is made better off by tax income. That is, more is lost due to supply and demand shifts than is gained in tax. This is known as a deadweight loss. If the income lost by the economy is greater than the government's income; the tax is inefficient. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> a VAT and a Non-VAT have the same implications on the microeconomic model.|$|E

From the railway station of Göschenen to the tunnel's vertex the train lines ascend at an angle of 6‰ and descend at 2‰ from vertex to the village of Airolo.

Najib Abdul Razak denied all allegations as there were no concrete proof about him knowing Altantuya. Raja Petra retracted his allegation of the involvement of Najib Abdul Razak and Rosmah Mansor after the case were brought to court. Afraid of being prosecuted by the Malaysian courts for giving a false statement, Raja Petra fled to England, and left his wife and children behind. In addition, a former aide to Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Muhamad Rahimi Osman, claims that Sirul's family was enticed to make a false statement that Najib was involved in Altantuya's murder.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{alimentary}} {{system of}} Bothriolepis –which includes the organs involved in ingestion, digestion and removal of waste– {{can be described}} as simple and straight, unlike that of humans. It begins at the anterior end of the organism with a small mouth cavity located over the posterior area of the upper jaw plates. Posteriorly from the mouth, the alimentary system extends into a wider and dorso-ventrally flattened region called the pharynx, from which both the gills and lungs arise. The esophagus, which is also characterized as a dorso-ventrally flattened tube, extends from the mouth into the stomach and leads to a flattened ellipsoidal structure. This structure may be homologous to the anterior end of the intestine found in other fish. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the flatness of these structures may have been exaggerated when the fossil specimens experienced tectonic deformation through geologic time. The intestine begins narrowly on the anterior end, expands transversely and then again narrows posteriorly towards the cylindrical rectum, which terminates just within the posterior end of the trunk carapace. While the alimentary system is primitive in nature and lacks an expanded stomach region, it is specialized by an independently acquired complex spiral valve, comparable to that in elasmobranchs and many bony fish and similar to that found in some sharks. A single fold of tissue rolled upon its own axis forms this specialized spiral valve.|$|E

25|$|Like other settled, agrarian {{societies}} in history, {{those in the}} Indian subcontinent have been attacked by nomadic tribes throughout its long history. In evaluating the impact of Islam on the sub-continent, one must note that the northwestern subcontinent was a frequent target of tribes raiding from Central Asia. In that sense, the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions were not dissimilar {{to those of the}} earlier invasions during the 1st millennium. What does however, make the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions different is that unlike the preceding invaders who assimilated into the prevalent social system, the successful Muslim conquerors retained their Islamic identity and created new legal and administrative systems that challenged and usually in many cases superseded the existing systems of social conduct and ethics, even influencing the non-Muslim rivals and common masses to a large extent, though the non-Muslim population was left to their own laws and customs. They also introduced new cultural codes that in some ways were very different from the existing cultural codes. This led to the rise of a new Indian culture which was mixed in nature, though different from both the ancient Indian culture and later westernised modern Indian culture. At the same time <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> overwhelming majority of Muslims in India are Indian natives converted to Islam. This factor also {{played an important role in}} the synthesis of cultures.|$|E
25|$|In the {{simplest}} terms, collective memory {{can be understood}} as the memory of a group of people, and is usually associated with the passing of that memory from generation to generation. However, there are many nuances to this idea; it must also be considered in terms of the processes of remembering and forgetting events. Thus, when a typical emotional event is socially shared and propagates to perhaps 50 other people, that event becomes a collective memory for that group or community of people. When the emotional event is particularly intense, the event would be expected to undergo an even larger diffusion. Furthermore, the more intense the emotional event is, the more rapid the diffusion should be and should reach more people in a shorter amount of time. This is especially true for events that are shared via mass media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, internet, etc. In this case, the collective memory is no longer confined to a local population, but instead can become that of a regional, national, or even international population. Besides the propagation of a single person’s emotional event, many people can simultaneously experience a single national emotional event, such as the disappearing of an important person. Such an event also becomes part of a collectively shared memory. However, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> each person still has their own personal memory of the event, such as where they were when they experienced the event, what they were doing, etc.|$|E
500|$|In June 1918, Williams {{was made}} a brevet {{lieutenant}} colonel and commander of the RAF's 40th (Army) Wing, which was operating in Palestine. It comprised his former No.1 Squadron and three British units. As a Dominion officer, Williams {{found that he was}} not permitted to [...] "exercise powers of punishment over British personnel", leading to him being temporarily [...] "granted a supplementary commission in the Royal Air Force". Augmented by a giant Handley Page bomber, his forces took part in the Battle of Armageddon, the final offensive in Palestine, where they inflicted [...] "wholesale destruction" [...] on Turkish columns. Of 40th Wing's actions at Wadi Fara on 21September 1918, Williams wrote: [...] "The Turkish Seventh Army ceased to exist and <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> this was entirely the result of attack from the air." [...] He also sent Captain Ross Smith in the Handley Page, accompanied by two Bristol Fighters, to aid Major T. E. Lawrence's Arab army north of Amman when it was harassed by German aircraft operating from Deraa. In November, Williams was appointed temporary commander of the Palestine Brigade, which comprised his previous command, the 40th (Army) Wing, and 5th (Corps) Wing. His service in the theatre later saw him awarded the Order of the Nahda by the King of the Hejaz. Twice mentioned in despatches, {{by the end of the}} war Williams had established himself, in the words of RAAF historian Alan Stephens, as [...] "the AFC's rising star".|$|E
