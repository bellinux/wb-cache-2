40|$|AbstractBeside well chosen process {{parameters}} a geometrical <b>joining</b> <b>partner</b> design {{suitable for}} laser transmission welding and adequate clamping pressure appliance {{is necessary to}} form high quality welds. Amongst other clamping techniques Dual Clamping Devices (DCD) are a promising approach to fulfill the process needs and {{to get to a}} robust and also fail safe clamping. When using DCD the laser beam has to pass thin non transmitting bars while a weld seam is formed. So the laser beam is partial refracted, reflected and absorbed. Here the influences of the bars onto the laser beam intensity distribution behind the bars rather in the interaction zone of the laser beam and the two <b>joining</b> <b>partners</b> are investigated. Welding experiments with DCD are carried out and discussed. Based on the experimental results thermal process simulations are performed, to get a deeper knowledge about the effect of the bars onto the spatially and temporally changing temperature field within the <b>joining</b> <b>partners...</b>|$|R
40|$|Within {{the plastic}} {{industry}} laser transmission welding {{ranks among the}} most important joining techniques and opens up new application areas continuously. So far, a big disadvantage of the process {{was the fact that the}} <b>joining</b> <b>partners</b> need different optical properties. Since thermoplastics are transparent for the radiation of conventional beam sources (800 - 1100 nm) the absorbance of one of the <b>joining</b> <b>partners</b> has to be enhanced by adding an infrared absorber (IR-absorber). Until recently, welding of absorber-free parts has not been possible. New diode lasers provide a broad variety of wavelengths which allows exploiting intrinsic absorption bands of thermoplastics. The use of a proper wavelength in combination with special optics enables laser welding of two optically identical polymer parts without absorbers which can be utilized in a large number of applications primarily in the medical and food industry, where the use of absorbers usually entails costly and time-consuming authorization processes. In this paper some aspects of the process are considered as the influence of the focal position, which is crucial when both <b>joining</b> <b>partners</b> have equal optical properties. After a theoretical consideration, an evaluation is carried out based on welding trials with polycarbonate (PC). Further aspects such as gap bridging capability and the influence of thickness of the upper <b>joining</b> <b>partner</b> are investigated as well...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Relational index structures, as for {{instance}} the Relational Interval Tree or the Linear Quadtree, support efficient processing of queries {{on top of}} existing object-relational database systems. Furthermore, there exist effective and efficient models to estimate the selectivity and the I/O cost in order to guide the cost-based optimizer whether and how to include these index structures into the execution plan. By design, the models immediately fit to common extensible indexing/optimization frameworks, and their implementations exploit the built-in statistics facilities of the database server. In this paper, we show how these statistics {{can also be used}} for accelerating the access methods themselves by reducing the number of generated <b>join</b> <b>partners</b> which results in fewer logical reads and consequently improves the overall runtime. We cut down on the number of <b>join</b> <b>partners</b> by grouping different <b>join</b> <b>partners</b> together according to a statistic driven grouping algorithm. Our experiments on an Oracle 9 i database yield an average speed-up between 20 % and 10, 000 % for spatial collision queries on the Relational Interval Tree and on the Relational Quadtree...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe laser brazing {{of steel}} sheets is widely applied in car-body manufacturing. The {{critical}} {{value for the}} strength of the joint is the minimal connection width between the two sheets. However, this value is depending on the feed rate and power of the laser and the feed rate and preheating current of the filler wire used. Furthermore, the wetting behavior of the brazing solder is affected by the surface properties of the <b>joining</b> <b>partners</b> and is thus prone to errors. Currently, mostly destructive testing is used to evaluate the connection state. Therefore, we studied a novel optical measurement technique which is capable of remotely measuring oscillations of the <b>joining</b> <b>partners.</b> In the proposed study, we show how the oscillations are connected to the process behavior and the fusion area and how the setup might be applied as a post- and in-process measurement system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLaser {{transmission}} welding is {{a well-known}} joining technology for thermoplastics. Because {{of the needs of}} lightweight, cost effective and green production nowadays injection molded parts usually have to be welded. These parts are made out of semi-crystalline thermoplastics which are filled to a high amount with glass fibers. This leads to higher absorption and more scattering within the upper <b>joining</b> <b>partner</b> and hasa negative influence onto the welding process. Here a ray tracing model capable of considering every single glass fiber is introduced. Hence spatially not equally distributed glass fibers can be taken into account. Therefore the model is able to calculate in detail the welding laser intensity distribution after transmission through the upper <b>joining</b> <b>partner.</b> Data gained by numerical simulation is compared to data obtained by laser radiation scattering experiments. Thus observed deviation is quantified and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{pulse welding}} {{is based on}} the high {{velocity}} impact of two <b>joining</b> <b>partners</b> and a promising technology especially for the joining of dissimilar metallic components. Under proper conditions, a solid-state bond forms at the overlapping interface that is typically at least as strong as the weaker base material. However, high thermal and mechanical loads act on the tool coil and provoke a limited lifetime. Furthermore, the prevalent magnetic fields obstruct a comprehensive process monitoring with conventional means. In this manuscript, approaches for reducing the load on the tool coil without compromising the joint quality are presented. This is obtained by an adaption of the coil geometry and the application of a boundary layer on one of the <b>joining</b> <b>partners.</b> Moreover, a new measuring system taking advantage of the naturally occurring impact flash is evaluated and successfully applied for the process development and detection of process disturbances...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic Pulse Welding (MPW) by {{electromagnetic}} compression is a solid-state {{welding technique}} favorable {{for the creation}} of strong metallurgical bonds between both similar and dissimilar metals. The process is based on the plastic deformation of one of the <b>joining</b> <b>partners</b> and the subsequent high velocity collision with the other <b>joining</b> <b>partner.</b> Due to the absence of external heat, brittle intermetallic phases and other heat induced defects are largely avoided which makes the process especially suitable for multi-material joints applied in lightweight design. However, the stationary part must be able to withstand the harsh impact without inadmissibly permanent deformation. This is why mostly solid cylinders are used as parent parts, limiting the lightweight potential. The paper focuses on the MPW of aluminum (ENAW- 6060) to steel (C 45) tubes with and without supporting mandrel inside of the parent part. Experimental studies were performed in which the wall thickness of the parent steel part was reduced successively. The deformation behavior of both the flyer and parent parts was recorded during the experiments by a periscope-style photonic Doppler velocimetry (PDV) setup. It was found that defect-free MPW of aluminum tubes on steel tubes without supporting mandrel is generally possible but strongly depends on the characteristics of the electromagnetic pulse due to the initiation of elastic waves that may deteriorate the weld quality. Critical values for the parent wall thickness were deduced for various pulse shapes and <b>joining</b> <b>partner</b> geometries and the feasibility of supporting elements was investigated...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLaser {{transmission}} welding is {{an established}} single-stage plastic joining process, which enables hermetically sealed joints under the workpiece surface. The process requires <b>joining</b> <b>partners</b> with proper degrees of transmission and absorption to the processing wavelength. For reaching a stable process an in-process quality assurance is very valuable. Current monitoring systems {{have a limited}} usage, as no quantitative information of the weld itself is obtained without its destruction. In medical and pharmaceutical applications a weld with leakage is e. g. unacceptable. The main objective {{of this paper is}} the presentation of the optical coherence tomography as a tool for the quality assurance in laser transmission welding. This approach enables the measurement of any residual gap, weld geometry, internal pores and leaks.
