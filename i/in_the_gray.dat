On July 26, Southside politicians attempted to force a vote through the Gray Commission which endorsed the Stanley plan (as redrafted by Almond), but the vote failed.

25|$|The classic histologic {{appearance}} is spongiform change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> matter: {{the presence of}} many round vacuoles from one to 50 micrometres in the neuropil, in all six cortical layers in the cerebral cortex or with diffuse involvement of the cerebellar molecular layer.

25|$|Abnormal {{expression}} of sulfatide {{is linked to}} several neurological disorders. As stated before, {{one of the major}} neurological disorders is Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, which is caused by elevated levels of sulfatide, leading to the progressive loss of myelin as a result of sulfatide accumulation. High levels of sulfatide <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> matter in the cerebellum and in the superior frontal lobe have been associated with Parkinson's disease. Additionally, accumulation of sulfatide in neurons causes audiogenic seizures, which {{have been shown to be}} lethal in mouse models. On the other hand, reduced levels of sulfatide in the cerebral gray and white matter have been associated with Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

50|$|The {{extension}} of the railroad from Aberdeen to Hoquiam, beginning in 1898, contributed to the continued importance of logging and lumber <b>in</b> Hoquiam. <b>The</b> importance of logging and related products continued to be relevant to Hoquiam’s economy, and in 1927, a pulp mill was established under <b>the</b> name of <b>Grays</b> Harbor Pulp Company. A year later, a Pennsylvania company- the Hammerhill Paper Company- became interested in Grays Harbor Pulp Company. When the Pennsylvania company bought stock <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grays</b> Harbor Pulp Company, <b>the</b> <b>Grays</b> Harbor pulp Company built a paper mill and became <b>the</b> <b>Grays</b> Harbor Pulp & Paper Company. <b>In</b> 1936, <b>the</b> <b>Grays</b> Harbor Pulp and Paper Company merged with Rayonier Incorporated, a company which used {{a certain kind of}} pulp to produce rayon.|$|R

25|$|Osborne's first silent {{film was}} <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Gray</b> Brother, {{but the film}} did not have {{distribution}} and was never released. From March through December 1928, she appeared in the Florenz Ziegfeld musical version of The Three Musketeers. It was after her performance that Douglas Fairbanks Sr. offered her a role in his last silent film, The Iron Mask (1929), made as a sequel to his 1921 film The Three Musketeers. Rather than accept the offer, she chose to remain in New York City and continue her career. She signed with Paramount Studios in 1931 and was assigned to character roles, but left to sign with Warner Studios to get better roles. She then left Warners and signed a 3-year contract with Radio Pictures. She alternated between film and stage roles {{for the rest of}} her career.|$|E
25|$|In Alzheimer's disease, {{sulfatide}} in {{the brain}} tissue decreases tremendously, starting {{in the early stages}} of the disease. In the mild stages of Alzheimer's disease, the loss of sulfatide can be up to 50% in the white matter and up to 90% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> matter {{in the brain}}. Sulfatide concentration in the cerebral spinal fluid is also lower in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The characteristic loss of neuronal function associated with Alzheimer's disease occurs via the loss of neurons and synapses, and the deficit is lipid class specific to sulfatides. When comparing sulfatide depletion to other neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease is the only case in which sulfatide is so dramatically depleted; in dementia no marked sulfatide depletion is observed, while in Parkinson's disease, sulfatide levels are dramatically elevated, and multiple sclerosis patients only have a moderate sulfatide depletion. Additionally, the loss of sulfatide has been observed to only occur at the very beginning of the disease while at more severe stages, minimal additional sulfatide loss occurs.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} {{elemental}} tin (Sn), which is malleable near ambient temperatures but is brittle when cooled. This change in mechanical properties due to existence {{of its two}} major allotropes, α- and β-tin. The two allotropes that are encountered at normal pressure and temperature, α-tin and β-tin, are more commonly known as gray tin and white tin respectively. Two more allotropes, γ and σ, exist at temperatures above 161°C and pressures above several GPa. White tin is metallic, and is the stable crystalline form at or above room temperature. Below 13.2°C, tin exists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> form, which has a diamond cubic crystal structure, similar to diamond, silicon or germanium. Gray tin has no metallic properties at all, is a dull gray powdery material, and has few uses, other than a few specialized semiconductor applications. Although the α–β transformation temperature of tin is nominally 13.2°C, impurities (e.g. Al, Zn, etc.) lower the transition temperature well below 0°C, and upon addition of Sb or Bi the transformation may not occur at all.|$|E

500|$|Goodman Beaver was a {{stand-in}} for Kurtzman {{himself in}} this semi-autobiographical tale. [...] At {{this point in}} his career, Kurtzman had had several negative experiences with publishers, and he used this story to satirize the corrupting influence of capitalism and power. [...] Kurtzman's memories of his time at Timely Comics were a strong influence on the Schlock Publications he portrayed; [...] Timely publisher Martin Goodman was Kurtzman's model for the publisher in the story. [...] Kurtzman also used Burt Lancaster as his model for the editor of the men's magazine in the story, and Hugh Hefner was his model for the editor of the [...] "girlie" [...] magazine. [...] As Goodman Beaver did in the story, early in his career Kurtzman worked making crossword puzzles for Goodman. [...] The title is an amalgamation of three bestselling 1950s novels: Executive Suite (1952) by Cameron Hawley, [...] The Man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gray</b> Flannel Suit (1955) by Sloan Wilson, and [...] The Organization Man (1956) by William H.

500|$|His {{opinions}} {{have also}} proved lasting in fields of commercial law. Law students studying torts often encounter Hand's 1947 decision for United States v. Carroll Towing Co., which gave {{a formula for}} determining liability in cases of negligence. Hand's interpretations of complex Internal Revenue Codes, which he called [...] "a thicket of verbiage", {{have been used as}} guides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> area between individual and corporate taxes. In an opinion sometimes seen as condoning tax avoidance, Hand stated in 1947 that [...] "there is nothing sinister in so arranging one's affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible". He was referring to reporting of individual income through corporate tax forms for legitimate business reasons. In tax decisions, as in all statutory cases, Hand studied the intent of the original legislation. His opinions became a valuable guide to tax administrators. Hand's landmark decision in United States v. Aluminum Company of America in 1945 influenced the development of antitrust law. His decisions in patent, copyright, and admiralty cases have contributed to the development of law in those fields.|$|E

2500|$|Polydendrocytes (also {{known as}} NG2 cells, NG2 glia, or {{oligodendrocyte}} progenitor cells) are process-bearing glial cells (neuroglia) in the mammalian {{central nervous system}} (CNS) that are identified by {{the expression of the}} NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG4) [...] and the alpha receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFRA). [...] They are distinct from other cell populations such as neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and neural stem cells and are recognized as the fourth major glial cell type in the mammalian CNS. [...] Studies have implicated polydendrocytes in many cellular and physiological processes. [...] Polydendrocytes in the postnatal mouse CNS and those grown in culture generate oligodendrocytes, and thus they are often equated with oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). [...] Under some culture conditions, polydendrocytes give rise to astrocytes. [...] A subpopulation of polydendrocytes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> matter of the embryonic CNS also generates protoplasmic astrocytes. [...] In addition, polydendrocytes express receptors for various neurotransmitters and undergo membrane depolarization when they receive synaptic inputs from neurons.|$|E
