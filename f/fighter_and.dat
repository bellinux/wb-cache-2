5|$|Arafat {{remains a}} {{controversial}} figure. The {{majority of the}} Palestinian people view him as a heroic freedom <b>fighter</b> <b>and</b> martyr who symbolized the national aspirations of his people. Conversely, most Israelis came to regard him as an unrepentant terrorist, while Palestinian rivals, including Islamists and several PLO leftists, often denounced him for being corrupt or too submissive in his concessions to the Israeli government.|$|E
5|$|Army Wing {{aircraft}} {{were assigned}} to carry out strategic reconnaissances, to report on Ottoman reserves well behind their lines, to carry out daily photography, and to conduct air raids. <b>Fighter</b> <b>and</b> bombing squadrons were established for these purposes while the Corps Squadrons were attached to the two infantry corps carried out artillery and contact patrols, along with tactical reconnaissance.|$|E

500|$|Hōshō had {{a normal}} {{capacity}} of fifteen aircraft, {{subject to the}} limitations of her hangars. She was first commissioned with an air group of nine Mitsubishi 1MF (Type 10) <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> three to six Mitsubishi B1M3 (Type 13) torpedo bombers. In 1928, the fighters were replaced by the A1N1 (Type 3). Three years later the air group consisted of Nakajima A2N (Type 90) <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> Mitsubishi B2M (Type 89) torpedo bombers. In 1938 Nakajima A4N (Type 95) <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> Yokosuka B3Y (Type 92) bombers flew from the ship. In 1940 the air group was modernized with Mitsubishi A5M (Type 96) [...] "Claude" [...] <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> Yokosuka B4Y1 (Type 96) [...] "Jean" [...] bombers.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{types of}} aircraft are immediately available: <b>fighters,</b> bombers, <b>and</b> scouts. Later in the game, when technology levels have advanced, jet <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> long-range bombers become available. Aircraft carriers can be fitted to allow jets once the technology levels are sufficient; the modified carrier will only carry jet <b>fighters,</b> <b>and</b> not normal <b>fighters.</b> Long-range bombers {{can only be}} launched from land bases.|$|R

All Dolgorsüren brothers have strong backgrounds in Mongolian wrestling.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the Korean War air power had been {{supplemented}} by the introduction of the jet engine, which allowed <b>fighter</b> <b>and</b> bomber aircraft to fly faster. As with their World War II predecessors, the newer jet aircraft proved capable of providing close air support for ground based troops, and were instrumental in aiding UN ground forces during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Despite these additions, {{the ship}} was still felt to be too {{vulnerable}} to plunging fire and Renown was refitted in Rosyth between 1 February and mid-April 1917 with additional horizontal armour, weighing approximately , added to the decks over the magazines and over the steering gear. Flying-off platforms were fitted on 'B' and 'X' turrets in early 1918. One <b>fighter</b> <b>and</b> a reconnaissance aircraft were carried.|$|E
50|$|With a {{strength}} of twelve, the carrier {{is a strong}} water-based unit on its own but its main purpose is to carry <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> helicopters, of which it can hold up to 15 at a time. <b>Fighters</b> <b>and</b> helicopters are also refueled when on a carrier. A carrier with several fighters on board {{can be an effective}} way to quickly explore unexplored areas. A carrier moving into a city and out again will bring <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> helicopters in the city with it till capacity.|$|R
25|$|Heavy {{fighting}} resumed on 29 March 2007, {{ending a}} week-long ceasefire between tribal <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> foreign militants. According to initial reports, tribesmen attacked a checkpoint manned by former Soviet Uzbek <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> captured two of them. The clashes also left one tribal <b>fighter</b> dead <b>and</b> three wounded. The following day, a senior Pakistani official announced that 52 {{people were killed}} {{during the past two}} days; 45 of them were Uzbeks and the rest tribesmen. One of Maulvi Nazir's aides put the death toll at 35 Uzbeks <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> 10 tribal <b>fighters.</b> However, residents in the area said that the death toll on both sides was inflated.|$|R

5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force's Air Combat Group (ACG) is {{the group}} which administers the RAAF's <b>fighter</b> <b>and</b> bomber aircraft.

5|$|We {{destroyed}} the aircraft and all munitions, everything. I {{sat in my}} <b>fighter</b> <b>and</b> fired the guns into the woods where all the fuel had been dropped, and then jumped out. We destroyed twenty-five perfectly good fighters. They {{would be nice to}} have in museums now.|$|E
5|$|Between 15 and 20 August, the U.S. {{carriers}} {{covered the}} delivery of <b>fighter</b> <b>and</b> bomber aircraft to the newly opened Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. This small, hard-won airfield was a critical point in the entire island chain, and both military sides strategically considered that control of the airbase offered potential control of the local battle area airspace. In fact, Henderson Field and the aircraft based upon it soon resulted in telling effects on the movement of Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands and in the attrition of Japanese air forces in the South Pacific Area. Historically, Allied control of Henderson Field became the key factor in the entire battle for Guadalcanal.|$|E

5|$|Despite these additions, {{the ship}} was still felt to be too {{vulnerable}} to plunging fire and Repulse was refitted in Rosyth between 10 November 1916 and 29 January 1917 with additional horizontal armour, weighing approximately , added to the decks over the magazines and over the steering gear. Repulse was the first capital ship fitted with a flying-off platform when an experimental one was fitted on 'B' turret {{in the autumn of}} 1917. Squadron Leader Frederick Rutland took off in a Sopwith Pup on 1 October. Another platform was built on 'Y' turret and Rutland successfully took off from it on 8 October. One <b>fighter</b> <b>and</b> a reconnaissance aircraft were normally carried.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the flyoff competition, the XSO2U-1 {{was used}} as a general utility {{aircraft}} and hack by the Navy, before being supplied to the Ranger Engine Corporation in July 1942 for use in tests of the V-770 engine. These tests were intended to assist in debugging the engine for the Bell XP-77 lightweight <b>fighter</b> <b>and</b> Edo XOSE floatplane, but the V-770 remained troublesome, and after two years of testing the XSO2U was returned to the Navy. Having no further use for the aircraft, the XSO2U-1 was removed from the Navy's rolls on 6 July 1944, being subsequently scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Further {{proposals}} {{based on}} the delta wing resulted in {{two versions of the}} design known as C104: the single engine C104/4 and twin-engined C104/2. The designs were otherwise similar, using a low-mounted delta-wing; the primary advantages of the C104/2 were a larger overall size which offered a much larger internal weapons bay, at the time a cutting-edge feature in a <b>fighter,</b> <b>and</b> gave it twin-engine reliability. The proposals were submitted to the RCAF in June 1952.|$|E
