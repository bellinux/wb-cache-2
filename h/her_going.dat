[...] Douglas MacDowell suggests that originally Apollodoros intended to bring the case himself.

[...] He spends most of the speech going over Neaera's life as a hetaera, from her purchase by Nikarete to <b>her</b> <b>going</b> to live with Stephanos, and the failure of Phano's two marriages. He demonstrates that Neaera was not an Athenian citizen, though he [...] "failed to establish conclusively" [...] that Neaera was married to Stephanos, or that she passed her children off as Athenian citizens.|$|E
