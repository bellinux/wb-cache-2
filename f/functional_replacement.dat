40|$|Abstract Background Comparison of {{metabolic}} networks {{is typically}} performed {{based on the}} organisms' enzyme contents. This approach disregards <b>functional</b> <b>replacements</b> as well as orthologies that are misannotated. Direct comparison {{of the structure of}} metabolic networks can circumvent these problems. Results Metabolic networks are naturally represented as directed hypergraphs {{in such a way that}} metabolites are nodes and enzyme-catalyzed reactions form (hyper) edges. The familiar operations from set algebra (union, intersection, and difference) form a natural basis for both the pairwise comparison of networks and identification of distinct metabolic features of a set of algorithms. We report here on an implementation of this approach and its application to the procaryotes. Conclusion We demonstrate that metabolic networks contain valuable phylogenetic information by comparing phylogenies obtained from network comparisons with 16 S RNA phylogenies. The algebraic approach to metabolic networks is suitable to study metabolic innovations in two sets of organisms, free living microbes and Pyrococci, as well as obligate intracellular pathogens. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} and diffusion of morphogens is a mechanism widely {{used to explain}} many spatial patterns in physics, chemistry and developmental biology. However, because experimental control is limited in most biological systems, it is often unclear what mechanisms account for the biological patterns that arise. Here, we study a biological model of cultured vascular mesenchymal cells (VMCs), which normally self-organize into aggregates that form into labyrinthine configurations. We use an experimental control and a mathematical model that includes reacting and diffusing morphogens and a third variable reflecting local cell density. With direct measurements showing that cell motility was increased ninefold and threefold by inhibiting either Rho kinase or non-muscle myosin-II, respectively, our experimental results and mathematical modelling demonstrate that increased motility alters the multicellular pattern of the VMC cultures, from labyrinthine to a pattern of periodic holes. These results suggest implications for the tissue engineering of <b>functional</b> <b>replacements</b> for trabecular or spongy tissue such as endocardium and bone. © 2012 The Royal Society...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical forces {{transmitted}} through the cellular microenvironment are critically important for tissue development, homeostasis, and degeneration, particularly for tissues in the musculoskeletal system that play primary load bearing roles. When these tissues degenerate, their limited healing capacity has lead many to propose tissue engineering strategies {{in order to}} provide <b>functional</b> <b>replacements.</b> While native tissue structural and mechanical benchmarks are commonly used to quantify and validate outcomes for tissue engineering and to refine experimental approaches, these same benchmarks have not yet been extended to the cellular and sub-cellular level.

With this motivation, and building on an established biomaterial framework for engineering fibrocartilagenous tissues, this thesis further refines macro-scale functional benchmarks and defines new micro-scale benchmarks that are operative at the cellular and sub-cellular level. In doing so, we identify a number of structural attributes of the cellular cytoskeleton and its attachments to the nucleus that are important for mechanotransduction. In normal functioning tissues, maintenance of phenotype in mechanically active microenvironments requires appropriately tuned mechanotransduction machinery. Understanding how these sub-cellular mechanoactive species (including the cytoskeleton, the nucleus, and nuclear connectivity) change with differentiation and development, as well as their role in mechanical signaling, will be of primary importance for the success of tissue engineering strategies. ...|$|R
