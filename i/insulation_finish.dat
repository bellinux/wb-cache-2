40|$|In North America, the {{exterior}} finish of wood-frame house walls usually {{consists of a}} siding, a water resistive barrier, and an oriented strandboard (OSB) sheathing. In Europe, {{the exterior}} finish uses the External Thermal Insulation Composite System attached to a gypsum board sheathing. This study was performed to compare the hygrothermal performance of American and European walls by using a finite-element model. Analysis showed that the European wall has better thermal performance {{mainly because of the}} heat-insulating ability of the expanded polysterene (EPS) layer. But when the EPS was reduced to the same thickness as the siding used in American construction, the thermal performance of the European wall did not fare any better than the American structure. The resistance of the European wall to moisture damage was also better than the American walls. One reason for this is the high diffusion resistance of the EPS. But this same high diffusion resistance works to the detriment of an Exterior <b>Insulation</b> <b>Finish</b> System (EIFS) wall if water is able to infiltrate the structure. When water leakage is present, the water content of the OSB in the EIFS wall reaches levels that make it vulnerable to mold growth and fungal decay...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} laboratory testing {{on the performance}} of wall claddings using direct-applied (DEFS) and exterior <b>insulation</b> <b>finish</b> systems (EIFS) that incorporate water management features into their design and construc-tion. The work presented in this paper is a continuation of earlier work conducted by the Institute for Research in Construction (IRC) of the National Research Council, Canada (NRCC) and the United States Gypsum Company (USG) evaluating the water penetration and moisture performance of barrier EIFS clad walls (Brown et al., 1997). Direct-applied exterior finish systems (DEFS) are exterior wall claddings that use a water durable substrate, typically cement board, mechanically fastened to the wall framing over a sheathing membrane. A cementitious basecoat and textured acrylic synthetic stucco finish is then applied directly over the substrate. Insulation for the DEFS system is in the stud cavity. EIFS systems use a layer of foam insulation applied over the wall substrate, with basecoat and finish applied over the foam. The performance of three water managed wall cladding designs in protecting wood framed construction from water intrusion by wind-driven rain is described. Three different drainage systems were evaluated. Performance measures evaluated in-cluded cladding airtightness, pressure equalization potential, and water drainage under wind-driven rain conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the results of work performed to enhance understanding of water penetration and moisture characteristics of barrier Exterior <b>Insulation</b> <b>Finish</b> Systems (EIFS) clad walls. The investigation was prompted by recent failures of barrier EIFS clad walls on houses in the Wilmington, North Caro-lina area. The objective was to determine the cause of the problem and {{gain a better understanding of}} water penetration and moisture transport in these systems. The study included a field investigation, laboratory experiments, and computer simulation. The experimental results indicate that barrier EIFS clad walls are prone to leak in areas around penetrations and allow water to enter into the wall cavity. A drainage cavity wall was also tested, and observed to perform well, managing water around penetrations and preventing leakage into the wall cavity. The computer simulation indicates that barrier EIFS clad walls in Wilmington have low moisture tolerance due to slow drying rates. In conclusion, barrier EIFS clad walls do not provide effective management of rain penetration. As such, in-service performance is unpredictable and unreliable. In con-trast to barrier EIFS clad walls, walls using a drained cavity approach were shown to provide good control of rain penetration.

Unlike more traditional materials, such as wood siding or cement-based stucco, a critical flaw of the new materials is that any water or moisture that penetrates into the system, either through cracks in the surface (caused by thermal expansion or damage), unsealed joints, or incorrect flashings, becomes trapped inside the wall, potentially causing deterioration, rot, and mould.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} basic methods walls control water intrusion: {{moisture}} storage, drained cladding, or face-sealed cladding. Moisture storage {{is typical of}} stone and brick mass-wall buildings where moisture is absorbed and released by {{the walls of the}} structure itself. Drained cladding also known as screened walls acknowledges moisture will penetrate the cladding so a moisture barrier such as housewrap or felt paper inside the cladding provides a second line of defense and sometimes a drainage plane or air gap allows a path for the moisture to drain down through and exit the wall. Sometimes ventilation is provided in addition to the drainage plane such as in rainscreen construction. Face-sealed also called barrier wall or perfect barrier cladding relies on maintaining a leak-free surface of the cladding. Examples of face sealed cladding are the early exterior <b>insulation</b> <b>finishing</b> systems, structural glazing, metal clad panels, and corrugated metal.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} reasons that some {{buildings}} from the 1990s were leaky. A major one was {{the increase in the}} use of cladding systems such as fibre cement sheet and EIPS (Externally Insulated Plaster System) that relied on a paint finish as the primary defence against water ingress. This system is very similar to Exterior <b>insulation</b> <b>finishing</b> system (or EIFS). Such cladding systems typically allowed for little construction or thermal movement so that fine cracks that appeared insignificant, and would have been relatively insignificant in traditional claddings such as weatherboard, allowed continuous ingress of moisture into the framing. [...] These causes, combined with the reduced air movement through the prevalence of sheet cladding or sheet insulating materials for the monolithic look cladding, resulted in very damp conditions which are ideal for rot. A further exacerbating factor that resulted in more significant damage from the leaks, was the change to the New Zealand Standard for Timber Treatment in 1995, allowing the use of untreated Pinus radiata timber for wall framing. As this timber has little natural resistance to rot when wet, damage occurs more quickly.|$|R
40|$|One {{purpose of}} this work was to examine if a {{modification}} of the exterior <b>insulation</b> <b>finishing</b> system can lower the number of outer walls damaged by damp. The modification is the cut of the cellular plastic which is 45 degrees instead of a horizontal cut. One other purpose was; is cellular plastic or mineral wool better as insulation to minimize the dampness {{in this type of}} outer walls? A third purpose was to examine if there is any difference of dampness in the outer walls if using a gravel bed or concrete stones next to the outer wall. To examine these three purposes a laboratory experiment with three test walls with an exterior <b>insulation</b> <b>finishing</b> system was built. The difference between the three walls was the insulation. One wall was built with mineral wool with a horizontal cut, one with cellular plastic with a horizontal cut and the third with cellular plastic with a cut of 45 degrees. Simulations of pelting rain and measurements of dampness were carried out for 21 days. The measurements were taken at the same time every evening. After 21 days small samples of tree from the walls was weight, dried in an oven and then weight again to get the quantity of moisture in the samples before they were dried. A diffusion calculation of two outer walls, one with cellular plastic and one with mineral wool, was completed to examine the difference between the relative humidity in the walls. An identical calculation without a plastic film was executed too. The result of the calculations showed a minimal difference in the walls built with a plastic film. When the film was removed the result presented critical values. The result of the laboratory experiment indicates that the test wall with the cut of 45 degrees is better than the walls with a horizontal cut of the insulation. The differences were minimal but possible to read. Some critical, too high, values regarding the moisture content in wood were found and they came from the sills in the walls that had insulation with horizontal cuts. Of the two insulation types the result of calculations and laboratory experiment shows a minimal difference but they both indicates a better result for the mineral wool. The conclusion of this work indicates that cellular plastic with a 45 degree cut is slightly better than the horizontal cut. The comparison of cellular plastic and mineral wool indicates that the mineral wool is better. Another conclusion of this work is that the material on the ground next to the outer wall did not alter the dampness in the wall...|$|R

30|$|Light {{timber frame}} {{construction}} are typically encapsulated within non-combustible gypsum plasterboard to offer sound <b>insulation,</b> surface <b>finishes</b> and protection from fire. Given the section size of typical 2 ”[*]×[*] 4 ” [50  mm[*]×[*] 100  mm] and 2 ”[*]×[*] 6 ” [50  mm[*]×[*] 150  mm] stud framing members, the inherent fire resistance of the studs alone is effectively negligible, as the members are small. Hence, unprotected, or exposed, light timber frames provide little structural fire resistance.

40|$|One {{of the new}} {{trends in}} the {{building}} construction industry is designing for environmental-friendly buildings, a. k. a. Green Buildings. Planners and designers are therefore trying to accommodate these new environmental practices into existing design criteria. Selection of building materials {{is one of the}} key decisions need to be made by building designers. However, due to the strong influence of costs on the building industry, making material-selection decisions solely based on their environmental impacts could be both inadequate and impractical. These factors therefore complicate the building design process, especially pertaining to material selection. Accordingly, the present study is aimed at providing much needed support to the decision-making process of residential building design. To this end, the study evaluates and analyzes the environmental and cost impacts of several building assemblies and material alternatives for the building exterior walls. The Technique of Order Preference Similar to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used to evaluate and rank different material alternatives used in walls based on their environmental impacts. In addition, the environmental data used in this study were extracted from commonly used databases that considered the lifecycle impacts of different residential building materials and assemblies. The environmental and cost impacts of several exterior wall assemblies are then aggregated for different building material alternatives to allow for an objective comparison of these assemblies and facilitate proper building design decision- making. The study results show that wood and exterior <b>insulation</b> <b>finishing</b> system (EIFS) provided the best environmental performance of wall structural and wall finishing materials, respectively.

50|$|The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission {{embarked}} on a seismic retrofit, designed to bring the Sports Arena up to 21st century seismic standards. In order to reinforce the existing 316700 sq ft structure, a series of steel braced frames were connected to the existing concrete structural system at both the arena and loge levels of the building. To provide a solid footing for these steel frames, portions of the arena floor had to be excavated, then reinforced to provide extra strength. Once the steel frames were fitted and incorporated into the existing structure between existing support columns, concrete was then re-poured into the area. The original crown of the arena, {{one of its most}} distinguishing characteristics, was the countless small ceramic tiles, each measuring no more than a square inch in width. A multitude of the crown's tiles were loosening and many others were discolored. In order to remedy this, a new crown was designed, this time using individual sections of EIFS (Exterior <b>insulation</b> <b>finishing</b> system), which offered the decided advantages of better durability, easier maintenance and improved thermal characteristics. A foundation surface was applied directly over the existing tiles, in order to seal the crown and give the new surface something to adhere to. Once the structural work was finished, the walls, ceilings, doors, floors and other areas involved in the modification had to be put back together. Throughout the entire project, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena remained open for business. The result was a brand-new crown around the exterior of the building, as well as a new terrazzo floor on the concourse level.|$|R
