5|$|By late 1940 {{there were}} severe {{shortages}} of pilots and wireless operators/gunners, with 100 pilots and 200 other personnel required. In {{the short term}} the OTU course was reduced to get the crews out to operational commands faster. It now took no longer than a month compared with the {{six to eight weeks}} considered necessary. This reduced the number of fit pilots, and the quality of pilots overall. The number of unfit pilots was recorded at 374. To cope with the shortening of training, it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> well-stocked general training programme. Coastal Command did not possess such an administration. Only 24 pupils were graduating when the minimum requirement was 64. This was compensated by the removal of gunnery and bombing training and a reduction in night and formation flying. Still, Bomber Command received most of the 36,000 aircrew between 1940 and 1942. Entry requirements for crews were relaxed and the programmes found more recruits that way. Manpower was also supplemented by the Commonwealth with Canada providing some of the 6,500 personnel sought by the Air Ministry. By the end of 1941, the operational strength of Coastal Command increased by seven squadrons.|$|E
5|$|Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are {{not allowed}} into the main festival site. However, the {{purchase}} of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned.|$|E

5|$|For cargo transport, the Byzantines usually commandeered {{ordinary}} merchantmen as transport ships (phortēgoi) or supply ships (skeuophora). These {{appear to}} have been mostly sailing vessels, rather than oared. The Byzantines and Arabs also employed horse-transports (hippagōga), which were either sailing ships or galleys, the latter certainly modified to accommodate the horses. Given that the chelandia appear originally to have been oared horse-transports, this would imply differences in construction between the chelandion and the dromōn proper, terms which otherwise are often used indiscriminately in literary sources. While the dromōn was developed exclusively as a war galley, the chelandion would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> special compartment amidships to accommodate a row of horses, increasing its beam and hold depth. In addition, Byzantine sources refer to the sandalos or sandalion (σάνδαλος, σανδάλιον), which was a boat carried along by the bigger ships. The kind described in the De Ceremoniis had a single mast, four oars and a rudder.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain competed at the 2002 Winter Paralympics held in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, from 7 to 16 March 2002. The {{team was}} able to be made up of athletes from the whole United Kingdom; athletes from Northern Ireland, who elected to hold Irish {{citizenship}} under the pre-1999 article 2 of the Irish constitution, were eligible to represent either Great Britain or Ireland at the Paralympics. However no Northern Irish athletes took part in the Winter Paralympics until 2010 in Vancouver. In order to be eligible {{to take part in the}} Games athletes <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> disability that fell into one of the six Paralympics disability categories.|$|E
5|$|In February 1952, Hergé was {{involved}} in a car crash in which Germaine's leg was shattered; she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> steel rod implanted in it, and was confined to a wheelchair for several months. Their relationship was further strained when they received news of Wallez's death in September 1952. His friendship with Van Melkebeke also broke apart in this period, in part due to advice gained from an alleged clairvoyant, Bertje Janueneau, whom both Hergé and Germaine were increasingly relying upon for guidance. In January 1955 a young woman named Fanny Vlamynck was hired as a colourist at the Studios. Hergé embarked on an extra-marital affair with her in November 1956, {{with the rest of the}} studio staff soon finding out. Germaine grew suspicious of her husband's affections for Fanny, but was also experiencing strong romantic attraction to her ballroom dance partner. Hergé and Germaine went on a cruise for the former's fiftieth birthday in May 1957, in which they visited Casablanca, Rabat, Palermo, and Rome, and in October went on a second holiday, this time to Ostend. Following this, he revealed his affair with Fanny to Germaine.|$|E

5|$|The Committee set itself several {{rules and}} over the years {{developed}} many practices. The names had to be euphonious (they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pleasant sound). Also, their meaning had to be readily apparent to anyone interested, whether railwayman or member of the public. There had to be good publicity value in the names as well as providing good morale for the staff, and the collection of names for a class had to provide some form of class identity. Another rule was not to use names of people who were still alive at the time, and some on the Committee had a strong dislike of names or associations with the military (largely because they were fed-up with the recently ended war). There was a preference for names of heroes and other well-known people. However, slavishly following a single theme to an absurd extent was discouraged.|$|E
5|$|The age for officer {{candidates}} {{was between}} 20 and 50; they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> college degree, {{or two years}} of college and two years of professional or business experience. The enlisted age requirements were between 20 and 36; candidates had to have completed at least two years of high school. For the most part, SPARS were white, but five African-Americans did eventually serve. The agreement between the U.S. Navy and the USCG required that officer candidates receive their indoctrination training at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts. But in June 1943, the USCG withdrew from the agreement, and the indoctrination of SPAR officer candidates was transferred to the USCG Academy at New London, Connecticut. Most SPAR officers were general duty officers, but some officers received specialized training.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} co-produced by Robert L. Lippert, an American movie {{producer}} and distributor. Hammer had entered into an arrangement with Lippert in 1951 under which Lippert provided finance and supplied American stars for Hammer's films and distributed {{them in the}} United States. In return, Hammer's distribution arm, Exclusive Films, distributed Lippert's films in the United Kingdom. Lippert's company was, in fact, a front for 20th Century Fox, whose president, Spyros Skouras, {{was a close friend}} of Lippert's. Quota laws in the UK meant that US films <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> British supporting feature, so it was in the American studios' interests to fund these features to recover a greater proportion of the box office receipts.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the shift}} key, {{typewriters}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> separate key and typebar for upper-case letters; in essence, the typewriter had two keyboards, one above the other. With the shift key, manufacturing costs (and therefore purchase price) were greatly reduced, and typist operation was simplified; both factors contributed greatly to mass {{adoption of the}} technology. Certain models, such as the Barlet, had a double shift so that each key performed three functions. These little three-row machines were portable and {{could be used by}} journalists.|$|E
25|$|Westville {{was formed}} as a borough {{by an act of}} the New Jersey Legislature on April 7, 1914, from {{portions}} of Deptford Township and West Deptford Township, {{based on the results of}} a referendum held on April 28, 1914. The borough was reincorporated on March 8, 1924. Legislation had been passed in 1900 to create Westville, but it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> majority vote in favor of the new municipality in both Deptford and West Deptford. The borough was named for Thomas West, who built a home in the area in 1775 that still stands.|$|E
