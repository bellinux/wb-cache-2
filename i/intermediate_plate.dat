A series of nonlinear {{finite element method}} is employed for ultimate strength analysis of stiffened plates with pitting corrosion. Influential parameters, including plate thickness, type and size of stiffeners, pit depth and degree of pitting are varied and more than 208 finite element models are analyzed. It is found that ultimate strength is reduced by increasing pit depth to thickness ratio. Thin and <b>intermediate</b> <b>plates</b> have minimum and maximum reduction of ultimate strength with stronger stiffeners, respectively. In weak stiffener, reduction of ultimate strength in thin and <b>intermediate</b> <b>plates</b> depends on DOP. Reduction of ultimate strength in thick plates depends on thickness ofplate and DOP.

The process is then repeated, using <b>intermediate</b> <b>plating</b> seed layers if necessary, to realize the three-dimensional coil structure. The steps for sacrificial material removal involve laser patterning and chemical removal of resist and plating seed layers.

40|$|In this paper, a novel GE Compliant Plate Seal is {{proposed}} {{that consists of}} compliant plates attached to a stator in a circumferential fashion around a rotor. The compliant plates have a slot that extends radially inwards from the seal outer diameter, and an <b>intermediate</b> <b>plate</b> extends inwards into this slot from stator. This design is capable of providing passive hydrostatic feedback forces acting on the compliant plates that balance at a small tip-clearance. When the tip-clearance reduces below the equilibrium clearance, the hydrostatic lift forces cause the compliant plates to lift away from the rotor. Conversely when the tip-clearance increases above the equilibrium clearance, the hydrostatic blowdown forces cause the compliant plates to blow down towards the rotor. Due to this self-correcting behavior, this seal is capable of providing high differential pressure capability and low leakage within a limited axial span, and non-contact operation even {{in the presence of}} large rotor transients.

40|$|Using Monte Carlo simulations, we {{investigate}} the phase behavior of hard rhombic platelets {{as a function}} of the thickness of the platelets, T. The phase diagram displays a columnar phase and a crystal phase in which the platelets are stacked in columns that are arranged in a two-dimensional lattice. We find that the shape of the platelets determines the symmetry of the two-dimensional lattice, i. e., rhombic platelets form an oblique columnar phase and a simple monoclinic crystal phase. For sufficiently thick platelets, i. e., for a thickness-to-length ratio T/L> 0. 17 T/L> 0. 17, we find only an isotropic fluid, an oblique columnar phase, and a monoclinic crystal phase. Surprisingly, for an <b>intermediate</b> <b>plate</b> thickness, 0. 083 <T/L< 0. 170. 083 <T/L< 0. 17, we also find a region in between the isotropic (or nematic) phase and the columnar phase, where the smectic phase is stable.

Polymer matrix composites (PMCs) reinforced with high strength fibers provide a lightweight and high strength alternative to metals and metal alloys conventionally used in aerospace architectures. Novel reinforcements such as nanofillers offer potential to improve the mechanical properties and add multi-functionality such as radiation resistance and sensing capabilities to the PMCs. This paper reports the hypervelocity impact (HVI) test results on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fiber composites reinforced with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT). Woven UHMWPE fabrics, in addition to providing excellent impact properties and high strength, also offer radiation resistance due to inherent high hydrogen content. SWCNT have exceptional mechanical and electrical properties. BNNT (figure 1) have high neutron cross section and good mechanical properties that add multi-functionality to this system.

40|$|Ultrasonic waves which {{propagate}} {{along the}} surface of a plate can be described by the Rayleigh-Lamb frequency equation. Considerable simplification of the theoretical analysis occurs when the plate thickness is either much greater or much smaller than the ultrasonic wavelengths. In the short wavelength case, ultrasound propagates as a non-dispersive, surface-travelling (Rayleigh) wave. When all the wavelength components are much greater than the plate thickness, the zero-order Lamb wave modes are the most prominent features. In this paper; we present the results of a series of experiments on aluminium plate samples, examining the transition between the two extremum forms as the plate thickness was decreased. The broad bandwidth (10 ns rise-time) surface-travelling waves were generated using a Nd:YAG laser. They were detected, 20 mm from the source, by broadband electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs), sensitive either to the normal, or the tangential, velocity of the sample surface. On thin foils, the prominent antisymmetric zero-order Lamb mode is highly dispersive, the high-frequency components of the signal arriving first. Effects observed {{at the front of the}} signal seem to derive from the finite (1 mm) width of the detector coil. Hence, for comparison, a homodyne laser interferometer approximating to a point detector was also used. For aluminium plate with thickness greater than 6 mm, the non-dispersive Rayleigh wave was clearly distinguishable from the reverberating bulk waves.

The length of the splitter plate is varied systematically from L= 0. 5 D to L= 6 D so {{the sensitivity of the}} flow structure to the inclusion of the splitter plate can be inspected. It is found that the splitter plate introduces a strong hydrodynamic interaction to the near wake of the cylinder and the length of the plate affects significantly the flow structure. The behavior of the flow can be grouped into three regimes. For short plate lengths (0 ≲L≲D), the free shear layers are convected further downstream before rolling up when the plate length is increased. For <b>intermediate</b> <b>plate</b> lengths (1. 25 D≲L≲ 4. 75 D), a secondary vortex is clearly visible around the trailing edge of the splitter plate and the shear layers begin to roll up closer to the trailing edge. For long plate lengths (L≳ 5 D), a regime is observed in which the free shear layers reattach to the splitter plate.

40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} ductile plate {{perforation}} by sharp-nosed rigid projectiles is further {{examined in this}} work through 2 D numerical simulations. We highlight various features concerning the effective resisting stress (σr) which a finite thickness plate, with a flow stress of Yt, exerts on the projectile during perforation. In particular, we show that the normalized resisting stress (σr/Yt) can be represented as a unique function of the normalized thickness of the plate (H/D, where H is plate thickness and D is projectile diameter), for a large range of normalized thicknesses. Our simulations for very thin target plates show that the penetration process is achieved through the well-known dishing mechanism, where the target material is pushed forward by the projectile’s nose. An important observation, which emerges from our simulations, is that the transition between the dishing and the hole enlargement mechanisms takes place at a normalized thickness of about H/D= 1 / 3. We also find that the normalized resistive stress for <b>intermediate</b> <b>plate</b> thicknesses, 1 / 3 1) the σr/Yt ratio increases monotonically to values which represent the resistance to penetration of semi-infinite targets, where the stress state is characterized by plane strain conditions. Using a simple model, {{which is based on}} energy conservation, we can predict the values of the ballistic limit velocities for many projectile/target combinations, provided the perforation is done through the ductile hole enlargement mechanism. Good agreement is demonstrated between predictions from our model and experimental data from different sources, strongly enhancing the confidence in both the validity and usefulness of our model...|$|E

Freeze-fracture material revealed sets of particles interrupting the unit membrane. The more distal of these form plaquelike arrays while the proximal set of particles forms the ciliary "necklace.

40|$|Escherichia coli WP 2 {{bacteria}} with an ochre {{amino acid}} auxotrophy show {{no evidence of}} growth {{during the first few}} days after plating at densities above 108 on plates lacking the required amino acid. They lose viability for some days, and then a subpopulation recovers and there is cell turnover. At very low plating densities (around 102 per plate), almost every cell will eventually form a small but visible colony. At <b>intermediate</b> <b>plating</b> densities (106 to 107 per plate), there is an immediate {{increase in the number of}} viable bacteria. The results are consistent with a model that assumes that growth is dependent on trace amounts of tryptophan or a tryptophan-complementing substance and that death is due to extracellular toxic species in the medium, including active oxygen species. Mutations in mutT bacteria under these conditions result from incorporation of 7, 8 -dihydro- 8 -oxo-dGTP into DNA and thus largely reflect DNA synthesis associated with the increase in the number of viable cells at the initial density used (107 per plate). We show that the increase in cell number and much of this DNA synthesis can be eliminated by the presence of 108 scavenger bacteria and by removal of early-arising mutant colonies that release the required amino acid. The synthesis that remains is equivalent to less than a quarter of a genome per day and is marginally reduced, if at all, in a polA derivative. We cannot exclude the possibility that this residual DNA synthesis is peculiar to mutT bacteria due to transcriptional leakiness, although there is no evidence that this is a major problem in this strain. If such DNA synthesis also occurs in wild-type bacteria, it may well be important for adaptive mutation since use of a more refined agar in selective plates both eliminated the initial increase in cell number seen at low density (107 per plate) and reduced the rate of appearance of mutants at plating densities above 108 per plate...|$|R
