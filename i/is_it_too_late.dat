500|$|Cobb went on {{to write}} the first single-author book in {{environmental}} ethics, <b>Is</b> <b>It</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Late?</b> A Theology of Ecology, in 1971. [...] In the book, he argued for an ecological worldview that acknowledges the continuity between human beings and other living things, {{as well as their}} mutual dependence. [...] He also proposed that Christianity specifically needed to appropriate knowledge from the biological sciences in order to undercut its anthropocentrism (human-centeredness) and devaluation of the non-human world.|$|E
500|$|This {{work has}} been pioneered by John B. Cobb, Jr., whose book <b>Is</b> <b>It</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Late?</b> A Theology of Ecology (1971) was the first single-authored book in {{environmental}} ethics. [...] Cobb also co-authored a book with leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly entitled For the Common Good: Redirecting the Economy toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future (1989), which applied Whitehead's thought to economics, and received the Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order. Cobb followed this with a second book, Sustaining the Common Good: A Christian Perspective on the Global Economy (1994), which aimed to challenge [...] "economists' zealous faith in the great god of growth." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You'll see if I can't!" [...] And he {{sat down}} and tried. Oh, he tried long--he tried hard. But the G.F. <b>was</b> right. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> He couldn't.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Thou wilt return? Thou wilt surely return?' The old man {{caught at}} his wrist. 'And thou wilt return {{in this very}} same shape? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to look tonight for the River?' ...|$|E
50|$|When {{he found}} out that he <b>was</b> deceived <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late,</b> Theophylactus had been already proclaimed Patriarch and Tryphon was forced to retire to monastery where he died in 933.|$|R
6000|$|... 'How long is it,' asked Alice, 'since I went to you {{and told}} you what I had done, and when you <b>were</b> advised <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for anyone to follow?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{had been}} in your place, I'm afraid I should be glad not to have thought of it in time; and I'm afraid I'm glad that, as <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>it's</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> But doesn't <b>it</b> involve you {{with him in the}} eyes of the other young man?" [...] "Yes, I presume it does," [...] said Lemuel. [...] "I shall have to go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --"and I {{have had}} an aviary built on purpose,--just such as parrots are used to in their own country. Well, Miss Dunstable, I do call that unkind. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to send for him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I mean, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late?</b> I mean, can {{you really}} forgive me? Oh, Bill'--she stopped herself by the {{fraction}} of a second from adding 'you idiot'--'can't we be the same again to each other? Can't we--pretend all this has never happened?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came for}} you, Jane," [...] he said, [...] "on any terms--anyhow. I came {{to beg for}} your sympathy, for some measure of your affection, to beg {{you to come back}} to Charles Street. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for me to abase myself?" ...|$|E
50|$|Regarding the Bill of Rights, Dickson {{said that}} <b>it</b> has {{normally}} <b>been</b> interpreted {{to have little}} effect, so that statutes with valid objectives <b>are</b> upheld. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to re-consider that strategy.|$|R
6000|$|... "You talk--you {{look like}} Uncle Jim {{when he spoke}} of the Mormons," [...] she said. [...] "Then I used to be afraid of him. He was so different. John, you must not do {{anything}} about me. Let me <b>be.</b> <b>It's</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> He--and his men--they would hang you. And I couldn't bear that. I've enough to bear without losing my friend. Say you won't watch and wait--for--for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mary, dear, don't let Mite come in. I <b>am</b> afraid <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to {{keep you}} away, but if I had felt like this yesterday, I would have gone {{straight}} to the fever hospital.' ...|$|R
6000|$|BECKET. [...] De Morville, I {{had thought}} so well of you; {{and even now}} You seem the least assassin of the four. Oh, do not damn {{yourself}} for company! <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for me to save your soul? I pray you for one moment stay and speak.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, no! {{they are}} not old truths that I mean," [...] said Romola, {{pressing}} her clasped hands painfully together, as if that action would help her to suppress what must not be told. [...] "They are fresh things that I know, but cannot tell. Dearest godfather, you know I am not foolish. I would not come to you without reason. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to warn you against any one, every one {{who seems to be}} working on your side? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to say, `Go to your villa and keep away in the country when these three more days of office are over?' Oh God! perhaps it is too late! and if any harm comes to you, it will be as if I had done it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{might have}} known,” he said. “If I {{had had the}} courage you would have saved me from everything, but <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> now? I did it because I loved you, Violet—and you will give me the chance to redeem myself. You can’t destroy my last hope by casting me off?” ...|$|E

60|$|No more <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> For, as poor Grimes {{cried and}} blubbered on, his own tears did what his mother's could not do, and Tom's could not do, and nobody's on earth {{could do for}} him; for they washed the soot off his face and off his clothes; and then they washed the mortar away from between the bricks; and the chimney crumbled down; and Grimes began {{to get out of}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} the flames will burst through before the {{furnaces}} <b>are</b> flooded. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to cut another {{hole in the}} deck, and by an hour at the latest we must take to the boats." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hear that}} you have a lady named Brand lodging in the house," [...] I went on. [...] "I dare say I am mistaken in supposing her to be a lady of the same name whom I know. But I should like to make sure whether I am right or wrong. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to disturb your lodger to-night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> then, Evelyn Hope? [...] What, {{your soul}} was pure and true, The good stars met in your horoscope, [...] Made you of spirit, fire and dew-- [...] 20 And just because I was thrice as old [...] And our paths {{in the world}} diverged so wide, Each was naught to each, must I be told? [...] We were fellow mortals, naught beside? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Funny. You mean tragic! Look here, Esme, I'm {{not going}} to risk any more misunderstanding. There's nothing for it but plain talk when matters get to such a state as this. I love you--and I've loved you ever since I met you. I went away because I could not stay here and see you married to another man. I've stayed away for the same reason. Esme, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late?</b> Did you ever care {{anything}} for me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Salome {{listened in}} agony. Every word of Lionel Hezekiah's stung her {{conscience}} unbearably. So {{this was the}} result of her weak yielding to Judith; this innocent child looked upon her as a wicked woman, and, worse still, regarded old, depraved Abel Blair as a model to be imitated. Oh! <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to undo the evil? When Judith returned, Salome blurted out the whole story. [...] "Lionel Hezekiah must go to Sunday school," [...] she concluded appealingly.|$|R
5000|$|Thus Nivelle's plan went {{unchanged}} {{despite the}} doubts {{expressed by the}} other generals and he was under greater pressure to achieve decisive results. Prime Minister Ribot said, [...] "Our hand has <b>been</b> forced: <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to go back".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} been to inquire of Mrs. Troy if she could tell me the reason of the delay. I <b>am</b> afraid <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> now for the funeral to be {{performed}} with proper decency. Have you the registrar's certificate?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late?</b> One fierce blow at {{the unsuspecting}} {{horseman}} at his side, one cry to his French troops, one desperate charge upon the unready lines before him, and these rebellious Barons might rue {{the day they}} dared to thwart his plans! A bolder hand might have turned the game even at that point. Had it been a Richard there! the cup of liberty might have been dashed from England’s lips, and the taste of freedom held back for a hundred years.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{much that}} I had thought lost for ever," [...] he said, [...] "has {{come back to}} me. So much that I had never thought to realise in this world {{seems to be coming}} true. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for me to ask for the one {{greatest}} thing of all of the only person who could count--who ever has counted? You know so well, Katharine, that even as a soured and disappointed man I loved you, and now it is just you, and you only, who could give me--what I want in life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are still}} on the {{threshold}} of your life, Mr Wilder," [...] he said, [...] "and it is all before you to choose the path on which you will go. As yet, you have been present at no violation of what the world calls its laws; nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to say you never will be. I may have been selfish in my wish to gain you; but try me; and you will find that self, though often active, cannot, nor does not, long hold its dominion over my mind. Say but the word, and you are free; it is easy to destroy the little evidence which exists of your having made one of my crew. The land is not far beyond that streak of fading light; before to-morrow's sun shall set, your foot may tread it." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{believed}} <b>too</b> <b>late</b> that he {{had made}} a mistake, {{that he had}} thrown away the supreme chance of his life. But <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>late?</b> When he could bear it no longer, he began to deny that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> He denied <b>it</b> even to the pathetic presence which haunted him, and in which the magic of her voice itself was merged at last, so that he saw her more than he heard her. He overbore her weak will with his stronger will, and set himself strenuously to protest to her real presence what he now always said to her phantom. When his partner came back from his vacation, Langbourne told him {{that he was going to}} take a day or two off.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> afraid <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>late,</b> my dear, though I {{should like}} to live for your sake. But I think I see {{happiness}} before you, {{if you choose to}} take it; he is a noble fellow, Isobel, in spite of that unfortunate weakness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those verses, {{they came}} all limp and wet {{out of his}} pocket, and Francie made him let her dry them and copy them out; and she is so delighted with them. <b>It</b> really <b>is</b> well <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to call the baby Cyriac." ...|$|R
