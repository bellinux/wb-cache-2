30|$|Temporary opening or ‘inability to pay’ clauses {{have become}} rather popular during the Recession. They {{are to be}} {{distinguished}} from the general derogation clauses discussed in the previous paragraph. General derogation clauses delegate particular issues to be decided at enterprise level under conditions specified <b>in</b> the sector <b>agreement</b> and with outcomes that can deviate from sectoral minima or standards. In the limit case, as <b>in</b> some sector <b>agreements</b> <b>in</b> manufacturing in Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands the sector agreement does not specify (minimum) pay provisions. Temporary ‘inability to pay’ clauses allow the suspension or renegotiation of (part of) the <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> cases of hardship, although how tightly this is defined varies. General opening or derogation clauses are an instrument of organized decentralisation within sectoral agreements; they have no place <b>in</b> enterprise <b>agreements.</b> Temporary hardship clauses can apply to any collective agreement at any level and rather being an element of decentralisation they are a safety valve <b>in</b> <b>agreements</b> that define hard minimum or standard conditions, and <b>in</b> <b>agreements</b> that cover a period longer than one year.|$|R

First, for some values of these costs it is efficient to reach an agreement but the unique equilibrium outcome is one <b>in</b> which <b>agreement</b> is never reached. Secondly, even when there are equilibria <b>in</b> which an <b>agreement</b> is reached, we find that the model always has an equilibrium <b>in</b> which <b>agreement</b> is never reached, as well as equilibria <b>in</b> which <b>agreement</b> is delayed for an arbitrary length of time. Finally, the only way in which the parties can reach an <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> equilib-rium is by using inefficient punishments for (some of) the opponent’s deviations. We argue that this implies that, when the parties are given the opportunity to renegotiate out of these inefficiencies, the only equilibrium outcome which survives is the one <b>in</b> which <b>agreement</b> is never reached, regardless {{of the value of the}} transaction costs...|$|R
