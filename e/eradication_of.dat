40|$|<b>Eradications</b> <b>of</b> {{invasive}} species often have striking {{positive effects on}} native biota. However, recent {{research has shown that}} species removal in isolation can also result in unexpected changes to other ecosystem components. These secondary effects will become more likely as numbers of interacting invaders increase in ecosystems, and as exotics in late stages of invasion eliminate native species and replace their functional roles. Food web and functional role frameworks can be used to identify ecological conditions that forecast the potential for unwanted secondary impacts. Integration <b>of</b> <b>eradication</b> into a holistic process of assessment and restoration will help safeguard against accidental, adverse effects on native ecosystems...|$|R

5|$|Between 1950 and 1952, {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in Tanganyika, at Kikore and Stunyansa, to test arboricides and defoliants under tropical conditions.

However, when opium is used as a means of obtaining credit, the effects <b>of</b> <b>eradication</b> are no longer clear-cut.

5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{relatively}} mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and large mammals. Native Americans took advantage of these resources, and may have inhabited the area seasonally. However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation {{near the end of the}} nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, including the <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> large predatory animals. Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in the early to mid-twentieth century.|$|E

By 1942, killing centers at Auschwitz, Sobibór, Treblinka, and other Nazi extermination camps replaced Einsatzgruppen as the primary method of mass killing.|$|E

40|$|Invasive exotic insects {{can cause}} {{substantial}} damage to {{trees and the}} environment, and may reduce biodiversity. They can have a large negative economic effect on the forest industry, urban amenity trees and numerous other sectors, and they may necessitate extensive management expenditures. For such high-impact invaders, eradication is desirable but also difficult and often highly controversial. It requires substantial input of resources and commitment from managers and stakeholders, including the general public. Appropriate tools for surveillance {{and control of the}} target species must be available if success is to be achieved. This review outlines the sequence of steps required in well-managed operations; examines characteristics of successful and unsuccessful eradication campaigns; describes methods and tools known to be effective against specific pests; and discusses the analysis of costs and benefits <b>of</b> <b>eradication</b> programmes. Feasibility <b>of</b> <b>eradication</b> is increased by early detection, which is facilitated by systematic surveillance. A strong positive relationship exists between size of the affected geographical area and the cost <b>of</b> <b>eradication.</b> Treatment costs for large populations may be prohibitive.
