5|$|He {{made the}} Tigers team in spring {{training}} 1945 before finishing high school and without having played in the minor leagues, but {{sat on the bench}} before making his major league debut in June 1945, just a few weeks after his 18th birthday. He made three relief appearances that month and two more in September after a two-month stint with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League under manager Bucky Harris, and was on the Detroit roster for the team's victory in the 1945 World Series although he did not appear in any games. He had a remarkably unassuming presence; Paul Richards, then a catcher for the Tigers, later recalled occasionally going to his neighborhood drugstore. One day, Pierce went up to him at practice and asked why Richards never talked to him at the store, with Richards replying that he didn't know what Pierce was talking about; Pierce answered that the drugstore was his family's, and Richards slowly realized that Pierce had been the clerk behind the counter each time <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, he {{received}} criticism {{for this approach}} and it resulted in him missing the fourth Test at Headingley through injury. In England's first innings of the third Test, he {{was hit in the}} ribs by a full-blooded pull shot from Dick Pollard from the bowling of Ian Johnson, and had to be carried from the pitch by four policemen. The following day, he collapsed while practising in the nets, and when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> to bat at number six, he collapsed again and had to retire hurt. After this, he was taken to hospital where he spent 10 days before rejoining the tour for the Derbyshire match that followed the fourth Test.|$|E
5|$|Luongo {{graduated}} from Antoine de St-Exupéry in Montreal, a Francophone high school, in 1996. He began playing organized hockey {{at the age}} of eight as a forward. His father taught all his sons soccer and Luongo played until he was 14, at which point he decided to concentrate on hockey. Although he initially had the desire to play in net, his parents wanted him to develop his skating first. Several years later, after Luongo was cut from a peewee team, he made the switch to goaltender. At 11 years old, his team's usual goaltender did not show up and after begging his mother, still hesitant about Luongo playing the position, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> net and posted a shutout. In August 2009, the arena in which Luongo played his minor hockey in St. Leonard was named after him as the Roberto Luongo Arena. It is the second arena in the community to be named after an NHL goalie after the Martin Brodeur Arena was renamed as such in 2000.|$|E

5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E

25|$|Jack's {{business}} practices created {{a great deal}} of antipathy in the community. Jack was a willing lender of money and of mortgages to those living on his land, but also was quick to foreclose. As a result animosity toward him ran high, and it has been claimed he had to travel with bodyguards anywhere <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> Monterey County. The author Robert Louis Stevenson, after visiting Monterey, claimed that famed San Francisco orator Denis Kearney had suggested the residents should deal with Jack by having him hanged.|$|E
25|$|The popular {{image is}} of Johnny Appleseed {{spreading}} apple seeds randomly everywhere <b>he</b> <b>went.</b> <b>In</b> fact, he planted nurseries rather than orchards, built fences around them {{to protect them}} from livestock, left the nurseries in the care of a neighbor who sold trees on shares, and returned every year or two to tend the nursery. His first nursery was planted on the bank of Brokenstraw Creek, south of Warren, Pennsylvania. Next, he seems to have moved to Venango County along the shore of French Creek, but many of these nurseries were in the Mohican area of north-central Ohio. This area included the towns of Mansfield, Lisbon, Lucas, Perrysville, and Loudonville.|$|E
25|$|James Legge {{was born}} at Huntly, Aberdeenshire. He {{enrolled}} in Aberdeen Grammar School at age 13 and then King's College, Aberdeen at age 15. After studying at the Highbury Theological College, London, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> 1839 as a missionary to China, but remained at Malacca three years, {{in charge of the}} Anglo-Chinese College there. The College was subsequently moved to Hong Kong, where Legge lived for nearly thirty years. A Chinese Christian, Wat Ngong, accompanied Legge when he moved in 1844. He returned home to Huntly, Aberdeenshire, in 1846–7, taking with him three Chinese students. Legge and the students were received by Queen Victoria before his return to Hong Kong.|$|E

Following his release, he continued with his murders. He killed three people and injured two more severely with a screwdriver in Çorlu. Late at night, he went first to the Çorluspor facility, and murdered nightman Hüseyin Yumruk with a screwdriver. Then, he skewered Özcan Karagözoğlu in an industrial zone. Finally, he killed Şakir Temüriçi, whom he met on the street. He threw the bodies in a hole. In the early morning hours, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> Tonguçlar Mosque, wounded the imam, Salih Baş, in his neck with a screwdriver, and escaped.|$|E

The show’s high ratings and overwhelming popularity sprung Bally along with his other contesting housemates into instant stardom, becoming social media & real media heavyweights. The show also enabled him discover a fresh talent he never knew he had; his Husky Baritone Voice. His voice along with his trademark eyes and good looks got female audiences salivating. After a good run of surviving 9 weeks without ever being up for nomination he was eventually evicted in week 10 just one week shy of the grand finale.|$|E
25|$|His Test {{debut at}} Lord's was disastrous, but his next two Tests won him notice. In the final Test against Australia in 1959–60 at Calcutta, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> to bat {{towards the end}} of the first day and {{finished}} on 20 not out on the second day. He started his second innings just before stumps on the third day, batted throughout the fourth scoring only 59 runs, and was out on the final day for 74. This made him the first batsman to bat on all five days of a Test match. At Kanpur against Pakistan a year later, he batted through a whole day for just 54 runs. This innings, which lasted 505 minutes for 99 runs, ironically ended when he attempted a quick single to complete his hundred.|$|E

25|$|On Changing Rooms {{he quickly}} gained {{something}} of a reputation for clutter; {{in many ways the}} decluttering trend was a reaction against his style of design. Many times people were filmed in tears of sadness after having seen what he had done to their drawing room: frequently people {{said they were going to}} repaint the room with white paint.This reaction made him use darker colours for the walls which could not be painted over as easily. So infamous was his reputation that some people visibly winced when they realised they had got him as their designer. On 13 April 2009 he presented a documentary on BBC One in the West region in which <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>In</b> Search of England's Green & Pleasant Land. The programme explored the threats to the rural way of life from urban creep and the loss of local services.|$|E
25|$|Konstantas {{was born}} in the village of Milies, Thessaly, Ottoman Empire (present-day Greece), where he {{received}} early schooling. At the age of 20 he went to Mount Athos, Chios and Constantinople (Istambul) where he attended courses in ecclesiastical schools. In 1780 he moved to Bucharest and in 1784 he started his teaching activity in the local Princely Academy. In 1788 <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> a number of European cities (Vienna, Halle, Padua) to continue his studies, while in 1803 he negotiated with Anthimos Gazis the establishment of an advanced educational institution in his birthplace, which would contain a library of 4,000 volumes. His initiative was supported by Anthimos Gazis and was only partially realized in 1814–16 because the Ottoman authorities limited the school's functions. In the meantime he rejected an offer to teach at the Academy of Iasi and another one to become head of the Patriarchical Academy in Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|In {{the history}} of Myth, one {{particularly}} celebrated legend is that of Connacht, who, one thousand years ago, saved the world from a race of flesh-eating monsters called the Myrkridia, which had hunted humanity to near extinction over the previous millennium. Coming from the eastern land of Gower {{at the same time}} a comet appeared in the western skies, Connacht was the first human to fight the Myrkridia and survive. However, not only did he survive, he defeated them, ultimately imprisoning them in a magical prison known as the Tain, built for him by the Dwarven smiths of Muirthemne. With the Myrkridia gone, Connacht became Emperor of the Cath Bruig, presiding over a prosperous era known as the Age of Light. However, many years later, he disappeared from the historical records. It is unknown exactly what happened to him, although one theory suggests <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> search of powerful magical artifacts, fearful of the ramifications if such items should fall into the wrong hands. Whatever the truth about his disappearance, Connacht was never seen again.|$|E
