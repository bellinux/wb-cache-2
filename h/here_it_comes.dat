5|$|At {{the border}} with Deptford Township, Route 47 reaches an {{intersection}} known as Five Points. Here, the road meets Route 41, County Route 603, and County Route 630. Route 47 turns northwest as this intersection and runs through wooded areas with some dwellings, with Route 55 intersecting the route at a cloverleaf interchange a short distance later. Past this interchange, the road continues through wooded inhabited areas, eventually turning due north. It comes to an intersection with the western terminus of County Route 534 as the route heads through more suburban homes along with businesses. Past this intersection, Route 47 passes businesses before crossing over the New Jersey Turnpike without an interchange. From here, it heads through more inhabited areas before entering Westville. Upon entering Westville, the route has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 295. Past this interchange, the road runs through neighborhoods, intersecting County Route 621 (Almonesson Road) and County Route 551. The latter forms a concurrency with Route 47 and these two routes run northeast through commercial areas as a four-lane undivided road, crossing the Big Timber Creek into Brooklawn, Camden County. <b>Here,</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> to a traffic circle with U.S. Route 130 and County Route 753, where Route 47 ends and County Route 551 continues on to Camden, forming a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 130.|$|E
25|$|After {{another few}} blocks, US1 {{comes to the}} Mamaroneck town line. <b>Here</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> closer to Long Island Sound when it passes Harbor Island Park {{a mile from the}} {{municipal}} boundary, and then enters the village at Mamaroneck Avenue. A mile past that junction and downtown, NY127, also bound for White Plains, forks left at Keeler Avenue as US 1 itself begins to trend more to the east into Rye, passing Rye Neck High School at the town line.|$|E
500|$|Others, like Harold Bloom, have {{emphasized}} the [...] "exhausted landscape", the completion, the finality of death, although [...] "Winter descends here as a man might hope to die, with a natural sweetness". If death in itself is final, <b>here</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> with a lightness, a softness, also pointing to [...] "an acceptance of process beyond the possibility of grief." [...] The progress of growth is no longer necessary; maturation is complete, and life and death are in harmony. The rich description of the cycle of the seasons enables the reader to feel a belonging [...] "to something larger than the self", as James O'Rourke expresses it, but the cycle {{comes to an end}} each year, analogous to the ending of single life. O'Rourke suggests that something of a fear of that ending is subtly implied {{at the end of the}} poem, although, unlike the other great odes, in this poem the person of the poet is entirely submerged, so there is at most a faint hint of Keats's own possible fear.|$|E

2500|$|While {{a member}} of The Sports, Armiger {{produced}} [...] "Beatnik Twist" [...] as a single for Johnny Topper in 1979. As a session musician, by November 1980, he supplied lead guitar for Marc Hunter's solo album, Big City Talk. In 1981 he produced three tracks, [...] "Promise not to Tell", [...] "Lowdown" [...] and [...] "Want You Back", on former High Rise Bombers band mates, Paul Kelly and the Dots' debut album, Talk, released on Mushroom Records in March. The other tracks were produced by Joe Camilleri, except one track produced by Trevor Lucas. After The Sports had disbanded, in August 1982 Armiger produced an extended play, Club of Rome, and a single, [...] "Ululation (<b>Here</b> <b>It</b> <b>Comes</b> Again)" [...] (September 1983), for The Kevins which included Sally Ford, another former band mate. In the early 1980s, Armiger moved to New South Wales, he continued to produce records, and expanded his composition and performance of music for films and TV.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of the Soviet Rzhev-Vyazma {{strategic}} offensive operation (8 January - 20 April 1942), Operation Mars, the division now led by Lieutenant General Alfons Hitter was again serving in XXIII Corps under the Ninth Army in the Molodoi Tud sector of the Rzhev salient. <b>Here</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> under attack by the Soviet 39th army of the Kalinin Front.|$|R

Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it faded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it fell that night?

50|$|In March 1916 the Provisional Brigades were {{concentrated}} {{along the}} South East Coast of England. 21st Battalion, {{which had been}} guarding the Northumberland Coast, moved to Herne Bay, Kent and joined the 10th Provisional Brigade.

It is true I am a more thoroughly penniless man than he, for these villains have robbed me and Aileen of our rings, chains, and watches, on which I counted a good deal,--alas! But that does not mend matters. It makes them rather worse. No, it must not be! My child's interests must be considered even before gratitude. I must be firm." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>Here</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes,</b> out of {{the same}} house whence we saw brave Captain Gardner go forth to the wars. What! A coffin, borne on men's shoulders, and six aged gentlemen as pall-bearers, and a long train of mourners, with black gloves and black hat-bands, and {{everything}} black, save a white handkerchief in each mourner's hand, to wipe away his tears withal. Now, my kind patrons, you are angry with me. You were bidden to a bridal-dance, and find yourselves walking in a funeral procession. Even so; but look back through all the social customs of New England, in the first century of her existence, and read all her traits of character; and if you find one occasion, other than a funeral feast, where jollity was sanctioned by universal practice, I will set fire to my puppet-show without another word. These are the obsequies of old Governor Bradstreet, the patriarch and survivor of the first settlers, who, having intermarried with the Widow Gardner, is now resting from his labors, at the great age of ninety-four. The white-bearded corpse, which was his spirit's earthly garniture, now lies beneath yonder coffin-lid. Many a cask of ale and cider is on tap, and many a draught of spiced wine and aqua-vitae has been quaffed. Else why should the bearers stagger, as they tremulously uphold the coffin?--and the aged pall-bearers, too, as they strive to walk solemnly beside it?--and wherefore do the mourners tread on one another's heels?--and why, if we may ask without offence, should the nose of the Rev. Mr. Noyes, through which he has just been delivering the funeral discourse, glow like a ruddy coal of fire? Well, well, old friends! Pass on, with your burden of mortality, And lay it in the tomb with jolly hearts. People should be permitted to enjoy themselves in their own fashion; every man to his taste; but New England must have been a dismal abode for the man of pleasure, when the only boon-companion was Death! ...|$|E
50|$|In 1789, Augustinian Carlo Amoretti, Italian Encyclopedist and {{librarian}} of Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, {{discovered the}} authentic Italian manuscript of Antonio Pigafetta among the scattered holdings of the library. <b>Here</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> {{out that the}} port of March-April 1521 was not Butuan but Mazaua. Amoretti, who himself had not read any of five eyewitness reports of the incident including two French versions of Pigafetta's account, asserted in a footnote that Mazaua was probably the isle named Limasava in Bellin's map, thus interchanging the real port of Mazaua with the way station Gatighan.|$|R
60|$|But {{to return}} to my travelers.
