50|$|In-situ {{aggregate}} formation: Many micro-composites {{form their}} aggregate particles {{by a process}} of self-assembly. For example, in high impact polystyrene, two immiscible phases of polymer (including brittle polystyrene and rubbery polybutadiene) are mixed together. Special molecules (graft copolymers) include separate portions which are soluble in each phase, and so are only stable at the interface between them, {{in the manner of}} a detergent. Since the number of this type of molecule determines the interfacial area, and since spheres naturally form to minimize surface tension, synthetic chemists can control the size of polybutadiene droplets in the molten mix, which harden to form rubbery aggregates in a hard matrix. <b>Dispersion</b> <b>strengthening</b> is a similar example from the field of metallurgy. In glass-ceramics, the aggregate is often chosen to have a negative coefficient of thermal expansion, and the proportion of aggregate to matrix adjusted so that the overall expansion is very near zero. Aggregate size can be reduced so that the material is transparent to infrared light.|$|E
50|$|Oxide <b>dispersion</b> <b>strengthening</b> {{is based}} on incoherency of the oxide {{particles}} within the lattice of the material. The oxide particles decrease movement of dislocations within the material and in turn prevent creep. Since the oxide particles are incoherent, dislocations can only overcome the particles by climb. Whereas, if the particles were semi-coherent or coherent with the lattice, the dislocations can simply shear the particles. Climb is less energetically favourable (occurs at high temperatures) than simply shearing and therefore stops dislocation movement more effectively. Climb can occur either at the particle-dislocation interface (local climb) or by overcoming multiple particles at once (general climb). General climb requires less energy and therefore is the common climb mechanism. The presence of incoherent particles introduces a threshold stress (σt), since an additional stress {{will have to be}} applied for the dislocations to move past the oxides by climb. Moreover, dislocation even after overcoming particle by climb can still remain pinned at the particle-matrix interface with an attractive phenomenon called interfacial pinning which further requires additional threshold stress to detach a dislocation out of this pinning, which must be overcome for the plastic deformation to occur. The following equations represent the strain rate and stress {{as a result of the}} introduction of oxides in the material.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Vanadium microalloyed steels {{with high}} yield {{strength}} (≈ 600 MPa), good toughness and ductility {{have been successfully}} produced in commercial thin slab casting plants employing direct rolling after casting. Because of the high solubility of VN and VC, most of the vanadium {{is likely to remain}} in solution during casting, equalisation and rolling. While some vanadium is precipitated in austenite as cuboids and pins the grain boundaries, a major fraction is available for <b>dispersion</b> <b>strengthening</b> of ferrite. Despite a coarse as-cast grain size, significant grain refinement can be achieved by repeated recrystallisation during hot rolling. Consequently, a fine and uniform ferrite grain structure is produced in the final strip. Increasing the V and N levels increases <b>dispersion</b> <b>strengthening</b> which occurs together with a finer ferrite grain size. The addition of titanium to a vanadium containing steel, decreases the yield strength due to the formation of V-Ti(N) particles in austenite during both casting and equalisation. These large particles reduced the amount of V and N available for subsequent precipitation of fine (~ 5 nm) V rich <b>dispersion</b> <b>strengthening</b> particles in ferrite...|$|E

The results were compared to those from a non-oxide <b>dispersion</b> <b>strengthened</b> Fe 14 Cr alloy {{produced by}} following the same powder metallurgy route.

The first one starting at T> 750 ºC is attributed to thermal shrinkage of large vacancy clusters, or voids.
