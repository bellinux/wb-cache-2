500|$|It did {{not take}} long for Smith to earn {{recognition}} in the major leagues, making what some consider his greatest fielding play only ten games into his rookie season. The Padres played host to the Atlanta Braves on April 20, 1978, and with two out {{in the top of}} the fourth inning, Atlanta's Jeff Burroughs hit a ground ball up the middle. Smith described the play by saying, [...] "He hit a ball back up the middle that <b>everybody</b> <b>thought</b> was going into center field. I instinctively broke to my left and dove behind second. As I was in the air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind me, but I was able to catch it with my bare hand. I hit the ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first." ...|$|E

I was up all night rocking that joint. [...] same lyrics, I just reproduced the track." [...] "The Darkchild Remix" [...] was initially being sent to radio stations in the United States in mid-March 2002 and then became the opening track of the compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 10 later that year; however, it was only released on April 1, 2002. The remix was heavily played in dance clubs, and Jerkins said he wasn't surprised with the popularity of it, since [...] " [...] reinvented herself. <b>Everybody</b> <b>thought</b> she was gonna come back with another 'Oops!... I Did It Again', but she went left and came with the 'I'm a Slave 4 U' joint, which is basically a club banger. You gotta big up people who reinvent themselves. I always said she was gonna {{be one of the}} people that's gonna be around for a minute, because I see that in her." [...] Finnish musician and record producer Jaakko Salovaara also created two remixes for the track, titled [...] "JS16 Dub" [...] and [...] "JS16 Remix". The latter was included on the promotional soundtrack of Spears' debut movie, Crossroads (2002).|$|E

In July 2010, she placed Miles second on her list of best soap characters. She spoke about how [...] "ridiculous storylines" [...] {{turn out to}} be great onscreen and referred to Miles's visions of Rabbit, which she went on to praise. She said [...] "Miles's grief, his visions of Rabbit and his torment at everyone telling him she wasn't real were devastating to watch, and this was a really interesting avenue to take one of the soap's best-loved characters down that could have spectacularly backfired, but instead, had people bawling their eyes out." [...] Holy Soap have said that Miles's most memorable moment is [...] "When he found student Trey trying to kiss Kirsty, Miles pushed him and found his job as a teacher in jeopardy". The website also named Miles as one their Summer Bay hunks. In 2010, the Daily Record said that [...] "poor old Miles" [...] had a so many problems that [...] "he was probably happier when <b>everybody</b> <b>thought</b> he was just sister Sally's friend". After Miles became involved with Shandi, they stated that true love [...] "never ran smoothly in Summer Bay" [...] and that with Shandi; Miles got [...] "a lot more than he first bargained for". Australian television website Throng, said Miles looked completely different after Quong Tart lost weight. They said he looks [...] "a lot older, thinner, has a new hair style and is sporting a dark beard!" ...|$|E

They express the thoughts which will be everybody's two or three centuries after them. Such an one was Descartes.|$|R

2500|$|While the anime {{faithfully}} adapts most of {{the characters}} from the manga series, it does make some changes. In the manga, Momiji is half-German and half-Japanese and regularly speaks German, particularly when he first meets Tohru. In the anime, no German is spoken. Shigure's darker side is toned down in the anime; many remarks he makes in the manga that hint at a hidden agenda are left out, along with most of his early scenes with Akito. In the anime, Akito is biologically male and will die {{at a young age}} because of the curse, while in the manga, Akito is biologically female but brought up as male and is not dying. This served as a shocking plot twist in the manga, since almost <b>everybody</b> <b>thought</b> that Akito was male. Additionally, Isuzu [...] "Rin" [...] Sohma, the Horse, and Kureno Sohma, the Rooster, are never mentioned or shown in the anime. Finally, the curse is not lifted in the anime because it only covers the first third of the manga, at the most, and the happy ending does not occur until the series is finished.|$|E

The name of D.A.S. according to Healy is [...] "Dead Artist Syndrome means greater in death than in life, be it James Dean, Van Gogh or Jesus Christ". His debut album Prints of Darkness was a notable, groundbreaking release. After several years of inactivity in the late 1990s due to health issues, Healy is active again, having released two albums {{so far in the}} 2000s.

Despite the uncertainty regarding the band's future, Slayer still worked on a followup to World Painted Blood. Additionally, it was reported that the new album would still feature material written by Hanneman.|$|R

The Chorus were excessively nervous, perhaps as labouring under the dreadful apprehension that some good thing was going to be diverted from them! Bishop alone talked steadily and evenly. He conversed with the great Physician on that relaxation of the throat with which young curates were too frequently afflicted, and on the means of lessening the great prevalence of that disorder in the church. Physician, as a general rule, was of opinion {{that the best way to}} avoid it was to know how to read, before you made a profession of reading. Bishop said dubiously, did he really think so? And Physician said, decidedly, yes he did.|$|R
