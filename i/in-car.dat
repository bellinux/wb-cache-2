5|$|Monster re-entered {{the auto}} audio {{market in the}} early 1990s with {{a new line of}} speaker cables and its first speaker product, the Persona One. Its {{high-end}} M-series product line was introduced in 1992. It also expanded internationally, especially in Asia. Monster had a Taiwanese distributor file its trademark in the region, which led to the distributor continuing to sell products under the Monster brand after their agreement with Monster was terminated. This led to a lengthy legal battle and eventually a settlement. Monster acquired the Entec <b>in-car</b> audio brand in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry-level}} 200 {{series was}} expanded with six new processors using 28 nanometer manufacturing and dual or quad-core options in June 2013. The Snapdragon 805 was released that November. The 410, which {{is intended for}} low-cost phones in developing nations, was announced the following month. In January 2014, Qualcomm introduced {{a modified version of}} the Snapdragon 600 called 602A that is intended for <b>in-car</b> infotainment screens, backup cameras, and other driver assistance products. The quad-core Snapdragon 610 and eight-core 615 were announced in February 2014. The Snapdragon 808 and 810 were announced in April 2014. The newest iteration in Snapdragon 800 series is Snapdragon 835, which is the first Qualcomm SOC that is built on a 10nm architecture. As of October 2016, the Snapdragon 835 contained the fastest processor in the Snapdragon line.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to combine}} his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the direct {{predecessor}} of the Stereo 8 cartridge, {{also known as}} the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only <b>in-car</b> units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system remains}} unchanged from Ridge Racer, the checkpoint and time limit system remain the same; {{running out of}} time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting is more like Ridge Racer 2. The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission. Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a rear-view mirror when using the <b>in-car</b> view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available {{at the start of the}} game. Ridge Racer Revolution features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racers courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.|$|E

25|$|In June 2016, the MTA began {{installing}} Wi-Fi in four R160s {{assigned to}} the Jamaica Yard. <b>In-car</b> Wi-Fi was expanded to 20 R160s by September. This pilot program was not advertised to passengers.|$|E
25|$|The {{subscription}} service replaces {{the need to}} periodically update <b>in-car</b> navigation systems that use CD, or DVD installed maps that must be updated with the latest information. The maps are sent by internet connections established through the vehicles TCU (telematics control unit), unlike other Nissan vehicles that use the driver's cell phone to connect to their data services.|$|E
25|$|Also {{during the}} decade of 2010, the {{development}} of the software industry resulted in the formation of 92 companies and 440 microbusiness. One of these companies, Making Sense, opened offices at San Antonio, Austin and Boston, in the United States. Along with the American COPsync, Inc, the company developed in 2013 the software for VidTac, an <b>in-car</b> video system for law enforcement, and the internet landing page application Lander, bought by the Silicon Valley company QuestionPro in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The 1989 Troféo, {{which was}} no longer badged {{externally}} as a Toronado, could be ordered with the Visual Information Center: a dash mounted touch-screen CRT that controlled the vehicle's thermostat and radio and also supplied advanced instrumentation such as a trip computer. The following is a link to pictures of various CRT screens. The VIC could also serve as the interface to an <b>in-car</b> hands-free cell phone. Troféo also received standard anti-lock brakes and a new steering wheel that featured buttons for radio and climate controls. Toronados now had standard bucket seats with console, although the split-bench seat was still offered as an option.|$|E
25|$|The InterCity 125 {{is still}} in {{widespread}} use. First Great Western planned to supplement (but not replace) its InterCity 125s with 14 Class 180 Adelante trains, which can travel at the same speed. Because every carriage has an underfloor engine, they can accelerate approximately twice as quickly, which reduces journey times and allows for more frequent services. However, <b>in-car</b> noise levels are {{higher than in the}} InterCity 125 because of the underfloor engines, which, combined with less-comfortable seats and harsh interior lighting, has made them unpopular with passengers. They also proved to be unreliable, leading to a significant overhaul programme in 2004 to fix the major problems. These issues ultimately led to the units being withdrawn from First Great Western services and transferred to open access operators Grand Central and Hull Trains.|$|E
25|$|The Proton Prevé {{was finally}} {{unveiled}} on 16 April 2012 at Seri Kembangan by the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak. It launched {{with a choice}} of six colours and three trim variants, the Executive MT, Executive CVT and Premium CVT respectively. Both Executive trim variants are powered by Proton's 1.6L CamPro IAFM+ engine. The Executive MT is paired with a five-speed manual gearbox whereas the Executive CVT is equipped with a six-speed CVT. The Premium trim is offered with the superior 1.6L turbocharged CamPro CFE engine, mated to a seven-speed CVT, also known as ProTronic, Proton's version of a manumatic transmission. Safety-wise, the Executive variants are equipped with dual SRS airbags and an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) whereas the Premium trim features an additional two airbags, Brake Assist (BA), Traction Control (TCS) and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) on top of those offered in the Executive. The Premium variant is also equipped with exclusive kit such as steering-mounted paddle shifters, automatic headlights and wipers, cruise control, climate control, a built-in touchscreen GPS head unit with Bluetooth, USB & iPod connectivity as well as push-start engine ignition. All Proton Prevés are equipped with a Smart Information Display system (SiD) that displays information such as average fuel consumption, battery health and distance to empty. Another standard feature is <b>in-car</b> WiFi, made possible by a collaboration between Proton and Malaysian ISP, Yes 4G. The Prevé is priced between RM59,540 and RM72,990 respectively. It received over 11,000 bookings within two months of its official launch and became the 7th best-selling car in Malaysia for the month of May 2012, topping all rivals in its category.|$|E
500|$|Webber's Jaguar career started disappointingly when he {{qualified}} in 14th {{place for}} the [...] before being forced to retire on lap 15 with a rear suspension failure. The following race in Malaysia was problematic for Webber; Giancarlo Fisichella began reversing towards him on the starting grid and then Webber's <b>in-car</b> fire extinguisher discharged into his face. He was eventually forced to retire from 8th position with an oil consumption problem.|$|E
500|$|The Volt uses a plug {{specification}} {{published in}} 2009, SAE J1772-2009, {{that is considered}} a standard for electric cars in North America. Depending on <b>in-car</b> settings a full charge will take approximately 10 hours (12A setting) {{to as much as}} 14 hours (8A setting) from a standard North American 120V, 15A outlet and about 4 hours from a 240VAC source and suitable 240V EVSE. The Volt comes with a [...] charging cord suitable for the standard household power outlet in its country of sale. If plugged in, recharging can be controlled remotely through a smartphone application.|$|E
500|$|The prime {{inspiration}} for the game was Formula One, and Grin tried to recreate the feeling of speed captured by the <b>in-car</b> cameras. In order to achieve a good on screen reference for the speeds attained, the track was redesigned into a tunnel, allowing the entire screen {{to act as a}} reference. Coupling this with scenes of the outdoors enabled Grin to create [...] "a total speed simulation". The settings were inspired by various sources, the city tracks drew inspiration from the films Blade Runner and The Fifth Element, other tracks took their inspiration from nature, such as the Amazon Rainforest and snow scenes of Siberia. Ballistics took cues from other futuristic racing games, such as WipEout and Rollcage, emulating the fun and the speed whilst taking it even further with high end graphics.|$|E
500|$|On 1 May 1994, Ayrton Senna {{was killed}} during the San Marino Grand Prix. Prost was a pallbearer at the Brazilian's funeral. Speaking {{four years after the}} Brazilian's death, Prost told Nigel Roebuck that he had [...] "always refused to speak about him". When Senna died, Prost stated that [...] "a part of himself had died also", because their careers had been so bound together. Senna had also felt the same when Prost had retired at the end of 1993, when he {{admitted}} to a close friend that he had realised how much of his motivation had come from fighting with Prost. Only {{a couple of days before}} his death, when filming an <b>in-car</b> lap of Imola for French television channel TF1, he greeted Prost, by then a pundit on the channel: [...] "A special hello to my,... to our dear friend Alain. We all miss you Alain." [...] Prost said that he was amazed and very touched by the comment.|$|E

[...] the tool seems to be discontinued.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{there were}} many inexpensive, {{imported}} cars in Sweden at the time, Scania-Vabis decided to build high-class, luxury cars, for instance the type III limousine from 1920 that had a top hat holder in the roof. Prince Carl of Sweden owned a 1913 Scania-Vabis 3S, a type which was fitted with <b>in-car</b> buttons so the passenger could communicate with the driver. Scania-Vabis also built two-seat sports cars (or [...] "sportautomobil").|$|E

He restarted in 15th and never recovered. With 3 laps left while running in 8th place Ambrose tangled with road-course rival Max Papis, ending his hopes to win three races in a row at the Glen. Ambrose was visibly upset with Papis in the aftermath, furiously tossing his steering wheel at the <b>in-car</b> camera, tossing his helmet hard through his window, and pointing his finger at Papis when Papis came by under caution. Ambrose finished 31st. Had he won, Ambrose would have joined Jeff Gordon and Mark Martin as the only drivers in NASCAR history to win three consecutive races at the Glen.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012, several U.S. owners {{reported}} seeing only 11 of 12 battery capacity {{bars on the}} <b>in-car</b> display which led them to believe they had lost some battery capacity. As time went on, more people {{reported seeing}} the issue, and some had lost two, three, and even in rare cases, four battery capacity bars. The battery capacity loss problem seems to be concentrated in regions with hot climate, and Phoenix, Arizona {{and the state of}} Texas in particular. In July 2012, Nissan responded by saying they were investigating the issue, and a carmaker spokesman also said that [...] "the problem is isolated to maybe 0.3 percent of the 13,000 Leafs on U.S. roads, and the company reportedly has loaned cars to some Leaf owners in Arizona as it researches the issue."

The 61-year-old Brock was killed instantly. His co-driver, Mick Hone, was taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition. Video footage of the crash (provided by a fan and the <b>in-car</b> camera) was reviewed by Western Australian police to help determine the cause of the accident. Coroner Alastair Hope decided that his death was caused by high speed and that no coronial inquest would be performed.
