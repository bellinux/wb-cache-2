The interface of the fibers and matrix is preferentially ablated, and then erosion extends to the fibers and matrix.

40|$|International audienceA {{solution}} {{to protect the}} surface of a carbon/carbon composite from oxidation at high temperature is to combine refractory <b>carbides,</b> such as <b>hafnium</b> and silicon <b>carbides</b> (<b>HfC</b> and SiC). Their depositions have been studied on flat substrates and present major protection against oxidation at high temperature (several minutes at 2000 °C under air). Infiltration of these carbides layers has been observed inside the open porosities of the carbon substrate which enhance the adhesion of the protection. The low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) process developed here allows multilayer HfC/SiC depositions. The HfC coatings studied have various morphologies and thicknesses depending on the experimental conditions (temperature, pressure, dilution). This carbide has been firstly deposited over flat graphite substrates and carbon single fibers. Secondly, the multilayer coating deposition over a C/C composite and over carbon single fibers is studied. Finally, HfC layers have been infiltrated inside carbon fiber tows.

Materials with high wear resistance and high melting temperatures have the potential to produce coatings that resist degradation when subjected to high temperatures and high contact stresses. Among the carbides, Al 4 SiC 4 is a low density (3. 03 g/cm 3), high melting temperature (3 ̆e 2000 ˚C) compound, characterized by superior oxidation resistance, and high compressive strength. These desirable properties motivated this investigation to (1) obtain high-density Al 4 SiC 4 at lower sintering temperatures by hot pressing, and (2) to enhance its mechanical properties by adding WC and TiC to the Al 4 SiC 4.

40|$|Tantalum carbide (TaC) and <b>hafnium</b> <b>carbide</b> (<b>HfC)</b> possess {{extremely}} high melting points, around 3900 oC, {{which are the}} highest among the known materials. TaC and HfC exhibit superior oxidation resistance under oxygen deficient and rich environments, respectively. A versatile material can be expected by forming solid solutions of TaC and HfC. However, the synthesis of fully dense solid solution carbide is a challenge due to their intrinsic covalent bonding which makes sintering challenging. The aim of the present work is to synthesize full dense TaC-HfC solid solutions by spark plasma sintering with five compositions: pure HfC, HfC- 20 vol. % TaC (T 20 H 80), HfC- 50 vol. % TaC (T 50 H 50), HfC- 80 vol. % TaC (T 80 H 20), and pure TaC.

While exposed to the plasma flow, samples were exposed to a temperature of approximately 2800 oC with a gas flow speed greater than 300 m/s. Density measurements confirm near full density was achieved for all compositions, with the highest density measured in the HfC-contained samples, all consolidated without sintering aids. Confirmation of solid solution was completed using x-ray diffraction, which had an excellent match with the theoretical values computed using Vegard’s Law, which confirmed the formation of the solid solutions.

A 251 bf thruster was fabricated from a novel CMC sandwich construction with a HfC-TaC matrix, and survived two test firings, each of 5 seconds before a failure in the injector caused the run to be aborted. It was not possible to control the relative stoichiometry of the HfC and TaC composition throughout the reactor due to the large difference in the thermodynamics of the HfC and TaC formation from their respective chlorides.

Reduction to HfC and ZrC began at a low temperature of 1250 °C and removal of the oxide phase was achieved at 1450 °C. The carbide powder was nanocrystalline size less than 100 nm. Production of HfC included a synthesis step that limited investigation of the sol-gel process. However, purchased alkoxides for zirconium allowed for detailed understanding of phase changes using X-ray Diffraction of the oxide and Raman Spectroscopy of carbon evolution. Morphology changes were observed using nitrogen gas sorption. Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy was used to image the carbide lattice, surface oxides and graphene-like carbons in the microstructure. While HfC synthesis demonstrated that shrinking core models apply, the ZrC results indicated {{that this type of}} nanoparticle carbothermal synthesis involved agglomeration and necking as a viable mode of mass transport in completing the carbothermal reduction. Understanding of this process allowed for the modest development of composites by sol-gel coating of powders. The sol-gel coating of ZrB 2 was successfully applied to coat ZrC nanoparticles on the powder. Detailed refinement of carbon content in the sol-gel coating was necessary reduce the surface oxide intrinsic to the ZrB 2 surface, while providing carbon for the sol-gel oxides. The sol-gel coating created a homogenous mix of ~ 200 nm ZrC on the ZrB 2 surface after heat-treatment at 1450 °C. Densification of the ZrB 2 - 5 %ZrC powder was achieved by spark plasma sintering (SPS) at 1800 °C, resulting in submicron sized ZrC particles at grain boundaries and triple points. The amount of carbon added to the sol-gel precursor dictated the porosity and thus some properties of the composites. Flexural strength of ~ 400 MPa was obtained from the composites but no significant improvement of fracture toughness was observed. However, an improvement in hardness of about 20 % was observed over monolithic ZrB 2. The oxidation performance of the composites was improved by the addition of a sacrificial carbide phase. Sharp leading edge samples were oxidized at 3000 °C and were compared to a traditional powder mixed composite. The finer and more homogenous distribution of ZrC caused gradual oxidation while maintaining leading edge stability. However, the powder mixed composite failed under the test.

40|$|Melting {{temperature}} calculation {{has important}} {{applications in the}} theoretical study of phase diagrams and computational materials screenings. In this thesis, we present two new methods, i. e., the improved Widom's particle insertion method and the small-cell coexistence method, which we developed in order to capture melting temperatures both accurately and quickly. We propose a scheme that drastically improves the efficiency of Widom's particle insertion method by efficiently sampling cavities while calculating the integrals providing the chemical potentials of a physical system. This idea enables us to calculate chemical potentials of liquids directly from first-principles {{without the help of}} any reference system, which is necessary in the commonly used thermodynamic integration method. As an example, we apply our scheme, combined with the density functional formalism, to the calculation of the chemical potential of liquid copper. The calculated chemical potential is further used to locate the melting temperature. The calculated results closely agree with experiments. We propose the small-cell coexistence method based on the statistical analysis of small-size coexistence MD simulations. It eliminates the risk of a metastable superheated solid in the fast-heating method, while also significantly reducing the computer cost relative to the traditional large-scale coexistence method. Using empirical potentials, we validate the method and systematically study the finite-size effect on the calculated melting points. The method converges to the exact result in the limit of a large system size. An accuracy within 100 K in melting temperature is usually achieved when the simulation contains more than 100 atoms. DFT examples of Tantalum, high-pressure Sodium, and ionic material NaCl are shown to demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of the method in its practical applications. The method serves as a promising approach for large-scale automated material screening in which the melting temperature is a design criterion. We present in detail two examples of refractory materials. First, we demonstrate how key material properties that provide guidance in the design of refractory materials can be accurately determined via ab initio thermodynamic calculations in conjunction with experimental techniques based on synchrotron X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis under laser-heated aerodynamic levitation. The properties considered include melting point, heat of fusion, heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficients, thermal stability, and sublattice disordering, as illustrated in a motivating example of lanthanum zirconate (La 2 Zr 2 O 7). The close agreement with experiment in the known but structurally complex compound La 2 Zr 2 O 7 provides good indication that the computation methods described can be used within a computational screening framework to identify novel refractory materials. Second, we report an extensive investigation into the melting temperatures of the Hf-C and Hf-Ta-C systems using ab initio calculations. With melting points above 4000 K, <b>hafnium</b> <b>carbide</b> (<b>HfC)</b> and tantalum carbide (TaC) are among the most refractory binary compounds known to date. Their mixture, with a general formula Ta x Hf 1 -x C y, is known to have a melting point of 4215 K at the composition Ta 4 HfC 5, which has long been considered as the highest melting temperature for any solid. Very few measurements of melting point in tantalum and hafnium carbides have been documented, because of the obvious experimental difficulties at extreme temperatures. The investigation lets us identify three major chemical factors that contribute to the high melting temperatures. Based on these three factors, we propose and explore a new class of materials, which, according to our ab initio calculations, may possess even higher melting temperatures than Ta-Hf-C. This example also demonstrates the feasibility of materials screening and discovery via ab initio calculations for the optimization of "higher-level" properties whose determination requires extensive sampling of atomic configuration space. ...|$|E

50|$|Tantalum {{carbides}} form {{a family}} of binary chemical compounds of tantalum and carbon with the empirical formula TaCx, where x usually varies between 0.4 and 1. They are extremely hard, brittle, refractory ceramic materials with metallic electrical conductivity. They appear as brown-gray powders, which are usually processed by sintering. Being important cermet materials, tantalum carbides are commercially used in tool bits for cutting applications and are sometimes added to tungsten carbide alloys. The melting points of tantalum carbides peak at about 3880 °C depending on the purity and measurement conditions; this value is among the highest for binary compounds. Only tantalum <b>hafnium</b> <b>carbide</b> may have a slightly higher melting point of about 3942 °C, whereas the melting point of <b>hafnium</b> <b>carbide</b> is {{comparable to that of}} TaC.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Ceramic {{films are}} {{increasingly}} used to coat a large {{variety of materials}} and chemical vapour deposition is thus an appropriate process to get high performance mechanical parts. In order to reinforce carbon foams for high temperature applications, the possibility of covering such a substrate by a few micrometers thick deposit of <b>hafnium</b> <b>carbide</b> is investigated. The reason why is that <b>hafnium</b> <b>carbide</b> is the binary carbide that exhibits the higher melting point (= 3850 °C) whereas the temperature range for the expected application {{is as high as}} 3000 °C. The conditions of HfC deposit are first studied by means of thermodynamical calculations. A few trends of the chemical system are pointed out which allow us to select appropriate gaseous precursors, experimental parameters and the associated variation range. Experimentally, the significant parameters are evidenced using experimental planning method. An attempt to correlate the experimental and calculated main results is discussed. 1...|$|R

40|$|On highly oxygen {{deficient}} {{thin films}} of hafnium oxide (hafnia, HfO 2 − x) contaminated with adsorbates of carbon oxides, {{the formation of}} <b>hafnium</b> <b>carbide</b> (HfCx) at the surface during vacuum annealing at temperatures as low as 600 [*]°C is reported. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy {{the evolution of the}} HfCx surface layer related to a transformation from insulating into metallic state is monitored in situ. In contrast, for fully stoichiometric HfO 2 thin films prepared and measured under identical conditions, the formation of HfCx was not detectable suggesting that the enhanced adsorption of carbon oxides on oxygen deficient films provides a carbon source for the carbide formation. This shows that a high concentration of oxygen vacancies in carbon contaminated hafnia lowers considerably the formation energy of <b>hafnium</b> <b>carbide.</b> Thus, the presence of a sufficient amount of residual carbon in resistive random access memory devices might lead to a similar carbide formation within the conducting filaments due to Joule heating...|$|R
