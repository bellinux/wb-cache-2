5000|$|The Exeter Book {{contains}} the Old English poems {{known as the}} 'Elegies': The Wanderer (<b>fol.</b> 76b - <b>fol.</b> 78a); The Seafarer (<b>fol.</b> 81b - <b>fol.</b> 83a); The Riming Poem <b>fol.</b> 94a - <b>fol.</b> 95b); Deor (<b>fol.</b> 100a - <b>fol.</b> 100b), Wulf and Eadwacer (<b>fol.</b> 100b - <b>fol.</b> 101a); The Wife's Lament (<b>fol.</b> 115a - <b>fol.</b> 115b); The Husband's Message (<b>fol.</b> 123a - 123b); and The Ruin (<b>fol.</b> 123b - <b>fol.</b> 124b).The term [...] "elegy" [...] can be confusing due to the diverse definitions from different cultures and times. For example, the Oxford English Dictionary states: [...] "In Greek and Latin literature elegiac metre was used for poetry expressing personal sentiments {{on a range of}} subjects, including epigrams, laments, sympotic poetry, and (in Rome) love poetry." [...] In Victorian literature, an elegy is generally a poem written for the dead and although the naming of these poems as 'elegiac' was a Victorian invention, it can be a useful term. As Anne Klinck in her book 'The Old English Elegies' writes: 'genre should be conceived, we think, as a grouping of literary works based, theoretically, upon both outer form (specific meter or structure) and also upon inner form (attitude, tone, purpose — more crudely, subject and audience)'.In regards to the Exeter Book Elegies, this term can be widened to include [...] "any serious meditative poem." [...] The poems included in the Exeter book share common themes of longing, loneliness, pain, and the passage of time.|$|R

30|$|Graphene, {{arranged}} by single-layer carbon {{atoms in the}} shape of a unique hexagonal honeycomb lattice structure, is a promising two-dimensional transparent conductive material for flexible organic light-emitting device (<b>FOLED)</b> due to its excellent conductivity, high transmittance, and flexibility [1 – 3]. Jong has fabricated 30 -in. graphene films by layer-by-layer stacking and measured its sheet resistance at values as low as ∼[*] 30 Ω/sq. and transparency at ∼[*] 90 %, which is superior to commercial indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes [4]. Chiu reported a high-mobility boron-doped graphene acting as an effective anode of <b>FOLED</b> with a record-high external quantum efficiency ~[*] 24.6 % [5].|$|E
30|$|The {{optoelectronic}} characteristics, including current density-voltage-luminance (J-V-L) {{and current}} efficiency-voltage (CE-V) of the FOLEDs with/without secondary-transferring graphene electrode structure, {{are shown in}} Fig.  5 c, d for device units D 1 (based on SLG/HRA/PET), D 2 (based on SLG/ NOA 63), and D 3 (based on PEDOT:PSS/SLG/NOA 63). As we can see, D 1 in which the graphene transferred by the first bubbling progress showed a significant drop in brightness and current density at a voltage of 13  V; as mentioned before, the sharp wrinkles existing {{on the surface of}} graphene caused the local current to short-circuit, making the <b>FOLED</b> unable to withstand a large current density. While D 2 shows a stable upward trend, even if the voltage was high to 14.5  V with a luminance of ~[*] 15000  cd/m 2, this was attributed to the decrease of sharp winkles of graphene film after the secondary transfer. What is more, we can see that the secondary transfer process almost did not reduce the performance of <b>FOLED</b> by comparing the current efficiency of D 1 and D 2; a series of repetitive experiments also support this conclusion. We further improved the brightness and efficiency of <b>FOLED</b> by introducing the modified layer PEDOT:PSS as the D 3 showed. The luminance of the D 3 can reach 35000  cd/m 2, and the maximum current efficiency was 16.19  cd/A, which was higher than the D 2 of 10.74  cd/A. That is because PEDOT:PSS played a role as work function stair and enhanced the sheet conductivities. Furthermore, it also smoothed the surface of secondary-transferring SLG film by filling part of the “Valley,” making the <b>FOLED</b> more stable.|$|E

Avouris studied the structural morphology and electronic properties in CVD graphene wrinkles by quantum transport calculations and AFM images; the maximum collapsed wrinkle height can reach about 6  nm, and the local interlayer tunneling effect across the collapsed region contributed a significant resistance to the overall device [19]. Generally, by adjusting the parameters of CVD process [20], pretreatment of copper foil [21], and surface modification [22, 23], the density of defects can be reduced to a certain extent. However, compared with these defects in the preparation process and the wrinkles caused by the transfer process, little attention has been paid to the sharp wrinkles caused by graphene duplicating the grain boundary cracks of copper foil. These grain boundary cracks, produced in Cu foil pre-annealing treatment process, are the result of polycrystalline copper recrystallizing at high temperature to form larger-size single crystal domains. Since graphene is grown on the surface of Cu foil, its topography will completely replicate the surface structure of Cu foil, including the cracks. After transferring, the cracks of graphene on Cu foil will become the sharp wrinkles on the target substrate, so sharp wrinkles are ubiquitous and inevitable on graphene film, no matter what type of transfer process used, such as mediator-assisted transfer [24], direct dry and wet transfer [25], and mass production roll-to-roll transfer [26]; these sharp wrinkles undoubtedly cause large surface roughness of graphene films, resulting in a poor performance of organic devices, especially <b>FOLED</b> [27].|$|E
40|$|The cell {{envelope}} of Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, {{consists of a}} double membrane separated by the periplasm. Due to this architecture, the cell can maintain a microenvironment essential for cell viability. Several outer membrane proteins (OMPs), such as PhoE, are implicated in providing the cell of its nutrients. PhoE functions in the outer membrane as a trimeric pore allowing passive diffusion of preferentially anionic compounds with molecular masses up to 600 Da. OMPs are synthesized in the cytoplasm as precursor proteins with an N-terminal extension, the signal sequence. These precursors are translocated across the inner membrane via the Sec machinery, and the signal sequence is cleaved off. In this thesis we addressed the question whether periplasmic intermediates exists in the biogenesis of OMPs. PhoE is used in our laboratory as a model protein to study the biogenesis of OMPs. Artificial disulfide bonds were constructed within and between PhoE monomers, based upon the known 3 D-structure. Formation of these disulfide bonds required {{the presence of the}} periplamic DsbA and DsbG proteins, respectively, which catalyze disulfide bonds in unfolded and folded structures, respectively. These findings indicated that folding of the monomer and trimer occurs at least partially in the periplsm. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the periplamic peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase SurA functions as a chaperone in the biogenesis of PhoE since folding of a PhoE mutant lacking its proline residues still required the presence of SurA. PhoE monomers are <b>foled</b> as a b-barrel with 16 -antiparallel b-strands. These strands are connected by short turns at the periplasmic side and long loop at the surface-exposed side of the membrane. The third loop (L 3) is folded into the barrel, thereby forming a constriction at half the height of the membrane. The sequence PEFGG at the tip of L 3 is highly conserved in a superfamily of bacterial porins. The L 3 is involved in voltage-dependent closing of the pore. In this thesis the channel characteristics of mutant PhoE porins in which either the tip of the constriction loop was connected to the barrel wall or residues within the conserved PEFGG sequence were replaced, were determined. The experiments demonstrated that pore closings are not mediated by a gross movement of L 3 within the channel, but by more subtle rearrangements, involving only parts of L 3 or the side chains of the charged residues wihtin the constriction zone...|$|E

40|$|Phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs) {{have gained}} {{a lot of}} {{attention}} due to their remarkable capability of achieving nearly 100 % internal quantum efficiency. Although PHOLEDs are a promising technology for the development of high performance display panels and low power consumption lighting sources, their poor operational stability and efficiency decline at high current density (efficiency roll-off) limit their commercialization. Unlike Fluorescent OLEDs (<b>FOLED)</b> in which singlet excitons are responsible for the device emission, PHOLEDs utilize both singlet and triplet excitons for the emission. However, triplet excitons have much longer lifetime than their counterparts and they can be quenched by two bimolecular interactions (i. e. Triplet-Triplet Annihilation (TTA) and Triplet-Polaron Quenching (TPQ)). These two processes are of particular interests in PHOLEDs, since they directly compete with the radiative relaxation of triplet excitons and therefore, they can considerably reduce the device efficiency. The overall interest of this thesis is to identify and investigate the physical phenomena associated with the efficiency roll-off and electroluminescence degradation in PHOLEDs. This work particularly focuses on understanding the underlying mechanisms associated with TTA and TPQ and their roles in the efficiency roll-off and electroluminescence degradation through the study of delayed electroluminescence. It is found that efficiency loss due to TPQ is mainly caused by charges within the bulk of the emission layer (EML) rather than by charges at the hole transport layer (HTL) /EML interface. Charges on the guest rather than those on the host are found to be the most efficient in quenching excitons, revealing that guest polaronic species are the most detrimental to device efficiency. In addition, recombination of electrons and holes on the host material generally leads to higher device efficiency in comparison to the case where recombination happens on the guest material. Although electron-hole recombination on the host tends to produce higher device efficiency, host e-h recombination is generally also associated with significant efficiency roll-off due to the quenching of the host triplet excitons primarily as a result of host-host TTA. Furthermore, results from the study of devices with various guest concentrations reveals that as the concentration of the guest molecules increases and the creation of host triplet excitons subsides (since most e-h recombination occurs on the guest) host-host TTA decreases, hence also the efficiency roll-off. In such case, quenching is mostly caused by polarons residing on guest sites. At optimum guest concentrations (~ 8 % Vol.), a balance between host e-h recombination and guest e-h recombination is reached, and thus also minimal TTA and TPQ. Based on the findings from the investigation of efficiency roll-off during short-term device operation, we extended our study to understand the mechanisms associated with the gradual efficiency loss in the devices during long-term operation. Two distinctive degradation mechanisms are observed in PHOLEDs, depending on whether the device contains a hole blocking layer (HBL) or not. For a device without a HBL, excess holes penetrate into the electron transport layer (ETL), and lead to the deterioration of the ETL adjacent to the interface of the emitting layer. The lower electron transport capacity of the degraded ETL alters the balance in hole/electron injection into the emitting layer, and results in a decrease in the luminescence efficiency of the PHOLEDs. For a device with a HBL, on the other hand, holes accumulate and become trapped in the emitting layer, and result in a decrease in the luminescence efficiency of the PHOLEDs, due to their role in acting as exciton quenchers or as non-radiative charge recombination centers. Furthermore, the results show a strong correlation between the extent of hole blockage capacity of the HBL and the deterioration in device EL efficiency, pointing to the major role that the build-up of hole space charges in the emitting layer plays in EL degradation. In this case, gradual increase of trapped charges in the EML enhances the TPQ process and hence exciton quenching manifesting as a reduction of TTA. In addition, gradual increase in driving voltage often observed with prolonged electrical driving of PHOLEDs is mainly governed by the accumulation of holes at this interface. Reducing the build-up of hole space charges in this region, for example, by means of eliminating guest molecules from the vicinity of the interface, leads to a significant improvement in the stability of PHOLED driving voltage...|$|E
