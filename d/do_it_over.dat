5|$|This {{decision}} {{may cause}} regret in some men and women. Of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation, about 5% regret their decision, {{as compared with}} 20% of women aged under 30. By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage. In a survey of biological parents, 9% stated {{they would not have}} had children if they were able to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> again.|$|E
25|$|Like other intelligentsia, Christian {{leaders were}} {{sometimes}} persecuted for their anti-Nazi political activities. Between 1939 and 1945, an estimated 3,000 members, 18% of the Polish clergy, were murdered for their suspected {{ties to the}} Polish Resistance or left-wing groups, or for sheltering Jews (punishable by death). Outside mainstream Christianity, Jehovah's Witnesses were targets of Nazi Persecution, for their refusal to swear allegiance to the Nazi government. Many Jehovah's Witnesses were {{given the chance to}} swear allegiance to the state, but few agreed to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Over</b> 12,000 Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to concentration camps, and an estimated 2,500–5,000 died.|$|E
25|$|With no {{two-point}} conversion option (that {{would not}} be adopted by the league until 1993), Cleveland needed two scores to come back. Pagel led the Browns 71 yards to score on his 2-yard touchdown pass to Slaughter, cutting the score to 24–23 with 31 seconds left. Cleveland attempted an onside kick, which they failed to recover, but got another chance due to an Oilers penalty. Then the Browns recovered, but had to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> again due to a penalty against them. Finally on the third try, Cleveland was penalized for touching the ball before it went 10 yards, resulting in a penalty that gave Houston the ball and the win.|$|E

25|$|Immigrants {{are likely}} to move to and live in areas {{populated}} by people with similar backgrounds. This phenomenon has held true {{throughout the history of}} immigration to the United States. Seven out of ten immigrants surveyed by Public Agenda in 2009 said they intended to make the U.S. their permanent home, and 71% said if they could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> again they would still come to the US. In the same study, 76% of immigrants say the government has become stricter on enforcing immigration laws since the September 11, 2001 attacks ("9/11"), and 24% report that they personally have experienced some or a great deal of discrimination.|$|E
500|$|Gates was an {{executive}} who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, the managers described him being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk. He interrupted presentations with such comments as [...] "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!" [...] and [...] "Why don't {{you just give}} up your options and join the Peace Corps?" [...] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.

Having selected {{him on the}} basis of his performance as John Wilder in the television series The Plane Makers (1963–65) and The Power Game (1965–70), Anderson stated that Wymark's acting impressed him as much as Hendry's, but also that his similar drinking habits resulted in slurred lines on set. During the filming of one scene, Wymark [...] "had to list these explanations... and on take after take he couldn't remember that 'two' followed 'one'. We had to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> and over again." [...] Archer and Hearn identify Wymark's portrayal of Webb, a character described as [...] "John Wilder (2069 model)" [...] in publicity material, as the dominant performance of the film. The draft script describes Webb as a former British Minister of Technology, who is now romantically involved with his secretary, Pam Kirby.|$|E

In the few days preceding the landing, Karch commented that the weather was the worst that he had experienced.

When this was queried, he replied [...] "...if I had to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>over,</b> that picture {{would have been the}} same.

2500|$|With the Leafs {{falling out}} of playoff {{contention}} once more {{towards the end of}} the season and Sundin's contract set to expire, Sundin was the focus of numerous trade rumours as the 26 February NHL trade deadline approached. Maple Leafs management requested that Sundin waive his no-trade clause in order for the team to acquire potential young talent and/or draft picks to secure the team's future. [...] On 25 February, however, he stated that he would not waive his no-trade clause, stating that he did not believe in being a [...] "rental player" [...] and that if he won the Stanley Cup, he wanted to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> the course of an entire season. [...] He remained with the club and, with 78 points, marked the fourth consecutive year and 12 of 13 years as the Maple Leafs' leading scorer.|$|E
