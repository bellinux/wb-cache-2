In the 2010/2011 marketing year, about 29.1 million tonnes of DDGS were fed to US livestock and poultry. Because starch utilization in fermentation for ethanol production leaves other grain constituents more concentrated in the residue, the feed value per kg of DDGS, with regard to ruminant-metabolizable energy and protein, exceeds that of the grain.

5000|$|The {{production}} of fuel ethanol from corn in the United States is controversial {{for a few}} reasons. Production of ethanol from corn is 5 to 6 times less efficient than producing it from sugarcane. The reason that corn has been notoriously used for ethanol production is because farmers are either paid to destroy crops or to not grow corn crops. Another {{reason is that the}} cost of processing and transporting raw corn can be more expensive than transporting and processing it in to ethanol fuel. Corn production is highly dependent upon government subsidies, so naturally ethanol derived from corn is also highly dependent on government subsidies. Contrary to what most would claim, ethanol is not a food-versus-fuel issue. Corn, along with other crops that have been distilled are still a usable food source for cattle.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effect of calving season and cow wintering systems on cow and calf performance and economics from conception to slaughter, the effect of supplementing steers <b>dried</b> <b>distillers</b> <b>grains</b> while grazing cool season dominated meadow, and a meta-analysis was conducted {{to determine the effect}} supplementing <b>dried</b> <b>distillers</b> <b>grains</b> to cattle in forage based growing systems. In the first experiment, cows were bred to calve in spring, summer or fall. Calves from each system were managed as calf-feds or yearlings and followed through finishing. Altering calving season impacted cow BW and BCS but did not affect re-breeding performance or the percent of cows to calve. However, fall calving cows produced fewer weaned calves compared to spring and summer calving cows. In addition, there was a significant effect of calving season on calf finishing performance and economics. Wintering system did not affect performance or profitability of cow systems. The second study evaluated dried distillers grain supplementation to steers grazing cool season meadow. Results from this study suggest that lower levels of DDGS supplementation (0. 6 % BW) do not effect summer ADG or ending BW. However, when supplementation was increased (1. 2 % BW) ADG and ending BW were increased. In addition, supplementing <b>dried</b> <b>distillers</b> <b>grains</b> to calves grazing cool season meadow did not affect subsequent feedlot performance but BW at harvest was greater for steers supplemented <b>dried</b> <b>distillers</b> <b>grains.</b> The third study, evaluated <b>dried</b> <b>distillers</b> <b>grains</b> supplementation to cattle in forage based growing systems across multiple studies. Results from this study indicate that cattle supplemented <b>dried</b> <b>distillers</b> <b>grains</b> have greater gains during summer grazing.
