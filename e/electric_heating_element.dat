25|$|When flow {{starts from}} the {{uppermost}} outlet, cold water enters the tank at the bottom. This drop in temperature causes the thermostat {{to switch on}} the <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> {{at the bottom of}} the tank. When the water at the top of the tank is drawn off the hot water at the top is displaced by relatively cooler water, the top thermostat turns the top element on. When the flow stops, the elements stay on until their settings are met.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type is an <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> in the {{cylinder}} block, connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs. In this fashion, the heater element is immersed in the engine's coolant, which then keeps most of the engine warm. This type of heater does not come with a pump. They may also be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. Some heaters pump and circulate the engine coolant while heating, others only heat the still coolant in the reservoir.|$|E
25|$|A {{block heater}} warms {{the engine of}} an {{automobile}} in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs, or may be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. The block heater, first known as a head bolt heater, was invented in 1945 by Andrew Freeman in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the heating element of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt heater, which warmed the engine's water jacket and the oil film between cylinder heads and pistons. U.S. patent #2,487,326 was filed on November 4, 1946 and issued to Freeman on November 8, 1949.|$|E
5000|$|Blocks of feolite {{enclosing}} sheathed <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> {{to form a}} {{heat storage}} core, surrounded by thermal insulation, are used in storage heaters and storage radiators. [...] Because feolite blocks will conduct electricity, <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> must be electrically insulated when used with feolite storage.|$|R

5000|$|It can be {{considered}} as a very slow pulse-width modulation device. Although the device is similar in operation to a bimetallic switching thermostat, the device does not actually sense the temperature of the [...] "burner" [...] to be controlled, but uses the heating time of a very small <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> as an analog.|$|E
50|$|A kettle, {{sometimes}} called a tea kettle or teakettle, {{is a type}} of pot, typically metal, specialized for boiling water, with a lid, spout, and handle, or a small kitchen appliance of similar shape that functions in a self-contained manner.

50|$|An {{absorption}} refrigerator works differently from a compressor refrigerator, using {{a source of}} heat, such as combustion of liquefied petroleum gas, solar thermal energy or an <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element.</b> These heat sources are much quieter than the compressor motor in a typical refrigerator. A fan or pump {{might be the only}} mechanical moving parts; reliance on convection is considered impractical.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> are common, {{and used}} in {{portable}} plug-in electric heaters. Although they may supply several kilowatts of heat, such heaters are usually small as the electric element itself is small. Since heat is removed by the fan, {{the body of the}} heater {{does not need to be}} an effective heat sink.|$|R
5000|$|A {{muffle furnace}} (sometimes retort furnace in {{historical}} usage) is a furnace {{in which the}} subject material is isolated from the fuel {{and all of the}} products of combustion, including gases and flying ash. [...] After the development of high-temperature <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> and widespread electrification in developed countries, new muffle furnaces quickly moved to electric designs.|$|R
50|$|In 1922, Firmin's {{grandson}} Louis Desloge (from Jules Desloge) founded Watlow — {{the name}} alludes to low-watt heaters to replace steam heat — to manufacture <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> for the shoe industry.

50|$|Finally, a {{traditional}} type of heater {{known as a}} kotatsu is still widely used today. The kotatsu can come in multiple forms, but the more common is as an <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> attached to the underside of a low table: The table is typically surrounded by a light duvet-like cloth to keep the heat in. This type of table is common in the washitsu.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{branding}} irons utilize an <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> to heat a {{branding iron}} {{to the desired}} temperature. Electric branding irons come in many variations from irons designed to brand cattle, irons designed to mark wood and leather and models designed to be placed inside a drill press {{for the purposes of}} manufacturing. An Electric Branding Iron's temperature can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the flow of electricity.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, boilers powered by <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> began to replace wood and coal heated boilers. Moreover, {{it was during}} this period that lever {{machines}} radically changed the way of extracting coffee. This new technique forced water through coffee at a pressure of 9 atmospheres, thus obtaining a high-efficiency extraction of the aroma, and ultimately the crema caffè.|$|R
50|$|X7—Introduced in 1973. A {{very basic}} model only sold in Sweden and Denmark. The car had no {{self-repairing}} bumpers {{and it also}} had the same seats as the V4 Saabs, although these did not include <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>elements.</b> A simpler <b>heating</b> and ventilation system was also installed. The clock, cigarette lighter, glove compartment and the rear window defogger were also dropped.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> made of {{resistance}} wire {{also have a}} positive temperature coefficient of resistivity, but do not increase their resistance enough to be self-regulating; they are typically used with the wires red-hot. The ceramic, on the other hand, increases its resistance sharply at the Curie temperatures of the crystalline components, typically 120 degrees Celsius, and remains below 200 degrees Celsius, providing a significant safety advantage.|$|R
5000|$|The Japanese {{non-vented}} [...] "fan" [...] heater burns Kerosene gas and {{is known}} as a gasification type heater. The liquid Kerosene fuel is pre-heated via an <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> to vaporize the fuel. The resulting gas is collected and forced into the burn chamber where it is ignited and burns with a blue flame, similar to Propane. The unit is fuelled through a conventional side mount cartridge style tank just like other non-vented wick type radiant heaters.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method of}} removal {{is to apply}} steam to {{wallpaper}} in order to dissolve the wallpaper paste.A wallpaper steamer consists of a reservoir of water, an <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element,</b> and a hose to direct the steam at the wallpaper. The steam dissolves the wallpaper paste, allowing the wallpaper to be peeled off. However, {{care must be taken}} to prevent damage to the drywall underneath. Sometimes steaming can lead to the crumbling of underlying drywall or plaster, leaving an uneven surface to be repaired.|$|E
50|$|The heat {{required}} for boiling {{the water and}} supplying the steam {{can be derived from}} various sources, most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space (called variously combustion chamber, firebox). In some cases the heat source is a nuclear reactor, geothermal energy, solar energy or waste heat from an internal combustion engine or industrial process. In the case of model or toy steam engines, the heat source can be an <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A new {{filtering}} and regenerating trap for Diesel exhaust particulate is presented, {{taking the}} honeycomb ceramics and <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> as filtering components, burning out the smoke by the electrical divided-area heating, {{and reducing the}} regenerating time through the promoter. The experimental results indicate that its filtering efficiency is relatively high, up to 70 % ~ 90 %. All the more, its regenerating time is short...|$|R
50|$|Later diesels and {{electric}} locomotives were equipped with <b>Electric</b> Train <b>Heating</b> (ETH) apparatus, which supplied electrical {{power to the}} carriages to run <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> installed alongside the steam-heat apparatus, which was retained for use with older locomotives. Later carriage designs abolished the steam-heat apparatus, and made use of the ETH supply for heating, lighting, ventilation, air conditioning, fans, sockets and kitchen equipment in the train. In recognition of this ETH was eventually renamed Electric Train Supply (ETS).|$|R
2500|$|The {{heat pump}} is a {{refrigeration}} based appliance which reverses refrigerant flow between the {{indoor and outdoor}} coils. [...] This is done by energizing a reversing valve (also known as a [...] "4-way" [...] or [...] "change-over" [...] valve). [...] During cooling, the indoor coil is an evaporator removing heat from the indoor air and transferring it to the outdoor coil where it is rejected to the outdoor air. [...] During heating, the outdoor coil becomes the evaporator and heat {{is removed from the}} outdoor air and transferred to the indoor air through the indoor coil. [...] The reversing valve, controlled by the thermostat, causes the change-over from heat to cool. [...] Residential heat pump thermostats generally have an [...] "O" [...] terminal to energize the reversing valve in cooling. Some residential and many commercial heat pump thermostats use a [...] "B" [...] terminal to energize the reversing valve in heating. [...] The heating capacity of a heat pump decreases as outdoor temperatures fall. At some outdoor temperature (called the balance point) the ability of the refrigeration system to transfer heat into the building falls below the heating needs of the building. [...] A typical heat pump is fitted with <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> to supplement the refrigeration heat when the outdoor temperature is below this balance point. [...] Operation of the supplemental heat is controlled by a second stage heating contact in the heat pump thermostat. [...] During heating, the outdoor coil is operating at a temperature below the outdoor temperature and condensation on the coil may take place. [...] This condensation may then freeze onto the coil, reducing its heat transfer capacity. [...] Heat pumps therefore have a provision for occasional defrost of the outdoor coil. [...] This is done by reversing the cycle to the cooling mode, shutting off the outdoor fan, and energizing the <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>elements.</b> [...] The <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> in defrost mode is needed to keep the system from blowing cold air inside the building. [...] The elements are then used in the [...] "reheat" [...] function. Although the thermostat may indicate the system is in defrost and <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> is activated, the defrost function is not controlled by the thermostat. Since the <b>heat</b> pump has <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> <b>elements</b> for supplemental and reheats, the heat pump thermostat provides for use of the <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> <b>elements</b> should the refrigeration system fail. [...] This function is normally activated by an [...] "E" [...] terminal on the thermostat. [...] When in emergency heat, the thermostat makes no attempt to operate the compressor or outdoor fan.|$|R
