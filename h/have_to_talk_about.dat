500|$|In an {{interview}} for Complex, Beyoncé expressed dissatisfaction with contemporary radio. She intended 4 to help change that status, commenting, [...] "Figuring {{out a way to}} get R back on the radio is challenging... With 4, I tried to mix R from the '70s and the '90s with rock 'n' roll and a lot of horns to create something new and exciting. I wanted musical changes, bridges, vibrata, live instrumentation and classic songwriting." [...] On her website she wrote, [...] "The album is definitely an evolution. It's bolder than the music on my previous albums because I'm bolder.

[...] Beyoncé also sought to make more artistic music, rather than purely commercially oriented songs.|$|E
500|$|The Kite Runner {{has been}} accused of 'hindering' Western {{understanding}} of the Taliban by portraying its members as representatives of various social and doctrinal evils that the Taliban and their supporters do not consider typical and which they feel portray Taliban in an unfavourable light. Examples of this would be: Assef's pedophilia, Nazism, drug abuse, and sadism, {{and the fact that he}} is an executioner. The American Library Association reported that The Kite Runner was one of its most-challenged books of 2008, with multiple attempts to remove it from libraries due to its [...] "offensive language, sexually explicit , and unsuit age group." [...] Afghan American readers were particularly hostile towards the depiction of Pashtuns as oppressors and Hazaras as the oppressed. Hosseini responded in an interview, [...] "They never say I am speaking about things that are untrue. Their beef is, 'Why do you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> these things and embarrass us? Don't you love your country?'" ...|$|E

500|$|Stuttgart manager Joachim Löw was {{disappointed}} with the defeat, but remained confident about his future at the team, {{as well as the}} season: [...] "I'm calmly looking forward to the discussion. The club has to approach me. I have a contract until 1999. There must be some tough words. For me, the season has been positive". His word was also shared by Bobic who felt that his team were treated unfairly to the goal, also taking time to defend Löw: [...] "We need to talk about mistakes and learn from them, {{it does not mean that}} it is necessary to change the manager". He added: [...] "It is bitter to lose by such a goal". However, Verlaat dissented, and criticised Stuttgart's campaign: [...] "The club has to make up its mind finally. We could have done better this season. We carelessly squandered about eight games". Yakin agreed and offered his own comments: [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> many things, you cannot work together in the way it was this year." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "since the Six-Day War, Israeli {{politicians}} have repeatedly established {{a connection between}} European anti-Semitism {{and the fact that}} the Palestinians don't accept the founding of the State of Israel. But that's absurd! The Palestinians weren't primarily anti-Semitic. They just didn't accept their expulsion. But European anti-Semitism goes much further back than to the partition of Palestine and the establishment of Israel in 1948." [...] In response to a question from the interviewer, he said he conducted Wagner with the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra because, [...] "The musicians wanted it. I said: Sure, but we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it. It's a tricky decision." [...] When the interviewer asked if the initiative came from Arab musicians in the orchestra, he replied, [...] "On the contrary. It was the Israelis. The Israeli brass players." ...|$|E

Patriarch Amfilohije of Montenegro also blamed Wurst's victory for the floods. Irish television presenter for the BBC and former Eurovision BBC commentator Terry Wogan described that year's performance as a [...] "freak show". Reacting to these critics, Wurst stated [...] "It's so ridiculous! For me a perfect world would be when we don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> sexuality, where you're from, what you believe. Is this the worst thing {{in the mind of}} the politicians?" [...] She stated her desire to perform in Russia for the country's LGBT community, [...] "To tell them that they are not alone. The whole community around the world is standing behind them. They have to trust that if they open their mouth, then we can change something." [...] To a reporter from The Observer, she commented: [...] "It's funny that these people think I'm so powerful. I've figured out over the years, you can only hurt me if I love you; if I don't know you, I really don't care. There are people who want to kill me and I'm always like, 'Well, get in line, darling.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the members}} of the 110th House of Representatives were sworn in en masse, Ellison was the first Representative {{scheduled}} to have his picture taken with the new Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Though the Library of Congress is directly {{across the street from the}} Capitol, Thomas Jefferson’s Quran took fifteen minutes to arrive as it was brought through [...] "a long, winding underground route via tunnels...to protect the Quran from the elements". Once inside the Capitol the Quran was placed in a rectangular box, and handled with a green felt wrapper then guards ran the book through security x-ray machines. Ellison was impressed by the two-volume set, saying [...] "Look at that. That’s something else. Oh my God. This is great." [...] A few minutes later, Nancy Pelosi arrived and photos of a ceremonial reenactment oath were taken. There were so many of Ellison’s family in attendance that the ceremony was done in two takes. Among his family was his mother Clida Ellison who thought that the controversy had a positive effect, [...] "because many people in America are going to learn what the diversity of America is all about". Clida Ellison noted that she is a practicing Roman Catholic who goes to Mass every day. Ellison expressed his satisfaction that the controversy was behind him, [...] "It was good, we did it, it's over, and now it's time to get down to business...maybe we don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it so much anymore. Not that I'm complaining, but the pressing issues the country is facing are just a little bit more on my mind right now." ...|$|E

[...] He protested she could never bore him and she added: [...] "Oh I don't want compliments--I want the hard, the precious truth. An actress <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> herself.
