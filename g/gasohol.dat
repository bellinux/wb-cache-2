25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{biotechnology}} offered another possible {{solution to a}} societal crisis. The escalation {{in the price of}} oil in 1974 increased the cost of the Western world's energy tenfold. In response, the U.S. government promoted the production of <b>gasohol,</b> gasoline with 10 percent alcohol added, as an answer to the energy crisis. In 1979, when the Soviet Union sent troops to Afghanistan, the Carter administration cut off its supplies to agricultural produce in retaliation, creating a surplus of agriculture in the U.S. As a result, fermenting the agricultural surpluses to synthesize fuel seemed to be an economical solution to the shortage of oil threatened by the Iran-Iraq war. Before the new direction could be taken, however, the political wind changed again: the Reagan administration came to power in January 1981 and, with the declining oil prices of the 1980s, ended support for the <b>gasohol</b> industry before it was born.|$|E
25|$|The {{largest single}} use of ethanol is as an engine fuel and fuel additive. Brazil in {{particular}} relies heavily upon {{the use of}} ethanol as an engine fuel, {{due in part to}} its role as the globe's leading producer of ethanol. Gasoline sold in Brazil contains at least 25% anhydrous ethanol. Hydrous ethanol (about 95% ethanol and 5% water) can be used as fuel in more than 90% of new gasoline fueled cars sold in the country. Brazilian ethanol is produced from sugar cane and noted for high carbon sequestration. The US and many other countries primarily use E10 (10% ethanol, sometimes known as <b>gasohol)</b> and E85 (85% ethanol) ethanol/gasoline mixtures.|$|E
25|$|E10, a {{fuel mixture}} of 10% {{anhydrous}} ethanol and 90% gasoline sometimes called <b>gasohol,</b> {{can be used}} in the internal combustion engines of most modern automobiles and light-duty vehicles without need for any modification on the engine or fuel system. E10 blends are typically rated as being 2 to 3 octane numbers higher than regular gasoline and are approved for use in all new U.S. automobiles, and mandated in some areas for emissions and other reasons. The E10 blend and lower ethanol content mixtures have been used in several countries, and its use has been primarily driven by the several world energy shortages that have taken place since the 1973 oil crisis.|$|E
25|$|Biotechnology is the {{application}} of scientific and engineering principles to the processing of materials by biological agents to provide goods and services. From its inception, biotechnology has maintained {{a close relationship with}} society. Although now most often associated with the development of drugs, historically biotechnology has been principally associated with food, addressing such issues as malnutrition and famine. The history of biotechnology begins with zymotechnology, which commenced with a focus on brewing techniques for beer. By World War I, however, zymotechnology would expand to tackle larger industrial issues, and the potential of industrial fermentation gave rise to biotechnology. However, both the single-cell protein and <b>gasohol</b> projects failed to progress due to varying issues including public resistance, a changing economic scene, and shifts in political power.|$|E
25|$|MTBE was {{phased out}} in the US due to ground water {{contamination}} and the resulting regulations and lawsuits. Ethanol and, to a lesser extent, the ethanol-derived ETBE are common replacements. A common ethanol-gasoline mix of 10% ethanol mixed with gasoline is called <b>gasohol</b> or E10, and an ethanol-gasoline mix of 85% ethanol mixed with gasoline is called E85. The most extensive use of ethanol takes place in Brazil, where the ethanol is derived from sugarcane. In 2004, over 3.4 billion US gallons (2.8billion impgal/13 million m³) of ethanol was produced in the United States for fuel use, mostly from corn, and E85 is slowly becoming available {{in much of the}} United States, though many of the relatively few stations vending E85 are not open to the general public.|$|E
500|$|Since 1975, {{and as a}} {{response}} to the shock caused by the first oil crisis, the Brazilian government implemented the National Alcohol Program -Pró-Álcool- (...) , a nationwide program financed by the government to phase out automotive fuels derived from fossil fuels in favor of ethanol made from sugar cane. It began with a low blend of anhydrous alcohol with regular gasoline in 1976, and since July 2007 the mandatory blend is 25% of alcohol or <b>gasohol</b> E25. In 1979, and as {{a response}} to the second oil crisis, the first vehicle capable of running with pure hydrous ethanol (E100) was launched to the market, the Fiat 147, after testing with several prototypes developed by Fiat, Volkswagen, GM and Ford. The Brazilian government provided three important initial drivers for the ethanol industry: guaranteed purchases by the state-owned oil company Petrobras, low-interest loans for agro-industrial ethanol firms, and fixed gasoline and ethanol prices. After reaching more than 4 million cars and light trucks running on pure ethanol by the late 1980s, the use of E100-only vehicles sharply declined after increases in sugar prices produced shortages of ethanol fuel.|$|E

2500|$|Green {{vehicles}} can be {{powered by}} alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies and include hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, battery electric vehicles, compressed-air vehicles, hydrogen and fuel-cell vehicles, neat ethanol vehicles, flexible-fuel vehicles, natural gas vehicles, clean diesel vehicles, and some sources also include vehicles using blends of biodiesel and ethanol fuel or <b>gasohol.</b> In November 2016, with an EPA-rated fuel economy of 136 {{miles per gallon}} gasoline equivalent (mpg-e) (...) , the 2017 Hyundai Ioniq Electric became the most efficient EPA-certified vehicle considering all fuels and of all years, surpassing the 2014-2016 model year all-electric BMW i3.|$|E
2500|$|Increasingly, ethanol {{is being}} used at low {{concentrations}} (10% or less) as an additive in gasoline (<b>gasohol)</b> for motor fuels to increase the octane rating, lower pollutants, and reduce petroleum use (what is nowadays also known as [...] "biofuels" [...] and has been generating an intense debate regarding the human beings' necessity of new sources of energy, on the one hand, {{and the need to}} maintain, in regions such as Latin America, the food habits and culture which has been the essence of civilizations such as the one originated in Mesoamerica; the entry, January 2008, of maize among the commercial agreements of NAFTA has increased this debate, considering the bad labor conditions of workers in the fields, and mainly the fact that NAFTA [...] "opened the doors to the import of maize from the United States, where the farmers who grow it receive multimillion dollar subsidies and other government supports. (...) According to OXFAM UK, after NAFTA went into effect, the price of maize in Mexico fell 70% between 1994 and 2001. The number of farm jobs dropped as well: from 8.1 million in 1993 to 6.8 million in 2002. Many of those who found themselves without work were small-scale maize growers."). However, introduction in the northern latitudes of the US of , and not for human or animal consumption, may potentially alleviate this.|$|E
