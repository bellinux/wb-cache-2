50|$|Alpha-particle {{spectroscopy}} is {{a method}} of measuring the radionuclides based on emission of α particles. They can be measured {{by a variety of}} detectors, including liquid scintillation counters, gas ionization detectors, and ion-implanted silicon semiconductor detectors. Typical alpha-particle spectrometers have low backgrounds and measure particles ranging from 3 to 10 MeV. Radionuclides that decay through α emission tend to eject α particles with <b>discrete,</b> <b>characteristic</b> energies between 4 and 6 MeV. These energies become attenuated as they pass through the layers of sample. Increasing the distance between the source and the detector can lead to improved resolution, but decreased particle detection.|$|E

The TPJ and precuneus areas are known to be involved in mentalizing and are more strongly activated during processing of Theory of Mind cartoons compared to visual puns and semantic cartoons.|$|E

It is now well established that these waves are composed of elementary stochastic release events (calcium puffs) from spatially localised calcium stores. Here we develop a mathematical model of calcium release based upon a stochastic generalisation of the fire-diffuse-fire (FDF) threshold model for calcium release. Our model retains the <b>discrete</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the FDF model (spatially localised stores) but also incorporates a notion of release probability, via the introduction of threshold noise. It is possible to identify a critical level of noise defining a non-equilibrium phase-transition between abortive and propagating waves.

The ability of the behavioral programming approach to describe independent simultaneous aspects of behavior in a modular and incremental manner, which aligns with how people often specify requirements, is shown to complement the intuitive nature of fuzzy logic.

40|$|In {{the present}} work {{we deal with}} the {{stability}} of the space-time discontinuous Galerkin method applied to non-stationary, nonlinear convection - diffusion problems. Discontinuous Galerkin method is a very efficient tool for numerical solution of partial differential equations, combines the advantages of the finite element method (polynomial approximations of high order of accuracy) and the finite volume method (discontinuous approximations). After the formulation of the continuous problem its discretization in space and time is described. In the formulation of the discontinuous Galerkin method the non-symmetric, symmetric and incomplete version of discretization of the diffusion term is used and there are added penalty terms to the scheme also. In the third chapter are estimated individual terms of the previously derived approximate solution by special norms. Using the concept of <b>discrete</b> <b>characteristic</b> functions and the discrete Gronwall lemma, it is shown that the analyzed scheme is unconditionally stable.

The 10 th Consensus Conference of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) suggested that combining AKI biomarkers would provide better precision for AKI course prognostication. ObjectivesThis {{study investigated the}} value of combining a functional damage biomarker (plasma cystatin C [pCysC]) with a tubular damage biomarker (urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [uNGAL]), forming a composite biomarker for prediction of <b>discrete</b> <b>characteristics</b> of AKI. MethodsData from 345 children after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were analyzed. Severe AKI was defined as Kidney Disease Global Outcomes Initiative stages 2 to 3 (≥ 100 % ΔSCr) within 7 days of CPB. Persistent AKI lasted > 2 days. SCr in reversible AKI returned to baseline ≤ 48 h after CPB. The composite of uNGAL (> 200 ng/mg urine Cr = positive [+]) and pCysC (> 0. 8 mg/l = positive [+]), uNGAL+/pCysC+, measured 2 h after CPB initiation, was compared to ΔSCr increases of ≥ 50 % for correlation with AKI characteristics by using predictive probabilities, likelihood ratios (LR), and area under the curve receiver operating curve (AUC-ROC) values. ResultsSevere AKI occurred in 18 % of patients. The composite uNGAL+/pCysC+ demonstrated a greater likelihood than ΔSCr for severe AKI (+LR: 34. 2 [13. 0 : 94. 0] vs. 3. 8 [1. 9 : 7. 2]) and persistent AKI (+LR: 15. 6 [8. 8 : 27. 5] versus 4. 5 [2. 3 : 8. 8]). In AKI patients, the uNGAL−/pCysC+ composite was superior to ΔSCr for prediction of transient AKI. Biomarker composites carried greater probability for specific outcomes than ΔSCr strata.

40|$|According to the {{experimental}} results and the basic concept that the capacitive contribution of the coating/metal system to EIS can reflect the change occurring at interface sensitively, the quantitative relationship between the adhesion and the analytical result of EIS is established. The approach is using the transmission line model (CR circuit) to obtain the discrete capacitance values, analyzing the physical meaning of the slope at the region in which the discrete capacitances change linearly with the <b>discrete</b> <b>characteristic</b> frequency. The data handling method is also given in detail. The relationship is validated by experiments. The results show that under certain conditions, the slopes are mainly determined by the speed of instantaneous delamination at organic coating/metal interface and are not influenced by the corrosion product built up at the artificial defect, so they have good reproducibility despite the EIS of duplicate samples showing very different configuration.
