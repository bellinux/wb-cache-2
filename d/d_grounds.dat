RT-PCR verified expression of the transgene in skeletal muscle but not in the liver of 1 - and 21 -day old heterozygote transgenic mice. The concentration of endogenous mouse IGF-I, measured by an immunoassay which does not detect human IGF-I, was not significantly different between transgenic mice and wild-type littermates (9. 5 +/- 0. 8 and 13. 3 +/- 1. 9 ng/g in muscle; 158. 3 +/- 18. 6 and 132. 9 +/- 33. 1 ng/ml in plasma, respectively). In contrast, quantitation with antibodies to human IGF-I showed an increase in IGF-I of about 100 ng/ml in plasma and 150 ng/g in muscle of transgenic mice at 6 months of age. Transgenic males, compared to their age matched wild-type littermates, had a significantly higher body weight (38. 6 +/- 0. 53 g vs. 35. 8 +/- 0. 64 g at 6 months of age; P < 0. 001), dry fat-free carcass mass (5. 51 +/- 0. 085 vs. 5. 08 +/- 0. 092 g; P < 0. 001) and myofibrillar protein mass (1. 62 +/- 0. 045 vs. 1. 49 +/- 0. 048 g; P < 0. 05), although the fractional content of fat in the carcass was lower (167 +/- 7. 0 vs. 197 +/- 7. 7 g/kg wet weight) in transgenic animals. There was no evidence of muscle hypertrophy and no change in the proportion of slow type I myofibres in the limb muscles of Rskalpha-actin/hIGF-I transgenic mice at 3 or 6 months of age. Phenotypic changes in Rskalpha-actin/hIGF-I mice are likely to be due to systemic as well as autocrine/paracrine effects of overproduction of IGF-I due to expression of the human IGF-I transgene. The effect of muscle specific over-expression of Rskalpha-actin/hIGF-I transgene was tested on: (i) muscle regeneration in auto-transplanted whole muscle grafts; (ii) myofibre atrophy following sciatic nerve transection; and (iii) sarolemmal damage and myofibre necrosis in dystrophic mdx muscle. No beneficial effect of muscle specific over-expression of Rskalpha-actin/hIGF-I transgene was seen in these three experimental models. T. Shavlakadze, J. M. Boswell, D. W. Burt, E. A. Asante, F. M.

40|$|In Europe. the {{interest}} in sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) as a culture fish is fast increasing. This results in a rapid expansion of sea bass culture and of that of other marine fish species. such as seabream (Sparus aurata) and turbot (Scophtalmus maximus). In 1983 a research project was started, {{with the aim of}} culturing sea bass in the thermal effluents of the nuclear power station at Doel. In this way the possibility of producing valuable proteins is created {{while at the same time}} thermal effluents, normally dumped as waste heat, can be put to good use. The biology of the sea bass. In the Atlantic Ocean, the distribution area for sea bass ranges from Marocco to Norway. It is also found in the entire Mediterranean sea. The species has only one reproductive period, independent of the latitude. Spawning usually occurs in the littoral zone, in water with a salinity of above 30 promille. The juvenile stages, however, are mostly found in brackish, shallow waters, which function as "nursery grounds" due to their rich food supplies. This food mainly consists of invertebrates and, although some adult piscivore sea bass can be found, crustaceans remain the most important food items. Sea bass are very euryhaline and eurytherm, which has been experimentally determined and which can also be concluded from their local and geographical distribution. Sea bass as culture fish. Although sea bass culture only became popular in the eighties, a strong interest in the technique has developed owing to the high quality of the meat yielded and its subsequent high market value. The extensive culture is mainly situated in Italy where, in the "'allicultura", 700 tons are harvested yearly. However, while during cold winter months mortality is high, the yield per surface unit in extensive culture is limited. For this reason nowadays more interest, research and money are invested in the intensive culture system where densities up to 60 kg/m² are obtained. Besides the less applied pond culture, net cages and tanks are mainly used in intensive sea bass culture, depending on the suitability of the site. Both culture methods have advantages and disadvantages. Culture in tanks allows a better control of the fish population and the output per m² is higher than that in cages. However, financial investments for cage culture are much lower when compared to tank culture. In Europe the most important sea bass producing countries are France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Yougoslavia. Together they produce about 6000 tons of sea bass and sea bream per year. The high prices which can rise to 600 Bfr/kg, and which can show a yearly increase of about 20 %, are expected to stabilize in the near future. A decrease, however, is not to be expected because supply of fry is very limited and prevents a fast increase of production. A direct consequence of the shortage of juveniles is their high price, which rises to above 35 Bfr/piece. The pilot plant at Doel. The first culture experiments with sea bass in our country date from 1982 and were performed at the Zoological Institute of the K. U. Leuven. Due to a number of problems inherent to the recirculation system, which was used in this experiment, we started in 1983 by building a pilot installation for the culture of sea bass and eel on the K. C. <b>D.</b> <b>grounds.</b> When this installation was completed in 1985, the total effective water surface was 90 m², divided over 4 round and 6 square tanks. The water supply is derived from the River Scheldt, from the cooling tower and from the condenser circulation, in order to optimize the temperature and oxygen concentration of the culture water in the tanks throughout the year. In the tanks, the water is renewed once an hour; it leaves the tank through a central exit, which is constructed in such a way that, during the cleaning process, all the silt deposit is removed. Each tank is provided with extra aeration and an automatic feeding system (EWOS Multic feeder). The water tempe...|$|E

All target chromophores with systematically varied π-linker structure were further investigated by electrochemistry, absorption measurements, and EFISH experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations. Based on electrochemical and photophysical measurements, when a polarizable 2, 5 -thienylene moiety is embedded into the chromophore π-backbone the highest intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) is observed. Benzene, pyrimidine, and pyridazine derivatives exhibit lower polarizability and extent of the ICT across these π-linkers. The elongation of the π-conjugated system via additional ethenylene linker results in a significant reduction of the HOMO-LUMO gap and an enhancement of the NLO response. Whereas it does not significantly influence electrochemical and linear optical properties, the orientation of the pyrimidine ring seems to be a key parameter on the μβ value due to significant variation of the dipolar moment (μ) value. In 2 a and 2 c, pyrimidine is oriented to behave as an acceptor and thus generate dipolar molecule with μ above 5 D, whereas in 2 b and 2 <b>d</b> <b>ground</b> state dipole moment is significantly reduced.

For this reason, enterprise networks typically attract the most determined of attackers. These attackers are prone to using the most novel and difficult-to-detect approaches so that they may have a high probability of success and continue operating undetected. Many existing network security approaches that fall under the category of intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are able to detect classes of attacks that are well-known. While these approaches are effective for filtering out routine attacks in automated fashion, they are ill-suited for detecting the types of novel tactics and zero-day exploits that are increasingly used against the enterprise. In this thesis, a solution is presented that augments existing security measures to provide enhanced coverage of novel attacks in conjunction with what is already provided by traditional IDS and IPS. The approach enables honeypots, a class of tech- nique that observes novel attacks by luring an attacker to perform malicious activity on a system having no production value, to be deployed in a turn-key fashion and at large scale on enterprise networks. In spite of the honeypot’s efficacy against tar- geted attacks, organizations can seldom afford to devote capital and IT manpower to integrating them into their security posture. Furthermore, misconfigured honeypots can actually weaken an organization’s security posture by giving the attacker a stag- <b>ing</b> <b>ground</b> on which to perform further attacks. A turn-key approach is needed for organizations to use honeypots to trap, observe, and mitigate novel targeted attacks. Ph. D...|$|R

X-ray crystal structures of the free ligand, Hapsbz and the complexes, [Cu(apsbz) (NO) ], [Cu(apsme) (NCS) ] and [Cu(apsme) Cl] have been determined. In the solid state, the Schiff base, Hapsbz remains in its thione tautomeric form with the thione sulfur atom trans to the azomethine nitrogen atom. X-ray diffraction shows that the [Cu(apsbz) (NO) ] complex is a novel coordination polymer in {{which one of the}} nitrogen atoms of the pyrazine ring bridges two adjacent copper(II) ions. The Schiff base is coordinated to the copper(II) ion in its iminothiolate form via the thiolate sulfur atom, the azomethine nitrogen atom and one of the pyrazine nitrogen atoms, the overall geometry of each copper atom in the polymer being close to a square-pyramid. The complexes, [Cu(apsme) X] (X = NCS, Cl) are dimers in which each copper atom adopts a five-coordinate near square-pyramidal geometry with an NS coordination environment. The Schiff base coordinates as a uninegatively charged tridentate ligand chelating via the pyridine and azomethine nitrogen atoms and the thiolate sulfur atoms. A nitrogen atom of a unidentate thiocayanate or chloride ligand and a bridging sulfur atom from a second ligand completes the coordination sphere.

40|$|Thermoluminescence {{properties}} of the Eu 2 +-, R 3 +-doped calcium aluminate materials, CaAl 2 O 4 :Eu 2 +,R 3 +, were studied above room temperature. The trap depths were estimated {{with the aid of}} the preheating and initial rise methods. The seemingly simple glow curve of CaAl 2 O 4 :Eu 2 + peaking at ca. 80 degrees C was found to correspond to several traps. The Nd 3 + and Tm 3 + ions, which enhance most the intensity of the high-temperature TL peaks, form the most suitable traps for intense and long-lasting persistent luminescence, too. The location of the 4 f and 5 <b>d</b> <b>ground</b> levels of the R 3 + and R 2 + ions were deduced in relation to the band structure of CaAl 2 O 4. No clear correlation was found between the trap depths and the R 3 + or R 2 + level locations. The traps may thus involve more complex mechanisms than the simple charge transfer to (or from) the R 3 + ions. A new persistent luminescence mechanism presented is based on the photoionization of the electrons from Eu 2 + to the conduction band followed by the electron trapping to an oxygen vacancy, which is aggregated with a calcium vacancy and a R 3 + ion. The migration of the electron from one trap to another and also to the aggregated R 3 + ion forming R 2 + (or R 3 +-e-) is then occurring. The reverse process of a release of the electron from traps to Eu 2 + will produce the persistent luminescence. The ability of the R 3 + ions to trap electrons is probably based on the different reduction potentials and size of the R 3 + ions. Hole trapping to a calcium vacancy and/or the R 3 + ion may also occur. The mechanism presented can also explain why Na+, Sm 3 +, and Yb 3 + suppress the persistent luminescence...|$|R
40|$|I define quantum loop models whose {{degrees of}} freedom are Ising spins on the square lattice as in the toric code, but where the {{excitations}} should have non-abelian statistics. The inner product is topological, allowing a direct implementation of the anyonic fusion matrix on the lattice. It also makes deconfined anyons possible {{for a variety of}} values of the weight per loop <b>d</b> in the <b>ground</b> state. For d=√(2), a gapped non-abelian topological phase can occur with only four-spin interactions. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

The <b>ground</b> on at center and {{extending}} {{back to the}} left is covered in {{row after row of}} rectangular trays. Each tray is only partially filled with prunes and a set of tracks run on the right of them.

40|$|When adiabatically {{varied in}} time, certain {{one-dimensional}} band insulators {{allow for the}} quantized noiseless pumping of spin even {{in the presence of}} strong spin orbit scattering. These spin pumps are closely related to the quantum spin Hall system, and their properties are protected by a time-reversal restriction on the pumping cycle. In this paper we study pumps formed of one-dimensional insulators with a time-reversal restriction on the pumping cycle and a bulk energy gap which arises due to interactions. We find that the correlated gapped phase can lead to novel pumping properties. In particular, systems with <b>d</b> different <b>ground</b> states can give rise to d+ 1 different classes of spin pumps, including a trivial class which does not pump quantized spin and d non-trivial classes allowing for the pumping of quantized spin ħ/n on average per cycle, where 1 ≤ n≤ d. We discuss an example of a spin pump that transfers on average spin ħ/ 2 without transferring charge. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{superimposed}} pulsed {{bias voltage}} {{is composed of}} a <b>d.</b> c. <b>ground</b> voltage and a higher d. c. pulse voltage. The value of the pulse voltage is comparable with the level which is normally used for etching or sputtering: the ground voltage has {{the same level as}} used in conventional processes. Using a superimposed pulsed bias voltage in ion-assisted physical vapour deposition processes effects an additional ion bombardment to the surface with ions of higher energy. Both metal and reactive or neutral gas ions are accelerated to the surface. Basic principles and important charactristics of this newly developed process, such as surface processes and deposition results, are discussed. Because of the pulsing of the high voltage, the deposition temperature does not increase much. Adhesion, microstructure, morphology, internal stresses and film uniformity are influenced by these additional ion impacts. Different films (TiN on steel, copper on silicon or plastics) produced by arc and sputter techno logy are investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{superimposed}} pulse {{bias voltage}} {{is a tool}} to apply an additional ion bombardment during deposition in physical vapour deposition (PVD) processes. It is generated by {{the combination of a}} <b>d.</b> c. <b>ground</b> voltage and a higher d. c. pulse voltage. Using a superimposed pulse bias voltage in ion-assisted PVD processes effects an additional all-around ion bombardment on the surface with ions of higher energy. Both metal and reactive or inert-gas ions are accelerated to the surface. The basic principles and important characteristics of this newly developed process such as ion fluxes or deposition rates are shown. Because of pulsing the high voltage, the deposition temperature does not increase much. The adhesion, structure, morphology and internal stresses are influenced by these additional ion compacts. The columnar growth of the deposited films could be suppressed by using the superimposed pulse bias voltage without increasing the deposition temperature. Different metallizations (Cr and Cu) p roduced by arc and sputter ion plating are investigated. Carbon-fibre-reinforced epoxy are coated with PVD copper films for further treatment in electrochemical processes...|$|R
