5|$|Doubles: Adding {{a number}} to itself {{is related to}} {{counting}} by two and to multiplication. Doubles facts form a backbone for many related facts, and students find them relatively <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> grasp.|$|E
5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, loud and deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the {{phonograph}} record stylus to track the groove. Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings, and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> position or hide.|$|E
60|$|Ah, my friends, it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> know than <b>to</b> believe, and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> know than <b>to</b> do. <b>Easier</b> <b>to</b> talk of Abraham's faith {{than to have}} Abraham's faith. <b>Easier</b> <b>to</b> preach {{learned and}} {{orthodox}} sermons about how Abraham was justified by his faith, than to be justified ourselves by our own faith.|$|R

5|$|In these {{examples}} the automorphisms are <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> identify, {{but in general}} automorphism is not always obvious. The table at right shows {{the number of the}} essentially different Sudoku solution grids for all existing automorphisms.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to find P. fimbriata in the wild, as its shape and movements are well disguised. The Queensland variety is quite <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> raise, while the Northern Territory variety is quite troublesome to maintain.|$|E
5|$|More generally, {{whenever}} H is a bipartite graph, H-colorability {{is equivalent}} to K2-colorability (or K'0 / K'1-colorability when H is empty/edgeless), hence equally <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> decide.|$|E
5000|$|A {{functional}} programming model that promotes side-effect free {{systems that are}} <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> debug and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> run on multiple processors.|$|R

5|$|Onions have {{particularly}} large {{cells that}} are readily observed under low magnification. Forming a single layer of cells, the bulb epidermis is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> separate for educational, experimental, and breeding purposes.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{transitions}} {{are rather}} sharp (~10meV) and strong. Consequently, {{it is relatively}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> selectively excite nanotubes having certain (n,m) indices, {{as well as to}} detect optical signals from individual nanotubes.|$|E
5|$|Place: A {{distribution}} logistics is {{of crucial}} importance; main {{focus is on}} ecological packaging. Marketing local and seasonal products e.g. vegetables from regional farms is more <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> be marketed “green” than products imported.|$|E
50|$|Millar {{said that}} the game needed to be sped up a bit, <b>to</b> make it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> play, <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> referee, <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} and to produce more options for the players. The amendments concentrate on rucks and mauls, but include other aspects which help keep {{the ball in play}} and reduce stoppages for infringements and penalties.|$|R
5000|$|Mindfulness meditation, {{mindfulness}} of the breath, {{and related}} techniques, {{are intended to}} train attention {{for the sake of}} provoking insight. A wider, more flexible attention span makes it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> be aware of a situation, <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> be objective in emotionally or morally difficult situations, and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> achieve a state of responsive, creative awareness or [...] "flow".|$|R

5|$|Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, {{together}} {{with all other}} echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfishs produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these {{can be stored in}} a pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division by the use of 1-methyladenine. Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> handle, transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly. Asterina pectinifera, used as a model organism for this purpose, is resilient and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> breed and maintain in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The T-26 could cross 0.75m high {{vertical}} {{obstacles and}} 2.1m wide trenches, ford 0.8m deep water obstacles, cut 33cm thick trees and climb 40° gradients. Needless to say, it was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> drive.|$|E
5|$|The melody of {{the song}} is a memorable tune made <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> learn because of its {{combination}} of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody {{is similar to the}} patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.|$|E
40|$|Declarative {{knowledge}} describes {{facts and}} relationships within a domain. In theory, declarative {{knowledge can be}} <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> understand that procedural knowledge; eg. it can be <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> modify; <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> communicate <b>to</b> others; and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> reuse for different purposes. This paper tests that theory. After building a formal model of a commercial factory, we asked what else can we do with this model? Originally, the intent was to just to simulate the factory. Subsequently, {{we found that the}} simulation was useful for optimization and fault localization without additional architecture. ...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{enabling}} <b>to</b> produce texts <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> read, more comprehensible and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> retain, {{as well as}} {{with better}} vocabulary and style. Reasons for introducing a controlled language include: ...|$|R
50|$|With the Cartesian {{equation}} it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> check {{whether a}} point {{lies on the}} circle or not. With the parametric version it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> obtain points on a plot.|$|R
5|$|The {{remains of}} a {{complete}} male C. dirus are sometimes <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> identify compared to other Canis specimens because the baculum (penis bone) of the dire wolf {{is very different from}} that of all other living canids.|$|E
5|$|Copper is used {{to create}} stills for distilling spirits, for example to make whisky. It's {{malleability}} makes it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> bend into the various shapes required and allows considerable flexibility in the shaping of the still and associated pipework; the metal also reacts with undesirable sulfur-containing components in the vapor and distillate making for a cleaner product.|$|E
5|$|CsF is more soluble than sodium {{fluoride}} or potassium fluoride. It {{is available in}} anhydrous form, and if water has been absorbed it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> dry by heating at 100°C for two hours in vacuo. CsF reaches a vapor pressure of 1 kilopascal at 825°C, 10 kPa at 999°C, and 100 kPa at 1249°C.|$|E

50|$|A long narrow ceramic tray {{can also}} be used to rim a glass. They are <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> clean, <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> fill, {{reasonably}} sturdy and they lend themselves to the partial rim technique.|$|R
50|$|Having {{access to}} the {{subsystem}} internals in general makes the subsystem <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> understand but also <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> hack; for example, if a programmer can examine source code, weaknesses in an algorithm are much <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> discover. That makes white box testing much more effective than black box testing but considerably more difficult from the sophistication needed {{on the part of}} the tester to understand the subsystem.|$|R
5|$|David's {{activities}} and whereabouts after 1114 {{are not always}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> trace. He {{spent much of his}} time outside his principality, in England and in Normandy. Despite the death of his sister on 1 May 1118, David still possessed the favour of King Henry when his brother Alexander died in 1124, leaving Scotland without a king.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{aforementioned}} anti-cheating protocols, some participants {{felt that this}} was merely a display without effect. Mobile phones were commonly heard going off, particularly in the entourage of FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov. It was also regarded as fairly <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> circumvent the initial metal detectors simply by passing an object around them.|$|E
5|$|Even without {{managerial}} manipulation, quotas {{were very}} often low and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> overfulfill. Quotas had been lowered during the Second World War so that new workers {{would be able}} to fulfill their output expectations; in industries such as engineering, it was common for workers to double their basic pay through bonuses.|$|E
5|$|Another {{advantage}} of digital systems over analog {{is that their}} output is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> store in memory, i.e. two voltage states (high and low) are <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> store than a continuous range of states.|$|R
5|$|Modern {{replicas of}} {{traditional}} composite bows are commercially available; {{they are usually}} made with fibreglass or carbon on both belly and back, <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> mass-produce and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> take care of than traditional composite bows.|$|R
50|$|Knitting selvages {{makes the}} fabric <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> sew {{together}} {{than it would}} be otherwise. It also makes it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> pick up stitches later, and is a good basis for crocheting a further decorative edge.|$|R
