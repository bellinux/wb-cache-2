5|$|Greg Rucka and Michael Lark had {{previously}} collaborated on the comic series Gotham Central for DC Comics between 2002 and 2004 and various small projects for Marvel Comics {{in the years}} following. Lark {{wanted to work with}} Rucka on a creator-owned comic because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> at his best drawing the kind of stories Rucka writes.|$|E
5|$|Beginning work on Neon Bible {{immediately}} following a North American tour {{in support of}} the band's first album, Funeral, songwriter Win Butler, born in the United States but having lived in Canada for several years, said that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> observing his homeland from an outsider's point of view. The album is rooted in Americana themes, with Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Elvis Presley being cited as influences.|$|E
5|$|King was {{influential}} in deciding who would play Flagg {{in the television}} adaptation of The Stand. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the best villain he had ever created, and wanted the actor playing him to be right for the part. Director Mick Garris and the studios {{wanted to give the}} role to an established star such as Christopher Walken, James Woods, Willem Dafoe or Jeff Goldblum. King himself had suggested Robert Duvall in his introduction to the novel. Miguel Ferrer, who played Flagg's henchman in the film, was interested in playing the villain.|$|E

5|$|Mustaine {{has made}} {{numerous}} inflammatory {{statements in the}} press, usually regarding issues with former Metallica bandmates. The feud stemmed from his ejection from the band, how it was conducted, and disagreements on songwriting credits. Mustaine expressed his anger in the movie Some Kind of Monster, in a scene he later disapproved of as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> mischaracterized, and {{that it did not}} represent the full extent of what happened during the meeting.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{spent most}} of December in Iowa engaged in Town Halls. He briefly made a trip to Mountain View, California to make a speech before {{returning}} to the trails in Iowa. He participated in the last Democratic Debate before the primary season on December 13 in Johnson, Iowa. In this debate sponsored by the Des Moines Register, Dodd commented that Education was the most important issue to him in the campaign. He also made a statement on why <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the best choice for president and why he should receive the endorsement of the Des Moines Register, which ultimately went to Hillary Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Ford's {{first step}} into {{organised}} team football came with local Swansea based side Tower United, joining the club {{at the age}} of 15 as a full-back. Despite his young age, he played for the senior men's side in local amateur leagues where he attracted scouts from several clubs. The scouts included Albert Lindon of Arsenal, who invited Ford and teammate Frank Davies to attend a trial in Cardiff. Ford impressed enough to be offered an amateur contract with the London-based side, which was initially to be withheld until the end of hostilities in the Second World War. However, Ford himself rejected the contract as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> too young too move away from his home and family.|$|E

5|$|News that Marc Anthony was {{recording}} an English-language album {{began in}} 1996 when RMM executive Ralph Mercado mentioned the possibility following a joint-venture between RMM (Anthony's former record label) and MCA Records. Anthony {{said that he}} would not record in English until <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> ready to do so. After the release of his third studio album Contra la Corriente in 1997, disputes over business practices arose between him and Mercado. Anthony suspected that he was not receiving full payment from his record label for his recordings. Mercado would not allow Anthony to leave the record label because his contract committed Anthony to record four more albums for RMM.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1970s {{developments}} {{were reported}} on the project under the name James Bond of the Secret Service, but when producer Jack Schwartzman became involved and cleared a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project he brought on board scriptwriter Lorenzo Semple, Jr. to work on the screenplay. Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked Tom Mankiewicz, who had rewritten Diamonds Are Forever, to work on the script; however, Mankiewicz declined as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> under a moral obligation to Cubby Broccoli. Connery then hired British television writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the Writers Guild of America.|$|E
5|$|The Brotherhood then {{returned}} for tag team action with consecutive losses to RybAxel and the Usos; after the latter loss on April 21, dissension was teased between the brothers when Cody shoved Goldust and left by himself. After that, more tension was built up when Cody began frequently losing singles matches while Goldust frequently won; Goldust notably scored wins over Alberto Del Rio and Curtis Axel, two opponents which Cody lost to. When Cody managed {{a win over}} Damien Sandow in May, it was only because he resorted to cheating. The team disbanded at Payback on June 1 when they lost to RybAxel, with Cody telling Goldust {{to look for a}} new partner, after <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the weak link in the team. Cody then attempted to find a new tag team partner for Goldust, such as Sin Cara or R-Truth, but the new teams still lost their tag matches.|$|E

5|$|Another {{explanation}} surmised is that Wagner did not consent because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{not receiving}} just compensation from the ATC for his baseball card. Wagner {{had a history}} of being a tough negotiator; he had announced his retirement from baseball in December 1907, but returned shortly {{before the start of the}} 1908 baseball season after receiving a $10,000 contract, double his salary from the 1907 season. This theory has its flaws, however, since Wagner sent Gruber a check for $10 to compensate him for the fee ATC would have paid him if Wagner had given permission to create his baseball card. Michael O'Keeffe and Teri Thompson, authors of The Card: Collectors, Con Men, and the True Story of History's Most Desired Baseball Card, asked why Wagner would compensate Gruber for $10, a substantial amount of money at the time (approximately equal to $275 in 2016), if he refused authorization for monetary reasons. The ATC had already produced a number of T206 Honus Wagner baseball cards; the exact number is unknown, but is speculated to be between 50 and 200. They stopped production of the card, however, after Wagner denied authorization.|$|E
5|$|Following the Australian Open loss, del Potro missed several tournaments, {{including}} the Masters tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami, which were touted as potential return dates, {{due to the}} persistent wrist injury. Even though he withdrew from the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, he regained the world No. 4 ranking, due to Murray's early exit in the second round. He then withdrew from Barcelona and the Rome Masters. On 4 May, del Potro took the option of having an operation to fix the injury. On 19 May, del Potro {{said he would not}} defend his US Open title, but if all went well, he would appear after the event, targeting the Paris Masters as a possible comeback. However, on 22 July, the USTA stated that del Potro was expected to defend his US Open crown. The player himself confirmed that his comeback to the tour would be the Thailand Open and said nothing about the New York event. On 2 August, del Potro returned to the practice courts. A week {{before the start of the}} US Open, after practicing for two weeks, del Potro withdrew from the event, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not ready to compete at the highest level.|$|E
5|$|Keith Park, with {{endorsement}} from Dowding, {{opted for}} the opposite strategy. Park maintained that it was unimportant to inflict large losses on the Germans in comparison to safeguarding his own forces. Park believed the Germans would give up if they could not achieve their aim of air superiority. This, simply put, meant avoiding the destruction and or depletion of Fighter Command was the primary factor in air defence. This would be achieved by sending small numbers of fighters to intercept, minimising losses in the air. By remaining to offer undiminished and constant air opposition, the RAF ensured the Luftwaffe could not win. As long {{as some sort of}} cost was imposed before the enemy dropped his bombs and impaired the defence system, the RAF could remain intact to meet the threat again the next day. To this end, Park favoured the 10 bomber kills before the attack, rather than the 50 shot down after it. The strategy suggested an enemy would give up if <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> getting nowhere. For even while his losses remained moderate, it would be senseless to suffer those casualties for no return. Park and Dowding's strategy, under the circumstances, was the wiser choice.|$|E

25|$|Zimbabwe was at {{an all-time}} low at this point in time, and Ireland, soon after Zimbabwe were {{eliminated}} from the 2007 Cricket World Cup, retired from international cricket.

25|$|Michelangelo was {{intimidated by}} {{the scale of the}} commission, and made it known from the outset of Julius II's {{approach}} that he would prefer to decline. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> more of a sculptor than a painter, and was suspicious that such a large-scale project was being offered to him by enemies as a set-up for an inevitable fall. For Michelangelo, the project was a distraction from the major marble sculpture that had preoccupied him for the previous few years.|$|E
25|$|This made Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu, who {{was then}} MIC vice-{{president}}, bitter as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being sidelined. Samy Vellu {{was one of the}} five leaders who dared defy former president Tun V.T. Sambanthan and propel Manickavasagam to the presidency of the party.Subramaniam, then the secretary general of MIC, was hand-picked by Manickavasagam to become deputy president and succeed him. However, Samy Vellu fought back, literally, and in the 1977 party elections he managed to beat Subramaniam by a mere 26 votes to become the Deputy President of MIC.|$|E
25|$|On September 2, 2008, the UFC {{announced}} it had signed Couture {{to a new}} three-fight contract. On November 15, he returned at UFC 91 in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he lost the UFC Heavyweight Championship to Brock Lesnar. At first a closely contested match, Lesnar knocked Couture down {{in the second round}} and struck him with hammerfists for a TKO victory at 3:07. In a post-fight interview with Joe Rogan, Couture declared his desire to keep fighting and said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still becoming a better fighter, blaming the loss on his performance, not his age.|$|E
5000|$|Roth {{mentioned}} {{several times}} that his show was a work in progress, and that {{near the end of}} his run, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> getting the timing down. <b>He</b> also <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> trying to develop something [...] "unique", quite different from the generic [...] "morning zoo" [...] programs that would replace him.
