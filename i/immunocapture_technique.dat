A carbon substrate added to incubations of environmental samples will cause the growth of microorganisms that can utilize that substrate. These microorganisms will then incorporate BrdU into their DNA as they grow. Community DNA can then be isolated and BrdU-labeled DNA purified using an <b>immunocapture</b> <b>technique.</b> Subsequent sequencing of the labeled DNA can then be used to identify the microbial taxa that participated in the degradation of the added carbon source.|$|E
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{were produced}} to Streptomyces lividans spore surface antigens. One particular hybridoma cell line, 43 H 6, produced a monoclonal antibody that reacted exclusively with Streptomyces cluster group 21 in an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). Antibody 43 H 6 {{was found to be}} of subclass IgG 1, kappa light chain. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed that 43 H 6 recognized a major outer spore polypeptide of about 37000 Da. The epitope was stably maintained in S, lividans spores over at least seven sporulation cycles on laboratory medium and for at least 14 weeks in sterile soil systems. The species group specificity of antibody 43 H 6 was exploited in the development of an <b>immunocapture</b> <b>technique</b> for the isolation of streptomycetes from soil. Magnetic beads coated with antibody 43 H 6 were mixed with soil samples seeded with 5, lividans spores. Spore-bead complexes were recovered using magnets. Treatment of beads with blocking agents and the inclusion of detergents in the recovery system lessened non-specific binding of spores to beads and improved recovery. In buffer solutions decreasing the spore concentration increased the recovery values for a fixed bead concentration. At a spore concentration of 5 x 10 (7) ml(- 1) the recovery was 4. 3 % whilst at 5 x 10 (2) ml(- 1) it was 76 % for a fixed bead concentration of 0. 6 mg ml(- 1). Using a bead concentration of 2 mg per 10 g soil, approximately 30 % of the target spore population of 10 (6) c. f. u. was recovered from sterile soil and 4 % from non-sterile soil. This method offers a rapid means of selectively recovering and concentrating Streptomyces spares from soil samples...|$|E
40|$|AIM [...] To analyse the {{pathogenic}} {{mechanism of}} HIV related thrombocytopenia. METHODS [...] Forty one patients with thrombocytopenia and HIV- 1 infection were investigated over two years. Anticardiolipin antibodies were measured using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and antiplatelet antibodies were measured using an <b>immunocapture</b> <b>technique.</b> Tests for VDRL, C 3 and C 4, antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor were also {{carried out in}} all patients and 80 control subjects (HIV- 1 positive but non-thrombocytopenic). Indiumoxine labelled platelets were transfused in 13 patients. P 24 antigen were also measured in 12 bone marrow aspirates. RESULTS [...] Antiplatelet antibodies and circulating immune complexes were found exclusively in the thrombocytopenic group; values for antiplatelet antibodies and circulating immune complexes were both higher in homosexual and bisexual patients. Three kinds of pattern were observed using 111 In-labelled platelets: splenic (n = 10); hepatic (n = 2); and destruction of bone marrow in just one case. The two most influential factors in the sequestration pattern were antiplatelet antibodies in the splenic uptake and circulating immune complexes in the hepatic and marrow sequestration. All patients, except three, had decreased platelet recovery. In those patients with a CD 4 lymphocyte count of less than 200 x 10 (6) cells/l the recovery was clearly greater (53 %) than in patients who had more than 200 x 10 (6) /l (28 %). Finally, in seven of the 12 patients who were chosen for immunohistochemical study, p 24 antigen was detected in the megakaryocytes, verifying that HIV- 1 infects such cells. CONCLUSIONS [...] The pathogenic mechanism of HIV related thrombocytopenia is probably multifaceted. Antiplatelet antibodies and circulating immune complexes would cause peripheral destruction in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, in that order; and, on the other hand, {{there would be an}} ineffective immune thrombopoiesis and direct infection of the megakaryocytes which could cause a change in the function and maturity of these cells...|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} dielectrophoresis (DEP) on microfluidic immunocapture of prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer cells. We make novel measurements of these cancer cells' DEP response, and characterize the combination of DEP and <b>immunocapture</b> <b>techniques</b> {{as a function of}} shear stress in a Hele-Shaw flow cell with interdigitated electrodes. At the same applied electric field frequency, we demonstrate enhanced capture of cancer cells by attracting them to immunocapture surfaces with positive DEP and reduced nonspecific adhesion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by repelling them from immunocapture surfaces with negative DEP. Using an exponential capture model, we show that immunocapture performance is dependent on the applied DEP force sign and magnitude, cell and immunocapture surface chemistry, and shear stress experienced by cells flowing in the capture device. These data inform the simulation of cancer cell and blood cell capture probabilities to design future hybrid DEP and immunocapture device geometries with improved rare cell capture performance...|$|R
40|$|Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and NMO {{spectrum}} disorders (NMOSD) {{are associated}} with the disease-specific autoantibody aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4 -Ab), which is thought to be pathogenic. Some NMO/NMOSD patients do not have this antibody and may have different clinical and immuno-pathological disease characteristics, but previous clinical NMO/NMOSD studies have been confounded by inclusion of such patients. To define better the characteristics of AQP 4 -Ab disease, disease course, outcomes and predictors of disability were investigated in 106 AQP 4 -Ab positive NMO/NMOSD patients from the UK and Japan. AQP 4 -Ab positivity conferred a high risk of relapsing disease and substantial disability; age at disease onset and ethnicity were important predictors of disability type. Visual disability was more common in younger patients and those of Afro-Caribbean ethnicity whilst older patients and Caucasian patients were more at risk of motor disability. To determine whether disease characteristics were influenced by AQP 4 -Ab binding specificities, the differential binding of patient AQP 4 -Ab against the two main AQP 4 isoforms was investigated. Although the relative binding to the two isoforms differed between patients, there was no association between these differences and clinical features such as relapse type, severity, onset age and ethnicity. The clinical and in vitro characteristics of AQP 4 -Ab negative NMO/NMOSD patients were studied. It was shown that these patients represent an aetiologically heterogeneous group. Some have other inflammatory and infectious disorders, some have low levels of AQP 4 -Ab and a significant proportion have antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-Ab). Others have antibodies that bind to neurons or oligodendrocytes in primary cultures. Attempts to identify novel antigens by <b>immunocapture</b> <b>techniques</b> were made, but were not successful. Patients with MOG-Ab showed differences when compared to those with AQP 4 -Ab including higher proportion of males, younger age at disease onset and greater likelihood of conus involvement on imaging. Additionally, patients with MOG-Ab appear to have more favourable outcomes, with better improvement from the onset attack and a lower probability of subsequent relapses. In conclusion, the work in this thesis has shown that AQP 4 -Ab disease is not synonymous with the term NMO and that seronegative NMO/NMOSD patients represent a clinically and aetiologically heterogeneous group and should therefore be classed separately from those with AQP 4 -Ab. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between a virus and its host involves a complicated interplay between host restriction factors and immune system components and their viral antagonists. HIV- 1 {{has a number of}} accessory genes that have evolved to counteract specific host factors. This work focuses on the interaction of one of these accessory genes, Vpu and one of the proteins it counteracts- BST- 2. BST- 2 is an interferon-inducible protein that acts as a molecular tether, preventing the release of newly formed enveloped viruses including HIV- 1 from the cell. This dissertation focuses on three main questions. The first {{is whether or not the}} host restriction factor BST- 2 is located at virus- budding sites, where it seems likely to act, and whether it is actually incorporated into HIV- 1 virions during budding. I found, through electron microscopy, <b>immunocapture,</b> and immunoblot <b>techniques,</b> that BST- 2 is located at budding sites and is incorporated into virions. The second question entails what the mechanism of tethering and orientation of the BST- 2 protein in the tether is. The findings in this section suggest that the coiled-coil motif in the ectodomain of BST- 2 is indispensible for the tethering phenotype. A specific residue, L 70, that when mutated abolishes the ability of BST- 2 to tetramerize, contributes to tethering. Moreover, a parallel dimer model in which BST- 2 links the host cell and virion lipid bilayers was not supported, since enzymatic cleavage of the GPI-anchor of BST- 2 did not release tethered virions. The final goal of the research was to determine the role of BST- 2 during viral growth and spread in suspension cultures. By using T-cell lines as well as primary cultures of human lymphocytes, I found that Vpu-deficient HIV- 1 spreads more quickly than wild type HIV- 1, regardless of the presence or absence of BST- 2. These data suggest that Vpu's influence on viral growth rate is likely multifaceted and is not a direct reflection of its ability to counteract the restriction imposed by BST- 2. Moreover, the data suggest that the genetically conserved ability of HIV- 1 Vpu to affect the expression of BST- 2 might reflect activities of each protein that are not recapitulated in simple in vitro culture system...|$|R
