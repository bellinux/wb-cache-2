Two-phase aqueous foam {{was used as a}} coolant. Such coolant was considered, because our previous research showed that large heat transfer intensity may be reached even at small mass flow rate of the <b>foam.</b> <b>Spacing</b> among the centres of the tubes across the first in-line tube bundle was 0. 03 m and spacing along the bundle was 0. 03 m.

40|$|A compact {{windscreen}} {{has been}} conceived for a microphone {{of a type}} used outdoors to detect atmospheric infrasound {{from a variety of}} natural and manmade sources. Wind at the microphone site contaminates received infrasonic signals (defined here as sounds having frequencies < 20 Hz), because a microphone cannot distinguish between infrasonic pressures (which propagate at the speed of sound) and convective pressure fluctuations generated by wind turbulence. Hence, success in measurement of outdoor infrasound depends on effective screening of the microphone from the wind. The present compact windscreen is based on a principle: that infrasound at sufficiently large wavelength can penetrate any barrier of practical thickness. Thus, a windscreen having solid, non-porous walls can block convected pressure fluctuations from the wind while transmitting infrasonic acoustic waves. The transmission coefficient depends strongly upon the ratio between the acoustic impedance of the windscreen and that of air. Several materials have been found to have impedance ratios that render them suitable for use in constructing walls that have practical thicknesses and are capable of high transmission of infrasound.

40|$|General {{stochastic}} dynamics, {{developed in}} a framework of Feynman path integrals, have been applied to Lewinian field [...] theoretic psychodynamics, resulting {{in the development of}} a new concept of life [...] <b>space</b> <b>foam</b> (LSF) as a natural medium for motivational and cognitive psychodynamics. According to LSF formalisms, the classic Lewinian life space can be macroscopically represented as a smooth manifold with steady force-fields and behavioral paths, while at the microscopic level it is more realistically represented as a collection of wildly fluctuating force-fields, (loco) motion paths and local geometries (and topologies with holes). A set of least-action principles is used to model the smoothness of global, macro-level LSF paths, fields and geometry. To model the corresponding local, micro-level LSF structures, an adaptive path integral is used, defining a multi-phase and multi-path (multi-field and multi-geometry) transition process from intention to goal-driven action.

Our extended LSF model incorporates the notion of phase transitions and complements it with embedded geometrical chaos. To describe this LSF phase transition, a general path–integral is used, along the corresponding LSF topology change. As a result, our extended LSF model is able to rigorously represent co-action by two or more actors in the common LSF–manifold.

40|$|So far spin foam {{models are}} hardly {{understood}} beyond {{a few of}} their basic building blocks. To make progress on this question, we define analogue spin foam models, so called spin nets, for quantum groups SU(2) _k and examine their effective continuum dynamics via tensor network renormalization. In the refinement limit of this coarse graining procedure, we find a vast non-trivial fixed point structure beyond the degenerate and the BF phase. In comparison to previous work, we use fixed point intertwiners, inspired by Reisenberger's construction principle [1] and the recent work [2], as the initial parametrization. In this new parametrization fine tuning is not required in order to flow to these new fixed points. Encouragingly, each fixed point has an associated extended phase, which allows for the study of phase transitions in the future. Finally we also present an interpretation of spin nets in terms of melonic spin foams. The coarse graining flow of spin nets can thus be interpreted as describing the effective coupling between two spin <b>foam</b> vertices or <b>space</b> time atoms.

This paper presents the use of FRP material for the precast industry and more specifically Concrete Sandwich Panels typically used as bearing wall panels and building envelopes of many structures. The research program examines {{the use of a}} carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) material, configured as a grid and placed in composite action with rigid foam insulation, as the main shear transfer mechanism for precast concrete sandwich panels. The motivation for the use of these materials is in their ability to provide composite action between the two concrete wythes, allowing for greater structural capacity, higher thermal efficiency, and a longer service life. This study investigates the effect of several parameters believed to affect the shear flow capacity of the CGRID/foam insulation material mechanism, including the type of rigid insulating <b>foam,</b> the <b>spacing</b> between rows of CFRP grids, and the thickness of the foam insulation. A comprehensive experimental program was conducted to determine the characteristics of the shear transfer mechanism of the grid/insulation.
