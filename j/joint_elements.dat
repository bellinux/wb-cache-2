40|$|Abstract: Contact problem, which exists {{widely in}} {{mechanical}} engineering, civil engineering, manufacturing engineering, etc., {{is an extremely}} complicated nonlinear problem. It is usually solved by the finite element method. Unlike with the traditional finite element method, {{it is necessary to}} set up contact elements for the contact analysis. In the different types of contact elements, the Goodman <b>joint</b> <b>elements,</b> which cover the surface of contacted bodies with zero thickness, are widely used. However, there are some debates on the characteristics of the attached elements of the Goodman <b>joint</b> <b>elements.</b> For that this paper studies the type, matching, and meshing of the attached elements.

40|$|Key words: {{triangle}} element; crack propagation; joint element; numerical simulation. Abstract. In {{order to}} model the mechanical behavior of joints efficiently, a thin-layer tri-node <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> is constructed. The stiffness matrix of the element is derived in the paper. For it shares the common nodes with the original tri-node triangle <b>element,</b> the tri-node <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> can be applied {{to model the}} crack propagation without remeshing or mesh adjustment. Another advantage is that the cracked body is meshed without consideration of its geometry integrity and existence of the joints or pre-existed crack in the procedure of mesh generation, and then the triangular element intersected by the crack or joint is automatically transformed into the tri-node <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> to represent pre-existed cracks. These make the numerical simulation of crack propagation highly convenient and efficient. After CZM is chosen to model the crack tip, the mixed- energy simple criterion is used to determine whether the element is intersected by the extended crack or not, the extended crack is located in the model. By modeling the marble plates with two edge cracks subjected to the uniaxial compressive loads, it is shown that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results, which suggests that the present method is valid and feasible in modeling rock crack propagation...|$|R

Copyright © 2016 by the American Rock Mechanics AssociationIn this study, micro-mechanisms {{that govern}} the viscous and damage {{behavior}} of salt polycrystal during creep processes are investigated. A Finite Element model is designed with POROFIS, in which surface elements represent salt grains and <b>joint</b> <b>elements</b> represent inter-granular contacts. Microscopic observations of salt thin sections serve as a basis to design the mesh, which includes voids. We compare three strategies to predict microscopic damage in the salt polycrystal: (1) inter-granular damage represented by damage propagation in joint elements; (2) intra-granular damage represented by stiffness degradation in grain surface elements; (3) damage in both surface and <b>joint</b> <b>elements.</b> We simulate creep tests in conditions typical of Compressed Air Energy Storage. The three models capture polycrystal stiffness degradation and the initiation, propagation and coalescence of cracks that originate from geometric incompatibilities and local stress concentrations. The model with damageable joints presents a more ductile behavior and captures a smooth transition between steady state and tertiary state creep.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} numerical {{and experimental}} studies on joints. A formulation for the coupled analysis of thermo- hydro- mechanical problems in joints is presented. The work involves {{the establishment of}} equilibrium and mass and energy balance equations. Balance equations were formulated taking into account two phases: water and air. Once the <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> was implemented in Code_Bright computer code, it was then used to study some cases. The numerical simulation of hydraulic shear tests of roughness granite joints is presented. This allowed evaluating the coupling between permeability and the geometry of {{the opening of the}} joint. Then, a thermo-hydro-mechanical simulation of a large-scale nuclear waste repository was performed considering the <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> to model the interface between canister and bentonite. This example allowed evaluating the behaviour of the <b>joint</b> <b>element</b> when coupled to continuum elements. Then, other examples show how hydro-mechanical coupling affects the permeability and saturation of the joints and adjacent material. Finally, the gas flow through joints was also investigated. The experimental investigation focused on the effects of suction on the mechanical behaviour of rock joints. Laboratory tests were performed in a direct shear cell equipped with suction control. Suction was monitored using a vapour forced convection circuit controlled by an air pump that was connected to the shear cell. Once equilibrium conditions are achieved, the rock specimen is assumed to reach the Relative Humidity imposed by the flowing air at a given vapour concentration. Artificial joints of Lilla claystone were prepared. Joint roughness of varying intensity was created by carving the surfaces in contact in such a manner that rock ridges of different tip angles formed. These angles ranged from 0 º (smooth joint) to 45 º (very rough joint profile). The geometric profiles of the two surfaces in contact were initially positioned in a "matching" situation. Several tests were performed for different values of suction (200, 100 and 20 MPa) and for different values of vertical stress (30, 60 and 150 kPa). A constitutive model including the effects of suction and joint roughness is proposed to simulate the unsaturated behaviour of rock joints.
