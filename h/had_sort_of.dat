There was this moment where I felt like he <b>had</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> {{looked at her and}} reckoned that he had won in life. Like, 'I'm a champion. We won. Our love made us a winner.' They were married 60 years. I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb. You're on the cliff, you tip your hat to yourself and you go. That’s what it was for me in that moment when I witnessed it." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 30, 2010, the NBC network {{announced}} that {{an episode of}} 30 Rocks fifth season would be filmed and broadcast live on two occasions in the evening of October 14, 2010. The decision was made {{in part due to}} lagging ratings for all of NBC's Must-See TV line-up. The idea was originally conceived during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, when the cast performed two live versions of the season two episode [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] as a benefit at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. When asked by Entertainment Weekly the reason for doing a live episode, Fey said [...] " [...] was what made us {{think that it would be}} fun to do [...] And how far we've come... Now we're going to do it on TV." [...] In this same interview, Fey revealed that the episode would also be performed in front of a live audience. [...] "It will be exciting for us to do it for a live audience and see if we get live laughter." [...] Fey noted that the experience [...] "was so fun to feel the different timing of the show live and the audience response, which you just don't get in a single-camera show." [...] In another interview, Fey revealed that the staff have talked about doing a live show for years [...] "because we felt we <b>had</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> interesting personnel for it." [...] Following the conclusion of the writers' strike they spoke to NBC about performing live and attempted to film it during the fourth season; however, they were unable to schedule it. For the fifth season, the writing staff began planning the live performance and waited until McCarthy-Miller—a recurring 30 Rock director—was available to helm it. Fey and Carlock said in separate discussions that another decision to do this episode of 30 Rock was based on the cast having theater and improvisation experience. Alec Baldwin had previously performed in the East and West live broadcasts of the Will & Grace [...] premiere episode, [...] "Alive and Schticking".|$|E

According to Taylor, [...] "The guy <b>had</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> pinned me to the wall and was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about {{what he was going to}} do and his stuff with how John was {{interested}} and he was going to get in touch with John Lennon."

2500|$|On December 7, 1980, Taylor had an {{encounter}} with Mark David Chapman, who would assassinate John Lennon just one day later.

And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John." [...] The next night, Taylor, who lived in the next building from Lennon, heard the assassination occur. Taylor commented: [...] "I heard him shot—five, just as quick as you could pull the trigger, about five explosions." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, the United Nations {{stated that}} the rate of {{population}} growth was visibly diminishing due to the ongoing global demographic transition. If this trend continues, the rate of growth may diminish to zero by 2050, concurrent with a world population plateau of 9.2 billion. However, this {{is only one of many}} estimates published by the UN; in 2009, UN population projections for 2050 ranged between around 8 billion and 10.5 billion. An alternative scenario is given by the statistician Jorgen Randers, who argues that traditional projections insufficiently take into account the downward impact of global urbanization on fertility. Randers' [...] "most likely scenario" [...] reveals a peak in the world population in the early 2040s at about 8.1 billion people, followed by decline. Adrian Raftery, a University of Washington professor of statistics and of sociology, states that [...] "there’s a 70 percent probability the world population will not stabilize this century. Population, which <b>had</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> fallen off the world’s agenda, remains a very important issue." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band's {{insistence on}} {{recording}} live to tape, without click tracks or editing, {{was met with}} distaste by most producers they spoke to. One executive at Reprise suggested using American Idiot producer Rob Cavallo, {{in the name of}} commercial success. The band held out until they met someone willing to record analog, and with the right energy and philosophy, eventually choosing producer Roy Thomas Baker, who they considered [...] "a real soul mate." [...] Terry Date also contributed, and, according to Corgan, Date's production style helped the songs [...] "resonate on a physical level". The album was largely recorded in the home studio of former Catherine drummer (and D'arcy Wretzky's ex-husband) Kerry Brown, on the same 24-track tape recorder that 1995's Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness was recorded on—in fact, no computers were used for the recording of the album. As with the other Smashing Pumpkins albums, Zeitgeist was recorded in twelve-hour days, six or seven days a week, until it was finished. The mixing process also differed from previous albums'. According to Baker, [...] "everything <b>had</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> an on/off switch. So instead of having various degrees of volumes, we'd have the approach of, 'It's either on or it's not'".|$|E
2500|$|Ford avoided {{repetition}} {{not only}} of the work of others, but also of his own work. Where many writers make a name for themselves by developing a known style that repeats in many books, Ford always surprised with his ability to use a variety of styles that best suited the world, characters, and situations he had chosen to write about. (John Clute expressed this in 1993 The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction as [...] "Two decades into his career, there remains some sense that JMF remains unwilling or unable to create a definitive style or mode; but his originality is evident, a shifting feisty energy informs almost everything he writes, and that career is still young.") This might have limited his readership, however he was much respected by his fellow writers, editors, critics and fans. Robert Jordan, Ford's lifelong close friend, called Ford [...] "the best writer in America – bar none." [...] Neil Gaiman called Ford [...] "my best critic … the best writer I knew." [...] Patrick Nielsen Hayden said [...] "Most normal people had the slight sense that something large and super-intelligent and trans-human <b>had</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> flown over ... There would be a point where basically the plot would become so knotted and complex he would lose all of us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor had {{thoughts}} of retiring {{by the time}} he played the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro in January 1985. He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in Brazil at the time, buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians, and musically energized by the sounds and nature of Brazilian music. [...] "I <b>had...</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> bottomed-out in a drug habit, my marriage with Carly had dissolved, and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while," [...] he recalled in 1995. [...] "I sort of hit a low spot. I was asked to go down to Rio de Janeiro to play in this festival down there. We put the band together and went down and it was just an amazing response. I played to 300,000 people. They not only knew my music, they knew things about it and were interested in aspects of it that to that point had only interested me. To have that kind of validation right about then was really what I needed. It helped get me back on track." [...] The song [...] "Only a Dream in Rio" [...] was written in tribute to that night, with lines like I was there that very day and my heart came back alive. The October 1985 album, That's Why I'm Here, from which that song came, started a series of studio recordings that, while spaced further apart than his previous records, showed a more consistent level of quality and fewer covers, most notably the Buddy Holly song [...] "Everyday", released as a single reached No. 61. On the album track [...] "Only You," [...] the backing vocals were performed by an all star duo of Joni Mitchell and Don Henley.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--Found I was not {{absolutely}} needed in Washington so I only staid 24 hours, and am {{on my way}} home, now. I called at the White House, and got admission to Col.

I perceived that Mr. Rodgers took me for George Francis Train and had {{made up his mind}} not to let me get at the President; so at the end of half an hour I took my letter of introduction from the table and went away.
