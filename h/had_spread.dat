5|$|By {{the end of}} July 19, {{the strike}} <b>had</b> <b>spread</b> through major cities from Baltimore to Chicago. It {{involved}} multiple rail companies, and had grown to include a variety of mechanics, artisans, and other laborers. General violence threatened to break out in Pittsburgh and the city was blockaded.|$|E
5|$|Andrey Lugovoy {{has said}} he flew from London to Moscow on a 3 November flight. He stated he arrived in London on 31 October to attend the {{football}} match between Arsenal and CSKA Moscow on 1 November. When the news broke that a radioactive substance {{had been used to}} murder Litvinenko, a team of scientists rushed to find out how far the contamination <b>had</b> <b>spread.</b> It led them on a trail involving hundreds of people and dozens of locations.|$|E

25|$|Testicular {{cancer has}} one of the highest cure rates of all cancers with an average five-year {{survival}} rate of 95%. If the cancer <b>has</b> not <b>spread</b> outside the testicle, the 5-year survival is 99% while if it has grown into nearby structures or <b>has</b> <b>spread</b> to nearby lymph nodes, the rate is 96% and if it <b>has</b> <b>spread</b> to organs or lymph nodes away from the testicles, the 5-year survival is around 74%. Even for the relatively few cases in which cancer <b>has</b> <b>spread</b> widely, chemotherapy offers a cure rate of at least 80%.|$|R
5|$|Between 1906 and 1908, the Pentecostal message <b>had</b> <b>spread</b> among Christian and Missionary Alliance (CMA) {{churches and}} conferences. At first, it was greeted {{positively}} by the CMA leadership, but {{the doctrine of}} initial evidence divided the organization. Former CMA Pentecostal congregations in the Midwest and Northeast were left without oversight and began associating with the Apostolic Faith Movement and the Chicago Pentecostal missions.|$|E
5|$|By 1801 the {{population}} of the Minster-in-Sheppey parish, which included both Sheerness and the neighbouring town of Minster, reached 5,561. In 1816, one of the UK's first co-operative societies was started in Sheerness, chiefly to serve the dockyard workers and their families. The Sheerness Economical Society began as a co-operative bakery but expanded to produce and sell a range of goods. By the middle of the 20th century, the society <b>had</b> <b>spread</b> across the Isle of Sheppey and had been renamed the Sheerness and District Cooperative Society.|$|E
5|$|By 1886 {{the four}} threequarter system <b>had</b> <b>spread</b> {{throughout}} Wales. First instituted by Cardiff RFC in 1884, {{the system was}} designed to allow Cardiff centres Frank Hancock and Tom Williams {{to play at the}} same time, and involved dropping the ninth forward to include a second centre. Newport were reluctant to adopt this style of play, mainly due to Gould's excellent kicking and covering abilities, which allowed the club to continue with the advantage of the extra forward.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — For a given blocklength we {{determine}} the number of interleavers which <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> equal to two. Using this, we find out the probability that a randomly chosen interleaver <b>has</b> <b>spread</b> two. We show that as blocklength increases, this probability increases but very quickly converges to the value 1 − e − 2 ≈ 0. 8647. Subsequently, we determine a lower bound on the probability of an interleaver <b>having</b> <b>spread</b> at least s. We show that this lower bound converges to the value e − 2 (s− 2) 2, as the blocklength increases. I...|$|R
5|$|By {{the seventeenth}} century the fashion for {{portraiture}} <b>had</b> <b>spread</b> down the social order to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston. Adam de Colone, perhaps the son of Adrian Vanson and probably trained in the Netherlands, was working in England in the 1620s. In 1623 he painted his portrait of George Seaton, 3rd Earl of Winton and his sons and another of Seaton's wife Anne Hay with her two daughters.|$|E
5|$|Cynthia Lennon {{personally}} {{believed that}} Mardas invented {{the story about}} sexual impropriety to undermine the Maharishi's influence on the Beatles, as Mardas was always jealous of anyone having Lennon's attention. Harrison and McCartney later offered their apologies to the Maharishi (McCartney {{said that he did}} not believe the accusation at all). In 2010, Mardas issued a statement denying that he <b>had</b> <b>spread</b> rumours.|$|E

On 4 December 2008 the Zimbabwe government declared the outbreak to be a national emergency and asked for international aid.|$|E

5|$|In France, saffron {{production}} {{became very}} important in the 17th and 18th centuries, reaching a few tons. By then, saffron farming <b>had</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the entire Kingdom. Saffron was especially grown in Albigeois, Angoumois, Gascony, Gâtinais, Normandy, Périgord, Poitou, Provence, and Quercy. Its mysterious decline started during the 18th century, possibly due to pandemic fungal diseases destroying bulbs and crops, to particularly cold winters, and to competing market from the Mediterranean countries.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that cricket {{was introduced to the}} Americas and India before it <b>had</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the British Isles. For example, there is no record of cricket in Yorkshire, home of the English game's most successful club, until 1751. The earliest mentions of cricket in Ireland, Scotland and Wales occur even later in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City {{returned}} to the top flight at its first attempt, and in the following years Trautmann established himself {{as one of the}} best keepers in the league, playing in all but five of his club's next 250league matches. By 1952, his fame <b>had</b> <b>spread</b> to his home country, leading Schalke 04 to offer Manchester City £1,000 for his services. The offer was refused; the club responded that they thought Trautmann to be worth twenty times more.|$|E

5|$|Marley's last concert {{occurred}} at the Stanley Theater (now called The Benedum Center For The Performing Arts) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on 23 September 1980.

5|$|Shortly afterwards, Marley's health {{deteriorated}} as {{the cancer}} <b>had</b> <b>spread</b> throughout his body. The {{rest of the}} tour was cancelled and Marley sought treatment at the Bavarian clinic of Josef Issels, where he received an alternative cancer treatment called Issels treatment partly based on avoidance of certain foods, drinks, and other substances. After fighting the cancer without success for eight months Marley boarded a plane for his home in Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|The game reached Western Europe and Russia by {{at least}} three routes, the {{earliest}} being in the 9thcentury. By the year 1000, it <b>had</b> <b>spread</b> throughout Europe.

The search also revealed a weapon cable fairing, polar cap, and a one-foot by three-foot section of a warhead's ballistic case.|$|E

By now, the sport <b>had</b> <b>spread</b> throughout Australasia with Melbourne matches attracting the world's largest football crowds yet seen.|$|E
