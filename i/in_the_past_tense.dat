5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed {{the idea of the}} verb as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense,</b> however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E
5|$|Black {{speaks to}} fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) about his Butler vision. Watts informs Black that a Group member, Olson, has been tasked with {{monitoring}} Butler since her release. Watts and Black travel to Butler's {{last known address}} and find Olson's long-dead body. They realize Butler had been filing her own surveillance reports in Olson's name. Meanwhile, Bryce attempts to escape, but is subdued and later comforted by Lucy Butler. Black interviews Roe, suspecting her involvement when she continually refers to Bryce <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense.</b> He later discovers that in every school she has worked for, students have been kidnapped; all the victims resembled Bryce in being average students who showed signs of promise.|$|E

50|$|In {{dependent}} clauses (temporal, conditional, etc.), <b>the</b> time (<b>past,</b> present, or future) of an aorist subjunctive, optative, or imperative {{is based}} on the function of the mood. The subjunctive is used with main verbs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present and future tenses (primary sequence), and the optative is used with main verbs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> (secondary sequence) and to express potentiality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future.|$|R
25|$|Causative verbs {{were formed}} using ಚು, ಸು, ಇಚು, ಇಸು, ಪು, (ದು - obsolete, only present in very ancient forms). The first two and last were {{originally}} used only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tenses,</b> <b>the</b> middle two <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-past (i.e. present), and <b>the</b> penultimate one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. This reflects the Dravidian linguistic trait of causativity combined with time aspect. This trait was eventually lost.|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense</b> has two stems: beʕ- before consonant-initial suffixes (first {{and second}} person) and baʕ- {{elsewhere}} (third person).|$|R
25|$|Ablaut {{patterns}} are groups of vowels which are swapped, or ablauted, in {{the nucleus of}} a word. Strong verbs ablaut the lemma's nucleus to derive the past forms of the verb. This parallels English conjugation, where, e.g., the nucleus of sing becomes sang <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense</b> and sung in the past participle. Some verbs are derived by ablaut, as the present-in-past verbs do by consequence of being derived from the past tense forms of strong verbs.|$|E
25|$|On November 23, 1948, Mencken {{suffered}} a stroke, which left him aware and fully conscious but nearly unable {{to read or}} write and able to speak only with difficulty. After his stroke, Mencken enjoyed listening to Classical music and, after some recovery {{of his ability to}} speak, talking with friends, but he sometimes referred to himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense,</b> as if he were already dead.

25|$|Conservative Judaism {{is divided}} {{on the role of}} the Mussaf Amidah. More {{traditional}} Conservative congregations recite a prayer similar to the Mussaf prayer in Orthodox services, except they refer to Temple sacrifices only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense</b> and do not include a prayer for the restoration of the sacrifices. More liberal Conservative congregations omit references to the Temple sacrifices entirely. Reconstructionist and Reform congregations generally do not do the Mussaf Amidah at all, but if they do, they omit all references to Temple worship.|$|E

25|$|In {{one of his}} verses, Cnut's court poet Sigvatr Þórðarson recounts {{that famous}} princes brought their heads to Cnut and bought peace. This verse {{mentions}} Olaf Haraldsson <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense,</b> his death at the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030. It was therefore at some point after this and the consolidation of Norway that Cnut went to Scotland with an army, and the navy in the Irish Sea, in 1031, to receive, without bloodshed, the submission of three Scottish kings: Maelcolm, Maelbeth and Iehmarc. One of these kings, Iehmarc, may be one Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, an Uí Ímair chieftain and the ruler of a sea-kingdom of the Irish Sea, with Galloway among his domains.|$|E
25|$|This {{description}} is generally identified {{as part of}} the Priestly source ("P"), written in the sixth or fifth century BCE. However whilst the first Priestly source takes the form of instructions, the second is largely a repetition of the first <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense,</b> i.e., it describes the execution of the instructions. Many scholars contend that it is of a far later date than the time of Moses, and that the description reflects the structure of Solomon's Temple, while some hold that the description derives from memories of a real pre-monarchic shrine, perhaps the sanctuary at Shiloh. Traditional scholars contend that it describes an actual tabernacle used in the time of Moses and thereafter. According to historical criticism, an earlier, pre-exilic source, the Elohist ("E"), describes the Tabernacle as a simple tent-sanctuary.|$|E
500|$|Detectives {{noted that}} during her {{interview}} Green {{did not appear}} to be or have been crying, and her manner was [...] "talkative, even cheerful". She repeatedly referred to Tim and Kelly Farrar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense,</b> and referred to all of her children by their ages rather than their names. Her accounts of times from the previous evening varied, and she seemed uncertain what time she had done things like gone to bed.|$|E

500|$|During World War II, Citizen Kane was {{not seen}} in most European countries. It was shown in France {{for the first time}} on July 10, 1946 at the Marbeuf theatre in Paris. Initially [...] most French film critics were {{influenced}} by the negative reviews of Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945 and Georges Sadoul in 1946. At that time many French intellectuals and filmmakers shared Sartre's negative opinion that Hollywood filmmakers were uncultured. Sartre criticized the film's flashbacks for its nostalgic and romantic preoccupation with the past instead of the realities of the present and said that [...] "the whole film is based on a misconception of what cinema is all about.

500|$|The {{stone was}} {{originally}} {{raised by a}} wealthy lady named Ástríðr in memory of her husband Eysteinn, and Sawyer (2000) suggests it to {{have been one of}} several stones made in a tug-of-war over inheritance. There is uncertainty as to why Eysteinn went to Greece and Jerusalem, because of the interpretation of the word sœkja (attested as sotti <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense).</b> It means [...] "seek" [...] but it can mean [...] "attack" [...] as on the stones Sö 166 and N 184, but also [...] "visit" [...] or [...] "travel". Consequently, Eysteinn has been identified {{as one of the first}} Swedes to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but Jesch (2001) notes that judging from the other runic examples, the [...] "attack" [...] sense is more likely. The translation of sœkja as [...] "attack" [...] is also chosen by the Rundata project (see below). It is one of two Jarlabanke Runestones that mention travellers abroad, the other being U140, below.|$|E
500|$|While {{scholarly}} debate abounds as to {{the identities}} of the persons contemplated in the sonnet, there is general consensus as to Sonnet 86's role within the Rival Poet subsection of the Fair Youth sonnets. As Joseph Pequigney notes, [...] "Sonnet 86 is written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense,</b> as distinct from the present tense of the eight previous sonnets, to signal the end of the episode," [...] that is, the Rival Poet series of sonnets. As the final sonnet in the series, it is also the sonnet in which Shakespeare claims his ultimate victory over the rival poet, the situation [...] "resolved in Shakespeare's favor" [...] as he relentlessly mocks his opponent. Though he admits to having experienced a poetic hesitation, Shakespeare maintains that it was not the Rival Poet who caused it. Katherine Duncan-Jones writes: [...] "Undaunted by the splendour of his rival's verses, the speaker quails only at [...] appropriation of the young man's favour." ...|$|E
500|$|Morphemes can be {{classified}} according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called roots, or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or affixes can {{be classified}} according to their position {{in relation to the}} root: prefixes precede the root, suffixes follow the root, and infixes are inserted {{in the middle of a}} root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word [...] "run", which <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tense</b> is [...] "ran". This process is called ablaut. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of inflection, which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of derivation, which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb [...] "sing" [...] has the inflectional forms [...] "singing" [...] and [...] "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form [...] "singer", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix [...] "-er".|$|E
