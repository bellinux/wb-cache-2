500|$|Motley {{and fellow}} black {{teammate}} Bill Willis contended with racism throughout their careers. Although the color barrier was broken in all major American sports by 1950, the men endured shouted insults {{on the field}} and racial discrimination off of it. [...] "They found out that while they were calling us niggers and alligator bait, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> for touchdowns and Willis was knocking the shit out of them," [...] Motley once said. [...] "So they stopped calling us names and started trying to catch up with us." [...] Focused exclusively on winning, Brown did not tolerate racism within the team.|$|E

All of a sudden it just came out--a full first verse literally. It wasn’t like I said a line and worked out a few other lines, it literally just came out. I just spoke it and sang it and it scared me because that never happens". Powell said he then [...] "got up and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> around the house, throwing stuff everywhere looking for a pen and a piece of paper".|$|E

[...] He said he might have kicked or hit him had he been able to get close enough. Rose writes that Raghip also offered the order in which Blakelock's attackers had launched the assault. He was held for another two days, released on bail, then charged with murder six weeks later, in December 1985, under the doctrine of common purpose.|$|E

The son of two foreign-born doctors, he had spent a decade exploring dual identity before writing this play. In order to write this play, Akhtar decided to write from his own experiences.

500|$|In Nashville, Swift {{worked with}} {{experienced}} Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and The Warren Brothers. She eventually formed a lasting {{working relationship with}} Liz Rose. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose thought that the sessions were [...] "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write {{about what happened in}} school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks". Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left RCA Records when she was 14. She later recalled: [...] "I genuinely felt that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through".|$|E

When I would go to Stuart's, and we'd go up to his loft, it was like, 'Honey, I want to dance.' I wanted to be happy, silly and buoyant. I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record. So, yes, the new album was a {{reaction}} to all the other stuff I was doing, which was very serious in nature. I hope that doesn't imply that I wanted to make a superficial record, because it's not. I want people to smile when they hear this record. I wanted it to put a smile on my face, too.|$|E

500|$|Ringo Starr {{identified}} {{his initial}} inspiration for [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] as having come from Marc Bolan, the singer and guitarist with English glam rock band T. Rex. In a 2001 interview with Mojo editor Paul Du Noyer, Starr described Bolan as [...] "a dear friend {{who used to}} come into the office when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> Apple Movies, a big office in town, and the hang-out for myself, Harry Nilsson and Keith Moon". Over dinner one evening at Starr's home outside London, Bolan had used the word [...] "boogaloo" [...] so often that it stuck in Starr's mind, after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight. When discussing the composition on VH1 Storytellers in May 1998, Starr explained: [...] " [...] was an energised guy. He used to speak: 'Back off boogaloo... ooh you, boogaloo.' 'Do you want some potatoes?' 'Ooh you, boogaloo!'" [...] Starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children's toys that night, in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song.|$|E
500|$|In {{their second}} game, the Browns faced the Chicago Rockets at Soldier Field before {{a crowd of}} 51,962 people, an {{attendance}} record for a professional football game in Chicago. It {{was the first of}} many games during which Cleveland's two black players, Marion Motley and Bill Willis, endured racially charged verbal and physical abuse. Some of their white teammates, including Lou Rymkus, retaliated by dealing their own cheap shots. Motley opened the scoring with a 20-yard run for a touchdown, the first in his career. Lou Groza added two field goals in the third quarter, and halfback Don Greenwood ran for a 41-yard touchdown to make the final score 20–6. Chicago's only points came on a touchdown run by Billy Hillenbrand on the first play of the fourth quarter. Motley later said that racism on the field stopped after opponents saw how well he and Willis played: [...] "They found out that while they were calling us niggers and alligator bait, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> for touchdowns and Willis was knocking the shit out of them. So they stopped calling us names and started trying to catch up with us." ...|$|E
500|$|In the World Rally Championship, Mouton {{made her}} driver debut in 1974, {{finishing}} 12th in the Tour de Corse in an Alpine A110. It was rumoured her good performances {{were the result}} of a special engine, however her car passed inspection by WRC scrutineers. At the end of the year, Mouton was crowned both French and European ladies' champion. Re-entering the Tour de Corse the following season, she took seventh place. Mouton successfully defended her ladies' titles, and also competed in circuit racing: In an all-female team with Christine Dacremont and Marianne Hoepfner, she won the two-litre prototype category of the 1975 24 Hours of Le Mans. Recalling the race in 2008, Mouton said: [...] "It started to rain I remember, and I started to pass everybody. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> on slicks. In the pits they were saying 'Michele you must stop', but I did not want to because I was passing everyone." [...] Her results attracted a major sponsor {{in the form of the}} French oil company Elf. In 1976, Mouton drove the A110 to 11th place in Monte Carlo and retired at the Rallye Sanremo. At the Tour de Corse, her debut in the newer A310 also ended in retirement.|$|E

500|$|Promoted acting wing {{commander}} in June 1943, Arthur became wing leader of No.71 Wing, which controlled No.75 Squadron {{and three other}} combat units. On 5November, {{he was involved in}} a collision at Kiriwina Airfield with a Spitfire of No.79 Squadron. The Spitfire pilot was killed, and Arthur received serious burns. He later recalled, [...] "...I felt my hands disappear, felt my face go but the rest of my body was...was just flames...And {{then all of a sudden}} the flames dropped down a bit and I got out and went like mad and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> away from the aircraft and trying to guess how far I could go before I'd try to put the flames out..." [...] Although his family was informed that his injuries were [...] "of a very slight nature" [...] and that he had been [...] "burnt but not badly", Arthur was close to death for weeks while he was treated in Kiriwina. [...] He was finally repatriated to Sydney where he underwent plastic surgery at Yaralla Military Hospital (now Concord Hospital). After his recovery in April 1944, he attended a staff course before taking over command of No.2 Operational Training Unit at Mildura, Victoria. In August, at the age of 24, he was promoted to temporary group captain, the youngest in the RAAF. That December he took command of No.81 Wing of the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), based at Noemfoor and Labuan in the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} sessions for Achtung Baby, the Edge {{separated from his}} wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. Reflecting on the impact it had on U2, Bono said, [...] "We're a really tight community. This is not like somebody's, you know, girlfriend's left. We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard for us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'." [...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him {{for a kind of}} rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there." [...] Audio engineer Flood said the [...] "bold, unadulterated, naked [...] sound was a combination of the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mic. Edge just got an idea, tried it, and it worked straightaway." ...|$|E
