The range for blast effects increases with the explosive yield of the weapon and also depends on the burst altitude. Contrary to what one might expect from geometry, the blast range is not maximal for surface or low altitude blasts but increases with altitude up to an [...] "optimum burst altitude" [...] and then decreases rapidly for higher altitudes. This is due to the nonlinear behaviour of shock waves. When the blast wave from an air burst reaches the ground it is reflected. Below a certain reflection angle the reflected wave and the <b>direct</b> <b>wave</b> merge and form a reinforced horizontal wave, this is known as the 'Mach stem' (named after Ernst Mach) and is a form of constructive interference.|$|E

30|$|Both {{cross-correlation}} and deconvolution {{can be used}} {{to retrieve}} the Green’s function representations between different receiver locations in seismic interferometry. These two types of Green’s function representation have been verified as effective methods for vertical array to extract shear wave velocity in many previous studies (Miyazawa et al. 2008; Nakata and Snieder 2012 a; Takagi and Okada 2012). Moreover, Takagi and Okada (2012) reported that the cross-correlation of the coda waves is stable in time as the deconvolution of <b>direct</b> <b>waves</b> used by Nakata and Snieder (2012 a). In this study, we preferred deconvolution-based interferometry because it can eliminate the effect of the incident wavefields to get a more reasonable estimation of shear wave velocity (Nakata and Snieder 2012 a). We also compared the results from coda waves and those from <b>direct</b> <b>waves</b> for three stations (i.e., IBRH 11, IBRH 13 and TCGH 17) using deconvolution-based interferometry as shown in Additional file 2 : Fig. S 2. It can be found that the results from coda waves are similar to those from <b>direct</b> <b>waves,</b> because deconvolution interferometry can eliminate the effects of the incident wavefields for vertical arrays as we mentioned above.|$|R

Three systems are examined: <b>directed</b> <b>waves</b> in random media, the 2 D ±J Ising spin glass, and tree-like neural networks. Unitary propagation of <b>directed</b> <b>waves</b> is described by a chr 6 dinger equation with a random time-dependent potential. We propose a random S-matrix model for di-rected waves, based on the path integral solution to this Schr 6 dinger equation. Exact computations are performed by summing over directed paths on the square lattice. We report asymptotic scaling laws for <b>directed</b> <b>waves</b> and interpret them in light of similar results for random walks.

We present an exact integer algorithm to compute the partition function of this system, based on the diagrammatic expansion of the high-temperature series. We examine the low-temperature behavior, the roots of the partition function in the complex plane, and the scaling laws for defects. Boltzmann machines are neural networks based on Ising spin systems. We use exact techniques from statistical mechanics to derive an efficient learning algorithm for tree-like Boltzmann machines.

40|$|Propagation of <b>direct</b> <b>waves</b> and {{dispersive}} long-period waves along a layered {{system was}} investigated experimentally {{by means of}} two-dimensional ultrasonic models. Velocities of <b>direct</b> and head <b>waves</b> were measured within layers or in a medium adjacent to layers as func-tions of layer thickness to wave length or source-from-interface distance to wave length. Amplitudes of direct longitudinal, direct shear, and long-period waves were measured on three profiles, each perpendicular to the layers. Three models were used: the first consisted of a low-velocity layer between two thick sheets; the second of a high-velocity layer between two sheets; the third of six alternating high- and low-velocity layers between two sheets. The source was a wave train, simulating a wave from a seismic explosion. The frequency was varied so as to obtain different ratios of layer thickness to wave length. In the single low-velocity layer model the <b>direct</b> longitudinal <b>wave</b> contained a larger amplitude than the dispersive long-period wave in the layer at offset distance of 6 to 10 times the layer thickness. In the single high-velocity layer model the <b>direct</b> longitudinal <b>wave</b> was attenuated rapidly and the ampli-tudes of the long-period waves were negligible. In the multilayered model, <b>direct</b> <b>waves</b> had negligible amplitudes at the corresponding distances; {{nearly all of the}} energy was in the dis-persive long-period waves. In this model the low-velocity layer carried 1 to 3 times the ampli-tude observed in the high-velocity layers, whether the source was located in the high- or low-velocity layers. Dispersion of the long-period waves in the multilayered model was pronounced within the low-velocity layers and weak in the high-velocity layers, when the source was either in a high- or low-velocity layer. Dispersion was anomalous when the source was in a low-velocity layer and normal when in a high-velocity layer...|$|R

Numerical simulations of elastic waves are performed in a 2 D scattering plate with a focus on the comparative character of the <b>direct</b> and coda <b>waves</b> in the cross-correlation.

The long term average of random ultrasound waves can reconstruct the impulse response between two points on an aluminum block. However, they had assumed random diffuse noise, limiting interferometry in real world conditions. In a similar case, it was shown that the expressions for uncorrelated noise sources reduce to a single crosscorrelation of observations at two receivers. The interferometric impulse response of the subsurface can be reconstructed using only an extended record of background noise, initially only for the surface and <b>direct</b> <b>wave</b> arrivals.|$|E
50|$|Seismic {{interferometry}} {{applications are}} currently limited {{by a number}} of factors. Real world media and noise represent limitations for current theoretical development. For example, for interferometry to work noise sources must be uncorrelated and completely surround the region of interest. In addition, attenuation and geometrical spreading are largely neglected and need to be incorporated into more robust models. Other challenges are inherent to seismic interferometry. For example, the source term only drops out {{in the case of the}} crosscorrelation of a <b>direct</b> <b>wave</b> at a location A with a ghost reflection at a location B. The correlation of other waveforms can introduce multiples to the resulting interferogram. Velocity analysis and filtering can reduce but not eliminate the occurrence of multiples in a given dataset.|$|E

Thus, in addition to seismic potency, wave reflections at the Conrad discontinuity may contribute to the formation of the lower boundaries of anomalies 1 and 2.|$|R
