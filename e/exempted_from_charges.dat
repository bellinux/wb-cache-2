25|$|According to A.B. Atkinson, social {{security}} received much more {{attention from the}} first Wilson government than it did during the previous thirteen years of Conservative government. Following its victory in the 1964 general election, Wilson's government began to increase social benefits. Prescription charges for medicines were abolished immediately, while pensions were raised to a record 21% of average male industrial wages. In 1966, the system of National Assistance (a social assistance scheme for the poor) was overhauled and renamed Supplementary Benefit. The means test was replaced with a statement of income, and benefit rates for pensioners (the great majority of claimants) were increased, granting them a real gain in income. Before the 1966 election, the widow's pension was tripled. Due to austerity measures following an economic crisis, prescription charges were re-introduced in 1968 {{as an alternative to}} cutting the hospital building programme, although those sections of the population who were most in need (including supplementary benefit claimants, the long-term sick, children, and pensioners) were <b>exempted</b> <b>from</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 39 ANAP deputies in the {{parliament}} submitted a motion to investigate the corruption case. On May 15, 1985, 311 of the total 400 deputies of {{the parliament}} {{voted in favor of}} a proposal to send Özdağlar before the Constitutional Court (Yüce Divan) for trial. The trial began on May 21, 1985. İsmail Özdağlar stood trial along with his father Ali Özdağlar and his brother-in-law Mehmet Kaymak, who were actively involved in the corruption. Even Özal testified in the court against Özdağlar. The supreme court concluded on February 14, 1986 that İsmail Özdağlar is guilty of malpractice, and sentenced him to two years in prison, a fine of 30,000 Turkish lira, a two-year ban from employment in state service and in addition the payment of trial expenses amounting to 281,410 Turkish lira. He was <b>exempted</b> <b>from</b> <b>charges</b> for bribery.|$|E

5000|$|There {{was also}} much {{controversy}} over the government's decision to reintroduce Prescription charges in 1968 (after having abolished them in 1964), although the blow of this measure was arguably by softened {{by the fact that}} many people were <b>exempted</b> <b>from</b> <b>charges.</b> In 1968, arguably in response to sensationalist stories about supposed [...] "scroungers" [...] and [...] "welfare cheats", the government made the decision to introduce a controversial new rule terminating benefits for single men under the age of 45. Under this rule, young, single, unskilled men who lived in areas of low unemployment would have their supplementary benefits stopped after four weeks. Wilson’s government also failed to maintain the real value of family allowances during its time in office, which (despite being doubled under Wilson) fell by 13% in real terms between 1964 and 1969. In addition, tax allowances were reduced in 1968 to pay in part for increases in family allowances, and despite inflation were not increased again until 1971. Family allowances were increased for the fourth and subsequent children from 50p to 75p per week in October 1966, and then in April 1967 to 75p for the second child and 85p for each subsequent child. According to one writer, however, this policy did not help single mothers with only one child, Supplementary Benefit payments were reduced [...] "by the amount of this increase," [...] and tax allowances were adjusted [...] "to recover the cost of family allowances from taxpayers, including some low earners." ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{socioeconomic}} {{differences in}} mortality (by cause of death) among diabetic people {{with those in}} the rest of the population. DESIGN: Five year follow up of mortality in the population of Finland, comparing people with diabetes and those without diabetes. SETTING: Finland. SUBJECTS: All residents of Finland aged 30 to 74 included in the 1980 census. Subjects were classified as diabetic (230, 000 person years) or other (12, 400, 000 person years) according to whether they were <b>exempted</b> <b>from</b> <b>charges</b> for medication for diabetes. During 1981 - 5 there were 114, 058 deaths, of which 11, 215 were in people with diabetes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age standardised mortality by sex, social class, and cause of death for the diabetic and non-diabetic populations. RESULTS: No significant social class differences in mortality were found among women with diabetes. Among diabetic men there was a slight increasing trend in mortality from the upper while collar group to the unskilled blue collar workers but it was much less steep than that of non-diabetic men. CONCLUSIONS: Among people with diabetes in Finland the quality of treatment and compliance with treatment probably do not vary by socioeconomic status. Health education for diabetic people seems to be effective in all socioeconomic strata; in people from the lower strata this leads to greater changes because their health behavior was originally less good...|$|E

50|$|Although {{previously}} toll free, Halton Borough Council {{has stated}} that the Silver Jubilee bridge will require a toll like the Mersey Gateway bridge on completion of the scheme. This will make Halton the only borough in England separated by only toll bridges. However, most Halton residents will be <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>charges</b> if they pay an annual subscription to register their vehicles. The Silver Jubilee bridge is to be reduced to one lane in each direction for vehicles with the remaining carriageways converted to pedestrian/cycleways. Protests have been staged opposing the decision to implement tolls on both crossings. Campaigners say the extra transport costs will have a detrimental effect on the area and its economy.|$|R
