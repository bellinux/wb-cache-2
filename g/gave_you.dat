25|$|It <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> {{some sense}} of {{perspective}} of past, present and future. It took the myopic conflict between just black and white in the United States {{and put it on}} another level because you saw the turmoil between the Armenians and the Turks, and the Cypriots and the Greeks, and the Swedes and the Danes, and the Koreans and the Japanese. Everybody had these hassles, and you saw it was a basic part of human nature, these conflicts. It opened my soul, it opened my mind.|$|E
25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E

[...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that the lyric [...] "God <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> style and <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> grace," [...] Martin sings as if [...] "cataloguing the attributes he only wishes he had". When the song is performed live, guitarist Jonny Buckland begins a long ripping off guitar riff while Chris Martin plays an acoustic guitar.|$|E

In The Sunday Times in February 1969, Paul Jennings wrote of him: [...] "If I ever knew a gentleman, it was Kenneth Horne.... He <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> his whole attention, his whole courtesy.

500|$|Universal {{initially}} projected a $600,000 budget, {{but added}} an additional $175,000 once producer Francis Ford Coppola signed on. This {{would allow the}} studio to advertise American Graffiti as [...] "from the Man who <b>Gave</b> <b>you</b> The Godfather (1972)". However, Lucas was forced to concede final cut privilege. The proposition also gave Universal first look deals on Lucas's next two planned projects, Star Wars (1977) and Radioland Murders (1994). As he continued {{to work on the}} script, Lucas encountered difficulties on the Steve and Laurie storyline. Lucas, Katz and Huyck worked on the third draft together, specifically on the scenes featuring Steve and Laurie.|$|E

Among those invited was the loyalist commander of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces, Colonel Lê Quang Tung. At 13:30 (UTC 06:30), General Trần Văn Đôn announced that a coup was taking place. Most of the officers rose to applaud, but Tung did not, refusing to join the coup.

500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged. Bassist Peter Mosely, in discussion of this, said: [...] "We're older than people think we are. [...] We go through months of serenity, and then there'll be this one night where there will be evil." [...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. You find yourself surrounded by a lot of false people, {{a lot of people who}} are not doing it for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new but stay in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / Even when you know what they've done / They <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> the end but not where to start / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> the end / But not where to start / Not how to build / But how to tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E
500|$|One {{poster for}} the film {{included}} the statement: [...] "Rick Baker, the new master of special effects, who brought you the magic of The Exorcist and <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> the wonder of King Kong, now brings you his greatest creation, The Incredible Melting Man". Although Baker assisted with the effects in The Exorcist (1973), Dick Smith was the makeup artist who primarily worked on that film, not Baker. Exorcist director William Friedkin was so angry about the poster that, upon seeing it on an associate's wall, he tore it down and ripped it to pieces. Baker, {{who did not know}} about the poster in advance, was horrified by the publicity campaign and publicly apologized for it, claiming: [...] "Dick wanted some help so I first went out to do some work on the dummy whose head turns around 360 degrees. I really didn't do anything creative, I just did labor".|$|E

(...) The opening song [...] "The Message" [...] features production by the Trackmasters, Poke & Tone, and scratching from Kid Capri. One critic described the song as a [...] "bloody narrative", and cited it as [...] "one of the most visually evocative songs of Nas' career". The song's title references the classic hip hop single [...] "The Message" [...] (1982) by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. Legendary producer DJ Premier had one production credit on the jazz fusion-styled [...] "I <b>Gave</b> <b>You</b> Power", a song which depicts a first-person narrative {{from the perspective of}} a gun. The song is accompanied by falling piano notes and stuttering drums.|$|E
500|$|Episode writer Lender {{proposed}} to have Count Orlok of the 1922 silent film Nosferatu {{appear as a}} gag {{at the end of}} the episode. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg accepted Lender's proposal and allowed him to do it. Lender said, [...] "Steve <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> the opportunities to do things that would really be memorable, if you could sell him on it." [...] Lender then searched for books with scannable pictures of Count Orlok. However, the image of Count Orlok used in the episode was taken from the Internet. He said, [...] "I searched what little there was of the Web back then." [...] Nick Jennings Photoshopped the smile on Count Orlok to make sure it matched Lender's board drawing. Lender said, [...] "It was my baby, and I held its hand until we shipped it overseas [...]" [...] Before his idea of Count Orlok, Lender thought of [...] "Floorboard Harry", a deleted gag that concludes the broadcast episode, in which he initially flickers the lights.|$|E
500|$|Although {{both were}} {{committed}} O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to {{conflict between the}} two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen to her face that he preferred Northrup sexually: [...] "This {{is a fact that}} I can do nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally – we get on well. Your character is superior. You are a greater person. I doubt that she would face what you have with me – or support me as well." [...] Some years later, addressing himself as [...] "You", Parsons told himself that his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick: [...] "Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> the magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically {{the track}} is written about a failing {{relationship}} {{caused by a}} partner who abuses alcohol. The singer speaks {{of a man who}} faces a disconnect between his personality while drunk and sober, causing the inability to forge a connection. During the second verse Gomez sings [...] "Why is it so different when we wake up? / Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch / Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough / But I know what's next, and I want so much", describing a lover who can only show his true emotions while intoxicated. Later in the song she expresses the pain she feels having wasted so much time into her relationship, and decides to leave her dysfunctional lover: [...] "You've got a hold on me / You're like a wasted dream / I <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> everything / But you don't know how to love me when you're sober".|$|E
500|$|Gore {{himself would}} later {{poke fun at}} the controversy. In 2000, while on the Late Show with David Letterman he read Letterman's Top 10 List (which for this show was called, [...] "Top Ten Rejected Gore – Lieberman Campaign Slogans") to the audience. Number nine on the list was: [...] "Remember, America, I <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> the Internet, and I can take it away!" [...] In 2005 when Gore was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award [...] "for three decades of {{contributions}} to the Internet" [...] at the Webby Awards he joked in his acceptance speech (limited to five words according to Webby Awards rules): [...] "Please don't recount this vote." [...] He was introduced by Vint Cerf who used the same format to joke: [...] "We all invented the Internet." [...] Gore, who was then asked to add a few more words to his speech, stated: [...] "It is time to reinvent the Internet {{for all of us}} to make it more robust and much more accessible and use it to reinvigorate our democracy." ...|$|E

Her Majesty the Queen, my dear cousin, is British born." [...] Similarly, Marie wrote that {{the day of her}} arrival in England was [...] "a great day for me, one of emotions, sweet, happy and the same time glorious emotions to come back as Queen to my own country, to be received officially, in all honour and enthusiastically into the bargain – to feel your heart swell with pride and satisfaction, to feel your heart beat and tears start into your eyes, while something <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> a lump into your throat!"
