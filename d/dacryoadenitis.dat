50|$|<b>Dacryoadenitis</b> is {{inflammation}} of the lacrimal glands (the tear-producing glands).|$|E
50|$|Chronic <b>dacryoadenitis</b> {{is usually}} due to noninfectious {{inflammatory}} disorders. Examples include sarcoidosis, thyroid eye disease, and orbital pseudotumor.|$|E
50|$|Acute <b>dacryoadenitis</b> is most {{commonly}} due to viral or bacterial infection. Common causes include mumps, Epstein-Barr virus, staphylococcus, and gonococcus.|$|E
50|$|Most {{patients}} will fully recover from <b>dacryoadenitis.</b> For conditions with more serious causes, such as sarcoidosis, the prognosis {{is that of}} the underlying condition.|$|E
50|$|Swelling may {{be severe}} enough to put {{pressure}} on the eye and distort vision. Some patients first thought to have <b>dacryoadenitis</b> may turn out to have a malignancy of the lacrimal gland.|$|E
50|$|If {{the cause}} of <b>dacryoadenitis</b> is a viral {{condition}} such as mumps, simple rest and warm compresses may be all that is needed. For other causes, the treatment is specific to the causative disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dacryoadenitis</b> can be {{diagnosed}} by {{examination of the}} eyes and lids. Special tests such as a CT scan {{may be required to}} search for the cause. Sometimes biopsy will be needed to be sure that a tumor of the lacrimal gland is not present.|$|E
50|$|The {{lacrimal}} glands are paired, almond-shaped exocrine glands, one {{for each}} eye, that secrete the aqueous layer of the tear film. They are situated in the upper lateral region of each orbit, in the lacrimal fossa of the orbit formed by the frontal bone. Inflammation of the lacrimal glands is called <b>dacryoadenitis.</b> The lacrimal gland produces tears which then flow into canals that connect to the lacrimal sac. From that sac, the tears drain through the lacrimal duct into the nose.|$|E
5000|$|The best imaging {{modality}} for idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease is contrast-enhanced thin section magnetic resonance with fat suppression. The best diagnostic clue is a poorly marginated, mass-like enhancing soft tissue involving any {{area of the}} orbit. Overall, radiographic features for idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome vary widely. They include inflammation of the extraocular muscles (myositis) with tendinous involvement, orbital fat stranding, lacrimal gland inflammation and enlargement (<b>dacryoadenitis),</b> involvement of the optic sheath complex, uvea, and sclera, a focal intraorbital mass or even diffuse orbital involvement. Bone destruction and intracranial extension is rare, but has been reported. Depending on the area of involvement, IOI may be categorized as: ...|$|E
40|$|Acute <b>dacryoadenitis</b> is an {{uncommon}} condition that involves {{inflammation of the}} lacrimal gland. In rare instances, <b>dacryoadenitis</b> may be bilateral.

40|$|PURPOSE. MRL/MpJ mice of substrains MRL/MpJ-fas � /fas � (MRL/�) and MRL/MpJ-fas lpr /fas lpr (MRL/lpr) spontaneously develop {{autoimmune}} <b>dacryoadenitis</b> and sialadenitis {{and are a}} {{model for}} the human disorder Sjögren syndrome. The <b>dacryoadenitis</b> in both substrains appears to be Th 2 in nature, with little IFN- � and substantial IL- 4 at the site of lacrimal gland inflammation. METHODS. MRL/MpJ mice with a defective IL- 4 gene—both MRL/�-IL- 4 tm /IL- 4 tm (MRL/�/IL- 4 tm) and MRL/lpr-IL- 4 tm /IL- 4 tm (MRL/lpr-IL- 4 tm) —that resulted in a loss of IL- 4 production were bred and evaluated for <b>dacryoadenitis.</b> RESULTS.

40|$|The NOD mouse {{develops}} spontaneous autoimmune lesions in the lacrimal and salivary glands, {{besides a}} well characterized T cell-mediated autoimmune pancreatic β cell lesion. We report unique pathological findings {{developed in the}} lacrimal glands as an autoimmune <b>dacryoadenitis</b> of NOD mice in contrast {{to those found in}} the salivary glands and pancreas. A high incidence of autoimmune lesions in the lacrimal glands was observed exclusively in male NOD mice at any age. Histology of autoimmune <b>dacryoadenitis</b> in male NOD mice showed severe destructive changes compared with those observed previously as an autoimmune lesion in the lacrimal glands. Castration in male NOD mice significantly decreased the incidence of autoimmune <b>dacryoadenitis,</b> and testosterone treatment with castration also increased the incidence of autoimmune lesions. Oestrogen treatment with castration did not increase the incidence, but tamoxifen treatment without castration significantly increased the incidence of autoimmune <b>dacryoadenitis</b> in NOD mice. In addition, we detected up-regulation of local cytokine genes (IL- 1 β, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL- 2, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), IL- 6, IL- 10, and IL- 12 p 40) during the course of autoimmune <b>dacryoadenitis.</b> These data suggest that in spontaneous autoimmune <b>dacryoadenitis</b> of male NOD mice there may be an intimate relationship with sex steroids, particularly testosterone, in the development and progression of autoimmune lesions, and autoreactive Th 1 cells secrete up-regulated cytokine genes, including IL- 10 and IL- 12...|$|E

40|$|Purpose—MRL/MpJ mice of substrains MRL/MpJ-fas+/fas+ (MRL/+) and MRL/MpJ-faslpr/ faslpr (MRL/lpr) spontaneously develop {{autoimmune}} <b>dacryoadenitis</b> and sialadenitis {{and are a}} {{model for}} the human disorder Sjögren syndrome. The <b>dacryoadenitis</b> in both substrains appears to be Th 2 in nature, with little IFN-γ and substantial IL- 4 at the site of lacrimal gland inflammation. Methods—MRL/MpJ mice with a defective IL- 4 gene—both MRL/+-IL- 4 tm/IL- 4 tm (MRL/+/ IL- 4 tm) and MRL/lpr-IL- 4 tm/IL- 4 tm (MRL/lpr-IL- 4 tm) —that resulted in a loss of IL- 4 production were bred and evaluated for <b>dacryoadenitis.</b> Results—MRL/+/IL- 4 tm and MRL/lpr/IL- 4 tm mice developed <b>dacryoadenitis</b> of similar onset, appearance, and severity as found in MRL/MpJ mice with an intact IL- 4 gene. Immunohistochemistry examination revealed a substantially greater number of inflammatory cells staining for IFN-γ than for IL- 13 in the <b>dacryoadenitis</b> of IL- 4 – deficient MRL/MpJ mice (MRL/+/IL- 4 tm, 66 % vs. 0. 8 %, P = 0. 001; MRL/lpr/IL- 4 tm, 67 % vs. 1. 2 %, P = 0. 002).

40|$|Acute <b>dacryoadenitis</b> is an {{uncommon}} disease. Case: We present {{what we believe}} to be the first reported case of herpes zoster ophthalmicus with the onset of acute <b>dacryoadenitis.</b> Observations: A 30 -year-old man complained of severe ocular pain and hyperemia in his right eye. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated enlargement of the right lacri-mal gland and acute <b>dacryoadenitis</b> was diagnosed. Two days after treatment with systemic antibiotics he developed iridocyclitis and skin lesions confined to the first division of the trigeminal nerve; therefore, herpes zoster ophthalmicus was diagnosed. Treatment with acy-clovir immediately resolved the ocular pain and swelling of the upper eyelid.

40|$|Introduction Almost all organs can be {{involved}} in the infection by Epstein–Barr virus and consequently, the beginning symptoms of infectious mononucleosis may be different. Materials and methods We report a case of infection by Epstein–Barr virus in a 17 -year-old girl whose primary manifestation was an initially monolateral and subsequently bilateral <b>dacryoadenitis.</b> Results The incidence of acute <b>dacryoadenitis</b> by Epstein–Barr virus is valued around one case per million people per year, but it is probably underestimated: it is due to infiltration of the lacrimal gland by activated lymphocytes. Discussion An acute <b>dacryoadenitis,</b> especially when it affects a young adult and when bilateral, should guide the diagnostic and haematochemical and serological investigations towards a systemic disease such as infectious mononucleosis. It is almost always responsive to a systemic corticosteroid therapy, but in some cases it can progress towards a dacryocystitis and exceptionally towards the Sjögren syndrome. Appropriate and timely treatment will be able to reduce any subsequent complications. </p...|$|E

40|$|Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, {{also known}} as Kuttner tumor, is a chronic {{inflammatory}} disease of the salivary glands that is reported {{in a few cases}} in medical literature. Recent reports suggest that certain aspects of sclerosing diseases, including chronic sclerosing sialadenitis or <b>dacryoadenitis,</b> should be classified under immunoglobulin G 4 (IgG 4) -related sclerosing disease based on immunohistochemical studies. This study reports an unusual case of IgG 4 -related sclerosing disease appearing simultaneously in the lacrimal glands, submandibular glands, and extraocular muscles. A 56 -year-old male presented with complaints of bilateral eyelid swelling and proptosis that began two years ago.

40|$|AbstractA 47 -year-old man had recurrent, episodic {{swelling}} of the right upper eyelid for about 2 years. There was a progressively enlarging, palpable mass over the superotemporal region of the right orbit without tenderness, local heat, or erythema. Ophthalmic examination revealed proptosis and ptosis of the right eye without vision decrease or ocular motility disturbance. An orbital computed tomography scan showed a huge lacrimal gland causing inferior displacement of the globe with proptosis. An anterior orbitotomy was done, and the pathological analysis revealed marked lymphoplasma cell infiltration with mild to moderate fibrosis surrounding the lobules of the lacrimal glands. No lymphoepithelial islands were seen. Immunohistochemically, about 40 – 50 % of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) -positive cells were IgG 4 positive, and the ratio of serum IgG 4 to total IgG was 80. 9 %, compatible with a diagnosis of IgG 4 -related chronic sclerosing <b>dacryoadenitis.</b> IgG 4 -related chronic sclerosing <b>dacryoadenitis</b> {{may be a sign}} of Mikulicz disease, an IgG 4 -related systemic disease.

40|$|Similar to {{pancreatic}} islets, submandibular glands {{are more}} rapidly infiltrated in female NOD mice than in males. The present comparative analysis of cellular infiltrations in lacrimal glands, however, revealed the opposite finding. At 12 wk of age, approximately 25 % of male lacrimal tissue area is infiltrated, whereas age-matched female NOD mice still lack major signs of inflammation. T cells predominate in {{early stages of}} invasion, but B cells accumulate promptly in more advanced stages, and ultimately dominate over T cells. <b>Dacryoadenitis</b> is promoted by sex hormones, {{as suggested by the}} reduced infiltrations seen in orchidectomized NOD males (P < 0. 01). It is also controlled by the local environment provided by the lacrimal tissue. Splenocytes from 4 - and 20 -wk-old female NOD mice cause massive lesions upon adoptive transfer into NOD male recipients while, conversely, female recipients develop barely any histological sign of infiltration, even after transfer of splenocytes from 20 -wk-old donor males. These observations provide strong evidence for a dacryoadenitis-promoting role of male gonadal hormones in NOD mice, a finding that contrasts the known androgen-mediated protective effects on insulitis and submandibulitis in the same strain and on <b>dacryoadenitis</b> in other animal models of Sjögren's syndrome...|$|E
