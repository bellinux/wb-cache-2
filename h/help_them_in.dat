5|$|The Brander–Spencer {{model is}} an {{economic}} model in international trade originally developed by James Brander and Barbara Spencer in the early 1980s.

This conclusion stands in contrast to results from most international trade models, in which government non-interference is socially optimal.|$|E

5|$|Noether {{was brought}} to Göttingen in 1915 by David Hilbert and Felix Klein, who wanted her {{expertise}} in invariant theory to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> understanding general relativity, a geometrical theory of gravitation developed mainly by Albert Einstein. Hilbert had observed that the conservation of energy seemed to be violated in general relativity, because gravitational energy could itself gravitate. Noether provided the resolution of this paradox, and a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics, with Noether's first theorem, which she proved in 1915, but did not publish until 1918. She not only solved the problem for general relativity, but also determined the conserved quantities for every system of physical laws that possesses some continuous symmetry.|$|E

5|$|Taoism was the {{official}} {{religion of the}} Tang. Buddhism, originating in India {{around the time of}} Confucius, continued its influence during the Tang period and was accepted by some members of imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of Chinese traditional culture. In an age before Neo-Confucianism and figures such as Zhu Xi (1130–1200), Buddhism had begun to flourish in China during the Northern and Southern dynasties, and became the dominant ideology during the prosperous Tang. Buddhist monasteries played an integral role in Chinese society, offering lodging for travelers in remote areas, schools for children throughout the country, and a place for urban literati to stage social events and gatherings such as going-away parties. Buddhist monasteries were also engaged in the economy, since their land property and serfs gave them enough revenues to set up mills, oil presses, and other enterprises. Although the monasteries retained 'serfs', these monastery dependents could actually own property and employ others to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> their work, including their own slaves.|$|E
