5|$|Miles {{turns up}} in Summer Bay {{and decides to}} stick around after he thinks it is a {{familiar}} setting. He has nowhere to live and is starving. Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) becomes annoyed with him for stealing food out of the bins, but Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) takes pity on him and feeds him. He sees Sally {{on the beach and}} writes Milco in the sand. They later become friends and she feels like she has a close connection. He reveals his family's death to be the reason why he became a drifter. He eventually reveals the truth to Sally, that he is Milco and her twin brother. After it sinks in she is delighted with this and they become close. Miles stays with her and one night forgets to lock the door. Johnny Cooper (Callan Mulvey) enters the house and stabs Sally, however she survives but he blames himself. He decides to get his life back on track and becomes an English teacher at the school. Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance) initially gives him a hard time, but he is well liked after he and Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) arrange a leaving party for Sally, who has decided to move away. At the party Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson) are startled to meet the person they <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> much about whilst growing up.|$|E
25|$|For UK foster parents, {{the trauma}} of losing the {{children}} they had looked after and grown to love could be just as bad. Some children and families kept contact and many held fond memories and grateful thanks {{for the people of}} the north who showed so much kindness. The Mayor of Bolton had threatened the islands with another invasion after liberation, as so many Lancashire holidaymakers would want to see the islands they had <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> much about.|$|E
25|$|On 2 November, {{prosecutors}} {{charged the}} club's owners—Alin Anastasescu, Paul Gancea, and Costin Mincu—with negligent homicide and negligent bodily harm, and detained them after a 10-hour hearing. As of 5 November, 70 {{people have been}} <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> far in the Colectiv fire case. Many came on their own initiative to file a complaint and be a civil party. The former mayor of Sector 4, Cristian Popescu Piedone, is also being targeted in the case, being investigated for abuse of office and forgery concerning the authorization of Club Colectiv. On 6 November, he was detained by DNA prosecutors for 24 hours.|$|E

25|$|The first answer {{must occur}} as {{soon after the}} initial {{statement}} of the subject as possible; therefore the first codetta is often extremely short, or not needed. In the above example this is the case: the subject finishes on the quarter note (or crotchet) B-flat of the third beat of the second bar which harmonizes the opening G of the answer. The later codettas may be considerably longer, and often serve to (a) develop the material <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> far in the subject/answer and countersubject and possibly introduce ideas heard in the second countersubject or free counterpoint that follows (b) delay, and therefore heighten {{the impact of the}} reentry of the subject in another voice as well as modulating back to the tonic.|$|E
500|$|When Debs was {{released}} from the Atlanta Penitentiary, the other prisoners sent him off with [...] "a roar of cheers" [...] and a crowd of 50,000 greeted his return to Terre Haute to the accompaniment of band music. En route home, Debs was warmly received at the White House by Harding, who greeted him by saying: [...] "Well, I've <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> damned much about you, Mr. Debs, that I am now glad to meet you personally." ...|$|E
500|$|Silent Civilian {{released}} {{their debut}} album Rebirth of the Temple on May 2, 2006. Blabbermouth.net reviewer, Scott Alisoglu, thought [...] "on virtually every track, the group meshes attacking riffs, searing solos, brutal drumming, and melody-drenched bombast". Although {{he did not}} believe it was a 'grand slam', {{he thought it was a}} [...] "pleasant surprise and strong first effort". Charlie Steffens of KNAC described the album as [...] "goddamn electric", while Greg Maki of live-metal.net awarded the album a perfect 10 out of 10 selecting it as his [...] "best album I have <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> far in 2006." [...] As of June 5, 2007, Rebirth of the Temple has sold 25,000 copies.|$|E

500|$|Before Rimsky-Korsakov {{went to the}} Conservatory, in March 1868, Tchaikovsky wrote {{a review}} of his Fantasia on Serbian Themes. In {{discussing}} this work, Tchaikovsky compared it to the only other Rimsky-Korsakov piece he had <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> far, the First Symphony, mentioning [...] "its charming orchestration ... its structural novelty, {{and most of all}} ... the freshness of its purely Russian harmonic turns ... immediately [...] Mr. Rimsky-Korsakov to be a remarkable symphonic talent". Tchaikovsky's notice, worded in precisely a way to find favor within the Balakirev circle, did exactly that. He met the rest of The Five on a visit to Balakirev's house in Saint Petersburg the following month. The meeting went well. Rimsky-Korsakov later wrote, ...|$|E
500|$|Coming off an 8–4 season during which, {{according}} to USA Today's Paul Myerberg, [...] "Attrition robbed Penn State of {{everything but the}} kitchen sink, or so we <b>heard,</b> <b>so</b> it was quite surprising when the sink, a few walk-ons, a mathematician, a local kid and a rookie coach went 8-2 after a sluggish start, pushing back against storm clouds and bringing PSU back from the abyss of life post-NCAA sanctions." [...] Many college football analysts expected the Nittany Lions to perform similarly in 2013, although almost all season outlooks noted that the team could take a major step back from 2012 if they were hampered by injuries, or could surprise everyone and win more games {{than they did in}} 2012.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of his death Beiderbecke was little known except among fellow musicians, and for several years critics paid little {{attention}} to his music. As Jean Pierre Lion has pointed out, [...] "The only serious and analytical obituary to have been published in the months" [...] after his death was by a Frenchman, Hugues Panassié. The notice appeared in October 1931 and began with a bit of hyperbole and an incorrect fact, two hallmarks of much of the subsequent writing about Beiderbecke: [...] "The announcement of Bix Beiderbecke's death plunged all jazz musicians into despair. We first believed it was a false alarm, as we had <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> often before about Bix. Unfortunately, precise information has been forthcoming, and we even know the day—August 7—when he passed away." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 22, {{after the}} work of the Commission had ended, Khrushchev invited the delegates to a dinner which, {{according}} to Alia, was used [...] "to threaten those parties which might oppose the line of the Soviets in November." [...] He gave as an example an exchange between Soviet Politburo member Yekaterina Furtseva and Kapo, in which the former asked, [...] "Are you Hysni Kapo?! I've <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> much about you..." [...] Kapo replied, [...] "For good or bad?" [...] to which Furtseva stated, [...] "You have attacked the Soviet Union, but you are heading for trouble on that course," [...] getting [...] "the reply she deserved" [...] from Kapo, with Alia further writing that [...] "her mission was just to transmit the signal. Throughout the whole dinner she did not speak to us again." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrell's four voyages {{finally ended}} on [...] 1831, with {{his return to}} New York. He then wrote his Narrative of Four Voyages, which was {{published}} the following year. He attempted to resume his seafaring career, seeking employment with the London-based shipping firm of Enderby Brothers, but his reputation had preceded {{him and he was}} rejected. Charles Enderby stated publicly that [...] "he had <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> much of him that he did not think fit to enter into any engagement with him." [...] Morrell also sought to join Dumont D'Urville's expedition to the Weddell Sea in 1837, but his services were again declined. He reportedly died in 1839, [...] and is commemorated by Morrell Island, 59°27'S, 27°19'W, [...] an alternative name for Thule Island in the Southern Thule sub-group of the South Sandwich Islands. Robert Johnson, who coined the name New South Greenland, disappeared with his ship in 1826, while investigating the Antarctic waters in the vicinity [...] of what would later be known as the Ross Sea.|$|E
500|$|... "Man, {{there will}} be a time for Down. Matter of fact we had a meeting this past week, and I know Jimmy's gotta go do an Eyehategod tour in February. But after that, I think we're looking to do some shows {{starting}} in March. Maybe local around here, maybe even some Mardi Gras gigs. But yeah, last week we sat around and they played me some new stuff they're working on, and it sounds good. Sounds like it's got a lot of promise, and really they just need me in the fuckin' practice room. So all {{this is going to happen}} this year. It has to happen. I know there's a responsibility here. Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don't want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it. We've demoed other songs, there's songs that haven't even been released that people have never <b>heard,</b> <b>so</b> there's always Down there. For all you people out there, don't you stress. We got the Down coming." ...|$|E

500|$|Though the Ministry of Transport {{was adamant}} that the {{services}} {{should not be}} destinations in their own right, they did acquire {{a reputation for being}} a popular place for motorists to visit. During the 1960s, the services were a regular stopping venue for bands such as Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones. The Beatles stopped at Watford Gap while travelling from Liverpool to gigs in the south in the early stage of their career. Jimi Hendrix <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> much about [...] "Blue Boar", as the services were then popularly known, that {{he thought it was a}} London nightclub. Gerry Marsden, leader of the Pacemakers regularly visited the services when touring, saying it was good for [...] "a quick stop and a quick nosh." [...] The Floyd's Nick Mason recalls Hendrix stopping off at the services at 2am, while The Zombies' Chris White thought the services were [...] "the feeding trough of the beat boom". Harper claimed [...] "everybody would meet at Watford Gap because it was the one place after a show where you were guaranteed a bit of a sit-down at 2am".|$|E
500|$|In London {{early in}} 1837, Morrell {{attempted}} to convert {{some of the}} purloined cargo into cash, but word of his activities had spread, and the proceeds were immediately confiscated by agents acting for Margaret Oakleys insurers. His reputation as a probable fraud prevented him from finding new employment; he sought work with the shipping firm of Enderby Brothers, but Charles Enderby said that [...] "he had <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> much of [...] {{that he did not}} think fit to enter into any engagement with him." [...] Thwarted in London, Morrell turned his attention to France. He had heard that d'Urville was organising an expedition to the Antarctic, and on June 20, 1837, wrote to the French Geographical Society in Paris to offer his services: [...] "I will engage to place the Proud Banner of France ten degrees nearer the Pole than any other Banner has ever been planted, providing I can obtain the command of a Small schooner ...properly manned and equipped". His offer was declined; Morrell was by now regarded as a fraud in France as well as in Britain and America.|$|E
500|$|Wayne Pommen, the first-choice Cambridge bow, {{was injured}} {{two days before}} the race, {{fracturing}} his wrist following a full-speed collision with the harbourmaster's launch during a practice start. [...] Matthias Kleinz was hit on the head but did not require medical attention. Cambridge number seven James Livingston said: [...] "For a couple of seconds I thought I was going to die. [...] We were going flat out {{and all of a sudden}} I heard Jim's voice. [...] I've never <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> much fear in anybody's voice before." [...] Pommen was circumspect: [...] "A few of us were feeling quite lucky last night... at the same time, it was very frustrating and disappointing... but there was no point sulking in the corner." [...] Three oars were destroyed and two riggers bent; the boat was sent to Weybridge to be repaired. [...] Pommen was replaced by Ben Smith, brother of the Oxford stroke Matthew. [...] Not since the 1979 race had such a late change in the line-up of a crew been made. Along with James and David Livingston, this was the first time in the history of the Boat Race that two pairs of brothers would be racing against one another.|$|E
6000|$|... "An {{excellent}} test," [...] he said. [...] "If you can amuse ME {{with that}} story {{you must be}} a wonder. I've <b>heard</b> it <b>so</b> often that it has no more interest for me than the alphabet." ...|$|R

500|$|Harris was {{followed}} into the witness-box by {{a succession of}} landladies, waitresses and other women, all of whom confirmed Davidson's habitual pestering without making any serious accusation of misconduct. [...] When Davidson himself took to the stand, on 25 May, his light-hearted, even flippant, manner created, says Tucker, [...] "the flavour of a comedy routine with the rector's counsel as straight man". Davidson's disastrous finances were aired—he took great offence when his association with Gordon was presented as a [...] "partnership in crime". [...] He caused disbelief and amusement in the court when, questioned about the boil-lancing incident with Rose Ellis, he professed not to know what a [...] "buttock" [...] was, claiming: [...] "It is a phrase I have honestly never <b>heard.</b> <b>So</b> far as I remember {{it is a little}} below the waist." [...] At this stage, only Harris's largely uncorroborated testimony had provided specific allegations of immorality; the rest of the evidence was inconclusive and it seemed that the prosecution might fail. Davidson's cause was severely damaged, however, when Oliver produced a photograph of him, taken on 28 March 1932, with a nearly naked girl. She was Estelle Douglas, the 15-year-old daughter of one of Davidson' oldest friends. Davidson explained that the picture had been intended as a publicity shot to help the girl find work as an actress. He protested that he had been set up, and did not know she was naked under her shawl; he thought she was wearing a bathing suit, as she had been in an earlier photograph. [...] On 6 June, after closing speeches from both sides, the court adjourned until 8 July to allow the chancellor, who alone would determine the outcome, to consider the evidence.|$|E

2500|$|Sydney's Muslim leaders, {{including}} Keysar Trad, have {{condemned the}} actions of suicide bombers and denounced ISIS.
