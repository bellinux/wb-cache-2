25|$|In early 2013, Ringwald {{released}} Except Sometimes, a jazz record. It {{follows a}} tradition in jazz for the Ringwald family set by her father. “I {{grew up in a}} home filled with music and had an early appreciation of jazz since my dad was a jazz musician. Beginning at around age three I started singing with his band and jazz music has continued to be one of my three passions along with acting and writing. I like to say jazz music is my musical equivalent of comfort food. It's always where <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> when I want to feel grounded,” Ringwald said in a statement.|$|E
500|$|Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives {{was named}} {{as one of}} the best albums of 2001 by several publications, {{including}} Pitchfork, Ottawa Citizen and Rolling Stone. The Globe & Mail named it the seventh best album of the year, with Carl Wilson writing that [...] "of all the electronica-glich-IDM this year, [...] is the only one <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> as if it were the Rolling Stones." [...] In 2005, Pitchfork ranked the album the 84th best of 2000-2004. Herren was overwhelmed with the positive reception the album received, exclaiming that [...] "Most of it was so positive, but I'd also get a really strong reaction from people- some that want to kill me, 'cause they're under the impression that I'm trying to kill hip hop or something, and I'm like 'uh see ya, whatever man.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In an October 2007 {{preliminary}} hearing {{for the case}} of Dr. Maurice Wolin, Dr. Wolin's attorney Blair Berk argued that Perverted Justice's founder has a financial incentive to badger suspects. Von Erck testified in the hearing that he is paid an annual salary of $120,000 stemming from Perverted Justice's deal with NBC. Said Berk, [...] "Xavier Von Erck had a problem. He had a television show to get on and a fancy cancer doctor to ensnare in his web, and he wouldn't let it go." [...] The prosecutor in the case, Brian Staebell, stated, [...] "The whole business of this {{preliminary hearing}} has been {{an attack on the}} Petaluma Police Department and Perverted Justice. But every time <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the chats and I look at how he was grooming this 13-year-old girl." [...] After the hearing, Judge Raima Ballinger held Wolin over for trial, ruling that there was sufficient cause to believe Wolin committed the crime.|$|E

2500|$|Zander Hollander, {{who wrote}} The Complete Handbook of Pro Football, said about Gradishar, [...] "Not as nasty as Butkus, doesn't snarl like Lambert, but Gradishar {{makes all the}} plays. Hey, he can hit, too. Just ask Saints' Henry Childs, after Gradishar knocked his helmet off, [...] "It {{was the first in}} my career like that, in the open field". Gradishar's hitting ability was a {{sentiment}} echoed in Rick Korch's book, The Truly Great. In it, Tony Dorsett recalled the hit Gradishar gave him in a 1980 game, [...] "I ran a pass pattern and was wide open but Danny White did not see me. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the huddle and tell Danny that I am wide open. I ran the same route again but this time I was almost decapitated. My eyes were only partially open when I hit the ground. Trainers and doctors came running onto the field. They thought I was dead. Hey, I thought I was dead, too." [...] Hall of Fame defensive lineman Dan Hampton remembers asking Walter Payton, [...] "Walter, who gave you the hardest hit you ever took in the NFL?". According to Hampton, Payton replied, [...] "Randy Gradishar, 1978". In 1981 SPORT magazine named Gradishar one of the Top 5 hardest hitters in the NFL, quoting the modest Gradishar, [...] "The chance for a real good shot comes very seldom, but when it's there I take full advantage of it".|$|E
2500|$|He {{focused on}} his {{opposition}} to abortion and gun control, {{as well as his}} support for lower taxes and free-market health care solutions. [...] He told the CPAC audience that he arrived in Washington as [...] "a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution", and addressed the issue of illegal immigration - one of the major issues where conservatives have attacked McCain. He said that [...] "it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first", before addressing other immigration laws. [...] Mike Huckabee spoke to CPAC two days later and said, [...] "I know that there was some speculation that I might come here today to announce that I would be getting out of the race. But I {{want to make sure you}} understand. Am I quitting? Well, let's get that settled right now. No, I'm not. And the reason is simple—I never learned arithmetic. You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular to be a Republican or a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others. Let others join the [...] "Me, too" [...] crowd. But I didn't get where I am today and I didn't fight the battles in a state that, when I became its governor, was 90 percent Democrat, by simply echoing the voices of others. I did it by staking out a choice, stating that choice, making that choice and fighting for that choice, to believe that some things were right, some things were wrong, and it's better to be right and even to not win than it is to be wrong and to be a part of the crowd." ...|$|E
