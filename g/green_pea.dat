5|$|Cowpeas {{are grown}} mostly for their edible beans, {{although}} the leaves, green peas and <b>green</b> <b>pea</b> pods {{can also be}} consumed, meaning the cowpea {{can be used as}} a food source before the dried peas are harvested. Like other legumes, cowpea grain is cooked to make it edible, usually by boiling. Cowpeas can be prepared in stews, soups, purees and casseroles, but the most common way to eat them is in curries. They can also be processed into a paste or flour. Chinese long beans can be eaten raw or cooked, but as they easily become waterlogged are usually sautéed, stir-fried, or deep-fried.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, two {{separate}} sources have identified two <b>Green</b> <b>Pea</b> galaxies (GPs) to be likely Lyman Continuum (LyC)-emitting candidates. This {{suggests that these}} two GPs are low-redshift analogs of high-redshift Lyman-alpha and LyC emitters, only two others of which are known: Haro 11 and Tololo-1247-232. Finding local LyC emitters {{is crucial to the}} theories about the early universe and the epoch of reionization. These two GPs have SDSS DR9 reference numbers: 1237661070336852109 (GP_J1219) and 1237664668421849521.|$|E

Erb {{published}} {{a paper in}} the Astrophysical Journal entitled, [...] "Lyα Emission from Green Peas: The Role of Circumgalactic Gas Density, Covering, and Kinematics". In this paper, ten <b>Green</b> <b>Peas</b> were studied in the ultraviolet, using high resolution spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. This study showed, for the first time, that <b>Green</b> <b>Peas</b> have strong Lyα emission much like distant, high-redshift galaxies observed in a younger universe. Henry et al. explored the physical mechanisms that determine how Lyα escapes from the <b>Green</b> <b>Peas,</b> and concluded that variations in the neutral hydrogen column density {{were the most important}} factor.

25|$|In Iceland, the day {{is known}} as Sprengidagur (Bursting Day) and is marked by eating salted meat and peas. In Lithuania, {{the day is}} called Užgavėnės.

In Finland, the day is called laskiainen and is generally celebrated by eating <b>green</b> <b>pea</b> soup and a pastry called laskiaispulla (sweet bread filled with whipped cream and jam or almond paste, same as the Swedish semla). The celebration often includes downhill sledging. In Estonia, the day is called Vastlapäev and is generally celebrated by eating pea soup and whipped-cream or whipped-cream and jam filled sweet-buns called vastlakukkel, similar to the Swedish fastlagsbulle or semla.
