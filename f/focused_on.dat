50|$|<b>Focus</b> <b>on</b> form (FonF) is an {{approach}} to language education in which learners are {{made aware of the}} grammatical form of language features that they are already able to use communicatively.

For a teaching intervention to qualify as <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> form and not as <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> forms, the learner must be aware of the meaning and use of the language features before the form is brought to their attention. <b>Focus</b> <b>on</b> form was proposed by Michael Long in 1988.|$|R
