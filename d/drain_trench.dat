The Reference Level of Correlation method, i. e. the RNK (Referentni nivo korelacije in Croatian) method, is a confirmed procedure enabling the establishment of such columns. In the engineering geological/geotechnical correlation column, the plasticity index is the most significant indicator of the peak friction angle, full-softening friction angle and residual friction angle for coherent soils and soft rock formations. As a rule, maximum plasticity index values correspond to the minimum values of such friction angles. This opens up the possibility of an exact engineering-geological/geotechnical model, with accurate differentiation of minimum shear strength zones, zones of different permeability, and zones of various degrees of natural compaction. This procedure was applied inter alia on the successfully improved Granice landslide located in the Zagreb area, where it was proven that elements for verification based on the RNK-method exist for all three areas of investigation: sliding body – <b>drain</b> <b>trench</b> section – detail in the central portion of the sliding zone.

Main focus is given to the elaboration of archaeological excavations, which were carried out in the years 1967 and 1968 by A. Knor and J. Zeman. The excavations followed up a large <b>drain</b> <b>trench</b> between Tuchlovice and Srby (district Kladno, Central Bohemia), where K.

Thirteen probes unearthed relatively widely spread rests of settlement, which was probably buried by a flood. The analysis of pottery sherds allows dating of the excavated settlement mainly to the 1. st century AD. Sampled wooden finds were submitted to dendrochronological surveys, but the recorded tree ring curve didn't match any so far known. Most important finds are a part of wooden fence and a piece from composite wooden jar. Other wooden artifacts and finds do not allow any functional interpretation.

40|$|Until {{the seventies}} storage of toxic {{pollutants}} in The Netherlands was (and {{in some countries}} still) done carelessly. The chemicals were often dumped in landfills which were designed for domestic waste. This carelessness has led to many soil contaminations which form ecological and human risks for the direct environment. Nowadays, governments and companies are therefore obliged to remediate such historic contaminations. Remediation of chemical landfills is often done with unsustainable techniques such as, wastemining (excavation, sorting and relocating or incinerating) or complete isolation. In this study the feasibility and efficiency of a draining trench for the remediation or stabilization of a groundwater contamination, in this case from a chemical landfill, is studied. Essential for {{this study is the}} value which organic material (peat or green compost) could add to this remediation concept, named the adsorption drain. This technique could form a sustainable and cost effective solution for locations were other techniques prove to be too expensive. For this research, hydraulic conductivity (column) and adsorption (batch) experiments have been done on five types of peat and green compost. Peat type 05 and green compost were selected for further research, because these materials seemed to have the highest potential for application in the adsorption <b>drain</b> (<b>trench).</b> Additional adsorption experiments (batch and column) were conducted on the materials. Benzene was selected as contaminant, because benzene is a critical pollutant in groundwater plumes (also in the landfill leachate of Zeeland). Benzene is therefore a determining pollutant for the success of the adsorption drain. From the results of the column and batch experiments a retardation factor between 3. 84 and 4. 9 is found for peat 05. This corresponds to a Kd value between 22. 9 and 31. 1 l/kg for adsorption of benzene to peat 05. The retardation factor and Kd value of green compost showed a larger variation, because benzene seemed be more adsorbed during the column experiments. A retardation factor between 2. 84 and 4. 4 is found for green compost, which corresponds with a Kd value between 3. 49 and 6. 45 l/kg. A MODFLOW groundwater model was used for a sensitivity analysis concerning the working of the adsorption drain. The interception depth of the trench and the residence time of groundwater in the trench are the most important properties for the remediating effect. The goal of the model was to demonstrate the influence of different hydrological parameters on these properties. It is shown that mainly the drain bed resistance and the drain discharge influence the residence time. The natural groundwater flux is the most important factor regarding the interception depth for a specific drainage discharge. The roll of biodegradation in the adsorption drain is only appointed and estimated in this study. Future research should show if organic material, used as in the adsorption drain, could stimulate biodegradation in the adsorption material and in the surface water. In general it could be concluded that the feasibility and efficiency of a remediation with an adsorption <b>drain</b> (<b>trench)</b> depends mainly on the local hydrological- and contaminant situation. Shallow pollutants in slowly flowing groundwater are desirable when such a system is applied. This implies that the drainage of the trench can be low which increases the lifespan of the organic material that is used as adsorption medium. Besides that, benzene retardation for the studied materials appeared lower than expected. This is probably caused by the low specific surface and low organic carbon content of green compost and the relatively low density of peat. Relative little organic carbon per volume peat is available, due to the low density. The adsorption capacity and therefore the lifespan of organic material as adsorption medium will however be larger for contaminants with a higher partitioning coefficient than benzene...|$|E

40|$|Chapter 1 The Ebro basin is {{situated}} in north-eastern Spain and forms a geographic unit bounded by high mountains. The Bardenas area lies in the Ebro basin and forms part of the Bardenas Alto - Aragón irrigation scheme, {{which was designed to}} make use of the surface water resources from the Pyrenees. Chapter 2 The Ebro basin is a tertiary sedimentation basin in which the Ebro river and its main tributaries have incised alluvial valleys. The tertiary sediments consist mainly of mudstone, locally with interbedded gypsum layers, and very fine siltstone. Both sedimentary rocks are fine textured and, because they were deposited in a brackish lacustrine environment, contain harmful soluble salts. The main landscape-forming processes were erosion, transport, and deposition under semi-arid climatic conditions. The highest parts of the landscape consist of old tertiary formations which form the uplands of a dissected plain. At a lower level mesas occur, which consist of coarse alluvium covering the underlying tertiary sediments. Most of the eroded sediments were removed from the area but local sedimentation also occurred. Owing to the semi-arid conditions, both sediments and salts were deposited. The highest salt concentrations are found in the lowest parts of the alluvial formations, especially where the alluvium was derived from the eroded mudstone and siltstone. Between the residual uplands and the low-lying alluvial formations, piedmont and colluvial slopes occur. Within the Bardenas area ten major physiographic units were defined, each of them subdivided into minor components and indicated on the soil map. The Ebro basin is the driest part of northern Spain. The climate is semi-arid and becomes drier from the borders to the centre of the depression. The seasonal variation in temperature is great. Potential evapotranspiration exceeds total precipitation, which is extremely variable and is not concentrated in distinct rainy seasons. Wind velocity is high and both cold and warm dry winds are common. Evaporation thus occurs even in winter when temperatures are low. A great part of the area is cultivated, so that natural vegetation is restricted to residual and eroded soils not used for agriculture and to salt-affected soils where halophytes grow. Irrigated farming is influenced by soil conditions. Salt-free soils are under full irrigation, the main crops being maize, lucerne, sugar beet, and some horticultural crops. The cropping pattern on the saline soils depends on the degree of salinity. Barley and sugar beet are grown on moderately saline soils and lucerne on succesfully leached soils. On the higher lands, not under the command of the irrigation scheme, barley is grown. Chapter 3 The study area comprises two drainage basins. The northern part drains to the Aragón river, the southern part to the Riguel river, which is a tributary of the Arba river. Drainage and salinity of the groundwater depend on the situation of each geomorphological unit and its relation to adjacent units. The groundwater in the fluvio-colluvial formations of the northern basin is shallow and highly saline. An ephemeral perched water table is found in the mesas, where the groundwater is non-saline. No shallow water table was found in other physiographic units. The irrigation water is of good quality as its EC is at the lower end of the C 2 -range. The SAR is also in the lowest range S 1 and the RSC is zero, so there is no danger of alkalinization. Chapter 4 The physiographic approach was used to prepare the soil map. Each mapping unit is a broad association of soils having similar salinity hazards and possibilities of reclamation. Five main soil associations were distinguished:a) The residual soils of the siltstone outcrops, which have only a thin surface horizon overlying the hard siltstone. b) The soils of the mesas, which consist of a reddish loamy surface horizon overlying semi-consolidated coarse alluvium rich in calcium- carbonate but free of other salts. This in turn overlies the impervious mudstone. Texture and depth of the soil profile vary. Where moderately deep soils occur. a prosperous irrigated agriculture flourishes. c) The soils of the piedmont and colluvial slopes were developed from a mixture of fine colluvium. and material from the underlying tertiary sediments. They are generally deep and fine textured and have an intrinsic, though variable, salinity, increasing with depth. Because of the low permeability and the salinity of the subsoil, the most suitable irrigation method is sprinkling. d) The non-saline soils of the alluvial valleys of the main rivers. Soil conditions vary greatly, but the older terrace soils are usually shallower and less suitable for irrigation than the youngest deeper (alluvial) soils. In general, prosperous irrigated agriculture exists on these soils. e) The saline alluvial and fluvio-colluvial soils of valleys and fans, whose parent material was derived from denudation of the tertiary sediments. Soil conditions and the degree of salinity vary in each mapping unit, and consequently the possibilities of reclamation vary as well. Chapter 5 The source of the salts is the intrinsic salinity of the parent materials and the secondary salinization in water-receiving areas that lack natural drainage. Under irrigation the mobilization and redistribution of salts continues and salinity increases. The saline soils of the area are mainly affected by sodium chloride, a component dominant in all samples. In addition, calcium and magnesium sulphates are found in the northern basin, while in the southern part, calcium and magnesium chlorides predominate over the sulphates. The SAR increases with the rise of EC. Soil alkalinity can therefore be regarded as a reflection of soil salinity since highly saline soils are sodic as well. Non-saline alkali soils were not found and pH-values greater than 8. 5 do not occur. The results of crop tolerance field tests correspond well with the generally accepted levels for salt tolerance. The continued use of the slightly saline soils can be ensured by maintaining the present drainage system of open ditches and interceptor drains, and by keeping the soils under full irrigation. The normal percolation losses associated with basin irrigation will be sufficient to leach the salts from the rootzone. Sprinkler irrigation is suitable for the soils of the slopes, since no levelling is needed and the small water applications reduce the seepage of saline water. The only drainage system required is an interceptor drain between the slope and the adjacent valley. Chapter 6 The saline alluvial soils require reclamation. For this purpose, they must be provided with a drainage system, followed by initial leaching to reduce their salt content. Because there was no local experience with such drainage and desalinization processes, it was decided to conduct an experimental reclamation. Two experimental fields were subsequently selected. The Alera field represents the poorly drained soils of the fluvio-colluvial formations of the northern basin. These are silty-clay soils whose porosity and permeability decrease with depth. Below a depth of 1. 5 m the soil becomes almost impermeable. Salinity increases with depth, reaching values of between 20 and 35 mmhos/cm in the almost impermeable layer. Soil salinity in the surface layer varies. The Valareña field represents the saline soils of alluvial valleys and fans in the southern drainage basin. These are silty clay loam soils showing a marked stratification. At a depth of 2. 5 m, coarse alluvium saturated with very saline groundwater occurs overlying impervious mudstone. Because of stratification, the hydraulic conductivity is highly anisotropic. Soil salinity is more uniformly distributed than in the Alera soils. The reclamation process consisted of the following phases:a) Theoretical design of the drainage system based on hydrological soil properties measured by conventional field methods and on assumed drainage criteria. b) Implementation of the drainage system in the experimental fields. c) Collection of field data, followed by determination of the actual hydrological soil properties and of the drainage criteria. d) Design of the definitive drainage system which will form the basis of recommendations for the reclamation of saline soils with similar conditions. Chapter 7 After a detailed hydropedological survey, a drain spacing of 20 m at a depth of 1. 5 m was calculated for both the Alera and the Valareña drainage systems. Both fields were subsoiled to a depth of 50 cm to improve their low infiltration rates. Piezometers were installed to monitor the water table. Precipitation was measured, as were the amounts of irrigation and drainage water. Soil samples were taken at fixed sites to determine the salinity during the leaching process. Chapter 8 At the Valareña field, water flowed directly into the <b>drain</b> <b>trench</b> through the upper layer of soil, in which the stratification had been disrupted by levelling and subsoiling. Below this layer, there was no percolation of water and therefore no desalinization. These soils cannot be leached merely by the provision of a drainage system but also require deep subsoiling. At the Alera field, unsteady groundwater flow prevailed. At the end of tail recession, flow conditions approached those of steady flow. The discharge/hydraulic head relation had a parabolic shape showing that flow was restricted to the soil above drain level because the drains had been placed just above the impervious layer. The Boussinesq theory was very suitable to study the drainage of the Alera field. At the end of tail recession, if the term for flow below drain level was disregarded, the Hooghoudt equation could be applied. Drainable pore space was determined from the fall of the water table and the amount of drainage water during periods of low evapotranspiration. An average value of 4 per cent was found. The hydraulic conductivity was calculated from the discharge/hydraulic head relation using the Boussinesq and Hooghoudt equations for periods of low evapotranspiration. In general good agreement was found among the values obtained. It could thus be concluded that:- Hydraulic conductivity decreases with depth, becoming negligible below drain level. - The hydraulic conductivity between a depth of 0. 5 m and drain level equals about 0. 6 m/day, and is about 1. 5 m/day in the upper layer. - For high water table conditions, the average hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile is 1 m/day. A comparison of hydraulic conductivity values obtained with field and laboratory methods and those obtained from the discharge/hydraulic head relation showed that:- The results obtained with the auger hole method (K = 0. 2 m/day) were lower than those derived from the discharge/hydraulic head relation. - No satisfactory results were obtained from the inversed auger hole measurements above the water table. - The results obtained from laboratory measurements in undisturbed soil cores showed the anisotropy of the soil. The entrance resistance (W e) of different combinations of drainage and filter materials was calculated from the drain discharge and the head loss of the water table measured in the <b>drain</b> <b>trench</b> (h i). Another method, by which the head loss in the trench was calculated from the shape of the water table was also applied. Both methods gave similar results, yielding the following conclusions:- The W e -values remained fairly constant with time, except for plastic pipes-with an envelope of esparto or coconut fibre for which an increase in W e was observed. - The best combination was clay pipes with a gravel cover (W e = 2 day/m). - Corrugated PVC-pipes with gravel covering and clay pipes without gravel may be used also (W e = 5 day/m). - Corrugated plastic pipes without a filter gave less satisfactory results (W e = 13 day/m). - Plastic pipes with coconut fibre and esparto filters showed an even higher W e than plastic pipes without a filter. - Barley straw is an unsuitable cover material since it rots easily and clogs the pipe. Chapter 9 The desalinization of the Alera field started with an initial leaching, followed by the irrigated cultivation of moderately salt- resistant crops. The leaching efficiency coefficient was determined by comparing the actual desalinization process with theoretical models. Thus the leaching requirement could be predicted for different initial salt contents. To exclude the influence of slightly soluble salts, the desalinization curves were drawn in terms of chloride content. The correlation between chloride percentage and electrical conductivity was high. The following conclusions emerged from the study of the leaching process:- The leaching efficiency coefficient was not constant but increased with depth. - The leaching efficiency coefficient was higher at the beginning of the desalinization process and decreased gradually as the soil became less saline. - The calculated values reflected the differences in soil structure. - An average value of 0. 5 was determined for the upper layer (0 - 50 cm), and a value of 1. 0 for the deeper layer (50 - 100 cm). - The initial salinity was related to soil physical properties (infiltration rate and permeability) which, in turn, were dependent on the compactness of the soil. - For an initial EC e of 15 mmhos/cm, approximately 1000 mm of percolation water are required, which meant 1100 to 1400 mm of irrigation water. The leaching period could last up to 8 months, from early autumn to late May. - Deep subsoiling and local gypsum applications improved the structure of the upper soil layer. - The leaching of saline soils could be split into two phases: an initial leaching of the upper layer, followed by the irrigated cultivation of a moderately salt-resistant crop (sugar beet), during which percolation losses leached the deeper layers. - There was no risk of alkalinization during the leaching period. - To prevent secondary salinization after reclamation, good drainage conditions must be maintained and an irrigated crop rotation practised. Chapter 10 From the relation between the depth of the water table, crop growth, and the mobility of agricultural machinery on the soil, and from a study of the groundwater regime in winter and during the irrigation season drainage criteria for unsteady-state conditions were derived. These criteria were converted to steady-state criteria for easier use in drainage projects. The following conclusions could be drawn from the study:- Little harm is done to winter cereals if a water table remains within a depth of 50 cm, for no more than 3 consecutive days. - With a water table between 75 and 100 cm, sugar beet grows well and is not harmed if a water table is within the top 50 cm for 3 to 4 consecutive days. - Lucerne is more sensitive than sugar beet to high water tables. For good yields, a water table must not remain longer than 3 days within the top 25 cm of soil, 4 or 5 days within the top 50 cm, and 5 or 6 days within the top 75 cm. - A water table depth shallower than 65 cm prevents the movement of machinery and hampers seed-bed preparation in winter. The following drainage criteria were assessed:a) In winter, a water table drawdown from the soil surface to a depth of 0. 65 m in 8 days. b) In the irrigation season, a water table rise of 0. 7 m caused by irrigation losses must be lowered in the 12 days between two consecutive irrigations, and must be deeper than 0. 7 m after 7 days. Applying these criteria in the Boussinesq equation for unsteady flow and using the values for hydraulic conductivity and drainable pore space determined at the experimental field, a spacing of 25 m for drains installed at a depth of 1. 2 m was obtained. Equivalent drainage criteria for steady flow are a minimum depth of 0. 5 m for the unsaturated zone, with a corresponding hydraulic head midway between drains of 0. 7 m and a drain discharge of 3 mm/day. If the entrance resistance was taken into account, the Ernst equation for steady flow and the Hellinga/de Zeeuw equation for unsteady flow could be used in calculating the drain spacing. The results obtained by both approaches agree well and allowed the following conclusions:- For drainage and filter materials with a high entrance resistance, the drain density (m/ha) required becomes twice that needed for materials with low entrance resistance. - Material with high entrance resistance involves much more risk of failure than a wider spacing with good material...|$|E

40|$|Tile {{drainage}} systems are sometimes {{not sufficient to}} provide favorable unsaturated conditions in the rootzone. These {{drainage systems}} then need to be supplemented with an additional high conductivity material in the trenches above the tiles or by implementing mole drainage. The HYDRUS (2 D/ 3 D) model {{was used to evaluate}} the impact of such additional measures for heavy clay soil. Three types of drainage systems were simulated: (i) tile drains, (ii) tile <b>drains</b> with gravel <b>trenches,</b> and (iii) tile <b>drains</b> with gravel <b>trenches</b> and mole <b>drains,</b> using either two-dimensional (the former two systems) or three-dimensional (the latter one) transport domains. Three scenarios were considered to test the efficiency of each system: (i) time to drain an initially saturated system, (ii) high intensity rainfall, and (iii) a real case scenario. Different horizontal spacings between tile drains with or without gravel trenches were also compared with the system which included mole drainage. The results showed that the drainage system that included mole <b>drains</b> and gravel <b>trenches</b> was the most efficient. This system provided the largest drainage rate, was the first to reach steady-state in the time to drain scenario, and also efficiently reduced surface runoff. Adding mole drains to a system with tile <b>drains</b> and gravel <b>trenches</b> resulted in a large reduction of surface runoff (75 %). Simulations showed that the spacing of tile drains with or without gravel trenches would have to be 40 % or 55 % smaller, respectively, in order to reproduce the same water table levels as those observed for the drainage system with mole drains. Therefore, introducing mole drains in drainage systems is an efficient practice for reducing waterlogging and runoff. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

50|$|A {{slot drain}} is a linear drain used to {{evacuate}} ground water. The {{difference between a}} slot drain and the traditional <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> is that the slot drain {{does not have any}} kind of grating. In recent years, this drainage concept is more often used in both indoor and outdoor applications, such as fire halls, car washes, landscaping, shower rooms and garages.|$|R
40|$|After a {{long period}} of quiescence, in mid-November 1994 a large ancient slope movement, over 3000 m long, 1000 m wide and up to 120 m deep, {{classified}} as a slow, intermittent complex-type landslide resumed its activity, striking the village of Corniglio in the Parma Apennines (Northern Italy). The movement developed within arenaceous, calcareous and clayey geological formations and consisted of multiple roto-translational slides in the upper and middle portion and translational slides in the toe portion associated with earth flows. The causes of the landslide are ascribable to decrease of geomechanical parameters, owing to weathering and seismic activity, and increase of porewater pressures, after periods of intense rainfall. In 1995, during a phase of quiescence, the following works were carried out: thousands of trees displaced by the landslide were cut down, new topographic mapping of the landslide body was performed, the runoff network was re-established and <b>draining</b> <b>trenches</b> were dug to a depth of 12 m. Early in 1996, after a 4. 2 magnitude seismic shock hit the area, large new detachments occurred along rotational surfaces of rupture. In February 1996, the formation of tension cracks in the ground and fissures in several buildings and streets of the village followed mass re-mobilisation of the ancient landslide body. Considering the landslide size and complexity, effective remedial measures seem to be rather uncertain and, in any case, very expensive. Nevertheless, monitoring equipment will be further improved with the setting up of fixed inclinometers and electric piezometers with automatic data acquisition to safeguard the most important built-up area...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{instability}} of existing railroad track substructures and embankments cause track deflections that require frequent maintenance, slow orders, and overall inefficiency of railroad operations. Substructure instability {{can be caused}} weak subgrade soils, poor-quality ballast, or inadequate thickness of the ballast and subballast layers. Typical problems that develop are subgrade shear failure, ballast pocket formation, and fouled ballast. As these problems develop, drainage becomes inhibited {{and the presence of}} water accelerates the problem. Slope instability problems that affect rail operations include embankment fill slope failures and landslides in natural slopes. Water, or water pressure, is often the primary cause of these types of instability. <b>Trench</b> <b>drains</b> are simple ballast-filled excavations that provide an effective means of draining water from the track substructure, embankment slopes and landslide areas. Removing water from these environments can lead to an immediate improvement in stability. <b>Trench</b> <b>drains</b> are extremely adaptable to various site and subsurface conditions. They provide several advantages over other stabilization methods currently in use. They are simple to understand, economical to construct, and have proven effective on thousands of sites around the country...|$|R

A French drain can have perforated hollow pipes along the bottom (see images) to quickly vent water that seeps down through the upper gravel or rock.|$|R
40|$|Water {{flow through}} road {{structures}} {{is a topic}} of great interest in civil engineering, as water {{is one of the}} factors that most affects the hydraulic and mechanical behavior of road materials. Efficient design of subsurface drainage improves the performance of road pavement. Conventional drainage systems, such as <b>trench</b> <b>drains</b> may not be wholly effective in reducing water-related problems, and in fact, may inadvertently reduce pavement performance and service life. This can be because conventional drainage is projected in saturated conditions; however, most water flow near the surface occurs under unsaturated conditions. This paper presents an experimental study to design a new prefabricated prototype for the subsurface drainage of road pavements (SubDrain). SubDrain has been designed by using rapid prototyping Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) with powder polyamide material and experimental validation tests, with the aim to evaluate the mechanical and hydraulic behavior of the prototype. The results of this study show that the new prefabricated prototype is a potential technology solution to replace the conventional <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> systems currently used in road projects. Findings in this study are limited to a prototype tested only under laboratory conditions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- Geosynthetics {{are used}} in forest {{engineering}} applications for soil stabilization, where the basic functions are reinforcement, separation, filtration and drainage. In many routine applications, the basis for selection of an appropriate geosynthetic is with reference to standard specification documents, using material properties reported by the manufacturer. Recommendations for best practices in such routine applications are reported, from a detailed case report involving stabilization of a cutslope. Further considerations are identified from additional construction applications that include roads, steam channels, a <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> and log culverts...|$|R
50|$|The {{idea behind}} SuDS {{is to try}} to {{replicate}} the drainage patterns of natural systems by using cost-effective solutions with low environmental impact to drain away dirty and surface water run-off through collection, storage, and cleaning before allowing it to be released slowly back into the environment, such as into water courses. This is to counter the effects of conventional drainage systems that often allow for flooding, pollution of the environment - with the resultant harm to wildlife - and contamination of groundwater sources used to provide drinking water. The paradigm of SuDS solutions should be that of a system that is easy to manage, requiring little or no energy input (except from environmental sources such as sunlight, etc.), resilient to use, and being environmentally as well as aesthetically attractive. Examples of this type of system are basins (shallow landscape depressions that are dry most of the time when it's not raining), rain gardens (shallow landscape depressions with shrub or herbaceous planting), swales (shallow normally-dry, wide-based ditches), filter <b>drains</b> (gravel filled <b>trench</b> <b>drain),</b> bioretention basins (shallow depressions with gravel and/or sand filtration layers beneath the growing medium), reed beds and other wetland habitats that collect, store, and filter dirty water along with providing a habitat for wildlife.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel {{confirmed}} this, {{but from}} {{another point of}} view. War was his business, as the still woods could testify--but his hobby was his trenches. He had tapped the mountain streams and dug out a laundry where a man could wash his shirt and go up and be killed in it, all in a morning; had <b>drained</b> the <b>trenches</b> till a muddy stretch in them was an offence; and {{at the bottom of}} the hill (it looked like a hydropathic establishment on the stage) he had created baths where half a battalion at a time could wash. He never told me how all that country had been fought over as fiercely as Ypres in the West; nor what blood had gone down the valleys before his trenches pushed over the scalped mountain top. No. He sketched out new endeavours in earth and stones and trees for the comfort of his men on that populous mountain.|$|R
50|$|This {{installation}} {{method is}} by far the most labor-intensive. In addition, material cost is a function of the width of the grate used in the trench.There are three main reasons why this is labor-intensive: the outlet pipe position in the floor, the levelling of the trench grate in the floor, and integration of the waterproofing. If the outlet is not exactly in the centre, then the channel must be customized, increasing cost and time to construct.This can be overcome by the use of modular <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> systems. These allow the drain pipe to be connected anywhere along the trench, giving the builder and plumber more freedom to place the services, reducing construction time and costs, particularly in high-rise situations where moving plumbing services can be nearly impossible. Achieving a curbless or hobless entrance for special needs access is more readily achieved with a modular system, as the levelling of the shower floor to the bathroom floor is inherently problematic with non-modular systems as they have no on-site adjustment.Waterproofing is possibly the most critical aspect of the bathroom when integrating a channel/trench drain. There are two ways to approach the waterproofing issue. First is to develop a proprietary method where the waterproofing and <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> are a kit. Second is to separate the waterproofing and trench drain.The first method has the benefit of an 'all-in-one' solution, but the downside is cost and limitation of the system in varying applications, i.e. limited generally to bathroom application. The second method is generally safest as the waterproofing is completed using established proven methods that most building contractors are familiar with. A second benefit is when the waterproofing is a separate item all methods of waterproofing (cementeous, bitumized, fibreglassed, paint-on, sweat-on, lead-lined, copper pan etc.) can be utilized. This will allow a modular system to be used in many applications such as pools, balconies, thresholds, pedestrian areas, public areas, essentially most wet areas where a waterproofing system is required, be it on ground or above (suspended slab).Stainless steel <b>trench</b> <b>drains</b> can also be installed in a home's shower and in commercial locations like hospital rooms, changing rooms and operating rooms.|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>trench</b> <b>drains</b> in {{construction}} {{began with the}} commission by the British Airports Authority of a company called Gatic. Airports were {{in need of a}} form of trench drainage with fewer movable parts and less tendency to collapse under heavy traffic than the traditional drainage gratings. Gatic designed and engineered the first stainless steel slot drain, and it was installed first at Stanstead Airport in the UK, following which it was specified at Britain’s most famous airport - Heathrow. These airports continue to use stainless steel slot drainage both airside and landside for surface water drainage requirements.|$|R
5000|$|Just as the {{septic tank}} is sized {{to support a}} {{community}} of anaerobic organisms capable of liquifying anticipated amounts of putresible materials in wastewater, the drain field should be sized to support a community of aerobic soil microorganisms capable of decomposing the anaerobic septic tank's effluent into aerobic water. Hydrogen sulfide odors or iron bacteria may be observed in nearby wells or surface waters when effluent has not been completely oxidized prior to reaching those areas. [...] The biofilm {{on the walls of}} the <b>drain</b> field <b>trenches</b> will use atmospheric oxygen in the trenches to catabolize organic compounds in septic tank effluent. Groundwater flow is laminar in the aquifer soils surrounding the drain field. [...] Septic tank effluent with soluble organic compounds passing through the biofilm forms a mounded lens atop groundwater underlying the drain field. Molecular diffusion controls mixing of soluble organic compounds into groundwater and transport of oxygen from underlying groundwater or the capillary fringe of the groundwater surface to micro-organisms capable of catabolizing dissolved organic compounds remaining in the effluent plume.|$|R
