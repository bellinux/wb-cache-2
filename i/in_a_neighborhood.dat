5|$|The tornado {{initially}} formed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> {{just south}} of the downtown area; after demolishing a section of the downtown area, it moved on to the schools. The tornado then continued northeast crossing the Holly Hill and Dixie Drive areas. A quarter-mile-wide (400m) swath was devastated, with enormous damage reported to many houses and businesses, some of which were flattened. Several other schools and the local YMCA were among the damaged buildings. According to the Red Cross, 239 homes were destroyed, 374 sustained major damage, 529 sustained minor damage, and 251 homes were affected.|$|E
5|$|The tower sits at 401 North Wabash Avenue in the River North Gallery District, {{part of the}} Near North Side {{community}} area of Chicago. The building {{occupies the}} site vacated by the Chicago Sun-Times, one of the city's two major newspapers, and its location within the River North Gallery District places it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> that has had {{a high concentration of}} art galleries since the 1980s. The site, at the foot of Rush Street, is {{on the north side of}} the Chicago River just west of the Wrigley Building and the Michigan Avenue Bridge, and just east of Marina City and 330 North Wabash. The building is close to numerous Chicago landmarks; it borders the Michigan-Wacker District, which is a Registered Historic District. Parts of the building are visible throughout the city, and the entire length of the building is visible from boats on the river, as well as from locations to the east along the river, such as the mouth of Lake Michigan, the Lake Shore Drive Overpass, and the Columbus Drive Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{recording}} sessions {{got off the}} ground, Priestess encountered another problem – {{this time with the}} law. The band were working in a house <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> and the close proximity to other houses meant that they had to keep the amount of noise generated to a minimum. They had been assured that the house had not previously been served with noise violations of any kind, but after they had finished recording drums and many of the guitar parts, they learned that they had the volume set too high when working on the bass guitar tracks; law enforcement came to the door and forced them to take their work elsewhere because they were shaking neighboring houses with the noise they were generating. The band did so with no objection, quickly moving their equipment to another studio, although they recalled the incident rather humorously later. Schiffman was able to arrange for the group to use another facility as early as the following day, and the band moved production to that new location the night of the incident. The sessions were completed in November 2008.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a {{holomorphic}} {{function is}} a complex-valued function {{of one or}} more complex variables that is complex differentiable <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> of every point in its domain. The existence of a complex derivative <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> is a very strong condition, for it implies that any holomorphic function is actually infinitely differentiable and equal to its own Taylor series (analytic). Holomorphic functions are the central objects of study in complex analysis.|$|E
