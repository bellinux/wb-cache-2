50|$|The RCH set {{technical}} standards for cable connections between coaches for the remote operation of systems; they were initially {{used only for}} control of train lighting. These cables were known as RCH jumpers, and in the 1970s a system for push-pull trains was developed which used the RCH cable, {{eliminating the need for}} a separate control cable to be fitted to <b>intermediate</b> <b>coaches.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Talgo 250 Hybrid is a dual-voltage dual-power train {{equipped}} with variable gauge axles. The train is therefore {{also able to}} operate on non-electrified lines. A Talgo 250 Hybrid train consists of two power cars, two technical end coaches and nine Talgo VII <b>intermediate</b> <b>coaches.</b> The trains were developed for RENFE and classed initially as S-130H, later as S-730). They are rebuilt from existing Talgo 250 trains.|$|R
50|$|The Talgo 250 is a {{dual voltage}} {{electric}} train (AC/DC) equipped with variable gauge axles. This allows the units {{to be used}} on high-speed lines and on conventional broad gauge lines. A Talgo 250 train consists of two power cars and 11 Talgo VII <b>intermediate</b> <b>coaches.</b> This class was developed for RENFE (classed as S-130).

25|$|In May 2006 a {{modernization}} program was begun by the SBB for 120 of its trainsets. The motor cars and driving trailes are being refurbished and then matched with new air-conditioned low floor <b>intermediate</b> <b>coaches</b> to form Domino trains. The existing EW I and II coaches will, after well over 40 years of service, be scrapped. Further {{use of the}} trucks on these coaches is being considered. The 188 new intermediate cars are to be delivered coinciding with the modernization, which is forecast to take 7 years and should be complete by 2013.|$|R
50|$|Between 1994 and 1996, 42 cars (21 two-car sets) were {{refurbished}} by FAUR and Electroputere {{for service}} on Line M3, however for unknown reasons the refurbishment project was abandoned and these trainsets are currently stored at Berceni Depot. These trains were distinguished by a blue livery, and featured new technical equipment. An attempt {{to build more}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>coaches</b> {{to allow for a}} 3-car x 2 formation was abandoned in 1995. In 2000, most of the Astra IVA coaches were refurbished and equipped with new ATO and ATP signalling systems, allowing for partial driverless operation especially on Line M4.|$|R
50|$|The {{trainset}} {{was built}} with two Class 410 power cars built jointly by Krupp, Krauss-Maffei and Thyssen-Henschel, {{and up to}} three Class 810 <b>intermediate</b> <b>coaches,</b> of which two were built by Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm and one by DUEWAG and Linke-Hofmann-Busch. When one of the coaches was used for measurement purposes, {{the other two were}} used for demonstration of a modern high-speed train. The powercars weighed 78 tons each and had a maximum output of 3,640 kW. They were mostly based on the DB Class 120 locomotives developed earlier, but had been equipped with an aerodynamic outer hull and a corporate identity livery. In the summer of 1986, one of the coaches (810 001) was refurbished from a measurement coach to a demonstration coach.|$|R

50|$|The power {{cars were}} fitted with an English Electric 560 HP diesel engine, with {{electric}} transmission to two traction motors {{mounted on the}} rear bogie. The seating capacity of the power cars was 45, however after providing for wheelchair accommodation, this was reduced to 42. The vehicle also incorporated a guards/parcel compartment. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>coaches</b> were fitted with an additional door on each side to aid passenger flow and had a capacity of 87. The driving trailers had a small cab built at one end, which necessitated the removal of six seats. This cab was set to the left to preserve the gangway connection, so that two train sets could be coupled together and still allow passengers to travel between the trains. All three types are of integral construction, however the power cars, because of their weight, also have an underframe. They were similar to the UTA 70 Class, both mechanically and electrically.|$|R

50|$|Powers' {{ice hockey}} {{coaching}} career {{began when he}} was employed as a youth with the Eaton's department store chain, coaching the store's own team. Powers moved on to coaching amateur teams. In 1919-20, he coached Toronto Parkdale's senior team. In 1920-21, he coached the Port Colborne <b>intermediate</b> team. He <b>coached</b> the Westminster Ice Hockey Club in Boston in 1921-1922 and {{led them to the}} US Championship.|$|R
25|$|When new, {{the units}} were {{initially}} numbered {{in the range}} 001-091, but were later renumbered to 303 001-091 when TOPS was introduced. Each unit consisted of 3-cars coupled together in a semi-permanent formation, and up to four sets could be operated in multiple to form up to a 12-car formation. Although 6-car formations were frequently operated, 9-car formations were operated occasionally. 12-car formations were usually only seen {{as a result of}} train failures or ECS workings to the depots at Shields Road or Hyndland. The two outer carriages of each unit were driving trailers, with an <b>intermediate</b> motor <b>coach</b> containing the motor bogies and electrical equipment. Units operated from the standard 25 kV alternating current (AC) overhead power lines system, with power collection via a Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph on the motor coach. The technical description of the formation is DTSO+MBSO+BDTSO. Individual vehicle numbers are shown below.|$|R
50|$|The 2015 Georgia Bulldogs {{football}} team was the {{favorite to win}} the Eastern Division. The Bulldogs started off the season 4-0 with SEC wins over Vanderbilt 31-14 and South Carolina 52-20, where quarterback Greyson Lambert set a NCAA record for completion percentage in a game with 96% (24/25). On October 3, the #13 Alabama Crimson Tide came to Athens and defeated the Bulldogs 38-10. The next week the Dawgs traveled to Knoxville to face the Tennessee Volunteers. On Georgia's first offensive play of the game, Bulldog's running back Nick Chubb was tackled on the sideline and suffered a season-ending knee injury as Georgia loss their second game of the season. Three weeks later, the Bulldogs suffered their third loss of the season during the World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party at EverBank Field in Jacksonville, Florida to the Florida Gators 27-3, where third-string quarterback Faton Bauta started. The Bulldogs finish the regular season on a four-game winning streak including road wins over the Auburn Tigers 20-13 and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets 13-7. The day after the Georgia Tech game, head coach Mark Richt was fired after 15 seasons of head coach. Richt had a record of 145-51 as {{head coach of the}} Bulldogs. Georgia finished the season with a win over the Penn State Nittany Lions in the Taxslayer Bowl 24-17 under <b>intermediate</b> head <b>coach</b> Bryan McClendon in Jacksonville. The bowl win gave the Bulldogs a final 2015 season record of 10-3, which gave the senior class a total of 40 wins.|$|R
5000|$|When the 1999 inter-county championships got going, Seir Kieran again {{had four}} representatives on Michael Bond's panel. In addition, Damien Murphy, James Coakley and Joe Guinan were {{called up to}} the Offaly <b>Intermediate</b> panel, <b>coached</b> by Paddy Scales (St Rynagh's) with {{selectors}} Seamus Coakley (Seir Kieran) and Joe Cleary (Shinrone). The Intermediates were beaten by Kilkenny in June. In the Leinster Senior Hurling Semi-final on June 20, 1999, Offaly saw off Wexford by 3-17 to 0-15. Joe, Billy and Johnny Dooley pitched in for a combined 1-13, and Kevin Kinahan also played a stormer. In the Leinster Final on July 11, however, the reigning Leinster Champions, now coached by Brian Cody felled the reigning All Ireland Champions (Kilkenny 5-14, Offaly 1-16). Kilkenny's goals were scored by DJ Carey (2), Henry Shefflin, Charlie Carter and Brian McEvoy. With their pride severely stung, the Faithful County regrouped admirably. Antrim hit them with everything in the All Ireland Quarter-Final, but Offaly still won by 4-22 to 0-12. The All Ireland Semi-final on August 8, 1999 was only the second-ever meeting between Cork and Offaly in the Senior Hurling Championship, and Joe Dooley was the only player to span the fifteen years since the Centenary Final. Notwithstanding the wet and greasy conditions, the game became an instant classic of wet-day hurling, and the caliber of both sides' display was absolutely top-drawer. The Rebels shaded it by 0-19 to 0-16. Cork and Offaly each scored 0-12 from play, so the match turned on the frees awarded by the referee, Dickie Murphy. Another crucial factor was the maturity shown by Jimmy Barry-Murphy's gifted young team when Offaly's grip seemed to be tightening. In the aftermath, Johnny Pilkington expressed his side's perplexity at having played so brilliantly, and yet having lost the game: ...|$|R
5000|$|With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of coaching, many colleges and universities now offer coach training programs that are accredited by a professional association. Some courses offer a life coach certificate after just a few days of training, but such courses, if they are accredited at all, are considered [...] "à la carte" [...] training programs, [...] "which may or may not offer start to finish coach training," [...] according to the ICF. In contrast, [...] "all-inclusive" [...] training programs accredited by the ICF, for example, require a minimum of 125 student contact hours, 10 hours of mentor coaching and a performance evaluation process. This is very little training in comparison to the training requirements of some other helping professions: for example, licensure as a counseling psychologist in the State of California requires 3,000 hours of supervised professional experience. However, the ICF, for example, offers a [...] "Master Certified Coach" [...] credential that requires demonstration of [...] "2,500 hours (2,250 paid) of coaching experience with at least 35 clients" [...] and a [...] "Professional Certified Coach" [...] credential with fewer requirements. Other professional bodies similarly offer entry-level, <b>intermediate,</b> and advanced <b>coach</b> accreditation options. Some coaches are both certified coaches and licensed counseling psychologists, integrating coaching and counseling.|$|R
40|$|Visual search {{patterns}} {{have often}} been studied in the sport domain with comparisons between expert and novice performers. Less {{research has been done}} comparing the visual search patterns of judges and in particular comparing the search patterns between elite judges and coaches. This study examines the visual search patterns of an elite judge, an elite coach and a novice judge over three dressage tests. The participants watched and judged three dressage tests lasting approximately five minutes each whilst wearing the ASL 501 eye tracking device which recorded their eye gaze onto a video camera. Frame by frame analysis was completed for each participant on the eye tracking data and the number of fixations, the duration of the fixations and the location of the fixations were recorded. Analysis of the results found the two experts had similarities between their visual search patterns and as expected the novice judge had a greater number of fixations compared to the expert judge during two of the dressage tests. However, the expert judge had a lower duration time fixating than was expected compared to the novice judge and the expert coach. It is possible that the expert judge is able to process the information to make the decision more effectively. Therefore, {{more research is needed to}} explore the similarities of varying levels of expertise within sport to help develop and recognise what novice and <b>intermediate</b> judges or <b>coaches</b> need to improve to reach an elite standard and also to see if there are similarities or differences between elite performers, coaches and judges...|$|R
