The piece must <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> a single {{adjacent}} opposing piece, and land on an unoccupied {{space on the}} exact {{opposite side of the}} jumped piece from its starting location. The jumped opposing piece is removed from play. A piece cannot <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> two opposing pieces in one jump, nor may it <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> a piece of its own color or <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> a piece into a space that is occupied (whether by that player or his opponent). A piece can make multiple jumps in one turn, even changing direction from one jump to the next, as long as the prior rules are followed.|$|R

5|$|March 10 and 11 were {{dedicated}} to the scenes in Sang Min's warehouse. The team's assault of the warehouse was filmed by three separate units. Kono's fight sequence was included to assert to the audience {{that she would be}} a valuable asset to the team. In the scene where McGarrett shoots Sang Min's Mercedes-Benz before it crashes into a shipping container was done with two separate takes, the first of which involved O'Loughlin shooting blanks into a car. The car would swerve away. The second take saw the car crash into the container with O'Loughlin away from the shot as McGarrett was in close proximity to the car. The eighth day of filming was spent in a village of quonset huts where McGarrett and Danny chase Doran. In one part of the sequence, McGarrett <b>jumps</b> <b>over</b> the trunk of one car as it was hit from behind by another car. To make the scene a reality, the film crew made a three-part composite shot to ensure no harm came to O'Loughlin.|$|E
