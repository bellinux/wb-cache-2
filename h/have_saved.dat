5|$|A {{controversial}} fumble recovery by Sewanee may <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> the game. Auburn quarterback Reynolds Tichenor {{said it was}} a gift; {{the referee}} awarded Sewanee the ball, but he insisted Auburn recovered it. A double pass play to Warbler Wilson got the ensuing Sewanee touchdown. Bart Sims made the extra point to edge Auburn. Neither team managed to score in the second half. The delay from the crowd gathering on the field ran the game into darkness.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his retirement, Wilhelm had pitched in a then major league record 1,070 games. He is {{recognized}} as the first pitcher to <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> 200 games in his career, and the first pitcher to appear in 1,000 games. Wilhelm {{is one of the oldest}} players to have pitched in the major leagues; his final appearance was 16 days short of his 50th birthday.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Irwin continued, {{working with}} {{director}} Mark Strickson, to present The Ten Deadliest Snakes in the World. He appeared on several episodes of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

5|$|In November 2009 Altadhaug Municipality cut {{the budgets}} of youth organisations by an {{estimated}} NOK 400,000. Steinholt opposed this, {{saying that if}} the wages of the mayor and several other high-ranking politicians had been cut, the municipality could <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> NOK 487,000. In the 2009 parliamentary election Steinholt received 1,829 votes, again as Red Nordland's leading candidate.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{urged his}} aides {{to break the}} news gently to Ida, and to call off the mob that had set on Czolgosz—a request that may <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> his assassin's life. McKinley was taken to the Exposition aid station, where the doctor was unable to locate the second bullet. Although a {{primitive}} X-ray machine was being exhibited on the Exposition grounds, it was not used. McKinley was taken to the Milburn House.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ruskin {{is at the}} Trudy's {{murder scene}} when a guard, believing Ruskin to be Monk, informs him Leverett is the killer. When Stottlemeyer and Disher arrive at Leverett's car {{dealership}} to arrest him, Ruskin has already arrived and is keeping him as a hostage. Monk enters the dealership and stops Ruskin but is emotionally shaken when Ruskin says he could <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> Trudy. At the end, he talks with Dr. Kroger and cancels his trip.|$|E

5|$|Six of {{the dead}} were not wearing seat belts, while a seventh was not {{properly}} restrained. Greg Sypher, a collision analyst and principal Transport Canada investigator, later suggested that seat belts most likely would not <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> all the victims' lives. Randy Arseneau credits {{the fact that his}} son, Bradd Arseneau, was not wearing his seatbelt for Bradd's survival, saying that if Bradd had not been thrown to the floor just before the collision he may also have died.|$|E
5|$|Tallon did not concede a bye in England's first {{innings of}} 215 and his diving was {{estimated}} to <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> around 40runs. He caught Washbrook from Lindwall to leave England at 1/17, and later caught Laker from Johnson. Tallon was not needed in the second innings; Lindwall was promoted above Tallon because Australia needed quick runs and Lindwall was a big-hitter. Australia declared at 7/460, leaving England a target of 509.|$|E
5|$|The Aurora {{returned}} to Cape Denison the following summer, in mid-December, {{to take the}} men home.

5|$|Bohemond {{decided to}} recover Anazarbus and other territories {{which had been}} lost to the Cilician Armenia. He invaded Cilicia in February 1130, {{traveling}} along the Ceyhan River. Leo I of Cilicia sought assistance from the Danishmend Emir Gazi Gümüshtigin who made a surprise attack on Bohemond's army. Bohemond and his soldiers were massacred in the battle. According to Michael the Syrian, the Turks killed Bohemond {{because they did not}} recognize him; had they recognized him, they would <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> him so they could demand a ransom from him. Gümüshtigin had Bohemond's head embalmed and sent to Al-Mustarshid, the Abbasid Caliph.|$|E
5|$|During his term, Marshall focused {{primarily}} on advancing the progressive agenda. He successfully advocated {{the passage of a}} child labor law and anti-corruption legislation. He supported popular election of U.S. Senators, and the constitutional amendment to allow it was ratified by the Indiana General Assembly during his term. He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> the government millions of dollars. He was unsuccessful in passing the rest of the progressive platform agenda items or persuading the legislature to call a convention to rewrite the state constitution to expand the government's regulatory powers.|$|E

5|$|Following the Falklands war, British Aerospace {{explored}} the Skyhook, {{a new technique}} to operate Harriers from smaller ships. Skyhook would have allowed the launching and landing of Harriers from smaller ships by holding the aircraft in midair by a crane; secondary cranes were to hold weapons for rapid re-arming. This would potentially <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> fuel and allowed for operations in rougher seas. The system was marketed to foreign customers, and it was speculated that Skyhook {{could be applied to}} large submarines such as the Russian , but the system attracted no interest.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Braathens SAFE {{placed an}} order for three Boeing 737-200s, costing a total ofNOK100 million. They were {{intended}} to do the main haul of the charter market. There had been an internal struggle {{as to whether the}} company should purchase the Fokker F-28 Fellowship or the Boeing 737-100, a shorter version of the 737-200. Having a single plane type would give a single pool of pilot and mechanic certifications, and would <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> the company NOK millions in costs. Following the decision to purchase the F-28, Bjørn G. Braathen, son of Ludvig G. and later CEO, left the company.|$|E

The film cost $46 million to produce and encountered many problems during production, including a typhoon {{and the death of}} a cast member.

5|$|Saint Paul's Department of Planning and Economic Development divides Saint Paul into {{seventeen}} Planning Districts, {{created in}} 1979 to allow neighborhoods {{to participate in}} governance and use Community Development Block Grants. With a funding agreement directly from the city, the councils share a pool of funds. The councils have significant land-use control, a voice in guiding development, and they organize residents. The boundaries are adjusted depending on population changes; as such, they sometimes overlap established neighborhoods. Though these neighborhoods changed overtime, preservationists <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> many of their historically significant structures.|$|E
5|$|Schafer noted at {{the time}} of Grim Fandango {{original}} development, retention of code was not as rigorous as present day standards, and in some cases, Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may <b>have</b> <b>saved.</b> In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.|$|E
5|$|Though tornadoes {{can strike}} in an instant, there are {{precautions}} and preventative measures {{that people can}} take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> thousands of lives.|$|E
