From the academic year 2005/2006 onwards, access rules have enforced minimum grades of 95 (out of 200) in the national access examinations for all candidates in every sector of public higher education. In practical terms, and unlike what happened in the past, the new rule meant the exclusion {{of a large number of}} applicants who otherwise would have been admitted with negative grades to the less selective courses of some public institutions, and consequently lead to a number of available places for students left vacant every year in many courses.|$|E
2500|$|Nursing and <b>health</b> <b>technologies</b> {{technicians}} (technicians {{in clinical}} analysis, radiology, audiology, nuclear medicine and other technical fields in health) are also polytechnic higher education courses offered by nursing schools and schools of <b>health</b> <b>technologies</b> which are grouped into polytechnic institutes, and, in some cases, into universities (remaining {{in each of}} those situations as autonomous schools belonging to the polytechnic subsector). The nursing schools were legally defined as comparable to polytechnic institutions in 1988 (Administrative Rule 480/88 of 23 December 1988 - Decreto Lei n.º 480/88, de 23 de Dezembro), and started to provide higher education degrees in nursing in 1990 (Rule 821/89 of 15 September 1990 - Portaria n.º 821/89, de 15 de Setembro). Before 1990 nursing schools were not academic-degree-conferring institutions, and did not belong to the higher educational system. In 1995 they were fully integrated into the polytechnic subsystem (Administrative Rule 205/95 of 5 August 1995 - Decreto Lei n.º 205/95, de 5 de Agosto), and in 1999 [...] the new courses in nursing were approved, conferring a licenciatura diploma (Administrative Rule 353/99 of 8 September 1999 - Decreto Lei n.º 353/99, de 8 de Setembro).|$|E

40|$|<b>Health</b> <b>technology</b> {{assessments}} are a fundamental component of most developed health systems globally. Since their initial application, their purpose, methods, and application have advanced.

Consequently, as technologies rapidly develop and health budgets come under increasing pressure, <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> {{assessments are}} demanded by all stakeholders.

The Centre for Health Technology Evaluation recommends medicines and evaluates the safety and efficacy of procedures within the National Health Service. The Centre for Clinical Practice develops evidence-based clinical guidelines for clinicians on the appropriate treatment of people with specific diseases. NICE and the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) cooperate in risk assessment of new technology, monitoring safety incidents associated with procedures, and providing solutions if adverse outcomes are reported. In addition, NICE and NPSA share reporting in areas known as [...] "Confidential Enquiries": maternal or infant deaths, childhood deaths to age 16, deaths in persons with mental illness, and perioperative and unexpected medical deaths.|$|E

40|$|Background: Healthcare providers, {{managers}} and policy-makers in many jurisdictions {{are focused on}} a common goal: optimizing value and quality of care provided to their citizens within a resource envelope. <b>Health</b> <b>technology</b> reassessment is a structured, evidence-based assessment of the clinical, social, ethical and economic effects of a technology currently used in the healthcare system to inform optimal use of that technology in comparison with its alternatives. There are, however, few practical experiences with <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> reassessment and, as such, a nascent theoretical and methodological base. <b>Health</b> <b>technology</b> reassessment is a key strategy to achieve optimal healthcare resource utilization, and establishing a model for <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> reassessment is a required methodological step. Methods and results: The {{purpose of this article}} is to answer three formative questions: (1) What is <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> reassessment? (2) When should a <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> reassessment be implemented? (3) What is the role of <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> reassessment in evidence-informed health policy? Finally, we propose a conceptual framework for <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> reassessment, which others can modify, adapt, or adopt in their own context. The model consists of three broad phases and six iterative stages: (1) identification, (2) prioritization, (3) evidence synthesis, (4) determine policy/practice recommendation, (5) policy/practice implementation and (6) monitoring and evaluation. Two foundational components (meaningful stakeholder engagement and ongoing knowledge exchange and utilization) are represented across all stages. Conclusion: This description of <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> reassessment and the proposed model can be used by healthcare policy-makers and researchers to advance the field of technology management, with the goal of achieving optimal use throughout a technology’s lifecycle...|$|R

40|$|Italy {{is dealing}} with {{an early stage of}} <b>Health</b> <b>Technology</b> Assessment diffusion. In our opinion, {{there are at least three}} {{important}} dimensions related to <b>Health</b> <b>Technology</b> Assessment (strategy, inter-organisational relationships and governance) that are able to affect it, at each level, systemic and operating-unit related. Although <b>Health</b> <b>Technology</b> Assessment may have originated as a centralised function conducted by federal government agencies or other national/regional organisations, it is an increasingly decentralised activity. In Italy this decentralisation process is now reaching a peak because of the almost total assignment of health responsibilities to regional authorities. Moreover, <b>Health</b> <b>Technology</b> Assessment is interdisciplinary and it is interdependent with innovation processes. The context seems to be very complex: in our opinion a flexible approach is advisable.

40|$|The Brazilian Ministry of Health has {{institutionalized}} two articulated {{processes in}} the field of <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> management: (i) the production, systematization and dissemination of <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> assessment, and (ii) the adoption of a flow for the incorporation, exclusion or alteration of new technologies by the Brazilian National Health System. Several advances have been made, such as standardization of methods; production and promotion of studies; institutional development and international cooperation in the area of <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> assessment; definition of the necessary requirements for the presentation of proposals; definition of deadlines; and expansion of the segments that compose the committee that is responsible for the analysis and recommendation. However, some difficulties remain: <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> assessment activities concentrated in the Ministry; low sustainability of the activities of production and dissemination of the assessments; low penetration of <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> assessment in <b>health</b> care institutions; activities of assessment/incorporation with low participation of users; non-transparent decision-making processes; and low integration of the health policy with the scientific and technological policy...|$|R
40|$|Objective: <b>Health</b> <b>Technology</b> Assessment (HTA) aims at informing {{healthcare}} policymakers, {{managers and}} {{practitioners of the}} "clinical consequences, but also the economic, ethical, and other social implications of the diffusion and use of a specific procedure or technique on medical practice". So considering the policy-oriented nature of HTA that calls for a close integration into the functioning and governance of health systems the present study focuses on executive processes and function of the HTA office of Iran. Materials and methods: Data of this review study were collected through documented sources and observations from 2007 to 2010. Results: <b>Health</b> <b>Technology</b> Assessment began its activities as a secretariat in the Deputy of Health in 2007 and it continues as a <b>Health</b> <b>Technology</b> Assessment Office at the Management of <b>Health</b> <b>Technology</b> Assessment, Standardization, and Tariff at the Deputy of curative affairs of MOHME {{in the beginning of}} 2010. 14 Technology of modern medical equipment and 8 pharmaceutical medicine are assessed, Now many of measures for HTA establishment such as cooperation National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), Holding scientific committee meetings, Establishing the Masters degree of <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> assessment,Building capacities for <b>health</b> <b>technology</b> assessment through education in major universities of the country.
