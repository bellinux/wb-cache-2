25|$|Hostility between sub-groups {{under the}} same {{religious}} umbrella also became apparent in the 1980s. In October 1989, for instance, a Hindu sect called the Shiv Mandir burnt an effigy of Ravana, a Hindu mythological king, during a religious festival. This caused outrage among Tamil Hindus, who wanted to retaliate by staging a protest demonstration and threatened to retaliate by burning the effigy of Lord Ramachandra. Intra-religious tensions among Christian groups surfaced after the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>pamphlets</b> and booklets denigrating the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope by some Protestants.|$|E
25|$|On 14 March 1939, the Slovak Diet {{declared}} independence under direct Hitler {{pressure and}} a proclaimed threat of Hungarian attack against Slovakia. Destruction of the plurality political system caused a fast decline of minority rights (the German minority preserved a privileged position). Tense relationships between Slovakia and Hungary after the Vienna Award were worsened by a Hungarian attack against Slovakia in March 1939. This aggression combined with violent {{incidents in the}} annexed territory caused large anti-Hungarian social mobilization and discrimination. Some of the persecutions were motivated by the reciprocity principle included in the constitution, but persecutions were caused also by Hungarian propaganda demanding occupation of Slovakia, <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>pamphlets</b> and other propagandist material, oral propaganda and other provocations. Intensive propaganda was used {{on both sides and}} led to several anti-Hungarian demonstrations. The harshest repressions included internment in the camp in Ilava and deportations of dozens of Hungarians to Hungary. In June 1940, Slovakia and Hungary reached agreement and stopped deportations of their minorities.|$|E

50|$|A former bank clerk, in 1847 {{he became}} a partner in Reuter and Stargardt, a Berlin book-publishing firm. The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> radical <b>pamphlets</b> by the firm at the {{beginning}} of the 1848 Revolution may have focused official scrutiny on Reuter. Later that year, he left for Paris and worked in Charles-Louis Havas' news agency, the future Agence France Presse.|$|R
25|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, many major cases {{involving}} the Free Exercise Clause {{were related to}} Jehovah's Witnesses. Many communities directed laws against the Witnesses and their preaching work. From 1938 to 1955, the organization was involved in over forty cases before the Supreme Court, winning a majority of them. The first important victory came in 1938, when in Lovell v. City of Griffin, the Supreme Court held that cities could not require permits for the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>pamphlets.</b> In 1939, the Supreme Court decided Schneider v. Town of Irvington, in which it struck down anti-littering laws that were enforced only against Jehovah's Witnesses who were handing out pamphlets. In 1940, the Court considered Cantwell v. Connecticut; the plaintiff, a Jehovah's Witness, was charged with soliciting donations without a certificate from the Public Welfare Council. The Council was to grant the certificate only if the organization requesting it was a charity or sponsored a religious cause. The Supreme Court ruled that any law granting a public body the function of determining if a cause is religious or not violates the First Amendment.|$|E
500|$|After {{the split}} from the Centre Party, the {{ideology}} of the Centre Democrats was broadly similar to that of its originator, although the Centre Party became increasingly radical in the following years. The Centre Democrats did not publish a party or electoral manifesto before 1989, and until then its policies were known primarily through the small-scale <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>pamphlets,</b> which were almost exact copies of old Centre Party pamphlets. Like the Centre Party, the Centre Democrats claimed to be at the centre of the political spectrum, representing a [...] "centre-democratic ideology". Nevertheless, the party focused mainly on the issue of immigration, and mainstream observers considered the party's ideology to be a populist form of nationalism.|$|E

Residents are thought not to be an important target when constituency-level activities are carried out, as it is believed that regularly held neighbourhood gatherings have already helped to create the friendly and neighbourly environment through which the campaign messages and values are disseminated.|$|E

50|$|Antisemitica designates, in {{the fields}} of book collecting, and rare book dealing, the {{collection}} and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> books, <b>pamphlets,</b> serials, posters, and other printed literature, of an antisemitic nature. It is to be noted that antisemitica does not, generally, designate antisemitic activity, or antisemites themselves. In the United States, the freedom of the press does not limit the publication or <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> antisemitic literature, and there are scholarly and historical interests in such material.|$|R

50|$|The non-co-operation {{movement}} {{started in}} August, 1920, and spread {{rapidly in the}} district. A campaign was launched in the district for using indigenous goods, especially Khadi. The people were exhorted to leave government services, boycott the courts, and even children were asked {{not to go to}} English and government schools. The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pamphlets</b> Bundelkhand Keshri and Pukar in the district marked a turning point as they created a revolutionary stir among the masses.|$|R

50|$|As {{the attacks}} upon the queen grew ever more vicious, the {{popularity}} of the monarchy plummeted. Inside the Court at Versailles, jealousies and xenophobia were the principal causes of resentment and anger toward Marie Antoinette. Her unpopularity with certain powerful members of the Court, including the Duke of Orléans, led to the printing and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> scurrilous <b>pamphlets</b> which accused her of a range of sexual depravities as well as of spending the country into financial ruin. While it is now generally agreed that the queen's actions did little to provoke such animosity, the damage these pamphlets inflicted upon the monarchy proved to be a catalyst for the upheaval to come.|$|R
