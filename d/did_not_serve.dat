He formally began his term as Senator the next day. His time as an MLA was so short he did not sign the rolls in the Alberta Legislature and was never sworn in.|$|E

5|$|Later {{installations}} {{faced the}} opposite dilemma of having too few stations: one Streetsblog writer {{noted that the}} stations in the expansions were spaced further apart than the stations in the original service area, which would make the Citi Bike stations in these areas harder to access. In September 2017, a reporter for Time Out magazine wrote that the system <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> the outer boroughs adequately, with stations only located in wealthier areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens that were closer to the Manhattan central business districts.|$|E

5|$|The {{music in}} The Wind Waker was {{composed}} by Kenta Nagata, Hajime Wakai, Toru Minegishi, and Koji Kondo. The sound team was significantly larger than for other contemporary projects to accommodate Nintendo's {{desire for a}} high caliber {{of work in the}} rushed development schedule. Koji Kondo, the primary composer for The Legend of Zelda series, contributed to the score but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> as sound director. However, the score incorporated some of his pieces from older Zelda games, modifying them to emphasize the time passed between the stories.|$|E
5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as {{a rejection of the}} Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> American interests, and he did not advocate membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E
5|$|During {{a game in}} 2013 {{between the}} Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Culbreth, acting as the crew chief for the game, made an {{incorrect}} call in the 7th inning, for which he later received a two-game suspension and a fine. Houston manager Bo Porter made a pitching change, and Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia called for a pinch-hitter. Porter attempted to make a second pitching change and Scioscia immediately contested it. After discussing the call with his umpiring crew, Culbreth allowed the pitching change, violating the MLB rule 3.05(b). He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> his suspension immediately, and he continued working regular games in the weeks following the incident.|$|E

In the United Kingdom, the album entered and peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart and was eventually certified platinum. Critical reception towards X was generally favourable, but many critics felt that it lacked introspection from Minogue's side. Later on, critics argued that the album <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> as a worthy comeback for Minogue.|$|E

Although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> in any significant actions Lipsett performed his duties well, in 1901 was promoted to captain and on his return to England in 1903 was recommended to the Staff College, Camberley. In 1905 he returned to South Africa as a staff officer (Deputy-Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster-General), {{to aid in the}} reconstitution of colonial government, a task he performed until 1907, when he was posted back to his regiment. Based at Aldershot, Lipsett conducted both regimental business and operated as an aide-de-camp to the commander of the 2nd Division, Theodore Edward Stephenson.|$|E
