40|$|The mission {{design for}} Cassini-Huygens {{calls for a}} {{four-year}} orbital survey of the Saturnian system and the descent into the Titan atmosphere and eventual soft-landing of the Huygens probe. The Cassini orbiter tour consists of 76 orbits around Saturn with 44 close Titan flybys and 8 targeted icy satellite flybys. The Cassini orbiter spacecraft carries twelve scientific instruments that will perform {{a wide range of}} observations on a multitude of designated targets. The science opportunities, frequency of encounters, the length of the Tour, and the use of distributed operations pose significant challenges for developing the <b>science</b> <b>plan</b> for the orbiter mission. The Cassini <b>Science</b> <b>Planning</b> Process is the process used to develop and integrate the <b>science</b> and engineering <b>plan</b> that incorporates an acceptable level of science required to meet the primary mission objectives far the orbiter. The bulk of the integrated <b>science</b> and engineering <b>plan</b> will be developed prior to Saturn Orbit Insertion (Sol). The <b>Science</b> <b>Planning</b> Process consists of three elements: 1) the creation of the Tour Atlas, which identifies the science opportunities in the tour, 2) the development of the <b>Science</b> Operations <b>Plan</b> (SOP), which is the conflict-free timeline of all science observations and engineering activities, a constraint-checked spacecraft pointing profile, and data volume allocations to the science instruments, and 3) an Aftermarket and SOP Update process, which is used to update the SOP while in tour with the latest information on spacecraft performance, science opportunities, and ephemerides. This paper will discuss the various elements of the <b>Science</b> <b>Planning</b> Process used on the Cassini Mission to integrate, implement, and adapt the science and engineering activity plans for Tour...|$|R

40|$|The Dawn Mission to {{the main}} belt asteroids (4) Vesta and (1) Ceres {{presents}} unique challenges for <b>science</b> <b>planning</b> and operations. The uncertainties of achieving orbit around a substantial body with an unknown gravity field limit {{the ability of the}} mission designers to predict in advance the timing of geometric events and orbit parameters. Therefore the <b>science</b> <b>plan</b> architecture had to be robust to a large range of planning uncertainties. However, the complexity of instrument interactions {{with each other and with}} the spacecraft required that the <b>science</b> <b>plan</b> and instrument sequences be developed a year in advance of Vesta arrival. Because the <b>science</b> sequence <b>planning</b> and execution timeline did not allow for significant adjustments of the sequences prior to execution, and because the operations time at the asteroids was quite limited, the <b>science</b> <b>plan</b> was designed to be functionally redundant. Functional redundancy was intended to provide multiple observations of the same surface under different conditions. Observing in this manner was intended to protect against potential data losses while providing complementary datasets in the event that all data are successfully acquired. The Dawn spacecraft was captured into orbit around Vesta in July 2011 and will complete Vesta science operations in the summer of 2012. During the approach and early science operations phases there were multiple, unrelated incidents resulting in instrument datasets that were partially lost or degraded. Careful accounting of the datasets returned to date clearly illustrates how the data losses were successfully offset by the redundancy in the observation plan. One specific success is the framing camera stereo imaging from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit, which is needed to generate the topography map. This paper describes the results of the execution of the <b>science</b> operations <b>plan</b> and how that compared to the assumptions that informed the development of the plan...|$|R

40|$|Planetary <b>Sciences</b> <b>planning</b> {{activities}} are often driven by spacecraft technical constraints, such as thermal limitations, link budgets or pointing limitations.

In order to improve the <b>science</b> <b>planning</b> for planetary missions a prototype of a <b>Science</b> Observation <b>Planning</b> Tool was developed were the focus is put more on the optimization of science goals. This tool allows for parametric analysis of science quantities, together with the most important technical constraints, in order to optimize the observation plan.

40|$|The {{numerous}} scientific {{achievements of}} BALTEX Phase I called for application {{in other areas}} where knowledge on and modelling capa-bilities of the energy and water cycles in the cli-mate system are fundamental. A <b>Science</b> <b>Plan</b> for BALTEX Phase II covering the years 2003 to 2012 has therefore been published in early 2004 which suggests to enlarge the scientific scope of the programme and strives to contribute to estab-lishing not only physical but also environmental policy- and stakeholder-relevant information.
