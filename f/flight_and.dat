5|$|Because {{pterosaur}} anatomy {{has been}} so heavily modified for <b>flight,</b> <b>and</b> immediate transitional fossil predecessors have not so far been described, the ancestry of pterosaurs is not fully understood.

5|$|Black-shouldered kites form monogamous pairs, {{breeding}} between August and January.

5|$|Dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying {{insects that}} hold their wings {{horizontally}} both in <b>flight</b> <b>and</b> at rest.
