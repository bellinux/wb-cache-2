The FE models of finish rolling process with a front edge roll were built, and influences of the <b>edge</b> <b>rolling</b> reduction on the stress change in the plate <b>edge</b> during finish <b>rolling</b> were analyzed.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is about a}} costly problem in the automotive industry due to tool fracture during the splines cold rolling of steel shafts. The objective is to study {{the cause of this}} failure and propose solutions that can be implemented in the workshop. The writing starts with a brief introduction of the companies involved in shafts production and problem solving. It introduces the cold rolling process and its advantages on splines manufacturing, and it goes through relevant material and process characteristics that help to determine the cause of tool fracture. In order to understand the process failure and production flow, it has been necessary to build up an Ishikawa diagram with possible tool fracture causes. After collecting and analysing the data about the machine <b>tool,</b> cold <b>rolling</b> process and work-piece and <b>rolling</b> <b>tool</b> materials, tests and experiments have been done. It has been considered that there is a <b>rolling</b> <b>tool</b> fatigue that causes tool fracture. Beside tool fracture, two more problems with production flow instability and the right side <b>rolling</b> <b>tool</b> have been detected. Testing the material hardness of the work-piece has shown continuous hardness fluctuations from the supplier. Rolling tool misalignment has been measured by using a vernier caliper measurement device. Rolling tools material hardness analysis shows that tool is very hard and it is possible to use a tougher material which responds better to cyclic loads. Leax has tried to solve the problem by testing another lubrication and tool coatings. A modal analysis test has been performed in order to find the natural frequency of the work-piece which possibly may lead to vibration and over loading one of the <b>rolling</b> <b>tools.</b> The conclusion that has been reached is that main cause of fracture is <b>rolling</b> <b>tool</b> fatigue due to cyclic loads and it is important to use other <b>rolling</b> <b>tool</b> material. The other two detected problems, production flow instability and rigth side <b>rolling</b> <b>tool</b> fracture, should be considered {{as a part of the}} problem in order to significantly increase tools life and stabilize production flow rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of the rolling force applied to the workpiece (1) by <b>rolling</b> <b>tools</b> (9, 10), at least during an initial plunge phase, is controlled dependent on the difference of the contact lengths between the workpiece and respectively the <b>rolling</b> <b>tools</b> (9) and (10). As a result, the workpiece is periodically subjected to a rolling force {{in such a way}} that the maximum and minimum of this force correspond to the zero and maximum difference of the contact lengths.

40|$|Thanks {{to their}} high wear resistance, ceramic {{materials}} {{are suitable for}} use as metal working <b>tools</b> for <b>rolling</b> processes. The materials that {{have been widely used}} for <b>rolling</b> <b>tools</b> are steel or tungsten carbide. In order to get higher wear resistances and therefore longer lifetimes of the <b>rolling</b> <b>tools,</b> ceramic materials may be used. Silicon nitride is a highly wear resistant ceramic material. Further advantages of this silicon nitride are its high temperature stability, its low adhesion to the metallic materials and its low specific weight. Silicon nitride is therefore ideally suited for <b>rolling</b> <b>tools.</b> The higher costs of the rolls have to be compensated by the longer lifetime at more stable production conditions. In addition, the consumption cooling lubricants can be reduced by using ceramic tools. The scope of the project is therefore the development and fabrication of ceramic rolls for different semi-manufactured products. It is found that the use of ceramic tools is possible and even has advantages regarding service lifetime and product quality. The present paper presents some case studies of ceramic <b>rolling</b> <b>tools</b> that were developed and tested in different manufacturing processes. The work conducted includes tool design, materials development, fabrication of the rolls, mechanical and tribological testing, and the testing of the rolls in several production processes. The focus of the presentation is put on the evaluation of ceramic tools and other components in rolling applications...|$|R
40|$|Failure {{mechanisms}} of silicon nitride wire <b>rolling</b> <b>tools</b> used in forming high strength steels were investigated. Wire rolling experiments and FEM {{were carried out}} to analyze the thermomechanical loading in this metalforming process. Based on the experimental observations and numerical computations, a model was proposed to describe the failure mechanisms in work rolls. Thermal stresses were found to comprise a minuscule portion of the overall thermomechanical stresses developed in the rolls. Surface wear played a fundamental and decisive role in the damage evolution and lifetime of the <b>rolling</b> <b>tools.</b> Tensile stress, which is relevant to the fracture of Si 3 N 4, exhibited a peak on the caliber flanks. Both the value and location of this peak {{were found to be}} dependent on wire reduction. Furthermore, failure of Si 3 N 4 rolls under rolling-contact fatigue was investigated by means of twin-disk experiments and FEM. The results emphasized the impact of tribomechanical aspects on the failure of ceramic components. Such observations could be transferred to wire rolling to improve the reliability of ceramic-based <b>rolling</b> <b>tools...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{kinematics}} of {{the deep}} <b>rolling</b> <b>tool,</b> contact stress, and induced residual stress in the near-surface material of a flat Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy plate are numerically investigated. The deep <b>rolling</b> <b>tool</b> is under multiaxis nonlinear motion in the process. Unlike available deep rolling simulations in the open literature, the roller motion investigated in this study includes penetrative and slightly translational motions. A three-dimensional finite element model with dynamic explicit technique is developed to simulate the instantaneous complex roller motions during the deep rolling process. The initial motion of the rollers followed by the penetration motion to apply the load and perform the deep rolling process, the load releasing, and material recovery steps is sequentially simulated. This model is able to capture the transient characteristics of the kinematics on the roller and contacts between the roller and the plate due to variations of roller motion. The predictions show that the magnitude of roller reaction force in the penetration direction starts to decrease with time when the roller motion changes to the deep rolling step and the residual stress distributions in the near-surface material after the material recovery step varies considerably along the roller path...|$|R

This means that for the design of an accurate production process the deformation of the tools has to be accounted for. The shape rolling of symmetrical straight vanes has been investigated. This rolling process is considered stationary, because these vanes have a constant cross-section over the length. Therefore an ALE formulation is suitable to calculate the steady state. The deformation of the sheet as well as the deformation of the tools have been calculated with the developed finite element model. Some results of these simulations are presented in this paper.
