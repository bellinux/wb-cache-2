Fuhre said that there were occasions when Kingwood had no coverage because all of the firefighters were called to other locations, and still do.|$|E

60|$|However {{fascinating}} the subject, I do not {{propose to}} make a whole book about Eliphalet. Yet sidelights {{on the life of}} every great man are interesting. And there are a few incidents in his early career which <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>gotten</b> into the subscription biographical Encyclopaedias. In several of these volumes, to be sure, we may see steel engravings of him, true likenesses all. His was the type of face which is the glory of the steel engraving,--square and solid, as a corner-stone should be. The very clothes he wore were made for the steel engraving, stiff and wiry in texture, with sharp angles at the shoulders, and sombre in hue, as befit such grave creations.|$|E
60|$|About {{twenty-five years}} ago--along there somewhere--I {{suggested}} to Orion that he write an autobiography. I {{asked him to}} try to tell the straight truth in it; to refrain from exhibiting himself in creditable attitudes exclusively, and to honorably set down all the incidents of his life which he had found interesting to him, including those which were burned into his memory because he was ashamed of them. I said that this had never been done, and that if he could do it his autobiography would be a most valuable piece of literature. I said I was offering him a job which I could not duplicate in my own case, but I would cherish the hope that he might succeed with it. I recognise now that I was trying to saddle upon him an impossibility. I have been dictating this autobiography of mine daily for three months; I have thought of fifteen hundred or two thousand incidents in my life which I am ashamed of, but I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>gotten</b> one of them to consent to go on paper yet. I think that that stock will still be complete and unimpaired when I finish these memoirs, if I ever finish them. I believe that if I should put in all or any of those incidents I should be sure to strike them out when I came to revise this book.|$|E

Hader, on late-night TV interviews, said that this happens with such frequency because changes are often made to the script up until the live show, and frequently Hader doesn't see the final cue cards until the live broadcast. As a result, some of the more outrageous things that Stefon says are relatively or completely new to Hader.

5000|$|As is {{the case}} with many Juice Crew {{associated}} projects on the Cold Chillin' label, the production was handled by legendary beatmaker Marley Marl.

Marl has countered the artists claims by suggesting that the rappers had limited knowledge of production equipment, and would <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>gotten</b> the same signature [...] "boom bap" [...] sound that was unique to the producer.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the wealth}} the king {{declared}} September 5, 1529 that the courtier Hans Emmiksen by the monastery’s monks was elected, {{rather than its}} infirm abbot, as its custodian until his death, since “the monastery’s estate is daily won from it, and the brothers {{for a long time}} <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>gotten</b> their necessities according to their rule’s exercise”.Hans Emmiksen was at the same time named as vassal there by the king, who rather than the monks themselves probably prompted the election.
