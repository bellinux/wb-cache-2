5|$|In early 1971, Deacon was {{introduced}} to Taylor and May by a friend at a disco who told him {{that they were in}} a band that <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>lost</b> its bassist. A couple of days later he auditioned in a lecture room at Imperial College London and became the last member of Queen to join. Since the band's last bassist drew attention away from Mercury, Deacon was selected for his musical talent, his quiet demeanour and his electrical skills. A persistent legend claims Deacon was the seventh bassist auditioned, but more recent sources show Queen's bassists were, in order: Mike Grose, Barry Mitchell, Doug Bogie and Deacon. Deacon played his first show with Queen at the College of Estate Management in Kensington in June.|$|E
5|$|Hershey faced a {{challenging}} {{schedule for the}} end of its regular season, with only three of the last 14 games scheduled for home. This marked the fewest in team history, with a previous low of five games in the final 14 of 2002–03. The team also experienced significant roster changes in March, with Orlov, Oleksy and Schilling all being recalled to the Washington Capitals. Almeida and Kostenko were reassigned to the Reading Royals, Nicolas Deschamps joined the Bears roster, and Kevin Marshall was for defenseman Chay Genoway. Capitals winger Joey Crabb also cleared waivers and was assigned to Hershey on March 23. The Bears ended a two-game losing streak with a 4–1 victory over Worcester on March 24, but lost 5–3 on March 29 to Albany, who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>lost</b> six consecutive games. Grubauer was replaced by Sabourin after surrendering three shots on seven goals. Hershey defeated Providence 3–2 the next day, rallying with two goals in the final 12 minutes. It marked the first time this season the Bears had won a game after trailing for two periods.|$|E

5|$|Sweden <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>lost</b> {{one third}} of its population, as Russia had conquered the eastern part and created the Grand Duchy of Finland out of it during the Finnish War in 1808–1809. Shortly after, in 1814, the west flank had been secured by the {{personal}} union with Norway, and after the Napoleonic Wars, the former main enemy of Sweden in the south, Denmark, was no longer any threat. The only threat left was Russia, which now stood {{just across the border}} in the north, and had possession of the Åland Islands less than 150km from the Swedish capital Stockholm. The Swedish Navy was considered superior to the Russian in the Gulf of Bothnia, so a seaborne invasion against the coast of Norrland was not likely. And even though the Russians had invaded northern Sweden via Finland in the previous war, the general opinion was that in case of a new war, their main attack would be conducted towards Stockholm and southern Sweden.|$|E

Allan Border was confident the team would win the one day series and bring back the Trans-Tasman Trophy.|$|E

25|$|Encouraged to {{continue}} her career, McVie recorded a solo album, Christine Perfect; following her success {{as a member of}} Fleetwood Mac, the album was reissued under the name The Legendary Christine Perfect Album. After marrying Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie, she joined Fleetwood Mac in 1970. She had already contributed backup vocals and painted the cover for Kiln House. The band <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>lost</b> founding member Peter Green, and its members were nervous about touring without him. McVie had been a huge fan of the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac; and since she knew all the lyrics to their songs, she went along.|$|E

During his term, he faced many {{political}} challenges, {{due to the}} fact that the main opposing party, New Progressive Party (NPP) gained control of the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico, the Resident Commissioner in Congress (Luis Fortuño), and Acevedo Vilá's main political rival, Pedro Rosselló (former Governor or Puerto Rico who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>lost</b> the election against Acevedo), managed to gain a seat in the Senate of Puerto Rico after a young first-term Senator from Arecibo unexpectedly resigned shortly after taking the oath of office, and unsuccessfully attempted to topple Senate President Kenneth McClintock.|$|E
25|$|That night Curtin {{received}} a call from MacArthur, who had just heard about Eather's withdrawal to Imita Ridge. MacArthur told Curtin to send Blamey back to Papua to take personal command of New Guinea Force. Curtin did so, and Blamey arrived in Port Moresby on 23 September. This put Rowell and Blamey on a collision course. They had a history of animosity going back to earlier in the war, first in the Middle East then in Greece. Rowell felt that Blamey should have supported him and stood up to Curtin and MacArthur. Relations were fractious, and on 28 September Rowell had had enough. He spoke his mind to his commanding officer, and was dismissed. Potts <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>lost</b> his major advocate in Papua.|$|E
25|$|Nichols {{began his}} career at Gloucestershire, taking just three wickets {{as part of a}} bowling attack {{dominated}} by W. G. Grace. His five first-class matches for the county came over three seasons and in 1886 he moved to bordering Somerset. Somerset <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>lost</b> their first-class status, having failed to arrange a sufficient number of matches against other first-class counties in 1885. Having customarily batted as part of the tail for Gloucestershire, Nichols opened the batting alongside fellow professional Albert Clapp on his first recorded appearance for Somerset in July 1886. A highlight for Nichols during these early years at Somerset was his 6/30 during the 1887 match against Hampshire. Typifying his bowling, he bowled 32.2 overs, of which 24 were maidens.|$|E

25|$|A new Latina group, called Soluna, <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>lost</b> {{a member}} {{and was looking}} for a replacement. T Lopez quickly auditioned, and was whisked away on tour. T Lopez {{explained}} that touring with Marc Anthony and Enrique Iglesias was a crazy roller coaster ride for her because everything happened so fast. But she had a great time, T Lopez said. Latina group Soluna released their 2002 debut album, For All Time, under the Dreamworks Records label. Paramount and UPN quickly took interest in the group and developed a TV pilot based on their lives, co-starring Mario Lopez & Tony Plana. After filming the pilot, Soluna reconvened for a second album but realized they had grown apart musically. The group said that they wanted it to work so bad that they were forcing it and they finally just gave up and wished each other well in their individual journeys.|$|E
25|$|About {{six months}} after his {{retirement}} from the Compagnie des Etablissements Eiffel, Eiffel was approached by Felix-Max Richard, owner of the Comptoir General de Photographie. Felix-Max Richard <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>lost</b> a lawsuit against him by his brother to enforce a noncompetition agreement. Felix-Max Richard appealed the decision but felt he needed a back-up plan if his appeal was denied. On May 28, 1895, the court denied the appeal and Gustave Eiffel bought the Comptoir with three other men: Joseph Vallot, Alfred Besnier, and Leon Gaumont, who was thirty years his junior. The company was renamed L. Gaumont et Cie after its youngest partner because Eiffel did not want {{his name on the}} company. Leon Gaumont was manager and Eiffel was president from 1895 through 1906. The company went public in January 1907 {{and is one of the}} oldest motion picture companies in the world.|$|E

In 54 BC, her great uncle Caesar is said to have been anxious for her to divorce her husband so that she could marry Pompey who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>lost</b> his wife Julia (Julius Caesar's daughter, and thus Octavia's cousin once removed). The couple did not want to get a divorce so instead Pompey declined the proposal and married Cornelia Metella. So Octavia's husband continued to oppose Julius Caesar including in the crucial year of his consulship 50 BC. Civil war broke out when Caesar in Gaul invaded Italy in 49 BC.|$|E
