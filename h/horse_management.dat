500|$|On 23 April 1911 {{the sun set}} for the {{duration}} of the winter months, and the party settled into the Cape Evans hut. Under Scott's naval regime the hut was divided by a wall made of packing cases, so that officers and men lived largely separate existences, scientists being deemed [...] "officers" [...] for this purpose. Everybody was kept busy; scientific work continued, observations and measurements were taken, equipment was overhauled and adapted for future journeys. The surviving ponies needed daily exercise, and the dogs required regular attention. Scott spent much time calculating sledging rations and weights for the forthcoming polar march. The routine included regular lectures on a wide range of subjects: Ponting on Japan, Wilson on sketching, Oates on <b>horse</b> <b>management</b> and geologist Frank Debenham on volcanoes. To ensure that physical fitness was maintained there were frequent games of football in the half-light outside the hut; Scott recorded that [...] "Atkinson is by far the best player, but Hooper, P.O. Evans and Crean are also quite good." [...] The South Polar Times, which had been produced by Shackleton during the Discovery expedition, was resurrected under Cherry-Garrard's editorship. On [...] a feast was arranged, to mark Scott's 43rd birthday; a second celebration on [...] marked Midwinter Day, the day that marks the midpoint of the long polar night.|$|E

[...] Many <b>horse</b> <b>management</b> handbooks recommend grooming a horse daily, though {{for the average}} modern horse owner, {{this is not always}} possible. [...] However, a horse should always be groomed before being ridden to avoid chafing and rubbing of dirt and other material, which can cause sores on the animal and also grind dirt into horse tack. Grooming also allows the horse handler to check for injuries and {{is a good way to}} gain the trust of the animal.|$|E

2500|$|Over vast areas, {{barbed wire}} {{is often seen}} {{in some parts of}} the world, but it is the most {{dangerous}} fencing material that can be used around horses, even in a large pasture. [...] If a horse is caught in barbed wire, it can quickly become severely hurt, often leaving lasting scars or even permanent injuries. [...] <b>Horse</b> <b>management</b> books and periodicals are nearly universal in stating that barbed wire should never be used to contain horses. [...] However, this advice is widely ignored, particularly in the western United States.|$|E
2500|$|Competitive trail riding, a pace race held across terrain {{similar to}} {{endurance}} riding, but shorter in length (25 – , depending on class). Being {{a form of}} pace race, the objective is not to finish in the least time. Instead, as in other forms of judged trail riding, each competitor is graded on everything including physical condition, campsite and <b>horse</b> <b>management.</b> Horsemanship also is considered, including how the rider handles the trail and how horse is handled and presented to the judge and vet throughout the ride. The horse is graded on performance, manners, etc. [...] "Pulse and respiration" [...] stops check the horse's recovery ability. The judges also set up obstacles along the trail and the horse and rider are graded on how well they perform as a team. The whole point is the partnership between the horse and rider.|$|E

40|$|The small strongyles of horses, {{also known}} as cyathostomins, are {{considered}} the most prevalent and pathogenic parasites of horses today. The clinical syndrome of larval cyathostominosis which {{occurs as a result}} of mass emergence of inhibited stages has a high fatality rate despite the best standard of care given to affected <b>horses.</b> <b>Management</b> of the challenge level of cyathostomins to prevent the syndrome is preferable. Many different management programmes have been tried over the past two decades, with mixed success. Programmes have relied heavily on repeated use of anthelmintic treatments throughout the life of a horse. The widespread incidence of resistance to certain anthelmintics is reducing these options. An understanding of the biology of cyathostomins, risk factors for infection and appropriate strategic use of still effective anthelmintics is essential for the future management of this parasite group. This review highlights the necessity to use currently available anthelmintics that are appropriately suited to the biology of cyathostomins, and to maintain heir efficacy through an appropriate treatment strategy...|$|R
2500|$|In October 1968, the Interior {{department}} {{established an}} Advisory Committee {{to report on}} the state of the herd, the status of forage on the range, and whether feral horses should continue to be kept on the range. The panel met a month later, and commissioned studies on whether branded runaway horses should be allowed to mix with the herd, whether BLM should build artificial watering holes to encourage the animals to range more widely, whether BLM should manage the herd's bloodlines by introducing stallions to the herds, and how many horses should live on the range. At its February 1969 meeting, the committee proved sharply divided over <b>horse</b> <b>management</b> issues. Studies of the range proved highly inadequate. [...] BLM presented a study to the committee which attempted to show that horses were grazing the land so heavily that extensive erosion was taking place, but a private study found that the erosion was due to topography and drought and not because of the horses. Another study, conducted by a group which promoted hunting on the range, found that the horses were having a negative impact on edible plants in the Pryor Mountains and were having a detrimental impact on deer fawn survival. [...] But the committee discovered that this study hadn't even been conducted in the Pryor Mountains but at another location. Another BLM study concluded that the Pryor Mountains horses had changed from grazers to browsers and were consuming large mountain mahogany shrub, a critical deer food source. But an Advisory Committee analysis showed that the plants documented in the study were small mountain mahogany shrub variety, not the large mahogany shrub BLM claimed, and that the vegetation was in good shape, not deteriorated as the BLM claimed.|$|E

40|$|A {{transition}} to {{renewable energy sources}} and a circular economy has increased interest in renewable resources not usually considered as energy sources or plant nutrient resources. Horse manure exemplifies this, as it is sometimes recycled but not often used for energy purposes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore <b>horse</b> manure <b>management</b> in a Swedish municipality and prospects for energy recovery. The case study includes a survey of horse manure practices, environmental assessment of horse manure treatment in a biogas plant, including associated transport, compared to on-site unmanaged composting, and finally a simplified economic analysis. It was found that <b>horse</b> manure <b>management</b> was characterized by indoor collection of manure most of the year and storage on concrete slabs or in containers, followed by direct application on arable land. Softwood was predominantly used as bedding, and bedding accounted for a relatively small proportion (13 %) of the total mix. Anaerobic digestion was indicated to reduce potential environmental impact in comparison to unmanaged composting, mainly due to biogas substituting use of fossil fuels. The relative environmental impact from transport of manure from horse facilities to anaerobic digestion plant was small. Results also indicate a relatively high cost for horse keepers to change from composting on site to anaerobic digestion in a centralized plant...|$|R
