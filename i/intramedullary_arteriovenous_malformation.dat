40|$|Summary: We {{report a}} rare {{situation}} in which a lipo-myelomeningocele and an <b>intramedullary</b> <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> (AVM) occurred together at the T 11 –L 1 level in a 44 -year-old man. MR images showed a hyper-vascular lesion intradurally and a fatty component ex-tradurally. Spinal angiography revealed this lesion to be an intramedullary AVM with multiple feeding arteries from the right T 12 and left T 10 intercostal artery and the left L 1 lumbar artery, drained by tortuous, dilated, per-imedullary veins. Among the arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the spinal cord, an intramedullary mal-formation with the nidus of the fistula in the cord parenchyma is uncommon. Intramedullary AVMs are congenital abnormalities, and patients are gen...|$|E
40|$|During a 3 year period, 21 {{patients}} with spinal cord vascular malformations involving the {{anterior spinal artery}} were treated by embol ization through this artery. Of four cases of extramed-ullary arteriovenous fistula, two patients embolized {{at an early stage}} showed excellent results, whereas results were mediocre in two patients who were paraplegic at embolization. Of 17 cases of <b>intramedullary</b> <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> (AVM), nine pa-tients showed clinical improvement either with or without radio-logic evidence of residual malformation; three patients had com-plications that led to clinical worsening; in the other five patients, results were mixed or inconclusive. Angiomyelotomography is recommended to diagnose extramedullary arteriovenous fistulae involving the anterior spinal artery. Pretherapeutic evaluation of intramedullary AVMs must consider the spinal cord level at which the malformation occurs. Angiotomography and temporary oc-clusion tests permit identification of collateral anastomoses be-fore embolization. Respective criteria for surgery and emboliza-tion are defined. In cases where embolization is indicated, short-term results can generally be predicted. Spinal cord vascular malformations fed by the anterior spinal artery are of two types: extramedu llary arteriovenous fistulae with anterior spinal artery part ic ipat ion. which are usually located around the conus terminalis and comprise a direct shunt between the anterior spinal artery and the medullary vein; and intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which are usually multipe-diculated but always involve the anterior spinal artery. Embolization via the anterior spinal artery has always been regarded as a dan-gerous procedure because serious neurologic defic its result from its occ lusion. However. recent advances in neuroradiologic tech-nology have allowed us to embolize 21 cases of spinal cord AVM through this artery. Among the new techniques, ang iotomography and angiomyelography playa major role in mapping these malfor-mation s in order to identify and minimize potential risks in treatment. Innovations involving the use of coaxial catheters and temporary occlusion and detachable balloons have also helped to make em-boliza tion a sa fer procedure [1]...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUNDAND PURPOSE: The {{diagnosis}} of spinal vascular malformations may be challenging on conventional MR imaging because neither {{the location of}} the signal abnormality in the spinal cord nor the level of the abnormal flow voids correlates with the level of the fistula. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of the utility of using a time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics sequence in the diagnosis, characterization, and localization of spinal vascular malformations, comparing it with the criterion standard of spinal DSA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five consecutive patients with a suspected {{diagnosis of}} spinal vascular malformation underwent time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics followed by spinal DSA. All scans were performed on a 1. 5 T scanner by using a standard 8 -channel spine coil and were reported by a neuroradiologist before the DSA was performed. RESULTS: Forty-seven lesions were confirmed on time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics and classified as spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (n 33, with 1 patient having a type Ib fistula), perimedullary spinal cord arteriovenous fistulas (n 10), and <b>intramedullary</b> <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> (n 3). One patient had an extradural spinal vascular malformation. Time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics identified {{the location of the}} arterial feeder to within 1 vertebral level in 27 / 33 patients (81. 8 %) with spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas and correctly predicted the side in 22 / 33 (66. 6 %) patients. Perimedullary spinal cord arteriovenous fistulas were erroneously considered to represent spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas before spinal DSA. The anatomy of the arterial supply to <b>intramedullary</b> <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> was also poorly characterized on time-resolved contrast-enhanced MR angiography...|$|R
40|$|Spinal AVM {{are very}} rare {{vascular}} lesions and most o the studies give reports on {{only a few}} cases. Given their localization between the spinal tracts and the gray matter core of the medulla and their multiple feeders from posterior and anterior spinal arteries they are amongst the most difficult surgical pathology in the nervous sistem. We present {{the case of a}} 60 years old male with a glomus type T 10 -L 2 spinal AVM that presented with motor deficit in the lower limbs and urinary incontinence. The partially thrombosed lesion was completely resected without previous embolisation, and the patient was walking with assistance at discharge.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} magnetic resonance (MR) angiography {{in the assessment of}} spinal vascular malformation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with spinal vascular <b>malformations</b> (30 dural <b>arteriovenous</b> fistulas, two perimedullary arteriovenous fistulas, and two <b>intramedullary</b> <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations)</b> underwent MR angiography and MR imaging before and after endovascular or surgical treatment. RESULTS: MR angiography showed residual flow in perimedullary vessels in seven patients with dural fistula after embolization with liquid adhesive. In all seven, treatment failure was confirmed with arteriography. Long-lasting disappearance of flow in perimedullary vessels was demonstrated at MR angiography in 22 patients with dural fistula. MR imaging demonstrated normalization of spinal cord volume in 16 of 22 patients and signal intensity on T 2 -weighted images in three patients. Disappearance of cord enhancement was observed in five of 21 patients and of perimedullary enhanced vessels in six of 13 patients. In one additional patient with dural fistula treated with embolization, early posttreatment MR angiography showed disappearance of flow in perimedullary vessels, which reappeared at follow-up and was consistent with reopening of a small residual fistula. Posttreatment MR angiography demonstrated transient reduction of flow in the nidus in two patients with intramedullary malformations treated with embolization. Permanent disappearance of flow in the perimedullary vessel was seen after endovascular treatment in two patients with perimedullary fistula. CONCLUSION: MR angiography is more sensitive than MR imaging in depicting residual or recurrent flow in peri- or intramedullary vessels, which indicates patency of the vascular malformation...|$|R
40|$|Summary: We {{describe}} a cervical congenital paraspinal ar-teriovenous malformation (AVM) drained by paraspinal and epidural ectatic veins, which caused massive {{erosion of the}} C 6 and C 7 vertebral bodies, threatening the cervical stability and necessitating treatment. During the first ses-sion, six arterial embolizations were performed {{to reduce the size}} and the flow of the AVM. Two months later, a venous approach was used to occlude the remnant venous exit of the AVM and achieve a complete cure. All embolizations were performed using N-butylcyanoacrylate. Spinal vascular malformations can be classified {{on the basis of their}} location and angioarchitecture (1, 2) : <b>intramedullary</b> <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> (AVMs), intradural AVFs, dural AVFs, epidural AVFs and AVMs, paravertebral AVFs and AVMs, intraosseous vertebral AVMs, and Cobb syndrome. Paravertebral malformations are rare, but the cer-vical location is reported to be the most common (3). In most of the cases, paravertebral malforma-tions are congenital (3). We report a congenital cer-vical paravertebral AVM consisting of several AVFs associated with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome of the left arm. The lesion drained into multiple ectatic veins, some of which were inside the spinal canal, causing C 5 and C 6 vertebral body erosion and shifting of the spinal cord. Case Report In 1997, a 48 -year-old woman with a congenital Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome of the left arm with cutaneous and sub-cutaneous angiodysplasia of the left hemithorax associated with a paravertebral cervical AVM was referred to our insti-tution. The appearance was in keeping with a metameric vas-cular malformation. No neurologic deficit was ever noted. the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome was diagnosed at birth. The par-aspinal AVM was angiographically documented in 1990 after a thrill was palpated in the neck. Treatment was not proposed to the patient at that time. In December 1996, plain X-rays of the cervical spine showed progressive erosion of C 6 and C...|$|R

40|$|Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is characterised by the {{development}} of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> -enlarged shunts allowing arterial flow to bypass capillaries and enter directly into veins. HHT is caused by mutations in ALK 1 or Endoglin; however, the majority of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> are idiopathic and arise spontaneously. Idiopathic <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> differ from those due to loss of ALK 1 both in terms of location and disease progression. Furthermore, while <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> in HHT and Alk 1 knockout models have decreased NOTCH signalling, some idiopathic <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> have increased NOTCH signalling. The pathogenesis of these lesions also differs, with loss of ALK 1 causing expansion of the shunt through proliferation, and NOTCH gain-of-function inducing initial shunt enlargement by cellular hypertrophy. Hence, we propose that idiopathic <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> are distinct from those of HHT. In this review, we explore the role of ALK 1 -NOTCH interactions in {{the development}} of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> and examine a possible role of two signalling pathways downstream of ALK 1, TMEM 100 and IDs, in the development of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> in HHT.

40|$|Fifteen {{to fifty}} percent of {{patients}} with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia have pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to measure the effect of the presence of pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> and of their embolisation on respiratory-related quality of life (QoL). We prospectively recruited patients with a diagnosis of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia based on the Curaçao criteria and/or the identification of a pathogenic mutation. Respiratory-related quality of life was measured using the Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Patients who underwent embolisation of pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> completed the questionnaire before and 6 – 12 mo after the procedure. The 56 participants were divided into three groups: no pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> (group A, n = 10), small pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> not accessible to embolotherapy (group B, n = 19), and large pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> accessible to embolotherapy (group C, n = 27). The SGRQ score was significantly higher in group C compared to the other groups, indicating a worse respiratory-specific QoL. There was no significant difference between groups A and B. Among the 17 patients who underwent an embolisation, the SGRQ score decreased significantly after the procedure, to a value similar to that in patients without pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation.</b> Our results indicate that the presence of large but not small pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> negatively affects the respiratory-related quality of life and that embolisation of pulmonary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Pregnancy {{has been}} linked to {{increased}} rates of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> rupture. This link remains a matter of debate and very few studies have addressed the management of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> in pregnancy. Unruptured <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> in pregnant woman generally warrant conservative management due to the low rupture risk. When pregnant women present with ruptured <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation,</b> however, surgery is often indicated due to the increased risk of re-rupture and associated mortality. Endovascular embolization is widely accepted as an important component of contemporary, multimodal therapy for <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations.</b> Although rarely curative, embolization can facilitate subsequent surgical resection or radiosurgery. No previous reports have been devoted to the endovascular management of an <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> in a pregnant woman. Case presentation A 23 -year-old Caucasian woman presented with headache and visual disturbance after the rupture of a left parieto-occipital <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> in the 22 nd week of her pregnancy. After involving high-risk obstetric consultants and taking precautions to shield the fetus from ionizing radiation, we proceeded with a single stage of endovascular embolization followed soon after by open surgical resection of the <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation.</b> There were several goals for the angiography in this patient: to better understand the anatomy of the <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation,</b> including the number and orientation of feeding arteries and draining veins; to look for associated pre-nidal or intra-nidal aneurysms; and to partially embolize the <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> via safely-accessible feeders to facilitate surgical resection and minimize blood loss and operative morbidity. Conclusion From our experience and review of the literature, we maintain that ruptured <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> in pregnancy may be managed in a similar manner to those in non-gravid women. Precautions should be taken to reduce the operative time and exposure of the fetus to ionizing radiation and contrast agents. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{different}} results from flat panel detector CT in various pathologies have provoked some discussion. Our {{aim was to}} assess the role of flat panel detector CT in brain <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations,</b> which has not yet been assessed. Five patients with brain <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations</b> were studied with flat panel detector CT, DSC-MR imaging, and vessel-encoded pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling. In glomerular brain <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations,</b> perfusion was highest next to the brain <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> with decreasing values with increasing distance from the lesion. An inverse tendency was observed in the proliferative brain <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation.</b> Flat panel detector CT, originally thought to measure blood volume, correlated more closely with arterial spin-labeling-CBF and DSC-CBF than with DSC-CBV. We conclude that flat panel detector CT perfusion depends on the time point chosen for data collection, which is triggered too early in these patients (ie, when contrast agent appears in the superior sagittal sinus after rapid shunting through the brain <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation).</b> This finding, in combination with high data variability, makes flat panel detector CT inappropriate for perfusion assessment in brain <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Auricular <b>Arteriovenous</b> <b>Malformation</b> of the {{external}} ear is a rarely encountered disease; in particular, <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> arising from the auricle, with spontaneous bleeding, has seldom been reported. Objective: In the current study, we report an unusual case of late-onset auricular <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> originating from the posterior auricular artery that was confirmed by computed tomographic angiography. The case was successfully managed by pre-surgical intravascular embolization followed by total lesion excision. Prompted by this case, we also present a scoping review of the literature. Methods: A case of a 60 year-old man with right auricular <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> treated in our tertiary care center, and 52 patients with auricular <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> described in 10 case reports and a retrospective review are presented. Auricular <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> can manifest as swelling of the ear, pulsatile tinnitus, pain, and/or bleeding. On physical examination, a pulsatile swelling and/or a tender mass is evident. When <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> is suspected, the lesions should be visualized using imaging modalities that optimally detect vascular lesions, and managed via embolization, mass excision, or auricular resection. Effectiveness of the various diagnostic methods used and the treatment outcomes were analyzed. Results: Various imaging modalities including Doppler sonography, computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and/or transfemoral cerebral angiography were used to diagnose 38 cases reported in the literature. In another 15 cases, no imaging was performed; treatment was determined solely by physical examination and auscultation. Of the total of 53 cases, 12 were not treated (their symptoms were merely observed) whereas 20 underwent therapeutic embolization. In total, 32 patients, including 1 patient who was not treated and 10 with persistent or aggravated <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> after previous embolization, underwent mass excision or auricular resection depending {{on the extent of}} the lesion. No major postoperative complication was recorded. The postoperative follow-up duration varied from 1 month to 19 years, and only one case of unresectable, residual cervicofacial <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> was recorded. Conclusion: Auricular <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>malformation</b> is a rarely encountered disease, but should be suspected if a patient presents with a swollen ear and pulsatile tinnitus.
