40|$|The {{formation}} of centralized states in Europe {{and other areas}} of the world {{has been one of the}} major features of modern history. The key element for realization of a nation-state, namely the central government’s capacity to control the population and mobilize resources, often ran into competition and conflict with the private interests of local magnates, religious institutions, or commercial establishments that directly controlled the primary producers. In Europe, the separation of state and society has been established through the working out of conflicts and compromises in the process of state making. In China, the state has had a longer history. For historians of China, one cluster of important questions has concerned the relationships among the state, local elites, and the peasant masses during the two millennia of imperial rule.

Despite the success of the first novel and subsequent endeavours novels ~ short-stories, non-fiction studies, plays, movies ~ television appearances there has been little formal critical attention given to O'Brien's work, particularly in North America. It seems to me that O'Brien is a writer of very considerable talent; she is a craftsman in prose, and a distinguished and distinctive one. The {{purpose of this study is}} to test this contention by considering the immediate, accessible qualities of O'Brien's work and subjecting the work to close, critical scrutiny. This critical introduction will consider the trilogy bf novels, The Country Girls ~ Girl with Green Eyes and Girls in their Married Bliss. Although these novels do not have the power and impact of the fully developed later voice, they do lay the foundation for the mature work. Each work is complete in itself but a better understanding of O'Brien's vision comes by examining the works as part of the whole.

It was commonly believed amongst them, that the famous Malek Ric, Richard of England, the conqueror of Saladin, had come to life again, and was battling in the Spanish hosts--that this, his second life, was a charmed one, and his body inaccessible to blow of scimitar or thrust of spear--that after battle he ate the hearts and drank the blood of many young Moors for his supper: a thousand wild legends were told of Ivanhoe, indeed, so that the Morisco warriors came half vanquished into the field, and fell an easy prey to the Spaniards, who cut away among them without mercy. And although none of the Spanish historians whom I have consulted make mention of Sir Wilfrid as the real author of the numerous triumphs which now graced the arms of the good cause, this is not in the least to be wondered at, in a nation that has always been notorious for bragging, and for the non-payment <b>of</b> their <b>debts</b> <b>of</b> <b>gratitude</b> as <b>of</b> their other obligations, and that writes histories of the Peninsular war with the Emperor Napoleon, without making the slightest mention of his Grace the Duke of Wellington, or of the part taken by BRITISH VALOR in that transaction.
