5|$|In WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2008, GM Mode was {{combined}} into one game mode called WWE 24/7 Mode. This basically allowed Superstars to train, make special appearances or other actions between matches during full calendar years. After achieving specific goals through the game, a percentage will increase {{of becoming a}} WWE Hall of Famer / General Manager of the Year winner, and the mode does not <b>end</b> <b>until</b> this percentage reaches 100%.|$|E
5|$|Prehistoric Orkney {{refers to}} a period in the human {{occupation}} of the Orkney archipelago of Scotland that was {{the latter part of}} these islands' prehistory. The period of prehistory prior to occupation by the genus Homo is part of the geology of Scotland. Although some written records refer to Orkney during the Roman invasions of Scotland, prehistory in northern Scotland does not <b>end</b> <b>until</b> the commencement of the Early Historic Period around AD 600.|$|E

5|$|They were {{defeated}} in their Test against Australia {{and in all}} three against the All Blacks. The All Blacks' side was particularly strong and won all its Tests between 1965 and 1970. France's touring losses presaged a string of defeats that did not <b>end</b> <b>until</b> they drew against Wales in the 1969 Five Nations (in which France finished last).|$|E
5|$|After Peach's castle is {{sent back}} to the ground and Mario defeats Bowser, he recounts his tale to Luigi, who had {{remained}} at home while Mario went on the adventure. Peach throws a huge party to honor Mario and his allies for saving the entire kingdom, which is then followed by a parade during the credits. In the end, Mario and Peach exit their parade float and gaze up the sky, seeing fireworks. This part will not <b>end</b> <b>until</b> the player turns off the console. When restarted, the file will restart from the last save.|$|E
5|$|Fertig {{was part}} of plans for a faction to feud with The Undertaker in mid-2008, however, he {{underwent}} hip surgery in September, and the plans did not proceed. He competed in his final match in FCW on December 4, when he, Sheamus, and Gavin Spears were defeated by Joe Hennig, Johnny Prime, and Eric Escobar in a six-man elimination match. In January 2009, he was offered a new contract with WWE, but turned it down. As a result, WWE {{announced that he had}} been released from contract by request on January 9, although his contract did not technically <b>end</b> <b>until</b> April 5, preventing him from wrestling for other promotions.|$|E

5|$|Major General James Robertson confiscated {{surviving}} uninhabited {{homes of}} known Patriots and assigned them to British officers. Churches, {{other than the}} state churches (Church of England) were converted into prisons, infirmaries, or barracks. Some of the common soldiers were billeted with civilian families. There was a great influx of Loyalist refugees into the city resulting in further overcrowding, {{and many of these}} returning and additional Loyalists from Patriot-controlled areas encamped in squalid tent cities on the charred ruins. The fire convinced the British to put the city under martial law rather than returning it to civilian authorities. Crime and poor sanitation were persistent problems during the British occupation, which did not <b>end</b> <b>until</b> they evacuated the city on November 25, 1783.|$|E
5|$|The 256,300 man strong U.S. First Army, {{commanded}} by General Courtney Hodges, {{was ordered to}} break through the Siegfried Line around the area of Aachen, in order to reach the Rur river. Although the First Army began to encircle the area around Aachen in early September, the Battle of Aachen did not <b>end</b> <b>until</b> 21 October. The city cost the Americans roughly 3,000 casualties, but had opened the path to the Rur (river) river. Despite the casualties taken the ground gained was comparatively worthless, and the fighting for Aachen had not necessarily brought German defeat any closer.|$|E
5|$|The Revolutionary War had ended, but {{the border}} war with American Indians {{north of the}} Ohio River resumed with the Northwest Indian War. In September 1786, Boone {{took part in a}} {{military}} expedition into the Ohio Country led by Benjamin Logan. Back in Limestone, Boone housed and fed Shawnees who were captured during the raid, and helped to negotiate a truce and prisoner exchange. Although the war escalated and would not <b>end</b> <b>until</b> the American victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, the 1786 expedition was the last time Boone saw military action.|$|E

5|$|The territories were {{governed by}} {{mandatory}} powers, {{such as the}} United Kingdom {{in the case of}} the Mandate of Palestine, and the Union of South Africa in the case of South West Africa, until the territories were deemed capable of self-government. Fourteen mandate territories were divided up among seven mandatory powers: the United Kingdom, the Union of South Africa, France, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia and Japan. With the exception of the Kingdom of Iraq, which joined the League on 3 October 1932, these territories did not begin to gain their independence until after the Second World War, in a process that did not <b>end</b> <b>until</b> 1990. Following the demise of the League, most of the remaining mandates became United Nations Trust Territories.|$|E
5|$|Ashbrook was {{defeated}} {{for re-election in}} the 1920 elections; at that time congressional terms did not <b>end</b> <b>until</b> March 4 of the following year. He was friendly with the new committee chairman Albert Henry Vestal (Republican–Indiana), and persuaded him to schedule {{a hearing on the}} peace coin proposal for December 14, 1920. Though no bill was put before it, the committee heard from the ANA delegates, discussed the matter, and favored the use of the silver dollar, which as a large coin had the most room for an artistic design. The committee took no immediate action; in March 1921, after the Harding administration took office, Vestal met with the new Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew W. Mellon, and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker about the matter, finding them supportive so long as the redesign involved no expense.|$|E
5|$|From May 8 through July 24, Affeldt had a twentyeight inning {{scoreless}} streak. During the streak, on May 15, {{he struck}} out a seasonhigh four batters in an 86 loss to the Mets. On May 31, he entered a game against St. Louis with runners on first and third and Albert Pujols on deck in the eighth, and {{he struck out}} Joe Thurston to end the inning and help the Giants win 53. The streak did not <b>end</b> <b>until</b> July 28, when Brandon Medders allowed one of Affeldt's runners to score {{in a game against}} Pittsburgh. On August 2, with runners on first and second with one out in the eighth inning against the Philadelphia Phillies, he retired Chase Utley and Ryan Howard to help the Giants win 73. He won the final game of the season against San Diego by pitching two scoreless innings as the Giants won 43 in ten innings. Affeldt finished the season with a career best 1.73 ERA in seventyfour games. He was named tenth on one writer's ballot for MVP voting, placing him in a tie for twentyeighth on the list. On December 17, he won the This Year in Baseball Setup Man of the Year Award.|$|E

5|$|However, Matsui {{had made}} it clear to his {{superiors}} even before he had left Japan in August that he was determined to capture the capital city of China, Nanking, which lay 300 kilometers west of Shanghai. Matsui forcefully asserted that the war with China would not <b>end</b> <b>until</b> Nanking was in their control, and he envisaged that the fall of Nanking would result in the total collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's government. After Chiang's fall Matsui hoped {{to play a role in}} forming a new government in China which, according to his own conception, would be a democracy that would better serve the interests of both Japan and the people of China. However, the historian Tokushi Kasahara also sees personal motives behind Matsui's insistence on capturing Nanking. Kasahara suspects that Matsui, as an aging general with a relatively undistinguished military record, desperately wanted to crown his career with one last battlefield victory like the capture of the Chinese capital.|$|E
5|$|In 1853, Irvingite Catholics (Catholic-Apostolic) began worshipping in a {{building}} in the West <b>End</b> <b>until</b> the church was closed. The Roman Catholic church began in Frome after {{the building of a}} temporary church in Park Road in 1928, and a new church, St Catharine's Catholic Church, was finally built on the site in 1967 and 1968. Rook Lane Chapel, a noncomformist chapel, was in use from 1707 until 1968. In 1773, a split in the congregation of Rook Lane led to the establishment of another Zion Congregational Church in Whittox Lane. This building was replaced in 1810, and was extended in 1888 (a separate, octagonal school room with a conical roof having been built on the grounds in 1875). A Quaker Meeting House existed in Sheppards Barton, now South Parade, from 1675 to 1856. The original building was replaced around 1730 with a simple unadorned stone building comprising a single meeting room with wrought iron gallery above. The building became a school, the town library, Red Cross centre and, since 1999, the offices of a software company. The present chapel-like appearance was created in a 1993 refurbishment by the Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{received}} a papal dispensation for his illegitimacy on 25 January 1220, {{on the recommendation}} of the king, Stephen Langton the Archbishop of Canterbury, other bishops, and the papal legate Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, all of whom testified to his good reputation and character. In late October he was named chancellor of the see of Chichester, but was then elected Bishop of Chichester on about 1 November 1222. He was given control of the temporalities of the bishopric on 3 November 1222, and was consecrated on 21 April 1224. In April 1223 Neville was ordered by Pope Honorius III to cease using the Great Seal on the command of the justiciar or other members of the minority council, but instead to do so only at the king's command, essentially ending the royal minority. But it did not finally <b>end</b> <b>until</b> December 1223, and even then, as the king had not yet been officially declared of age, the ban on grants without a fixed time limit remained in force.|$|E

It {{was replaced by the}} highly computerized Pentax ZX-M (also called MZ-M) in 1998.|$|R
5|$|The popular view of Richard {{has more}} than {{anything}} been influenced by Shakespeare's play about the king, Richard II. Shakespeare's Richard was a cruel, vindictive and irresponsible king, who attained a semblance of greatness only after his fall from power. Writing a work of fiction, however, Shakespeare took many liberties and made great omissions. Shakespeare based his play on works by writers such as Edward Hall and Samuel Daniel, who in turn based their writings on contemporary chroniclers such as Thomas Walsingham. Hall and Daniel were part of Tudor historiography, which was highly unsympathetic to Richard. The Tudor orthodoxy, reinforced by Shakespeare, saw a continuity in civil discord starting with Richard's misrule that did not <b>end</b> <b>until</b> Henry VII's accession in 1485. The idea that Richard was {{to blame for the}} later-15th century Wars of the Roses was prevalent as late as the 19th century, but came to be challenged in the 20th. Some recent historians prefer to look at the Wars of the Roses in isolation from the reign of Richard II.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} written {{for most of its}} 155-issue run by comic book writer, artist, and editor Larry Hama, and was notable for its realistic, character-based {{storytelling}} style, unusual for a toy comic at the time. Hama wrote the series spontaneously, never knowing how a story would <b>end</b> <b>until</b> it was finished, but worked closely with the artists, giving them sketches of the characters and major scenes. While most stories involved the G.I. Joe Team battling against the forces of Cobra Command, an evil terrorist organization, many also focused on the relationships and background stories of the characters. Hama created most characters in collaboration with Hasbro, and used a system of file cards {{to keep track of the}} personalities and fictional histories of his characters, which later became a major selling point for the action figure line.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, President-elect Taft {{announced}} his intent to nominate Senator Philander C. Knox to be Secretary of State. Shortly after the announcement, the Clause {{emerged as a}} problem that caught those involved by surprise: Knox had been elected to serve a term that would not <b>end</b> <b>until</b> 1911, and during that term Congress had voted to increase executive branch pay. Members of Congress considered reverting the fix after the appointed nominee had resigned and assumed the post so that Knox {{would not have to}} forgo any emoluments. Members of Congress also discussed reverting the salaries of all United States Cabinet members. At the suggestion of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Congress passed a bill reducing only the Secretary of State's salary to the level it had been at before Knox's term began, believing this would cure the problem. The Senate passed the bill unanimously, but there was much more opposition in the U.S. House of Representatives, where the same measure failed to get a required two-thirds vote under a motion to suspend the rules and pass, a procedure normally reserved for uncontroversial matters. After a different procedural rule was applied, it passed by a 173–115 majority vote and President Roosevelt subsequently signed the bill. On March 4, the first Saxbe fix became effective when the salary of the Secretary of State (but not that of other Cabinet members) was reverted from $12,000 to $8,000. The Senate confirmed all of Taft's Cabinet appointees on March 5, and Knox took office on March 6.|$|E
