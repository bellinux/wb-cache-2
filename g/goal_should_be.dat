The code should be refactored over time to make it simple and clear, not just constantly add new features. The <b>goal</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> code that is “obviously right”, as opposed to code that is so complicated that “I can’t see any problems”.|$|E

25|$|Denmark, {{a country}} with high cycling levels, does not use one-way systems to improve traffic flow.

For example, in California nearly 60% of the state's waste comes from commercial buildings During the construction phase, one <b>goal</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{to reduce the}} amount of material going to landfills. Well-designed buildings also help reduce the amount of waste generated by the occupants as well, by providing on-site solutions such as compost bins to reduce matter going to landfills.|$|E
25|$|Goal-setting {{theory is}} based on the notion that {{individuals}} sometimes have a drive to reach a clearly defined end state. Often, this end state is a reward in itself. A goal's efficiency is affected by three features: proximity, difficulty and specificity. One common goal setting methodology incorporates the SMART criteria, in which goals are: specific, measurable, attainable/achievable, relevant, and time-bound. An ideal goal should present a situation where the time between the initiation of behavior and the end state is close. This explains why some children are more motivated to learn how to ride a bike than to master algebra. A <b>goal</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> moderate, not too hard or too easy to complete. In both cases, most people are not optimally motivated, as many want a challenge (which assumes some kind of insecurity of success). At the same time people want to feel that there is a substantial probability that they will succeed. Specificity concerns the description of the goal in their class. The <b>goal</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> objectively defined and intelligible for the individual. A classic example of a poorly specified goal is to get the highest possible grade. Most children have no idea how much effort they need to reach that goal.|$|E
5000|$|As {{discussed}} by Slocombe (1998a), <b>goals</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> broadly applicable, measurable and readily observable, and ideally be collectively supported {{in order to}} be achievable. The idea is to provide direction for both thinking and action and should try to minimize managing ecosystems in a static state. <b>Goals</b> <b>should</b> also <b>be</b> flexible enough to incorporate a measure of uncertainty and be able to evolve as conditions and knowledge change. This may involve focusing on specific threatening processes, such as habitat loss or introduced invasive species, occurring within an ecosystem. Overall the <b>goals</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> integrative, to include the structure, organization and processes of the management of an area. Correct ecosystem-based management <b>should</b> <b>be</b> based in <b>goals</b> that are both [...] "substantive", to explain the aims and importance of protecting an area, and [...] "procedural", to explain how substantive goals will be met.|$|R

Zani critiqued the idea of internationalization as being too predetermined and focused on strategies and administrative policies, whereas he advocated the denominational <b>goal</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> globalization, which he defined as [...] "that process by which we become sensitized and responsive to the multi-cultural, multi-lingual, multi-ethnic, and multi-national world of which we are a part."

In early 1968, {{he was invited to}} a White House luncheon to discuss Indochina. After the luncheon, Ridgway met privately for two hours with President Lyndon Johnson and Vice-President Hubert Humphrey. When asked his opinion, Ridgway advised against deeper involvement in Vietnam and against using force to resolve the Pueblo Incident. In an article in Foreign Affairs, Ridgway stated that political <b>goals</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> based on vital national interests and that military <b>goals</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> consistent with and support the political goals, but that neither situation was true in the Vietnam War.|$|R
2500|$|A multi-option poll by Near East Consulting (NEC) in November 2007 {{found the}} bi-national {{state to be}} less popular than either [...] "two states for two people" [...] or [...] "a Palestinian state on all {{historic}} Palestine" [...] with only 13.4% of respondents supporting a binational solution. However, in February 2007, NEC found that around 70% of Palestinian respondents backed the idea when given a straight choice of either supporting or opposing [...] "a one-state solution in historic Palestine where Muslims, Christians and Jews have equal rights and responsibilities". In March 2010, {{a survey by the}} Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research and the Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem found that Palestinian support had risen to 29 percent. In April 2010, a poll by the Jerusalem Media and Communication Centre also found that Palestinian support for a [...] "bi-national" [...] solution had jumped from 20.6 percent in June 2009 to 33.8 percent. If this support for a bi-national state is combined with the finding that 9.8 percent of Palestinian respondents favour a [...] "Palestinian state" [...] in [...] "all of historic Palestine", this poll suggested about equal Palestinian support for a two-state and one-state solution in mid-2010. In 2011, a poll by Stanley Greenberg and the Palestinian Center for Public Opinion and sponsored by the Israel Project revealed that 61% of Palestinians reject a two state solution, while 34% said they accepted it. 66% said the Palestinians’ real <b>goal</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> to start with a two-state solution but then move to it all being one Palestinian state.|$|E

5000|$|Goal {{setting is}} the process of {{systematically}} planning ways to achieve specific accomplishments within a certain amount of time. [...] Research suggests that <b>goals</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> specific, measurable, difficult but attainable, time-based, written down, and a combination of short-term and long-term goals. [...] A meta-analysis of goal setting in sport suggests that when compared to setting no goals or [...] "do your best" [...] goals, setting the above types of goals is an effective method for improving performance. According to Dr. Eva V. Monsma, short-term <b>goals</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> used to help achieve long-term goals. Dr. Monsma also states {{that it is important to}} [...] "set goals in positive terms by focusing on behaviors that <b>should</b> <b>be</b> present rather than those that <b>should</b> <b>be</b> absent." [...] Each long-term <b>goal</b> <b>should</b> also have a series of short-term goals that progress in difficulty. For instance, short-term <b>goals</b> <b>should</b> progress from those that are easy to achieve to those that are more challenging. Having challenging short-term goals will remove the repetitiveness of easy goals and will give one an edge when striving for their long-term goals.|$|R
