40|$|Lumezzane, {{a village}} in the Lombard Prealps, in XVIII and XIX century was {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} important manufactures favoured by the local availability of raw material and water power. People worked in forges of 2 nd level and produced components for fire-arms, sidearms and hand-manufactured goods in iron or in brass. People financed their activities by domestic patrimony or contracting mortgage debts from private individuals or charitable institutions: it was impossible to have credit without securities as lands or houses, so {{it is very important to}} know the way used for conveyance of the family estates and the dimensions of lands and houses market. This paper concerns just real estates market and analyses the type of acts (sales, barters or free assignations), the level of commercialisation of houses and lands, the social relationships between buyers and sellers, the prices registered on the land and house market as well as the ways in which transactions on real estates were settled (by cash or annual instalments with or without <b>interest,</b> <b>settlement</b> of precedent debts or release to other properties). ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} private {{law of the}} United States and Japan that applies to the holding of {{securities}} through intermediaries, such as securities firms and banks. In particular, it focuses on Articles 8 and 9 of the United States Uniform Commercial Code and the Japanese Book-Entry Transfer Act. That act is now in effect in Japan for most securities other than equity securities and it will become operative for equities in January 2009. The paper also examines the proposed UNIDROIT Draft Convention on Substantive Rules regarding Intermediated Securities. The Convention will be discussed at a diplomatic conference {{to be held in}} Geneva in September 2008, with the goal of adopting a final text. It considers the Convention on alternative assumptions that the non-Convention law is the law of the United States or the law of Japan. It generally concludes that the functional approach (i. e., result- oriented, as opposed to doctrine- or theory-oriented) adopted by the Convention is successful and appropriate. Finally, the paper considers differences between United States law and Japanese law in the context of similarities and differences in the principal systems and practices for clearance and settlement of securities transactions in the United States and Japan. book-entry, central securities depository, intermediary, securities, securities account, security <b>interest,</b> <b>settlement...</b>|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of {{commuting}} {{of workers}} and students according to selected sociodemographic characteristics in selected municipalities in the South Moravian Region. Diploma thesis, Brno: Mendel University, 2016. The subject of the diploma thesis is evaluation of commuting to work and schools according to selected sociodemographic characteristics of the district and other selected cities in the South Moravia. They are also evaluated the interdistrict directional currents, the development of commuting between referenced years and the commuting balance. For selected indicators is made a comparison between years 2001 and 2011. In this timeframe, indicators of commuting to work are analysed by gender, age, economic activity, frequency (whether people commute daily) and spend time of commuting. An analysis of commuting to school is analysed according to age (divided into categories 6 - 14 years and more than 15 years) and the frequency (again, whether commute daily). On {{the basis of the}} data is calculated and compared the complex functional size of <b>interest</b> <b>settlements</b> and further there is projected in a cartographic form the commuting hinterland of Brno. The diploma thesis shows the overall decline of the number of commuters in the observed period, but this phenomenon still has a great importance. We can expect a significant impact of commuting {{on the development of the}} region and therefore this thesis can be used as a basis for process strategic plans of the observed municipalities...|$|R

Two international conferences in 1971, in Eastern and Western Europe, signaled the academic maturity of the field, and the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Human Settlements in Vancouver will set the final seal of respectability {{on the notion that}} urban and regional issues matter {{in national}} development plans. From the inception of urban-related work at IIASA in early 1974, there has been a keen <b>interest</b> in <b>settlement</b> systems and planning policy. In December 1974, some forty scholars from fifteen countries gathered here to share insights on research and policy in these areas. Two other volumes of proceedings and contributed papers are available. This volume collects in one place the conference articles describing policies in specific nations. The material on western countries adds to an already well-developed literature, except for the article by Logan and Wilmoth, which is the first comprehensive account of the recent and dramatic policy developments in Australia. On the other hand, the several pieces on policies in the centrally-planned economies of Eastern Europe will be largely new to English-language readers, and the appended bibliographies on the GDR and Hungary do not exist elsewhere at all...|$|R

50|$|Most {{registered}} banks hold settlement {{accounts at}} the Reserve Bank, {{which are used}} to settle obligations with {{each other at the}} end of the day. For example, if you write out a cheque or make an EFT-POS payment, the money is paid by your bank to the bank of the recipient. Many hundreds of thousands of such transactions are made every day. The Bank pays <b>interest</b> on <b>settlement</b> account balances, and charges interest on overnight borrowing, at rates related to the OCR. These rates are reviewed from time to time, as is the OCR. The most crucial part of the system is the fact that the Reserve Bank sets no limit on the amount of cash it will borrow or lend at rates related to the OCR.|$|R
