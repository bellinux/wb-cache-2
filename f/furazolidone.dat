5|$|Several {{antibiotics}} {{have been}} used successfully to treat S.iniae infection in fish. Enrofloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic, {{has been used to}} great effect in hybrid striped bass (Morone chrysops√ó M.saxatilis), although evidence suggested the development of a resistant strain. Amoxicillin, erythromycin, <b>furazolidone,</b> and oxytetracycline have also been used (the last with varying success, only in barramundi). Vaccination against S.iniae has been attempted with limited success as it only provides up to 6 months' immunity.|$|E
25|$|Doxycycline is {{typically}} used first line, although some strains of V. cholerae have shown resistance. Testing for resistance during an outbreak can help determine appropriate future choices. Other antibiotics {{proven to be}} effective include cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and <b>furazolidone.</b> Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, also may be used, but resistance has been reported.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine {{has serious}} {{interactions}} {{that can be}} dangerous with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., <b>furazolidone,</b> isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, procarbazine, selegiline, tranylcypromine). Such patients may suffer agitation, delirium, headache, convulsions, and/or hyperthermia. Fatal interactions have been reported including the death of Libby Zion. It {{is thought to be}} caused by an increase in cerebral serotonin concentrations. It is probable that pethidine can also interact with a number of other medications, including muscle relaxants, some antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and ethanol.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{in vitro}} study from Pakistan found 40% of {{isolates}} {{are resistant to}} common antiprotozoal drugs. A study of isolates from patients diagnosed with IBS found 40% of isolates resistant to metronidazole and 32% resistant to <b>furazolidone.</b> Drugs reported in studies {{to be effective in}} eradicating Blastocystis infection have included metronidazole, trimethoprim, TMP-SMX (only trimethoprim is active with sulphamethoxazole demonstrating no activity), tetracycline, doxycycline, nitazoxanide, pentamidine, paromomycin and iodoquinol. Iodoquinol {{has been found to be}} less effective in practice than in-vitro. Miconazole and quinacrine have been reported as effective agents against Blastocystis growth in-vitro. Rifaximin, and albendazole have shown promise as has ivermectin which demonstrated high effectiveness against blastocystis hominis isolates in an in vitro study. There is also evidence that the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, and the plant mallotus oppositifolius may be effective against Blastocystis infections.|$|E
25|$|Many {{substances}} {{are potentially}} harmful {{to people with}} G6PD deficiency. Variation {{in response to these}} substances makes individual predictions difficult. Antimalarial drugs that can cause acute hemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency include primaquine, pamaquine, and chloroquine. There is evidence that other antimalarials may also exacerbate G6PD deficiency, but only at higher doses. Sulfonamides (such as sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole, and mafenide), thiazolesulfone, methylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency as they antagonize folate synthesis, as should certain analgesics (such as phenazopyridine and acetanilide) and a few non-sulfa antibiotics (nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, dapsone, and <b>furazolidone).</b> Henna has been known to cause hemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient infants. Rasburicase is also contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. High dose intravenous vitamin C has also been known to cause haemolysis in G6PD deficiency carriers, thus G6PD deficiency testing is routine before infusion of doses of 25g or more.|$|E
500|$|Lastly, some drugs, such as <b>furazolidone,</b> furoxone, benomyl, fumagillin, {{proguanil}} and clamoxyquine, {{have been}} shown to impede spore development, which reduces infection rates. [...] For example, one study showed that feeding fumagillin to O. mykiss reduced the number of infected fish from between 73% and 100% to between 10% and 20%.

2500|$|Physicians have {{described}} the successful use {{of a variety of}} discontinued antiprotozoals in treatment of Blastocystis infection.

Clioquinol (Entero-vioform) was noted as successful in treatment of Blastocystis infection but removed from the market following an adverse event in Japan. Stovarsol and Narsenol, two arsenic-based antiprotozoals, were reported to be effective against the infection. Carbarsone was available as an anti-infective compound in the United States as late as 1991, and was suggested as a possible treatment. The reduction in the availability of antiprotozoal drugs has been noted as a complicating factor in treatment of other protozoal infections. [...] For example, in Australia, production of diloxanide furoate ended in 2003, paromomycin is available under special access provisions, and the availability of iodoquinol is limited.|$|E

Both <b>furazolidone</b> and tetracycline significantly reduced the rate of stool output within 18 to 24 hours of starting antibiotic treatment. <b>Furazolidone</b> was significantly less effective than tetracycline in rapidly and consistently terminating vibrio excretion. One convalescent carrier of cholera vibrios was identified among control patients; none was identified among patients treated with either tetracycline or <b>furazolidone.</b> All Vibrio cholerae strains tested were sensitive to tetracycline and <b>furazolidone,</b> but larger concentrations of the latter were required to achieve inhibition of growth.

40|$|Background & aim: due to {{the risks}} to human health, {{particularly}} in terms of carcinogenicity, the application of <b>Furazolidone</b> in animals which their products are consumed by human population is strongly prohibited.

Methods: In the present cross-sectional study which was conducted within six months, 100 broiler carcasses were randomly collected from Ahvaz slaughterhouses. Then by using ice, the carcasses were transported to the laboratory in less than 24 hours inorder to illicit the amount of <b>furazolidone</b> drug by the HPLC method. After extraction and degrading processes, using Ethyl-acetate and related protocols for isolation of <b>Furazolidone</b> from muscles, and also calibrating HPLC system to obtain standard curves, the amount of 20 microliters of each sample was injected to the HPLC device and the amounts of <b>Furazolidone</b> were determined in the mixture of pectoral and femoral muscles. Finally the obtained results were statistically analysed by using one sample t-test in the SPSS software. Results: The mean <b>Furazolidone</b> concentration in the mixture of femoral and thorasic muscles was 28. 15 ¬± 2. 37 mg/kg.
