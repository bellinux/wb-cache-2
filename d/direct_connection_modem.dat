25|$|Multiplayer can be {{done with}} up to four players. Multiplayer characters' states are saved periodically. Players can either be {{aggressive}} towards, or play co-operatively with, other players. Players can connect by one of the following: <b>direct</b> <b>connection,</b> <b>modem</b> connection, Battle.net connection or IPX network connection. The game lacks the stronger anti-cheating methods of Blizzard's later games and as a result, many characters online have been altered in various ways by common third-party programs known as trainers and/or game editing programs such as Cheat Engine.|$|E

These {{practices are}} applicable to your organization if your networked systems infrastructure includes host systems {{providing services to}} multiple users (file servers, timesharing systems, database servers, Internet servers, etc.) local-area or wide-area networks <b>direct</b> <b>connections,</b> gateways, or <b>modem</b> access to and from external networks, such as the Internet We recommend that you read all of the practices in this module before taking any action. To successfully implement the practices, {{it is important that}} you understand the overall context and relationships among them. For instance, once you read the practices in the Handle category, it is easier to understand the Practices in the Prepare category (see the Summary of recommended practices table). If you are dealing with an intrusion, you may want to skip the first two preparatory practices and move immediately to Practice 3, Analyze all information necessary to characterize an intrusion. Once you have completed your response and recovery process, we recommend that you review and implement the preparatory practices...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{reviewed}} {{our experience}} with repair of truncus arteriosus {{to assess the}} effect of type of right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction on perioperative morbidity, survival, and freedom from catheter-based interventions and reoperation. MethodsPatients undergoing repair of truncus arteriosus from June 1990 through February 2004 were evaluated {{on the basis of}} operative procedure regarding preoperative and postoperative variables, the need for postoperative catheter-based intervention or reoperation, and survival on the basis of univariate, multivariable, and actuarial analyses. ResultsOf 54 study patients, 15 (28 %) received a valved homograft, and 39 (72 %) received a <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> with a variety of hood materials. Five (9. 1 %) patients died. Valved homograft recipients were more likely to require reoperation than patients receiving <b>direct</b> <b>connections</b> (40 % vs 15 %, P =. 046); however, valved homograft and <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> recipients had a similar incidence of the combined end point of reoperation or catheter-based intervention (40. 0 % vs 37. 5 %, P =. 865). Univariate and multivariable modeling demonstrated use of valved homografts or <b>direct</b> <b>connections</b> with an autologous pericardial hood to be predictive of the need for later catheter-based intervention or reoperation. Actuarial analysis demonstrated a trend toward improved outcomes in the <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> group and within the <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> cohort, a statistically significant difference on the basis of hood type. ConclusionsAlthough the <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> technique might not prevent later catheter-based intervention, it does reduce the need for reoperation. Outcomes among <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> recipients were associated with hood type: polytetrafluoroethylene hoods (W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc, Tempe, Ariz) had the lowest rate of reintervention, and untreated autologous pericardial hoods had the highest rate of reintervention. We report excellent outcomes with primary repair of truncus arteriosus. Where anatomically appropriate, we advocate the <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> technique...|$|R
