5|$|According to a rough estimation, as of 2010 {{there were}} up to 300,000 Swedish-speakers living outside Sweden and Finland.

A considerable majority of Swedish residents born outside Sweden (c. 1.5 million) speak Swedish and according to the ELDIA Project, there were c. 2,390,000 second-language speakers in Finland. According to a survey by the European Commission, 44% of respondents from Finland who did not have Swedish as a native language considered themselves to be proficient enough <b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> to hold a conversation, for a total of about 5 million second-language speakers.

5|$|In English, {{achievements}} of arms are usually described (blazoned) in a specialized jargon that uses derivatives of French terms. <b>In</b> <b>Swedish,</b> however, {{achievements of}} arms {{are described in}} relatively plain language, using only Swedish terms and tending to avoid specialized jargon. Examples {{include the use of}} Swedish blå and grön for blue and green, as compared to the French-derived azure and vert used in English blazon. Rather than argent, the Swedish words silver or vit (white) are used, and white, while rare, may be a different color than silver. Purpur (purple) is used in the lining of crowns and in the royal canopy of the greater national coat of arms. Traditionally, purple was rarely used as a tincture on the shield, though it does appear on the shields of some (especially modern) burgher arms. Ermine likewise appears in the lining of the mantling over the greater national coat of arms, but is otherwise virtually unknown <b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> heraldry. Vair is also rare in Scandinavian heraldry, and other furs are unknown.|$|E
