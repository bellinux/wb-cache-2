In contrast, in a spinful Luttinger liquid with SU(2) invariance, uncharged spin excitations can carry spin current without dephasing in spite of the presence of e-e interactions.

40|$|When time-reversal {{symmetry}} is weakly {{broken and}} interactions are neglected, {{the surface of}} a Z_ 2 topological <b>insulator</b> <b>supports</b> a half-quantized Hall conductivity σ_S = e^ 2 /(2 h). A surface Hall conductivity in an insulator is equivalent to a bulk magneto-electric polarizability, i. e. to a magnetic field dependent charge polarization. By performing an explicit calculation for the case in which the surface is approximated by a two-dimensional massive Dirac model and time-reversal symmetry is broken by weak ferromagnetism in the bulk, we demonstrate that there is a non-universal interaction correction to σ_S. For thin films interaction corrections to the top and bottom surface Hall conductivities cancel, however, implying that there is no correction to the quantized anomalous Hall effect in magnetically doped topological insulators.

The distinct difference between these hooks is the structures from which they arise; G. aperine hooks are stomatal in origin as are those of A. eupatoria and C. lutetiana while the hooks of G. urbanum arise from carpels.

40|$|A {{continuum}} {{model of}} an aprotic lithium/oxygen battery is validated against experimental first-discharge data {{and used to}} examine how the apparent cell capacity is affected by macroscopic multicomponent mass transfer, interfacial kinetics, and electronic conduction or tunneling through the discharge product. The model accounts for the three-phase nature of the positive electrode in detail, including an explicit discharge-product layer whose properties and volume distribution generally depend on thelocaldischargedepth. Several hypothetical positiveelectrode reaction mechanisms involving different product morphologies and electron-transfer sites are explored within the theoretical framework. To match experimental discharge-voltage vs. capacity and capacity vs. discharge-current trends qualitatively, the discharge-product layer must be assumed to have electronic resistivity several orders of magnitude lower than typical <b>insulators,</b> <b>supporting</b> {{the notion that the}} presence of lithium peroxide does not wholly prevent electrons from reaching dissolved reactants.

40|$|Topological <b>insulators</b> <b>supporting</b> non-abelian anyonic {{excitations}} are at {{the center}} of attention as candidates for topological quantum computation. In this paper, we analyze the ground-state properties of disordered non-abelian anyonic chains. The resemblance of fusion rules of non-abelian anyons and real space decimation strongly suggests that disordered chains of such anyons generically exhibit infinite-randomness phases. Concentrating on the disordered golden chain model with nearest-neighbor coupling, we show that Fibonacci anyons with the fusion rule τ⊗τ= 1 ⊕τ exhibit two infinite-randomness phases: a random-singlet phase when all bonds prefer the trivial fusion channel, and a mixed phase which occurs whenever a finite density of bonds prefers the τ fusion channel. Real space RG analysis shows that the random-singlet fixed point is unstable to the mixed fixed point. By analyzing the entanglement entropy of the mixed phase, we find its effective central charge, and find that it increases along the RG flow from the random singlet point, thus ruling out a c-theorem for the effective central charge.

40|$|The {{metallic}} surface {{states of}} a topological <b>insulator</b> <b>support</b> helical Dirac fermions protected by topology with their spin locked perpendicular to their momentum. They can acquire mass through magnetic doping or through hybridization of states on opposite faces of a thin sample. In this case {{there can be}} a component of electron spin oriented perpendicular to the surface plane. The electron-phonon interaction renormalizes the dynamics of the charge carriers through their spectral density. It also modifies the gap channel and a second spectral function enters which, not only determines the out of plane spin component, but also comes into in-plane properties. While the out of plane spin component is decreased below the Fermi momentum ($k_F$), the in plane component increases. There are also correlation tails extending well beyond $k_F$. The angular resolved photo-emission line shapes aquire Holstein side bands. The effective gap in the density of states is reduced and the optical conductivity aquires distinct measurable phonon structure even for modest value of the electron-phonon coupling.
