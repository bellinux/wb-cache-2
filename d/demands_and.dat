He settled in the central town of Gatooma, where he farmed, mined and set up an earth-moving contractor's business. In 1953, Southern Rhodesia became a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland alongside Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Each territory retained its own political status and government, and Southern Rhodesia's constitutional status was unaltered.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Patients' {{oral health}} needs are {{estimated}} through dialogue and professional assessment. The concepts of need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> {{are vital to}} studies of dental care and oral health. Need does not always lead to demand for treatment or to utilization, depending on the gatekeeping processes between need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> between <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> utilization. <b>Demand</b> must be accepted {{with the understanding that}} there is no objective need <b>and</b> that <b>demand</b> depends on the patient's opinion. In accordance with this, the need for prosthodontic treatment is highly individual and is not automatically related to oral health status, making need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> difficult to measure in that respect. Therefore, sociodental factors should be included and evaluated in studies of need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> for utilization of prosthodontic care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This theoretical and analytic paper focuses on the gatekeeping processes between need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> between <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> utilization of prosthodontic care. RESULTS: The concept of gatekeeping refers to the social and psychologic processes that transform need into <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> into utilization. It implies that they are complex processes that can render great differences between <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> actual utilization. CONCLUSION: It is not possible to estimate a patient's needs for prosthodontic care, since there is no objective need. <b>Demand</b> <b>and</b> utilization are factors that {{play an important role in}} the gatekeeping process. These factors are dependent on the patient's opinion, which is influenced by numerous factors...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s, Japanese inflation has been relatively stable with slight declines, while output has remained volatile with a prolonged stagnation. This paper attempts to explore possible explanations for these macroeconomic facts based on the aggregate <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> supply framework. Specifically, applying a vector autoregressive framework that allows for correlations between structural disturbances, it examines two broad questions in a unified way: (i) whether the slope of the short-run aggregate supply curve became significantly flattened and/or (ii) whether structural <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> supply shocks are more strongly positive correlated. Our results suggest that positive correlation between structural <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> supply shocks has become stronger since the 1990 s, while there is less evidence that the short-run aggregate supply curve has been flattened. We argue that shifts in aggregate <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> supply curves in the same direction lead to larger, permanent effects on output and to limited effects on prices in Japan.
