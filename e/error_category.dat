40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the risk of medical {{malpractice}} litigation for Italian radiologists, compared with the corresponding data in the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The insurance claims of Italian radiologists over the 1993 - 2006 period were anonymously assessed and classified according to the cause of the claim. RESULTS. A total of 1, 424 claims were filed during the examined period, with most claims being filed at a considerable time interval after the event (up to 10 years). The resulting incidence may be estimated as 44. 2 cases per 1, 000, meaning that 44 % of Italian radiologists have received, or will receive, summons regarding their professional activity during the past 10 years. CONCLUSION. The risk of medical malpractice litigation for Italian radiologists is by now comparable to that for American radiologists. Comparison with previous data concerning the same study population shows that the diagnostic <b>errors</b> <b>category</b> has surpassed all other <b>error</b> <b>categories</b> (nondiagnostic <b>errors)</b> and that, within the diagnostic <b>errors</b> <b>category,</b> claims for allegedly missed cancer have surpassed claims for allegedly missed bone abnormalities.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} two enhance-ments to a {{statistical}} machine translation based approach to grammar correction for correcting all <b>error</b> <b>categories.</b> First, we propose tuning the SMT systems to op-timize a metric more suited to the gram-mar correction task (F-β score) rather than the traditional BLEU metric used for tun-ing language translation tasks. Since the F-β score favours higher precision, tun-ing to this score can potentially improve precision. While the results do not indi-cate improvement due to tuning with the new metric, we believe this {{could be due to}} the small number of grammatical er-rors in the tuning corpus and further in-vestigation is required to answer the ques-tion conclusively. We also explore the combination of custom-engineered gram-mar correction techniques, which are tar-geted to specific <b>error</b> <b>categories,</b> with the SMT based method. Our simple ensem-ble methods yield improvements in recall but decrease the precision. Tuning the custom-built techniques can help in in-creasing the overall accuracy also. ...|$|R

Meanwhile, a new algorithm is proposed for learning the weights for these knowledge-based classifiers. Experiment results show that ensemble learning for material recognition with convolutional neural network could get higher accuracy than a knowledge-based classifier. And we also do some experiments with the prior methods; the results show that the way we proposed to combine the knowledge-based classifiers would have a better performance than the prior methods.|$|E

It sought to quantify improvement through the reduction of error rates and <b>error</b> <b>categories.</b> This small-scale quasi-experimental study involved 15 ESL doctoral students: 7 in an intervention group and 8 in a semi-equivalent control group. Participants wrote a short essay {{at the start of the}} study and a second essay ten weeks later at the conclusion of the study. These essays were analysed for errors, and it was found from linear regression analyses, assuming a constant percentage change in error rate across the groups, that the intervention group produced on average 43 % fewer errors at post-test while the control group’s error rate decreased by an average of 12 % at post-test. In terms of <b>error</b> <b>categories</b> present in students’ writing, the intervention group had on average 2. 4 fewer categories at post-test, while the control group had on average 0. 5 more <b>error</b> <b>categories.</b> These results suggest that for ESL doctoral students in the health sciences, substantial gains can be made within a maximum of 16 hours of written language support, while without such support, little if any improvements are likely to occur.

40|$|Superior early {{numerical}} competencies {{of children}} in several Asian countries have (amongst others) been attributed to the higher transparency of their number word systems. Here, we directly investigated this claim by evaluating whether Japanese children’s transcoding performance when writing numbers to dictation (e. g., twenty five  25) was less error prone than that of German-speaking children; both in general as well as when considering language-specific attributes of the German number word system such as the inversion property, in particular. In line with this hypothesis we observed that German-speaking children committed more transcoding errors in general than their Japanese peers. Moreover, their error pattern reflected the specific inversion intransparency of the German number-word system. Inversion errors in transcoding represented the most prominent <b>error</b> <b>category</b> in German-speaking children, but were almost absent in Japanese-speaking children.

The study was designed (1) to determine the types of errors found in Nepali government and non-government letters and to compare between the 1975 and 1980 samples, and (2) to identify frequently used Nepali letter styles and formats. The sample consisted of 242 letters collected in 1975 and 204 letters collected in 1980. All letters were assessed by the same evaluator by using a Nepali Letter Evaluation Instrument, which was validated by a jury of judges. The reliability of the instrument was tested by evaluating the same 20 letters at two different time intervals. Twenty-four separate <b>error</b> <b>categories</b> classified as content, language, and mechanics were identified. Statistical comparisons were made assessing errors in each of 24 separate <b>error</b> <b>categories</b> between the 1975 and 1980 samples. Errors occurring in correspondence from different types of organizations were also compared. Eleven null hypotheses were tested by using Chi-square statistics and Fisher's Exact Test. Descriptive data concerning letter styles, formats, and stationery sizes were also evaluated. Based on the findings of the study, the following conclusions were made: (1) The quality of Nepali letters written in 1980 was approximately the same as the quality of those written in 1975. Of the 24 <b>error</b> <b>categories</b> compared, spelling and margin usages in 1980 improved, punctuation usages deteriorated, and the other 21 categories remained the same. (2) Within various type of organizations, letter writers in 1980 made about the same number of errors in their out-going letters as in 1975. Over 85 percent of the <b>error</b> <b>categories</b> remained unchanged. Fewer margin and spacing errors occurred. Punctuation usages deteriorated. Strikeovers and handwritten corrections occurred less frequently in letters from some types of organizations, but deteriorated in letters from other types of organizations. (3) When usage was compared between organizations, <b>error</b> <b>categories</b> differed in more categories than when it was compared within organizations. Some types of errors occurred more frequently in selected organizations. Letter writers from governmental agencies made more errors in their letter writing than writers from other organizations. Letter writers from semi-government corporations committed the next most frequent number of errors. (4) The ten most frequently occurring errors found in Nepali letters collected in 1975 and 1980 were margin errors, spelling errors, very long sentences, strikeovers, inappropriate words, stereotyped language, too many connectives, errors crossed out, and incorrect word-divisions. (5) Compared to content errors, language errors and mechanical errors occurred more frequently. (6) The typical and most frequently used letter style was the simplified style with salutation and complimentary closing omitted. This style also placed the writer's identification either {{in the middle of the}} paper or on the right hand side. Governmental agencies were the largest users of the Simplified letter style. (7) Salutations and complimentary closings were used by writers from banks, other non-profit organizations, and private businesses. The trend in 1980 was toward using salutations and complimentary closings. (8) Letter placement and margins suggested by Nepali typewriting textbooks were not followed by a majority of the Nepali letter writers. Left and right margins were too small and bottom margins were too wide. (9) The sizes of the stationery were widely diversified. The letter placement appeared awkward because of variations in paper size. Recommendations of this study, if implemented, should strengthen training programs for office personnel in Nepal...|$|R
