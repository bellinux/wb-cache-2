5|$|Burial 195 {{was flooded}} with mud in antiquity. This flood had covered wooden objects that had {{completely}} rotted away {{by the time the}} tomb was excavated, leaving <b>hollows</b> in the dried mud. Archaeologists filled these <b>hollows</b> with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god K'awiil, the wooden originals long gone.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{prefer to}} eat seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers and insects. They often feed in large flocks, {{particularly}} when ground-feeding. Cockatoos are monogamous and nest in tree <b>hollows.</b> Some cockatoo {{species have been}} adversely affected by habitat loss, particularly from a shortage of suitable nesting <b>hollows</b> after large mature trees are cleared; conversely, some species have adapted well to human changes and are considered agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock geology of {{the parish}} {{comprises}} rocks formed in the Santonian and Campanian ages of the Cretaceous period and the Eocene age of the Palaeogene period. In places these are overlain by younger Quaternary drift material: river terrace and head deposits, clay-with-flints, and alluvium—the last found only in the valley floors of the larger watercourses. On Puddletown Heath (now mostly covered by Puddletown Forest) are more than 370 solution <b>hollows</b> or sinkholes; these constitute the largest concentration of <b>hollows</b> on the heathlands in the area.|$|E

50|$|York <b>Hollow</b> has one named tributary, {{which is}} known as Schultz <b>Hollow.</b> Schultz <b>Hollow</b> joins York <b>Hollow</b> 0.96 mi {{upstream}} of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of 0.43 sq mi.|$|R
5|$|Nest {{sites are}} varied, though {{cavities}} are preferred. Nests {{are most frequently}} built in the eaves and other crevices of houses. Holes in cliffs and banks, or tree <b>hollows,</b> are also used. A sparrow sometimes excavates its own nests in sandy banks or rotten branches, but more frequently uses the nests of other birds {{such as those of}} swallows in banks and cliffs, and old tree cavity nests. It usually uses deserted nests, though sometimes it usurps active ones. Tree <b>hollows</b> are more commonly used in North America than in Europe, putting the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other North American cavity nesters, and thereby contributing to their population declines.|$|E
5|$|The Khoikhoi herders {{produced}} the geometric imagery, probably depicting herder groups. They {{are also the}} creators of the more worldly indentations in that area that served as grinding <b>hollows</b> and game boards. Some of the stones bear marks from use as gong stones; they make unusual sounds when hit.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon and little eagle {{have been reported}} taking galahs and the wedge-tailed eagle has been observed killing a sulphur-crested cockatoo. Eggs and nestlings are vulnerable to many hazards. Various species of monitor lizard (Varanus) are able to climb trees and enter <b>hollows.</b> Other predators recorded include the spotted wood owl on Rasa Island in the Philippines; the amethystine python, black butcherbird and rodents including the giant white-tailed rat in Cape York; and brushtail possum on Kangaroo Island. Furthermore, galahs and little corellas competing for nesting space with the glossy black cockatoo on Kangaroo Island have been recorded killing nestlings of the latter species there. Severe storms may also flood <b>hollows</b> drowning the young and termite or borer activity {{may lead to the}} internal collapse of nests.|$|E
30|$|Overall, {{autograft}} {{performed better}} compared with both conduit groups. Differences in axonal diameter were significant (autograft > <b>hollow</b> conduit > collagen-filled conduit) at 13  weeks (autograft vs. <b>hollow</b> conduit, p[*]=[*] 0.001, and <b>hollow</b> conduit vs. collagen-filled conduit, p[*]<[*] 0.001). Significant group {{differences were found}} for axial diffusivity but not {{for any of the}} other DTI metrics (autograft > <b>hollow</b> conduit > collagen-filled conduit) (autograft vs. <b>hollow</b> conduit, p[*]=[*] 0.001 and <b>hollow</b> conduit vs. collagen-filled conduit, p[*]=[*] 0.021). As compared with <b>hollow</b> conduit (autograft > collagen-filled conduit > <b>hollow</b> conduit), collagen-filled conduit animals demonstrated a nonsignificant increased maximum tetanic force.|$|R
50|$|Panther <b>Hollow</b> is {{a wooded}} valley in Schenley Park (adjacent to Panther <b>Hollow)</b> that runs {{within the park}} west to east {{approximately}} 1.5 miles, beginning at Boundary Street in Junction <b>Hollow</b> and ending near Hobart Street in Squirrel Hill. (Thus, curiously, the neighborhood of Panther <b>Hollow</b> lies not within the valley of Panther <b>Hollow</b> itself, but rather in Junction <b>Hollow.)</b> The <b>hollow</b> features the man-made Panther <b>Hollow</b> Lake, on {{the east end of}} which is the confluence of Panther <b>Hollow</b> Run (which generally follows the valley) and Phipps Run. Created in the 1880s, Panther <b>Hollow</b> Lake was once the center of a busy picnic and recreational area that included a boat house adjacent to the lake from which couples could rent boats for an afternoon. The boathouse was razed in the 1930s. Today, hiking trails follow both streams.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{discharge}} of RF <b>hollow</b> cathode far zone plasma has advantages of high ion concentration, easy {{to implement the}} processing of a large area, given more and more attention. The characteristics of <b>hollow</b> cathode plasma flow have a great relationship with the <b>hollow</b> cathode nozzle structure. How to design the <b>hollow</b> cathode nozzle discharge structure accurately and conveniently is the key problem of the <b>hollow</b> cathode far plasma surface treatment. This article builds a <b>hollow</b> cathode plasma discharge self-consistent model; derive {{the relationship between the}} discharge current of the <b>hollow</b> cathode plasma and the <b>hollow</b> cathode nozzle structure. Optimize the design of the <b>hollow</b> cathode discharge structure using discharge particle simulation software, to achieve a fast and accurate design and the purpose of efficient plasma surface modification...|$|R
5|$|The skull {{is unknown}} except for {{possibly}} {{a portion of}} lower jaw found at the same site {{as the rest of}} the known Coelurus material. Although it has the same preservation and coloring as the fossils known to belong to the Coelurus skeleton, it is very slender, which may mean it does not belong to the skeleton; this bone is 7.9centimeters long (3.1in) but only 1.1centimeters tall (0.43in). In general, its vertebrae were long and low, with low neural spines and thin walls to the bodies of the vertebrae. Its neck vertebrae were very pneumatic, with numerous hollow spaces on their surfaces (pleurocoels); these <b>hollows</b> were not evenly distributed among the vertebrae and varied in size. The neck vertebrae were very elongate, with bodies four times longer than wide, and they articulated with concave faces on both ends (amphicoely). The back vertebrae were not as elongate, lacked surface <b>hollows,</b> and had less developed concave faces and bodies that were hourglass-shaped. The tail vertebrae also lacked surface <b>hollows.</b>|$|E
5|$|Additional key {{threatening}} {{processes that}} are considered likely to impact the bristle-faced free-tailed bat include the alteration to natural flow regimes, competition from introduced western honey bees (Apis mellifera) for tree <b>hollows,</b> inappropriate fire regimes, reduction of invertebrate prey related to pesticide drift and lack of tree regeneration due to overgrazing and weeds.|$|E
5|$|Around 56% of eggs lead to {{successful}} fledging of young, with fieldwork in northeastern Victoria yielding {{an average of}} 2.77 young leaving the nest. The lace monitor (Varanus varius) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) are nest predators. Baby birds may perish by overheating in very hot weather, or by being drowned in the <b>hollows</b> after heavy rain.|$|E

5|$|Caddisflies {{are best}} known for the {{portable}} cases created by their larvae. About thirty families of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, adopt this stratagem. These larvae eat detritus, largely decaying vegetable material, and the dead leaf fragments on which they feed tend to accumulate in <b>hollows,</b> in slow-moving sections of streams and behind stones and tree roots. The cases provide protection to the larvae as they make their way between these resources.|$|E
5|$|Cairanoolithus dughii is {{the type}} oospecies. At , its eggshell is {{slightly}} thicker than that of C. roussetensis. It has slender, partially fused columnar eggshell units. Their outer surface is almost without ornamentation, and the inner surface is covered with <b>hollows</b> once filled by organic cores. C. dughiis eggshell exhibits an angusticanaliculate pore system, i.e. its pores are long, narrow, and straight.|$|E

5|$|Nests may be {{protected}} from physical threats such as flooding and overheating by elaborate nest architecture. Workers of Cataulacus muticus, an arboreal species that lives in plant <b>hollows,</b> respond to flooding by drinking water inside the nest, and excreting it outside. Camponotus anderseni, which nests in the cavities of wood in mangrove habitats, deals with submergence under water by switching to anaerobic respiration.|$|E
5|$|The Paramhamsa monks, who are loners, are to {{be found}} in deserted houses, in temples, straw huts, on ant hills, sitting under a tree, on sand beds near rivers, in {{mountain}} caves, near waterfalls, in <b>hollows</b> inside trees, or in wide open fields. The Upanishad states that these loners have advanced far in their path of reaching Brahman – they are pure in mind, they are the Paramahamsas.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season {{varies according to}} latitude, taking place from April to July in Queensland, January to May in northern New South Wales, December to February in southern New South Wales, and October to February in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The male yellow-tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up crest and spreading his tail feathers to display his yellow plumage. Softly growling, he approaches the female and bows {{three or four times}} to her. His eye ring may also flush a deeper pink. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree <b>hollows</b> of tall trees, generally eucalypts, which are either living or dead. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. A 1994 study of nesting sites in Eucalyptus regnans forest in the Strzelecki Ranges in eastern Victoria found the average age of trees used for <b>hollows</b> by the yellow-tailed black cockatoo to be 228 years. The authors noted that the proposed 80–150 year rotation time for managed forests would impact on the numbers of suitable trees.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Hollow</b> Trees {{were formed}} in 2004 in Los Angeles by singer and guitar player Gregory <b>Hollow</b> Tree with upright bass player Laura <b>Hollow</b> Tree.

50|$|A <b>Hollow</b> fiber {{bioreactor}} is a 3D cell culturing {{system based}} on <b>hollow</b> fibers, which are small, semi-permeable capillary membranes arranged in parallel array with a typical molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) range of 10-30 kDa. These <b>hollow</b> fiber membranes are often bundled and housed within tubular polycarbonate shells to create <b>hollow</b> fiber bioreactor cartridges. Within the cartridges, which are also fitted with inlet and outlet ports, are two compartments: the intracapillary (IC) space within the <b>hollow</b> fibers, and the extracapillary (EC) space surrounding the <b>hollow</b> fibers.|$|R
40|$|The pure anatase TiO 2 <b>hollow</b> {{microspheres}} are synthesized by a one-step template-free hydrothermal route. By defining {{temperature and}} time limits, we produce TiO 2 <b>hollow</b> microspheres with a fluoride-mediated self-transformation. The surface morphology of TiO 2 <b>hollow</b> microspheres was studied by SEM. The <b>hollow</b> microspheres have diameters of about 800  nm and are remarkably uniform. The UV-light photocatalytic {{activity and the}} stability/multifunction of TiO 2 <b>hollow</b> microspheres structure were evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The excellent photocatalytic activity is attributed to large specific surface area, more active sites, unique <b>hollow</b> structures, and improved light scattering.

5|$|The male red-tailed black {{cockatoo}} courts by puffing up crest and cheek feathers, {{and hiding}} the beak; it then sings and struts, {{ending in a}} jump and a flash of red tail feathers toward the female who will most often reply by defensively biting him. Breeding generally takes place from May to September except {{in the case of}} the South-eastern subspecies, which nests during summer (December to February). Pairs of the subspecies samueli in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia may produce two broods, while those of South-eastern subspecies only produce one. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree <b>hollows</b> of tall trees. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. <b>Hollows</b> can be 1 to 2metres (3–7ft) deep and 0.25–0.5metres (10–20in) wide, with a base of woodchips. A clutch consists of 1 to 2 white, lustreless eggs, although the second chick is in most cases neglected and perishes in infancy.|$|E
5|$|Upon exiting Elk Township, Kettle Creek enters Abbott Township, Potter County. It heads southwest, passing Bear Run Ridge, Rawson Ridge, Big Ridge, {{and several}} <b>hollows,</b> also picking up several small tributaries along the way. After a few miles, it enters Stewardson Township. Its course {{takes on a}} west-southwest {{direction}} and it passes by the community of Oleona, where it picks up the tributary Little Kettle Creek. It also begins paralleling Pennsylvania Route 144 at this point. Kettle Creek then makes a sharp turn to the south-southwest. The course soon resumes its southwestern direction, passing through Ole Bull State Park. The creek passes Keeney Mountain and several more <b>hollows</b> before turning west-northwest briefly {{to pick up the}} tributary Cross Fork in the southwestern reaches of Stewardson Township. The creek then turns southwest again and leaves the township.|$|E
5|$|Both The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle were {{produced}} in co-operation with Emelka Film Studios in Munich, Germany. The film was mostly shot at Emelka in Munich {{in the fall}} of 1925, and the film exteriors were shot on location in Obergurgl, in what is now the municipality of Sölden in the State of Tyrol in southwestern Austria, the Ötztal Alps standing in for the mountains and <b>hollows</b> of Kentucky. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom than he would have had in England, and influences in the technique and style of German cinema are evident in his early works.|$|E
