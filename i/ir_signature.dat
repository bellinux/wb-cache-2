[...] Artificial intelligence software combines these features to locate enemy ships and avoid neutral shipping in crowded areas. [...] Automatic dissemination of emissions data is classified, located, and identified for path of attack; the data-link allows other assets to feed the missile a real-time electronic picture of the enemy battlespace. [...] Multiple missiles can work together to share data to coordinate an attack in a swarm. [...] Aside from short, low-power data-link transmissions, the LRASM does not emit signals, which combined with the low-RCS JASSM airframe and low <b>IR</b> <b>signature</b> reduces detectability. [...] Unlike previous radar-only seeker-equipped missiles that went on to hit other vessels if diverted or decoyed, the multi-mode seeker ensures the correct target is hit in a specific area of the ship.

50|$|An {{exhaust plume}} {{contributes}} a significant infrared signature. The F-117 reduces <b>IR</b> <b>signature</b> with a non-circular tail pipe (a slit shape) {{to minimize the}} exhaust cross-sectional volume and maximize the mixing of hot exhaust with cool ambient air. The F-117 lacks afterburners, because the hot exhaust would increase the infrared signature, and breaking the sound barrier would produce an obvious sonic boom, as well as surface heating of the aircraft skin which also increases the infrared footprint. As a result, its performance in air combat maneuvering required in a dogfight would never match that of a dedicated fighter aircraft.

5000|$|When {{engaging}} slow or straight-receding targets, {{the operator}} tracks the target with the iron sights in the launch tube and applies half-trigger.

If a target <b>IR</b> <b>signature</b> can be tracked against the background present, this is indicated by a light and a buzzer sound. The shooter then pulls the trigger fully, and immediately applies lead and superelevation. This method is called a manual engagement. An automatic mode, which is used against fast targets, allows the shooter to fully depress the trigger in one pull followed by immediate lead and superelevation of the launch tube. The seeker will uncage and will automatically launch the missile if a strong enough signal is detected.|$|E

Visible pyrometry monitored the temperature history of the particles and infrared detectors quantified the <b>IR</b> <b>signatures</b> at several wavelengths. Data analysis gave values of the imaginary refractive index, k. As the particles cooled to submelt temperatures (1600 to 2300 K), the values of k remained near 0. 1, comparable to the liquid values and several orders of magnitude larger than those for bulk alpha-Al 2 O 3. This results in an enhancement of SWIR radiation by three or more orders of magnitude. These results give strong evidence that a rapid-cooling solidification process is primarily responsible for discrepancies between observed and predicted radiation in SRM tests...|$|R
50|$|A key {{attribute}} of fifth-generation fighters {{is a small}} radar cross-section. Great care has been taken in designing its layout and internal structure to minimize RCS over a broad bandwidth of detection and tracking radar frequencies; furthermore, to maintain its VLO signature during combat operations, primary weapons are carried in internal weapon bays that are only briefly opened to permit weapon launch. Furthermore, stealth technology has advanced {{to the point where}} it can be employed without a tradeoff with aerodynamics performance, in contrast to previous stealth efforts. Some attention has also been paid to reducing <b>IR</b> <b>signatures,</b> especially on the F-22. Detailed information on these signature-reduction techniques is classified, but in general includes special shaping approaches, thermoset and thermoplastic materials, extensive structural use of advanced composites, conformal sensors, heat-resistant coatings, low-observable wire meshes to cover intake and cooling vents, heat ablating tiles on the exhaust troughs (seen on the Northrop YF-23), and coating internal and external metal areas with radar-absorbent materials and paint (RAM/RAP).|$|R
40|$|Radar, IR, and photogeologic {{properties}} of some 1310 lunar craters {{that have been}} catalogued as radar or IR anomalies, or both, are studied {{to determine whether a}} systematic difference in blocky craters exists between the lunar maria and terrae and whether this difference might be caused by a deep magaregolith of pulverized material forming the terra surface. Examination of Apollo orbital photography confirms that the radar and IR anomalies are correlated with blocky rubble around the craters, and analysis of the radar and IR data indicates systematic terra-mare differences. The data are interpreted by postulating that the maria are rock layers where craters eject boulder fields, that the terrae are covered by a relatively pulverized megaregolith at least 2 km deep, and that the terra craters eject less rocky rubble. It is concluded that blocky rubble, in the form of either actual rocks or partly consolidated blocks, contributes to the radar and <b>IR</b> <b>signatures</b> of the craters...|$|R
50|$|The POST has a dual-detector seeker: IR and UV. This {{allows it}} to {{distinguish}} targets from countermeasures {{much better than the}} Redeye and FIM-92A, which have IR-only. While modern flares can have an <b>IR</b> <b>signature</b> that is closely matched to the launching aircraft's engine exhaust, there is a readily distinguishable difference in UV signature between flares and jet engines. The Stinger-RMP is so-called because of its ability to load a new set of software via ROM chip inserted in the grip at the depot. If this download to the missile fails during power-up, basic functionality runs off the on-board ROM. The four-processor RMP has 4 KB of RAM for each processor.

50|$|An {{exhaust plume}} {{contributes}} a significant infrared signature. One means to reduce <b>IR</b> <b>signature</b> {{is to have}} a non-circular tail pipe (a slit shape) to minimize the exhaust cross-sectional volume and maximize the mixing of hot exhaust with cool ambient air (see Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk). Often, cool air is deliberately injected into the exhaust flow to boost this process (see Ryan AQM-91 Firefly and Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit). Sometimes, the jet exhaust is vented above the wing surface to shield it from observers below, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, and the unstealthy Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. To achieve infrared stealth, the exhaust gas is cooled to the temperatures where the brightest wavelengths it radiates are absorbed by atmospheric carbon dioxide and water vapor, dramatically reducing the infrared visibility of the exhaust plume. Another way to reduce the exhaust temperature is to circulate coolant fluids such as fuel inside the exhaust pipe, where the fuel tanks serve as heat sinks cooled by the flow of air along the wings.|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} and the theoretical interests for the silicon chemistry have been renewed {{by the recent}} detection of SiN in space. In this contribution a theoretical study of the HSiN, HNSi, HSiNH 2 and HNSiH 2 molecular systems is presented that aims {{to help in the}} interpretation of available experimental results {{as well as in the}} attribution of new interstellar lines. The main goal of this report remains, however, the calibration of ab initio calculations on still-unknown silicon-nitrogen systems: the infrared and the microwave signatures of the HSiNH+ cation are reported as a direct application. The signatures of the five molecules under investagation have been computed at increasing levels of post-Hartree-Fock theories, using up to a 6 – 311 + + G** atomic orbital expansion. Accurate geometries and Be rotational constants have been determined at the Möller-Plesset MPn(n = 2, 3, 4), CASSCF and CCSD(T) theoretical plateaus for HNSi. The comparison with experimental data allows then to derive the scaling factors needed to obtain accurate rotational constants for related species: they are applied as such on the crude constants determined for HSiN, HSiNH 2, HNSiH 2, and finally HSiNH 2 in its floppy linear singlet ground state and in its lowest cis-bent a 3 A' state as well. Dipole moments are reported in order to assess the feasability for these species to be detected owing to their rotational signatures either in the laboratory or in space using millimetric radioastronomy techniques. Infrared (<b>IR)</b> <b>signatures</b> are computed at the same levels of theory and compared to the recent matrix isolation experiments devoted to HSiN, HNSi, HSiNH 2 and HNSiH 2. The calculations unambiguosly confirm that all these species have been effectively produced and observed. They also lead to the determination of accurate IR scaling factors that are significantly larger than the usual ones. Such an approach allows then to quantitatively predict the IR spectra of the still-unknown HSiNH+ entity. The study of the IR spectra furthermore points out the failure of single-reference correlation methods to obtain predictive <b>IR</b> <b>signatures</b> in some cases, as is unambigously illustrated in the case of the HSiN species...|$|R

40|$|Part of {{the task}} of {{interpreting}} IR spectral features observed by MGS/TES due to surface minerals requires distinguishing those <b>IR</b> <b>signatures</b> from atmospheric signatures of gas and dust. Surface-atmosphere separation for MGS/TES depends on knowledge of the retrieved temperature profile. In turn, the temperature retrieval Erom the observed data depends on molecular parameters including 15 micron CO 2 line shape or line intensities which contribute to defining the Mars synthetic radiative transfer model. Using a simple isothermal, homogeneous single layer model of Pinnock and Shine, we find the ratio of (the error in degrees Kelvin of the retrieved temperature profile) to (the percentage error in the absorption coefficient) (deg K/percent) to be 0. 4 at 200 K. This ratio at 150 K and 250 K is 0. 2 and 0. 6, respectively.
