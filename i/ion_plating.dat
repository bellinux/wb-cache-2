50|$|In <b>ion</b> <b>plating</b> the energy, flux {{and mass}} of the bombarding species along with the ratio of bombarding {{particles}} to depositing particles are important processing variables. The depositing material may be vaporized either by evaporation, sputtering (bias sputtering), arc vaporization or by decomposition of a chemical vapor precursor chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The energetic particles used for bombardment are usually ions of an inert or reactive gas, or, in some cases, ions of the condensing film material (“film ions”). <b>Ion</b> <b>plating</b> {{can be done in}} a plasma environment where ions for bombardment are extracted from the plasma or it may be done in a vacuum environment where ions for bombardment are formed in a separate ion gun. The latter <b>ion</b> <b>plating</b> configuration is often called Ion Beam Assisted Deposition (IBAD). By using a reactive gas or vapor in the plasma, films of compound materials can be deposited.|$|E

As {{a result the}} adherence, coherence, internal stresses, and morphology of the films are significantly improved. Gold <b>ion</b> <b>plated</b> films because of their graded coating/substrate interface and fine uniform densely packed microstructure not only improve the tribological properties but also induce a surface strengthening effect which improves the mechanical properties such as yield, tensile, and fatigue strength. Consequently significant improvements in the tribological performance of <b>ion</b> <b>plated</b> gold films as compared to vapor deposited gold films are shown in terms of decreased friction/wear and prolonged endurance life...|$|R

50|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>plating</b> (IP) is a {{physical}} vapor deposition (PVD) process that is sometimes called ion assisted deposition (IAD) or ion vapor deposition (IVD) and is a version of vacuum deposition. <b>Ion</b> <b>plating</b> uses concurrent or periodic bombardment of the substrate, and deposits film by atomic-sized energetic particles. Bombardment prior to deposition is used to sputter clean the substrate surface. During deposition the bombardment is used to modify and control {{the properties of the}} depositing film. It is important that the bombardment be continuous between the cleaning and the deposition portions of the process to maintain an atomically clean interface.|$|E
5000|$|Sputter {{cleaning}} is {{the cleaning}} {{of a solid}} surface in a vacuum by using physical sputtering of the surface. Sputter cleaning is often used in vacuum deposition and <b>ion</b> <b>plating.</b> In 1955 Farnsworth, Schlier, George, and Burger reported using sputter cleaning in an ultra-high-vacuum system to prepare ultra-clean surfaces for low-energy electron-diffraction (LEED) studies. [...] Sputter cleaning became {{an integral part of}} the <b>ion</b> <b>plating</b> process. Sputter cleaning has some potential problems such as overheating, gas incorporation in the surface region, bombardment (radiation) damage in the surface region, and the roughening of the surface, particularly if over done. It is important to have a clean plasma in order to not continually recontaminate the surface during sputter cleaning. Redeposition of sputtered material on the substrate can also give problems, especially at high sputtering pressures.|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to summarize in a concise review the solid lubricant film structure and morphology and their effects on the tribological properties of the lubricant systems. The tribological performance of thin lubricating films has significantly advanced through progressive understanding of the film parameters such as adhesion, cohesion, interface formation, nucleation and microstructural growth, critical film thickness and substrate finish, and temperature.

40|$|A Hertzian {{analysis}} {{of the effect of}} sliding friction on contact stresses in alumina is used to predict the critical load for crack generation. The results for uncoated alumina and alumina coated with <b>ion</b> <b>plated</b> silver are compared. Friction coefficient inputs to the analysis are determined experimentally with a scratch test instrument employing an 0. 2 mm radius diamond stylus. A series of scratches were made at constant load increments on coated and uncoated flat alumina surfaces. Critical loads for cracking are detected by microscopic examination of cross sections of scratches made at various loads and friction coefficients. Acoustic emission (AE) and friction trends were also evaluated as experimental techniques for determining critical loads for cracking. Analytical predictions correlate well with micrographic evidence and with the lowest load at which AE is detected in multiple scratch tests. Friction/load trends are not good indicators of early crack formation.
