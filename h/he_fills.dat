The group then begin wrecking the bar, smashing the fixtures, mirrors, and breaking the cash register. The bartender then sprays seltzer water in Nation's face before a group of policemen appear and order everybody to leave.|$|E

500|$|In Frank's backstory, he is {{a product}} of a broken home, born to a {{criminal}} father and an alcoholic mother. His father was sent to prison and his mother became incapable of looking after him. As a result, Frank became wayward, but that changed after he was fostered by Pippa and Tom. Frank's ethnicity is Greek Australian; and <b>he</b> <b>fills</b> the role of the serial's first heart-throb. He is characterised as having [...] "streetwise ways" [...] and a [...] "disarming smile". Frank has rock and roll ambitions because he has never been academically successful. He faced hardship to get through school. Frank only just managed to pass his exams into Year 10. However, his ambitions are reachable as the [...] "only thing" [...] he is good at is playing the guitar. Frank wants to get a job and form his own band.|$|E
500|$|Before {{he was a}} full 36 {{calendar}} months old, [...] Mucho Macho Man contested {{all three}} legs of the American Triple Crown. He finished third to Animal Kingdom and Nehro in the Kentucky Derby. He was described as having a [...] "babyish look" [...] prior to the Derby, and Ritvo {{said that he was}} still growing, but Stevens noted during the Derby's television broadcast, [...] "when <b>he</b> <b>fills</b> into this frame, he's going to be a big, powerful horse." [...] Mucho Macho Man was sixth behind Shackleford in the Preakness. At the start, he again tore off a shoe, this time from his left front hoof, even though Ritvo had switched him to glued-on horseshoes. The misstep may have accounted for his low placing. [...] Before the Belmont, Ritvo brought in a farrier specialist, who gave the horse custom made glued-on horseshoes made of a wire-framed synthetic composite and who also squared off the toes of Mucho Macho Man's hind shoes to make it harder for him to accidentally step on his front heels. [...] At the Belmont, Ramon Dominguez took over from Maragh as the colt's jockey, and went on to ride him for a total of five races. That day, the track was sloppy and the horse ran seventh behind winner Ruler on Ice. After the Belmont, he did not race for several months because he needed surgery to fix a problem with his breathing.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{spent the}} 193738 {{season with the}} Colts and won the team's batting trophy for having the best average; he made 340 runs at 42.50. Across the entire competition, Miller had the eighth highest average. He scored three half-centuries and a 102 against Northcote.Perry, p. 32. At this stage, Miller was a solid, slow and steady batsman, who {{accumulated}} his runs gradually, but The Age predicted that his physical growth would open his horizons, opining [...] "Once <b>he</b> <b>fills</b> outhe is rather tall for his weightMiller should become a brilliant, aggressive batsman".Perry, p. 31. In early February 1938, late in the summer, he made his first-class debut for Victoria as an 18-year-old and hit 181 in 289 minutes against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. With his increased power, Miller began to loft the ball over the infield and struck five fours. During the 193839 season, he rejoined South Melbourne and played four first-class matches for Victoria, scoring 125 runs {{at an average of}} 25.00. However, Miller was yet to play in the Sheffield Shield competition, only taking to the field in one-off matches against other teams. In the two matches against Tasmania in December 1938, Miller took his first catch, but managed only four, seven not out and three, and he spent a period of time outside the team. Miller was recalled in March 1939late in the seasonfor two matches against Western Australia in Perth, scoring 111 runs at 37.00, notching his first first-class fifty of the season in the second innings of the first match.|$|E

500|$|Gwen Stacy's Spider-Woman is {{depicted}} as harboring much of Earth-616 Peter's personality and conflicts, such as receiving negative media attention of herself and having the conflict of being a superheroine over her normal life of a band member. Critical commentary noted her as a sarcastic, wisecracking heroine when fighting criminals and supervillains. Spider-Gwen (Vol. 2) #1's summary of the character reveals that she originally used her powers for attention. After advice expressed to Gwen Stacy by her father that Spider-Woman could use her powers for good purposes, she was motivated to stop bullying, which Peter Parker in Earth-65 was a victim of. Spider-Woman eventually became an idol to Peter and he used an experimentation on himself to become a superhero like her, leading to his demise. Gwen Stacy was branded a criminal after Peter's death, having been blamed for killing him. Jesse Schedeen of IGN felt that this aspect was the most intriguing change of her story, [...] " [...] both Gwen's first major villain and the defining, Uncle-Ben-style tragedy in her life." [...] Evan Narcisse from Kotaku explained {{that it was a}} role reversal that felt [...] "enriching" [...] to what the creators attended to do, which gave Gwen Stacy [...] "a reason to live". After saving her father's life and revealing her identity to him, she vows to use her powers to stop crime. Captain Stacy is then depicted as choosing his daughter over his job. Meagan Damore of Comic Book Resources opined that even though Captain Stacy is no Uncle Ben, <b>he</b> <b>fills</b> the wise mentor role for Gwen very well.|$|E
500|$|Though {{a modern}} {{synopsis}} {{has not been}} published, the original synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World on December 3, 1910. It states: [...] "Captain Smith sails away on his vessel for a trip around South America, through the Pacific, leaving behind him his wife and little girl, whom he dearly loves. The ship is reported lost with all on board, {{with the exception of}} a cabin boy who is picked up in mid ocean. The captain's wife struggles to support her child, but owing to a rapidly failing health she fights a losing battle with poverty. One by one her valued possessions find their way to the pawnshop, where the kind-hearted old pawnbroker, Levy, becomes interested in the sad-faced woman and pretty child, who never seem able to redeem any of their possessions. The last article of value left in Mrs. Smith's possession is her wedding ring, and Levy refuses to take this. Instead he offers her help, which the widow proudly refuses. She insists that she can go out and get work. Levy, seeing that he can help in no other way, offers to care for little Marie, and to this the mother finally gives her consent. Half in jest, Levy gives the mother a pawn ticket for the little girl, which <b>he</b> <b>fills</b> out to read that 'a precious jewel, a value beyond price,' has been left with him and can be redeemed 'at any time.' The mother leaves the little one in Levy's care and upon reaching home and finding herself mortally stricken, she puts the pawn ticket he has given her in an envelope which she entrusts to a friendly janitoress, to be given into no other hands than those of her husband should it be that he is not dead.|$|E
500|$|Webb {{felt that}} the Lizard was the best villain because, [...] "He's the literal {{embodiment}} of {{the theme of the}} movie, which is we all have a missing piece. He has no arm. Peter has no parents, and <b>he</b> <b>fills</b> that void with Spider-Man." [...] Producer Avi Arad felt likewise, explaining, [...] "ou look at Peter, he misses the parents, [...] Connors has one arm. ...motionally, [...] is a very similar problem. It is a cautionary tale." [...] Webb said that the Lizard [...] "is not the worst villain on the planet. He's not a mustache-twirling guy who wants to terrorize people. He believes he's doing the right thing." [...] Actor Rhys Ifans described his character as a flawed character comparable to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. [...] "Curt Connors is by no means an evil villain," [...] Ifans stated. [...] "He's not like the Batman villains, like the Joker, who are the embodiment of evil. Curtis Connors is a great man who makes a bad decision. ... hat's the whole magic of the Spider-Man idea. These people are the embodiment of our flaws and our desires that lead to tragedy." [...] Ifans described Connors as a force for good throughout his life: [...] "He's a geneticist who wants to help people, like him, who are limbless. In his eagerness to advance that science, he makes a mistake and that's an occurrence we've seen throughout time, sometimes to our benefit, sometimes to our detriment." [...] "...He is a broken man who wants to fix himself." [...] Ifans added, [...] "I'm not portraying a villain in any sense. Connors does feel cheated by God, and he's looking for answers in science. God seems to intervene." ...|$|E

[...] About Laughton, the reviewer said, [...] "Let me not be afraid to use superlatives" [...] and then proceeded to detail why he held the view he did, concluding, [...] "He seizes the stage and firmly controls the audience. <b>He</b> <b>fills</b> me {{with a sense of}} his power, and makes me intensely aware of him from the moment he comes on to the stage until the moment he leaves it.

[...] Slant magazine's Jesse Cataldo who said [...] "Shock Value II is a vanity project, the kind of bonus fluff {{that you can get}} away with releasing when you're as famous and respected as Timbaland. [...] To be fair, Timbaland is not a terrible rapper. His clumsy flow is no worse than Diddy's jittery streams of twaddle, but it's just as annoying. The tendency here, whether intentional or not, is to surround himself with mediocre talent rather than the titans who he helped make superstars [...] The overall laziness of that facet is even more inexcusable coming from one of the most renowned producers of the last decade.". The most positive review comes from USA Today, Steve Jones says [...] "He misses occasionally on this 17-track opus, but he's mainly on target with his jolts to the eardrums." ...|$|E
