Beyond lies Carvannel Downs with Samphire Island {{just off the}} coast, and then the Reskajeage Downs better known locally as the North Cliffs. Beyond the cove at Hell's Mouth, the path runs northwards to pass around Navax Point and Godrevy Point, {{offshore}} from which lies Godrevy Island with its lighthouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarine}} {{is ordered}} to destroy Atlantis but Bond insists on rescuing Amasova first. He confronts and kills Stromberg but again encounters Jaws, whom he <b>drops</b> <b>into</b> a shark tank. However, Jaws kills the shark and escapes. Bond and Amasova flee in an escape pod as Atlantis is sunk. Amasova reminds Bond {{that she has}} vowed to kill him as she picks up Bond's gun. Then, she admits to having forgiven him and the two embrace. The Royal Navy recovers the pod and the two spies are seen in an intimate embrace through its port window, much to the bemusement of their superiors on the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{video game}} Myst {{tells the story}} of a special book which serves as a link to a world known as Myst. Myst is the home of an {{explorer}} named Atrus, who lives on the island with his wife Catherine and two sons, Sirrus and Achenar. An unnamed protagonist <b>drops</b> <b>into</b> Myst and finds the island strangely deserted. As the player explores Myst, they discover Sirrus and Achenar trapped inside two books. Both swear that their parents are dead due to the machinations of the other brother, and instruct the player to repair their books so they can be freed. In truth, Atrus and Catherine are merely imprisoned, and both Sirrus and Achenar are guilty of growing power-hungry and destroying Atrus' books. The player frees Atrus, leading to the events of the sequel Riven.|$|E

5|$|Another {{featured}} preliminary match involved Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho in a singles match. At Backlash, Michaels defeated Batista (with Jericho as {{the special}} guest referee) in an Interpromotional match. During the match, Michaels countered a Batista Bomb attempt, a powerbomb move {{in which the}} wrestler <b>drops</b> <b>into</b> a sitting position as they slam their opponent down to the mat, and appeared to have legitimately injured his left knee. On the April 28 episode of Raw, Jericho claimed that Michaels faked his knee injury {{to allow him to}} defeat Batista at Backlash, a claim that Michaels denied. The following week, it was announced that Jericho would face Michaels in a singles match at Judgment Day. On the May 12 episode of Raw, Jericho offered his apologies to Michaels for accusing him of feigning an injury, as well as giving Michaels the opportunity to back out of their match. Michaels revealed that he did indeed fake his knee injury. Four days later, on the May 16 episode of SmackDown, Batista commented that he would hurt Michaels, scripted into the storyline, for faking his injury.|$|E
5|$|The walrus {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the religion and folklore of many Arctic peoples. Skin and bone are used in some ceremonies, and the animal appears frequently in legends. For example, in a Chukchi version of the widespread myth of the Raven, in which Raven recovers the sun and the moon from an evil spirit by seducing his daughter, the angry father throws the daughter from a high cliff and, as she <b>drops</b> <b>into</b> the water, she turns into a walrus â€“ possibly the original walrus. According to various legends, the tusks are formed either by the trails of mucus from the weeping girl or her long braids. This myth is possibly related to the Chukchi myth of the old walrus-headed woman who rules the bottom of the sea, who is in turn linked to the Inuit goddess Sedna. Both in Chukotka and Alaska, the aurora borealis is believed to be a special world inhabited by those who died by violence, the changing rays representing deceased souls playing ball with a walrus head.|$|E

25|$|Coastal {{demersal}} fish are found {{on or near}} the seabed of coastal waters between the shoreline and the edge of the continental shelf, where the shelf <b>drops</b> <b>into</b> the deep ocean. Since the continental shelf is generally less than 200 metres deep, this means that coastal waters are generally epipelagic. The term includes demersal reef fish and {{demersal fish}} that inhabit estuaries, inlets and bays.|$|E
25|$|When casting is complete, {{the mold}} disk turns {{three-quarters of a}} turn {{counterclockwise}} to the ejector and knife block assembly. The ejector is a rectangular rod that pushes the completed slug from the mold aperture in the mold disk. As it emerges from the mold disk, the slug passes a set of knife edges in the knife block, which trims off any small irregularities in the casting and produces a slug of exactly the desired width and height. From there, the slug <b>drops</b> <b>into</b> the galley tray which holds the lines in {{the order in which}} they were cast.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{designs of}} {{mailboxes}} with improved construction and security have been patented in recent years, {{particularly in the}} United States. In 2001, the USPS first approved designs for locking curbside mailboxes to stem a rise in identity and mail theft. With these secure designs, the incoming mail is placed into a slot or hopper by the mail carrier, where it <b>drops</b> <b>into</b> a secure locked compartment for retrieval by only the homeowner (who retains a key or combination to the lock). Locking mailboxes are generally constructed of heavy-gauge steel or aluminum plate, though some models are made of roto-moulded polymer plastic.|$|E

25|$|The {{edge of the}} {{continental}} shelf marks the boundary where the shelf gives way to, and then gradually <b>drops</b> <b>into</b> abyssal depths. This edge marks the boundary between coastal, relatively shallow, benthic habitats, and the deep benthic habitats. Coastal demersal fishes live {{on the bottom of}} inshore waters, such as bays and estuaries, and further out, on the floor of {{the continental}} shelf. Deep water demersal fish live beyond this edge, mostly down the continental slopes and along the continental rises which drop to the abyssal plains. This is the continental margin, constituting about 28% of the total oceanic area. Other deep sea demersal fish can also be found around seamounts and islands.|$|E
25|$|Past the Baldwin Road exit {{a half-mile}} north of Underhill, the Taconic curves westward {{along the south}} side of Mohansic Lake. When the road returns to a northerly course, an exit allows {{entrance}} to Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park. It is followed by the Crompond Road (U.S. Route202 or US202 and NY35) exit, which serves Peekskill to the west as well as Yorktown. Just beyond it Bear Mountain Parkway, a legacy of the Taconic's original planned route and purpose, leaves to the west as the road <b>drops</b> <b>into</b> a wide valley carved by a tributary of the Hudson, the first place where the road begins to respond to the increasing relief of the landscape.|$|E
25|$|The curtain rises on a girl's bedroom. The Young Girl {{comes into}} the room dressed in a white bonnet and ball gown. She has {{returned}} to her home after her first ball.

He steps to the floor and nears The Young Girl. Still asleep, she rises and dances with him. He leads her back to the chair, kisses her, then leaps through the window and into the night. The Young Girl awakes and rises. She picks up the rose she dropped and kisses it. The curtain falls.|$|E

25|$|The first type is mold erosion, {{which is}} the wearing away of the mold as the liquid metal fills the mold. This type of defect usually only occurs in sand {{castings}} because most other casting processes have more robust molds. The castings produced have rough spots and excess material. The molding sand becomes incorporated into the casting metal and decreases the ductility, fatigue strength, and fracture toughness of the casting. This {{can be caused by}} a sand with too little strength or a pouring velocity that is too fast. The pouring velocity can be reduced by redesigning the gating system to use larger runners or multiple gates. A related source of defects are drops, in which part of the molding sand from the cope <b>drops</b> <b>into</b> the casting while it is still a liquid. This also occurs when the mold is not properly rammed.|$|E
25|$|Having enlisted voluntarily in 1939, he {{was made}} {{prisoner}} on 23 June 1940. While in prison he re-arranged the hyphen in his name. He escaped, joined the internal Resistance in Dordogne and helped arrange (along with his wife Gaby Pierre-Bloch (d. 1996)) {{some of the first}} parachute <b>drops</b> <b>into</b> France of agents, arms and equipment sent by de Gaulle's headquarters in London. Again arrested with his wife (in Marseille) and imprisoned in October 1941 on treason charges, he escaped in July 1942 courtesy of saws, keys and money his wife (released after three months) had hidded in parcels she sent him. He then joined General de Gaulle in London, heading the civilian section of the central bureau of intelligence and action (BCRA or secret services of Free France) from 1942 to 1943. In this capacity he saw the names of all resistants. He was thus a key witness at Maurice Papon's trial, at which he participated at the age of 93.|$|E
25|$|The updated {{alignment}} {{from the}} 2007 West LRT Report includes the line running on an elevated guideway beginning {{west of the}} Downtown West â€“ Kerby Station, running along the CPR right of way to Bow Trail SW, and then to 24th Street SW.

The line then follows {{the north side of}} 17th Avenue SW past 37th Street SW below grade to 45 Street Station. Past 45th Street the line runs at grade, and approaching Sarcee Trail SW moves onto an elevated guideway that passes over the freeway. The line then runs at grade to Sirocco Station, then proceeds to drop below grade and pass under eastbound 17th Avenue SW at 69th Street SW and return to grade {{on the south side of}} the avenue.

500|$|Batman: The Ride {{begins with}} the track floor descending. The train moves {{out of the station}} and up a chain lift hill. At {{the top of the hill}} the train dips down through a Bolliger & Mabillard pre-drop, coasts down a 190-degree swoop to the left, and <b>drops</b> <b>into</b> the first {{360-degree}} vertical loop. It then flips through a Heartline Spin [...] (zero-G roll), followed by another vertical loop. The train then travels upward around a tight spiral to the left, then through a wider turn to the right, drops slightly, and quickly turns through the first corkscrew (referred to as a [...] "flatspin" [...] by the manufacturer). Following this is a tight right turn and another flatspin, then a tight left turnaround before the train enters the final brake run.|$|E

[...] Edginer agreed, commenting that despite the small size of the novel compared to other popular books, When You Reach Me is a [...] "taut novel, every word, every sentence, has meaning and substance." [...] Publishers Weekly added that even the smallest of detailsâ€”Miranda's name, her strange habits and why she carries A Wrinkle in Time with herâ€”have a reason for their inclusion {{by the end of the}} novel.|$|E
