5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I {{made up my}} mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E
