40|$|The {{utilization}} of scrap rubber from tyre-retreading industry for <b>footstep</b> compound have been investigated. Pretreatment of rubber scrap with minarex B was done {{before it was}} compounded. The <b>footstep</b> compound was designed with various ratio of RSS/pretreated rubber scrap: 100 / 0; 75 / 25; 50 / 50, and 25 / 75 respectively. The compounds were prepared on a two-rolls mill machine. The compounds were tested for its physical properties such as tensile strength, elongation at break, abrassion resistance, hardness, density, permanent set, and aging, respectively. Test result was compared with physical properties of current commercial <b>footstep.</b> The physical properties of invented <b>footstep</b> compounds were better than current commercial <b>footstep.</b> The <b>footstep</b> compound made by using the RSS and pretreated rubber scrap in ratio of 75 / 25 performed the best physical properties with 146, 48 kg/cm 3 tensile strength; 253, 36 % elongation at break; 58, 33 Shore A hardness, 2, 91 mm 3 /kgm abrasion resistance, 1, 23 g/cm 3 density, 4, 69 % permanent set, and the change of physical properties after aging at temperature 70 oC for 3 x 24 hours were 1, 90 % tensile strength, 5, 02 % elongation at break, and 4, 04 % hardness, respectively.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel {{formulation of the}} <b>footstep</b> planning problem as a mixed-integer convex optimization. The <b>footstep</b> planning problem involves choosing a set of <b>footstep</b> locations which a walking robot can follow to safely reach a goal through an environment with obstacles. Rather than attempting to avoid the obstacles, which would require nonconvex constraints, we use integer variables to assign each <b>footstep</b> to a convex region of obstacle-free terrain, while simultaneously optimizing its pose within that safe region. Since existing methods for generating convex obstacle-free regions were ill-suited to this task, we also present IRIS (Iterative Regional In Inflation by Semidefinite programming), a new method to generate such regions {{through a series of}} convex optimizations. Combining IRIS with the mixed-integer optimization gives a complete <b>footstep</b> planning architecture, which can produce complex <b>footstep</b> plans on height map data constructed from onboard sensors. We demonstrate the <b>footstep</b> planner in simulated environments and with real data sensed by the Atlas humanoid, and we discuss future applications to running robots, aerial vehicles, and robots with more than two legs. by Robin L.

30|$|The <b>footstep</b> length {{may also}} be {{estimated}} from the IMU data. If the sensor is mounted on the foot, {{it is possible to}} detect when the foot is motionless and then integrate the <b>footstep</b> length from the IMU data [5]. If the IMU is handheld, this method cannot be used, but the <b>footstep</b> length can be inferred from the IMU data also by other methods, see for example [6, 7]. A PDR system can greatly improve the positioning locally as the position estimate may be updated at every <b>footstep,</b> but because the errors accumulate over time, PDR is often combined with other sensors that can, at least occasionally, provide absolute position information.|$|R

40|$|The brain organizes sound into {{coherent}} sequences, termed audi-tory streams.

Occasional deviations in the <b>footstep</b> sequences elicited the mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential.

40|$|Abstract — Despite {{the stable}} walking {{capabilities}} of modern biped humanoid robots, {{their ability to}} autonomously and safely navigate obstacle-filled, unpredictable environments {{has so far been}} limited. We present an approach to autonomous humanoid walking that combines vision-based sensing with a <b>footstep</b> planner, allowing the robot to navigate toward a desired goal position while avoiding obstacles. An environment map including the robot, goal, and obstacle locations is built in real-time from vision. The <b>footstep</b> planner then computes an optimal sequence of <b>footstep</b> locations within a time-limited planning horizon. <b>Footstep</b> plans are reused and only partially recomputed as the environment changes during the walking sequence. In our experiments, combining real-time vision with plan reuse has allowed a Honda ASIMO humanoid robot to autonomously traverse dynamic environments containing unpredictably moving obstacles...|$|R
