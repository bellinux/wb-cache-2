Mayor Marion Barry, {{attempting}} {{to alleviate the}} economic distress caused by the early 1980s recession, announced in early 1984 that he had targeted Ivy City for a major revitalization effort. The neighborhood was still overwhelmingly industrial, with the city having located its animal shelter and a vehicle <b>inspection</b> <b>lot</b> in the area. The area skyline was dominated by the chimney of the now-dormant trash incinerator. There was an extensive amount of abandoned property, and what housing remained was often overcrowded and in extreme disrepair. At 12 percent, the home ownership rate in Ivy City was the worst of any neighborhood in the District (where the rate of home ownership was about 33 percent). The Ivy City population was highly transient, {{and the rate of}} drug and alcohol addiction was high. Fifty percent of all households in Ivy City were led by a single mother, {{a large percentage of the}} Ivy City population were high school dropouts, and unemployment was extremely high. About 20 percent of Ivy City residents received public assistance, and infant mortality was 38.3 per thousand, double that of the rest of the District of Columbia. Ivy City was also a food desert, with the nearest supermarket more than [...] away (an hour's bus ride) and only a single convenience store. Ivy City also became notorious for its open air drug markets. The District of Columbia National Guard even used arc lamps to illuminate streets and alleys in Ivy City at night in order to discourage drug dealers.|$|E
40|$|Models {{in which}} process quality and lot sizing {{interact}} {{have recently been}} developed. Lot sizes should be reduced to compensate for poor quality if no effective inspection is possible. This note introduces an inspection delay time, measured in units produced after an inspection is made until results are known. If the inspection delay is negligible, then the problem reduces essentially to two separate lot sizing problems: the classical EOQ lot sizing problem and an <b>inspection</b> <b>lot</b> sizing problem. If the delay is great, then only one inspection should be made and the lot size is as given by Porteus, and Rosenblatt and Lee. This note seeks the optimal production and <b>inspection</b> <b>lot</b> sizes for {{the full spectrum of}} inspection delays. The impact of the results is illustrated numerically. The value of automated defect control (with 100 % inspection and immediate production stoppage upon detection of a defect) is discussed. inventory/production, quality control, lot sizing, inspection delay...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for a}} decision criterion for disposing an <b>inspection</b> <b>lot</b> is developed. An expression of the posterior cost is formulated {{in terms of the}} quality characteristics $X$ of the items manufactured, the sample size $n$, the lot size $N$, the upper and lower limits of $X$ ($U$, $L$) of the individual items, the sample mean $overline{x}$, the mean $mu$ and variance $sigma^ 2 $ of $X$, also in terms of the economical cost parameters, Optimizing the posterior cost equation leads to the estimation of the decision points. A procedure to accept, reject, screen or scrap the entire lot based on the values of the decision points is developed. Mathematical expressions are derived for the expected cost of lot acceptance, screening and scrapping. In developing the model, the distribution of $X$ and $mu$ are normal. The tested items can be used for their intended purposes after testing. The defective items can be repaired or reworked. Rejected lots are either screened or scrapped. The decision to accept or reject a lot depends on the upper and lower limits of the sample mean, which constitutes the decision points...|$|E

The design parameters of the proposed sampling system are determined by the two-point approach considering the producer’s risks and the consumer’s at the specified acceptable reliability level and the lot tolerance reliability level, respectively.

A lot of the product is accepted {{if the number of}} failures is smaller than the specified number of failures [...] c, otherwise, the lot of the product is rejected. In real industry, there some situations when the experimenter is uncertain either the product should be labeled as defective or good.

The single {{sampling plans}} for the inspection by variables and for the inspection by variables and attributes (all items from the sample are inspected by variables, remainder of rejected lots is inspected by attributes) were then proposed. Under the same protection of consumer the LTPD plans for inspection by variables are in many situations more economical than the corresponding sampling plans for inspection by attributes. Comparative efficiency of sampling plan for inspection by variables and attributes can be assessed using a measure which has been proposed for this purpose...|$|R
30|$|A new neutrosophic fuzzy {{sampling}} plan using the neutrosophic statistics {{is presented in}} this paper. The proposed plan is more flexible than the {{sampling plan}}s using classical statistics. The lot acceptance probability for various acceptance numbers and sample sizes are presented. The rules to find the probability of determinate, indeterminate and acceptance {{of a lot of}} the product given and some tables are given for the practical use. The existing sampling plan under the classical statistics has only the determined probability value and becomes the special case of the proposed plan when no certainty in the sample or in the population. The comparative study shows that the proposed plan is more effective and adequate than the sampling plan using classical statistics under the uncertainty environment. The proposed sampling plan can only be used when data are discrete. It is recommended that the proposed plan should apply for the <b>inspection</b> of <b>lot</b> of products under the uncertainty environment. The proposed sampling plan using the cost model can be considered as future research. The proposed plan under the time truncated life test can be considered as future research.|$|R
30|$|To {{achieve the}} high quality of the product, an {{inspection}} of the product from raw material to the final product {{is an essential part}} of the manufacturing process. The <b>inspection</b> of a <b>lot</b> of the product through the sampling plan ensures not accepting the bad lot or rejecting a good lot of the product. For the final submitted lot of the product, the supplier is often interested to know the lot acceptance probability. In the traditional acceptance sampling plan, a random sample from a lot of the product is selected and inspected for the purpose of the lot sentencing. A lot of the product is either rejected or accepted on the basis of sample information. The decision of acceptance or rejection is made under the assumption that there is no indeterminate in the data. More details about the attribute sampling plan using the traditional/classical statistics can be seen in [1].|$|R

The production process is imperfect and produces {{a certain number of}} defective items with a known probability density function. The vendor delivers the items to the buyer in small lots of equally sized shipments. Upon receipt of the items, the buyer will conduct a 100 % <b>inspection.</b> Since each <b>lot</b> contains a variable number of defective items, shortages may occur at the buyer. We assume that shortages are permitted and are completely backordered. The objective is to minimize the total joint annual costs incurred by the vendor and the buyer.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author proposes to {{determine}} some general relationships linking the functions that express {{the effectiveness of}} a sampling plan in lot acceptance sampling. The result is obtained through the introduction of a function which provides the expected number of units, to be drawn from a lot of given quality, with reference to accepted lots only. This function, together with the OC function, appears in the expression of the ASN, ATI and AOQ functions, which provide the economic design of a sampling plan. In addition, the author defines two functions by introducing some costs per unit of the inspection, substitution and utilization of defective items. The first one expresses the producer's expected gain from the application of a sampling plan to replace one hundred per cent <b>inspection</b> of <b>lots,</b> the second one expresses the consumer's expected gain from the application of a sampling plan to replace the acceptance of <b>lots</b> without <b>inspection.</b> For whichever type of sampling plan, single, double, multiple or sequential, it is sufficient to determine the form of the first function mentioned in the opening paragraph and the OC function, to express the remaining functions. Some examples are provided to clarify the proposed procedure. Of particular importance is the application in the case of sequential sampling plans where, through the use of some results related to random walks with two absorbing barriers, it is possible to obtain approximate expressions of all the above functions...|$|R
30|$|From Table  3, it can {{be noted}} that the {{existing}} sampling plan under the classical statistics method provides the determined values at all specified parameters. On the other hand, the proposed plan under the neutrosophic interval method provides the probabilities in the interval. For an example, when n[*]=[*] 5, the lot acceptance probability is 0.1632, the probability of indeterminacy (i.e., neither an acceptance not a reject) is 0.6333. It means, that when a <b>lot</b> of <b>inspection</b> with n[*]=[*] 5 and c[*]=[*] 0 is applied for the <b>inspection</b> of the <b>lot,</b> there is 63 % chance that an experimenter is undecided about the lot sentencing. By comparing both sampling plans, we note that the plan under the classical statistics only has the decision of acceptance or rejection of the lot. The existing plan does not provide any information about the indeterminacy. So, the proposed sampling under the neutrosophic statistics is more effective and adequate under the uncertainty environment and this conclusion coincides with [21].|$|R

First, we obtain the optimal product inspection policies for different PSPL for a given lot in the in-control or out-of-control state. Properties for the inspection policy are explored. Then, the expected total cost function, which includes setup cost, process maintenance cost and quality-related control cost, is obtained. The optimal production lot size that minimizes the expected total cost per item is determined. Our proposed inspection policy is compared with the three policies of no inspection, full inspection, and disregarding the first s items policy, in which only items from s+ 1 until the end of the production lot are inspected. Differences in the minimum expected total cost per item between our proposed inspection policy and the other three policies are investigated with a numerical example...|$|R

To demonstrate readiness for transition into Full Rate Production by the Armament Munitions & Chemical Command (AMCCOM), ARDEC/HDL managed the first production for war reserves as well as the construction of automated Initial Production Facilities (IPF) for mobilization readiness. HDL awarded three competitive contracts in 1978/79: Eastman Kodak (Rochester, NY) for the Fuze Assembly and IPF, Motorola (Scottsdale, AZ) for the Amplifier Assembly and IPF, and Alinabal (Milford, CT.) for the Alternator Assembly and IPF. After successful First Article <b>Inspection</b> and production <b>Lot</b> Acceptance tests, transition was completed in March 1983. AMCCOM performed all procurements for stockpile with technical support by ARDEC. The Army Mortar Plan issued in 1985 expanded use of the M734 fuze to 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm mortars (Figures 8,9).

40|$|Uranium cores have a {{grain size}} {{specification}} of A 8 to A 3. Large grain size is denoted {{by a small}} ``A`` number and small grain by larger ``A`` numbers. Grain sizes smaller than A 9 denote an untransformed core which presumably has a high rupture potential. Grain sizes larger than A 3 cause swelling, or bumping, of the fuel thus increasing the probability of rupture failure. Presently, tests are made on all cores received to determine compliance to the above specifications. As {{a result of a}} recent study and analysis of all pertinent factors applicable to this situation, it is concluded that 100 % <b>inspection</b> of all <b>lots</b> received at HAPO for compliance to grain size specifications is neither warranted nor economically justifiable. In lieu of the present screening, a system is proposed to insure that screening is effected only when there is an economic incentive. Such a system requires that the Feedsite (NLO) maintain its present process control sampling plan of 5 cores per ingot. A sampling receiving inspection at HAPO will be used to detect major shifts in the quality of cores to insure that screening is used only when there is an economic incentive. This sampling inspection, in place of the present 100 % screening, will result in an estimated annual savings, to IPD, of $ 52, 500, based on the 0. 0057 % defective rate currently observed in the incoming material received at HAPO...|$|R
40|$|Inspection is {{the formal}} {{examination}} {{of a product}} manufactured by any manufacturing process. Inspection process is critical to all the industries as it ensures that a good quality product reach at the end customers. In order to ensure minimum variation {{in the quality of}} inspection of a product, industries rely on advanced equipment or gauge to measure the quality parameters of the product. The accuracy of <b>inspection</b> depends a <b>lot</b> on the method and equipments used to inspect a product. However, at AvCarb material solutions, a product called pyrolytic graphite sheet (PGS) is manufactured and at present the types of defects that occur during their manufacturing process can only be identified visually. The problem with using human senses as a tool to perform an inspection is that the accuracy and speed of the inspection vary from person to person based on their experience, their state of mind and other human factors. Automating a visual inspection system ensures minimum variation in the accuracy and speed of an inspection process. This thesis proposes the use of the automatic vision system to perform visual inspection of PGS. The document presents how some software tools can be used to identify and quantify the defects generated on PGS and gives a comparison of the accuracy of identifying a defect through the automatic vision system and accuracy achieved through human inspection. by Yugank Chawla.

40|$|Phytosanitary import {{inspections}} {{are important}} to avoid entry of harmful pests on live plants. In the European Union (EU), all consignments of live plants must be inspected at the first point of entry, and plants allowed entry can be moved without further inspection among the 28 Member States and Switzerland. It is important that inspections in EU countries adhere to the same standard to avoid {{introduction of harmful organisms}} through countries with weaker methods. We tested whether sampling intensity and confidence in the inspection results were the same across these countries. Questionnaires were sent to inspectors in all countries, asking about inspections of individual consignments of woody plants for planting. Data about 102 lots, inspected at 13 points of entry in six countries, were analyzed. We used hypergeometric and binomial statistics for small and large consignments, respectively, to calculate the probability that < 1 % of the plants were infested. The duration of the <b>inspection</b> increased with <b>lot</b> size, but the probability that the infestation level was below 1 % of the plants was lower for small than for large lots. Moreover, large international differences in inspection intensity and the probability that the inspections could detect a level of infestation below 1 % were found: the probability was consistently above 0. 95 in one country, while the average probability was below 0. 6 in the other countries. We suggest that the EU Member States adopt common maximum acceptable infestation levels and harmonized, statistics-based sampling protocols for plants for planting.

40|$|This report {{describes}} a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) investigation assessing {{the prevalence of}} a lack of sufficient start-up oxygen in CSE SR- 100 self-contained self-rescuer (SCSR) devices. The availability of sufficient start-up oxygen is critical to the performance of the SR- 100. As part of a routine field testing program of SCSRs used in coal mines, NIOSH and MSHA detected two SR- 100 s that lacked sufficient start-up oxygen. CSE Corporation subsequently discovered one SCSR that lacked sufficient start-up oxygen in that company's internal quality control program and voluntarily stopped further production and sales of SR- 100 s. NIOSH developed a protocol to test for the presence of start-up oxygen in field-deployed SR 100 s. The purpose of the test was to determine if the failure rate of the start-up oxygen in the population of 70, 000 field-deployed units exceeded 1 %. NIOSH and MSHA used American Society for Quality (ASQ), Sampling Procedures and Tables for <b>Inspection</b> of Isolated <b>Lots</b> by Attributes (ASQC Q 3 - 1988). In assessing the SR- 100 s, if no more than 3 failures of start-up oxygen occurred in the 500 -unit random sample, the SR- 100 could be accepted as meeting the Limiting Quality (LQ) rate of 1. 25 % for start-up oxygen performance. NIOSH tested five hundred field-deployed devices collected from coal mines throughout the United States. NIOSH observed 5 start-up oxygen failures in the 500 units it tested. The maximum number of failures allowed under the LQ rate of 1. 25 % was exceeded; therefore, the 1 % maximum allowable failure rate under the protocol was not met.
