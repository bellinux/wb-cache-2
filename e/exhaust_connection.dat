5000|$|ATAC System: The Honda Automatic Torque Amplification Chamber {{system works}} by {{effectively}} increasing or decreasing {{the volume of}} the exhaust system with a small butterfly valve located just before the <b>exhaust</b> <b>connection.</b> At low RPM a centrifugal crankshaft driven gear opens the valve into a small chamber and increases {{the volume of the}} exhaust by allowing the exhaust gases to flow through the chamber. At high RPM the ATAC valve is closed and the exhaust simply exits into the expansion chamber. A larger expansion chamber allows for more power at lower RPMs because of the extra time needed for the impulse to [...] "bounce" [...] back for the supercharger effect. It was used on their CR motocrossers, GP bikes and MTX, MVX, NS and NSR road bikes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA DoS attack can be {{regarded}} as an attempt of attackers to prevent legal users from gaining a normal network service. The TCP connection management protocol sets a position for a classic DoS attack, namely, the SYN flood attack. In this attack some sources send a large number of TCP SYN segments, without completing the third handshake step to quickly <b>exhaust</b> <b>connection</b> resources of the under attack system. This paper models the under attack server by using the queuing theory in which attack requests are recognized based on their long service time. Then it proposes a framework in which the defense issue is formulated as an optimization problem and employs the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimally solve this problem. PSO tries to direct the server to an optimum defense point by dynamically setting two TCP parameters, namely, maximum number of connections and maximum duration of a half-open connection. The simulation results show that the proposed defense strategy improves the performance of the under attack system in terms of rejection probability of connection requests and efficient consumption of buffer space...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergency}} {{diesel engine}} combustion air {{intake and exhaust}} system (EDECAIES) supplies combustion air of reliable quality to the diesel engines*, and exhausts the products of combustion from the diesel engines to the atmosphere. The PSB reviews the system from the outside air intake to the combustion air supply lines connected to the diesel engine interface, and from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>connections</b> at the diesel engine interface to the discharge point outside the building to assure conformance with General Design Criteria 2, 4, 5, and 17. 1. The PSB reviews the EDECAIES to verify that: a.

40|$|Let F be a {{probability}} distribution with {{support on the}} non-negative integers. Two algorithms are described for generating a stationary random graph, with vertex set Z, so that the degrees of the vertices are i. i. d. random variables with distribution F. Focus is on an algorithm where, initially, a random number of "stubs" with distribution F is attached to each vertex. Each stub is then randomly assigned a direction, left or right, and the edge configuration is obtained by pairing stubs pointing to each other, first <b>exhausting</b> all possible <b>connections</b> between nearest neighbors, then linking second nearest neighbors, and so on. Under the assumption that F has finite mean, it is shown that this algorithm leads to a well-defined configuration, but that the expected length of the shortest edge of a vertex is infinite. It is also shown that any stationary algorithm for pairing stubs with random, independent directions gives infinite mean for the total length of the edges of a given vertex. Connections {{to the problem of}} constructing finitary isomorphisms between Bernoulli shifts are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—BitTorrent is {{a popular}} {{peer-to-peer}} file-sharing protocol that utilizes a central server, known as a “tracker”, to coordinate connections between peers in a “swarm”, a term used to describe a BitTorrent ad-hoc file sharing network. The tracker of a swarm is specified by the original file distributor and trusted unconditionally by peers in the swarm. This central point of control {{provides an opportunity for}} a file distributor to deploy a modified tracker to provide peers in a swarm with malicious coordination data, directing peer connection traffic toward an arbitrary target machine on an arbitrary service port. Although such an attack does not generate huge amount of attack traffic, it would set up many connections with the victim server successfully and hold these connections until time out, which could cause serious denial-of-service by <b>exhausting</b> a server’s <b>connection</b> resource. In this paper, we present such an attack that is entirely tracker-based, requiring no modifications to BitTorrent client software and could be deployed by an attacker right now. The results from both simulation and real-world experiments show the applicability of this attack. Due to the skyrocketing popularity of BitTorrent and numerous large-scale swarms existed in the Internet, BitTorrent swarms provide an intriguing platform for launching distributed denial-of-service attacks based on connection exhaustion.

40|$|While the {{gas turbine}} by {{itself has been}} applied in {{particular}} cases for power generation and {{is in a state}} of promising development in this field, it has already met with considerable success in two cases when used as an <b>exhaust</b> turbine in <b>connection</b> with a centrifugal compressor, namely, in the supercharging of combustion engines and in the Velox process, which is of particular application for furnaces. In the present paper the most important possibilities of combining a combustion engine with a gas turbine are considered. These "combination engines " are compared with the simple gas turbine on whose state of development a brief review will first be given. The critical evaluation of the possibilities of development and fields of application of the various combustion engine systems, wherever it is not clearly expressed in the publications referred to, represents the opinion of the author. The state of development of the internal-combustion engine is in its main features generally known. It is used predominantly at the present time for the propulsion of aircraft and road vehicles and, except for certain restrictions due to war conditions, has been used to an increasing extent in ships and rail cars and in some fields applied as stationary power generators. In the Diesel engine a most economical heat engine with a useful efficiency of about 40 percent exists and in the Otto aircraft engine a heat engine of greatest power per unit weight of about 0. 5 kilogram per horsepower...|$|R
40|$|Bac k g r o u n d: Biomass {{smoke is}} an {{important}} source of particulate matter (PM), and much remains to be discovered with respect to the human health effects associated with this specific PM source. Exposure to biomass smoke can occur in one of two main categories: short-term exposures consist of periodic, seasonal exposures typified by communities near forest fires or intentional agricultural burning, and long-term exposures are chronic and typified by the use of biomass materials for cooking or heating. Levoglucosan (LG), a sugar anhydride released by combustion of cellulosecontaining materials, is an attractive candidate as a biomarker of wood smoke exposure. Objectives: In the present study, Balb/c mice and children were assessed for LG in urine to determine its feasibility as a biomarker. Me t h o d s: We performed urinary detection of LG by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry after intranasal instillations of LG or concentrated PM (mice) or biomass exposure (mice or humans). Re s u l t s: After instillation, we recovered most of the LG within the first 4 hr. Experiments using glucose instillation proved the specificity of our system, and instillation of concentrated PM from wood smoke, ambient air, and diesel <b>exhaust</b> supported a <b>connection</b> between wood smoke and LG. In addition, LG was detected in the urine of mice exposed to wood smoke. Finally, a pilot human study proved our ability to detect LG in urine of children. Con c l u s i o n s: These results demonstrate that LG in the lungs is detectable in the urine of both mice and humans and that it is a good candidate as a biomarker of exposure to biomass smoke...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenging}} {{number is}} used for the detection of Spoofing attack. The IP Spoofing is considered {{to be one of the}} potentially brutal attack which acts as a tool for the DDoS attack which is considered to be a major threat among security problems in today's internet. These kinds of attack are extremely severe. They bring down business of company drastically. DDoS attack can easily exhaust the computing and communication resources of its victim within a short period of time. There are attacks exploiting some vulnerability or implementation bug in the software implementation of a service to bring that down and some attacks will use all the available resources at the target machine. This deals on attacks that consume all the bandwidth available to the victim machine. While concentrating on the bandwidth attack the TCP SYN flood is the more prominent attack. TCP/IP protocol suite is the most widely used protocol suite for data communication. The TCP SYN flood works by <b>exhausting</b> the TCP <b>connection</b> queue of the host and thus denying legitimate connection request. There are various methods used to detect and prevent this attack, one of which is to block the packet based on SYN flag count from the same IP address. This kind of prevention methods becomes unsuitable when the attackers use the Spoofed IP address. The SYN spoofing becomes a major tool the TCP SYN flooding. For the prevention of this kind of attacks, the TCP specific probing is used in the proposed scheme where the client is requested challenging number while sending the ACK in the three way hand shake. This is very useful to find the Spoofed IP Packets/TCP SYN flood and preventing them...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{research}} and development are forced to utilize the limited fossil energy sources in an economical manner {{in order to obtain}} higher efficiency rates by energy conversion. To this end, procedures must also be taken into account which, up to now, have beenregarded as uneconomic in view of the low prices of primary energy. While the possibilities of a better energy utilization are largely <b>exhausted</b> in <b>connection</b> with conventional thermal power stations, newly designed technological processes promise to yield further increases in the efficiency rate. This conclusion was reached by more than 220 specialists during a conference at the KFA Jülich on February 4 - 5, 1976. "Technologies for improved energy utilization in power plants" was therefore the subject of a symposium, to which KFA Jülich, being in charge of the project management for energy research, had invited specialists in the fields of {{research and}} industry. It was the purpose of this conference to point out: — the status of power plant engineering and possible development approaches,- today's industrial research activities in the field of power plant engineering, - limits to improved energy utilization from a technical, industrial, and economic point of view, — research objectives aiming at improved utilization of fossil energy sources. This is to summarize some of the important results obtained {{in the course of this}} conference. There still exist at present quite a number of unused possibilities to better utilize the energy in thermal power plants and there is also by no means a lack of technologies: the realization of systems of higher conversion efficiency is rather impeded, even today, by the enormous financial expenditure involved. The aim of new developments in the field of electricity generation from coal is not only an improvement in the efficiency rate, but also an improvement in environmental protection. In presentday power plant engineering, the efficiency rate is governed by the steam process. When adhering to current process techniques, a further improvement in the efficiency rate is only feasible by increasing the temperature of steam conditions. This will, however, only lead to an improvement in the efficiency rate by 1 %, since it implies the use of expensive austenitic material. Improvements in the efficiency rate for electricity generation can therefore only be achieved economically when applying novel process techniques. In this connection, the following methods are being discussed: — direct conversion of chemical energy into electricity using fuel cells, - increase of process temperature by using gas turbines and combined gas/steam turbine processes, - application of conversion processes producing not only electricity, but also other kinds of energy in a third stage, e. g. steam, — processes using nuclear energy in addition to coal and producing electricity as well energy in a third stage. All these processes require the availability of gaseous energy from coal, either as chemical energy or in the form of heat. The status and the problems involved in the development of these techniques are discussed in detail, and two separate contributions deal withpotential improvements in the efficiency rate of steam and gas turbines and with the use of gas/steam turbine blocks. The possibilities of improving the efficiency rate of the combustion process in conventional power plants have been largely exhausted, a fact which is also true for possible improvements in the energy yield of fossil energy sources. Development work is still being carried out in connection with the optimization of individual power plants, which is influenced by boundary conditions such as mode of application and situation on the fuel market, and for the technical improvement of individual components.

40|$|The MIT Microengine Project is an {{on-going}} {{effort to}} build a MEMS based gas turbine engine and turbo generator. This thesis covers the development and testing of the packaging needed for the microengine and related devices. The packaging of the microengine includes the fluidic, electrical, and sensor connections that interface the engine with the supplies and instruments necessary for operation. Making connections to the device is difficult because each connection must be gastight, able to bond to a device made entirely of silicon, and capable of withstanding temperatures from 25 °C to 900 °C. The method chosen for connection was glass sealing, which has been used extensively for metal-to-glass seals in electronics packaging but is a novel approach for making metal-to-silicon connections. The three strength-limiting factors found in metal-to-glass-to-silicon seals were the existence of voids in the glass, the lack of wetting of the glass on the silicon, and the residual stress in the silicon due to thermal expansion mismatch with the glass. Sessile drop tests were conducted to determine which process parameters affect these strength-limiting factors. Voids were found {{to depend on the}} type of glass used, specifically the manufacturing process of the preforms, and wetting was found to depend on both the atmosphere used in the furnace while making the bond and the type of glass being used. Test samples were made using both the baseline process and the improved process recommended by the results of the sessile drop tests. Mechanical testing of the samples confirmed that using the improved process increased the strength and reliability of the joints. Macro connections are the interface between the micro tubes and wires exiting a device and the macro supplies and instruments in the lab. Several different options were explored for making these connections, three of which were tried on different devices. A fixed plate method is recommended for making macro connections due to its support of the tubes, protection of the device, and ease of assembly. Inlet, <b>exhaust,</b> and electrical <b>connections</b> were also considered and several different options for each are presented. The results of this thesis are an improved process for making metal-to-glass-to-silicon seals, a roadmap for packaging future devices, and recommendations for interfacing the microengine with the micro aerial vehicle. Future work in packaging should include a more detailed study of wetting, the manufacturing process of preforms, and the possibility of wafer level packaging. by Todd S. Harrison. Thesis (S. M.)
