40|$|The {{training}} ship of the Nagasaki University Faculty of Fisheries, the "Nagasaki-maru" on her training voyage, {{happened to be}} overtaken by Typhoon No. 17 (Rubby), at Hongkong on September 5, 1964, and, being under the gusts of the maximum momentary velocity of 40 m/s for about 2 hours, recorded the maximum momentary wind velocity 54 m/s and the minimum atmospheric pressure 966 mb. Among the vessels at anchor there, 3 ships sank after grounding, 14 ships grounded and 120 junks sank. Owing to the operation by the angle regulation of the variable pitch propeller and the remote control of the main engine revolution, " the Nagasaki-maru" succeeded in keeping anchoring through the storm for about 8 hours without dragging the anchor. From these experiences and records, some studies were made on the anchoring in strong wind at a single ancdor of the variable propeller ship, {{and the results are}} reported here. (1) During the anchoring of 7 hours and 41 minutes, the regulations of the propeller pitch angle and the engine revolution were performed 726 times, that is, 1. 6 times per minute; and in every five minutes, 14 times were maximum and 2 times were minimum. (2) During the time, the anchoring was kept with the ship speed at 4 to 6 knots under the wind blowing at the maximum momentary velocity of 30 to 40 m/s and at 6 to 8 knots under the wind at the maximum momentary velocity of 40 to 50 m/s. However, the ship speed must be regulated properly according to the gustiness. When the gust changed its direction suddenly at the velocity of about 50 m/s, the helm was changed to head against the wind with the ship speed of about 11 knots. (3) The chief officer must be posted at the forecastle to report about the direction and the tension of the anchor chain. This is very important when the engine is operated in anchoring. And the ship is necessary to have an equipment furnished to connect the bridge with the forecastle. (4) The anchorage must be set up at a broad area of the sea without obstacles because the ship moves in a large scope using th﻿ engine, But it must not be positioned facing an open sea. It is needless to say that the type of the bottom is desirable to be good for holding the anchor. (5) The anchor chain should be slackened as long as possible. This serves not only to increase the holding power of the anchor but also to enlarge the action radius of the ship. (6) It is necessary to keep anchoring, knowing the position of the anchor by a buoy or a light buoy on the anchor. (7) When the variable pitch propeller ship tries to anchor using the engine, the engine can, of course. used easily. But it is left to a future study which is the more suitable, anchoring at a single anchor under the operation of the engine; or anchoring using another anchor as a preventive of yaw under the operation of the engine, for example, as the <b>hammer</b> <b>lock</b> moor, without letting the ship move so much﻿ 1) 7 時間 41 分の守錨の間に, 726 回のプロペラピッチ角度及び機関回転数の調整を行なった. 即ち平均 1 分間 1. 6 回の操作であり, 5 分間別に見ると 14 回が最多使用回数であり, 2 回が最少使用回数である. 2) 守錨時の船速は,最大瞬間風速 30 m/sから 40 m/sまでは, 4 ノットより 6 ノットの船速で,又 40 m/sから 50 m/sまでは, 6 ノットより 8 ノットの船速で守錨した. 然﻿し風の息を見ながら適宜調整しなければならない. 風向が,急変した 50 m/s前後の突風の場合は, 11 ノット前後の船速で転舵し,錨及び錨鎖の把駐力を利用し容易に風に立て得た. 3) 一等航海士を船首楼に配置し常に,錨鎖の方向,張力を報告させなければならない. これは守錨上の機関使用に非常に重大な事である. 又船橋と船首楼の間の連絡が,直ちにとれる装置が必要である. 4) 錨地は機関を使用し,広範囲の運動をする関係上邪魔物のない海面を選定しなければならない. 然し,外海に面して居ってはいけない. 錨かきの良好な底質である事は勿論である. 5) 錨鎖は許容限度まで伸ばす. これは錨及び錨鎖の把駐力を増す目的ばかりでなく,船の行動半径を広くするためでもある. 6) 錨に浮標又は燈浮標(漁業用) をつけ,錨の位置を知って守錨する事が必要である. 7) 可変ピッチプロペラ船の守錨の場合,容易に機関使用出来得るので,単錨泊にて機関使用し広い行動半径での守錨が,最適か,他の一錨を振れ止めに使用し,例えば,Hammer Lock Moorで余り船を行動させず機関使用して守錨するか,何れが最適であるかは,今後の問題である...|$|E

50|$|For {{practicing}} quick-draw extensively, {{the very}} best bet is a Jordan holster sewn to a wide stout belt, with tie-down straps to secure {{the bottom of the}} holster firmly to your leg. It is best to prep a new quick-draw holster by putting the gun inside of six or seven gallon-size Ziploc bags and sealing each one, then wetting the holster thoroughly in a bucket of warm water with a little soap in it and jamming the gun into the holster to shape it, then letting the holster dry completely. Without the bags, the gun will be a loose fit in the holster. For uniformed police-officers, it does them good to learn how to unsnap the safety strap, which is snapped across the <b>hammer</b> to <b>lock</b> the gun into the holster, {{as an integral part of}} the quick-draw, without slowing or stopping the hand in that process. (Do not use a thumb-break safety strap for quick-draw.) A shoe-repair shop can sew a small bent-up piece of sheet metal to the bottom of the tag-end of the safety strap to hold it away from the holster and enable the extended fingers sweeping up the side of the holster to pop the snap on the safety strap so that it will fly up out of the way as the hand draws the gun.|$|R

50|$|In the {{preparation}} phase, the plunger, guide bar and guide disk are pushed {{forward by the}} compression spring. At {{the end of the}} movement the hammer mass is hooked by the pawl. During the loading phase the hammer is pushed towards the surface in a controlled movement. The <b>hammer</b> mass remains <b>locked</b> in place by the pawl. This has the effect of stretching the impact spring to put it under tension. Impact Rebound: At {{the very end of the}} movement, the pawl spring releases the hammer mass. The impact spring contracts causing the hammer mass to strike against the plunger. This is the impact. The hammer mass then rebounds back to the body of the hammer and distance travelled is recorded on the scale. The rebound distance depends directly on the hardness of the roll under test: A softer roll will absorb more of the impact energy and the rebound distance will be less.A harder roll will reflect more of the impact energy and the rebound distance will increase.|$|R

5000|$|Edwards is {{best known}} for his [...] "Lynch Fragments". Inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, these {{small-scale}} welded metal wall reliefs were developed in three periods: 1963 to 1967, 1973 to 1974, and 1978 to the present. There are now more than 200 pieces in the series. Edwards believes the series is metaphorical of the struggles experienced by African Americans. A variety of metal objects including <b>hammer</b> heads, scissors, <b>locks,</b> chains and railroad splices, are employed as the raw materials for these works. The sculptures, usually no more than a foot tall, are hung on the wall at eye level. One critic noted [...] "their brutish power conjures the instruments used to subjugate African Americans during centuries of slavery and oppression." [...] Edwards is also known for his large public sculpture, smaller freestanding works, the kinetic [...] "Rockers" [...] series, and works executed in the medium of printmaking. His large-scale works include [...] "Mt.

40|$|M. Ing. Safety {{within the}} mining {{industry}} is a primary concern for everyone involved. More specifically, active below-ground stope support for South African Mines is becoming increasingly important due to a renewed emphasis on the safety and well-being of the people actually working underground. It is imperative that all stope support systems are rigorously tested, continuously, both under laboratory conditions and in-situ to prove their performance and manufacturing standards. The Rocprop was initially manufactured in 1995 with the first two hundred props being installed at East Driefontein Consolidated Gold Mine in the Carletonville area. In the three years since the first introduction over three hundred thousand Rocprops have been manufactured and sold to South African Mines with the number steadily increasing. The Rocprop is a tubular support consisting of two tubes — a Ø 139 mm 'inner' tube and a Ø 152 mm 'outer' tube. One end of each tube is sealed by dome ends which are welded onto the tube mouths. The two tubes, cut to identical lengths, fit inside one another and extend telescopically during installation. Once the desired height has been reached, leaving enough tube overlapping to ensure the support does not buckle, the wedge is <b>hammered</b> in <b>locking</b> the prop at that height. The water is then removed after which the prop will provide active support of the rock mass above it. One of the components responsible for the Rocprops success is a dome end. This is either a forging or a pressing welded onto {{each end of the}} support and allows continual concentric loading throughout the life of the Rocprop. At present the dome ends are pressings, manufactured into hemispheres from 10 mm mild steel plate in one action. The reason for the Rocprop's success is its performance characteristics. It's all metal construction, ease of installation, reliability and predictability in both seismic and static conditions, fire resistance, blast resistant, economically viability and versatility have made the prop successful. Reasons for the research were to investigate the dome end forming process in general and to investigate current numerical analysis techniques ability to predict loads during manufacture, the final shape, spring-back and other local deformation areas. Also to investigate alternate manufacturing methods such as cold forming, which provides advantages such as better mechanical properties and higher structural capabilities. The use of alternate materials in the Rocprop manufacture has been an ongoing process for MSP, manufacturer and current licensee holder of the Rocprop. A substitute for the current dome end manufactured from mild steel was investigated. For the substitute to be viable the material should be stronger, weigh less and be cost effective. In depth knowledge about the forming of the dome end at various velocities was gathered, providing information for further optimisation of the component...|$|R
