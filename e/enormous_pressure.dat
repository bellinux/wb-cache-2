5|$|Western Middle School in Russiaville faced <b>enormous</b> <b>pressure</b> {{from many}} parents and faculty to deny White {{from the campus}} after his {{diagnosis}} became widely known. In the school of 360 total students, 117 parents and 50 teachers signed a petition encouraging school leaders to ban Ryan from school. Due to the widespread fear and ignorance of AIDS, the principal and later the school board succumbed to this pressure and prohibited re-admittance. The White family filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the decision. The Whites initially filed suit in the U.S. District Court in Indianapolis. The court, however, declined {{to hear the case}} until administrative appeals had been resolved. On November 25, an Indiana Department of Education officer ruled that the school must follow the Indiana Board of Health guidelines and that Ryan White must be allowed to attend school.|$|E
5|$|In October 1918, with victory near, Downes {{was confronted}} by his most serious medical crisis. Damascus {{contained}} over 3,000 sick and wounded Turkish soldiers, {{many of them in}} appalling condition. Downes appointed the DADMS of the Australian Mounted Division, Major W. Evans, as Principal Medical Officer of Damascus, and gave him orders to organise the medical arrangements, bury the dead and provide care for the living. The task was made more difficult by the poor communications and transport shortages, which hampered the delivery of supplies and evacuation of the hospitals; by shortages of medical units; and by the actions of Lieutenant Colonel T. E. Lawrence, who was more concerned with establishing the political authority of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca over Damascus. At this point the Desert Mounted Corps itself began to experience epidemic diseases, particularly of bronchopneumonia, cholera and malaria, putting the medical services under <b>enormous</b> <b>pressure.</b> Through extraordinary measures, including the diversion of lighthorsemen and motor vehicles to medical units, Downes managed to evacuate the sick to Beirut, and the crisis abated.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January, 57 planeloads arrived, {{bringing}} {{most of the}} 2/7th Infantry Battalion and {{the remainder}} of the 2/5th. Although subjected to small arms fire as they came in and unloaded, 40 aircraft made 66 trips the next day. Their cargo included two dismantled 25 pounder guns of the 2/1st Field Regiment with 688 rounds of ammunition, under the command of Captain R. J. Wise. These were landed in the morning and in action before noon, shelling a concentration of 300 enemy troops between the villages of Wandumi and Kaisenik. The Japanese were also engaged by Beaufighters of No. 30 Squadron RAAF flying close air support. Three Dakotas were damaged when one overshot the runway on landing and crashed into two others. One was repaired, but the other two were a total loss. One of the 46th Troop Carrier Squadron's pilots, Staff Sergeant William B. Teague was injured, losing a leg. Japanese attacks that day succeeded in reaching the corner of the airstrip but were forced to fall back under <b>enormous</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E

5|$|John played {{infrequently}} for Cardiff {{during the}} 1968/69 season, making just 14 appearances. Despite this he {{was available for}} all matches in the 1969 Five Nations Championship, again playing in each match paired with Edwards. The Welsh selectors had dropped five players from the previous Championship, and notable debutants in the team to face Scotland at Murrayfield on 1 February 1969 were J.P.R. Williams and Mervyn Davies. John scored his first international try in the encounter after charging down a kick and dummying his way over. Scotland, who were under <b>enormous</b> <b>pressure</b> from the kick-off, lost 17–3. When Ireland came to the Cardiff Arms Park in March the team was on a seven match unbeaten run, and were looking at taking the Grand Slam after defeating England, France and Scotland. It therefore {{came as a surprise}} at the ease with which the Welsh pack dominated. Wales won 24–11, with Dai Morris the stand-out Welsh player, though John also had one of his best matches, keeping pressure on the Irish with long touch kicks and scoring with a dropped goal. Despite out-scoring France in tries scored, the match at Stade Colombes ended in an 8–8 draw, preventing a Welsh Grand Slam, though a win in the final match to England would give Wales the Championship. The England decider is best remembered for Maurice Richards' four tries, but John too was on the scoresheet with a dropped goal and a try of his own. The game finished 30–9 to Wales, giving John his first Championship title and made him a Triple Crown winning player, as Wales had beaten all three other Home Nation teams.|$|E
5|$|The {{trust the}} Archduke placed in Schmitt was briefly {{interrupted}} in 1799 {{when he was}} connected, by rumor, to the 29 April assassination of the French delegates to the Congress of Rastatt. The assassination occurred as the delegation was leaving the city. The official investigation into the assassination placed <b>enormous</b> <b>pressure</b> on Schmitt, {{to such an extent}} that he briefly resigned as Charles' Chief of Staff, but he was quickly reinstated. On 1 March 1800, Schmitt was promoted to Feldmarschallleutnant, but later in that year, the Archduke was himself replaced as commander-in-chief by Field Marshal Pál Kray. Although Schmitt remained on Kray's staff, he again requested retirement, claiming he was tired and could no longer cope with the stress of the job. In reality, he and Kray's Quartermaster General, Generalmajor Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles, seldom saw eye-to-eye on any of the main issues facing the army and Kray relied more on Chasteler than on Schmitt. His request was initially refused, but on 19 August 1800, Emperor Francis II approved the petition when Kray seconded it. Schmitt went first to Vienna and then Hostitz at Kromeriz, near Brno. There he lived with his old friend Ferdinand Ritter von Geißlern until 1805.|$|E

25|$|In capital {{punishment}} cases, {{in order to}} {{rule out the possibility that}} police may have forced a confession, the secret must be something that the police investigation did not discover at the time of the confession.

In the event, Paxton's design fulfilled and surpassed all the requirements, and it proved to be vastly faster and cheaper to build than any other form of building of a comparable size. Indeed, his submission was budgeted at a remarkably low £85,800 - by comparison, this was only about 2-1/2 times more than the Great Stove at Chatsworth but it was only 28% of the estimated cost of Turner's design, and it promised a building which, with a footprint of over 770,000 sq.ft.

Everything had looked settled after special stage 18, with Latvala making a small mistake and losing the advantage he had gained at the previous stage, but the final thirty kilometre stage saw drama right to the end. Both the challengers to Hirvonen's lead were making significant inroads at the mid way split. Latvala was 4.3 seconds faster than Hirvonen, with Loeb 11.3 seconds faster and putting both Ford drivers under <b>enormous</b> <b>pressure</b> - pressure that was increased when Hirvonen suffered a puncture {{near the end of}} the stage.
