500|$|This {{version was}} put into several poems by the celebrated provocative poet Gabi Daniel (pseudonym of Benjamin Harushovsky-Harshav) and {{entitled}} [...] "Peter the Great". Themes in the poem include <b>dehumanisation</b> and how Ben-Gurion got Shoah into his pocket, {{by the work of}} the other [...] "innocent young Jews of the Superior Race, who, without name or vision, found themselves the saviours of Israel".|$|E
500|$|DelFattore {{outlines}} {{the use of}} double adjectives to reinforce feelings towards enemies in both his war stories and thrillers, such as [...] "filthy, murdering Boche", and [...] "stinking, cowardly Bolshevik". She and the scholar Lise Jaillant also comment on the <b>dehumanisation</b> of the enemy, comparing them to animals and vermin. Watson noted {{the frequency of the}} use of the word [...] "devil"—and variations—when discussing antagonists.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinion of}} Quatermass 2 {{in the years}} since its release remains divided. Writing in Science Fiction in the Cinema, John Baxter found the film “a {{faithful}} but ponderous adaptation of Kneale's TV sequel. There are effective sequences, director Guest and cameraman Gerald Gibbs shooting with light lancing up through the shadows in a manner reminiscent of Jacques Tourneur's Night (or Curse) of the Demon. Otherwise the film is indifferent”. Similarly, John Brosnan, in his book The Primal Screen, wrote that “Quatermass 2 isn't as good as the first one, despite a bigger budget. Again the theme is possession (all four Quatermass stories are variations on the same theme) with Kneale again cleverly mixing sf with the supernatural. The alien invasion may be sf but it is presented with the trappings of traditional horror, such as the V-shaped [...] "mark of the devil" [...] that all possessed people display”. On the other hand, Bill Warren, in Keep Watching The Skies!, found Quatermass 2 to be “one of the best science fiction films of the 1950s. It is not notably better than , but the story idea is more involving, the production is livelier and there are more events in the unfolding of the story”. Kim Newman in 1986 praised the film as [...] "extraordinary" [...] and, comparing it to Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), Newman notes that while Don Siegel’s film is [...] "a general allegory" [...] about <b>dehumanisation</b> and conformity, Quatermass 2 is “a specific attack on the Conservative Government of the time, down to the inclusion of several characters obviously based on real political figures”.|$|E
2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of the war, in July 1936, the ideological nature of the Nationalist fight against the Loyalists indicated the degree of <b>dehumanisation</b> of the lower social classes (peasants and workers) {{in the view of the}} politically-reactionary sponsors of the nationalist forces, the Roman Catholic Church of Spain, the aristocracy, the landowners, and the military, commanded by General Francisco Franco. Captain Gonzalo de Aguilera y Munro, a public affairs officer for the Nationalist forces, told the American reporter John Thompson Whitaker: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} play is a political drama showing how the individual is destroyed by a higher power. [...] "Each of Harold Pinter's [...] four plays ends in the virtual annihilation of an individual.... It is by his bitter dramas of <b>dehumanisation</b> that he implies [...] "the importance of humanity". The religion and society, which have traditionally structured human morality, are, in Pinter's plays, the immoral agents that destroy the individual." [...] Pinter supported the interpretation of The Birthday Party and The Dumb Waiter as [...] "political plays about power and victimisation".|$|E
2500|$|The vagina and vulva have {{additionally}} been termed many vulgar names, {{three of}} which are cunt, twat, and pussy. Cunt {{is used as a}} derogatory epithet referring to people of either sex. This usage is relatively recent, dating from the late nineteenth century. Reflecting different national usages, cunt is described as [...] "an unpleasant or stupid person" [...] in the Compact Oxford English Dictionary, whereas Merriam-Webster has a usage of the term as [...] "usually disparaging and obscene: woman", noting that it is used in the U.S. as [...] "an offensive way to refer to a woman"; and the Macquarie Dictionary of Australian English states that it is [...] "a despicable man". When used with a positive qualifier (good, funny, clever, etc.) in Britain, New Zealand and Australia, it can convey a positive sense of the object or person referred to. Some feminists of the 1970s sought to eliminate disparaging terms such as [...] "cunt". In the context of pornography, Catharine MacKinnon argued that use of the word acts to reinforce a <b>dehumanisation</b> of women by reducing them to mere body parts. [...] "Twat" [...] is widely used as a derogatory epithet, especially in British English, referring to a person considered obnoxious or stupid. Pussy can indicate [...] "cowardice or weakness", and [...] "the human vulva or vagina" [...] or by extension [...] "sexual intercourse with a woman". |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}} In contemporary English, use of the word pussy to refer to women is considered derogatory or demeaning, treating people as sexual objects.|$|E

5000|$|Drones is {{a concept}} album about the <b>dehumanisation</b> of modern warfare. The story begins with [...] "Dead Inside", where the protagonist loses hope and becomes {{vulnerable}} to the dark forces of [...] "Psycho". He eventually defects, revolts and overcomes his enemies.|$|E

50|$|Scream or Wounded Man (1990-1993, {{polyester}} with patina) - {{the sculpture}} represents the last hopeless scream of a wounded man against the <b>dehumanisation</b> {{of him as}} well as his torturers. The author compared the statue to Bosnia and its people being hollowed out in the war, which was then in full swing, with only scorched shells remaining.|$|E

In {{the context of}} pornography, Catharine MacKinnon argued that {{use of the word}} acts to reinforce a <b>dehumanisation</b> of women by reducing them to mere body parts; and in 1979 Andrea Dworkin described the word as reducing women to [...] "the one essential - 'cunt: our essence ... our offence'".|$|E
5000|$|... "However useful the Pathway {{may be in}} {{individual}} cases properly applied, incentivised and managerialised death targets become problematic {{in the context of}} uncertain diagnosis, a steadily ageing population, spiralling healthcare costs, and the philosophical <b>dehumanisation</b> of the vulnerable pervasive in contemporary bioethics. The targets themselves constitute improper pressure on healthcare professionals’ employment and livelihood. As such, they are likely to invite and rationalise grave human rights abuse with tragic consequences for the defenceless incapacitated in hospitals and care homes." ...|$|E
50|$|Religious {{persecution}} may {{be triggered}} by religious bigotry (i.e. members of a dominant group denigrating religions other than their own) or by the state when it views a particular religious group {{as a threat to}} its interests or security. At a societal level, this <b>dehumanisation</b> of a particular religious group may readily turn into violence or other forms of persecution. Indeed, in many countries, religious persecution has resulted in so much violence that it is considered a human rights problem.|$|E

50|$|The {{paintings}} of Pejić are much darker {{and full of}} symbols than his sculptures. Through years, his works became ever more expressive. Colours gradually became purer and more intensive. He centred his work on a fight against the loss of human virtues and the <b>dehumanisation</b> of man. Pejić's paintings were much influenced by his sculpture work. There is no single redundant stroke there. Colors were squeezed directly from tubes and mixed on canvas. He started the images with brushes and finished them with fingers and hands.|$|E

5000|$|His {{experiences}} in prison {{led him to}} write Darkness at Noon and newspaper articles campaigning for the abolition of capital punishment in the 1950s. He also attempted to change the experience of incarceration, stating that in prison, [...] "the main problem is apathy, depression and gradual <b>dehumanisation.</b> The spark dies." [...] Koestler spoke of being intellectually under-stimulated and terrorized in prison, and wanted to provide [...] "an imaginative and exciting way to stimulate {{as far as possible}} and in many cases as possible the mind and spirit of the prisoner." ...|$|E
5000|$|Aalaap mein girah (Literal 'Nodule in Prelude') is {{the first}} volume of his poems. It {{received}} good reviews after its publication. Renowned Hindi poet Vishnu Khare wrote, Geet is among the few Hindi poets who watch the lumpenisation and <b>dehumanisation</b> of Indian society with a keen eye. With the poems {{about the state of the}} nation and the individual, he has emerged as an unfazed realistic poet. [...] Chaturvedi was awarded the Bharat Bhushan Agrawal Award in 2007. His poetry has been translated into seventeen languages. He is known for his mesmerizing readings of his poems.|$|E
50|$|Malzberg's writing {{style is}} distinctive, {{frequently}} employing long, elaborate sentences with few commas. Most of his science fiction books are short, present-tense narratives concerned exclusively with {{the consciousness of}} a single obsessive character. His themes, particularly in the novels Beyond Apollo (1972) and The Falling Astronauts (1971) about the US space exploration programme, include the <b>dehumanisation</b> effects of bureaucracy and technology; his treatment of these themes sometimes exhibits strong resemblances to Franz Kafka, accompanied by Unreliable narrator techniques. In novels like Galaxies (1975) and Herovit's World (1973), Malzberg uses metafiction techniques to subject the heroic conventions and literary limitations of space opera to biting satire.|$|E
5000|$|Friedrich has {{specifically}} {{attempted to}} claim the position of an objective historian, making no judgement about the morality of Allied bombing. [...] Many reviews of his books {{have pointed out that}} the language Friedrich uses in his books, with words such as [...] "Einsatzgruppen" [...] (task force in English) used to describe allied pilots and [...] "crematoria" [...] (as in the crematoria of Auschwitz) to describe the air raid shelters in which Dresden residents died. This has led to accusations that Friedrich [...] "is downright reckless" [...] and is attempting to make the reader consider a parallel to [...] "the Nazi <b>dehumanisation</b> of the Jews.".|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} a {{character}} assassination driven by an individual is not {{equal to that of}} a state-driven campaign.The state-sponsored destruction of reputations, fostered by political propaganda and cultural mechanisms, can have more far-reaching consequences. One of the earliest signs of a society's compliance to loosening the reins on the perpetration of crimes (and even massacres) with total impunity is when a government favors or directly encourages a campaign aimed at destroying the dignity and reputation of its adversaries, and the public accepts its allegations without question. The mobilisation toward ruining the reputation of adversaries is the prelude to the mobilisation of violence in order to annihilate them. Official <b>dehumanisation</b> has always preceded the physical assault of the victims.|$|E
5000|$|In an order, the Supreme Court {{mentioned}} that people take arms for survival and against inhuman implementation of law depriving the weak, and not senselessly. The court {{pointed out the}} importance of formalised state police actions, in ways that do not ignore Constitutional values: [...] "Given humanity's collective experience with unchecked power, which becomes its own principle and its practice its own raison d'etre, resulting in the eventual <b>dehumanisation</b> of all the people, the scouring of the earth by the unquenchable thirst for natural resources by imperialist powers, and the horrors of two World Wars, modern Constitutionalism posits that no wielder of power {{should be allowed to}} claim the right to perpetrate the state's violence against any one, much less its own citizens, unchecked by law, and notions of innate human dignity of every individual." ...|$|E
5000|$|Similarities between {{wage labour}} and slavery were noted {{as early as}} Cicero in Ancient Rome. With {{the advent of the}} {{industrial}} revolution, thinkers such as Proudhon and Marx elaborated the comparison between wage labour and slavery {{in the context of a}} critique of societal property not intended for active personal use, while Luddites emphasised the <b>dehumanisation</b> brought about by machines. Before the American Civil War, Southern defenders of African American slavery invoked the concept of wage slavery to favorably compare the condition of their slaves to workers in the North. The United States abolished slavery during the Civil War, but labor union activists found the metaphor useful. According to Lawrence Glickman, in the Gilded Age, [...] "References abounded in the labor press, and it is hard to find a speech by a labour leader without the phrase." ...|$|E
50|$|Despite the Christian idealism of La mission civilisatrice (the civilising mission), {{from the}} start of colonialisation in 1858, the French {{exploited}} the land of Viet Nam as inexhaustible and the Viet people as beasts of burden. During the First Indochina War (1946-54) the French justified their colonial re-subjugation of Viet Nam as defence of the white West against the péril jaune - specifically the Viet Communists, who were puppets of Red China in communist conspiracy to conquer the world. Hence, French orientalism defined the Asian Other as less-than-human; combined with anti-communism, that <b>dehumanisation</b> allowed atrocities against Viet Minh prisoners of war, during la sale guerre, the dirty war against international communism. The Yellow Peril metaphors in French anti-communist media portrayed the Viet Minh as part of the innombrables masses jaunes (innumerable yellow hordes) and one of many vagues hurlantes (roaring waves) of masses fanatisées (fanatical hordes).|$|E
50|$|The {{middle of}} the 19th century saw The Great Exhibition of 1851, the first World's Fair, which showcased the {{greatest}} innovations of the century. At its centre was the Crystal Palace, a modular glass and iron structure - {{the first of its}} kind. It was condemned by Ruskin as the very model of mechanical <b>dehumanisation</b> in design but later came to be presented as the prototype of Modern architecture. The emergence of photography, showcased at the Great Exhibition, resulted in significant changes in Victorian art with Queen Victoria being the first British monarch to be photographed. John Everett Millais was influenced by photography (notably in his portrait of Ruskin) as were other Pre-Raphaelite artists. It later became associated with the Impressionistic and Social Realist techniques that would dominate the later years of the period in the work of artists such as Walter Sickert and Frank Holl.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{programme}} {{explored the}} lives and works of Mark Gertler, Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Walter Sickert, Wyndham Lewis, Lawrence Atkinson, David Bomberg, Richard Nevinson, Paul Nash and Stanley Spencer. The second programme explored the works of John Nash, Stanley Spencer, Alfred Munnings, William Coldstream, Paul Nash and John Piper. In the third programme, subtitled 'A New Jerusalem,' Fox explored British art {{in the aftermath of}} the 2nd world war, and examined the works of Lucian Freud, Graham Sutherland, [...] Francis Bacon, Richard Hamilton, David Hockney and Keith Vaughan. In this final programme of the series Fox explored how the themes of evil, brutality, <b>dehumanisation,</b> consumerism and optimism can be seen in the works of these postwar artists. Fox contends in this programme that the death of Lucian Freud and the emergence of conceptual art have marginalised, eclipsed and brought to an end the tradition of British figurative painting.|$|E
5000|$|No {{matter how}} {{sophisticated}} autonomous weapons systems are, {{they can never}} comply with international human rights law. [...] "Meaningful human involvement is absolutely essential in decisions affecting {{the life and death}} of human beings," [...] Archbishop Tomasi, told experts meeting 13-16 May to discuss lethal autonomous weapons systems such as drones. Archbishop Tomasi said it was essential [...] "to recognise that autonomous weapon systems can never replace the human capacity for moral reasoning, including in the context of war." [...] "The development of autonomous weapon systems will ultimately lead to widespread proliferation," [...] he said, and [...] "the development of complex autonomous weapon systems which remove the human actor from lethal decision-making is short-sighted and may irreversibly alter the nature of warfare in a less humane direction, leading to consequences we cannot possibly foresee, but that will in any case increase the <b>dehumanisation</b> of warfare." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the praxis of colonialism, {{the native}} populace {{constitute}} the Other whom the colonizers mean to dominate {{in order to}} civilise and save them {{in the course of}} exploiting the natural and human resources of the natives' homeland. As such, a colony is a way to dominate and dispose of two groups of people (colonists and colonised) who can be used to define the Other. The practice of Othering establishes the unequal relationship between the native people and the colonizers, who believe themselves essentially superior to the natives whom they reduced to inhuman inferiority, as [...] "the Other". The <b>dehumanisation</b> of colonialism—the colonist [...] "Self" [...] against the colonised [...] "Other"—is maintained with the false binary-relations of social class and race, of sex and gender, and of nation and religion. The proper, profitable functioning of a colony features continual protection of such cultural demarcations, which establish and enforce the socio-economic binary relation between [...] "civilized man" [...] (the colonist) and [...] "savage man" [...] (the colonial subaltern).|$|E
5000|$|Racial Fetishism as {{a culture}} is often perceived, in this context, as an act or belief {{motivated}} by sexual racism. The objectification and reductionist perception of different races, for example, East Asian women, or African American men, relies greatly on their portrayal in forms of media that depict them as sexual objects. An {{example of such a}} medium includes Pornography. An instance of this hypersexualisation is commented upon in Artist and Designer Donna Choi’s illustrative series targeting the specific fetishisation of Asian women, named, Does Your Man Suffer From Yellow Fever? (2013). In said illustration, Choi uses satire to depict a white man’s harmful perception of a [...] "china doll stereotype" [...] towards Asian woman and how she is an object to his desires. Choi’s intention comes across through implying the presence of an obvious <b>dehumanisation</b> of Asian women in the eyes of another race. This is a deliberate commentary on the fetishisation rooted within the social issue of Sexual Racism.|$|E
5000|$|In 1975 the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe {{published}} an essay, [...] "An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness'", which provoked controversy by calling Conrad a [...] "thoroughgoing racist". Achebe's {{view was that}} Heart of Darkness cannot be considered a great work of art because it is [...] "a novel which celebrates... <b>dehumanisation,</b> which depersonalises {{a portion of the}} human race." [...] Referring to Conrad as a [...] "talented, tormented man", Achebe notes that Conrad (via the protagonist, Charles Marlow) reduces and degrades Africans to [...] "limbs", [...] "angles", [...] "glistening white eyeballs", etc. while simultaneously (and fearfully) suspecting a common kinship between himself and these natives—leading Marlow to sneer the word [...] "ugly." [...] Achebe also cited Conrad's description of an encounter with an African: [...] "A certain enormous buck nigger encountered in Haiti fixed my conception of blind, furious, unreasoning rage, as manifested in the human animal to the end of my days." [...] Achebe's essay, a landmark in postcolonial discourse, provoked debate, and the questions it raised have been addressed in most subsequent literary criticism of Conrad.|$|E
