40|$|Abstract Background The human {{leukocyte}} antigens (HLAs) are proteins {{found in}} the membranes of nearly all nucleated cells. People with certain HLA antigens {{are more likely to}} develop certain autoimmune diseases. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the frequency of HLA-DRB 1 in children with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) as a risk factor for occurrence, its relation to preceding hepatitis A infection and treatment outcome. Subjects and methods 25 children with AIH were subjected to HLA-DRB 1 typing performed by sequence specific oligonucleotide probe technique and compared to HLA-DRB 1 found in 548 normal populations. Results The most frequent alleles found in our children with AIH were HLA-DRB 1 * 13 (36 %), HLA-DRB 1 * 04 (18 %) and HLA-DRB 1 * 03 (14 %). HLA-DRB 1 * 13 was significantly more frequent in AIH patients compared to controls. In type I AIH patients HLA-DRB 1 * 13 was the most frequent allele (32. 4 %), followed by HLA-DRB 1 * 04 in (20. 6 %) and HLA-DRB 1 * 03 in (14. 7 %), While in type II, the most frequent alleles were HLA-DRB 1 * 13 in (40 %), HLA-DRB 1 * 07 (20 %) and HLA-DRB 1 * 15 in (20 %). HLA-DRB 1 * 12 was significantly more frequent in AIH patients with positive <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>IgM</b> than in patients with negative <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>IgM.</b> No statistically significant difference between partial responders and complete responders to treatment as regards HLA-DRB 1 subtypes. Conclusion It is concluded from the previous study that HLA-DRB 1 * 13 may be a susceptibility allele for the occurrence of autoimmune hepatitis in our population. HLA-DRB 1 * 07 and HLA-DRB 1 * 15 may be susceptibility alleles for occurrence of autoimmune hepatitis type 2. HLA-DRB 1 * 12 association with AIH in patients triggered by hepatitis A needs further studies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Hepatitis A {{infection}} {{is an important}} public health problem in our country. However, its endemicity pattern has been changing in recent years both worldwide and in our country. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the seroprevalence of Hepatitis A infection among 2 - 6 year-old children of low socioeconomic class families. Material and Methods: This study was conducted on children of low socioeconomic class families who were expected to experience hepatitis A infection early in their life. <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>IgM</b> and IgG antibody levels were determined on 736 children from 2 to 6 years old. Results: Three hundred and fifty-two were female and 384 were male among the 736 children. Ig G antibodies were found to be positive in 26 (3. 5 %) children. Conclusions: We recommend vaccination of children at preschool age. However, further epidemiologic studies are necessary concerning different socioeconomic levels. Following the results it may be possible to vaccinate children without determining antibody status if hepatitis A seropositivity is determined to be low at this age...|$|E

The ELISA was shown to be specific and sensitive giving good discrimination between acute and late convalescent hepatitis A sera. It was proposed that the same cut-off control as is used in the RIA (equivalent to 10 RIA units) should be adopted for the ELISA also. The ability to detect specific IgM class antibodies is of great diagnostic value in clinical virology espe-cially when the pathogen concerned is difficult to isolate and culture.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the current age-related hepatitis A virus (HAV) seroprevalance, vaccination status of children and to evaluate the epidemiological shift in HAV serostatus living in Tekirdağ, which is located in Thrace region, the European part of Turkey. Methods: Children 6 months- 12 years of age with simple health problems were included. Blood samples were studied for HAV IgM and IgG collectively. A questionnaire addressing several characteristics of subjects was administered to obtain basic descriptive data on HAV epidemiology. Vaccination status of the children was recorded according to the immunization cards. Findings: The overall anti-HAV IgM and anti-HAV IgG prevalance in children aged 6 months – 12 years was 3. 3 % and 25. 4 % respectively. Maximum <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>IgM</b> positivity was in the 7 - 12 years age group 4. 8 % (n= 12; P< 0. 001) and maximum hepatitis A IgG positivity in the same age group was 34 % (n= 85; P< 0. 001). HAV vaccination rate among patients aged more than 2 years was 11. 03 %.

Because acute viral <b>hepatitis</b> has <b>a</b> wide clinical spectrum, {{we tested the}} hypothesis that many cases are undetected because of mild illness caused by initial, early-childhood exposure to hepatitis viruses. Methods. During active case detection among 20, 000 inhabitants of rural villages in Egypt, we screened 1715 symptomatic patients for serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Viral hepatitis markers were tested in 47 subjects who had ALT levels that were least twice the normal level. Results. Of the 47 individuals tested, 4 children aged 3 – 5 years had immunoglobulin M (<b>IgM)</b> antibodies to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> virus (anti-HAV <b>IgM).</b> One also had a possible false-positive result to <b>a</b> test for <b>IgM</b> antibodies to hepatitis E virus.

40|$|Abstract. Selective {{immunization}} {{of at-risk}} groups {{may reduce the}} incidence of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> infection, but only the inclusion of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccine in a routine universal childhood immunization schedule would guarantee control of the infection. But the interference by maternally derived <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> antibodies (anti-HAV) with the immunogenicity of inactivated <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccine is still important in the determination of the optimal age for <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccination. The <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccines have not been assessed widely in {{children under the age of}} 2 years and are not currently licensed for this age group in many countries. A prospective trial was performed to detect seroprevalence of maternal <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> antibodies during the first 2 years of life among young infants born to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> antibody positive mothers in Turkey. We measured at-birth anti-HAV in 147 infants born in our hospital and in their mothers and then from the offspring a...|$|R

In 45 % of patients {{the presence of}} <b>an</b> <b>IgM</b> band {{was associated with a}} number of other diagnoses. The finding of <b>an</b> <b>IgM</b> band at the dermo-epidermal junction in a cutaneous biopsy is not sufficient evidence to make a diagnosis of lupus erythematosus without supporting clinical, histological and serological evidence...|$|R

40|$|Acute {{hepatitis}} due to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> {{virus is}} usually a benign selflimiting disease during childhood. Although many viral infections such as hepatitis B virus, Parvovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus are associated with extrahepatic autoimmune phenomena, such manifestations are rare in patients with acute <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> infection. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is rarely reported {{as a manifestation of}} acute <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A.</b> We report 11 -year-old boy with immune thrombocytopenic purpura as the sole manifestation of anicteric acute <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> infection.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the impact {{and effectiveness of}} risk-group vaccination against <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> targeted at migrant children living {{in a country with}} low endemicity of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A.</b> METHODS: Retrospective population based data analysis. Routinely collected data on <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> incidence in migrant children and other risk groups in Amsterdam from 1 January 1992 to 2004 were analyzed and related to exposure, immunity and vaccination coverage in migrant children. RESULTS: The overall <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> incidence in Amsterdam declined after a pediatric vaccine was introduced in 1997. This decline was seen in migrant children traveling to hepatitis A-endemic countries, contacts with <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> patients, primary school students, injecting drug users, and persons with unknown source of infection, but not in {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) or in travelers to endemic countries other than migrant children. CONCLUSION: The <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccination campaigns are effective: they reduce both import and secondary HAV cases. The campaigns could be more efficient and cost-effective if the hepatitis B vaccinations currently given to these groups were replaced by <b>a</b> combined <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> and B vaccine. This would increase the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccination coverage considerably and further reduce the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> incidenc...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> is <b>a</b> common acute <b>hepatitis</b> {{caused by}} <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> virus (HAV). Annually, it affects 1. 4 million people worldwide. Between 1991 and 1994, HAV infections were highly endemic in Zhejiang Province (China), with 78, 720 {{reported}} HAV infections per year. <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccine {{came on the}} market in 1995 and was implemented for voluntary immunization. Since 2008, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccine has been integrated into the national childhood routine immunization program. To understand the current epidemiological profile of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> in Zhejiang Province since <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccine has been available for nearly two decades. This study used the 2005 - 2014 National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System data to evaluate the incidence rate of notified <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> cases in Zhejiang Province. The overall trend of incidence rate of notified <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> cases significantly decreased from 2005 to 2014 (P< 0. 001). During the study period, the reported incidence rate in individuals aged ≤ 19 years declined to the historically lowest record in 2014. Compared with individuals aged ≤ 19 years, those aged ≥ 20 years showed the highest incidence rate (P< 0. 001). Majority of HAV infected cases were Laborers, accounting for approximately 70 % of reported cases. Childhood immunization strategy with <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccine seemed to be effective in decreasing notified <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> incidence rate in individuals aged ≤ 19 years. Those aged ≥ 20 years were observed to be the most susceptible population. The vast majority of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> cases were notified among Laborers. Therefore, we strongly suggest that future preventive and control measures should focus more on adults, particularly Laborers, in addition to the current childhood <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccination programme...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Most {{patients}} with acute viral <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> have a favorable course, {{but a few}} of them suffer from severe forms of hepatitis such as fulminant hepatitis. This study was carried out to identify the factors influencing the severity of acute viral <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A.</b> Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 713 {{patients with}} acute <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A,</b> who were divided into two groups: severe <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> (N= 87) and non-severe <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> (N= 626). Severe hepatitis was defined as fulminant hepatitis or prolongation of prothrombin time (INR≥ 1. 5). Clinical variables were compared between the two groups. Results: The incidence of fulminant hepatitis was 1. 4 % (10 / 713) in patients with acute <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A.</b> Thirty-three (4. 6 %) cases exhibited HBsAg positivity. In multivariate analyses, significant alcohol intake and the presence of HBsAg were significant predictive factors of fulminant <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A,</b> and significant alcohol intake and age were significant predictive factors of severe <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A.</b> HBeAg and HBV-DNA status did not affect the clinical course of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> in chronic <b>hepatitis</b> B carriers. Conclusions: While most patients with acute <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> have an uncomplicated clinical course, our data suggest that a more-severe clinical course is correlated with being older, significant alcohol intake, and chronic hepatitis-B-virus infection.
