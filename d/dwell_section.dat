The arguments of biological vs societal reasons for such gender differences are presented and the kibbutz society is offered as a setting to test the rivaling hypotheses. It is argued that the kibbutz society offers more similar roles for both genders than outside the kibbutz and therefore the gender differences in LE should be reduced in comparison to what is expected, given the very high LE of kibbutz members. Statistical data of the kibbutz population between the years 1975 - 1980 are analyzed and the results support the following conclusions: female members have higher LE but the difference is much less than expected {{on the basis of}} a regression analysis of data from 73 societies; the difference is smaller due to the relatively higher gain in LE by males; the gender differences are even smaller at age 50 compared to LE differences at birth. The Discussion <b>section</b> <b>dwells</b> upon interpretations of the findings and argues against alternative interpretations that assume selection processes for the kibbutz population.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to launch a debate on a broader meaning of the term 'innovation' and its {{significance}} for local and regional development. Innovation and related economic and social categories have been at the centre of policy discussions on the future of the European economy and society. Reflections on the innovative and learning region (Territorial Innovation Models; TIMs) have underpinned regional and local development policies. Yet dissatisfaction with the technologist and market-competition-led development concept of the TIMs is growing and today its shortcomings are well known. But to formulate an alternative based on a different ontology requires a multidimensional reflection on the pillars of territorial development. The first section briefly refers to the critical evaluations of the literature on regional innovation and the so-called Territorial Innovation Models. The second section returns to basic questions about the meaning of regional economic development and innovation. It puts forward community development based on social innovation as an alternative to market-led territorial development. The third section examines the consequences of the community ontology for the definition of a number of basic concepts. Categories such as capital, knowledge, learning, evolution, culture and so on receive a different meaning in a model where the economic is only one dimension of the overall dynamics of community development. The fourth section integrates the role of power relations and the articulation between various spatial scales and institutional settings into the community-development approach. The final <b>section</b> <b>dwells</b> on the consequences of this community-oriented territorial approach for contemporary research agendas on local and regional development policies and strategies. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Emotion {{recognition}} {{has been}} widely discussed among society since 1990 ’s. Implementing user’s emotion recognition system would be ideal as it can raise the emotional awareness among Facebook users. Facebook users are allowed to reveal their emotions via their post of status without restrictions. Through this emotion mining, Facebook user’s post of status will be utilized to analyze the emotional condition of user along certain period of time. This system also provides appropriate recommendations for the users according to the results gained from the system. With this, Facebook users will be more aware of handling their emotions which can decrease the risk of negative impact from negative emotions. This system will also provide emotion detection by Facebook user’s friends towards his/her post of status by assessing the replies of the friends. With this, Facebook user can quickly recognize about the feelings of his/her friends towards the message. In order to accomplish this project, a lot of related researches on existing emotion mining system and emotions need to be studied to gain {{the accuracy of the}} system results. In this study, we have studied on the emotion related keywords from past researchers. We include four main emotional states in the system which includes the state of happy, sad, angry and neutral. We also have to identify the most suitable method to be used to recognize Facebook user’s emotion. The following <b>section</b> <b>dwells</b> on the findings of the study. With the information gathered we then design a web-based emotion mining system that is suitable for the Facebook users.

40|$|The {{central role}} played by normativity in pragmatism has become in the past years a center of renewed {{interest}} from different sides. Not only the pragmatist scholarship has recently produced new studies in ethics (LaFollette 2000; Pappas 2008; de Waal and Skowronki 2012; Frega 2012), but also thinkers trained in the analytic tradition came to endorse some of the pragmatist views on normativity {{in relation to the}} pragmatics and semantics of language. In particular, Robert B. Brandom defends a form of “inferentialism” according to which, roughly put, the meaning of a proposition is given by the normative function that that proposition plays within an inference (e. g. 2000; see Thibaud 1997; Pape 2009). The aim of my dissertation is {{to go back to the}} tenets of two central figures of the so-called classic American pragmatism, namely, Charles S. Peirce and John Dewey, in order to point out in which ways the problem of normativity emerges in the womb of human agency and experience. As a consequence, my perspective is broader than contemporary inferentialism in semantics, since it includes topics such as the nature of the human actor, the problem of ethical normativity, the constitution of the objects of experience, the nature of truth, and some others. The choice to circumscribe my analysis to Peirce and Dewey is due to both scholarly and theoretical reasons: first, not much work has been done to identify the specific problems related to normativity on which both Peirce and Dewey focus (see however Colapietro 2004 b; Pihlstrom 2004); second, I believe that Peirce and Dewey are the two authors within the tradition of classic pragmatism who better developed, in the light of a strong pragmatic epistemology, the problem of the different figures that normativity assumes in human experience. As a consequence, authors such as William James, Josiah Royce, George H. Mead and Clarence I. Lewis are only mentioned when needed, but never studied directly. It is the reader’s onus to find out at the end of this dissertation whether the choice of the author’s is flawed or not. As Vincent M. Colapietro insightfully observes, “Dewey saw his own work in logic as an extension of Peirce’s efforts in this field” (2004 b: 107). I would subscribe one further remark in Colapietro’s article, in which we read that “for Dewey, no less than for Peirce … it is more appropriate to speak of a semiotic turn rather than the linguistic turn, a turn toward signs in all of their variety and not just toward that form of symbolization so prominent in our lives” that is “language” narrowly taken (2004 b: 112). Thus, a broad semeiotic approach constitutes the common ground for both Peirce and Dewey. Working on the assumption that this approach is correct, I will show its many implications in developing Peirce’s and Dewey’s theory of human agency, experience and normativity. My aim is not to develop a point-to-point comparison between the two authors’ tenets, rather to show that they addressed the same questions and worked with a pragmatically semeiotic approach. I proceed as follows. Chapter 1 aims to provide a theory of the human individual understood as an agent on the basis of Peirce’s reflections on the notions of “individual,” “self-consciousness” and “developmental teleology. ” In particular, my analysis moves from an appraisal of how Peirce scholarship has struggled with a confused account of the notion of individuality in the so-called “philosophies of process,” including not only Peirce’s philosophy but also Dewey’s. By arguing against those interpretations that take Peirce to be a nihilist about the human individual, I try to offer a different reading in which Peirce’s alleged “intellectual embarrassment” about the concept of individuality is actually the mark of a complex and sound account of that notion. The chapter is divided in three parts, in which I develop the three ideas that represent the three aspects of Peirce’s understanding of the individual human agent. These three ideas are: (1) “individual” = the continuity of each, unique series of spatio-temporal instantiations of bundles of habits; (2) “individual” = the human being as able of self-consciousness and psychological self-ascriptions; (3) “individual” = the human being as called to a unique mission in the ongoing process of creation. The section on Peirce’s theory of individual objects aims to show that the only possible way to make sense of Peirce’s theory of individuals is in the light of his three universal categories, 1 stness, 2 ndness and 3 rdness, understood in their semeiotic, phaneroscopic and metaphysical meanings. In particular, I try to underscore that different notions used by Peirce (such as “actual fact,” “permanent fact,” “subject,” “existence quasi-existence,” “influx” relation) are meant to describe from different viewpoints the reality of an individual as a modal organism, in which actuality (2 ndness, “will-be”), possibility (1 stness, “might-be”) and non-deterministic necessity (3 rdness, “would-be”) are all constitutive and irreducible elements. The question that remains open in this section is the following: if it is true that a series of instantiations is unified by the general laws that govern it, and if it is true that an entity is a bundle of habits, what is that provides a bundle of habits with its unity? The answer can be found, I believe, in Peirce’s theory of final causality, which is reintroduced by him in every field of knowledge. I focus on Peirce’s theory of final causality in the third section of this chapter, with particular attention to its realization in the life of the human being. The second <b>section</b> <b>dwells</b> upon Peirce’s account of self-consciousness on the basis of first-person, indexical self-referential statements (or all statements that can be transformed into first-person statements). In so doing, I sketch Peirce’s semeiotic classification of the types on indices, with particular attention to the personal pronoun “I. ” I try to show how the conditions of use of “I” are fulfilled not only by some weak experiences, usually mentioned by Peirce scholarship in order to account for Peirce’s tenets (e. g. the experiences of linguistic testimonies and error), but also by two stronger cases of “perception,” i. e. the consciousness of the present and the sense of effort in agency (which I name conjointly the “present&effort-perception”). Thus, I also reconstruct Peirce’s account of perception as the basic epistemic unity of experience. The conclusion is that the present&effort-perception represents the informational index (almost pure index, “reagent”) on the basis of which the possibility of self-referential statements with monstrative indices (e. g. “I”) emerges. For reasons that will be clear in the chapter, the presence of something like the present&effort-perception guarantees that our belief in a “private self” or “I” has an existent object and not only a hypothetical object in a Logical Universe. I conclude the section with some remarks on Peirce’s partial rejection of Kant’s “I think” and on a interpretative issue present in Peirce scholarship on the nature of corporate personalities, i. e., higher-order persons such as nations, corporations, churches, etc. On this second point, I argue against those interpretations that take Peirce’s defense of the reality of higher-order personalities to imply the belief in the reality of higher-order self-consciousnesses. The third section focuses on Peirce’s tenet that human individuality is further grounded in the strong teleological nature of the human being. The human being is called to realize a unique mission or function in the ongoing process of creation. Such a “mission” is the final cause that unifies, as a vocation to be realized, all the habits and concrete actions of an agent. The human being, who is “rational instinct” in her deepest reality, ought to realize her rational function in the universe. How so? Moreover, Peirce adds that the human teleology is always “in evolution. ” How should we understand this claim? In order to answer these questions, I focus on an early manuscript (R 1116), in which Peirce introduces two important notions, i. e. “Incarnation” and “Carnification. ” These notions show that a final cause (or a “plan” or “function”) can be realized in a “matter” in a multiplicity of degrees: while “Incarnation” means any one of the manifold partial realizations of the final cause in a matter, “Carnification” stands for its full and flawless realization. I believe that Peirce’s later metaphysical claims on “destined habits” develop the germinal and inchoate ideas present in “Incarnation” and “Carnification. ” In the reminder of this third section, I explain that according to Peirce the partial realization of the final cause should be understand as a “vague” realization. In order to do this, I sketch some of Peirce’s distinctions between different forms of indeterminacy (ambiguity VS. generality) and different forms of vagueness (subjective vagueness and objective vagueness). My conclusive thesis is that the final cause is “developmental” insofar as its vague realization asks for a determination. The way in which the human being determines the vague final cause is through an adequate “semeiosis” of the signs of her experience. The first-person viewpoint identifies in particular those signs with propositions, beliefs, interests, desires, and ultimate ideals. How should the individual interpret those signs and produce actions, beliefs and further propositions? In particular, what habits of action are good and what evil? As it is clear, the problem of the determination of the vagueness of the human being’s rational end opens to the problem of normativity. Chapter 2 ’s task is to analyze critically Peirce’s doctrine of the “Normative Sciences,” which include logic, ethics and aesthetics. The chapter is divided in three parts. First, I try to reconstruct what Peirce has truly said|$|R
