5|$|Prior {{to modern}} {{settlement}} in villages, the nomadic indigenous peoples of Ethiopia provided easy hunting <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bushcrow {{as they left}} loose, dung-covered soil behind as they moved their cattle.

5|$|As a {{condition}} of being allowed to disinter the skeleton, the archaeologists agreed that, if Richard were found, his remains would be reburied in Leicester Cathedral. A controversy arose as to whether an alternative reburial site, York Minster or Westminster Abbey, would be more suitable. A legal challenge confirmed there were no public law <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> courts {{to be involved in}} that decision. Reinterment took place in Leicester on 26 March 2015, during a televised memorial service held {{in the presence of the}} Archbishop of Canterbury and senior members of other Christian denominations.|$|E
5|$|The TV rights {{agreement}} between the Premier League and Sky has faced accusations of being a cartel, {{and a number of}} court cases have arisen as a result. An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position. In July 1999 the Premier League's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, who concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.|$|E

5|$|As well as holding Sunderland games, {{the stadium}} has also hosted England matches. The stadium {{was one of}} several venues used as {{temporary}} home <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> England team while the redevelopment of Wembley Stadium took place. It hosted its first England game in 1999, when they played Belgium in a friendly match, which England won 2–1. It played host to its first competitive England match on 2 April 2003, when they played Turkey in a Euro 2004 qualifying match, which England won 2–0. The Stadium of Light also held an England under 20 match against Italy on 27 November 2002, Italy beat England 5–3. On 10 June 2003 it hosted England's under-21's 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 7 match against Slovakia's under-21's.

5|$|The Nevill Ground was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} host <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1983 Cricket World Cup. It hosted one group stage match between India and Zimbabwe on 18June 1983. Kapil Dev scored 175 not out after India were 9–4, which helped India win by 31 runs and qualify into the semi-finals, thus avoiding a play-off against Australia. Dev's partnership with Syed Kirmani set a world record for the largest ninth wicket stand of 126. This match led to the Nevill Ground being held in high regard by Indian cricket fans with there being a view that the game at the Nevill Ground inspired a change in the way cricket was played in India. This led to players such as Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid playing for India in later years.|$|E
5|$|Upon leaving Delaware City, DE 9 {{continues}} west as Wrangle Hill Road, passing between PBF Energy's Delaware City Refinery to {{the north}} and farm fields to the south. The route turns north onto River Road to head into the oil refinery complex, with DE 72 continuing west on Wrangle Hill Road. Within the oil refinery, the road crosses Norfolk Southern's Reybold Running Track railroad line. DE 9 leaves the industrial area upon crossing marshy Red Lion Creek and continues into a mix of fields, woods, and marshland, with DE 9 Truck heading northwest on Hamburg Road. At this point, the route turns {{to the north}}east and passes between Ommelanden Park to the west and the Ommelanden Hunter Training Center to the east before running between residential subdivisions to the west and the northern training <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Delaware National Guard to the east. DE 9 passes through wooded areas with some homes before continuing into industrial areas and crossing a railroad spur. The road continues into marshland immediately to the northwest of the Delaware River before entering New Castle.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{was scheduled}} to take up to 133 days, although the actual filming took 128. Filming began on 7 November 2011 in and around London, with the cinematographer Roger Deakins using Arri Alexa digital cameras to shoot the entire film. Scenes were shot in London Underground stations, Smithfield car park in West Smithfield, the National Gallery, Southwark, Whitehall, Parliament Square, Charing Cross station the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, Cadogan Square and Tower Hill. St Bartholomew's Hospital {{was used as the}} filming location for the scene in which Bond enters MI6's underground headquarters, while the Old Vic Tunnels underneath Waterloo Station in London served as the MI6 training <b>grounds.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> meeting between Q and Bond, production worked during the National Gallery's closing hours at night. The Department of Energy and Climate Change was used in the scene when Bond stood on the roof {{near the end of the}} film. The Vauxhall Bridge and Millbank was closed to traffic for filming the explosion at the MI6 headquarters at Vauxhall Cross. Unlike The World Is Not Enough, which also featured an explosion at the building—which was filmed at a large-scale replica—the explosion in Skyfall was added digitally in post-production. Shooting of the finale was planned to take place at Duntrune Castle in Argyll, but was cancelled shortly after filming began. Glencoe was instead chosen for filming of these scenes. Although supposedly based in Scotland, Bond's family home of Skyfall was constructed on Hankley Common in Surrey using plywood and plaster to build a full-scale model of the building.|$|E
5|$|Whitney {{decides to}} give Lee another chance on the {{condition}} that he will never assault her again, therefore he should seek anger management therapy. Lee gratefully accepts for the sake of their marriage. However, on Valentine's Day, Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a handwritten note on their bed saying he no longer loves her. He returns the following day, apologising to Whitney for his actions and tells her of his plans to move to Dover. An upset Whitney, realising that Lee plans to leave on his own to figure himself out, tells him to leave and she watches him from the window as he drives off. Whitney becomes closer to Mick in Linda's absence and is warned by Shirley to stay away from him. When Mick leaves to look after Nancy when she is hit by a car Whitney is left in charge of running the pub. She later steals Vincent Hubbard's (Richard Blackwood) credit card to pay for a dog pen for Lady Di (Hot Lips), as the Carters cannot afford it due to their debts. Whitney later grows close to new bar manager Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan). Lee attempts to call Whitney but Woody tells Lee that she does not want to speak to him, so Lee sends his friend Moose (Sam Gittins) to see her, who says that Lee wants a divorce. Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> divorce, but Woody tells her it is not a big deal. Whitney declares that she is going to move on with her life and goes out shopping, but Woody sees she has not taken her purse and goes to give it to her. Whitney is caught shoplifting by a security guard, who offers her sex in exchange for not calling the police. Woody arrives and punches the guard, and takes Whitney home. Whitney and Woody kiss and have sex, and then a returning Mick finds them in bed together. Mick finds more items that Whitney has shoplifted, and she says she should never have married Lee as she is damaged and only good for sex but he tells her she is wrong and promises not to leave again. Mick lashes out at Whitney after learning that Linda and Shirley sold the freehold of the Vic without his knowledge to pay for an operation for Lady Di. A few days later, Whitney is depressed and vulnerable and, when Mick kisses her, she responds. When Shirley finds out about the kiss, she orders Whitney to get out, telling her that Mick would never choose her over Linda. Devastated, Whitney leaves Walford.|$|E
