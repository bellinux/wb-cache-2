5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{appointments}} to the Order were largely political, from the 1770s appointments to the Order were increasingly made for naval, military or diplomatic achievements. This is {{partly due to}} the conflicts Britain was engaged in over this period. The Peninsular War resulted in so many deserving candidates for the Bath that a statute was issued allowing the appointment of Extra Knights in time of war, who were to be additional to the numerical limits imposed by the statutes, and whose number was not subject to any restrictions. Another statute, this one issued some 80 years earlier, had also added a military note to the Order. Each knight was required, under certain circumstances, to supply and support four men-at-arms for a period not exceeding 42 days in any year, to serve <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain. This company was to be captained by the Great Master, who had to supply four trumpeters, and was also to appoint eight officers for this body, however the statute was never invoked.|$|E

Moreover, error zones may be sometimes hard to avoid and predict, and they may happen <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> transmission paths. For higher PER, the proposed partially reliable transmission approach will not only avoid increasing energy consumption but also provide energy savings.|$|R

5|$|Lameness in horses is {{movement}} at an abnormal gait due to pain <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the body. It is frequently caused by pain to the shoulders, hips, legs or feet. Lameness {{can also be}} caused by abnormalities in the digestive, circulatory and nervous systems. While horses with poor conformation and congenital conditions {{are more likely to}} develop lameness, trauma, infection and acquired abnormalities are also causes. The largest cause of poor performance in equine athletes is lameness caused by abnormalities in the muscular or skeletal systems. The majority of lameness is found in the forelimbs, with at least 95 percent of these cases stemming from problems in the structures from the knee down. Lameness in the hind limbs is caused by problems in the hock and/or stifle 80 percent of the time.|$|E

The feature was introduced when WWF SmackDown! was released in 2000. As new games were released, the mode was altered; the first change came with the release of WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role, which featured a mode in which wrestler taunts could be created and customized. This was further modified in WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth, which enabled players to create the walking style of a wrestler. With the release of WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006, the game first featured the ability for players to make an entrance for the created superstar. The feature was expanded with the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007, as players could place pyrotechnics and special effects <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the superstar's entrance.|$|E

5|$|These {{fundamental}} rights help {{not only in}} protection but also the prevention of gross violations of human rights. They emphasise on the fundamental unity of India by guaranteeing to all citizens the access {{and use of the}} same facilities, irrespective of background. Some {{fundamental rights}} apply for persons of any nationality whereas others are available only to the citizens of India. The right to life and personal liberty is available to all people and so is the right to freedom of religion. On the other hand, freedoms of speech and expression and freedom to reside and settle <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the country are reserved to citizens alone, including non-resident Indian citizens. The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to overseas citizens of India.|$|E
5|$|This amendment, {{as well as}} the Fourteenth, is {{undoubtedly}} self-executing, without any ancillary legislation, so far as its terms are applicable to any existing state of circumstances. By its own unaided force and effect, it abolished slavery and established universal freedom. Still, legislation may be necessary and proper to meet all the various cases and circumstances to be affected by it, and to prescribe proper modes of redress for its violation in letter or spirit. And such legislation may be primary and direct in its character, for the amendment is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Freedom {{is covered}} in Articles 19-22, with the view of guaranteeing {{individual}} rights that were considered vital by {{the framers of the}} Constitution, and these Articles also include certain restrictions that may be imposed by the State on individual liberty under specified conditions. Article 19 guarantees six freedoms in the nature of civil rights, which are available only to citizens of India. These include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly without arms, freedom of association, freedom of movement throughout the territory of our country, freedom to reside and settle <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the country of India and the freedom to practice any profession. All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may imposed on them by the State, listed under Article 19 itself. The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted, and include national security, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, incitement to offences, and defamation. The State is also empowered, {{in the interests of the}} general public to nationalise any trade, industry or service to the exclusion of the citizens.|$|E
