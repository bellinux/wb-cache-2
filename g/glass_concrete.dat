The College of Physicians and Surgeons {{played a central role}} in {{developing}} the modern understanding of neuroscience with the publication of Principles of Neural Science, described by historian of science Katja Huenther as the [...] "neuroscience 'bible'". The book was written by a team of Columbia researchers that included Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, James H. Schwartz, and Thomas Jessell. Columbia was the birthplace of FM radio and the laser. The MPEG-2 algorithm of transmitting high quality audio and video over limited bandwidth was developed by Dimitris Anastassiou, a Columbia professor of electrical engineering. Biologist Martin Chalfie {{was the first}} to introduce the use of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in labeling cells in intact organisms. Other inventions and products related to Columbia include Sequential Lateral Solidification (SLS) technology for making LCDs, System Management Arts (SMARTS), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (which is used for audio, video, chat, instant messaging and whiteboarding), pharmacopeia, Macromodel (software for computational chemistry), a new and better recipe for <b>glass</b> <b>concrete,</b> Blue LEDs, and Beamprop (used in photonics).|$|E

500|$|In {{defining}} {{his method}} for creating Tron: Legacy, Kosinski declared that his main {{objective was to}} [...] "make it feel real", adding that he wanted the audience to feel like filming actually occurred in the fictional universe. For this, many physical sets were built, as Kosinski [...] "wanted the materials to be real materials: <b>glass,</b> <b>concrete,</b> steel, so it {{had this kind of}} visceral quality." [...] Kosinski collaborated with people who specialized in fields outside of the film industry, such as architecture and automotive design. The looks for the Grid aimed for a more advanced version of the cyberspace visited by Flynn in Tron, which Lisberger described as [...] "a virtual Galapagos, which has evolved on its own". As Bailey put, the Grid would not have any influence from the internet as it had turned offline from the real world in the 1980s, and [...] "grew on its own server into something powerful and unique". Kosinski added that as the simulation became more realistic, it would try to become closer to the real world with environmental effects such as rain and wind, and production designer Darren Gilford stated {{that there would be a}} juxtaposition between the variety of texture and color of the real world introduction in contrast with the [...] "clean surfaces and lines" [...] of the Grid. As the design team considered the lights a major part of the Tron look, particularly for being set in a dark world—described by effects art director Ben Procter as [...] "dark silhouetted objects dipped in an atmosphere with clouds in-between, in a kind of Japanese landscape painting" [...] where [...] "the self-lighting of the objects is the main light source"—lighting was spread through every prop on the set, including the floor in Flynn's hideout. Lisberger also stated that while the original Tron [...] "reflected the way cyberspace was", the sequel was [...] "going to be like a modern day, like contemporary plus, in terms of how much resolution, the texturing, the feel, the style", adding that [...] "it doesn’t have that Pong Land vibe to it anymore." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: This {{research}} study presented the durability performance of <b>glass</b> fibre reinforced <b>concrete.</b> Approach: The influence of fiber content on the durability performance of <b>glass</b> fibre reinforced <b>concrete</b> specimens having different percentage of glass fibres with varying grades of concrete were investigated. Results: The parameter of investigation included rapid chloride permeability test {{for a period}} of 365 days. Specimens of 100 × 150 mm cylinders were cast and tested to study their parameters. The specimens incorporated with addition of 0. 03, 0. 06 and 0. 10 % of glass fibres in M 30, M 40 and M 50 grades of concrete. The durability performances of <b>glass</b> fibre reinforced <b>concrete</b> were compared with that of plain concrete. Conclusion/Recommendations: The results show that addition of glass fibres improves that durability performance appreciably.

50|$|Jolly had a {{particular}} interest in organic architecture. He was influenced heavily by Frank Lloyd Wright’s work in America, especially the way Wright used the outside environment {{to play a role}} in the building. Jolly’s work contrasted with the stark modernism of the time, by focussing on the appreciation of organic forms and materials. Jolly studied the landscape and the shapes inspired by nature, such as timber, stone, wrought iron and brick, and was opposed to the <b>glass,</b> <b>concrete</b> and steel that were popular at the time. Organic inspiration saw the beginning of the Arts and Crafts movement and the California Bungalow.|$|E
