40|$|In {{recent years}} due to {{technological}} advances, innovative curriculum design has {{been central to}} the developments within many health care education programmes. The Medical Ultrasound programme at City University London has been no exception. To enhance the face to face learning time within the part-time postgraduate programme a method of blended learning was developed, which involves on-line lectures and <b>guided</b> <b>self-study,</b> supported by interactive film viewing sessions, group discussions, simulation and games within the lectures. Additionally on-line case discussions are used to share clinical cases from the students’ workplace and develop collaborative M-level learning and assessment in the clinical modules. To further engage students with this collaborative learning and help to develop transferable skills, students negotiate their own “rules” and take responsibility for leading the cases. The term “flipped classroom” has appeared frequently in recent educational literature.

40|$|AbstractMost B. Com degrees, {{recognising}} {{the fundamental}} role {{of information and}} communication technology (ICT) in business and society, require students to take an introductory course in Information Systems (IS). Most IS courses offered to first year B. Com students are simply introductory courses originally designed for intended IS majors. These provide a broad, but arguably superficial introduction to the various elements of ICT, failing to situate technology within the modern business world or everyday life of the average B. Com student. Students inevitably treat the course simply as a requirement for graduation, and take little of value with them either into their university or working life. Taking accessibility of content, relevance and real world application as a departure point, an introductory IS course was radically redesigned, moving away from chapter-based textbook coverage. Instead, an integrated theme-based approach guiding students from engaged reflection on personal information systems towards {{an understanding of the}} impact of ICT in business and society has been developed. With typical enrolment ranging between 550 and 750 students, a learning management system with forum participation and online quizzes, small group tutorials, <b>guided</b> <b>self-study</b> tasks and informal social networking was central to the redesign. This paper examines the motivation and rationale behind the course redesign. Preliminary data analysis of course evaluations, lecturer interviews and focus groups from the first action research cycle is presented. Early results and anecdotal evidence suggest higher levels of student participation, deeper engagement with concepts and content, and increased interest in IS as a major...|$|E

(Media Science) Aim of the study: To {{explore the}} theories, principles, new models and {{strategies}} {{of teaching and}} learning in order to provide an alternative to the traditional way {{of teaching and learning}}. To develop a multimedia programme in which individual learning is enhanced, using a <b>Guided</b> <b>Self-study</b> programme, being a combination of the Keller Plan and the Postlethwait system. 1. 4 Method of investigation An exploration of literature as regards the use of particular media in individual learning. Studying media that will be used in drawing up an alternative programme in individual learning, utilizing a picture, a tape and study guide, bearing the models of learning in Chapter 2 in mind. 1. 5 Structure of the study In the first chapter literature will be reviewed to gain an overview of the situation in Black education. Probable causes of the high failure rate in English will be examined through reports by examiners of English Second Language Higher Grade (1990 a) and Motau (1990). Standard 7, 8 and 9 results will be studied to recognize the trend in performance especially in English literature, as this will be used in developing individualized programmes later in this study (see Appendix A and B). Bearing this knowledge in mind, the principles of learning by Mursell (1954) and Romiszowski's new model of learning will be examined {{in the light of the}} aims of teaching English, which emphasize the acquisition of certain skills and the use of the senses in teaching and learning (Compare paragraph 1. 2. 3). Romiszowski's model revives this awareness. Various learner-centred approaches will be highlighted in the second chapter (compare paragraph 2. 5). The third chapter will concentrate on media. It should, however, be observed that media which have been thoroughly dealt with by other researchers in other studies will merely be alluded to. The author of this study acknowledges the views of previous researchers and would like to use only media that are affordable, and can easily be manipulated and duplicated. The fourth chapter will focus on a synthesis of the script and recommendations for further research. In Appendix A a multimedia programme for standard 9 is described. Appendix B contains a proposal for a multimedia programme for teaching English literature to standard 10. An attempt will be made to include Pottas's steps in drawing up a study guide, Romiszowski's new model (compare paragraph 1. 3. 5) and also skills, hierarchical frameworks and feedback models (compare paragraph 2. 3). In this study the emphasis will be on individual learning. It will be endeavoured to use media and approaches by which individual learning is enhanced and which will motivate the learner to study independently...|$|E

Students who choose this project are to choose a mentor and a class with which to assist. For this project, I, Katherine Ferri, chose to assist with Dr. Felts' Health 3010 class. I had taken this class {{a little over a year}} prior to the start of the project. The goal of the project was to learn new and different methods of teaching students information for the course. The first semester of the project mainly consisted of observing Dr. Felts' teaching style and methods, as well as creating an average of three extra credit quizzes per week. The extra credit quizzes covered material that was covered in class that day as well as material from assigned readings and Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports.
