40|$|We {{consider}} an asset allocation problem of three asset classes: bond, equities and derivatives. The {{problem is to}} maximize the expected utility of the terminal wealth with the investor's preference described by an exponential utility function. The equity class consists of multiple stocks and the <b>derivative</b> <b>class</b> consists of European options with all possible strikes written on each stock. This problem, under a single-period is solved under the assumptions that the stock price processes follow Geometric Brownian motions with a budget constraint. Optimal payoff at the terminal date for the investor is also obtained and the corresponding replications of the asset positions for the derived payoff are explicitly worked out. Performances and usefulness of the obtained optimal strategies are illustrated through numerical examples, where the stock price movements are generated by Monte Carlo simulations. In testing {{the performance of the}} optimal strategies, a well-known portfolio performance measure, Sharpe ratio, is used and the portfolio created by the mean-variance method is also used as a benchmark. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we aim to}} show {{effects of}} {{centrally}} clearing OTC derivatives on counterparty exposures. Central clearing {{is the process of}} replacing bilateral exposures from transactions with a network of multilateral exposures. In all transactions, a central counterparty (CCP) is the intermediary, acting as a buyer to each seller and vice versa. Central clearing has been mandated by regulators to mitigate counterparty credit risk which was {{a major factor in the}} 2008 / 09 financial crisis. We emphasize credit default swaps which are a financial instrument that compensates in the case of a credit event and follow the model by Duffie and Zhu (2011) as well as part of the model extension by Cont and Kokholm (2014). Their research is related to clearing effciency when clearing a single <b>derivative</b> <b>class.</b> We show how netting efficiency is measured and that splitting counterparty clearing over several clearing facilities can have adverse effects to the intended purpose of the clearing system in some settings.

40|$|The credit {{derivatives}} {{market has been}} growing rapidly over the past years. Credit risk, like market risk or interest risk, {{is part of the}} risk family in the financial industry. A number of {{credit derivatives}} have been developed to protect investors against credit risk. As more and more participants appeared, the market calls for more quantitative ways to measure risks, and eventually to price credit derivatives more properly. The credit <b>derivative</b> <b>class</b> can be divided into two basic categories according to the number of credit risk products being protected, single-name and multi-name credit derivatives. The product is from only one issuer for the single-name credit derivatives, while there would be several issuers for products in multi-name derivatives. This paper focuses on the copula approach to the pricing of multi-name credit derivative baskets. A copula function is basically a multi-dimensional distribution function with uniform marginal distributions. It explains the connections between the marginals from a more fundamental level. Unlike the traditional use of linear correlation, a copula function is able to separate the specific marginal distributions from the underlying dependence structure of the random vector. Thus with the same linear correlation, there can exist...|$|E
40|$|Structure-toxicity {{relationships}} for {{a series}} of 75 azo and azo-anilide dyes and five diazonium salts were developed using Hydractinia echinata (H. echinata) as model species. In addition, based on these relationships, predictions for 58 other azo-dyes were made. The experimental results showed that the measured effectiveness Mlog(1 /MRC 50) does not depend on the number of azo groups or the ones corresponding to metobolites, but it is influenced by the number of anilide groups, {{as well as by the}} substituents’ positions within molecules. The conformational analysis pointed out the intramolecular hydrogen bonds, especially the simple tautomerization of quinoidic (STOH) or aminoidic (STNH 2) type. The effectiveness is strongly influenced by the “push-pull” electronic effect, specific to two hydroxy or amino groups separated by an azo moiety (double alternate tautomery, (DAT), to the –COOH or –SO 3 H groups which are located in ortho or para position with respect to the azo group. The levels of the lipophylic/hydrophilic, electronic and steric equilibriums, pointed out by the Mlog(1 /MRC 50) values, enabled the calculation of their average values Clog(1 /MRC 50) (“Köln model”), characteristic to one <b>derivative</b> <b>class</b> (class isotoxicity). The azo group reduction and the hydrolysis of the amido/peptidic group are two concurrent enzymatic reactions, which occur with different reaction rates and mechanisms.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} monepantel, a developmental compound from the amino-acetonitrile <b>derivative</b> <b>class</b> of anthelmintics, against field infections of gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep. Procedures: Comparisons of efficacy (using standard faecal worm egg count reduction tests) and safety (on the basis of visual observations) were made in a large-scale field study in Australia, between groups of sheep treated with either an oral solution of monepantel or a registered anthelmintic. The sheep were naturally infected with the major gastrointestinal nematode genera present in Australia. Results: The post-treatment efficacy results for monepantel were: at 7 days (± 1 day) efficacy was > 98 %; at 14 days (± 1 day) it was generally close to or > 99 %; and at 21 days (± 1 day) efficacy was consistently > 99 %. A high proportion of the targeted nematode populations were confirmed as being resistant {{to one or more}} of the currently available anthelmintic classes. Conclusions: Monepantel when used under field conditions at a minimum dose rate of 2. 5 mg/kg was highly effective against mixed-genus natural field infections of the major gastrointestinal nematode genera including Haemonchus, Teladorsagia (Ostertagia), Trichostrongylus, Nematodirus, Chabertia and Oesophagostomum. This result included efficacy against some populations resistant to the currently available broad-spectrum anthelmintics. Few Cooperia spp. were present to allow confirmation of efficacy against this genus. On no occasion after treatment did any commercial anthelmintic-treated groups have significantly lower faecal egg counts than the monepantel-treated groups. Monepantel was safe for the target animals and human operators when used in a field situation.
