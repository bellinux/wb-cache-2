2500|$|In {{places such}} as Kerala where {{coconuts}} are in abundance, the <b>half</b> <b>shell</b> of coconut {{was used as the}} latex collection container. Glazed pottery or aluminium or plastic cups became [...] more common in Kerala and other countries. The cups are supported by a wire that encircles the tree. This wire incorporates a spring so it can stretch as the tree grows. The latex is led into the cup by a galvanised [...] "spout" [...] knocked into the bark. Tapping normally takes place early in the morning, when the internal pressure of the tree is highest. A good tapper can tap a tree every 20 seconds on a standard half-spiral system, and a common daily [...] "task" [...] size is between 450 and 650 trees. Trees are usually tapped on alternate or third days, although many variations in timing, length and number of cuts are used. [...] "Tappers would make a slash in the bark with a small hatchet. These slanting cuts allowed latex to flow from ducts located on the exterior or the inner layer of bark (cambium) of the tree. Since the cambium controls the growth of the tree, growth stops if it is cut. Thus, rubber tapping demanded accuracy, so that the incisions would not be too many given the size of the tree, or too deep, which could stunt its growth or kill it." ...|$|E

25|$|Historian Allan Nevins, for instance, {{writes of}} {{political}} rallies in 1856 with turnouts of anywhere from twenty to fifty thousand men and women.

By 1858, they were mostly gone, and politics divided four ways. Republicans controlled most Northern states with a strong Democratic minority. The Democrats were split North and South and fielded two tickets in 1860. Southern non-Democrats tried different coalitions; most supported the Constitutional Union party in 1860.|$|R
