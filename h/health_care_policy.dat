25|$|One {{reason the}} high cost of health care yields disappointing results is because only 0.05 percent of health care dollars are spent on {{assessing}} how well new health care technology works.

40|$|This article {{offers a}} micro-macro-economic {{approach}} {{for the long}} term analysis of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> sector and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>policies.</b> The medical supply behavior is built using a «working-time allocation choice» between various qualities of care; this choice is connected to a decomposition of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in two activities: one effective and another non-effective («induced demand»). A technical progress is also introduced in the model, taking into account the specificity of medical progress («extension of range»). These micro-economic foundations of health supply are then integrated in a model of growth with capital accumulation and overlapped generations (Solow-Diamond type). The conclusions concern the evolution of health expenditures, the population? welfare and capital accumulation, with respect to different <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>policies.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The rise of {{consumerism}} and {{the increasing}} availability of information through the Internet have increased patients’ demand for care that is {{more in line with}} their preferences. Because of this trend the expectation that hospitals act according to each individual patient’s preferences is becoming even more prominent. Hospitals could respond by implementing flexible <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>policies</b> that offer patients more choice. In this dissertation we explore two types of flexible <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>policies</b> from the consumer perspective: priority access pricing and customized care. We do this by (1) investigating how consumers evaluate price-based priority access allocation policies (i. e., allocation policies in which patients are offered the option to pay extra for faster <b>health</b> <b>care</b> access), and by (2) demonstrating how the collective costs and benefits of customized <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>policies</b> (i. e., policies that offer individuals the possibility to “create” their own <b>health</b> <b>care</b> program) can be used to evaluate customized care. Throughout, special attention is given to the role of collective health outcomes. Besides our scientific conclusions, our findings are also relevant for hospitals and policy makers that consider implementing new allocation policies. They can be used to provide assistance in future <b>health</b> <b>care</b> decision making...|$|R

40|$|<b>Health</b> <b>care</b> {{financing}} and funding are usually analyzed in isolation. This paper combines the corresponding strands {{of the literature}} and thereby advances {{our understanding of the}} important interaction between them. We investigate the impact of three modes of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> financing, namely, optimal income taxation, proportional income taxation, and insurance premiums, on optimal provider payment and on the political implementability of optimal policies under majority voting. Considering a standard multi-task agency framework we show that optimal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>policies</b> will generally differ across financing regimes when the health authority has redistributive concerns. We show that <b>health</b> <b>care</b> financing also has a bearing on the political implementability of optimal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>policies.</b> Our results demonstrate that an isolated analysis of (optimal) provider payment rests on very strong assumptions regarding both the financing of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and the redistributive preferences of the health authority...|$|R

25|$|The Deferre Law {{reduced the}} powers of the prefect, set up elected {{regional}} councils, and increased {{the powers of}} local government. The security court was abolished, and measures were introduced to control police harassment. Legal aid was extended, legislation was introduced which effectively combated discrimination against homosexuals, and the traditional powers of the juge d’instruction in the preparation of criminal cases was reduced. The Quillot Law of 1982 provided renters with additional rights in housing matters, while an audiovisual law passed that same year brought an end to the state monopoly of audiovisual broadcasting and established a High Authority to guarantee the independence of public television channels. Laws were passed in 1982 to reform higher education to make the academy more responsive {{to the needs of the}} state. High security wings in prisons were abolished, while social security reform increased workers’ representation on the bodies that oversaw the management of the social security schemes. In order to make the elite political academy (the ENA) accessible to a wider section of the population, a special entry pathway was established for those who had held trade union or political office. A new <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>policy</b> was implemented, which included the abolition of private beds in hospitals, reform of medical training, modernisation of facilities, and the election of the heads of medical services by the entire staff, rather than just by doctors, as had previously been the case.
