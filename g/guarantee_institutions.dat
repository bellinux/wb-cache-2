50|$|The FSS {{also took}} a series of {{measures}} to strengthen the lines of support to {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) in times of liquidity shortage during the global financial crisis. Working jointly with the Korea Federation of Banks and other organizations, the FSS introduced the SME Fast Track program in October 2008, injecting a combined liquidity of 2.82 trillion won to 1,672 SMEs by the end of 2008. By coordinating policies with the FSC and other relevant agencies, and enlisting the active cooperation of the financial sector, the FSS helped to increase the guarantee amount from <b>guarantee</b> <b>institutions</b> and to extend the maturity of SME loans. Thanks to the combination of SME support measures, SME loans increased by 52.4 trillion won in 2008 - despite the bleak economic circumstances of the global financial crisis - which is comparable with the average increase of 56.7 trillion won in 2006 and 2007.|$|E

The development of various types of credit <b>guarantee</b> <b>institutions</b> has become an important means to solve the financing difficulty.

The reason for their usefulness lies not only in their ability to assist enterprises in situations of crisis, but also in the higher degree of efficiency achieved by their specific function, bridging the gap between enterprises and credit institutions in the credit-granting process.

Hence, MGI willingness to post collateral signals firms credit-worthiness to banks. Our estimates indicate that indeed MGI affiliation improves small firms lending. ...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{economic}} and financial crisis has drawn attention to how mutual <b>guarantee</b> <b>institutions</b> (MGIs) facilitate small and medium enterprises in accessing bank financing. The aim {{of this paper is}} twofold. First, we describe the structural features of the Italian market for mutual guarantees and its significance for small business credit. To this end, we use extensive databases (the Central Credit Register and the Central Balance Sheet Register) as well as specific surveys, which allow us to fill information gaps about this industry and to quantify regional diversity. Second, we investigate whether MGIs’ support to small firms continued to be effective in 2008 - 09, when credit constraints to Italian firms peaked. We find that MGIs played a role in avoiding a break-up in credit flows to affiliated firms, which also benefited from a lower cost of credit. However, this came at the cost of a deterioration in credit quality, which was more intense for customers with guarantees from MGIs. microfinance, peer monitoring, small business finance...|$|E
40|$|In a {{financial}} system, in which SMEs have no substantial alternatives to bank lending, credit <b>guarantee</b> <b>institutions</b> (CGIs) can significantly contribute to facilitating the credit access of such firms, {{by reducing the}} information asymmetries between the lenders and the borrowers and, in some cases, by decreasing the cost of funding. Financial crises and the new capital requirements are leading to increased interest from both practitioners and regulators for these financial institutions, which have always acted as intermediaries between banks and enterprises. These changes in market and regulatory conditions have made it necessary to assess whether {{the new generation of}} CGIs is really able to support credit access and whether they can be considered a valid instrument for avoiding small lending problems. That’s why, over the last twenty years, the literature has paid more attention to measuring their financial additionality or incrementality, the economic additionality and financial sustainability of the CGIs, and the practioners have paid more attention to measuring their creditworthiness, their risk and their performance profile. The validity and the "strength" of the support provided by CGI's to those who have difficulties in accessing credit, in fact, in the current competitive environment, are closely related to the solvency and solidity of CGI's. Nevertheless, these last two "dimensions" qualify and determine the ability of CGI's to survive in the current economic situation. It has therefore become crucial for a variety of the CGI's interlocutors, who interface with them in different roles (policy makers, intermediary banks, industry associations), to understand their risk and performance profile; to attempt to measure the credit, even in a rudimentary way. In this perspective, this paper aims to define a quantitative scoring framework methodology able to expresses the risk and performance of a sample of Italian CGIs (so called Confidi) on an experimental position map. The construction of the ranking/position map {{on the basis of the}} CGIs’ score is derived from a set of indices expressive of the balance of management and more representative of the production process of CGIs and their risk profile and performance. The present work is a first experimental exercise in the field of credit <b>guarantee</b> <b>institutions</b> ranking/scoring therefore it is subject to improvements and possible future developments highlighted in the concluding remarks...|$|E
40|$|A {{large body}} of {{literature}} has shown that small firms experience difficulties in accessing the credit market due to informational asymmetries. Banks can overcome these asymmetries through relationship lending, or at least mitigate their effects by asking for collateral. Small firms, {{especially if they are}} young, have little collateral and short credit histories, and thus may find it difficult to raise funds from banks. In this paper, we show that even in this case, small firms may improve their borrowing capacity by joining Mutual <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Institutions</b> (MGI). Our empirical analysis shows that small firms affiliated to MGIs pay less for credit compared with similar firms. We obtain this result for interest rates charged on loan contracts which are not backed by mutual guarantees. We then argue that our findings are consistent with the view that MGIs are better at screening and monitoring opaque borrowers than banks are. Thus, banks benefit from the willingness of MGIs to post collateral since this implies that firms are better screened and monitored.

30|$|In {{developed}} countries, {{mutual guarantee}} associations or government-backed public <b>institutions</b> <b>guarantee</b> {{part of the}} banks' loans to entrepreneurs (De Gobbi 2003). This reassures the bank because often entrepreneurs are able to pay back {{a large part of}} the loan, even if they are not successful in total reimbursement. The European Association of Mutual Guarantee Societies has 34 members providing guarantees for 1.9 million small and medium enterprises (Source aecm.org 2009 statistics). This is the case for example in France of the social cohesion fund, established by the Planning Act for Social Cohesion on 18 January 2005 (Lecomte 2008). The fund has over 5 years of 73 million euros. It brings guarantee for microenterprises created by disadvantaged populations or individuals who are victims of banking exclusion. However, although such <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>institutions</b> are cropping up in developing countries, they do not have the required outreach among the poor.|$|R

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{literature}} has shown that small firms, due to their opaqueness, may {{find it difficult to}} access the credit market. Informational asymmetries may be mitigated by posting collateral or by building relationships with lenders (relationship lending). However, in some cases, {{due to a lack of}} collateral or of a long credit history, small enterprises may still find it very difficult to raise external finance unless alternative contracting schemes emerge. In particular, group lending or similarly micro-finance are examples of such alternative lending contracts. In this paper, we investigate the effect of mutual <b>guarantee</b> <b>institutions</b> (MGI) on loan interest rates. We argue that, similarly to group lending and micro-finance, firms affiliated to a MGI are linked by a joint responsibility for the loan providing MGI affiliates with peer monitoring incentives. Indeed, each MGI member contributes to the guarantee fund that is then posted as collateral to loans granted to MGI members. As a consequence, MGI willingness to post collateral signals firms creditworthiness to banks. The econometric analysis supports the hypothesis that these consortia improve lending conditions for small firms. ...|$|E
30|$|The main {{financing}} channel of high-tech SMEs is debt financing, such as bank credit, issuing bonds, commercial papers, etc. In order to enhance technology and finances, the Guangdong provincial government and financial institutions built a collaboration platform combining technology and finances, {{and established a}} special fund to alleviate the shortage of high-tech industries funds. The local government continued to promote technology and finance in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Dongguan, Zhuhai, Foshan, etc., {{in an attempt to}} expand and strengthen the level of technology and financial services. Guangdong’s credit system and guarantee system were not complete, thus, information asymmetry led to low efficiency of resource allocation, and did not established a well-functioning or flexible technology and financial services platform. Financing <b>guarantee</b> <b>institutions</b> for high-tech enterprises and professional assessment organizations of technological achievements are immature, and the existence of these problems limited the provincial development of technology and finances. While Guangdong high-tech SMEs rely mainly on bank loans, the proportion of bank loans is no more than 5 %, which may be attributed to inadequate technology and the financial services platform.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} role played by Mutual <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Institutions</b> (MGIs) in the lending {{policies}} undertaken by banks {{at the peak of the}} Great Crisis of 2007 - 2009. We address this issue by using a large database on Italian firms built from the credit files of UniCredit banking Group and focusing on small business. We provide an empirical analysis of the determinants of the probability that a borrowing firm will suffer financial tension and obtain two main innovative findings. First, we show that small firms supported by MGIs were less likely to experience financial tensions even at that time of utmost financial stress. Second, our empirical evidence shows that MGIs have played a signalling role beyond the simple provision of a collateral. This latter finding suggests that the information provided by MGIs turned out to be key for bank-firm relations as scoring and rating systems - being typically based on pro-cyclical indicators - had become less informative during the crisis. financial crisis, bank-firm relationships, asymmetric information, credit guarantee schemes, small business finance, peer monitoring...|$|E

In spite of their having recent history, Spanish SGRs represent today an interesting interpretation of the mutualistic guarantee institution model, combining the interest of policy makers, SMEs and banks.
