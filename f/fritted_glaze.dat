30|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} plasmas (APPs) {{system does}} not require vacuum systems and are a cost-effective and convenient alternative to low-pressure plasma systems [3]. APPs have the attractive feature of a non-equilibrium property by which hot electrons, cold neutral gas and ions can co-exist in the plasma state [14]. The energetic electrons lead to enhanced generation of reactive radicals and ions through collisions with the background neutral gas, while the gas temperature remains near the room temperature. As a result, APPs do not cause thermal damage to heat-sensitive biological systems such as cells and living tissue [9]. Plasma generators produce ultraviolet photons, charged particles and chemically active species. Dependent upon the working gases, the following species could be produced: negative and neutral atomic oxygen, ozone, singlet oxygen, superoxide, hydroxyl ions, and NOx compounds. This led to the plasma sterilization technique {{being used as a}} simple, fast and toxic-free residue in the study of disinfection. Limitations in conventional sterilization methods have motivated the search for novel sterilization methods.

PTFE is extensively utilized in synthetic vascular surgery and medical devices because of its chemical and mechanical stability, but it is limited {{due to lack of}} haemocompatibility. APPJ is a suitable choice as it could improve cellular interaction property and tailor the biological response to the implant. Sorrentino and Carrino demonstrated that an oxygen cold plasma treatment could improve wettability and adhesion of Al 2024 surface which is an important alloy at aeronautical application. It should be painted to prevent corrosion which is caused by aeronautical critical environmental condition. They also investigated the influence of different parameters of plasma on the durability of paint on its surface [4]. The plasma processing results in physical and chemical modification in scale of several nanometres (first few molecular layers) while maintaining the properties of the bulk unchanged [3]. There are many investigations, in which plasma was utilized to improve surface properties of materials such as polymers, textiles and etc. Their physical and chemical properties after plasma treatment were examined in detail as well. But there are a few studies investigated the effect of plasma on the properties of non-carbonic base surfaces and needs more investigations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The aim {{of this paper is to}} utilize atmospheric pressure helium plasma jet on Raw and <b>Frit</b> <b>glaze</b> surfaces to improve their paintability and explore the effect of the plasma on their surface properties which seems not fully understood so far. Helium, in comparison with other gases, could be considered the most convenient gas working at atmospheric pressure, as it allows stabilizing homogeneous glow discharges at lower sustaining voltages and inter-electrode gaps. It is also very suitable for surface treatment because of low degradation effect and high properties of cross linking and functionalizing on to the surface [8, 10]. We used helium plasma as it is capable of maintaining simultaneous stability and reactivity, while in other inert gases chemical reactivity is obtained by adding a small amount of reactive gases at the expense of stability and increasing the temperature which may cause non-uniform processing.|$|R

This knowledge can be used to break new ground in frit applications and to obtain products with high added value, such as bioactive glasses. Bioactive glasses are amorphous materials that are able to interact with bone cells, thanks to surface growth of a hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA) layer when they enter into contact with a biological fluid. This bioactivity, together with their relatively low cost compared to that of the materials used at present, makes such materials particularly attractive for obtaining prosthesis and implant coatings. Among the numerous coating methods, atmospheric plasma spraying is one of the most widely used techniques for industrial-scale deposition of this type of coating owing to its versatility, simplicity, and relatively low cost. This study presents a methodology for obtaining bioactive glass coatings by thermal plasma spraying. The methodology includes: frit synthesis; design, preparation and characterisation of appropriate powders and bioactive glass suspensions for thermal plasma spraying; optimisation of the deposition conditions for the obtainment of coatings from powders as well as from suspensions; and characterisation of the end coatings. It was verified that, after deposition, the resulting coatings exhibited the typical microstructure of layers deposited by thermal plasma spraying. In this case, as feedstock of a glassy nature was involved, the microstructure consisted of a matrix of flattened drops of molten glass, together with rounded pores and cracks. The results obtained also indicated that the amorphous nature of the jetted frit was maintained in the end coating, as was intended. However, low adhesion to the substrate was also observed, it being necessary to use a bonding layer between the substrate and the bioactive glass layer. Consequently, further investigation is needed to improve the bond strength and other properties of these coatings, as well as to evaluate their bioactivity.

40|$|The European {{ceramic tile}} {{industry}} is mostly concentrated in two clusters, one in Castelló (Spain) {{and another one}} in Modena (Italy). Industrial clusters may have problems to accomplish the EU air quality regulations because of the concentration of some specific pollutants and, hence, the feasibility of the industrial clusters can be jeopardised. The present work assesses the air quality in these ceramic clusters in 2008, when the new EU emission regulations where put into force. PM 10 samples were collected at two sampling sites in the Modena ceramic cluster and one sampling site in the Castelló ceramic cluster. PM 10 annual average concentrations were 12 – 14 μg m− 3 higher in Modena than in Castelló, and were close to or exceeded the European limit. Air quality in Modena was mainly influenced by road traffic and, in a lower degree, the metalmechanical industry, {{as evidenced by the}} high concentrations of Mn, Cu, Zn, Sn and Sb registered. The stagnant weather conditions from Modena hindering dispersion of pollutants also contributed to the relatively high pollution levels. In Castelló, the influence of the ceramic industry is evidenced by the high concentrations of Ti, Se, Tl and Pb, whereas this influence is not seen in Modena. The difference in the impact of the ceramic industry on the air quality in the two areas was attributed to: better abatement systems in the spray-drier facilities in Modena, higher coverage of the areas for storage and handling of dusty raw materials in Modena, presence of two open air quarries in the Castelló region, low degree of abatement systems in the ceramic tile kilns in Castelló, and abundance of ceramic <b>frit,</b> <b>glaze</b> and pigment manufacture in Castelló as opposed to scarce manufacture of these products in Modena.

The behaviours of the thermal conductivity, thermal shock resistance and important mechanical properties such as modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity of each formulated body were studied. The results revealed that thermal conductivity increased with increasing quartz content of the body. Modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity were decreased with increasing quartz content of the body. Initially to preserve the red colour appearance of the product, it was decided to use a transparent glaze and three transparent glazes were investigated.

The façade was custom designed and supplied by Overgaard Ltd., Hong Kong to Architectural Wall Systems of West Des Moines, Iowa, a speciality glazing contractor. The scope of materials for this one-of-a-kind façade includes approx. 5900 m² of custom insulated <b>fritted</b> glass. This <b>glazing</b> type and pattern has never before been used and was specially developed for the project by both Architectural Wall Systems and Overgaard Ltd. To meet the extreme environmental conditions the insulated glass units are 24 mm thick. The outside sheet is tempered 6 mm low-iron sheer with a silver mirror frit. The inside sheet is 6 mm low-iron clear sheet. The frit is silver reflective {{on one side and}} metallic on the other. All glass units were pre-assembled prior to shipping to allow for easy installation.|$|R

Results indicate that crystallisation is predominantly controlled by a surface nucleation mechanism, even though a partial bulk nucleation has been encountered in compositions containing more than 2 mol% of doping oxide. As detected from differential thermal analysis curves, glass transition temperature and crystallisation temperature, are strongly dependent upon V 2 O 5 content varying from 0. 0 to 2. 0 mol%, while the crystallisation activation energy values decrease with a parabolic trend from B-glass (0. 0 mol% V 2 O 5 content, 495 +/- 7) to V- 0. 7 (0. 7 mol% V 2 O 5 content, 420 +/- 6) composition, increasing again to 442 +/- 5 kJ/mol K with higher amount of V 2 O 5. The microstructure of the glass-ceramic materials clearly showed a marked dependence upon the amount of V 2 O 5, also due {{to the presence of}} phase separation for content higher than 0. 7 mol%. Wollastonite, CaO. SiO 2 and a calcia-zirconia-silicate, 2 CaO. 4 SiO(2). ZrO 2, are the main crystalline phases whose ratio slightly varies with vanadium oxide content. The glass ceramics obtained from the studied materials are greenish and bluish coloured, so it is possible to use the studied glasses as coloured <b>frits</b> for tile <b>glazes.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.

5000|$|The term is {{therefore}} unsatisfactory in several respects, although clear in an Ancient Egyptian context, and is increasingly rejected in museum and archaeological usage. The British Museum now calls this material [...] "glazed composition", {{with the following}} note in the [...] "information" [...] box on their online collection database: [...] "The term is used for objects with a body made of finely powdered quartz grains fused together with small amounts of alkali and/or lime through partial heating. The bodies are usually colourless but natural impurities give them a brown or greyish tint. Colourants can also be added to give it an artificial colour. It can be modelled by hand, thrown or moulded, and hardens with firing. This material {{is used in the}} context of Islamic ceramics where it is described as stonepaste (or fritware). Glazed composition is related to glass, but glass is formed by completely fusing the ingredients in a liquid melted at high temperature. This material is also popularly called faience in the contexts of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Near East. However, this is a misnomer as these objects have no relationship to the glazed pottery vessels made in Faenza, from which the faience term derives. Other authors use the terms sintered quartz, <b>glazed</b> <b>frit,</b> frit, composition, Egyptian Blue, paste or (in the 19th century) even porcelain, although the last two terms are very inappropriate as they also describe imitation gems and a type of ceramic. Frit is technically a flux." ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this paper}} is to conduct a life cycle {{assessment}} study of ceramic tiles (single-fired glazed stoneware) in order to identify the stages that produce the greatest impact on the environment and the materials and/or processes that make the largest contribution to that impact. The life cycle is considered to be made up of seven stages: (1) mining the clay, (2) atomising the clay, (3) production of <b>frits</b> and <b>glazes,</b> (4) production of ceramic tiles, (5) distribution, (6) installation and usage, and, on ending their useful life (7) treatment as construction and demolition waste. Materials and methods. A specific life cycle inventory was developed taking 1 m 2 of ceramic tile over a period of 20 years as the functional unit and using annual data gathered directly from 35 Spanish enterprises involved in the different stages of the life cycle of ceramic tiles. This inventory was then used to obtain environmental indicators (global warming, ozone layer depletion, acidification, eutrophication, photochemical oxidation and human toxicity) for each enterprise and each stage of the life cycle under study. Results and discussion. Environmental data were submitted to a statistical analysis. This analysis made it possible to model the distribution of environmental behaviour of the life cycle of ceramic tiles considering the different influences from the different companies that were consulted for each stage in the life cycle. The statistical study allowed also obtaining confidence intervals for the mean and standard deviation of the environmental results obtained for each impact category. Conclusions. The stage of the life cycle with the greatest environmental impact for all the impact categories is the manufacture of the tile, followed by the process of atomising the clay and the distribution of the product. There is a direct correlation between these findings and the high level of energy consumption (mainly natural gas and fuel) in these stages. Moreover, the statistical analysis provided 95 % level of confidence intervals for the mean and the standard deviation very accurate which shows that using the mean inventory values from all the enterprises that were consulted within the same stage of the life cycle is a suitable method of working. Future users of the inventory may use the probability distributions obtained for calculating percentiles or other measures to assess their data...|$|R
