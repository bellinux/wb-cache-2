A typical application is the <b>immunosensor</b> based on an antibody layer that interacts selectively with a particular immunogen and reports about its content in a specimen. In the static mode of operation, the sensor response is represented by the beam bending with respect to a reference microcantilever. Alternatively, microcantilever sensors can be operated in the dynamic mode. In this case, the beam vibrates at its resonance frequency and a variation in this parameter indicates the concentration of the analyte.|$|E
50|$|An <b>immunosensor</b> {{utilizes}} {{the very}} specific binding affinity of antibodies {{for a specific}} compound or antigen. The specific nature of the antibody-antigen interaction is analogous to a lock and key fit in that the antigen will only bind to the antibody if it has the correct conformation. Binding events result in a physicochemical change that in combination with a tracer, such as a fluorescent molecules, enzymes, or radioisotopes, can generate a signal. There are limitations with using antibodies in sensors: 1.The antibody binding capacity {{is strongly dependent on}} assay conditions (e.g. pH and temperature) and 2. The antibody-antigen interaction is generally irreversible. However, {{it has been shown that}} binding can be disrupted by chaotropic reagents, organic solvents, or even ultrasonic radiation.|$|E
