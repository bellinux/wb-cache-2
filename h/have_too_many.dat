5|$|The Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works {{locomotive}} acquired {{along with}} them could not be restored. Built in 1902, this locomotive was {{the oldest of the}} five locomotives purchased and was determined to <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> problems to be rebuilt. It was stored out of use in California for a period before being sold to an unknown locomotive broker. Some of its parts were used to help restore the four Baldwin locomotives, including its smokestack, which was fitted to the WDWRR's No. 4 locomotive.|$|E
5|$|In Pasadena, {{high school}} {{students}} Costa and J.B. plan to throw a party for their friend Thomas' birthday, aiming to increase their popularity. Thomas' parents go away for the weekend, leaving him alone in the house, but warn him not to <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> people over, and not to drive his father's Mercedes. Thomas is reluctant to have the party at his house, but Costa continues with his plan. Costa hires AV-student Dax to chronicle the night's events. Costa and J.B. advertise the party throughout the school. Thomas himself invites Alexis, the hottest girl at school, and his best friend Kirby, who has a crush on Thomas.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fighting, the player {{can choose to}} talk to demons encountered on the field, and attempt to recruit them to their party; {{the success of this}} depends on the player's level, with more powerful demons only being recruitable if the player's level is sufficiently high. In Ronde, the player does not initiate these conversations themselves, however: instead, defeated demons sometimes choose to talk to the player, and sometimes decide to join their party. Like in other Megami Tensei games, the player can fuse multiple allied demons with each other, thereby creating more powerful demons. In Ronde, the player can form contracts with demons, allowing human characters to use demon magic. Demons are fueled by magnetite, so the player needs to manage the supply of this, and thus cannot <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> allied demons on the field at once or take too long to finish a battle. By clearing battles, the player can advance to the next chapter. The games' stories are affected by player choices, and have multiple endings.|$|E

25|$|Most fission {{products}} <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> neutrons to be stable {{so they are}} radioactive by beta decay, converting neutrons into protons by throwing off beta particles (electrons) and gamma rays. Their half lives range from milliseconds to about 200,000 years. Many decay into isotopes that are themselves radioactive, so from 1 to 6 (average 3) decays {{may be required to}} reach stability. In reactors, the radioactive products are the nuclear waste in spent fuel. In bombs, they become radioactive fallout, both local and global.|$|E
25|$|We <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> Jews in the towns. They {{are needed}} on the Polish border because in these areas Hebrews alone perform trade. As {{soon as you get}} away from the frontier, the Jews become a disadvantage, they form cliques, they deal in {{contraband}} and get up to all manner of rascally tricks which are detrimental to Christian burghers and merchants. I have never persecuted anyone from this or any other sect; I think, however, it would be prudent to pay attention, so that their numbers do not increase.|$|E
25|$|Child {{slavery is}} also {{considered}} a contemporary form of slavery, although its does come with debate {{as to what}} constitutes child slavery. However, child prostitution is widely considered a form of slavery in which children, mostly from South East Asia, South Asia, and Latin America, “are sold by their parents either because they are destitute, <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> mouths to feed, or are simply greedy”. On the other hand, in some cases of child prostitution, when parents give their children up to traffickers, they are deceived into believing that their child will earn good money, get an education, or learn a trade.|$|E

Of those surveyed, 39.1% believed that LGBT rights should be extended, 35.9% believed that the LGBT rights situation is satisfactory in Romania, while 15.6% of people stated that LGBT people <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> rights. 9.4% were undecided. Additionally, 71.9% {{of the young people}} surveyed stated that LGBT rights should be protected, indicating relatively high levels of acceptance among this demographic. A more recent research conducted by ACCEPT shows that 61% of students who have a different sexual orientation and recognize this have been physically or verbally bullied by their peers.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{contract}} Roberts syndrome, a child must inherit the defective gene in an autosomal recessive manner. In other words, the child must inherit {{two copies of}} the defective gene (one from each parent). The ESCO2 gene has a specific effect on cell division in Roberts syndrome patients. In normal cell division, each chromosome is copied and then attached to its newly formed copy at the centromere (the center portion of a chromosome). However, in Roberts syndrome cell division, the copies are frequently not attached at the centromere. As a result, the chromosomes do not get lined up properly, which causes the cell to divide very slowly or even to not divide at all. The new cells typically will <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> or too few chromosomes. The odd number of chromosomes causes the defective cells to die, {{which leads to the}} malformations associated with Roberts syndrome.|$|E

[...] He admitted his players had practiced taking penalties, but was quick to point out [...] "you don't score because of the practising – keeping your nerve is more important." [...] Lehmann, who had been side-lined by Wenger {{during the course of the}} season, credited his teammates for scoring all five penalties, and described it as a [...] "big mental achievement." [...] Cole called Arsenal's win a [...] "…great team performance, we didn't <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> chances but we defended really well and battled really hard."
