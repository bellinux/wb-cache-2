40|$|This article {{compares the}} pre and post {{migration}} position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labour market of recent migrants to the Netherlands from Poland and Bulgaria, regarding {{the extent to which}} migrants have a job, what their socioeconomic status is, and how satisfied they are with their income. The prime question is whether those migrants who found a <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands work <b>in</b> a lower socio-economic status job than before migration, with which we test {{the first part of the}} U-curve-hypothesis, putting forward that migration results in a loss of job status. We used the dataset 'Social and Cultural Integration Processes' (SCIP). This dataset collected information from migrants that registered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dutch Municipality Population Registers to a maximum of one and a half year before the start of the survey. We find evidence that almost all Poles have a <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands, but, excluding those who were in school in Poland before migration, most had a <b>job</b> <b>in</b> Poland as well. The situation for the Bulgarians is less positive, even though they more often have a <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands than they had in Bulgaria. Within both migrant groups the socioeconomic status of <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands is lower than the status of <b>the</b> last <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country of origin, but less so for family-motivated migrants and higher educated migrants.
