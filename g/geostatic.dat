40|$|The {{long-term}} {{performance of}} soil–bentonite slurry trench cut-off walls is {{highly dependent on}} the hydraulic conductivity of the soil–bentonite backfill, which according to laboratory tests can decrease significantly as consolidation pressure increases due to corresponding reductions in void ratio. Consequently a reliable estimate of the hydraulic conductivity of backfill in the field requires proper calculation of effective stresses. A model is proposed to predict the steady-state horizontal and vertical effective stresses in the backfill after consolidation. The arching effect is considered by way of force equilibrium, and the lateral squeezing effect of inward displacement of the trench side walls is considered by assuming the cut-off wall is surrounded by soil, which is represented by a Winkler idealisation. The proposed model is applied to consider a soil–bentonite slurry trench cut-off wall in New South Wales, Australia, and the predicted stress profile is in good agreement with that calculated from cone penetration test data. Compared to those predicted by <b>geostatics</b> and other alternative models, the proposed method offers a significant improvement in the prediction of stress in soil–bentonite slurry trench walls. The obtained stresses are then used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity in the backfill. It is found that the hydraulic conductivity is relatively high in the shallow region owing to the low state of effective stresses, which requires consideration in cut-off wall design, and decreases slightly with the depth in the deeper region. Finally a parametric study identifies the side wall friction and the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction of surrounding soil as having the most {{significant impact on the}} estimated stresses...|$|R
40|$|Mine {{planning}} for a new reserve is based on information obtained from exploratory coreholes. A critical component of an exploration program is the geotechnical evaluation. Poor assumptions about roof conditions greatly add to the risks of mining. Rock mechanics testing is central to a geotechnical exploration program. Typically, 3 to 5 uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) tests are made to characterize a particular roof unit at a given corehole. The average (mean) of these tests is taken as The UCS for that location. Isopach contour maps are then used to show spatial trends in roof strength. Two issues are raised by this traditional approach. The first {{is due to the}} large variability in UCS values that is typical even within a single unit from a single hole. The average UCS might be higher at Corehole A than it is at Corehole B, but the difference may not be statistically significant. The second issue is whether widely spaced coreholes can identify valid spatial trends in rock strength. The answer depends upon whether rock strength changes over distances that are longer or shorter than the corehole spacing. This is a classical geostatistical problem. While <b>geostatics</b> have been used to investigate many coal quality parameters, they have seldom been used to evaluate rock strength. This paper describes an extensive investigation of these issues conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in collaboration with Peabody Energy. The study employed the Peabody Rock Mechanics Data Base which contains more than 10, 000 individual test results. Data from four important roof units were subjected to statistical analysis: Brereton Limestone above the Herrin 6 seam (Illinois) Turner Mine Shale above the No. 9 Seam (Kentucky) Sandstone above the Eagle Coal (West Virginia) Shale above the Eagle Coal (West Virginia) The study did not find significant spatial trends in rock strength in any of the cases. Perhaps there are none, or perhaps the exploration coreholes were just too far apart to see them. These results have valuable implications for the design of geotechical exploration programs...|$|R

A full shadow of the Earth on the Moon has an apparent radius of curvature equal {{to the difference between}} the apparent radii of the Earth and the Sun as seen from the Moon.

This yields for the Earth-Moon distance 60.27 Earth radii or 384399 km This procedure was first used by Aristarchus of Samos and Hipparchus, and later found its way into the work of Ptolemy. The diagram at right shows how daily lunar parallax arises on the geocentric and <b>geostatic</b> planetary model in which the Earth is at the centre of the planetary system and does not rotate.

40|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{condition}} of soil and micro-climate condition, the mudstone area in the South-Western Taiwan was hard to plant and then always in bare condition which got a nickname of Moon World. Statistical data from 1967 to 1987 showed that the bare area increased from 2532. 58 to 3836. 28 hectares, then got to 11179. 5 hectares in 1997. The bare area has increased 3 times within ten years. According {{to the results of}} research, the bare areas of mudstone have already gotten to 15539 hectares in 2001. Sediment yielded in rivers of this mudstone area consequently increased; comparing with main rivers, it was the highest amount in the world. The vegetative degeneration, environmental pollution and land degradation caused the loss of agricultural productivity, microclimate change and environmental problems. Therefore, the ecological restoration in mudstone area is necessary. Therefore, the main idea of this research is considering about the environment and its transition of mudstone area in the South-Western Taiwan. According to the statistical data of soil, geology, geography, slope, weather in the studied areas, the factors of the expansion of mudstone area, the causes of erosion, pollution, and supply the suggestion to solve the problem were investigated. In the study, landscape ecology, geostatistics, multivariate analysis (factor analysis, canonical correlation analysis, cluster analysis) and structure equation modeling (SEM) were applied as the study methods, which would quantify and display the complex relationship among soil properties variation, erosion and natural environmental factors under different forestry features. The investigation of time and spatial variation of soil properties under four different forestry features, namely, original forest (thorn bamboo), clear cut, strip cut and cut and replant multi-layer vegetation on different slopeland. The results indicated that the highest variation of soil properties was found under the cut and replant multi-layer vegetation treatment, and there were not significantly different under other treatments. The major variations of surface soil (0 - 20 cm) properties were plant nutrients, which were affected by the vegetative cover. Plant nutrients (organic matter, and available phosphate) were accumulated in surface soil under multi-layer vegetation treatment, which will affect the species, distribution, and cover of plants. The distribution of plant nutrients in surface soil is related to movement of ion. Mobile Na and Mg ions were found in original forest (high erosive area). The sub-soil (20 - 40 cm) nutrient distribution is related to soil mineral and vegetation. The result of <b>geostatics</b> analysis indicated that, the variation of soil property in space is difference within positions. Especially, the nutrient of vegetation such as pH, organic matter, and available phosphate, is gathered in muti-layer vegetation area. In the respect of ecosystem, ecological index in different periods were calculated based upon landscape ecological theory. Markov Chain and Semi-markov Chain were used to predict the change of the future, the final condition of the land utilization of mudstone area; to explain its meanings, and the danger behind the bare mudstone area. The results indicated that, mosaic gathering was caused by mudstone and thorn bamboo. Mosaic is fracture and high edge. Therefore, energy and material flow in mosaic are faster which will cause soil and water resources loss. In study area, there are many styles of fracture, variation, and mosaic distribution landscape. The changing of landscape is due to road construction and human activity. The result calculated by Semi-Markov chain model showed that the percent of the area in forest land, plowing land, bamboo land and mudstone bareness are 2. 94 %, 2. 02 %, 54. 53 %, and 40. 51 % respectively. It also showed the risk of the bare of mudstone and evolving the landscape of mudstone with Thorn bamboo. The results illustrated that the landscape ecological factor such as patch shape factor, and Shannon evenness factor that have significant canonical correlation with water qualities and erosion of the study area. Finally, the expanded trend, reasons, the destructive ecosystem, and potential danger of mudstone were analyzed. We tried to find out a method to manage the ecosystem and improve the abnormal local microclimate, monotonous vegetation and disorder ecosystem in mudstone area. 台灣西南部泥岩地區，由於其特殊之土壤，地力流失消耗與區域微氣候型態之間的因果循環，在水土保持與景觀上形成不易植生綠化的地區及特殊之月世界地形。近十幾年間台灣西南部泥岩裸化面積有迅速增加之趨勢，從 1967 年的 2532 公頃， 1987 年的 3836 公頃，到 1997 年的 11179 公頃，且 1999 年 921 大地震後，中北部更有大量之泥岩出露於地表，到 2001 年 11 月已擴大為 15539 公頃。而泥岩出露在水土保持方面所引起之表土大量流失、崩塌，更造成主要河川含砂量激增、植被退化、環境污染及土地劣化之農業生產損失與微氣候變異等問題，顯示泥岩裸化所帶來之相關環境問題。 本研究以台灣西南部泥岩之不同林相土壤環境特性及其地景變遷為主軸,以了解佔泥岩大面積地景之竹林，其不同林相區內土壤理化變異及典型泥岩土地利用之景觀（地景）生態內涵，除蒐集有關前人於西南部泥岩之土壤、地質、地形、坡度及氣候等自然環境因子之特性與分布等方面之文獻外,予以整理歸納及現狀勘查並提出其裸露擴大原因,期能對所造成之土壤沖蝕、水質污染等環境生態災害研擬整治策略。在研究方法中,應用地景生態、地理統計、多變量分析(因素分析、主成分分析、典型相關、群團分析) 與結構方程模式等相關理論與統計技術,來量化及空間展示泥岩地區不同林相之土壤理化性質變異，沖蝕與自然環境因子相互間之複雜關係。 針對泥岩地區之原有造林植物及極優勢地景（刺竹）,在不同林相之坡面,土壤理化性質之時空變異與特性差異探討之。 結果顯示在四個林相區內，林相皆伐後複層植被區，土壤性質變異高於其他位置，而其他區之土壤理化性質在時間及空間上之變異不大，可明顯區分林相不同之顯著差異。不同林相對泥岩地淺層土壤（ 0 - 2 公分）理化性質的差異，以植物營養元素與植生覆蓋因子可充分說明（約佔變異範圍之 62 ﹪）。泥岩試區區中移動性物質 (交換性鈣、鈉與鎂) 明顯較少出現在複層林相處區，而易出現於淋洗、沖蝕量較大之刺林相保留區與隔叢擇伐區。 長效性植物營養元素因子（pH值與有效性磷），因長時間之林相不同，使其較明顯趨於複層林相區堆積，並影響地表植生之種類、分布與覆蓋情形。 0 ∼ 20 公分土壤性質的分布和離子間的移動特性有關，移動性高的鈉、鎂離子會在沖蝕量高之區域出現， 20 ∼ 40 公分土壤性質的分布則和土壤中之母質與植生有關，其次為可移動性離子的影響。應用地理統計分析法，瞭解土壤性質在空間之變化，其分布確實與不同林相位置有關，即植生營養元素（pH值、有效性磷）大都朝向複層植被區之趨勢，且地理統計所得之半變異圖結構變量，亦可與因素分析中之土壤性質結構變量結果相符合。地表覆蓋度與入侵植物數量兩變數主要係透過第一個典型因素與第二個典型因素而影響到複層植被區之pH值、有機質等土壤理化性質。 在泥岩生態能量變遷與生態量化部份,以景觀（地景）生態理論為基礎,計算各種地景生態指標,及其生態意涵在不同時期上之變異與能量循環上之改變,且利用馬可夫鏈、半馬可夫鏈模式,來預測泥岩地區未來之土地利用型態之最終改變情形及其生態代表意義,結果顯示嵌塊體的聚合大多由泥岩及竹林二種景觀（地景）所造成。嵌塊體較為破碎，邊緣較高，因此能量、物質和營養流在嵌塊體中的流轉較快亦較多，而這些流動主要為暴雨所帶來的沖刷，而致使水土資源大量流失。 泥岩試地區屬多樣性破碎、形狀變異與嵌塊體散佈結構之地景，因人為活動及自然干擾而導致景觀（地景）變遷，以半馬可夫鏈中計算得到的最終林地、農耕地、竹林、泥岩地景面積所佔比例依序為 2. 94 %、 2. 02 %、 54. 53 %與 40. 51 %，突顯出竹林與泥岩兩種地景之消長與變異及彰顯泥岩裸化所隱藏之生態危機。在地景生態水文方面，地景嵌塊體形狀因子與水質之有機營養鹽供給因子，具有整體性的高相關性。地景多樣性均一度因子，也能顯著地（影響到與水庫淤積量、沖蝕深度有關之集水區土壤沖蝕因子。 最後,整理分析西南泥岩部泥裸化擴大的趨勢、原因及其生態環境破壞與潛在危機,並就研究所得、研擬泥岩地區整體生態環境復育之治理之策,期能對日益擴大裸化、區域微氣候異常、植被單調化及生態失衡的西南部泥岩有所助益。目 錄 頁碼 中文摘要 ……………………………………………………………… 1 英文摘要 ……………………………………………………………… Ⅲ 目錄 …………………………………………………………………… Ⅴ 圖目錄 ………………………………………………………………… Ⅸ 表目錄 ………………………………………………………………… ⅩV 壹、緒論 ……………………………………………………………… 1 -

40|$|The {{long-term}} co-evolution of the geosphere–biospere complex {{from the}} Proterozoic up to 1. 5 billion {{years into the}} planet’s future is investigated using a conceptual earth system model including the basic geodynamic processes. The model focusses on the global carbon cycle as mediated by life and driven by increasing solar luminosity and plate tectonics. The main CO 2 sink, the weathering of silicates, is calculated {{as a function of}} biologic activity, global run-oV and continental growth. The main CO 2 source, tectonic processes dominated by sea-floor spreading, is determined using a novel semi-empirical scheme. Thus, a geodynamic extension of previous <b>geostatic</b> approaches can be achieved. As a major result of extensive numerical investigations, the ‘‘terrestrial life corridor’’, i. e., the biogeophysical domain supporting a photo-synthesis-based ecosphere in the planetary past and in the future, can be identified. Our findings imply, in particular, that the remaining life-span of the biosphere is considerably shorter (by a few hundred million years) than the value computed with <b>geostatic</b> models by other groups. The ‘‘habitable-zone concept’ ’ is also revisited, revealing the band of orbital distances from the sun warranting earth-like conditions. It turns out that this habitable zone collapses completel...|$|E

The kernel of this simulation is the numerical solution of a complex system of time dependent, three-dimensional partial dierential equations (PDE) of mixed parabolic-hyperbolic type.

40|$|The Directional Drilling {{technique}} is now widely used internationally {{to install and}} replace underground conduits. Drilling mud is used during both the pilot drilling and pullback processes as a multifunctional medium. Mud loss and other damage can occur due to hydrofracture or blowout {{in the vicinity of}} the borehole as a result of high mud pressure. Current design methods, either simple rules of thumb or the Delft equation, are used to estimate maximum drilling mud pressure associated with shear failure, and these implicitly or explicitly assume that the initial ground stress condition is isotropic (i. e. K 0 = 1). A new approach to estimate the limiting mud pressure is introduced in this paper which considers the effect of different initial <b>geostatic</b> stress conditions (K 0 ≠ 1). The limiting drilling mud pressure has been studied based on different ratios of shear strength to effective vertical stress (Cu/P’ 0) and different initial <b>geostatic</b> stress conditions (K 0), and the results are compared with current industry methods. The studies indicated that soil type and initial ground stress condition control the mode of mud loss. Blowout is the dominant failure mechanism in normally consolidated (NC) and lightly overconsolidated (LOC) clay. Hydrofracture will be expected in heavily overconsolidated (HOC) clays where the coefficient of lateral earth pressure exceeds 1. 8.

Aimed at a rope {{deployment}} mechanism, {{under the}} hypothesis that the rope can not extend, the kinematic relationship between the rods and the multi-rigidbody <b>geostatic</b> model of the mechanism are established. Through the simulation and the mechanical analysis of the deployment process, the prototype deployment experiment had been done with controlling of the trace of the deployment velocity. The consequence shows the displacement, power consumption and disturbance of the mechanism accord with the expectation value of the theoretic model. It more shows our model could reflect the characteristic of this kind of mechanism, and also provides the gist for the deployment mechanism design...|$|E

The excavation is 9 m deep and located in very soft soil. For the design project approach 2, according to Eurocode 7 was adopted. The necessary depth of anchored pile-wall and anchor force were calculated analytically. The internal forces (bending moments and shear forces) were calculated by using computer program SAP 2000 and were checked with Winkler spring model. Based on results we determined the critical bending moment and the anchor force in order to design pilots and beams. Global stability of construction was checked with the program SLIDE...|$|E
40|$|In {{fractured}} {{rocks of}} low permeability, the hydraulic {{properties of the}} rock mass are strongly influenced by the connectivity and fracture geometry of the fracture system, the stiffness and deformational properties of fracture surfaces and the <b>geostatic</b> stresses. This dissertation demonstrates through theoretical analysis the sensitivity of fracture connectivity and flow rate to fracture radius, fracture density and measurement scale. Percolation factor and percolation frequency are suggested as indices of connectivity and flow rate. Models of hydromechanical coupling, normal closure and simple geometrical joint systems are proposed to study fracture porosity and fracture permeability and are compared with measured values from published papers. Fracture surface characteristics are expressed as indices of JRC and JCS. The relation between fracture aperture and <b>geostatic</b> stress is also examined. Based on the percolation process, a three dimensional discrete fracture model with statistical parameters of fracture geometry is developed to investigate {{the relations between the}} connectivity and flow rate and the percolation factor and percolation frequency. This model has the capability to generate a fracture network and to solve for steady state flow. The flow through each fracture is discretized by the boundary element method. By performing numerical simulation, the percolation threshold was found to be in the range of 0. 9 to 2. 4 for orthogonal joint sets. There is a rapid increase in flow rate with increasing fracture density or fracture length as the percolation factor reaches the percolation threshold. The percolation factor and percolation frequency are scale-dependent. A fracture network with large fractures and a high fracture density has a high percolation frequency and a high percolation factor. A network with high percolation frequency and percolation factor has a high flow rate. A constitutive model linking the initial conducting aperture, mechanical conducting aperture, JRC, JCS, <b>geostatic</b> stress and fracture geometries can be used to predict fracture porosity and fracture permeability in terms of depth. Preliminary comparison with field data shows that models comprising three orthogonal sets and disc-type fracture models can be used to simulate observed behavior. Fracture porosity and fracture permeability based on a model of three orthogonal sets can be used to predict flow through volcanic rocks. For sedimentary rocks a model incorporating a model of three orthogonal sets and one parallel set can be used with varying levels of confidence...|$|E
30|$|The {{simulation}} {{is extremely}} simplified and dwarfs {{the complexity of}} the real problem. First, the actual geological information is disregarded. Second, the actual technology requires the drilling of the borehole, which causes a disturb on the <b>geostatic</b> stress state, and the pre-fracturing of the hydraulic fracturing sites through small explosions, which further modifies the original stress state and permeability. Third, the process control quantity is the amount of fluid injected, while the fluid pressure is an output parameter registered at the surface end of the borehole and not the actual (unknown) pressure. To determine the pressure at the hydraulic fracturing location, a complex fluid-dynamical problem involving a mixture of additives and water should be solved.|$|E
40|$|Chalk is {{affected}} by different diagenetic processes in comparison with other carbonate rocks. Commonly observed lithification processes are pressure-solution and reprecipitation and neomorphism. The first process is divisible into: (a) spot-welding or welding; (b) overgrowth; (c) stylolitization and cementation. Further, pressure-solution and reprecipitation is dependent on (a) <b>geostatic</b> pressure and (b) the ratio of Mg/Ca in the pore fluid. Overgrowth of calcite cement {{is controlled by the}} size and shape of the biogenic crystals. Neomorphism is also important in diagenesis. Neomorphic process dominates when pressure-solution process is ineffective. Organic and insoluble residue content dictate neomorphism.
