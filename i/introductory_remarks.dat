This was followed, in 1965, by Philip Larkin reads and comments on The Whitsun Weddings (Listen LPV6), again on the Marvell Press's record label (though the printed volume was published by Faber and Faber). Once again the poems are read in {{the order in which}} they appear in the printed volume, but with Larkin including <b>introductory</b> <b>remarks</b> to many of the poems. A recording of Larkin reading the poems from his final collection, High Windows, was published in 1975 as British poets of our time. Philip Larkin; High Windows: poems read by the author (edited by Peter Orr) on the Argo record label (Argo PLP 1202).

40|$|Abstract: Psychological {{game theory}} {{encompasses}} formal theo-ries designed to remedy game-theoretic indeterminacy and to predict strategic interaction more accurately. Its theoretical plu-rality entails second-order indeterminacy, but this seems un-avoidable. Orthodox game theory cannot solve payoff-dominance problems, and remedies based on interval-valued beliefs or pay-off transformations are inadequate. Evolutionary game theory ap-plies only to repeated interactions, and behavioral ecology is pow-erless to explain cooperation between genetically unrelated strangers in isolated interactions. Punishment of defectors eluci-dates cooperation in social dilemmas but leaves punishing behav-ior unexplained. Team reasoning solves problems of coordination and cooperation, but aggregation of individual preferences is prob-lematic. R 1. <b>Introductory</b> <b>remark...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In the Muqaddimahs <b>introductory</b> <b>remarks,</b> Ibn Khaldun {{agrees with}} the {{classical}} republicanism of the Aristotelian proposition that man is political by nature, and that man's interdependence creates {{the need for the}} political community. [...] Yet Ibn Khaldun argues, like Thomas Hobbes later, that men and tribes need to defend themselves from potential attack by beast or even unjust men, and thus political communities are formed. [...] The glue which holds such tribes together and eventually forms [...] "royal authority" [...] or the state, according to Ibn Khaldun, is ʿasabiyyah. Ibn Khaldun argues that the best type of political community is the Caliphate or the Islamic state, and argues that the neo-Platonist political theories of al-Farabi and Ibn Sina and the [...] "perfect state" [...] (Madinatu l-Faḍīlah) are useless because God's Law, the sharia, has been revealed to take account of public interest and the afterlife. [...] The second most perfect state, Ibn Khaldun argues, is one based on justice and consideration for public welfare in this life, but not based on religious law and so not beneficial to one's afterlife. [...] Ibn Khaldun calls this state blameworthy. [...] Yet the worst type of state, according to Ibn Khaldun, is a tyranny wherein government usurps property rights and rules with injustice against the rights of men.|$|E

40|$|A {{pedagogical}} {{description of}} a simple ungeometrical approach to General Relativity is given, which follows the pattern of well understood field theories, such as electrodynamics. This leads quickly {{to most of the}} important weak field predictions, {{as well as to the}} radiation damping of binary pulsars. Moreover, certain consistency arguments imply that the theory has to be generally invariant, and therefore one is bound to end up with Einstein’s field equations. Although this field theoretic approach, which has been advocated repeatedly by a number of authors, starts with a spin- 2 theory on Minkowski spacetime, it turns out in the end that the flat metric is actually unobservable, and that the physical metric is curved and dynamical. Short sections are devoted to tensor-scalar generalizations, the mystery of the vacuum energy density, and quintessence. 1 <b>Introductory</b> <b>Remark...</b>|$|R
