5|$|The Constitution <b>further</b> <b>provides</b> for the {{composition}} of a parliament which encompasses members of parliament (MPs) elected through Single Member Constituencies and Group Representation Constituencies, Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs). MPs are representatives of the electorate and have the role of raising concerns that the people may have. The Government's view is that representative democracy is better understood as regarding political parties rather than individual MPs as the fundamental element in the political system. While the judiciary is not a direct manifestation {{of the concept of}} representative democracy, it serves as a check on the Government and the legislature by ensuring that their powers are exercised within the limits established by the Constitution, such as the fundamental liberties in Part IV.|$|E

Victory Point <b>further</b> <b>provides</b> information on the shootdown of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command's 160th Special Operation's Aviation Regiment (Airborne) (SOAR(A)) MH-47 Special Operations Helicopter, which resulted in the deaths of 8 Navy SEALs and 8 Army Special Operations aviators,and the search for and recovery of Marcus Luttrell, the only survivor of the four-man Navy SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team.|$|E
25|$|Other presolar grains (AGB star grains) provide isotopic and {{physical}} information on asymptotic giant branch stars, which have manufactured the largest {{portion of the}} refractory elements lighter than iron in the galaxy. Because the elements in these particles were made at different times (and places) in the early Milky Way, the set of collected particles <b>further</b> <b>provides</b> insight into galactic evolution prior {{to the formation of}} the Solar System.|$|E
25|$|LDP is a {{reactive}} programming language. It {{has been}} used to trigger debugging in the earlier research. With the addition of language that enables the programmer to build operations {{in the development of the}} shape of the matrix, it can be used to analyze the distributed local conditions. It can operate on fixed-size, connected groups of modules providing various functions of state configuration. A program that addresses a fixed-size module rather than the entire ensemble allows programmers to operate the claytronic matrix more frequently and efficiently. LDP <b>further</b> <b>provides</b> a means of matching distributed patterns. It enables the programmer to address a larger set of variables with Boolean logic, which enables the program to search for larger patterns of activity and behavior among groups of modules.|$|E

25|$|The 25th Amendment {{explicitly}} {{states that}} if the President dies, resigns or is removed from office, the Vice President becomes President, and also establishes a procedure for filling a vacancy {{in the office of}} the Vice President. The Amendment <b>further</b> <b>provides</b> that the President, or the Vice President and Cabinet, can declare the President unable to discharge his duties, in which case the Vice President becomes Acting President. If the declaration is done by the Vice President and Cabinet, the Amendment permits the President to take control back, unless the Vice President and Cabinet challenge the President and two-thirds of both Houses vote to sustain the findings of the Vice President and Cabinet. If the declaration is done by the President, he may take control back without risk of being overridden by the Congress.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Gordon S. Shrimpton <b>further</b> <b>provides</b> {{an explanation}} for Xenophon's silence on much of Theban history. He notes that all the surviving contemporary accounts of Thebes {{during the period of}} Theban hegemony between 371 and 341 BC were often highly critical; with their failures ridiculed and their accomplishments usually being downplayed or omitted altogether. For instance, the Athenian Isocrates (436–338 BC) in his Plataicus (which details the destruction of Plataea by the Thebans), makes no mention of the Theban victory in Leuctra, and harshly reviles Thebes throughout. His later work Archidamus mention Leuctra briefly, and only to criticize Thebans as being incompetent and incapable of capitalizing on their rise to power. The same sentiments are echoed by the Athenians Demosthenes (384–322 BC) and Antisthenes (c. 445–365 BC). Xenophon, another Athenian, is the only contemporary who grudgingly notes some Theban accomplishments, and even then, never in-depth and with numerous omissions. His only mentions of Pelopidas and Epaminondas by name, for example, were very brief and shed no light on their previous accomplishments. Indeed, the historians Bruce LaForse and John Buckler have noted that the character and accomplishments of Epaminondas were so unassailable that there is no known hostile account of him in ancient sources. The most unfriendly writers like Xenophon and Isocrates could do was omit his accomplishments in their work altogether.|$|E

This post, also a Vice-President of the Commission, would chair the Council of the European Union's foreign affairs meetings {{as well as}} the Commission's external relations duties. The treaty <b>further</b> <b>provides</b> that the most recent European elections should be [...] "taken into account" [...] when appointing the Commission, although the President is still proposed by the European Council; the European Parliament [...] "elects" [...] the Commission rather than [...] "approves" [...] it as under the Treaty of Nice.|$|E

2500|$|If all lines {{designated}} by law become extinct, the constitution reserves {{the right for}} the Cortes Generales {{to provide for the}} succession [...] "in the manner most suitable for Spain". The 1978 constitution disinherits {{members of the royal family}} from succession if they marry against the expressed prohibition of the monarch and the Cortes Generales, as well as their descendants. Lastly, Article 57 <b>further</b> <b>provides</b> that [...] "Abdications and renunciations and any doubt in fact or in law that may arise in connection with the succession to the Crown shall be settled by an organic act".|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} social welfare is {{protected}} under Article 36 of the Basic Law, which <b>further</b> <b>provides</b> that [...] the welfare benefits and retirement security of the labour force shall be protected by law.

The Mandatory Provident Fund is a compulsory saving scheme (pension fund) for the retirement of residents in Hong Kong: both employees and employers have to contribute, as long as the salary of the employee exceeds a statutorily stipulated level. However, there is no social insurance in Hong Kong.|$|E
2500|$|A writ of {{habeas corpus}} is a legal action against {{unlawful}} detainment that commands a law enforcement agency or other body that has a person in custody to have a court inquire into {{the legality of the}} detention. The court may order the person released if the reason for detention is deemed insufficient or unjustifiable. The Constitution <b>further</b> <b>provides</b> that the privilege of the writ {{of habeas corpus}} may not be suspended [...] "unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it". In Ex parte Milligan (1866), the Supreme Court ruled that the suspension of habeas corpus {{in a time of war}} was lawful, but military tribunals did not apply to citizens in states that had upheld the authority of the Constitution and where civilian courts were still operating.|$|E

[...] This novella interprets the life experience of the Rice family in Stanstead, Suffolk, {{as well as in}} Berkhamsted, and it offers a purely fictional account of their departure from Southampton Harbor aboard the Confidence to Watertown, Massachusetts. [...] The story <b>further</b> <b>provides</b> an insight into the Rice family's life in Puritan Massachusetts during the political controversies generated as Sudbury and Marlborough were being founded and the experiences of the family during King Philip's War of 1675-78.|$|E
