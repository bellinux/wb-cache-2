5|$|Public {{reaction}} to the Who's concerts that included Tommy was overwhelmingly positive. The touring helped keep the album in the public eye, and cleared the band's debts.

Sykes, Jem, Scout, and Dill watch from the colored balcony. Atticus establishes that the accusers—Mayella and her father, Bob Ewell, the town drunk—are lying. It also becomes clear that the friendless Mayella made sexual advances toward Tom, and that her father caught her and beat her. Despite significant evidence of Tom's innocence, the jury convicts him. Jem's faith in justice becomes badly shaken, as is Atticus', when the hapless Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.|$|E

5|$|Development of Sonic Advance {{began after}} Sega shifted their focus to {{third-party}} software development, {{due to the}} underperformance of the Dreamcast. The company recruited Dimps—a Japanese development studio consisting of former Neo Geo Pocket Color programmers—to lead development, {{with the assistance of}} longtime series developer Sonic Team. While the game follows a similar style of gameplay to the Sega Genesis Sonic games, certain concepts and designs were re-used from newer titles such as Sonic Adventure. The game has since been ported to Nokia's N-Gage and Android devices, and <b>is</b> <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wii U via the Virtual Console.|$|E

5|$|It derives {{its name}} from Alexandria where it resided {{for a number of}} years before it was brought by the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch Cyril Lucaris from Alexandria to Constantinople. Then it was given to Charles I of England in the 17th century. Until the later {{purchase}} of Codex Sinaiticus, it was the best manuscript of the Greek Bible deposited in Britain. Today, it rests along with Codex Sinaiticus in one of the showcases in the Ritblat Gallery of the British Library.

5|$|Tayutama is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of Yuri Mito. Its {{gameplay}} mainly consists of reading and progressing through the story's narrative and dialogue.

Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which {{take the place of}} the regular background art and character sprites. When the game is completed at least once, a gallery of the viewed CGs and played background music <b>is</b> <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> game's title screen. Tayutama follows a branching plot line with nonlinear sequences and multiple endings, where the plot's direction is affected by the player's decisions.|$|E

5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Stéphane Sednaoui, brought even more mainstream success {{to the band}} through repeated airplay on MTV. The video debuted in September 1993. It was shot with low quality photographic equipment, which, like several other early Pumpkins videos, was an intentional stylistic decision. Corgan said that {{the plot of the}} video was inspired by a memory he had of an ice cream truck driver who, upon quitting his job, gave out his remaining stock of ice cream to the neighborhood children. This image was then melded with Sednaoui's own sensibilities inspired by the film Zabriskie Point. The video <b>is</b> <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Smashing Pumpkins – Greatest Hits Video Collection (1991–2000) DVD, released in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} hurricane {{was also}} previously unrecognized until contemporary research, {{although the majority}} of its track remains unknown.

As no other information <b>is</b> <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hurricane, it is listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as a single point in the central Atlantic (at 28.5°N, 50°W).|$|E
5|$|Production {{moved to}} the Czech Republic later in May, {{scheduled}} for 12 weeks of shooting, which included a scene in Pernštejn Castle. Using a former sugar factory in Prague, production designer John Myhre constructed a large textile factory {{as part of an}} industrial world, the setting of a mythological environment in which looms create fabrics that weavers interpret as assassination orders. Afterward, filming moved to Budapest, then returned to Chicago in August. While the actors performed many of their own stunts, with free running and parkour in some of the action scenes, and Angelina Jolie being actually strapped to the hood of a moving Dodge Viper, some of the especially high-risk sequences required digital doubles instead. Two full-sized train cars were built, a Chicago 'L' for a training scene where Fox and Wesley run atop a train, and a Czech Pendolino for the derailment, which was stationed in a gimbal equipped with hydraulics to allow the car to tilt and roll as the train crashed. The film originally had both an alternate opening and an alternate ending. The alternate opening, a flashback to ancient times describing the history of the Fraternity and the Loom of Fate, <b>is</b> <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> special edition DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E
