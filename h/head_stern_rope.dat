60|$|It was {{a splendid}} sunny {{afternoon}} when the kites were finally flown {{and attached to}} the three boats which were commanded respectively by the Captain Leo, and Alf. These three sat at the bow of each boat manipulating the regulators, and keeping the kites fluttering, while the goods and provisions were put on board. Then the Eskimo women and crews stepped in, and the <b>stern</b> <b>ropes</b> were cast loose.|$|R
6000|$|Solve {{pressed the}} hand of his friend in silence, and then went forward to assist {{actively}} in the preparations already referred to. The men heaped up the funeral pile round the mast, fastened the <b>stern</b> <b>ropes</b> to the shore, plied the dead upon the deck, and, when all was ready, hoisted sail. The squall had increased so that the mast bent, and the ship strained at her <b>stern</b> <b>ropes</b> like an impatient charger. Then the men went on shore, and Solve, turning to Guttorm, bent over him, and spoke a few words in a low, earnest tone, but the old man's strength was almost gone. He could only utter the single word [...] "Farewell", and wave his hand as if he wished to be left alone. Solve rose at once, and, applying a light to the pile, leaped ashore. Next moment the cables were cut; the brushwood crackled with a fierce noise as the fire leaped up and the [...] "ocean steed" [...] bounded away over the dark blue sea. Guttorm was still seated by the helm, his face pale as death, but with a placid smile on his mouth, and a strange, almost unearthly, fire in his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Glumm," [...] said Erling, {{when all}} were on board, [...] "we must say {{farewell}} to Norway. Keep close in my wake. If they give chase {{we will do}} our best to escape, but if that may not be, we will fight and fall together." [...] The friends shook hands; then, each getting into his ship, the <b>stern</b> <b>ropes</b> were cast off, the oars were dipped, and they shot out upon the blue fiord, which the sinking sun had left in a solemn subdued light, although his beams still glowed brightly on the snow-clad mountain peaks.|$|R
2500|$|When {{this was}} complete, the boat started {{back across the}} river under very low steam, and {{was caught in the}} current, and carried over the falls. [...] The rudder {{reportedly}} became uncontrollable. [...] The boat went broadside onto the breakwater, but then spun round and <b>headed</b> <b>stern</b> first over the falls, with the engine working the whole time.|$|R
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 30 December 1978, the freezer trawler Ben Asdale was off-loading fish into the hold of the Russian factory ship Antarktika (Антарктика), which was {{anchored}} in Falmouth Bay. A force eight gale was blowing and heavy snow was falling. When the Ben Asdale had finished discharging her cargo of mackerel, she cast off her <b>stern</b> <b>rope</b> in preparation {{to move away from}} the anchored Antarktika. The rope fouled her rudder and she would not respond to her helm. The skipper, Barney Coe, tried to get the Russians to re-secure the stern of his vessel but by now the fierce gale was dragging both boats. The Russians sent over two officers to assist in getting the steering working and shortly after the bow rope parted and the Ben Asdale was adrift.|$|R
5|$|Bligh {{hoped to}} find water and food on Tofua, then proceed to the nearby island of Tongatapu to seek help from King Poulaho (whom he knew from his visit with Cook) in {{provisioning}} the boat for a voyage to the Dutch East Indies. Ashore at Tofua, there were encounters with natives who were initially friendly but grew more menacing as time passed. On 2 May, four days after landing, Bligh realised that an attack was imminent. He directed his men back to the sea, shortly before the Tofuans seized the launch's <b>stern</b> <b>rope</b> and attempted to drag it ashore. Bligh coolly shepherded {{the last of his}} shore party and their supplies into the boat. In an attempt to free the rope from its captors, the quartermaster John Norton leapt into the water; he was immediately set upon and stoned to death.|$|R
60|$|Flora {{turned her}} <b>head.</b> His <b>stern</b> coldness hurt. She thought he feared her {{judgment}} would be merciless. Harry {{did not know}} her yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, boys," [...] said Gerald, {{speaking}} in French, [...] "we must keep her <b>head</b> and <b>stern</b> {{up and down}} the stream, or we shall make shipwreck." ...|$|R
50|$|The 3-man crew of a British LCP(L) {{were led}} by a Leading Seaman or Royal Marine Corporal coxswain who steered the boat and {{operated}} engine controls {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. Beside him was the Lewis gunner who also acted as bowman handling any rope-work forward. The third man was a mechanic who might also handle <b>stern</b> <b>ropes.</b> At other times LCP(L)s might be led or towed by coastal forces craft when a raid was within reasonable range of a sally port. A number of these raids were made in 1940 to 1942 by British forces, sometimes using LCP(L)s though more often going ashore by canoe. The first major landing from LCP(L)s in Europe took place in August 1942 when the Canadians with elements of the British army and Royal Marines landed at Dieppe. The fortunes of the LCP(L) flotillas showed here how units and even individual craft could have very different luck in a landing.|$|R
5000|$|He died on January 21, 1990. Ken Braun, <b>head</b> of <b>Sterns</b> Music's in the U.S., {{described}} Empompo Loway {{together with}} Modero Mekanisi as [...] "the best Congolese saxophonists of the 20th century".|$|R
50|$|Young was {{inspecting}} the new goldfields at Bermagui in 1880. In order to investigate possible sites further north, Young {{and his assistant}} travelled on a small boat with the boat's owner, Thomas Towers of Batemans Bay, and two of Towers' friends. All five disappeared on 10 October. In the morning the boat was observed, but stationary and with apparently only one man on board. Later in the day the vessel was seen stranded on the rocks with no-one on board. The boat was found to contain five bags full of clothing, Young's books and papers, a bullet in its starboard side and some vomit. The men were not found despite subsequent searches, rewards, government inquiries and wide media coverage. The remnants of a fire, some food and three shirt studs were the only traces. The mystery was never solved. Unusual aspects of the wreck were that the planks of the boat were stove-out rather than stove-in, the boat contained several large rocks and the anchor and <b>stern</b> <b>ropes</b> were missing.|$|R
60|$|He {{shook his}} <b>head,</b> his <b>stern</b> mouth shaping the strangest, twisted smile. It {{was indeed a}} twisted smile, for {{it was on the}} left side only, the facial muscles of the right side moving not at all.|$|R
5000|$|Sir Nicholas <b>Stern,</b> <b>head</b> of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.|$|R
50|$|Stern {{was the son}} of Hermann de Stern, a Portuguese baron and {{banker and}} the <b>head</b> of <b>Stern</b> Bros., of London, Paris and Belgium, and Julia Goldsmid. He was the first cousin of Lord Wandsworth and Sir Edward Stern.|$|R
6000|$|... "I tell you, Guinea," [...] {{returned}} the other, in a harsh, positive tone, [...] "the fellow is a know-nothing! Would any man, {{who understands the}} behaviour of a ship, keep his craft in a roadstead, when he might tie her, <b>head</b> and <b>stern,</b> in a basin like this?" ...|$|R
50|$|As with sewn boats, it is {{sometimes}} aesthetically adorned with heads (usually elk <b>heads)</b> on the <b>stern</b> post, thus might indicate shamanism.|$|R
60|$|This {{brought them}} to the {{starboard}} side, where they saw a hideous scene. Hundreds of people seemed to be fighting for room, with the result that some of the boats were overturned, precipitating their occupants into the water. Others hung by the prow or the <b>stern,</b> the <b>ropes</b> having jammed in the davits in the frantic haste and confusion, while from them human beings dropped one by one. Round others not yet launched a hellish struggle was in progress, the struggle of men, women, and children battling for their lives, in which the strong, mad with terror, showed no mercy to the weak.|$|R
60|$|He {{does not}} give any {{estimate}} {{of the time it}} took between the bursting of the dykes and the arrival of the waters, but it was probably an interval of about twenty minutes or half an hour. He was working now in darkness--save for the light of his lantern--and in a great wind. He hung out <b>head</b> and <b>stern</b> lights....|$|R
60|$|Racing indeed; for as Reinecke gallops up {{the narrow}} heather-fringed pathway, he brushes off his scent upon the twigs at every stride; and the hounds race after him, showing no head indeed, and keeping, for convenience, in one long line upon the track: but going <b>heads</b> up, <b>sterns</b> down, at a pace which no horse can follow.--I only hope they may not overrun the scent.|$|R
6000|$|... "That depends. I {{may find}} a use for it one day. If I do--Well," [...] said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her <b>head</b> with a <b>stern</b> kind of coquetry, [...] "I'll use it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tompkins," [...] {{said the}} Captain as the bosun's mate entered, [...] "be {{good enough to}} stand on the locker and stick your <b>head</b> through the <b>stern</b> port-hole, {{and tell me what you}} think of the weather." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{had neither}} mast or sail, anchor or cable, <b>head</b> or <b>stern,</b> no bows to fence off the waves, or rudder to steer any course, or oars {{to give any}} motion to their floats, whose bottoms were flat like a punt, so that they were obliged to thrust them along with such poles as they had, {{some of which were}} about eight or ten feet long, which gained them a little way, though very slowly.|$|R
50|$|His elder brother, Conte Quinto Mazzolini, {{served as}} Italian consul in Jerusalem, and {{undertook}} negotiations with Abraham <b>Stern,</b> <b>head</b> of the Lehi terrorist group, which sought (but failed) to obtain Italian recognition of Jewish sovereignty in Palestine {{in exchange for}} placing Zionism {{under the aegis of}} Italian fascism.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Please don't mind me,' said King, and Vernon very kindly did not. He {{ploughed}} on thus: 'He (Regulus) {{is related}} to have removed from himself the kiss of the shameful wife and of his small children as less by the <b>head,</b> and, being <b>stern,</b> to have placed his virile visage on the ground.' ...|$|R
60|$|Already {{communication}} {{with their friends}} outside had almost ceased, for the first operation of the enemy had been to block the approach to Sluys from the sea. Floats had been moored <b>head</b> and <b>stern</b> right across Zwin, and a battery erected upon each shore to protect them; but Captains Hart and Allen twice swam down to communicate with friendly vessels below the obstacle, carrying despatches with them from the governor to the States General, and from Roger Williams to the English commanders, urging that no time should be lost in assembling an army to march to the relief of the town.|$|R
60|$|He crossed some misty meadows by {{moonlight}} and {{the mist}} lay {{low on the}} grass, so low that it scarcely reached above his waist, and houses and clumps of trees stood out like islands in a milky sea, so sharply denned was the upper surface of the mistbank. He came nearer and nearer to a strange thing that floated like a boat upon this magic lake, and behold! something moved at the <b>stern</b> and a <b>rope</b> was whisked at the prow, and it had changed into a pensive cow, drowsy-eyed, regarding him....|$|R
5000|$|Wanted posters {{appeared}} {{all over}} the country with a price on Stern’s <b>head.</b> <b>Stern</b> wandered from safe house to safe house in Tel Aviv, carrying a collapsible cot in a suitcase. When he ran out of hiding places he slept in apartment house stairwells. Eventually he moved into a Tel Aviv apartment rented by Moshe and Tova Svorai, who were members of Lehi. Moshe Svorai was caught by British detectives who raided another apartment, where two Lehi members were shot dead, and Svorai and one other wounded were hospitalized. Stern’s Lehi “contact”, Hisia Shapiro, thought she might have been followed one morning and stopped bringing messages. On 12 February 1942 she came with one last message, from the Haganah, offering to house Stern {{for the duration of the}} war if he would give up his fight against the British. Stern gave Shapiro a letter in reply declining the safe haven and suggesting cooperation between Lehi and the Haganah in fighting the British. A couple of hours later British detectives arrived to search the apartment and discovered Stern hiding there. It was the mother of one of the [...] "Lehi" [...] members who inadvertently led the police to Stern's hiding place in Tel Aviv. Two neighbors were brought to attest to the propriety of the search. After they had left, Tova Svorai was also taken away so that Stern was alone with three armed policemen. Then, in circumstances that remain disputed today, Stern was shot dead.|$|R
50|$|Her problem-plagued voyage {{continued}} on 13 February when her rudder was damaged during heavy storms, {{resulting in a}} total loss of steering control with the rudder smashing into the hull at random. Three crewmen went over the <b>stern</b> on <b>ropes</b> and boatswain's chairs and secured it. The next morning, they rigged a temporary steering system. Badger set a course for the nearest port, and she arrived in Lisbon on 18 February. Slow dock services delayed her departure until 11 April and her voyage home did not end until 24 May. Carpenter's Mate Henry Williams, Captain of the Top Joseph Matthews, and Captain of the Top James Horton received the Medal of Honor for their actions in repairing the damaged rudder at sea. Constitution returned to her previous duties of training apprentice boys, and Ship's Corporal James Thayer received a Medal of Honor for saving a fellow crew member from drowning on 16 November.|$|R
50|$|Deerhound is a {{twin screw}} tug with the screws driven by two Lister-Blackstone 8-cylinder diesel engines via a {{reversible}} gearbox. This {{along with her}} twin rudders gives her high manoeuvrability for a traditional tug. She has a bollard pull of 17 tonnes making her powerful enough to work with every ship in the Royal Navy {{as well as a}} variety of barges and lighters. Towing can be done via her Clyde towing hook or from her forward bits on the bow. Barges are usually lashed up alongside with two springs and a <b>head</b> and <b>stern</b> line to allow for greater control around the dockyard.|$|R
50|$|She {{had a long}} flat floor, flared out {{to project}} at both <b>head</b> and <b>stern.</b> She was steered by a long sweep over the stern. Fourteen {{copper-clad}} water-tight cases, five on each side and four down the mid line provided buoyancy. Oars and two foul-weather sprit-sails provided propulsion and there was provision for self-draining when she was fully waterlogged. About 30’ overall and 7’ breadth, she was capable of supporting 25 men even when flooded. Her normal crew was six oarsmen and a coxswain. Gower remarked very emphatically that a coxswain should be in constant charge of her; for without such an experienced man, she would be almost useless.|$|R
60|$|In half an {{hour the}} two canoes came back again. They both kept well over to the {{opposite}} side of the river to avoid the full force of the current, and the sailor and Stephen attempted to count the <b>heads</b> in their <b>sterns.</b> They could not make out the number, but were inclined to agree that the two dark masses were about the same size.|$|R
60|$|I then {{carried him}} to our bark, {{and showed him}} what things we had here. He seemed amazed {{at the sight of}} our bark, having never seen {{anything}} of that kind before, for their boats are most wretched things, such as I never saw before, having no <b>head</b> or <b>stern,</b> and being made only of the skins of goats, sewed together with dried guts of goats and sheep, and done over with a kind of slimy stuff like rosin and oil, but of a most nauseous, odious smell; and they are poor miserable things for boats, the worst that any part of the world ever saw; a canoe is an excellent contrivance compared to them.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of model}} of a galleon sailing ship, ca. 1900. At center, a small replica of a galleon ship is seen sitting upon a {{rectangular}} wooden stand. The wooden frame and deck {{is supported by a}} large lightly-colored hull. A small rudder is visible near the stern of the ship. Two large masts are visible {{near the center of the}} ship, one small mast is seen extending at an angle from the bow, and two smaller masts are visible near the <b>stern.</b> Various <b>ropes,</b> pulleys, and ladders are seen connecting parts of each mast to the deck below. Imperial flags decorate the tops of each of the four masts on the ship. An elaborate shield emblem decorates one of the sails on the frontal mast, while ornate crosses decorate the sails of the center mast. Small shield emblems are also visible near the striped lining surrounding the deck. Each tall mast supports three large sails. The two masts near the stern of the ship each hold a small triangular sail, and a small sail connects to the angled mast...|$|R
