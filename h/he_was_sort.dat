At this point, Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and, as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987, {{he looked down at}} the setlist taped to the body of the guitar and saw the word [...] "Bob" [...] followed by a question mark. [...] "And I looked around," [...] Harrison recalled of Bob Dylan's entrance, [...] "and he was so nervous – he had his guitar on and his shades – <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of coming on, coming ...

[...] Director James Cameron said Kirby inspired the look of his film Aliens, calling it [...] "not intentional in the sense I sat down and looked at all my favorite comics and studied them for this film, but, yeah, Kirby's work was definitely in my subconscious programming. The guy was a visionary. Absolutely. And he could draw machines like nobody's business. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of like A.

2500|$|Prior to his casting as Gowron, Robert O'Reilly {{appeared}} in the [...] episode [...] "" [...] as a character referred to as Scarface. When casting was underway for the Jonathan Frakes directed episode [...] "", Frakes was looking for an actor who could portray a Klingon {{with a sense of}} humour. O'Reilly later remarked that he was considered because of what he called [...] "that crazy loon eyeball thing". He went directly from a performance of King Lear where he portrayed the character Edmund, and introduced elements of that character into the Klingon. O'Reilly described Gowron's initial appearances as being [...] "the only one with honor, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of a crazed warrior {{who did not want to}} be anywhere near 'hew-mons'". He felt that like Edmund, Gowron was an outsider who became a leader. He said that they were [...] "very, very similar in nature", and said that this set the character apart from the other Klingons who had appeared on the show until that point. Michael Westmore was in charge of designing the prosthetics for O'Reilly's performances as Gowron, describing it as one of his favourites of all the Klingons he's worked on because of the beard that comes down the side of his face.|$|E

So he propped Queen up an' tied the guns to his hands--an', Jim, the queerest thing aboot that deal was this--Queen's guns was empty! Not a shell left! It beat us holler....

Then we made for the hosses an' rode after Isbel. Pretty soon I seen him runnin' like a deer down the ridge. I yelled an' spurred after him. There is where Antonio quit me. But I kept on. An' I got a shot at Isbel. He ran out of sight. I follered him by spots of blood on the stones an' grass until I couldn't trail him no more. He must have gone down over the cliffs. He couldn't have done nothin' else without me seein' him. I found his rifle, an' here it is to prove what I say. I {{had to go back to}} climb down off the Rim, an' I rode fast down the canyon.
