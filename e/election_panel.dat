British <b>Election</b> <b>Panel</b> Study 1992 - 1997 The aim of the British <b>Election</b> <b>Panel</b> Study 1992 - 1997 (BEPS 1) is to analyse the interaction between long-term structural trends, medium-term economic and other influences, and short-term political factors {{and the way in}} which they determine the outcome of elections. The use of a panel enables the analysis of individual-level change in attitudes and behaviour over time. This study was previously held as an 'interim version' at the UK Data Archive. Following notification from the depositor, National Centre for Social Research (Natcen), in August 2001, that work has been completed, the current dataset is now confirmed as the final version of the study. No changes have been made to the dataset as a result of Natcen's work, and no further updates to the study are currently expected...|$|E

We present Bayesian methods for ignorable models and a particular non-ignorable model, and we argue that standard methods of model comparison are inappropriate for comparing ignorable and non-ignorable models. Uncertainty about ignorability of non-response is incorporated by introducing parameters describing the extent of non-ignorability into a pattern mixture specification and integrating over the prior uncertainty associated with these parameters. Our approach is illustrated using polling data from the 1992 British general <b>election</b> <b>panel</b> survey.

The British <b>Election</b> <b>Panel</b> Studies are designed to analyse political change - to discover when and why voters change their political allegiances during an electoral cycle, {{and in response to}} what events. They examine voting or abstentions in local government and European elections as well as fluctuations in party support during the lead-up to general elections. The British General <b>Election</b> <b>Panel</b> Study 1997 - 2001 followed respondents to the 1997 British General Election Study and re-interviewed them at intervals until the 2001 election. Face-to-face rounds took place each spring/summer after the local and/or European elections, with the final wave coming after the 2001 general election. Three telephone/postal rounds were conducted in autumn 1997, autumn 2000 and in May 2001, during the 2001 general election campaign. The dataset includes all eight waves. The study follows a similar panel conducted over the period 1992 - 1997 (the British <b>Election</b> <b>Panel</b> Study 1992 - 1997, held under SN: 3888). The main aim {{of this study is to}} analyse political change within the electorate over the period between two panels. Main Topics : The file (beps 9701. por) contains data from all eight waves of the panel: Wave 1 : 1997 : 3, 615 respondents to the 1997 British General Election Study; Wave 2 : 1997 : 2, 989 respondents to the autumn 1997 telephone/postal wave; Wave 3 : 1998 : 2, 807 respondents to the spring/summer 1998 face-to-face wave; Wave 4 : 1999 : 2, 570 respondents to the spring/summer 1999 face-to-face wave. Wave 5 : 2000 : 2, 400 respondents to the spring/summer 2000 face-to-face wave. Wave 6 : 2000 : 2, 293 respondents to the autumn 2000 telephone/postal wave. Wave 7 : 2001 : 2, 300 respondents to the spring 2001 telephone/postal wave. Wave 8 : 2001 : 2. 300 respondents to the spring/summer 2001 face-to-face final wave. The sample includes a Scottish boost. The topics covered include: Newspaper readership and campaigns, electoral registration, media exposure, party preference, local elections, party images, leader images, assessment of Conservative government, European Union, Northern Ireland, nuclear weapons, nationalism, ethnic minorities, women's rights, abortion, trade unions, political trust, economic evaluations, political knowledge, class identity/constitutional issues, unemployment and inflation, taxation, government services, nationalisation, privatisation, redistribution of income.

We look at changes in attrition rates in the American National Election Studies from 1964 to 2004, a repeated panel survey with a two-wave pre-post election design implemented over multiple decades. We examine changes in attrition rates by three groups of variables: sociodemographic and ecological characteristics of the respondent and household, party affiliation and political and social attitudes recorded at the first interview, and paradata about the first wave interview.

With appropriate modeling, these samples can be leveraged to correct inferences for biases caused by non-ignorable attrition. We present such a model when the panel includes many categorical survey variables. The model relies on a Bayesian latent pattern mixture model, in which an indicator for attrition and the survey variables are modeled jointly via a latent class model. We allow the multinomial probabilities within classes to depend on the attrition indicator, which offers additional flexibility over standard applications of latent class models. We present results of simulation studies that illustrate the benefits of this flexibility. We apply the model to correct attrition bias in an analysis of data from the 2007 - 2008 Associated Press/Yahoo News <b>election</b> <b>panel</b> study...|$|E

40|$|Fixed effect {{models have}} become {{increasingly}} popular {{in the field of}} sociology. The possibility to control for unobserved heterogeneity makes these models a prime tool for causal analysis. As of today, fixed effects models have been derived and implemented for many statistical software packages for continuous, dichotomous and count-data dependent variables. Chamberlain (1980) derived the multinomial logistic regression with fixed effects. However, this model has not been implemented in any statistical software package, yet. Possible applications would be analyses of effects on employment status with special consideration of part-time or irregular employment, and analyses of the effects on voting behavior, that implicitly control for long-time party identification rather than having to measure it directly.

There is no previous research on the general impact of participation in the electoral process on support for the political system. In this study, we hypothesize – based on the procedural fairness theory – that participating in elections raises the voter’s political trust, irrespective of the result of the party s/he voted for. Furthermore, we expect this impact to be largest for voters with the lowest level of internal political efficacy. These expectations are investigated using the Belgian <b>Election</b> <b>Panel</b> (2009 - 2014) study, observing political trust before and after the elections in two consecutive electoral cycles.

The causes of individual heterogeneity in knowledge have gone relatively unexplored however. What leads some individuals to become political sophisticates and others not? Generally, motivation has been considered as key in this regard; those who are interested in politics seek out and retain political information which leads, in turn, to higher levels of interest in politics. Using data from the 1992 - 1997 and 1997 - 2001 British <b>Election</b> <b>Panel</b> Studies, however, we find no evidence of a reciprocal effects mechanism. Although this ‘virtuous circle’ model of sophistication has accrued some empirical support in the US, with British data we find evidence only for a uni-directional effect from interest to knowledge.

Multidimensional models of racial identity have aimed to capture the vary-ing character of ethnic identity orientations across the African American community, as well as the developmental evolution of ethnic identity within the individual’s life course (e. g., Cross, 1971, 1978; Parham, 1989; Thomas, 1971).

40|$|Several {{theoretical}} hypotheses {{are developed}} concerning {{the relation of}} question and respondent characteristics to the reliability of survey attitude measurement. To test these hypotheses, reliability is estimated for 96 survey attitude measures using data from five, 3 -wave national reinterview surveys-three Michigan <b>Election</b> <b>Panel</b> Surveys and two reinterview studies conducted by the General Social Survey. As hypothesized, a number of attributes of questions are linked to estimated reliability. Attitude questions with more response options tended to have higher reliabilities, {{although there are some}} important exceptions. More extensive verbal labeling of numbered response options was found to be associated with higher reliability, but questions explicitly offering a “don't know” alternative were not found to be more reliable. Question characteristics were confounded to an unknown degree with topic differences of questions, which were significantly linked to reliability, leaving the influence of question characteristics on reliability somewhat ambiguous. Characteristics of respondents were also found to be related to levels of reliability. Older respondents and those with less schooling provided the least reliable attitude reports.

The paper considers {{the effect of this}} non-standard behaviour on two methods of interval estimation based on the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator. The first method relies on the estimator being approximately normally distributed with variance equal to the inverse of the information matrix. It is shown that the information matrix is singular for boundary solutions, but intervals can be calculated after a simple transformation. For the second method, based on the bootstrap, asymptotic results suggest that the coverage properties may be poor for boundary solutions. Both methods are compared with profile likelihood intervals in a simulation study based on data from the British General <b>Election</b> <b>Panel</b> Study. The results {{of this study indicate that}} all three methods perform poorly for a parameter of the non-response model, whereas they all perform well for a parameter of the margin model, irrespective of whether or not there is a boundary solution.
