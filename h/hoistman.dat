25|$|There are {{currently}} {{a total of}} four principal configurations designed by Airbus Helicopters for the EC225. The passenger transport version has a crash-worthy seating arrangement for up to 19 passengers with a high-density seating arrangement accommodating up to 28 passengers available to be fitted. The VIP transport version has a large lounge with seating for up to 12 passengers and a cabin attendant. The emergency medical services (EMS) configuration has medical units for six stretchers and four seats for medical workers. The search and rescue (SAR) configuration allows space for search and rescue equipment with an operator seat, <b>hoistman</b> seat and up to eight rescue seats and three stretchers. While a single pilot is capable of controlling the aircraft under visual meteorical conditions, two pilots are used in a typical crew compliment and, dependent on role, a cabin attendant or flight engineer may also be present.|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{communication}} and monitoring systems were developed and demonstrated in three underground mines representing different mining techniques, geographical areas, and material mined. The first mine {{was a large}} coal mine in western Pennsylvania that used room and pillar techniques and continuous mining methods. The system developed for this mine provided private telephone channels, environmental monitoring, and control of underground equipment, all on a single coaxial cable, with all system operations {{under the direction of}} a minicomputer. Many advanced features were incorporated into the system, such as paging of roving personnel, two-way section wireless, through-the-earth emergency communication, and redundant signal paths. Television was multiplexed into the system for underground equipment surveillance. A hoist radio system completed the complement of equipment at the mine. The second mine was a magnetite ore mine in eastern Pennsylvania that used block caving mining techniques. A radio system was developed that provided two-way communications between trackless vehicles and roving personnel. A unique system of uhf/vhf repeaters combined with a flleaky-feeder" transmission line offered operational and emergency features not previously found in mine communication systems. Evacuation alarming, personnel paging, fan-hole drill operator communications, and maintenance and safety vehicle dispatch were provided. The system required no dispatcher and operated during power failure. A hoist communications/shaft inspection system completed the installation. The third mine was a deep silver mine in the Cour d 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 Alene district of Idaho. The system developed for this mine utilizes a single wire pair to provide up to 14 voice channels. A unique combination of PBX, telephone carrier system, and intercoms offered private conversations, selective signaling, and emergency backup communications. Two hoist communication systems were installed to provide a voice link and in-cage belling signal between <b>hoistman</b> and cage...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND A mine shaft is the {{lifeline}} to underground mines. Mine operators {{depend on}} safe, uninterrupted, and efficient {{movement of workers}} and materials. The shaft and hoisting system provides access to the network of openings used to recover the underground resource, provides vertical transport of miners and materials, and serves as an escapeway {{in case of an}} emergency. Accidents involving hoisting can be catastrophic. Such was the case in 1973 at the Markham Colliery in Derbyshire, UK when the conveyance overwound and fell to the shaft bottom, resulting in 17 deaths. Hoist and elevator machinery must meet the requirements specified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 57 and 75. According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) data, many shaft-related accidents in the United States are associated with the hoisting cycle. MSHA statistics show that there were about 1500 shaft- related accidents in the 5 -year period between 1992 - 1996. Most of these accidents resulted from the action, motion, or failure of the hoisting equipment or mechanism and involved movement of the conveyance which includes cages, skips, ore buckets, and elevators. A hoisting hazard may be characterized as an "unsafe hoist operating condition caused by insufficient or inaccurate information available to the hoist operator" (authors' quote). Earlier investigators have defined safety features and operating and maintenance standards for hoists, and reported on monitoring and control systems and sensors for hoists and conveyances [Farley, 1983; Ward, 19931. However, despite the considerable technological progress and hoisting control improvements in recent years, safety- related issues that require further investigation still remain. The hoist operator must constantly be aware of two important hoist-operating conditions: the position of the conveyance and the tension in the hoist rope. If this information is not available or is inaccurate, the hoist becomes unsafe. Current technology provides this information indirectly from sensors and indicators in the hoist room. However, unlike a building elevator hoistway, mine shaft hoistway problems often include: 1. poor ground conditions and excessive shaft wall and guide displacement; 2. rock bursts in deep mines (resulting in large rock movements and fragments blocking the hoist way); 3. water, ice, and salt buildup (impeding the smooth flow of the conveyance); 4. severe vibration from hoisting (resulting in loose guide support brackets, broken welds, or other alignment and conveyance mechanism malfunctions). The second issue relates to dynamic rope loads applied during normal winding, particularly during loading, acceleration, and stopping. Safety factors on wire rope are based on static load. They are artificially high to account for all cases of dynamic loads, even though the total load history on the rope (static and dynamic) during service is unknown. Therefore the tension, and thus the compliance with wire rope load safety factors, is unknown to the <b>hoistman...</b>|$|E
