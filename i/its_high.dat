5|$|Dysprosium {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, {{but it was}} not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for <b>its</b> <b>high</b> thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for <b>its</b> <b>high</b> magnetic susceptibility in data storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.|$|E

5|$|Williamson's {{work during}} this decade was his most {{prolific}} {{in terms of}} comic book work and has garnered considerable praise for <b>its</b> <b>high</b> quality.

Williamson was single during this period and, according to The Art of Al Williamson, had a bohemian and undisciplined lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{physical}} {{difference between}} these metals is their density, with zirconium having about one-half the density of hafnium. The most notable nuclear properties of hafnium are <b>its</b> <b>high</b> thermal neutron-capture cross-section and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece. In contrast with this, zirconium is practically transparent to thermal neutrons, and {{it is commonly used}} for the metal components of nuclear reactors – especially the cladding of their nuclear fuel rods.|$|E

5|$|A {{reflective}} layer behind the tiger shark's retina, called the tapetum lucidum, allows light-sensing cells {{a second chance}} to capture photons of visible light, enhancing vision in low-light conditions. A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements. <b>Its</b> <b>high</b> back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly on its axis, though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail.|$|E
5|$|According to Ito, the Super Famicom {{release was}} a great success for the company, helping {{establishing}} it as both a developer and publisher.
