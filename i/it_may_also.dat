5|$|The common stinkhorn can {{be found}} {{throughout}} much of Europe and North America, and {{it has also been}} collected in Asia (including China, Taiwan, and India), Costa Rica, Iceland, Tanzania, and southeast Australia. In North America, it is most common west of the Mississippi River; Ravenel's stinkhorn (Phallus ravenelii) is more common to the east. The fungus is associated with rotting wood, and as such it is most commonly encountered in deciduous woods where it fruits from summer to late autumn, though <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be found in conifer woods or even grassy areas such as parks and gardens. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> form mycorrhizal associations with certain trees.|$|E

5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics.|$|E

It is also frequently found in shrublands, woodlands, agricultural fields, and mangroves, often adjacent to water, such as rivers, streams, rice paddies, and ditches. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> sometimes be found in villages and suburban areas.

5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E
5|$|Bridging the {{gap between}} self-expressive {{piercing}} and spiritual piercing, modern primitives use piercing {{and other forms of}} body modification as a way of ritually reconnecting with themselves and society, which according to Musafar once used piercing as a culturally binding ritual.

5|$|Doxorubicin {{interacts with}} DNA by {{intercalation}} and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits {{the progression of}} topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> increase quinone type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{distinctive}} position, the foramen {{is used as}} an anatomical landmark during neurosurgery. As a landmark, the foramen spinosum reveals the positions of other cranial foramina, the mandibular nerve and trigeminal ganglion, foramen ovale, and foramen rotundum. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be relevant in achieving haemostasis during trauma surgery.|$|E

5|$|Ideasthesia {{theory of}} art {{may be used}} for {{psychological}} studies of aesthetics. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> help explain classificatory disputes about art as its main tenet is that experience of art can only be individual, depending on person's unique knowledge, experiences and history.
