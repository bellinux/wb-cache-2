40|$|In this paper，a {{theoretical}} {{analysis is}} carried out {{about the influence of}} the 	outer peripheral edge effects of rotating disks on the flow between them，for 	the purpose of obtaining an accurate performance of a disk <b>friction</b> <b>pump.</b> The 	outer peripheral edge effects of rotating disks on which no available reports 	exist，are caused by that the fluid pumped out from the passage between rotating 	disks is braked by the stationary parts which constitute a diffuser element 	of the pump. 	The results of the theoretica 1 analysis of the edge effects are summarized as 	fol 1 ows: 	(1) When the ratio of outer radius of rotating disks to disk clearance 	increases， the azimuthal velocity of fluid at the outer periphery of disks 	increases and approaches half of that of disks. 	(2) On the periphery distant by a disk c 1 earance from the outer edge， the 	fluid inside the rotating disk passage does rigid body rotation and that 	inside the stationary f 1 ow passage is almost at rest; The outer peripheral 	edge effects of disks vanish there. 	(3) The radial and axial flow is constituted by the linear superposition of two 	f 1 ows; namely the flow due to centrifugal force and Poiseui 1 le flow. Therefore，when the flow rate through the rotating disks increases，the f 1 ow due 	to centrifugal force is swept away outside of disks and the edge effects 	manifest themselves weakly...|$|E
40|$|Aim. Experimental {{evaluation}} of the viscous friction disk pump efficiency, studying the relationship between inter-disk clearance and sizes of input and output ports and pump performance parameters. Materials and methods. To assess the characteristics and to optimize the disk <b>friction</b> <b>pump</b> design the pump model and experimental stand were created. Pump dimensions were set {{on the basis of}} medical and biological requirements for mechanical heart support systems and with due consideration of the experimental studies of our colleagues from Pennsylvania. Flow volume of the working fluid was measured by float rotameter Krohne VA- 40 with measurement error of not more than 1 %. The pressure values in the hydrodynamic circuit were measured using a monitor manufactured by Biosoft-M. Expansion device allowed changing the flow resistance of the system simulating the total peripheral resistance of the circulatory system. Results. Linear direct correlation between the pump performance and the pressure drop of liquid being created at the inlet and outlet of the pump was obtained.  The required flow rate (5 – 7 l/min) and pressure (90 – 100 mmHg) were reached when the rotor speed was in the range of 2500 – 3000 rev/min. It has been shown that the increase of the inlet diameter to 15 mm has not resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} pump performance, and that the highest efficiency values can be obtained for the magnitude of inter-disk gap of 0. 4 – 0. 5 mm. Conclusion. Designed and manufactured experimental disc pump model for pumping fluid has showed the fundamental possibility to use this model as a system for mechanical support of the heart. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a solar liquid collector {{can be improved}} by augmenting heat transfer from the tube to the working fluid. Various types of heat transfer techniques {{has been used in}} heat exchangers which are mainly classified in active and passive types of techniques. Solar liquid collectors can also be enhanced by these active and passive devices. The passive devices do not require any external source of power and they do not harm structure of the tube or weaken the strength of tube material. For the same reasons passive devices are most widely used heat transfer augmentation techniques. Initially twisted tape inserts and conical inserts were popular devices used in enhanced solar liquid collectors mainly because of availability of established correlations of design parameters. Wire coil inserts are relatively less used and less experimented passive technique. Presence of well established correlation of design parameters does not mean that twisted tapes are the best heat transfer augmentation device.

50|$|An engine {{has many}} moving parts that produce {{friction}}. Some of these friction forces remain constant (as long as applied load is constant); {{some of these}} friction losses increase as engine speed increases, such as piston side forces and connecting bearing forces (due to increased inertia forces from the oscillating piston). A few friction forces decrease at higher speed, such as the friction force on the cam's lobes used to operate the inlet and outlet valves (the valves' inertia at high speed tends to pull the cam follower away from the cam lobe). Along with friction forces, an operating engine has pumping losses, which is the work required to move air {{into and out of}} the cylinders. This pumping loss is minimal at low speed, but increases approximately as the square of the speed, until at rated power an engine is using about 20% of total power production to overcome <b>friction</b> and <b>pumping</b> losses.|$|R

The entire transient phase, starting from the engine cranking until the catalyst warm-up is completed, was taken into account in the simulation, and the model was validated using a wide data-set of experimental tests. The first step of the modeling activity was the combustion analysis during the transient phase: the burn rate was evaluated on the basis of experimental in-cylinder pressure data, considering both cycle-to-cycle and cylinder-to-cylinder variations. Then, as far as the exhaust temperatures are concerned, a detailed model of the thermocouples was implemented to replicate the physical behavior of the sensors during the warm-up and to compare the simulated temperatures with the measured ones. Finally, a complete analysis of the energy balance during the transient was carried out: the thermal power available to the catalyst inlet was obtained from a complete analysis of power losses (i. e. <b>friction</b> and <b>pumping</b> losses, in-cylinder heat transfer, engine block and engine coolant heating, exhaust manifold heat transfer, etc.).
