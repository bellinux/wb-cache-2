5|$|Groomed trail skiing {{occurs at}} facilities, such as Nordmarka (Oslo), Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort and Gatineau Park, Quebec, where trails {{are laid out}} and groomed for both classic and skate-skiing. Such {{grooming}} and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that adapt to {{the condition of the}} snow. Trail preparation employs snow machines that tow snow compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to the condition of the snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition of the snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets <b>homologation</b> standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation or national standards. Standards address course distances, degree of difficulty with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors. Some facilities have night-time lighting on select trails—called lysløype (light trails) in Norwegian and elljusspår (electric light trails) in Swedish. The first lysløype were opened in 1946 in Nordmarka and at Byåsen (Trondheim).|$|E
5|$|The Whistler Sliding Centre in Whistler, British Columbia was {{the site}} of women's {{skeleton}} at the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, Canada. The track was constructed between 2005 and 2008, and became only the 15th competition-level track in the world. It was certified for competition in sliding sports by the International Luge Federation (FIL) and the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation (FIBT) in March, 2008 in a process called <b>homologation</b> where hundreds of athletes ran the track. This was the first time many competitors at the 2010 Games were able to try the track and begin to develop strategies for it. Canadian athletes hoped that having it open two years before the Games, and having that amount of time to train on it, would give them an advantage in the Games. The Whistler Sliding Centre quickly gained {{a reputation as one of}} the fastest tracks in the world.|$|E
5000|$|... 47 {{cars have}} been homologated in Group GT3 by the FIA, {{although}} {{four of these}} <b>homologations</b> have expired.

25|$|The 2,500 road-going {{examples}} sold (required for <b>homologation</b> purposes) were made, but {{demand for}} the car was so high that Ford kept producing them. Later models (1995 up) have a smaller turbo than the <b>homologation</b> versions and came with the whale-tail spoiler as an option. The Escort Cosworth ceased production in 1996, but it has already achieved classic status and has a huge following. However, the car wasn't mechanically an Escort, being based on the four-wheel drive Sierra floorpan and mechanicals, including its longitudinally mounted engine, and was merely clothed in body panels to resemble a Mark V.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, the car missed <b>homologation</b> for the 1965 {{season and}} was not raced by the Shelby team. However, it was raced {{successfully}} by many privateers {{and went on to}} win races all the way into the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|The N-acetylcystamine (SNAC) {{thioester}} of dodecapentaenoic acid, {{an analog}} of a putative intermediate in the biosynthesis of Heat Stable Antifungal Factor (HSAF), is synthesized. Key steps include sequential Horner–Emmons <b>homologations</b> with the Weinreb amide of diethylphosponoacetic acid, and thioesterification of an aldol-derived 3 -hydroxyalkanoate, {{which serves as}} a stable precursor of the sensitive polyenoate. The thioester was investigated as a biosynthetic substrate using a purified nonribosomal peptide synthetase and was not incorporated in the observed products...|$|R
25|$|The first AC {{member of}} the TRAXX2 family, which {{featured}} carbodies with improved crashworthiness and water-cooled IGBT-based inverters, was the demonstrator loco 185 561, delivered in May 2004.

40|$|A proper {{reflection}} {{about the}} music in the masses era can develop itself only if it’s interwoven with the media totalitarianism {{which seems to be}} the fate of our times. Beyond the ideology and the fashion of “contamination” that leeds towards a levelling of values, it’s much better to sharpen instead the real difference between the distinct practices of listening, without academic prejudices but also without misleading <b>homologations.</b> Neither puritanisms nor false transgressions: classical music and pop music must be received iuxta propria principia, each of them along its own specific language...|$|R
50|$|For the 2011 season, the GT3 {{class was}} brought {{right up to}} date with the {{inclusion}} of new FIA homologated cars. This gave teams the options to run the new Ferrari 458 Italia or the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT3 {{as well as the}} currently homologated cars. New to 2011 season was the introduction of the GT3B class catering for older, GT3 spec cars which do not conform to the latest FIA <b>homologations.</b> This should allow the running of cars such as the Dodge Viper Competition Coupe or Ferrari F430.|$|R
40|$|The book Deep Experiencing: Dialogues {{within the}} Self written by Olga Lehmann and Jaan Valsiner offers a glimpses of that restless search for novelty which {{characterize}} {{the very first}} steps of almost all the younger researchers who, often, are prematurely sacrificed at the altar of the so called scientific research. Nowadays academia {{is becoming more and}} more the place of repetition and <b>homologations</b> instead of the place of innovations and “cultural revolution”.

50|$|Further <b>homologations</b> {{grants from}} the Confederation of Australian Motorsport (CAMS) in August 1983 saw the VH Commodore SS once again the car to beat. Peter Brock set pole {{position}} at the 1983 James Hardie 1000 (VH Commodores filled seven of the top 10 spots on the grid), and although his own car suffered a rare engine failure on lap 8 of the race, he and Perkins then moved into the teams second car with its lead driver John Harvey {{to go on and}} win the race. The second HDT car was in fact the 1982 winning car giving the Commodore the distinction of being the only car to twice win the Bathurst 1000. The VH Commodore would fill six of the top 10 finishing positions in the race.|$|R
5000|$|The {{regulations}} and <b>homologations</b> for Group GT3 were {{prepared by the}} FIA and ready {{by the start of}} the 2006 season, with eight manufacturers represented as the first Balance of Performance test prior to the debut of the FIA GT3 European Championship. [...] The British GT Championship, International GT Open, Spanish GT Championship, and Italian GT Championship all created a category specifically for the FIA's new Group GT3 machines. The SRO Group expanded the category in 2007 with the launch of two new regional championships, the Brazilian GT Championship and the German ADAC GT Masters, exclusively running Group GT3 cars. The British GT Championship abandoned Group GT2 cars, promoting GT3 to their premiere category, while the Belcar series reorganized their class structure to introduce GT3 as their lead class. The French FFSA GT Championship also added a new GT3 category.|$|R
25|$|The Maserati MC12 Corsa is {{a variant}} of the MC12 {{intended}} for racetrack use.

25|$|The circuit <b>homologation</b> {{design was}} {{submitted}} to the FIA in Geneva for approval on December 17, 2010. HKS, Inc. and Tilke Engineers & Architects designed the track and Austin Commercial, a subsidiary of Austin Industries, was the general contractor. Construction began on December 31, 2010, and was due to be complete by June 2012. Following a stop-work order in December 2011, the completion date was revised to August. The first tasks were building the silt fences, taking core samples, and shredding existing vegetation.|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{assembly}} lines, where molecules undergo iterative processes involving chain elongation {{and functional}} group manipulation are hallmarks of many processes found in Nature. We {{have sought to}} emulate Nature {{in the development of}} our own molecular assembly line through iterative <b>homologations</b> of boronic esters. Here we report a reagent (α-lithioethyl triispopropylbenzoate) which inserts into carbon-boron bonds with exceptionally high fidelity and stereocontrol. Through repeated iteration we have converted a simple boronic ester into a complex molecule (a carbon chain with ten contiguous methyl groups) with remarkably high precision over its length, its stereochemistry and therefore its shape. Different stereoisomers were targeted and it was found that they adopted different shapes (helical/linear) according to their stereochemistry. This work should now enable scientists to rationally design and create molecules with predictable shape, which could have an impact in all areas of molecular sciences where bespoke molecules are required...|$|R
40|$|Acceptance {{standards}} for roadside safety devices have been operational {{for more than}} 10 years. All the major standards worldwide requests, for the <b>homologations</b> and the installations of these devices, to pass a full scale laboratory crash test. In these years many tests have been done, so {{the large amount of}} data resulting from these activities can be collected and processed with the tools of statistical analysis. This procedure is able to give, using existing data, some hint about the intrinsic rules of this complex phenomena and can be used either in the prediction of unknowns in other crash tests and to evaluate some “strange” results by cross referencing the available data and comparing to the results from statistical regressions. In this paper is presented the database collected and the methodology used to perform the statistical regressions and evaluations, together with the results from this activity on the available databases...|$|R
40|$|Product {{development}} tools have been extensively used {{to accelerate the}} final <b>homologations</b> and release launch with required reliability {{in order to minimize}} risks of damages for society and industry. This work explores a project context for a suspension structural component with high safety requirements in an objective manner, proposing a systematic lean planning approach, considering the value added technical deliverables, using available engineering tools from best architecture definition throughout the detailing design, prototype and testing phases. Aiming an earlier release for final manufacturing tools production compared to traditional development methods, a selection of deliverables from modeling, simulation and testing for technological, manufacturing and economics purposes was conducted to find the main crucial information {{to be part of a}} decision making process that involves a high amount of monetary value. For speeding release, proposals were explored for accessing the structural integrity of a new component considering materials selection, influence of manufacturing in the mechanical properties, characterization and fatigue testing on samples subjected to measured service loads. The methodology was validated with data from similar component evaluation and the reliability for the new product could be proved by dismissing additional on-road durability tests...|$|R
