This resulted in the global average temperature dropping by about [...] As volcanic ash falls out of the atmosphere rapidly, the negative agricultural effects of the eruption were largely immediate and localized to a relatively small area {{in close proximity to}} the eruption, as they were caused by the resulting thick ash cover that resulted. Globally however, despite a several-month 5% drop in overall solar irradiation, and a reduction in direct sunlight by 30%, there was no negative impact to global agriculture. Surprisingly, a 3-4 year increase in global Agricultural productivity and forestry growth was observed, excepting boreal forest regions. The means by which this was discovered, is that initially at the time, a mysterious drop in the rate at which carbon dioxide (CO2) was filling the atmosphere was observed, which is charted in {{what is known as the}} [...] "Keeling Curve". This led numerous scientists to assume that this reduction was due to the lowering of the Earth's temperature, and with that, a slow down in plant and soil respiration, indicating a deleterious impact to global agriculture from the volcanic <b>haze</b> <b>layer.</b> However upon actual investigation, the reduction in the rate at which carbon dioxide filled the atmosphere did not match up with the hypothesis that plant respiration rates had declined. Instead the advantageous anomaly was relatively firmly linked to an unprecedented increase in the growth/net primary production, of global plant life, resulting in the increase of the carbon sink effect of global photosynthesis. The mechanism by which the increase in plant growth was possible, was that the 30% reduction of direct sunlight can also be expressed as an increase or [...] "enhancement" [...] in the amount of diffuse sunlight.

One of the most detailed plans so far is the so-called Titan Mare Explorer (TiME), which had originally been proposed as a separate scout mission, but might eventually be postponed and included in the TSSM.

Due to Titan's <b>haze</b> <b>layer</b> and its distance to the Sun, the lander cannot be powered by solar panels and it would rely on the new Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG), which is a prototype meant to provide availability of long-lived power supplies for landed networks and other planetary missions. The lander will target Ligeia Mare, a northern polar sea of liquid hydrocarbons at about 79°N. The probe will descend by parachute, like the Huygens probe of 2005. During the 6 hours of descent it will analyze the atmosphere and then splashdown on the liquid surface.

40|$|Abstract P 12 A- 04 The Cassini {{observations}} {{reveal the}} presence of a detached <b>haze</b> <b>layer</b> in Titan's mesosphere at an altitude of 520 km, well above the stratosphere. Observations of scattered light made by the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) reveal a clearly defined layer encircling low and mid-latitude regions. The aerosol layer is also detected in stellar occultation measurements of UV extinction by the UltraViolet Imaging Spectrometer (UVIS). The haze is a global and permanent feature of Titan's atmosphere. Furthermore the location of the detached <b>haze</b> <b>layer</b> is coincident with and the likely cause of a local maximum in the temperature profile measured by the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (HASI). This temperature inversion is also permanent and global, having been detected in ground-based stellar occultations. The correlation between the extinction profile and the temperature maximum imply that the detached haze cannot be due to condensation, as previously suggested. Previously, Voyager high phase angle images at 500 nm revealed a detached <b>haze</b> <b>layer</b> near 350 km, more than 150 km lower than the Cassini layer. Close examination of the Voyager images suggests that the Cassini detached layer at 520 km is a separate phenomenon rather than a change in the Voyager detached layer. Analysis of the observed optical properties suggests that the average size of particles in the Cassini detached layer is < 45 nm, with an imaginary index k < 0. 3 at 187. 5 nm, while Non-LTE calculations of the temperature perturbation induced by the detached haze show that the average particle size must be greater than 35 nm for reproducing the heating rate implied by the HASI temperature profile. Calculation of the sedimentation velocity of the particles, coupled with the derived number density, imply a mass flux of 1. 9 - 3. 2 × 10 - 14 g cm- 2 s- 1. This is approximately equal to the mass flux required to explain the main <b>haze</b> <b>layer</b> and suggests that the stratospheric haze is formed primarily by sedimentation and coagulation of particles in the detached layer. This is further supported from the particle size range retrieved for the detached layer (35 - 45 nm), being approximately equal to the radii of ~ 50 nm for the monomers of the aggregate aerosols in the main <b>haze</b> <b>layer.</b> It follows that aerosols on Titan are formed primarily in the thermosphere, rather than the stratosphere as assumed in many pre-Cassini studies. This is consistent with the detection of negatively charged aerosols in the thermosphere by Cassini/CAPS. These conclusions are supported by microphysical aerosol models that couple the detached <b>haze</b> <b>layer</b> and the main <b>haze</b> <b>layer</b> and extend into the thermosphere. Our calculations suggest that the detached <b>haze</b> <b>layer</b> is due to the transition in the growth of particles from spherical shape to aggregates of fractal structure. The rapid increase {{in the size of the}} particles with the onset of fractal growth, in combination with the decrease of their settling velocity, casts them invisible in the transition region. This optical illusion process explains the well-defined and symmetric structure of the detached layer, something difficult to explain under a pure advection scenario. Further investigation of the processes defining the growth of the particles is required in order to understand why the transition takes place at this region and how the particles produced at higher altitudes by high energy radical and ion chemistry, are defining the vertical haze opacity in Titan's atmosphere...|$|E
