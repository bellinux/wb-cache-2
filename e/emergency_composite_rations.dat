50|$|This {{unit was}} formed after the {{reorganization}} from the RASC to the RCT. It is {{descended from the}} Composite companies in 16 Airborne Division and 562 Parachute Coy RASC TA. These units supplied ammunition, fuel, <b>composite</b> <b>rations,</b> fresh meat, bread, and vegetables to the front line. Thus, anyone who was a butcher, baker or greengrocer and could be Para trained would be selected to serve. The Airborne was no different {{except for the fact}} that every thing they needed had to be delivered by air or sourced locally from the indigenous population when on the ground as supplies by road could not be guaranteed.|$|R

5000|$|The UK {{provides}} the Operational Ration Pack, General Purpose. Packed inside a small cardboard box, each ration has enough retort-pouched and canned foods to feed one soldier for 24 hours. [...] Seven menus (plus vegetarian and religious variants) provide two precooked meals (Breakfast and Main Meal) plus a midday snack. Example (Menu A) Breakfast: Hamburger and beans, Instant Porridge. All ration packs also contain Oatmeal Block, Fruit Biscuits, Biscuits Brown (a more compact alternative to bread), a sachet of instant soup and jam or yeast extract (a Marmite like spread) for a lunchtime snack, and chocolate (in {{the form of}} a specially made Yorkie bar which is flatter than civilian bars, or, more recently, a simple unbranded bar of milk chocolate), though this has been phased out with the introduction of the more recent multi-climate ration packs, and boiled sweets (hard candy) for snacking whilst on patrol, or in free time. Main Meal: Instant soup, Chicken with Mushroom and Pasta, Treacle Pudding. Each pack also contains instant coffee, tea bags, creamer, sugar, hot cocoa mix, beef/vegetable stock powder, lemon/orange powder or Lucozade electrolyte powder, matches, packet of tissues, chewing-gum, a small bottle of Tabasco sauce, and water purifying tablets. They sometimes also contain chicken and herb pâté. Also available are Kosher/Halal, Vegetarian, and Hindu/Sikh specific menus. Regardless of their contents, these ration packs are referred to as Rat-Packs or Compo (short for <b>Composite</b> <b>Rations)</b> by the soldiers who eat them. In addition to containing the 24-hour ration, the outside of the cardboard box has a range card printed on its side for use by the soldier to record key features and their range from their position. Other variations designed for specific environments exist.|$|R
40|$|Aim: Present study {{pertains}} to lime treatment of olive meal {{to improve its}} digestibility. The objective {{of the present study}} was to assess the in vitro dry matter degradability of total mixed ration containing lime treated olive meal at varied levels of maize replacement to know the optimum level of lime and treated olive meal as maize replacement in small ruminant diets. Materials and methods: Study was carried out in two phases. In phase I, A complete diet was formulated and treated with lime at variable concentrations (0 - 8 %) at 25 % of maize replacement and subjected to in vitro studies as per Tilley and Terry. On the basis of the results of this phase, a concentration of lime for olive treatment was selected and tested at variable levels of maize replacement (0 - 50 %) by treated olive cake in phase II. Data was analyzed as per the procedures suggested by Snedecor and Cochran. Results: The in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of composite diet increased from 43. 95 % at 0 % lime treatment to 48. 68 % on treating with 8 % lime with significant (P< 0. 05) increase at 6 % treatment level. Lime treatment beyond 6 % had no further significant effect on improving the digestibility. Graded levels of maize replacement by olive meal treated with 6 % lime (lime percentage selected from phase I) showed that the in vitro digestibility of mixed ration was not compromised up to 40 % replacement level of maize by treated olive meal. Improved digestibility with lime treatment may be due to weakening of internal Hydrogen bonding, thereby disrupting the fiber structure in olive meal. Further lime may be saponifying the high level of fat present in olive meal, which may otherwise negatively impact the digestibility values. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the treatment with up to 6 % of lime can effectively increase the digestibility of olive meal. Treated olive meal can replace up to 40 % of maize from daily ration without affecting the digestibility of <b>composite</b> <b>ration.</b> Thus incorporating lime treated olive meal may prove beneficial to livestock producers.

40|$|Recognition and {{management}} of equine pain have been studied extensively in recent decades and {{this has led to}} significant advances. However, there is still room for improvement in the ability to identify and treat pain in horses that have undergone emergency gastrointestinal surgery. This study assessed the validity and clinical application of the composite pain scale (CPS) in horses after <b>emergency</b> gastrointestinal surgery. <b>Composite</b> pain scores were determined every 4 h over 3 days following emergency gastrointestinal surgery in 48 horses. Inter-observer reliability was determined and another composite visceral pain score (numerical rating scale, NRS) was determined simultaneously with CPS scores. CPS scores had higher inter-observer reliability (r= 0. 87, K= 0. 84, P< 0. 001), compared to NRS scores (r= 0. 68, K= 0. 72, P< 0. 001). Horses that survived without complications had significantly lower CPS and NRS scores compared to horses that were euthanased or had to undergo re-laparotomy (P< 0. 001). Breed and the location in the intestinal tract (small or large intestine) did not influence pain scores. In conclusion, the use of the CPS improved objectivity of pain scoring in horses following emergency gastrointestinal surgery. High inter-observer reliability allows for comparisons between different observers. This will be of great benefit in larger veterinary hospitals where several attending clinicians are often involved in the care of each case...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of rumen undegradable protein, could increase supply of amino acids in small intestine to meet host protein requirement. To increase the {{utilization of}} feed protein, feed protein source which is highly degradable should be protected from degradation in the rumen. The objective {{of the study was}} to increase nitrogen retention through substitution of fish meal protein with soy bean meal protected by banana stem juice observed from rumen fermentation activities. The study used 18 late pregnant Sumatera <b>Composite</b> breed ewes. <b>Rations</b> consisted of fresh chopped elephant grass, supplemented with a commercial concentrate and mineral block in the form of Comin plus and different types of protein supplement as treatment diets. The type of protein supplements were: soya bean meal (RK), soy bean meal protected with banana stem juice (RKT) and fish meal (RTI). Treatment diets were offered during late pregnancy (from two months before to two months after partus), two weeks adaptation period was carried out before data recording. Design of the study used randomized complete block design. Results of the study show that rumen ammonia concentration in sheep fed on RKT was not significantly different either from RTI or from RK, however, the nitrogen retention was significantly (P 0. 05), however, proportion of C 2 and nC 4 was significantly different between diet treatment. Methane emission was higher (70. 3 mM or 37. 2 % higher from total energy VFA) in diet RKT which is indicated that fermentation system was not efficient. It can be concluded the higher rumen ammonia concentration and lower nitrogen retention in protected soy bean meal supplement indicated that soy bean meal protected by banana stem juice in the ration was not able to substitute fish meal protein which is resistance from degradation in the rumen...|$|R
40|$|The {{storm surge}} model, Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH), {{is used by}} the National Weather Service (NWS) in {{producing}} storm surge guidance in several ways. SLOSH is run by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to forecast storm surge in real-time when a hurricane is threatening. The model is applied to 38 specific coastal areas, called basins, along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the U. S.; Oahu, Hawaii; Puerto Rico; and the Virgin Islands. SLOSH is also used to create simulation studies to assist in the “hazards analysis ” portion of hurricane evacuation planning by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, and state and local <b>emergency</b> managers. Two <b>composite</b> products, Maximum Envelopes of Water (MEOW) and Maximum of the MEOWs (MOM), are created to provide manageable datasets for planning. The Probabilistic Storm Surge model (P-surge) overcomes the limitations of a single deterministic SLOSH storm surge forecast by being comprised of an ensemble of SLOSH forecasts. The members of the ensemble vary in speed, direction, intensity, and size, based on NHC’s forecast and past errors associated with NHC’s forecasts. P-surge is prompted to run when NHC issues a hurricane watch for the Atlantic or Gulf coasts. The Extratropical storm surge (ET surge) model uses SLOSH to forecast storm surge from extratropcial cyclones. The ET surge model uses surface wind and pressures that are generated by NWS’s Global Forecast System (GFS) model as driving forces...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: High-energy {{trauma of}} the hand often causes tissue loss {{involving}} bone, tendon and skin and is sometimes accompanied by devascularization of digits. Bone stabilization {{is the first step}} in the management of such injuries. Materials and methods: A young patient presented composite tissue loss of the dorsum of his right (dominant) hand following an accident with a surface planer. Tissue loss involved the diaphyses of the first 4 metacarpals, tendons and skin with almost complete amputation of the 3 rd finger. Bone stabilization comprised osteosynthesis using pins associated with cement to fill the bone defect. Hunter tendon rods were used for tendon repair and a pedicle groin flap (McGregor) was used to achieve skin coverage. The cement was replaced with autologous cortico-cancellous bone graft combined with bone paste (Nanostim) 3 months after the cement stabilization. Results: Eleven months after the accident, the patient was able to return to work as a carpenter. Pinch and Grasp strength in the injured hand were half that in the contralateral hand, but there was no loss of sensitivity. Mobility was very satisfactory with a Kapandji score of 9 and a mean TAM of 280 °. The patient can write, open a bottle and does not feel limited for everyday activities. Radiographically, the bone of the 3 reconstructed metacarpals appears consolidated. Conclusion: The induced membrane technique allowed the reconstruction of small bone deficits in the long bones of the hand in a two-step procedure, the first step taking place in an <b>emergency</b> context of <b>composite</b> tissue trauma...|$|R
