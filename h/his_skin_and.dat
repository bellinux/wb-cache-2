5|$|Jackson gave a 90-minute {{interview}} to Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993, his second television interview since 1979. He grimaced when speaking {{of his childhood}} abuse {{at the hands of}} his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached <b>his</b> <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> stated {{for the first time that}} he had vitiligo. Dangerous re-entered the album chart in the top 10, more than a year after its original release.|$|E
5|$|Taraborrelli {{stated that}} Jackson was {{diagnosed}} with lupus, that the vitiligo partially lightened <b>his</b> <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> the lupus was in remission, and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight, which could have caused his lupus condition to recur. Jackson's autopsy did not confirm or refute the claim that he had lupus, but it did confirm that he had vitiligo. His skin {{was found to have}} reduced (though not absent) melanocytes, the cells active in skin pigmentation.|$|E

In his initial appearances, which were drawn by Steve Ditko, the Chameleon had used a device in a belt buckle which emitted a transformation-enhancing gas. The binding element is adjusted to Sage's specific body chemistry.|$|E
25|$|Philip was a 38-year-old {{professional}} man {{referred to}} the author's clinic for assessment....Philip began masturbating at puberty, which occurred at age 12 or 13. The earliest sexual fantasy he could recall was that of having a woman's body. When he masturbated, he would imagine {{that he was a}} nude woman lying alone in her bed. His mental imagery would focus on his breasts, his vagina, the softness of <b>his</b> <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> so on—all the characteristic features of the female physique. This remained his favorite sexual fantasy throughout his life.|$|E
25|$|Quesada {{was at the}} {{controls}} and flew the aircraft over the ocean for calmer air. Fearing that chemical burns from the gasoline might force him to parachute from the airplane to seek medical treatment, Spaatz ordered Eaker to continue the flight regardless. However, Spaatz shed all his clothing and was wiped off with oil-soaked rags. Although he directed at least one refueling without his clothing, replacements were soon delivered. Quesada was briefly overcome by the same accident but quickly revived. Spaatz experienced two other fuel spills without injury, using oil to wipe <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> zinc oxide to protect his eyes.|$|E

25|$|After the movie, {{as seen in}} , Cobra Commander {{is still}} in his snake form and kept as a pet by Serpentor. However, Baroness restores him partly to a semi-human form—through {{exposure}} to an ancient primordial energy called Dragonfire, which {{is the focal point}} of the first five episodes of the new series. The basic shape of his body is humanoid, <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> features are reptilian and he retains a taste for flies that he catches with his prehensile tongue. His intellect is fully restored, and upon being outfitted with his battle armor, Cobra Commander once again appears to be a humanoid male. He regains control of Cobra, and even dispatches Serpentor, using the new found Dragonfire energy to turn him into an oversize iguana. Cobra Commander's inhuman origins are never mentioned again, and he is never shown to have reptilian features again. In Season 2, he resumes wearing his original cloth mask, and his eyes appear to be completely human.|$|E
500|$|The episode details Dr. Otto Octavius as an {{accidental}} laboratory incident {{caused by the}} Green Goblin where the radiation merges special mechanical tentacles to <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was in fact his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs), and turns him from a timid and weak scientist into the villain Dr. Octopus. [...] "Reaction" [...] was directed by Jennifer Coyle {{and was the first}} episode of the series to be written by Randy Jandt. While writing the teleplay, Jandt was challenged with staying true to the original material of Spider-Man, particularly towards that of Dr. Octopus.|$|E
500|$|In Sir Gawain, the Green Knight is {{so called}} because <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> clothes are green. The meaning of his greenness has puzzled {{scholars}} since {{the discovery of}} the poem, who identify him variously as the Green Man, a vegetation being of medieval art; a recollection of a figure from Celtic mythology; a Christian symbol; or the Devil himself. The medieval scholar C. S. Lewis said the character was [...] "as vivid and concrete as any image in literature." [...] J. R. R. Tolkien called him the [...] "most difficult character" [...] to interpret in the introduction to his edition of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. His major role in Arthurian literature includes being a judge and tester of knights, and as such the other characters consider him as friendly but terrifying and somewhat mysterious.|$|E

500|$|Charles J. Shields, {{who wrote}} the first book-length {{biography}} of Harper Lee, offers {{the reason for the}} novel's enduring popularity and impact is that [...] "its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal". [...] Atticus' lesson to Scout that [...] "you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view—until you climb around in <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> walk around in it" [...] exemplifies his compassion. [...] She ponders the comment when listening to Mayella Ewell's testimony. [...] When Mayella reacts with confusion to Atticus' question if she has any friends, Scout offers that she must be lonelier than Boo Radley. [...] Having walked Boo home after he saves their lives, Scout stands on the Radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from Boo's perspective. [...] One writer remarks, [...] "...hile the novel concerns tragedy and injustice, heartache and loss, it also carries with it a strong sense [...] courage, compassion, and an awareness of history to be better human beings." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{skin had}} been a medium-brown color during his youth, but from the mid-1980s {{gradually}} grew paler. The change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors {{that he might have}} been bleaching his skin. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo in 1984; vitiligo results in white patches on the skin. Although Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo, Taraborrelli stated that Jackson had been skin bleaching. He said that Jackson was diagnosed with lupus, and that while the vitiligo partially lightened Jackson's skin, the lupus was in remission. Both illnesses made Jackson's skin sensitive to sunlight. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened <b>his</b> <b>skin,</b> <b>and,</b> with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches he could appear pale. Jackson stated that although he used makeup to control the patchy appearance of his skin, he never purposely bleached his skin. He said of his vitiligo: [...] "It is something I cannot help. When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it." [...] Jackson was also diagnosed with vitiligo in his autopsy, though not lupus.|$|E
500|$|Leaf {{did well}} in the preseason and led the Chargers to victory {{in the first two}} regular-season games. The Chargers won the season opener on September 6, 1998, 16–14 over the Buffalo Bills despite {{mistakes}} from Leaf such as fumbling his first snap and throwing two interceptions; Buffalo penalties voided two would-be interceptions from Leaf. In the game, Leaf's 6-yard touchdown pass to Bryan Still that followed a 67-yard pass to Still gave San Diego a 10–0 lead. However, late in the game, San Diego fell behind 14–13 after a Leaf interception. Leaf completed 16 of 31 passes for 192 yards in the opener and 13 of 24 passes for 179 yards (with 31 rushing yards in 7 carries) in the second game, a 13–7 win over the Tennessee Oilers. [...] In the third game of the season on September 20, Leaf completed only one of 15 passes for four yards, threw two interceptions and fumbled four times (losing three) in a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Thursday before that game, Leaf was hospitalized for a viral infection. Leaf later said that infected turf fibers entered <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> lymph glands.|$|E

500|$|It was {{reported}} that Jordan Chandler claimed that Jackson was circumcised. Jackson's autopsy report reveals {{that he had not}} been circumcised and his foreskin appeared naturally intact and showed no signs of having been restored from a circumcision. Taraborrelli claims that Jordan correctly noted patchy colored skin on his buttocks, short pubic hair, and testicles marked pink and brown; however, initially investigators claimed Chandler said Jackson had splotches on his genitals a color [...] "similar to the color of his face" [...] rather than pink and brown. On February 10, 1993, Jackson had revealed to Oprah that he had a skin disorder that destroyed skin pigmentation and left blotches on <b>his</b> <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> that make-up was used to even out his skin. The live interview was watched by 90 million viewers and after it aired, expert information on vitiligo was widely shared in the media. According to private investigator Anthony Pellicano who questioned Jordan in July 1993 after hearing Evan's taped phone call, Jordan denied that he ever saw Jackson's body but said he did lift his shirt once to show him the blotches on his skin. At the behest of a grand jury, investigators made a probe into Jackson's history, including familial interviews, to see if he had any surgeries or procedures done to alter his body's appearance as the jury felt {{there was a lack of}} a clear match with Jordan Chandler's description.|$|E
500|$|Pryce's Shadow team mate, Jean-Pierre Jarier, out-{{qualified}} him in {{the early}} part of the 1975 season, as the French driver had the new Shadow DN5 car, while Pryce was in the older DN3. It was not until the third round, the South African Grand Prix, that Pryce was able to use a DN5. The team's fourth race of the season was the non-championship Race of Champions held at Brands Hatch. Pryce qualified on pole position and, following a poor start, passed Peterson and Jacky Ickx before closing an eight-second gap to race leader Jody Scheckter, whose engine failed while Pryce harried him, letting Pryce through to become the first Welshman to win a Formula One race. Pryce showed other signs of promise during the season, most notably in Monaco and Silverstone where he qualified on the front row of the grid, the latter being in pole position. Pryce also achieved his first World Championship podium finish, in extremely wet conditions at the Austrian Grand Prix and finished in the points four more times. The highest of those came in Germany where he finished fourth, despite the fact that while he was running second behind Carlos Reutemann fuel had been leaking into the cockpit of his DN5 during the final laps around the very long Nürburgring, reportedly [...] "searing <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> almost blinding him with fumes". The Welshman later received the Prix Rouge et Blanc Jo Siffert award, named after the Swiss Formula One driver, for this achievement.|$|E

He can also lick red-hot iron shovels. According to Shi, since being taken by his parents to the Shaolin Temple, he has never experienced any health problems as he did as an infant, and has never been sick.|$|E
2500|$|Branch Rickey, a 1903 {{graduate}} of Ohio Wesleyan, {{is regarded as}} a significant figure in the history of professional baseball for breaking the sport's racial barrier. An racial incident early in Rickey's life when he was as a baseball coach for Ohio Wesleyan in 1910 would {{play an important role in}} his decision thirty years later. Rickey's team visited a hotel in South Bend, Indiana, where the hotel manager refused to provide a room for Rickey's black baseball player Charley Thomas. Rickey eventually convinced the manager to allow him to share his own room with Thomas. Rickey recalled Thomas rubbing at his hands, ashamed of the color of <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> vowed, [...] "Charley, the day will come when they won't have to be white." [...] In 1943 Rickey became president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Beginning with the 1946 signing of African American player Jackie Robinson for the Dodgers, Rickey became renowned for his role in the racial integration of the game. Rickey's feelings on integration were a primary motivating factor in his decision.|$|E

Of the romance Alderson said her character is [...] "having a great time with Morgan" [...] and her feelings for him are [...] "genuine." [...] However, Morgan's lovedones don't approve of the relationship because of the trouble Kiki causes. A Soapnet promo indicated that Alderson's Kiki could potentially drive a wedge between Morgan and his brother, Michael (Chad Duell) who immediately clashes with Kiki. Alderson later explained that Kiki views Michael as a [...] "challenge" [...] because of his apparent disdain for her. She is accustomed to having men fall at her feet so she pushes Michael's buttons to get under <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> his obvious annoyance intrigues her more. The actress continued, [...] "Kiki kind of loves it when someone loves/hates her!" [...] Michael and Kiki later share a kiss only to learn they are cousins the Quartermaines. Despite the obvious attraction, Michael and Kiki decide to keep their distance from one another and keep quiet about the kiss. Whether intentional or not, Kiki's actions and feelings pit one brother against the other.|$|E
