25|$|Charlie asks Sarah {{what she}} would do if Leslie went away and did not come back. Nancy becomes angry at him for asking. Sarah is upset by the {{question}} and wants {{to go back to the}} sea. Leslie hits and chokes Charlie for making Sarah cry. Leslie and Sarah decide to go back. Nancy tells them to stay because eventually they will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back.</b> Nancy, and to some degree Charlie, offer their help. Leslie accepts their offer.|$|E
25|$|Leslie acts {{most often}} on instinct, like an animal. When birds and jets fly overhead, he runs {{to find an}} escape route. Leslie is very {{protective}} of Sarah. When Charlie hurts Sarah—asking her {{what she would do}} if Leslie left and never came back—Leslie attacks him. After hitting him, Leslie nearly chokes him until the females intercede. After the incident, Leslie decides that he and Sarah will go back into the sea, to escape this threat. When Nancy tells him that they will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> eventually and offers them help, it is Leslie who accepts this fate.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{of the two}} episodes {{occurred}} from September 25, 2015, until October 15, 2015. The Flashs {{episode was}} directed by Ralph Hemecker, and Arrows by Thor Freudenthal. Berlanti discussed the logistic nightmare of bringing the three series together since {{the first couple of}} episodes of Legends of Tomorrow had already been shot before the filming of the crossover episodes. In addition, there were characters from The Flash and Arrow [...] "that we were also shooting out of those respective shows before we went into shooting Legends to then <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and do the introduction of some of the characters here." [...] Falk Hentschel described the filming as [...] "an acting marathon" [...] constantly moving from one set to another during the day, but had a blast.|$|E

500|$|Michael Medved gave Little Miss Sunshine {{four stars}} (out of four) saying that [...] "...this startling and irresistible dark comedy counts {{as one of}} the very best films of the year..." [...] and that {{directors}} Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the movie itself, and actors Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, and Steve Carell deserved Oscar nominations. Joel Siegel issued a rarely awarded 'A' rating, saying that [...] "Orson Welles would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to life for this not to make my year-end Top10 list." [...] Stella Papamichael of BBC News called the film [...] "a winning blend of sophistication and silliness". USA Todays Claudia Puig commented on Breslin's depiction of Olive Hoover, [...] "If Olive had been played by any other little girl, she would not have affected us as mightily as it did." ...|$|E
500|$|Among {{these was}} Bette Davis, {{one of the}} studio's leading stars, who once fled to England to secure release from her contract. In later years, Davis defended Warner against rumors of sexual impropriety when she wrote: [...] "No lecherous boss was he! His sins lay elsewhere. He was the father. [...] The power. The glory. And he was in {{business}} to make money." [...] Davis revealed that, {{after the birth of}} her child, Warner's attitude toward her became warm and protective. [...] "We became father and child, no question about it." [...] she said. [...] "He told me I didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to work until I really felt like it. He was a thoughtful man. Not many nice things were said about him." [...] Warner also earned the gratitude and affection of Errol Flynn. In 1935, the studio head personally selected Flynn for the title role of Captain Blood, even though Flynn was an unknown actor at the time. In 1936, following the success of another costume epic, The Charge of the Light Brigade, Warner tore up Flynn's contract and signed him to a long-term deal that doubled his weekly salary.|$|E
2500|$|Yet at no {{time was}} Dupont's Andalusian {{expedition}} altogether scrapped. Savary continued to issue vague orders promising reinforcements at an undisclosed date while Napoleon fumed {{at the prospect of}} abandoning even Andújar to the Spaniards. With events hanging in the air, Dupont chose to hold his ground along the Guadalquivir, sacking and occupying the town of Bailén and the provincial capital of Jaén, instead of completing his retrograde movement to the strong positions atop the sierra's defiles. Napoleon wrote lightly, [...] "even if he suffers a setback, ...he will just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> over the Sierra." ...|$|E

2500|$|JR and Babe (now {{portrayed by}} Baker) become closer and reunite romantically. JR teams {{up with his}} father, Adam, just like old times. Their goal is to take down Fusion Cosmetics. JR tries to enlist Babe into their scheme. What JR does not know, though, is that Adam is {{secretly}} planning to ruin him in the process. JR and Babe bond, as Adam plans the ultimate takeover. Fusion Cosmetics is at a height of excellence and things are working wonderfully. Babe and JR decide to use [...] "Bella" [...] (a new perfume designed by Babe) to launch her career. They begin to plan their next wedding and decide {{to have a second}} child. Adam has a plan of his own with the assistance of Pete Cortlandt (Daniel Kennedy), who taints the Bella perfume at the launch party. Colby (Brianne Moncrief), JR's sister, gets sick, but no one notices that it is due to the perfume. Greenlee later gets sick, but calls it the flu. When a wedding party arrives at P.V. Hospital, Angie Hubbard says that it is a toxin in Bella that is causing the sickness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then shuts Fusion Cosmetics temporarily down. While Adam is encouraging lawsuits against Fusion, Babe resigns and tells the company to blame the Bella scandal on her. She also admits that she and JR were planning to take over. She has an ulterior motive, as her and JR are planning to move to San Diego anyway. However, they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> when Adam has them subpoenaed to the Bella trial. JR and Babe do not make it to the trial, as they are caught up in a series of tornadoes that strike Pine Valley. Babe sacrifices herself to keep Little Adam from dying, making her internal and external bleeding worse. While in the hospital, she asks JR to marry her. They cannot find a minister as Babe is running out of time before she loses her life, but they exchange vows, regardless, alone in the hospital's chapel. They kiss, declare that they made each other better people and that they love each other from the deepest part of their souls; that their love will never stop, no matter what. After a light hug, Babe dies in JR's arms.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, critics {{focused on}} the {{technique}} of the poem and how {{it relates to the}} meaning. In 1941, G. W. Knight claimed that [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] "needs no defence. It has a barbaric and oriental magnificence that asserts itself with a happy power and authenticity too often absent from visionary poems set within the Christian tradition." [...] Humphrey House, in 1953, praised the poem and said of beginning of the poem: [...] "The whole passage is full of life because the verse has both the needed energy and the needed control. The combination of energy and control in the rhythm and sound is so great" [...] and that Coleridge's words [...] "convey so fully the sense of inexhaustible energy, now falling now rising, but persisting through its own pulse". Also in 1953, Elisabeth Schneider dedicated her book to analysing the various aspects of the poem, including the various sound techniques. When discussing the quality of the poem, she wrote, [...] "I sometimes think we overwork Coleridge's idea of 'the balance or reconciliation of opposite or discordant qualities.' I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to it here, however, for the particular flavor of [...] "Kubla Khan", with its air of mystery, is describable in part through that convenient phrase. Yet, the 'reconciliation' does not quite occur either. It is in fact avoided. What we have instead is the very spirit of 'oscillation' itself." [...] Continuing, she claimed, [...] "The poem is the soul of ambivalence, oscillation's very self; and that is probably its deepest meaning. In creating this effect, form and matter are intricately woven. The irregular and inexact rhymes and varied lengths of the lines play some part. More important is the musical effect in which a smooth, rather swift forward movement is emphasized by the relation of grammatical structure to line and rhyme, yet is impeded and thrown back upon itself even from the beginning". She then concluded: [...] "Here in these interwoven oscillations dwells the magic, the 'dream,' and the air of mysterious meaning of [...] "Kubla Khan". I question whether this effect was all deliberately [...] out by Coleridge, though it might have been. It is possibly half-inherent in his subject ... What remains is the spirit of 'oscillation,' perfectly poeticized, and possibly ironically commemorative of the author." [...] Following in 1959, John Beer described the complex nature of the poem: [...] "'Kubla Khan' the poem is not a meaningless reverie, but a poem so packed with meaning as to render detailed elucidation extremely difficult." [...] In responding to House, Beer claimed, [...] "That there is an image of energy in the fountain may be accepted: but I cannot agree that it is creative energy of the highest type." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Richie's death, Fusion is at {{a height}} of excellence. During this time, Babe and Amanda, who have renewed their friendship, develop a [...] "secret project" [...] which they think Kendall and Greenlee will approve, since Fusion is doing so well. The project {{turns out to be}} a {{fragrance}} designed for working women. Kendall refuses to support it, but Amanda offers to use part of her fortune to finance the fragrance. Kendall insults Babe for the working girl perfume being modeled after her, and this is when Amanda decides to call the perfume [...] "Bella." [...] Kendall and Greenlee let Amanda and Babe do the project on their own, and the perfume has high buzz. Amanda and Babe get into a little argument about which woman should be the promotional figure for Bella, in which Babe and Amanda want themselves on it. They ask Kendall, who could not care less, who then chooses Amanda. Amanda takes it as a compliment before Kendall says how the [...] "slutty" [...] look should appeal. Amanda organizes a launch party which goes well, except for Taylor Thompson killing Randi Morgan's pimp in the bathroom hallway. Things are working wonderfully, and JR and Babe decide to use Bella to launch her career, and they decide they should take over the company. They also begin to plan their next wedding and decide to have a second child. However, Adam has a plan of his own with the assistance of Pete Cortlandt who taints the Bella perfume at the launch party. Colby gets sick, but no one notices that it is due to the perfume.
