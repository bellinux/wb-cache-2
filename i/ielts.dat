40|$|Purpose: To {{find the}} most {{accurate}} mathematical description of the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (<b>IELT)</b> distribution in the general male population. Materials and Methods: We compared the fitness of various well-known mathematical distributions with the <b>IELT</b> distribution of two previously published stopwatch studies of the Caucasian general male population and a stopwatch study of Dutch Caucasian men with lifelong premature ejaculation (PE). The accuracy of fitness is expressed by the Goodness of Fit (GOF). The smaller the GOF, the more accurate is the fitness. Results: The 3 <b>IELT</b> distributions are gamma distributions, but the <b>IELT</b> distribution of lifelong PE is another gamma distribution than the <b>IELT</b> distribution {{of men in the}} general male population. The Lognormal distribution of the gamma distributions most accurately fits the <b>IELT</b> distribution of 965 men in the general population, with a GOF of 0. 057. The Gumbel Max distribution most accurately fits the <b>IELT</b> distribution of 110 men with lifelong PE with a GOF of 0. 179. There are more men with lifelong PE ejaculating within 30 and 60 seconds than can be extrapolated from the probability density curve of the Lognormal <b>IELT</b> distribution of men in the general population. Conclusions: Men with lifelong PE have a distinct <b>IELT</b> distribution, e. g., a Gumbel Max <b>IELT</b> distribution, that can only be retrieved from the general male population Lognormal <b>IELT</b> distribution when thousands of men would participate in a <b>IELT</b> stopwatch study. The mathematical formula of the Lognormal <b>IELT</b> distribution is useful for epidemiological research of the <b>IELT...</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Although {{the use of}} a {{stopwatch}} {{is recommended}} to record intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (<b>IELT)</b> for premature ejaculation, there is no Indian literature which assesses the reliability of this method among our patients. Hence, we assessed the accuracy of stopwatch-measured <b>IELT</b> and compared it with other methods such as number of thrusts and self-assessed <b>IELT</b> in an Indian context. Methods: Between January 2015 and December 2015, couples with premature ejaculation (PE) confirmed with the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool were enrolled in this study. They were asked to report self-assessed <b>IELT</b> for the first 2 weeks, number of thrusts before ejaculation following vaginal penetration for the next 2 weeks, and stopwatch-clocked <b>IELT</b> for the last 2 weeks. At each 2 -week interval, the couples answered erectile/ejaculatory performance anxiety index questionnaire (EPAI). The data were analyzed at the end of 6 weeks. Results: A total of 42 couples with an average married life of 5. 53 years were included in the study. Average stopwatch-clocked <b>IELT</b> was almost 1 min more than the self-reported <b>IELT,</b> which was statistically significant. The average number of thrusts reported was 6. 31. Anxiety on the EPAI scale was maximum while using stopwatch to measure <b>IELT.</b> Conclusion: Use of stopwatch to clock the <b>IELT</b> does not appear to represent true <b>IELT</b> in Indian patients. Self-assessed <b>IELT</b> correlated more accurately with symptoms of PE...|$|R

50|$|Some {{medications}} such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) affect <b>IELT.</b> <b>IELT</b> is {{one factor}} used to diagnose and treat {{conditions such as}} premature ejaculation. <b>IELT</b> may be relevant in perceptions of sexual performance and actual satisfaction, which may also be dependent on many other factors.|$|R
40|$|Background: Although some {{attention}} has been paid to actual and desired duration of foreplay (Denney et al., 1984; Hunt, 1974), prior research investigating actual and desired duration of vaginal and anal intercourse (intravaginal/anal ejaculatory latency time; <b>IELT)</b> is minimal and focused on heterosexual North American perceptions (Miller 2 ̆ 6 Byers, 2004). The current research aimed to assess whether average <b>IELT</b> differed from desired <b>IELT</b> and perceived average man’s <b>IELT</b> based on gender, race, age, sexual orientation, geographical location, and number of sexual partners. Methods: A sample of 9272 individuals: 2551 cisgender women and 6721 cisgender men, average 35 years of age, from six of the seven continents, were recruited for a larger online study of men’s sexual health. Results: There were no significant differences in gender or orientation for average <b>IELT</b> experienced. As age increased, average, desired, and perceived other men’s average <b>IELT</b> decreased. As number of lifetime and past year partners increased, average, desired, and perceived other men’s average <b>IELT</b> increased. Average, desired, and perceived other men’s average <b>IELT</b> was significantly shorter in Asia and among Asian men and women (9. 5 mins avg.) than in all other continents (North America: 12. 4 mins; South America: 14 mins; Europe: 13 mins; Oceania: 13 mins; Africa: 11. 4 mins) and races/ethnicities. Men desired an <b>IELT</b> significantly longer than women (14 mins vs. 16 mins) and perceived the other men’s average to be longer as well (13 mins vs. 14 mins). Desired <b>IELT</b> was shorter among bisexual (14. 5 mins) participants than straight (15. 5 mins) or gay (16 mins) participants. Perceived other men’s average was longest among gay participants (15 mins).

40|$|Introduction: Premature {{ejaculation}} (PE) is {{a common}} male sexual disorder. An ideal, reliable and effective treatment is desired by many men and couples affected by this condition. Aim: Evaluate if the association of a phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitor, tadalafil, and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, can prolong the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (<b>IELT)</b> in men with lifelong premature ejaculation. Methods: Sixty patients with lifelong premature ejaculation and without erectile dysfunction (ED) with <b>IELT</b> less than 90 s {{were enrolled in the}} protocol and randomized into 4 groups to use a combination of medications: (1) tadalafil 20 mg plus fluoxetine 90 mg, (2) fluoxetine 90 mg plus placebo, (3) tadalafil 20 mg plus placebo, and (4) two different placebo capsules (control). Before starting the medications, each man timed his <b>IELT</b> with a stopwatch, and likewise during the treatment period. Fluoxetine 90 mg or placebo was taken once a week plus tadalafil 20 mg or placebo within a 36 - hour frame of intended sexual intercourse with a steady partner. Patients were prospectively followed for 12 weeks. One- way ANOVA was used for statistical comparisons of <b>IELT</b> results in each group. Results: Mean <b>IELT</b> before starting treatment was 51. 3 +/- 23 s. With one- way ANOVA, a statistically significant difference in post- treatment <b>IELT</b> was seen with combination treatment compared to placebo (p < 0. 001). There were increases in <b>IELT</b> from baseline in patients using fluoxetine plus tadalafil (49. 57 +/- 25. 87 to 336. 13 +/- 224. 77) (p < 0. 001), fluoxetine (56. 55 +/- 18. 55 to 233. 62 +/- 105. 08) (p < 0. 001) and tadalafil (49. 26 +/- 19. 43 to 186. 53 +/- 159. 05) (p = 0. 001). The increases in each group were statistically significant compared to the placebo (49. 86 +/- 19. 43 to 67. 82 +/- 46. 18) (p = 0. 042).

40|$|Introduction: Premature {{ejaculation}} (PE) {{is defined}} as ejaculation within 1 minute (lifelong PE) or 3 minutes (acquired PE), inability to delay ejaculation, and negative personal consequences. Management includes behavioral and pharmacologic approaches. Aim: To systematically review effectiveness, safety, and robustness of evidence for complementary and alternative medicine in managing PE. Methods: Nine databases including Medline were searched through September 2015. Randomized controlled trials evaluating complementary and alternative medicine for PE were included. Main Outcome Measures: Studies were included if they reported on intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (<b>IELT)</b> and/or another validated PE measurement. Adverse effects were summarized. Results: Ten randomized controlled trials were included. Two assessed acupuncture, five assessed Chinese herbal medicine, one assessed Ayurvedic herbal medicine, and two assessed topical “severance secret” cream. Risk of bias was unclear in all studies because of unclear allocation concealment or blinding, and only five studies reported stopwatch-measured <b>IELT.</b> Acupuncture slightly increased <b>IELT</b> over placebo in one study (mean difference [MD] = 0. 55 minute, P =. 001). In another study, Ayurvedic herbal medicine slightly increased <b>IELT</b> over placebo (MD = 0. 80 minute, P =. 001). Topical severance secret cream increased <b>IELT</b> over placebo in two studies (MD =  8. 60 minutes, P <. 001), although inclusion criteria were broad (<b>IELT</b> < 3 minutes). Three studies comparing Chinese herbal medicine with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) favored SSRIs (MD = 1. 01 minutes, P =. 02). However, combination treatment with Chinese medicine plus SSRIs improved <b>IELT</b> over SSRIs alone (two studies; MD = 1. 92 minutes, P <. 00001) and over Chinese medicine alone (two studies; MD = 2. 52 minutes, P <. 00001). Adverse effects were not consistently assessed but where reported were generally mild. Conclusion: There is preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, Ayurvedic herbal medicine, and topical severance secret cream in improving <b>IELT</b> and other outcomes. However, results are based on clinically heterogeneous studies of unclear quality. There are sparse data on adverse effects or potential for drug interactions. Further well-conducted randomized controlled trials would be valuable...|$|R

40|$|Background Selective {{serotonin}} reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are {{utilized to}} treat premature ejaculation (PE). However, their effect is moderate, with no universally adopted schedule. A possible role for pelvic floor dysfunction in {{the pathogenesis of}} PE was reported previously. Objective The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the efficacy of combined sertraline and pelvic floor rehabilitation with either line in patients with an unsatisfactory response to SSRIs. Design, setting, and participants From June 2009 to December 2012, 74 PE patients with an unsatisfactory response to sertraline 50 mg were enrolled and subjected to pelvic floor rehabilitation as an alternative therapy, and then a combination of both was tested on the same group. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Relationships with outcome were analyzed using the Student t-test, Pearson′s correlation, and linear regression. Results and limitations The baseline intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (<b>IELT)</b> was 20 - 110 s (mean ± SD = 56. 35 ± 21. 67). With sertraline 50 mg therapy alone, <b>IELT</b> reached 90 - 180 s (mean ± SD = 121. 69 ± 21. 76, P = 0. 0001). Of them, 44 (59. 46 %) patients failed to exceed an <b>IELT</b> of 120 s. With pelvic floor rehabilitation alone, <b>IELT</b> reached 90 - 270 s (mean ± SD = 174. 73 ± 45. 79, P = 0. 0001). Of them, 13 (17. 56 %) patients failed to exceed an <b>IELT</b> of 120 s. Using a combination therapy of both, <b>IELT</b> reached 180 - 420 s (mean ± SD = 297. 57 ± 59. 19, P = 0. 0001). This response was significantly higher than the baseline <b>IELT</b> and that of either lines alone (P = 0. 0001, for all tests). Conclusion Pelvic floor rehabilitation is an important addition when treating PE, particularly in patients with pelvic floor dysfunction. We recommend this combination in patients with an unsatisfactory response to SSRIs. Patient summary Causes of PE differ considerably.

Therefore, between December 2009 and March 2014, a total of 575 circumcised men and 623 uncircumcised men (control group) were evaluated. Detailed evaluations (including circumcision and control groups) on PE were conducted before circumcision and at the 3 -, 6 -, 9 -, and 12 -month follow-up visits after circumcision. Self-estimated intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (<b>IELT),</b> Patient-Reported Outcome measures, and 5 -item version of the International Index of Erectile Function were used to measure the ejaculatory and erectile function for all subjects. The results showed that, during the one-year follow-up, men after circumcision experienced higher <b>IELT</b> and better scores of control over ejaculation, satisfaction with sexual intercourse, and severity of PE than men before circumcision (P< 0. 001 for all). Similarly, when compared with the control group, the circumcised men reported significantly improved <b>IELT,</b> control over ejaculation, and satisfaction with sexual intercourse (P< 0. 001 for all).

Materials and Methods Subjects were recruited to the study from six different urologic centers in the Aegean region. During the enrollment period subjects were recruited in to two group according to presence of premature ejaculation (PE). PE diagnosis was made according to DSM- 4 definition. Subjects and their partners were evaluated with patient reported outcome measures (PRO) related to the ejaculation-based questionnaire (Premature ejaculation patient profile questionnaire -PEPQ). Stopwatch measurements were also asked from each couple to record intravaginal ejaculation latency time (<b>IELT).</b> Couples who completed two clinical visits with 4 wk interval were recruited to the data analysis. Results Among 141 eligible subjects, mean age was 36. 5 ± 9. 7 years and mean partner age was 32. 9 ± 9. 8 years. Following the initial evaluation 80 subjects recruited to group 1 (PE) and 41 subjects recruited to the group 2 (non-PE).

A prospective study was therefore conducted to investigate the DSM-IV definition and to provide an empirical operationalization of premature ejaculation. In this study 140 men suffering from lifelong premature ejaculation were interviewed separately from their partners. Various means of assessing the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (<b>IELT)</b> were compared: assessment by spontaneous answer, by questionnaire, by imagining foreplay and intercourse and estimating the ejaculation time without a clock or with a clock, and by stop-watch measurement at home over a one-month period. The number of thrusts and feelings of control during foreplay and intercourse were also assessed. A total of 110 men used the stop-watch method. Ninety {{percent of all the}} subjects ejaculated within one minute of intromission, with 80 % actually ejaculating within 30 seconds. The age of the men and duration of their relationship were not correlated with IELT; however, the <b>IELT</b> tended to be longer for couples who had a higher frequency of intercourse.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the degree of}} ejaculation delay induced by on-demand treatment with 20 mg paroxetine and 25 mg clomipramine and to assess the type and severity of non-sexual side-effects of treatment at the day of {{and the day after}} treatment with these drugs. Method: A randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose, on-demand study in 30 men with lifelong premature ejaculation was performed. During a 1 -month baseline period and a 4 -week drug treatment period patients assessed the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (<b>IELT)</b> at home with a stopwatch. Only men with an <b>IELT</b> < 1 min were randomly assigned to drug treatment. Patients assessed the drug coitus interval time (DCIT) and used the UKU side effect scale questionnaire at baseline, the day of and the day after intercourse. Results: On-demand treatment with 25 mg clomipramine, with a mean DCIT of 5. 14 h, led to a 4. 05 (95 %CI: 3. 26 - 5. 02) fold-increase of the <b>IELT.</b> On-demand treatment with 20 mg paroxetine, with a mean DCIT of 5. 39 h, led to a 1. 41 (95 %CI: 1. 22 - 1. 63) fold-increase of the <b>IELT.</b> Both drugs had a high incidenc of non-sexual side effects at the coitus day and the next day. At the day of coitus paroxetine led to significant sleepiness and yawning compared to clomipramine. At the day after coitus clomipramine induced significant nausea compared to paroxetine. Conclusion: On-demand treatment with 25 mg clomipramine led to a clinical relevant ejaculation delay. In contrast, 20 mg paroxetine had no clinical relevant ejaculation delay in men with lifelong premature ejaculation with an <b>IELT</b> of less than 1 minute.

40|$|Premature {{ejaculation}} (PE) is {{a common}} male sexual dysfunction. Advances in PE research have been hampered owing to a nonstandardized definition of PE, until the definition by the International Society of Sexual Medicine (ISSM) in 2009. Once the diagnosis of PE is established through a thorough history, a variety of medical therapies is available, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), centrally acting opiates, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors and topical desensitizing creams. Most of these treatments increase the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (<b>IELT)</b> and patient satisfaction scores, with the most convincing evidence for SSRIs and topical creams. Daily SSRIs such as paroxetine, although efficacious, do have a substantial and prolonged side effect profile. Dapoxetine, which is a on-demand SSRI, is the only licensed drug {{for the treatment of}} PE, increasing <b>IELT</b> by a factor of 2. 5 to 3 with limited and tolerable side effects.

40|$|Recently, four {{premature}} ejaculation (PE) subtypes {{have been}} distinguished {{on the basis}} of the duration of the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (<b>IELT).</b> These four PE subtypes have different etiologies and pathogeneses.

Currently, three methods of genetic research on PE have been used. They differ in the investigated population, tool of measurement, study design, and variables of PE. From animal and human research, it is derived that the central serotonergic system "modulates" ejaculation, whereas the ejaculation (reflex) itself is probably not under direct influence of the serotonergic system, but rather under the influence of other neurotransmitter systems in the spinal cord. For genetic research on PE, it is important to take into account that the (serotonergic) modulation of the <b>IELT</b> is variable among men and may even be absent. This means that serotonergic genetic polymorphisms may only be found in men with PE who respond with an ejaculation delay treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor...|$|R

Each patient underwent diagnostic evaluation by one trained psychiatrist, using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR. Each patient was evaluated by researchers to exclude the organic sexual dysfunctions. The patients were randomly assigned in to two groups: group 1 consisting of 42 patients receiving placebo, and group 2 consisting of 43 patients receiving 540 mg herbal vigRX for a 4 -week treatment course. The effects of the drug on the ejaculatory function in each group were assessed by the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (<b>IELT),</b> and the Chinese Index of Premature Ejaculation (CIPE) before {{and at the end}} of the treatment course. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (15 th version).      Results: "nThe mean <b>IELT</b> increased 22. 4 and 32. 0 seconds in the placebo and the vigRX group respectively after the treatment course. The mean <b>IELT</b> differences between the two groups was not significant. The mean CIPE score increased 2. 40 and 4. 37 in the placebo and the vigRX group respectively. The mean CIPE score differences between the two groups was not significant. No side effect was reported by the subjects in neither groups during the treatment course. "nConclusion: Although the improvement in <b>IELT</b> and CIPE scores in the herbal vigRX group was more than the placebo group, this difference was not statistically significant. The increasing of <b>IELT</b> and CIPE score in the placebo group may be due to the placebo effects. Further studies with higher vigRX doses, greater sample size and longer treatment courses are warranted...|$|R
