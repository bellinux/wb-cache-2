5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by an expanse of green lawn, the plan is usually clearly visible at ground level, {{which is not the}} case with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and have been described as resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other late self-portraits, in Self Portrait with Two Circles, Rembrandt, {{with one}} hand on his hip, appears confrontational and even defiant. The <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of a master solemnly asserting his genius.|$|E
25|$|The carving is {{so perfect}} {{that the overall}} <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of {{openwork}} lace. The distinctiveness and richness of the church’s decoration evidence the artistic taste and consummate skill of the craftsmen who created it.|$|E
60|$|I thought so, too. Nevertheless, I went {{softly to}} his room. It <b>was</b> empty. My <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he had distanced the sheriff of Calaveras about two hours.|$|R
25|$|The first {{scientist}} {{to visit the}} site, Uldis Nulle of the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Centre, said his initial <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a meteor impact could have caused the crater.|$|R
60|$|Alban's first <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{she might}} have fainted. He looked closer, and could just see her shadowy figure still seated in the chair. He asked if she was ill. No.|$|R
25|$|The {{practice}} of surface variation {{as a means}} of illusionism--"kenlijkheyt", or perceptibility--was understood by some of Rembrandt's contemporaries. Even so, the dramatic differences between the paint application in the face and passages of the drapery and background are unusual for a late self-portrait. The overall <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of a complete work, one that presents the subject as marked by experience yet ultimately resolute in dignity.|$|E
500|$|Tinro ll {{submersible}} Captain Mikhail Igorevich Girs' diary: Submergence 10 October. Aircraft pieces, wing spars, {{pieces of}} aircraft skin, wiring, and clothing. But—no people.

500|$|Oxford's Bowden was dumbstruck: [...] "I'm really floored. [...] I just haven't got {{any answers}} until I {{talk to the}} crew." [...] His number four, Toby Ayer admitted: [...] "my <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they were quicker than us {{and that is a}} very hard thing to have to say." [...] Cambridge's Williams noted: [...] "I {{thought it would be a}} bit more {{competitive}} than that." [...] Cambridge boat club president Crombie exclaimed [...] "that's the most fun I've ever had rowing for Cambridge." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{poor little}} Nunaga, {{recovering}} from her state of semi-consciousness, opened her eyes, and sat up, her first <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the bear, the wizard, and Kabelaw lay around her dead.|$|R
6000|$|Kirk was on {{his feet}} in one bound. The difference, to a man whose mind is far away, between [...] "Mr. Bannister" [...] and [...] "Miss Bannister" [...] is not great, and his first <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> Ruth who had arrived.|$|R
60|$|Kate's {{very natural}} <b>impression</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> these {{engaging}} individuals had called {{with the view}} of possessing themselves, unlawfully, of any portable articles that chanced to strike their fancy. She {{did not attempt to}} disguise her apprehensions, and made a move towards the door.|$|R
500|$|Greil Marcus {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} disregarding one's initial reading of the song. [...] "The first <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Bob Dylan is setting up the usual private scene: 'I'll sit here and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything James Taylor has ever written". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is {{coming to terms with}} unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because [...] "the time has passed when people are interested in hearing Bob Dylan say he'll just sit there and watch the river flow... even though that's not quite what he's saying". For Marcus, [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is a compelling work, but the subtlety of the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience.|$|E
500|$|The {{relative}} importance given {{to each of}} these three strategies has varied over time and between different contexts. The general impression in the current Churches of Christ is that the group's hermeneutics are entirely based on the command, example, inference approach. [...] In practice, interpretation has been deductive, and heavily influenced by the group's central commitment to ecclesiology and soteriology. [...] Inductive reasoning has been used as well, as when all of the conversion accounts from the book of Acts are collated and analyzed to determine the steps necessary for salvation. [...] One student of the movement summarized the traditional approach this way: [...] "In most of their theologizing, however, my <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> spokespersons in the Churches of Christ reason from Scripture in a deductive manner, arguing from one premise or hypothesis to another so as to arrive at a conclusion. In this regard the approach is much like that of science which, in practice moves deductively from one hypothesis to another, rather than in a Baconian inductive manner." [...] In recent years, changes in the degree of emphasis placed on ecclesiology and soteriology has spurred a reexamination of the traditional hermeneutics among some associated with the Churches of Christ.|$|E
500|$|Harkins resented his {{decreasing}} relevance, {{especially as}} his term in Vietnam {{would be over}} in six months anyway, {{so he decided to}} try to regain influence lost to Lodge by altering the shape of the Saigon regime. The split between Harkins and Lodge was also kept unresolved by domestic political imperatives in Washington. The Defense Department would not drop their support for Harkins, so he was not recalled early. Although Johnson said of Lodge [...] "He ain't worth a damn. He can't work with anybody. He won't let anybody else work", the president chose not to try to force any changes due to the upcoming US Presidential election. Lodge was the front-runner for the Republican nomination at the time, and Johnson wanted to keep him in Saigon rather than having the ambassador in the US campaigning against him and the Democratic Party. Aside from Harkins, General Maxwell Taylor, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was also known to regard Khánh as the nation's foremost general, while Undersecretary of State George Ball told Lodge that [...] "Our [...] <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Khánh {{is one of the best}} of the generals, both courageous and sophisticated." [...] Khánh was known for his pro-American views, and Lodge's aide, Colonel Mike Dunn said that Khánh was not only a fluent speaker of English, but [...] "he spoke American; American Army in fact." [...] On one occasion Khánh had told American officials that South Vietnam [...] "must rely on American support".|$|E
5000|$|Samuel Rheen, who was {{a priest}} in Kvikkjokk 1664-1671, {{was one of the}} first to write about Sami religion. His <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> many Sami, but not all, used the drum for divination. Rheen {{mentioned}} four matters in which the drum could give answers: ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Brass's first <b>impression</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> {{his host}} <b>was</b> gone and {{had left him}} there alone--perhaps locked him in for the night. A strong smell of tobacco, however, {{suggested}} a new train of ideas, he looked upward, and saw <b>that</b> the dwarf <b>was</b> smoking in his hammock.|$|R
5000|$|McCaig {{chose to}} {{disregard}} the novel Scarlett by Alexandra Ripley. He does not acknowledge its existence in the canon of Gone with the Wind, nor does his novel incorporate any of its characters. McCaig's <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Margaret Mitchell estate was [...] "thoroughly embarrassed" [...] by Ripley's novel.|$|R
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{raises questions}} about the range to which copyright law can extend. Alex Chapman of Campbell Hooper solicitors, stated [...] "The Church will have an uphill battle in a legal claim against Sony, and indeed it is likely that there is no basis for a claim." [...] He cited a provision in the UK's 1988 Copyright Designs and Patents act that [...] "explicitly states that it is not copyright infringement to represent certain artistic works that are on public display". This includes sculptures and buildings which are [...] "permanently situated in a public place or in premises open to the public". Chapman also pointed out that, in the UK, copyright expires 70 years after the person who created the work dies. He went on to say, [...] "What all this means is that public buildings are generally fair game for inclusion in video games, films et cetera, and it is something that their owners just have to accept. What isn't fair game, however, is if the building is presented in a way that could be said to be defamatory in relation to those associated with it and this might be what the Church is more concerned about. Also if the representation of the building could be argued to have become so closely associated with a business that its representation amounts to a false endorsement of Sony or its products, or it is registered as a trademark, there may be issues. In each case however my <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Church will have some difficulty in pursuing Sony. There is no law against insensitivity and as with many matters of this kind, it is the public reaction that might be more damaging than the legal one." [...] An unofficial review, by lawyers at Freeth Cartwright, of the rights that Sony might have infringed concluded that the Church of England did not have a case on either copyright or passing off grounds.|$|E

40|$|Inflammation of the pleura with {{or without}} {{effusion}} is a common disease. The aetiological diagnosis of effusion is of paramount impor-tance. Needle or open biopsy of the pleura offers the rmans for aetiological diagnosis. Laggat (1959) used Vim-Silverman’s needle for percutaneous pleural biopsy in 22 cases. Overall <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the specimen <b>was</b> not satis-factory. Pollar (1958) performed percutaneous pleural biopsy and obtained 228 specimens from 200 patients. He established the diagnosis in 80 % of the tuberculous and 60 % of the malig-nant effusions and his <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> this <b>is</b> the most reliable diagnostic technique when effusion of a tuberculous nature is suspected. The present paper reports 81 cases of pulmonary lesions with pleural involvement who underwent pleural biopsy by Abrams punch or open pleural biopsy in selected cases...|$|R

2500|$|During the Classical Ottoman period (1300–1600), the Jews, {{together}} with most other {{communities of the}} empire, enjoyed {{a certain level of}} prosperity. Compared with other Ottoman subjects, they were the predominant power in commerce and trade as well in diplomacy and other high offices. In the 16th century especially, the Jews rose to prominence under the millets, the apogee of Jewish influence could arguable be the appointment of Joseph Nasi to Sanjak-bey (governor, a rank usually only bestowed upon Muslims) of the island of Naxos. Also {{in the first half of}} the 17th century the Jews were distinct in winning Tax farms, Haim Gerber describes it as: [...] "My <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no pressure existed, that it was merely performαnce that counted." ...|$|E
2500|$|WikiIslam was {{the subject}} of an article in the 7/2007 issue of the journal Contemporary Islam, {{entitled}} [...] "Cyber-Islamophobia? The case of WikiIslam", which argues that the website commits selection bias by collecting only negative or critical material. The article states that [...] "In relation to the criteria set up by the Runnymede Trust ... it should be quite easy to label most of the material published on WikiIslam as expressions of Islamophobia." [...] Göran Larsson adds that [...] "y <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the stories reported by WikiIslam have merely been selected to show that Muslims are ignorant, backward or even stupid." [...] Because of the presence of material obtained from other websites, such as MEMRI, the article notes that [...] "it becomes much more difficult to argue that all information posted on WikiIslam is Islamophobic by nature".|$|E
2500|$|Also {{characteristic}} of the Victorian era was the rebuilding or restoration of the area's ancient churches. [...] Richard Cromwell Carpenter rebuilt St Nicholas' Church from a ruined state in 1853–54, and Somers Clarke did more work in 1876. George Basevi carried out an [...] "uninspiring" [...] neo-Norman revamp of the 13th-century St Andrew's Church in the 1830s, James Woodman and Ewan Christian [...] "over-restored" [...] St Peter's Church at Preston Village in 1872 and 1878, and the 11th- and 12th-century St Peter's Church at West Blatchington was initially rebuilt by Somers Clarke in 1888–91 and comprehensively extended in 1960 in a complementary style by John Leopold Denman. The partly Saxon St Wulfran's Church, Ovingdean (the city's oldest building) was altered in the 1860s, although the overwhelming <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of a 12th-century Downland village church; and similar work was carried out at St Helen's Church in Hangleton in the 1870s, which nevertheless [...] "retains its medieval character".|$|E
60|$|Guy's first <b>impression</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> {{the last}} person to mention it to Mrs. Henley; but when he remembered how often her brother was at Hollywell, he {{perceived}} <b>that</b> there might <b>be</b> a train for carrying the report back again to her, and recognized the absolute necessity of silence.|$|R
60|$|Miss Headworth was {{accustomed}} to receive visitors anent boarders, so when Lady Kirkaldy's card was brought to her, the first <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> some such arrangement was to be made.

2500|$|He {{describes}} it, {{near the}} Big Falls, about one {{hundred yards from}} the top of the mountain at Loup Creek, [...] "When I first saw it, fifty-eight years ago, it was in a much better state of preservation than it now is. At that time a large portion of it was standing fully six or seven feet high, and was well built. Its thickness was about two feet at the base, and slightly tapered towards the top. There were a number of gates, or openings, in the wall, that are quite perceptible even at this time. They were, however, very plainly perceivable a half century ago. From the number of stones promiscuously scattered in the vicinity of the wall, my <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was originally greater than seven or even eight feet in height." [...] This wall was nearly three and a half miles long. Some have surmised it was nearly 10 miles long in total, having short branching elements also connected. Parts of these walls were damaged during the 20th century.|$|E
