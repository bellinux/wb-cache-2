5|$|Because of <b>its</b> <b>significance</b> for {{planetary}} cores, {{the physical}} properties of iron at high pressures and temperatures {{have also been}} studied extensively.

5|$|Because of <b>its</b> <b>significance,</b> Diary of a Camper {{continues}} to be featured in machinima presentations. It {{was one of the}} first works to be included in the Machinima Archive, a collaboration among Stanford University, the Internet Archive, the AMAS, and machinima.com. In a 2005 event at Stanford University, the film was presented with later machinima works, such as Red vs. Blue. Likewise, the Australian Centre for the Moving Image included it in a 2006 machinima exhibit.|$|E
5|$|Considerable non-printed {{material}} in the Deseret alphabet was made, including a replica headstone in Cedar City, Utah, some coinage, letters, diaries, and meeting minutes. One of the more curious items found in the Deseret alphabet is an English-Hopi dictionary prepared by two Mormon missionaries. It sat unappreciated in handwritten form at the LDS Church Archives until 2014, when Kenneth R. Beesley, a writing system researcher and computer scientist, noticed <b>its</b> <b>significance</b> and transcribed it into standard written English.|$|E

5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read the letters (he only says {{that he has}} {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors. Whatever the case, the wording of the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of <b>its</b> <b>significance.</b> Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.|$|E
5|$|The Inca {{followed}} both {{solar and}} lunar cycles throughout the year. The {{cycle of the}} moon was of primary importance for the timing of both agricultural activities and associated festivals.

This records that:King Constantine and Bishop Cellach met at the Hill of Belief near the royal city of Scone and pledged themselves that the laws and disciplines of the faith, {{and the laws of}} churches and gospels, should be kept pariter cum Scottis.

5|$|When steamboats were {{superseded}} by the railroad, the river {{lost much of}} <b>its</b> <b>significance</b> to the state. The influx of immigrants to Florida settled primarily south of Orlando, adversely affecting {{the natural order of}} wetlands there. Within the past 50 years, however, urban areas in the northern and central parts of the state have grown considerably. In the upper basin, population increased by 700 percent between 1950 and 2000, and is expected to rise another 1.5 million by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Janet's {{landfall}} as a Category5 hurricane on the Yucatán Peninsula was {{the first}} recorded instance that a storm of such intensity in the Atlantic made landfall on a continental mainland; prior to Janet, landfalls of Category5 intensity were only known {{to have taken place}} on islands. Janet's minimum barometric pressure, recorded in Chetumal, was at the time the second lowest recorded pressure on land associated with a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic, behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane. At least 1,023deaths were attributed to Hurricane Janet, as well as $65.8million in damages. The name Janet was later retired from the Atlantic list of tropical cyclone names due to <b>its</b> <b>significance</b> to the scientific research community.|$|E

5|$|Located {{near the}} Principality's capital of Andravida {{and the chief}} port of Glarentza, Chlemoutsi {{played a central role}} in the Principality's history, but was never {{actually}} besieged. After coming under Byzantine rule in 1427, it was captured in 1460 by the Ottoman Empire, along with the rest of the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea. In Ottoman times, minor additions were made to provide platforms for artillery, but the castle progressively lost <b>its</b> <b>significance</b> and was completely deserted by the late 18th century. In 1825, during the Greek War of Independence, part of its outer wall was demolished to prevent the Greek rebels from using it. Today it is a preserved monument open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke) is {{examining}} evidence relating to Johnston's murder; she discovers that Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) had suppressed infrared post-mortem photographs. Learning of this, the Elder (Philip Baker Hall)—a high-ranking Group official—demands an explanation; Watts divulges that the murdered {{man had been}} conspiring to pit conflicting faction within the Group against each other. Watts had found evidence {{in one of the}} photographs which may have influenced such a schism and wished to keep it hidden until <b>its</b> <b>significance</b> could be known. The Elder agrees, and similarly decides to hold off on testing which would reveal if an artefact in Johnston's possession was an authentic piece of the True Cross.|$|E
5|$|Since Arafat {{was raised}} in Cairo, the {{tradition}} of dropping the Mohammed or Ahmad portion of one's first name was common; notable Egyptians such as Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak did so. However, Arafat dropped Abdel Rahman and Abdel Raouf from his name as well. During the early 1950s, Arafat adopted the name Yasser, {{and in the early}} years of Arafat's guerrilla career, he assumed the nom de guerre of Abu Ammar. Both names are related to Ammar ibn Yasir, one of Muhammad's early companions. Although he dropped most of his inherited names, he retained Arafat due to <b>its</b> <b>significance</b> in Islam.|$|E

5|$|The Marysville and Tulalip {{area have}} several {{properties}} {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The Marysville Opera House was built by the Independent Order of Oddfellows in 1911 {{at a cost of}} $20,000; it would later be listed in 1982 and renovated in 2003 for use by city events. On the Tulalip reservation, the Indian Shaker Church and St. Anne's Roman Catholic Church were built in the early 20th century and listed on the register in 1976; the Tulalip Indian Agency Office, built in 1912, was listed for <b>its</b> <b>significance</b> in tribal affairs as well as the town's founding. Another historic landmark in the area, not listed on the register, is the Gehl House at Jennings Park, a pioneer-era wooden cabin built in 1889 and restored with original furnishings.|$|E
5|$|The book {{discusses}} related legal {{practices of}} countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany. Israel {{was the first}} country to publicly acknowledge the practice—in November 2000. The author connects this policy initiative with Israel's ongoing conflict with Palestinian militants. Melzer argues that this policy was controversial—the issue came before the Israeli Supreme Court, where the matter was not decided for almost five years. The court's judgment was issued on 14 December 2006, but neither forbade nor endorsed the practice. Melzer asserts that it left multiple important legal conundra unresolved. <b>Its</b> <b>significance</b> was that it dealt not with a single incident, but rather {{with the nature of}} the policy itself and set forth conditions for examining the legality of future episodes.|$|E
5|$|The fort {{remained}} as headquarters of South Australia's permanent military force until the 1890s and {{as late as}} 1895 there were still plans to upgrade the 64-pounder armament, though without result. By 1901 the fort was manned on a caretaker basis only and no permanent forces were stationed. The Federal Government assumed responsibility for South Australian defence in 1903 and took over the fort. Though Glanville by then had no significant defence role, the state received £14,739 in compensation. From that point <b>its</b> <b>significance</b> was not defence related but as the first and best preserved 19th-century fortification in South Australia.|$|E
