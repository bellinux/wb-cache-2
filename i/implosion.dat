5|$|By July 1944, Oppenheimer had {{concluded}} that plutonium {{could not be used}} in a gun design, and opted for <b>implosion.</b> The accelerated effort on an <b>implosion</b> design, codenamed Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on <b>implosion.</b> Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the <b>implosion</b> weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher. Although Teller was head of the T-1 (<b>Implosion</b> and Super) Group, Bethe considered that Teller was spending too much time on the Super, which had been given a low priority by Bethe and Oppenheimer. In June 1944, Oppenheimer created a dedicated Super Group under Teller, who was made directly responsible to Oppenheimer, and Peierls became head of the T-1 (<b>Implosion)</b> Group. In September, Teller's group became the F-1 (Super and General Theory) Group, part of the Enrico Fermi's new F (Fermi) Division.|$|E

A trend of decreasing yields relative to the predictions of 2 D draco hydrodynamics simulations with increasing Knudsen number (the ratio of ion-ion mean free path to minimum shell radius) suggests that ion kinetic effects are increasingly impacting the hot fuel region, in general agreement with previous results.

5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized in August 1944 to {{concentrate}} on creating an implosion-type nuclear weapon. Studying <b>implosion</b> on a large scale, or even a full scale, required special diagnostic methods. As early as November 1943, Kerst suggested using a betatron employing 20 MeV gamma rays instead of x-rays to study <b>implosion.</b> In the August 1944 reorganization, he became joint head, with Seth Neddermeyer, of the G-5 Group, part of Robert Bacher's G (Gadget) Division specifically charged with betatron testing. Oppenheimer had the 20 MeV betatron at the University of Illinois shipped to Los Alamos, where it arrived in December. On January 15, 1945, the G-5 Group took their first betatron pictures of an <b>implosion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though many {{remained}} unimpressed, Oppenheimer appointed Neddermeyer {{the head}} of a new group to test <b>implosion.</b> His group became the E-5 (<b>Implosion)</b> Group, which was part of Captain William S. Parsons' E Division. A gun-type nuclear weapon was the preferred method, but <b>implosion</b> research constituted a backup. Neddermeyer embarked on an intensive series of experiments testing cylindrical implosions. The result was a series of distorted shapes. Progress was made; Neddermeyer and a member of his team, Hugh Bradner, along with James L. Tuck from the British Mission, conceived the idea of explosive lenses, in which shaped charges are used to focus the force of an explosion. Nevertheless, seemingly unsolvable problems with shock wave uniformity brought progress on <b>implosion</b> to a crawl.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, {{tests on}} the first sample of {{plutonium}} that had been produced with neutrons in a nuclear reactor revealed that reactor-bred plutonium contained five times more plutonium-240 than that hitherto produced in a cyclotrons. This unwanted isotope that spontaneously decayed and produced neutrons promised to cause a predetonation without sufficiently quick critical mass assembly. It now became apparent that only <b>implosion</b> would work for practical plutonium bombs; a powerful enough gun could not be constructed small enough to be carried in an aircraft, and plutonium-240 was {{even more difficult to}} separate from plutonium-239 than the isotopes of uranium that were giving the rest of the Manhattan Project such difficulties. Plutonium was unusable unless <b>implosion</b> worked, but only plutonium could be produced in quantities that would allow regular production of atomic bombs. Thus, the <b>implosion</b> technique now suddenly stood as the key to production of nuclear weapons.|$|E

40|$|Studies of ion kinetic effects {{during the}} shock-convergence phase of {{inertial}} confinement fusion (ICF) <b>implosions</b> and magnetic reconnection in strongly-driven, laser-produced plasmas have been {{facilitated by the}} use of shock-driven ICF <b>implosions</b> and diagnosed using both mature and newly-developed nuclear diagnostics. Ion kinetic effects that are likely to be significant early in ICF <b>implosions,</b> as strong shocks create a high-temperature, moderate-density plasma with an ion mean free path approximately the size of the fuel region, have, for the first time, been explored in a comprehensive experimental campaign. These experiments at the OMEGA laser facility, in which the ion mean free path was systematically varied in a series of shock-driven <b>implosions,</b> have demonstrated that measured fusion yields are increasingly discrepant relative to the predictions of hydrodynamic codes with increasing ion mean free path. The enhanced transport of fuel ions out of the hot plasma region and the reduction in fusion reactivity due to the depletion of high-energy tail ions are responsible. These effects have also been inferred in shock-driven <b>implosions</b> at the National Ignition Facility. The universal plasma phenomenon of magnetic reconnection has been explored in strongly-driven, high-[beta] laser-produced plasmas, driving reconnection in a regime relevant to astrophysical environments, such as the Earth's magneto-pause. Using shock-driven ICF <b>implosions</b> as a proton source to probe magnetic fields, the first systematic laboratory experiments to study asymmetric magnetic reconnection have been conducted. These experiments have shown that the rate of reconnection in this strongly flow-driven system is dictated by the flow velocity and is largely insensitive to initial asymmetries in density, ram pressure, and geometry. Related experiments have probed the collision of parallel magnetic fields to assess the effect of strong flows on magnetic fields in the absence of reconnection. Experiments using high-resolution proton radiography have revealed small-scale electron jets that demonstrate the importance of two-fluid effects in permitting a fast reconnection even when reconnection is driven by strong plasma flows. This work has improved understanding and spurred further experimental and theoretical inquiry into kinetic ion behavior in ICF <b>implosions</b> and magnetic reconnection in regimes rarely accessed in the laboratory. by Michael Jonathan Rosenberg.

40|$|Bayesian {{networks}} (BN) are {{an excellent}} tool for modeling uncertainties in systems with several interdependent variables. A BN is a directed acyclic graph, and consists of a structure, or the set of directional links between variables that depend on other variables, and conditional probabilities (CP) for each variable. In this project, we apply BN's to understand uncertainties in NIF ignition experiments. One can represent various physical properties of National Ignition Facility (NIF) capsule <b>implosions</b> as variables in a BN. A dataset containing simulations of NIF capsule <b>implosions</b> was provided. The dataset was generated from a radiation hydrodynamics code, and it contained 120 simulations of 16 variables. Relevant knowledge about the physics of NIF capsule <b>implosions</b> and greedy search algorithms were used to search for hypothetical structures for a BN.

However, we thought {{there should have been}} more links between the dataset variables based on the physics of NIF capsule <b>implosions.</b> Important reasons for the paucity of links are the relatively small size of the dataset, and the sampling of the values for dataset variables. Another factor that might have caused the paucity of links is {{the fact that in the}} dataset, 20 % of the simulations represented successful fusion, and 80 % didn't, (simulations of unsuccessful fusion are useful for measuring certain diagnostics) which skewed the distributions of several variables, and possibly reduced the number of links.

5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as <b>implosion,</b> had begun by Neddermeyer's E-5 (<b>Implosion)</b> group. Serber and Tolman had conceived <b>implosion</b> during the April 1943 conferences {{as a means}} of assembling pieces of fissionable material together to form a critical mass. Neddermeyer took a different tack, attempting to crush a hollow cylinder into a solid bar. The idea was to use explosives to crush a subcritical amount of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and they form a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. At the time, the idea of using explosives in this manner was quite novel. To facilitate the work, a small plant was established at the Anchor Ranch for casting explosive shapes.|$|E

In September 1943, John von Neumann, who had experience with shaped charges used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would <b>implosion</b> reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the fissionable material.
