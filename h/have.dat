5|$|Several {{groups of}} temnospondyls <b>have</b> large bony plates on their backs. One temnospondyl, Peltobatrachus, has armour-like plating that covers both its back and underside. The temnospondyl Laidleria also has {{extensive}} plating on its back. Most {{members of the}} family Dissorophidae also <b>have</b> armor, although it only covers the midline of the back with two narrow rows of plates. Other temnospondyls, such as Eryops, <b>have</b> been found with small, disc-like bony scutes that were in life probably embedded in the skin. All of these temnospondyls were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle. Armor may <b>have</b> offered protection from predators in the case of Peltobatrachus. The scutes may <b>have</b> provided stability for the spine, as they would <b>have</b> limited flexibility and may <b>have</b> been connected by strong ligaments. Temnospondyls, such as Sclerothorax and Eryops, that may <b>have</b> been at least partly terrestrial also <b>have</b> long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would <b>have</b> stabilized the spine. Bony scutes are also seen in plagiosaurs, but unlike Peltobatrachus, Laidleria, Eryops, and dissorophids, these animals are thought to <b>have</b> been fully aquatic. Plagiosaurs may <b>have</b> inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor, as both Peltobatrachus and Laidleria <b>have</b> been considered close relatives of the group.|$|E

5|$|Ankylosaurus is {{a member}} of the family Ankylosauridae, and its closest {{relatives}} appear to be Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus. Ankylosaurus is thought to <b>have</b> been a slow moving animal, able to make quick movements when necessary. Its broad muzzle indicates it was a non-selective browser. Sinuses and nasal chambers in the snout may <b>have</b> been for heat and water balance, or may <b>have</b> played a role in vocalization. The tail club is thought to <b>have</b> been used in defense against predators or in intraspecific combat. Ankylosaurus has been found in the Hell Creek, Lance, and Scollard formations, but appears to <b>have</b> been rare in its environment. Although it lived alongside a nodosaurid ankylosaur, their ranges and ecological niches do not appear to <b>have</b> overlapped, and Ankylosaurus may <b>have</b> inhabited upland areas.
