40|$|ABSTRACT: Filament winding is an {{efficient}} process for manufacturing composite pressure vessels that {{take advantage of}} the high structural efficiency of graphite fiber. One critical parameter in evaluating the performance of composite pressure vessels is burst strength. Burst failure in such vessels is primarily a result of fiber breakage. Once fibers start to break, the role of the matrix material becomes increasingly important. The major objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of preselected epoxy matrix proper-ties on delivered fiber strength and strength variability. It is shown that important matrix variables in determining delivered fiber strength and strength variability are the neat resin fracture toughness* * (GIc); <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>yield</b> (&epsilon;y); initial modulus (Eo); and strength yield (&sigma;ys).

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} irradiation dose, crosslinker concentration, graft level or styrene/DVB content on the tensile strength, <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break, <b>yield</b> strength and modulus of elasticity, of poly(ethylene-alt-tetrafluoroethylene) (ETFE) based membranes. Grafted films were prepared by radiation-induced grafting and the membranes were obtained by subsequent sulfonation of the grafted films. It {{was found that the}} <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break decreases considerably beyond an irradiation dose of 50 kGy and tensile strength decreases gradually with dose. It was shown that the <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break decreases with increasing both the crosslinker concentration and graft level. However, tensile strength was positively affected by the crosslinker concentration. Yield strength and initial modulus of elasticity are almost unaffected by the introduction of crosslinker. On the other hand, yield strength and modulus of elasticity increases progressively with graft level. The <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break of the optimized membrane (graft level of ~ 25 %, 5 % DVB (v/v)) obtained at lower irradiation dose (1. 5 kGy) shows a pronounced decreases of ~ 56 % of its initial value after the grafting and sulfonation steps whereas the tensile strength was mostly affected by the sulfonation step.

However this technique is still facing substantial problems to produce porous structure having sufficient mechanical strength. In this present research an exertion has been made to develop a bio-compatible FDM filament which has been further used to fabricate 3 D porous structure. The results of the study highlighted the effect of FDM process parameters (infill percentage, infill speed and layer thickness) on the tensile properties (percentage <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> peak, percentage <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break and <b>yield</b> stress) of the 3 D functional prototypes. It has been observed that infill percentage has major contribution i. e. 92 % towards peak elongation, 91 % towards break elongation and 80 % towards yield stress.

Although most materials used to make prosthetic sockets {{have been used for}} many years, knowledge of these materials' properties is limited, especially after they are subjected to fabrication processes. This study evaluated tensile and impact properties of the current state-of-the-art materials used to fabricate prosthetic check sockets, copolymer sockets, and definitive laminated sockets. Thermolyn Rigid and Orfitrans Stiff check socket materials produced significantly lower tensile strength and impact resistance than polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG). Copolymer socket materials exhibited greater resistance to impact forces than the check socket materials but lower tensile strengths than PETG. The heated molding processes, for the check socket and copolymer materials, reduced both tensile strength and elongation at break. Definitive laminated sockets were sorted according to fabrication techniques. Nyglass material had significantly higher elongation, indicating a more ductile material than carbon-based laminations. Carbon sockets with pigmented resin had higher tensile strength and modulus at break than nonpigmented carbon sockets. <b>Elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>yield</b> and elongation at break were similar for both types of carbon-based laminations.

In this study, boron production waste clay (CW) was used as filler to produce a geosynthetic barrier with bentonite, waste tire, and bitumen. Bentonite and waste tires were used as auxiliary fillers and bitumen as the binder. CW/bitumen, CW/bentonite/bitumen, and CW/waste tire/bitumen mixtures were prepared by using a laboratory mixer at 100 °C. Hot mixtures were extruded into strips by using a lab-scale corotating twin screw extruder (L/D: 40) followed by die casting (2 [*]mm × 100 [*]mm).

30|$|During {{design and}} winding of superconducting magnets at room temperature, a {{pre-tension}} under different rate is always applied {{to improve the}} mechanical stability of the magnets. However, an inconsistency rises for superconductors usually being sensitive to strain and oversized pre-stress which results in degradation of the superconducting composites’ critical performance at low temperature. The present study focused {{on the effects of}} the cold-treatment and strain-rate of tension deformation on mechanical properties of NbTi/Cu superconducting composite wires. The samples were immersed in a liquid nitrogen (LN 2) cryostat for the adiabatic cold-treatment, respectively with 18 -hour, 20 -hour, 22 -hour and 24 -hour. A universal testing machine was utilized for tension tests of the NbTi/Cu superconducting composite wires at room temperature; a small-scale extensometer was used to measure strain of samples with variable strain-rate. The strength, <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> fracture and <b>yield</b> strength of pre-cold-treatment NbTi/Cu composite wires were drawn. It was shown that, the mechanical properties of the superconducting wires are linearly dependent on the holding time of cold-treatment at lower tensile strain-rate, while they exhibit notable nonlinear features at higher strain-rate. The cold-treatment in advance and the strain-rate of pre-tension demonstrate remarkable influences on the mechanical property of the superconducting composite wires.|$|R

The optical, thermal, and mechanical {{properties of the}} composites were measured. Nanocomposite films of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with C 60 (OH) 36 were prepared as a reference to show how improved dispersion of the nanofiller affects the overall transparency of the composites. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy showed that the addition of hydroxylated fullerenes did not affect visible light transmit-tance of the films significantly {{in the range of}} 400 – 800 nm. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo–gravi-metric analysis (TGA) measurements showed the increased thermal stability of PC/C 60 (OH) 12 film as compared to pristine PC film. This phenomenon was explained by the rigid polymer interphase regions formed around C 60 (OH) 12 due to the plausible hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction. On the other hand, the lower thermal stability of PC– C 60 (OH) 36 was assumed to be caused by large agglomeration of the C 60 (OH) 36 particles and the partial hydrolysis of the polycarbonate matrix. Tensile testing of the composites showed reduction in <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break and <b>yield</b> tensile strength.

The purpose is to give a general view about the results of abrasive wear tests including seven soil types as abrasive media. At the first stage of the research silicious sand was applied between the meshing gears and the wear of plastic and steel gears was evaluated and analyzed from the point of different material properties (<b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break, hardness, <b>yield</b> stress, modulus of elasticity) and its combinations. The different correlations between the experienced wear and material features are also introduced. At the second stage of the project the abrasive sand was replaced with different physical soil types. The abrasive wear of gears is plotted in the function of soil types. The results highlight on the considerable role of physical soil types on abrasive wear resistance and the conclusions contain the detailed wear resistance.

By using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), the crystalline and morphology of PA 66 /UHMWPE blends were analyzed. The results show that UHMWPE toughened PA 66 samples exhibit significantly enhanced impact strength and elongation at break comparison with natural PA 66. The samples of PA 66 with 30 % of UHMWPE/HDPE (mass ratio 3 / 7) blends show impact strength about 2 times and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>yield</b> 7 times more than those of natural PA 66 ． The behavior of HDPE-g-GMA shows an effective compatibilizer for PA 66 /UHMWPE blends, when the mass ratio of PA 66 /(UHMWPE/HDPE) at 70 : 30, the blend indicates the best comprehensive property. The investigation on crystallization and morphology of PA 66 and their blends show that the behaviors of melting about the two components are independent either PA 66 or UHMWPE/HDPE. There are independent melting behaviors, meanwhile, interacted each other between PA 66 and UHMWPE. Due to the good compatibility which HDPE-g-GMA contributed, the homogenous PA 66 /UHMWPE blends could be achieved.

40|$|This project aims to {{investigate}} the influence of UV on the properties under natural and artificial weathering. The real-time outdoor weathering exposures provide the most accurate results but, they are very slow and manufacturers cannot afford to wait {{in order to see}} if a new or improved product formulation is really an improvement. So, accelerated testing methods are designed to simulate natural weathering with the combined action of the most weathering damaging factors; UV radiation, oxygen, temperature and water. Whatever the application, there is a concern regarding the durability of the products because if its useful lifetime can be estimated in short time, their maintenance and replacement can be planned in advance. In this study, recycled PET samples were exposed to UV outdoors and to accelerated weathering up to 13, 000 hr. The mechanical behaviour (tensile and impact), thermal behaviour (DSC), molecular structure analysis (FTIR), flow characteristics (MFI) and surface properties (colour and gloss) of the samples were investigated. The whole body of the samples was substantially unaffected by degradation for long exposure time and this is confirmed by MFI and DSC results. However, the surface of the samples is affected which is seen in FTIR analysis, colour and gloss change. This explains that the photodegradation is a surface effect. FTIR analysis shows an increase in the gauche ratio and decrease in the trans ratio for both types of weathering indicating a less ordered structure after the UV radiation due to chain scission by Norrish Type I and II mechanism. Carboxylic acid is formed as a result of degradation and increases with the extent of UV exposure in both types of weathering, the formation of carboxylic acid by Norrish II is dominated over Norrish I. Colour and gloss measurement shows that the effect of degradation takes place strongly in the first 2000 hr of exposure in natural weathering and extended up to 5000 hr in accelerating weathering due to the formation of microcracks. Mechanical tests show that the UV effect was not significant on bulk properties such as yield stress and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>yield</b> for accelerated weathering samples up to 1000 hours, then dropped by 62...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion place a {{high cost}} on {{the society and}} {{selecting}} the wrong materials in certain environments may have catastrophic consequences. When selecting materials {{there is also the}} different manufacturing methods to consider and there might be a difference in corrosion resistance depending on the way the material is manufactured. Also even high grade stainless steels like super duplex may suffer from corrosion in a specific environment. The scope of the thesis compares the manufacturing methods solution annealing and cold straining on a super duplex stainless steel, and the potential effect on stress corrosion cracking and pitting resistance. Earlier research indicates that there might be some uncertainties regarding this, and the amount of research in this field was lacking compared to studies on austenitic stainless steels. The objective of this thesis was to develop a test setup using modified versions of the ASTM G 36 and G 44 standards testing on as received super duplex stainless steel bolts (UNS S 32760) of both solution annealed and cold strained quality. Tensile testing was performed to determine the <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>yield,</b> and hence being able to determine the percentage of yield for the experiments. The results of the testing were surprising, as the Young’s modulus was around 50 % less than what was expected, due to testing with a threaded bar instead of a smooth. All of the experiments were performed with the bolts stressed to 100 % of offset yield. For the alternate immersion testing, a test jig was designed and used during the whole experiment which was executed over a time period of 936 hours. This setup used magnesium chloride instead of sodium chloride which was specified in the standard to examine if this would accelerate stress corrosion cracking or pitting corrosion. The results from this experiment showed that the solution annealed bolts seemed to exhibit a higher pitting resistance than the cold strained bolts. Also this experiment indicates that this type of experiment may take too long time to be effective. Four 316 L bolts were also tested in the alternate immersion testing and exhibited obvious pitting as expected. The results however must be considered with caution as only two solution annealed bolts and two cold strained bolts were tested. It is therefore not possible to conclude on this matter. In regards to stress corrosion cracking, no cracks were discovered at 10 X magnification, but further metallographic testing should be performed to verify that no cracks are present. The heated immersion testing in magnesium chloride was performed at 90 ℃ instead of 155 ℃ as specified in the standard. An initial test performed for 316 hours produced fracture in the two solution annealed and two cold strained bolts that were tested. No pitting was observed at 10 X magnification. A second heated immersion test was performed for 156 hours and this test may indicate that there is higher stress corrosion cracking resistance in the solution annealed bolts compared to the cold strained. There was however only two bolts of each type tested in this experiment as well, so {{it is not possible to}} conclude without further experiments. No pitting was observed with 10 X magnification on any of the bolts. The final results indicate that solution annealed bolts exhibits a higher resistance in regards to both stress corrosion cracking and pitting corrosion. Further testing needs to be performed however to verify this as there a low number of specimens tested...|$|E

The longitudinal tensile strength test (DIN 50145) was applied on bone-shaped specimen: tensile/tear strength (SigmaB/R), <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> maximum <b>yield</b> stress/rupture (DeltaB/R), and modulus of elasticity were determined of native (NAs; n= 6), decellularized (DAs; n= 6), and decellularized carotid arteries reseeded with human vascular smooth muscle cells and human vascular endothelial cells (RAs; n= 7). Radial distensibility of DAs was significantly lower (113 %) than for NAs (135 %) (P&# 60; 0. 001) or RAs (127 %) (P= 0. 018). At levels of 120 mmHg and more, decellularized matrices burst (120, 160 [n= 2] and 200 mmHg). Although RAs withstood levels up to 300 mmHg, ANOVA revealed a significant difference from NA (P= 0. 018). Compared with native vessels (NAs), SigmaB/R values were lower in DAs (44 %; 57 %) (P= 0. 014 and P= 0. 002, respectively) and were significantly higher in RAs (71 %; 83 %) (both P&# 60; 0. 001).

Two Roll Mill (Model LS- 22005) and 25 Ton Hot Cold Molding Press (Model LS 22025) used for mixing and molding press. Both equipments were supplied by Lotus Scientific. Tensile and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break were determined using a Universal Testing Machine (Model 133004600771) operating at 20 mm/min. Results show that, <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break decreases, but tensile strength, increase with filler loading. This observation is attributed to the rubber–filler interphaseinteraction of carbon black and rubber...|$|R

40|$|Tensile {{properties}} of the woven fabric are very important properties for upholstered furniture manufacturers. In this study the dependencies of tensile {{properties of}} the fabric on yarn air texturing parameters and fabric structure were investigated. It was found, that breaking force and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break depends more on yarn structure, than on air pressure in the texturing jet. The difference of fabric <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break does not exceed 2  % and difference of fabric breaking force does not exceed 5  % when yarns of the same structure but produced with different air pressure in the texturing jet were used in weft. In the case when different structure yarn produced with same pressure in the texturing jet were used in weft, there were difference of breaking force and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break up to 25  % stated. There were also investigated tendencies of tensile properties of fabric dependencies on fabric structure itself. It was stated that weave of the fabric influences <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break and breaking force of the fabric. [URL] </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Composites of {{sugarcane}} bagasse in poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) matrix {{were produced}} by a compression molding method followed by various heat treatment processes, involving slow cooling (annealing), fast cooling (quenching), and re-heating to a temperature below Tg. The effects of the thermal history were examined by the measurement of tensile strength and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break {{as well as by}} differential scanning calorimetry. It was observed that the heat treatments affected the <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break of unfilled PVC significantly with less significant effect on the tensile strengths. In contrast, various tensile strengths of sugarcane bagasse PVC composites were observed after various heat treatments with less significant effect to the <b>elongations</b> <b>at</b> break. In addition, recycling of the composites may erase the effect of thermal history. Uniform tensile properties of the composites were achieved after recycling process...|$|R
