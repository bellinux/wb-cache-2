In this paper we explain the dynamical origin of this current. We show that the dc current is induced by the presence and desymmetrization of ballistic channels inside the stochastic layer. The existence of these channels is due to resonance islands with non-zero winding numbers. The characterization of the <b>flights</b> <b>dynamics</b> inside ballistic channels is described by distribution functions.

500|$|The primary flight {{controls}} of the Tornado are a fly-by-wire hybrid, consisting of an analogue [...] Command and Stability Augmentation System (CSAS) {{connected to a}} digital Autopilot & Flight Director System (AFDS); in addition a level of mechanical reversion capacity was retained to safeguard against potential failure. To enhance pilot awareness, artificial feel was built into the {{flight controls}}, such as the centrally located stick; because of the Tornado's variable wings enabling the aircraft to drastically alter its flight envelope, the artificial responses adjust automatically to wing profile changes and other changes to flight attitude.

500|$|Two of {{the lighter}} {{configurations}} (the Zefiro 23 and the H-25) use upper stages mounted {{on top of}} the booster. Due to the lower weight, it might have been necessary to lower the amount of fuel in a booster to ensure that the separation velocity, the flight path, and the reentry do not exceed design bounds. In the case of H-25, it might be necessary to accelerate the fly-back boosters to above [...] to help the upper stage achieve its desired orbit. Consequently, two solutions were proposed to decelerate the boosters after separation. The first option was to actively decelerate them using [...] of fuel and reduce the velocity by [...] However, launch performance would drop below that of the Vega derivative. Another option is to use aerodynamic forces to decelerate. However, a hypersonic parachute was deemed too expensive and too complex.

500|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the Avro Arrow project, CF-105 chief aerodynamicist Jim Chamberlin led a team of 25 engineers to NASA's Space Task Group to become lead engineers, program managers, and heads of engineering in NASA's manned space programs—projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo.
