25|$|It {{is shown}} that York had gained a little freedom {{while on the}} {{expedition}} with Lewis and Clark. It is mentioned in journals that York went on scouting trips and going to trade with villages so <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> freedom was like while doing that. He might have also been shown respect by Clark because Clark named two geographic discoveries after him; York's Eight Islands and York's Dry Creek. Also they took a poll of where they should stay over one winter and York's opinion was recorded {{even though it was}} last. This shows that York had a taste of freedom and possibly gained some respect by the fellow travelers on the expedition.|$|E
25|$|Led Zeppelin's manager, Peter Grant, {{sometimes}} took extraordinary {{measures to}} combat the practice of live bootleg recordings at Led Zeppelin concerts. He {{is reported to have}} personally visited record stores in London which were selling Led Zeppelin bootlegs and demanded all copies be handed over. He also monitored the crowd at Led Zeppelin concerts so as to locate anything which resembled bootleg recording equipment. At one concert at Vancouver in 1971 <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> he thought was recording equipment {{on the floor of the}} venue and personally ensured that the equipment be destroyed, only to find out later that the equipment was a noise pollution unit being operated by city officials to test the volume of the concert. Similarly, at the Bath Festival in 1970, he personally threw a bucket of water over unauthorised recording equipment.|$|E
25|$|Grant's {{determination}} {{to protect the}} financial interests of Led Zeppelin was also reflected by the sometimes extraordinary measures he took to combat the practice of unauthorized live bootleg recordings. He {{is reported to have}} personally visited record stores in London that were selling Led Zeppelin bootlegs and demanded all copies be handed over. He also monitored the crowd at Led Zeppelin concerts in order to locate anything which resembled bootleg recording equipment.

On another occasion, at the Bath Festival in 1970, he personally threw a bucket of water over unauthorised recording equipment. Grant's famous dressing room scene in the film The Song Remains the Same, where he demands an explanation from concert staff about the sale of illegal posters, was typical of his no-nonsense dealings with people who tried to profit at the band's expense.|$|E

2500|$|Several Chicago Bears {{players and}} fans {{believe that the}} Bears were targets of this program during the second game of the 2011 season, a 30–13 loss to the Saints. Quarterback Jay Cutler was sacked six times, and nearly lost his voice when a Saints player {{kicked him in the}} throat. Later in the game, {{offensive}} tackle Frank Omiyale yanked a Saints defender off Cutler when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> he later called [...] "some dirty stuff." [...] Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Josh Freeman reported that the Saints' tendency toward illegal hits was common knowledge among the Tampa Bay coaching staff. Preparations for Saints games included warnings to offensive players to keep their knees protected, especially on plays near the sidelines.|$|E
2500|$|During 6 March, the III Flak Korps {{anti-aircraft}} gun crews emplaced {{on top of}} the [...] Erpeler Ley, strategically overlooking the Ludendorff Bridge, had been ordered by the Luftwaffe to help defend Koblenz. The replacement unit was not motorized and was placed on the outskirts of Remagen. As the Americans advanced towards the Rhine on the night of 6–7 March, 14 men from the {{anti-aircraft gun}} crews deserted. Bratge only learned about the replacement unit's presence on 7 March when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> was left of the unit manhandling its guns across the bridge. Aware of the Americans' impending arrival, he angrily ordered the unit's Luftwaffe commander to get the weapons moved to the top of Erpeler Ley as quickly as possible, but the units were not yet in place at 2:00 pm when the first Americans arrived.|$|E

2500|$|Ahlquist {{was head}} of the Department of Pharmacology of the University of Georgia School of Medicine, now Georgia Regents University. In 1948 <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> had escaped Dale in 1906. “The adrenotropic receptors have been {{considered}} to be of two classes, those whose action results in excitation and those whose action results in inhibition of the effector cells. Experiments described in this paper indicate that although {{there are two kinds of}} adrenotropic receptors they cannot be classified simply as excitatory or inhibitory since each kind of receptor may have either action depending on where it is found.” Ahlquist chose six agonists, including adrenaline, noradrenaline, α-methylnoradrenaline and isoprenaline, and examined their effects on several organs. He found that the six substances possessed two – and only two – rank orders of potency in these organs. For example, the rank order of potency was ″adrenaline > noradrenaline > α-methylnoradrenaline > isoprenaline″ in promoting contraction of blood vessels, but ″isoprenaline > adrenaline > α-methylnoradrenaline > noradrenaline″ in stimulating the heart. The receptor with the first rank order (for example for blood vessel contraction) he called alpha adrenotropic receptor (now α-adrenoceptor or α-adrenergic receptor), while the receptor with the second rank order (for instance for stimulation of the heart, but also for bronchodilation) he called beta adrenotropic receptor (now β-adrenoceptor or β-adrenergic receptor). ″This concept of two fundamental types of receptors is directly opposed to the concept of two mediator substances (sympathin E and sympathin I) as propounded by Cannon and Rosenblueth and now widely quoted as ‘law’ of physiology. … There is only one adrenergic neuro-hormone, or sympathin, and that sympathin is identical with epinephrine.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Nuaimal Hakim {{told him}} to inquire about his own house where his sister {{and her husband had}} {{converted}} to Islam. Upon arriving at her house, Umar found his sister and brother-in-law Saeed bin Zaid (Umar's cousin) reciting the verses of the Quran from sura Ta-Ha. He started quarreling with his brother-in-law. When his sister came to rescue her husband, he also started quarreling with her. Yet still they kept on saying [...] "you may kill us but we will not give up Islam". Upon hearing these words, Umar slapped his sister so hard that she fell to the ground bleeding from her mouth. When <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> he did to his sister, he calmed down out of guilt and asked his sister to give him what she was reciting. His sister replied in the negative and said [...] "You are unclean, and no unclean person can touch the Scripture." [...] He insisted, but his sister was not prepared to allow him to touch the pages unless he washed his body. Umar at last gave in. He washed his body and then began to read the verses that were: Verily, I am Allah: there is no God but Me; so serve Me (only), and establish regular prayer for My remembrance (Quran 20:14). He wept and declared, [...] "Surely this is the word of Allah. I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah." [...] On hearing this, Hadhrat Khabbab came out from inside and said: [...] "O, Umar! Glad tidings for you. Yesterday Muhammad prayed to Allah, 'O, Allah! Strengthen Islam with either Umar or Abu Jahl, whomsoever Thou likest.' It seems that his prayer has been answered in your favour." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pollock {{observed}} American Indian sandpainting {{demonstrations in}} the 1940s. Referring to {{his style of}} painting on the floor, Pollock stated, “I feel nearer, more {{a part of the}} painting, since this way I can walk round it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting. This is akin to the methods of the Indian sand painters of the West.” Other influences on his drip technique include the Mexican muralists and Surrealist automatism. Pollock denied reliance on [...] "the accident"; he usually had an idea of how he wanted a particular piece to appear. His technique combined the movement of his body, over which he had control, the viscous flow of paint, the force of gravity, and the absorption of paint into the canvas. It was a mixture of controllable and uncontrollable factors. Flinging, dripping, pouring, and spattering, he would move energetically around the canvas, almost as if in a dance, and would not stop until <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> he wanted to see. As another important influence can be cited Wolfgang Paalen's article on Totem Art of the indigenous people of British Columbia and his Fumage paintings which he had seen at Julien Levy's exhibition of Paalen's surrealist paintings in 1940. Pollock owned a signed and dedicated copy of the Amerindian Number of Paalen's magazine (DYN 4-5, 1943), in which the revolutionary space concept in totemist art from the North-West-Coast is broadly discussed from an artist's point of view. Another strong impact must have been Paalen's fumage technique, as it was the surrealist technique with the most magic appeal for those painters who looked for new ways of making appear what was called the unseen or the possible. Fumage was presented also in Matta's workshop about which Steven Naifeh reports: »Once, when Matta was demonstrating the Surrealist technique [...] Fumage, Jackson [...] turned to (Peter) Busa and said in a stage whisper: ›I can do that without the smoke.‹« Pollock's painter friend Fritz Bultman even stated (hinting at the revolutionary possibility-space of Paalen): [...] "It was Wolfgang Paalen, who started it all." ...|$|E

2500|$|The accuser's 14-year-old brother Star {{testified that}} he'd walked into Jackson's bedroom and seen Jackson masturbating {{himself and the}} {{sleeping}} accuser. He testified that he'd meant {{to go to sleep}} in Jackson's room, had found the door [...] "kind of locked, so [...] pushed it, and it opened," [...] and he walked some ways into the room and stopped when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> Gavin and Michael were doing. He testified they were on the bed [...] "outside of the covers," [...] Jackson was on his back with his eyes closed, and Gavin was [...] "curled up" [...] facing away from Jackson and was [...] "kind of snoring." [...] Star couldn't remember what his brother had been wearing but said it might have been [...] "pants or underwears," [...] and that Jackson was wearing [...] "socks, underwears, and an undershirt," [...] but later said Jackson's [...] "hand was in his pants." [...] He variously used the words [...] "pants" [...] and [...] "underwears" [...] for both Gavin and Jackson to describe what they were wearing. One aspect that weakened his testimony was that Star, the only witness to the alleged molestation, claimed he twice walked in on Jackson molesting Gavin and was completely unnoticed, even while tripping the alarm system in the hallway leading to Jackson's bedroom. An alarm or bell would sound whenever anyone approached, and Star claimed that on both occasions the alarm went off and Jackson didn't hear it. Neither did he hear nor see the boy come and go. Star said he stood watching for about four seconds before he [...] "just went back to the guest units." [...] Star testified that two days later he had an almost identical experience. He allegedly walked into Jackson's bedroom and saw that [...] "the same thing was happening," [...] with Jackson [...] "masturbating, stroking up and down" [...] and his other hand moving around in Star's sleeping [...] "brother's underwears." [...] This time Star only stayed for three seconds before returning to the guest units. Star's account of the sexual act on the second occasion matched neither the description he gave during an interview with psychologist Stanley Katz nor his statement given in police interviews in 2003. Star Arvizo {{said in an interview with}} the psychologist on May 29, 2003, that he witnessed Jackson placing his hand on Gavin's crotch outside his clothes. On July 7, 2003, during his first interview with sheriff's investigators, Star changed his story. He claimed that during the first incident Jackson placed his left hand under the front of his brother's pajama pants. Star Arvizo changed his account still a third time during a police interview on August 13, 2003, when he claimed that Jackson had placed his hand inside the front of his brother's boxer shorts. Dr. Katz' grand jury testimony about what Star had told him included a story about Jackson [...] "rubbing his penis against Gavin's buttocks" [...] and another about smelling marijuana. In court, Star denied that he'd made the allegations and refused Mesereau's offer to [...] "refresh [...] recollection [...] that page of [...] testimony." ...|$|E
