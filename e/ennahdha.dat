It eventually led to a thorough democratization of the country and to free and democratic elections with the Tunisian Constitution of 2014, which is seen as progressive, increases human rights, gender equality, government duties toward people, lays the ground for a new parliamentary system and makes Tunisia a decentralized and open government. And with the held of the country first parliamentary elections since the 2011 Arab Spring and its presidentials on 23 November 2014, which finished its transition to a democratic state. These elections were characterized by the fall in popularity of <b>Ennahdha,</b> for the secular Nidaa Tounes party, which became the first party of the country.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, {{the former}} Tunisian {{president}} {{declared that he}} would [...] "fight" [...] the hijab, which {{he refers to as}} [...] "ethnic clothing". Mosques were restricted from holding communal prayers or classes. After the revolution however, a moderate Islamist government was elected leading to more freedom in the practice of religion. It has also made room for the rise of fundamentalist groups such as the Salafists, who call for a strict interpretation of Sharia law. The fall in favour of the moderate Islamist government of <b>Ennahdha</b> was partly due to that, modern Tunisian governments intelligence objectives are to suppress fundamentalist groups before they can pass to act.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Ennahdha</b> Party (حزب حركة النهضة (Mouvement du) Parti <b>Ennahdha),</b> {{also known}} as Renaissance Party or simply <b>Ennahdha,</b> is a {{moderate}} Islamic political party in Tunisia. Founded as [...] "The Movement of Islamic Tendency" [...] in 1981, <b>Ennahdha</b> {{was inspired by the}} Iranian revolution, and Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, but has also been called [...] "the mildest and most democratic Islamist party in history". Rached Ghannouchi was the movement's founder and remains its president.|$|E

5000|$|On 8 August 2014, Toumia {{announced}} {{that she had been}} removed from <b>Ennahdha's</b> lists for the forthcoming election saying that her [...] "only wrong was her frankness, her courage and her imprint on the National Constituent Assembly." [...] As of 2016, she was working for the Ministry of Agriculture, and argued that she and four colleagues had not been promoted due to animosity toward her.|$|R
5000|$|Ahmed Ibrahim of the Tunisian Pole Democratique Moderniste {{political}} bloc {{complained to}} a foreign journalist that <b>Ennahdha</b> appears [...] "soft" [...] on television, [...] "but in the mosques, it is completely different. Some of them are calling for jihad". The general manager of Al Arabiya wrote an editorial expressing the opinion that <b>Ennahdha</b> is fundamentally a conservative Islamist party with a moderate leadership. <b>Ennahdha</b> {{has been described as}} a mixed bag with moderate top layers and a base defined by [...] "a distinctly fundamentalist tilt".|$|E

50|$|The {{regional}} {{context of}} violent exacerbation, {{coupled with the}} local discontent against Ennahdha’s performance in office, has put a huge question mark on the Tunisian transition. Although <b>Ennahdha</b> {{claimed to be a}} moderate political party, its perceived failure to fight extremist groups and its perceived dual speech has strengthened the belief of anti <b>ennahdha</b> people who claimed that this local branch of the Muslim brotherhood was a light cover for more extreme Islamic groups. The political assassinations against two opposition leaders, Chokri Belaid and Mohamed Brahmi, and the killing of Tunisian soldiers by Islamist terrorists in 2013, will polarize public opinion even more. Huge demonstrations started in the summer of 2013 in Bardo asking for both the constitutional assembly and the government to be dissolved. People wanted democracy to succeed, but not at the expense of security and progressive reform. <b>Ennahdha,</b> was committed to remain in office, and claimed its democratic legitimacy over power. Nidaa Tounes and the opposition argued that although <b>Ennahdha</b> access to power was democratic, the transition was supposed to last 1 year only and had one main objective: the drawing of a new democratic and consensual constitution for the country. 1 {{year and a half after}} <b>Ennahdha</b> accession to power, the constitution was far from being completed. The political debate was near a dead-end, and non-political actors will have to step in to find a solution. Civil society will step in a forge a national dialogue initiative to prevent Tunisia’s transition to democracy to fail: the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet was constituted on that premise.|$|E

Unnamed opposition figures welcomed the resignation. The same day, Standard & Poor's downgraded Tunisia's credit rating. However, the IMF said that it was still in talks for a US$1.78 billion loan to the country.

On 25 March 2013, she joined the Al Massar party. The 6 February 2013 assassination of Chokri Belaid, a secular opposition leader followed by a second assassination in July, 2013 of another opposition leader, Mohamed Brahmi resulted in a prolonged battle for power between the secularist and Islamic factions.
