5|$|As part of {{her final}} {{semester}} of study, Levy moved to Washington, D.C., to become a paid intern with the Federal Bureau of Prisons. In October 2000 she began her internship at the bureau's headquarters, where she {{was assigned to the}} public affairs division. <b>Her</b> <b>supervisor,</b> bureau spokesperson Dan Dunne, was impressed with Levy's work, especially her handling of media inquiries regarding the upcoming execution of Timothy McVeigh, convicted of bombing the Oklahoma City Federal Building. Levy's internship was abruptly terminated in April 2001 because her academic eligibility was found to have expired in December 2000. She had already completed her master's degree requirements and was scheduled to return to California in May 2001 for graduation.|$|E
5|$|In July 1937, the Atlantic Monthly {{accepted}} a {{revised version of}} an essay, The World of Waters, that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. <b>Her</b> <b>supervisor</b> had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as Undersea, was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house Simon & Schuster, impressed by Undersea, contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in Under the Sea Wind (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued—her features appeared in Sun Magazine, Nature, and Collier's.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next month}} {{she was called}} into <b>her</b> <b>supervisor's</b> supervisor's office, and told {{to go to an}} {{employee}} counseling service, an act she knew to be punitive, [...] "because you look stressed". The therapist who spoke with her seemed to Francis to be more interested in finding out what she knew about the Lazarus case and who she might have shared it with. After two sessions in which she declined to share that information, she was again called into <b>her</b> <b>supervisor's</b> office and told she was not cooperating and needed to [...] "talk this out". She told the therapist she was getting a lawyer, after which further sessions were canceled as a [...] "mistake".|$|R

5000|$|Monroe Correctional Complex opened [...] in 1910, {{making it}} the second oldest {{operational}} prison in Washington state. On January 29, 2011, Officer Jayme Biendl was strangled to death with an amplifying cord by an inmate within prison walls, inmate Byron Scherf was accused of the murder. Officer Biendl repeatedly filed work orders for additional security measures to <b>her</b> <b>Supervisors</b> which went unanswered. One of <b>her</b> <b>Supervisors</b> Sergeant Jimmy Fletcher signed a sworn affidavit that he signed one of the work orders and forwarded it up the chain of Command. In reaction to the murder, Officers at MCC now carry with them pepper spray, and a [...] "panic button" [...] in case of emergency, and inmates face higher restriction of recreational activities.|$|R

25|$|In 1998, the Fifth Circuit heard United States v. Evans, {{an appeal}} of a parole officer's {{conviction}} on mail-fraud charges stemming from falsified travel vouchers she filed to conceal a relationship and bribery scheme with a parolee. The government's theory was that the vouchers' mailing to state archives in Austin after <b>her</b> <b>supervisor</b> had approved them was {{an essential part of}} the scheme.|$|E
25|$|A divided panel {{overturned}} the convictions. Judge Harold R. DeMoss, Jr., primarily relied on Kann, Parr and Maze in {{finding that the}} mailings occurred after Evans' scheme had come to fruition (when she submitted the vouchers to <b>her</b> <b>supervisor)</b> and were not essential to them. In a footnote, he distinguished the case from Schmuck with the observation that Evans had no long-term relationship to maintain with the employees who kept the records.|$|E

25|$|Anna {{began her}} quest for justice by {{speaking}} out publicly {{when one of}} <b>her</b> <b>supervisors</b> stole money from the workers' bonus fund to win a lottery. Instead of reprimanding the corrupt supervisor, the system turned on her—she was harassed by secret police. The 'exemplary worker' and 'Hero of Socialist Labor' had become a vocal dissident, because the so-called workers state did not care about its workers.|$|R

The police officer who arrested Genie's parents said that he and other authorities who interacted with Genie specifically noted that she did not speak.|$|E
25|$|Francis filed {{her suit}} late in 2013, {{following}} {{the rejection of}} her claim by the city and a finding by the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing {{that she had a}} right to sue. She alleges that after finding that the DNA from the bite belonged to a woman, the LAPD detective supervising her verbally steered her away from Lazarus as a suspect, without naming her. When Nuttall called her and told her the Van Nuys detectives were working the cold case and had identified Lazarus as a suspect, she did not share what <b>her</b> <b>supervisor</b> had told her for fear of retaliation.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{revealed}} on July 15, 2008 by WXYZ reporter Steve Wilson that in 2005 Kwame Kilpatrick, Christine Beatty, {{and the chief}} of police Ella Bully-Cummings allegedly used their positions to help an influential Baptist minister arrested for soliciting a prostitute get his case dismissed. The arresting officer, Antoinette Bostic, was told by <b>her</b> <b>supervisors</b> that Mangedwa Nyathi was a minister (Assistant Pastor at Hartford Memorial Baptist Church on Detroit's west side), and that the mayor and police chief were calling to persuade Bostic not to show up to court, in which case the judge would be forced to dismiss the case against Nyathi. Bostic ignored <b>her</b> <b>supervisors</b> and appeared in court. The defense lawyer, Charles Hammons, had the case postponed {{a couple of times and}} stated in court that “The mayor told me yesterday that this case is not gonna go forward." [...] Hammons admitted to Wilson that this was the fact and that this was how many cases for people who know the mayor in Detroit are handled. Bully-Cummings angrily denied that she had ever asked her officers to perform such acts of impropriety. Kilpatrick stated that Wilson of WXYZ [...] "was just making up stories again." ...|$|R

However, due to their arrest in Indonesia nine days earlier, both Lawrence and Norman failed to appear.|$|E
25|$|Intending {{to become}} a {{pediatric}} neurosurgeon, Mayer took pre-med classes at Stanford University. She later switched her major from pediatric neuroscience to symbolic systems, a major which combined philosophy, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and computer science. At Stanford, she danced in the university ballet's Nutcracker, {{was a member of}} parliamentary debate, volunteered at children's hospitals, and helped bring computer science education to Bermuda's schools. During her junior year, she taught a class in symbolic systems, with Eric S. Roberts as <b>her</b> <b>supervisor.</b> The class was so well received by students that Roberts asked Mayer to teach another class over the summer. Mayer went on to graduate with honors from Stanford with a BS in symbolic systems in 1997 and an MS in computer science in 1999. For both degrees, her specialization was in artificial intelligence. For her undergraduate thesis, she built travel-recommendation software that advised users in natural-sounding human language. In 2009, the Illinois Institute of Technology granted Mayer an honoris causa doctorate degree in recognition of her work in the field of search.|$|E

Several months later she was called into <b>her</b> <b>supervisor's</b> office and asked to relate those events. A month later she told Detective Nuttall, who had spearheaded the reinvestigation that led to Lazarus' arrest, as well.|$|R
