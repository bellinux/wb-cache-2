The soldier remained in the area for an unknown amount of time and was later found dead in the woods. In 1852, a local resident struck metal with a <b>grubbing</b> <b>hoe.</b> The metal was iron bands encasing a small wooden box, and 900 Spanish doubloons were found, valued at $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars), in 1852.|$|E

Finding charred seeds indicates the cultivation of wheat, barley, rye, millet, as well hemp for linen, while the large size pots and the storage pits indicate how the harvests were preserved. The emergence of the first iron farming implements, scythes and <b>grubbing</b> <b>hoes,</b> indicate notable progress in the agricultural practice.|$|R
50|$|The first {{crops to}} grow in the {{township}} were cultivated with a <b>grub</b> <b>hoe,</b> were planted and harvested by hand and yielded an incredible harvest. The fertile land of the Clay Belt was quite impressive to the farmers from the Ottawa Valley who were used to large rocks in their soil. A lot of times those working at the sawmill would clear a small piece of their land a plant a small crop, which required little attention. The nearby rush in Elk Lake created much demand for crops from the Charlton farmers.|$|R

Bacon, an architect and Civil War veteran from New Britain, Connecticut, who in 1876 purchased 172 acre in present-day Ormond-by-the-Sea and named it the Number Nine Plantation. In her book Ormond-On-The-Halifax, Alice Strickland describes the site: [...] "The land {{was covered with a}} dense, tangled forest of palmettos, scrub oaks, and pine trees which Bacon cleared out with axe and <b>grub</b> <b>hoe.</b> The Bacon's first home was a palmetto cabin, but later Bacon built a small, two story house with a large coquina rock fireplace on top of the Indian shell mound." ...|$|R

The center shows the Isthmus with its seas and sky, in which the moon begins to rise above the waves and the sun begins to hide behind the mountain, marking thereby the solemn hour of the {{declaration}} of our independence. The head is divided in two quarters: in the one of the right hand, in the silver field, a sword and a gun are hung meant as abandonment for always to the civil wars, causes of our ruin; in the one of the left-hand side, and on field of gules, a crossed shovel and a <b>grub</b> <b>hoe</b> are shown shining, to symbolize the work [...] " ...|$|R
5000|$|With {{due respect}} to the sadhu, ASI does not go about digging {{on the basis of}} dreams. It has not done so in its 150 years of its history. We are {{conducting}} the excavation on the basis of scientific reports and historical importance. â€” Dr B R Mani, Additional Director-General, ASI [...] The Ministry of Culture stated that the excavation would take 2-3 weeks to reach the depth of any deposits, while ASI officials at the site have said that the excavation may take months, or even years, as they are using only simple basic tools like <b>grub</b> <b>hoes,</b> pick mattocks and fork cultivators. The ASI has designated an area of 80 meters from east to west and 40 meters from north to south near the fort for the excavation. A team of twelve archaeologists from the ASI, led by its Deputy Director, PK Mishra, began excavation at the alleged gold treasure site {{in the presence of the}} Unnao Sub-Divisional Magistrate. The excavation took place in 10 pits, each measuring about 100 square feet. Hundreds of onlookers, Outside Broadcasting B vans, and dozens of journalists from different media organizations were also present. Heavy police security was deployed and night vision cameras were installed to enhance security. Considering the heavy crowd of onlookers, CCTV cameras were installed for security. On 21 October 2013, ASI additional director, Dr. B R Mani, said that after digging 48 cm into the ground, the ASI found a brick wall, shards, pieces of bangles, hopscotch toys and a mud floor which could date back to the 17-19th centuries. Until 24 October 2013, ASI has excavated 217 centimeters of ground. Til 2 November 2013, ASI has excavated 571 centimeters of ground.Sub-divisional magistrate Vijay Shanker Dubey said 70 cm and 30 cm were dug up respectively in two blocks after breaking the rocky base at the fort at Daundiya Kheda village on Saturday, but there is still no sight of the treasure on the 15th day of excavation.|$|R
