Memory <b>for</b> sound <b>content</b> was significantly more reduced by auditory recognition than by auditory spatial interference task. Visual interference tasks reduced significantly memory for sound location but not <b>for</b> sound <b>content.</b> These results suggest that (i) short-term memory <b>for</b> sound <b>content</b> and that <b>for</b> sound location involve partially distinct processing; and (ii) auditory spatial functions are more closely linked to visual functions than auditory recognition...|$|R
