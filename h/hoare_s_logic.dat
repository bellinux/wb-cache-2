40|$|The {{well known}} {{methodology}} of verification of sequential imperative programs is <b>Hoare's</b> <b>logic.</b> <b>S.</b> Sokołowski presented {{an alternative to}} Hoare's logic for partial correctness of deterministic while-programs. Specifications of programs are predicate transformers written as assertions with a single predicate variable. The current report has two different goals ffi to extend the single assertion logic to nondeterministic programs, ffi to handle total correctness. Again, the formalism proposed in this paper is an alternative to various extensions of Hoare's logic. The single assertion logic shows here its edge against the original Hoare's logics, once again. Introduction The well known methodology of verification of sequential imperative programs is Hoare's logic. However it hardly {{can be considered as}} a specification system. It lacks two features ffi compositionality ffi re-usability studied in depth in [4]. In [7] an alternative to Hoare's logic for partial correctness of determin [...] ...|$|R

The characterization sheds lights on problems arising from the way divergence and underspecification are handled. After small changes to the semantic domains we propose a new semantics which is closer to the operational intuitions and suggests a possible solution to the above problems. Finally we give an axiomatic characterization for the equivalence induced by the new semantics which leads to fully abstract models in the sense of Scott...|$|R

Data that have used in this paper were Electrical Conductivity (EC) and Exchange Sodium Percentage (ESP).

40|$|Expressivist {{theories}} of moral discourse deny that moral judgments express truth-apt propositions {{or that they}} correspond to moral facts. Rather, moral judgments are taken to express non-truth-apt and action-guiding attitudes of approval or disapproval. As a result, the classical accounts of validity, consistency and logical consequence cannot be directly applied to moral discourse. These logical limitations are exploited by the Frege-Geach embedding problem, which challenges expressivism {{to account for the}} fact that moral sentences can be embedded into truth-functional contexts, and that they can figure as premises in valid arguments. This thesis examines the embedding problem in detail, and analyzes two prominent expressivist responses to it: Simon Blackburn 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>logic</b> of attitudes, and Allan Gibbard 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> normative <b>logic.</b> It will be argued that neither response presents a complete solution to the embedding problem.
