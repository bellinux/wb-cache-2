500|$|Drizzt {{was created}} by happenstance. In 1987 R.A. Salvatore sent Mary Kirchoff, then {{managing}} editor of TSR's book department, a manuscript for what would become his 1990 novel Echoes of the Fourth Magic. She liked it, but {{asked if he could}} rewrite it to take place in the Forgotten Realms. She sent him Darkwalker on Moonshae by Douglas Niles, the only novel at the time set in the Forgotten Realms. Salvatore sent her a proposal for a sequel to Darkwalker, but Kirchoff sent back a large map of the Forgotten Realms and told him she wanted a new story set in {{a different part of the}} Realms. After two weeks of phone calls, Salvatore found a spot on the map that was not already designated for another project, and he located Icewind Dale there. According to Salvatore, the book was [...] "set on the Moonshae Isles, because at the time <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Realms. When I found out how big the Realms were, I moved the story a thousand miles to the north." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} May, Island Def Jam {{pushed forward}} the release date for Graduation up from September to an {{unspecified}} late August date, a decision that West first announced on the introductory track of his Can't Tell Me Nothing mixtape. On July 19, the album's release date was changed once more and moved to September 11, 2007, the same US release date as rapper 50 Cent's third studio album Curtis. When first presented with the proposal of his label moving the release date of his album yet again {{as well as the}} idea of a sales competition between him and 50 Cent, West initially expressed his indifference towards the thought, saying, [...] "When I heard that thing about the debate, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> stupidest thing. When my album drops and 50's album drops, everybody wins because you're gonna get a lot of good music at the same time." [...] However, then Def Jam president and CEO Jay Z welcomed competition, feeling that it would be prosperous for hip-hop and the date became permanent.|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Eric Warren Singer after he developed {{an interest in the}} banking scandals from the 1980s and 90s, he was looking for [...] "a paranoid thriller vibe" [...] from that period; [...] "The Godfather III was really the only film up to this point that dealt with the banking scandals, because it was really gangster warfare on a corporate level, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best part of the film." [...] Later reviewers compared it directly to The Parallax View (1974) and All The President's Men (1976). [...] Ridley Scott initially expressed an interest in directing the film, and the studio agreed to finance the project, only for Scott to drop out. A year later Tom Tykwer got involved through his agent, but decided a contemporary setting would work better. In April 2007, Clive Owen agreed to perform in The International. He said the script interested him because he was reminded of [...] "those '70s paranoia pictures" [...] and because it combined a factual, intelligent basis with an international thriller plot. The following July, actress Naomi Watts was cast opposite Owen. In August, the film received US$5.4 million from the [...] toward its budget. The following month its funding increased to $7.9 million, based on the board's assessment that two-thirds of The International would be produced in Germany and that a number of Germans were in important roles, such as actors Armin Mueller-Stahl and Axel Milberg, cinematographer Frank Griebe, and production designer Uli Hanisch. Filming began in Berlin on 10 September 2007. Part of the production took place in Babelsberg Studios.|$|E

2500|$|Of these songs, [...] "Weinerschnitzel" [...] {{was used}} on the Fat EP while [...] "All" [...] and [...] "No, All!" [...] were later {{recorded}} for the 1987 album All.

I Like Food' and 'Weinerschnitzel', <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> way of the future, like 'yeah, these songs are more cool than normal songs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} on Sire Records in the United States, backed with [...] "Girl Afraid", in November 1984. It was expected to sell well and, for the first time, a video was made to promote one of the band's tracks. However, the song failed to chart. Rough Trade boss Geoff Travis blamed poor promotion: [...] "I can't understand why 'How Soon Is Now?' wasn't a top 10 single, but perhaps I'm being naive. If only their singles had been played on the radio". Morrissey expressed his disappointment {{in an interview with}} Creem magazine: [...] "It's hard to believe that 'How Soon Is Now?' was not a hit. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> one...".|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{name of a}} smack {{that was}} wrecked some time ago near Yarmouth--at least so my friends there wrote me," [...] said Captain Bream with sudden {{interest}}; and well might he feel interest in the new Evening Star, for it was himself who had given the thousand pounds to purchase her, at Ruth Dotropy's request, {{but he had not}} been told that her skipper, Joe Davidson, had been made admiral of the fleet.|$|E

6000|$|He stared his query, and I went on eagerly: [...] "That is {{what makes}} life at once so splendid and so strange. We are in the wrong world. When <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> right town, it bored me; when I knew it was wrong, I was happy. So the false optimism, the modern {{happiness}}, tires us because it tells us we fit into this world. The true happiness is that we don't fit. We come from somewhere else. We have lost our way." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the present}} he seemed quite lost. He {{had made no}} plans. When I {{suggested}} that he should go to bed {{he said he could}} not sleep; he wanted to go out and walk about the streets till day. He was evidently in no state to be left alone. I persuaded him to stay the night with me, and I put him into my own bed. I had a divan in my sitting-room, and could very well sleep on that. He was by now so worn out that he could not resist my firmness. I gave him a sufficient dose of veronal to insure his unconsciousness for several hours. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best service I could render him.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{at first}} seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man {{could not do}} very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a {{tinsmith}} and had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I was used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right leg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come along, and he made me a new head out of tin.|$|E
60|$|MISS BEECH. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> coming! <b>I</b> don't {{approve of}} your making love at your time of life; don't you think I 'm going to {{encourage}} you.|$|R
6000|$|... "You and I {{have always}} fought shy of it," [...] he said, [...] "making a pretence {{that it had}} {{altogether}} passed away. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> best for you." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{went up to}} her to ask her the {{day before}} yesterday; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best way. I told her I wanted to know her better, {{and would like to}} come and see her in her room--they tell me she has got a lovely room--and that if she had heard {{anything}} against me, perhaps she would tell me when I came. But she was more distant than ever, and she just turned it off; said that she had never heard me mentioned, and that her room was too small to receive visitors. I suppose she spoke the truth, but I am sure she has got some reason, all the same. She has got some idea, and I am bound to find out before I go, if I have to ask everybody in the house. I am right down curious. I wonder if she doesn't think me refined--or if she had ever heard anything against Bangor? I can't think it is that. Don't you remember when Clara Barnard went to visit New York, three years ago, how much attention she received? And you know Clara is Bangor, to the soles of her shoes. Ask William Platt--so long as he isn't a native--if he doesn't consider Clara Barnard refined.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding his past, he stated, [...] "I became {{all those}} things society {{expected}} me to become. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only thing I could be." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{tradition}} Serkin began {{of ending}} the summer with {{a performance of}} the Beethoven Choral Fantasy (Beethoven) - in which most participants, even non-singers, joined in the chorus - was discontinued with his death in 1991, but was reinstated {{a few years later}}. As then co-director Richard Goode told Alex Ross, [...] "Many people felt that Serkin playing the Choral Fantasy was a unique experience that could never be duplicated. After he died, the work was retired, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> right decision. To my surprise, a few years later people said, 'You know, I think {{we have to have a}} Choral Fantasy.' We needed the catharsis." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 1972 {{interview}} with Sounds, guitarist Dave Hill said: [...] ""Coz I Luv You" [...] {{was a different}} kind of song, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> perfect simple song that made number one so easy, you know? [...] "Look Wot You Dun" [...] was a classic kind of song, with a clean, classy arrangement to it, but then [...] "Take Me Back 'Ome" [...] was a live, earth-dirt song - I felt much more out of that than I did from all the rest, it projected more, and it wasn't just a hit record. I didn't know if that kind of song could make it, and it was great having a thick, dirty song up at number one." ...|$|E

"The Mag-pye alone, {{of all the}} Birds, had the Art of {{building}} a Nest, the Form of which was with a covering over Head, and only a small Hole to creep out at.—The rest of the Birds, being without Houses, desired the Pye {{to teach them how}} to build one.—A Day is appointed, and they all meet.—The Pye then says, [...] "You must lay two Sticks across, thus."—"Aye, says the Crow, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> way to begin.—Then lay a Feather, or a Bit of Moss.—Certainly, says the Jack-Daw, I knew that must follow.—Then place more Sticks, Straws, Feathers and Moss, in such a manner as this.—Aye, without doubt, cries the Starling, that must necessarily follow; any one could tell how to do that." ...|$|E

[...] Recalls Korine, [...] "I saw his face and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> boy I dreamed of, that was my Tummler. There was a beauty about him." [...] Producer Scott Macaulay on Sutton stated, [...] "He's this person that Harmony sort of found and put {{in the middle of this}} movie, which is at times realistic and at times magical. I think of Nick as being Harmony's equivalent of Herzog's Bruno S." [...] (See The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser & Stroszek).|$|E
5000|$|Kody Zimmermann came up {{with the}} idea reading Dracula while working as an actor's assistant: [...] "I felt like...the vampire was a metaphor for the boss from hell. I was always {{interested}} in the Renfield character in Dracula, and no one ever really did his story - that I know of. What kind of a person would devote himself to this sinister, Satanic agent and still call himself a human being? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> connection - you are crazy for being part of this world, but you are not exactly the main character, either. I wanted to bridge those two things, and I think it fit well while I was writing it: serving this greater being while being caught up in this insanity. A lot of us go into these jobs where we ask ourselves, “why are we doing this”.|$|E
5000|$|When Akon {{was signed}} by Universal imprint SRC Records it was [...] "Lonely" [...] that had {{immediately}} {{caught the attention of}} SRC A&R Jerome Foster and convinced him of Akon's talents. On hearing the demo track he had said, [...] "This kid is official - this is a huge record." [...] Despite offering the album's best option in terms of commercial breakthrough, SRC Records chose [...] "Locked Up" [...] over [...] "Lonely" [...] as the first single because SRC wanted to break Akon in the streets first and work towards a cross-over. According to Foster in an interview with HitQuarters, [...] ""Locked Up" [...] is a street record. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> place for us to start to get a fan-base knowing that we had a record like [...] "Lonely", which was more commercial, to follow it." ...|$|E
