500|$|The least {{expensive}} route for Kanae to Japan was through Russia. [...] He set off from Paris on 30 June 1916 via England, Norway, and Sweden. [...] In Moscow {{he met the}} Japanese consul and the social critic Noburu Katagami; the latter introduced him to proletarian art and encouraged him to visit Yasnaya Polyana, Leo Tolstoy's home which he had made into a farmers' school. [...] The experienced moved Kanae, who later was to write, [...] "While I was staying in Moscow {{in the summer of}} 1916, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> two important missions. [...] One was promotion of children's free painting and the other was establishment of farmers' art." [...] Kanae visited the Moscow Kustar' Museum, which had exhibited peasant arts and crafts since 1885. [...] He praised its sturdy quality and ethnic design, and lamented that industrialization had brought about a degradation in its perceived value and was threatening its survival. [...] An exhibition of children's art impressed Kanae with its free expressiveness.|$|E
500|$|On 20 November, Chamakh {{scored a}} goal in a 3–2 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in the North London derby. A week later, he {{converted}} another goal, {{this time in}} a 4–2 win over Aston Villa. Following the goal against Villa, Chamakh went scoreless in the winter months, often appearing as a substitute in {{a majority of the}} matches. In matches he did start, he was often substituted on early in the second half. On 15 February 2011, he admitted that he felt burnt-out, stating, [...] "By the start of January <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> completely lost my edge." [...] The striker also admitted he needed some rest and wouldn't return to full form until March. On 20 February, Chamakh played the entire match in Arsenal's 1–1 draw with Leyton Orient in the FA Cup. It {{was the first time in}} nearly two months he had played the full 90 minutes in a match. On 2 March, in the replay against Leyton Orient, Chamakh scored his first goal since November in a 5–0 win.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} one of the few in the series that has no paranormal {{elements}} to it. Carter said of the episode's conception, [...] "My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and I wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into. It's a little bit different for us. It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed." [...] Nutter said [...] "In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. It could come from the person next door." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vittorini's {{death in}} 1966 greatly {{affected}} Calvino. [...] He went through {{what he called}} an [...] "intellectual depression", which the writer himself described as an important passage in his life: [...] "...I ceased to be young. Perhaps it's a metabolic process, something that comes with age, I'd been young for a long time, perhaps too long, suddenly <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to begin my old age, yes, old age, perhaps {{with the hope of}} prolonging it by beginning it early." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite criticisms that Gibson {{deliberately}} added {{additional material}} to the historical accounts of first-century Judea and biblical accounts of Christ's crucifixion, some scholars defend the film as not being primarily concerned with historical accuracy. Biblical scholar Mark Goodacre protested {{that he could not}} find one documented example of Gibson explicitly claiming the film to be historically accurate. Gibson has been quoted as saying: [...] "I think that my first duty is to be as faithful as possible in telling the story so that it doesn't contradict the Scriptures. Now, so long as it didn't do that, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a pretty wide berth for artistic interpretation, and to fill in some of the spaces with logic, with imagination, with various other readings." ...|$|E
2500|$|That is {{when the}} man Herrera had {{believed}} to be his father gave him the stunning news of his Mexican birth, and said, [...] "Son, you don't have to go, they can't draft you...you aren't an American citizen." [...] Even {{in the face of}} these multiple shocks, and a perfect opportunity to dodge the war, Herrera was unswayed. [...] As he later related, [...] "I thought, I'm going anyway. [...] I didn't want anybody to die in my place... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my adopted country that had been so nice to me. [...] I thought, I have an American wife and the kids and one on the way." [...] It was only the first of several life-changing acts of heroism Herrera would take.|$|E

2500|$|An {{only child}} not {{especially}} {{close to his}} parents, the young Clark had a boyhood that was often solitary, but he was generally happy. He later recalled {{that he used to}} take long walks, talking to himself, a habit he believed stood him in good stead as a broadcaster: [...] "Television is a form of soliloquy". On a modest scale Clark senior collected pictures, and the young Kenneth was allowed to rearrange the collection. He developed a competent talent for drawing, for which he later won several prizes as a schoolboy. When he was seven he was taken to an exhibition of Japanese art in London, which was a formative influence on his artistic tastes; he recalled, [...] "dumb with delight, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> entered a new world".|$|E
2500|$|Luton {{went into}} {{administration}} during the 2007–08 season and Coyne {{was sold to}} Colchester United for a Colchester record transfer fee of £350,000 in January 2008 to obtain necessary funding for the club. Colchester manager Geraint Williams said: [...] "It's great news for the club. Chris is a defender with experience and leadership qualities." [...] However, Coyne was unable to help prevent Colchester from being relegated {{at the end of}} the season. Coyne was named Colchester United club captain for the 2008–09 season, but selection for the Australia national team, injuries and a change of management meant that he struggled to hold on to a place in the first team, and {{at the end of the}} season, he met with the club management to resolve his future. He left the club by mutual consent in July 2009, saying, [...] "Unfortunately, after 18 months here, it's time to move on. It was made clear that I wasn't going to play week in, week out and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to look at that and address it. Also, there isn't much of a chance for the Australian manager to watch League One football but in Australia, I'm guaranteed to play 27 games in front of him." [...] Coyne scored once for the club, his goal coming in a 4–3 defeat against West Bromwich Albion on 29 March 2008.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was placed}} in solitary {{confinement}} with clothing, a pallet bed, table and armchair in [...] "the worst of all the cells", where he suffered greatly from the darkness, summer heat and [...] "millions of fleas". He was soon housed {{with a series of}} cell mates, and after five months and a personal appeal from Count Bragadin was given warm winter bedding and a monthly stipend for books and better food. During exercise walks he was granted in the prison garret, he found a piece of black marble and an iron bar which he smuggled back to his cell; he hid the bar inside his armchair. When he was temporarily without cell mates, he spent two weeks sharpening the bar into a spike on the stone. Then he began to gouge through the wooden floor underneath his bed, knowing that his cell was directly above the Inquisitor's chamber. Just three days before his intended escape, during a festival when no officials would be in the chamber below, Casanova was moved to a larger, lighter cell with a view, despite his protests that he was perfectly happy where he was. In his new cell, [...] "I sat in my armchair like a man in a stupor; motionless as a statue, I saw that I had wasted all the efforts I had made, and I could not repent of them. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> nothing to hope for, and the only relief left to me was not to think of the future." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{paused for}} a moment, and drank from his tumbler. There were dark lines under his eyes, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ought to stop him talking.|$|R
