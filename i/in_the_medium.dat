5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>medium.</b> As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E

5|$|The {{experimental}} determination of pKa values is commonly performed {{by means of}} titrations, in a medium of high ionic strength and at constant temperature. A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>medium</b> is acidified with a strong acid {{to the point where}} the compound is fully protonated. The solution is then titrated with a strong base until all the protons have been removed. At each point in the titration pH is measured using a glass electrode and a pH meter. The equilibrium constants are found by fitting calculated pH values to the observed values, using the method of least squares.|$|E

40|$|Development of serum-free {{suspension}} {{cell culture}} processes {{is very important}} for influenza vaccine production. Previously, we developed a MDCK suspension cell line in a serum-free <b>medium.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study, the growth kinetics of suspension MDCK cells and influenza virus production <b>in</b> <b>the</b> serum-free <b>medium</b> were investigated, in comparison with those of adherent MDCK cells in both serum-containing and serum-free medium. It was found that <b>the</b> serum-free <b>medium</b> supported <b>the</b> stable subculture and growth of both adherent and suspension cells. In batch culture, for both cell lines, <b>the</b> growth kinetics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> serum-free <b>medium</b> was comparable with those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> serum-containing <b>medium</b> and a commercialized serum-free <b>medium.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> serum-free <b>medium,</b> peak viable cell density (VCD), haemagglutinin (HA) and median tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50) titers of the two cell lines reached 4. 51 × 106 cells/mL, 2. 94 Log 10 (HAU/ 50 μL) and 8. 49 Log 10 (virions/mL), and 5. 97 × 106 cells/mL, 3. 88 Log 10 (HAU/ 50 μL), and 10. 34 Log 10 (virions/mL), respectively.
