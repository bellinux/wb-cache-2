40|$|Train {{and track}} {{interactions}} during services normally generate substantial forces on railway tracks. Such forces are transient by nature and of relatively large magnitude and {{are referred to}} as impact loading. There has been no comprehensive review of the typical characteristics of the loading conditions for railway track structures, in particular, impact loads due to the wheel/rail interaction, published in the literature. This paper presents a review of basic design concepts for railway tracks, abnormalities on tracks, and a variety of typical dynamic impact loadings imparted by wheel/rail interaction and irregularities. The characteristics of typical impact loads due to wheel and rail irregularities, e. <b>g.</b> <b>rail</b> corrugation, wheel flats and shells, worn wheel and rail profiles, bad welds or joints, and track imperfections, are presented with particular emphasis on the typical shapes of the impact load waveforms generally found on railway tracks.

40|$|In {{transportation}} planning, {{there can}} be long lead times to adapt capacity. This article addresses two questions. First, in a one mode world (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>rail</b> or road), what is the optimal capacity choice when faced with uncertain demand, long lead times, and congestion. Using a simple analytical model, it is shown that when demand is inelastic, it is socially optimal to invest more than if only the expected level of demand is taken into account. In this case, it may be beneficial to overinvest in capacity because congestion costs are an increasing function of relative use. This result holds with or without optimal tolling. The second question deals with 2 competing modes in which only one mode has long lead times for capacity, whereas the other has flexible capacity. This is typical for the competition between high-speed rail and air for the medium distance trips (500 – 1, 000 km), or for the competition between inland waterways and trucks for freight. We find that overinvestment is less justified because the substitute mode can more easily absorb the high-demand outcomes. ...|$|E
40|$|Shifting {{transportation}} to electrified modes, e. <b>g.,</b> <b>rail,</b> is a politically attractive way of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector. There is a vivid {{debate about the}} effects such a shift has on GHG emission and how these should be assessed and appraised. We argue that this debate largely originates from differences in how the debaters characterize the situation at hand, in particular how markets are organized and which policy instruments are in place. To shed light on this, we start by identifying the appropriate assessment approach in a hypothetical situation without any climate or energy policies and then gradually add realistic circumstances into the equation. Our main conclusion is that evaluating the climate impacts from a transportation shift is a highly complex task in the initial situation. The closer we move towards a climate-policy architecture of the current EU-type, the simpler the task becomes. Given a comprehensive global climate treaty, {{there is no need}} for any special treatment of the GHG effects since all relevant effects then would be internalized in producer and consumer prices...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of the EU noise policy is mapping of noise and noise effects and the formulation of noise action plans. In the Netherlands, due to the new policy on noise (MIG), the municipalities will be responsible for the formulation of a local noise policy. An instrument for the assessment of the noise and noise effects in a municipality or a region can form the basis of setting realistic goals.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 years {{there has been}} a {{tremendous}} growth in air transportation of passengers. Both airports and airspace are close to saturation with respect to capacity, leading to delays caused by disruptions. At the same time the amount of vehicular traffic around and in all larger cities of the world has show a dramatic increase as well. Public transportation by e. <b>g.</b> <b>rail</b> has come into focus, and hence also the service level provided by suppliers ad public transportation. These transportation systems are likewise very vulnerable to disruptions. In the airline industry there is a long tradition for using advanced mathematical models as the basis for planning of resources as aircraft and crew.

Commercial IT-systems supplying decision support for recovery of disrupted operations are becoming available. The use of advanced planning and recovery methods in the railway industry currently gains momentum. The current paper gives a short overview over the methods used for planning and disruption management in the airline industry.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an intelligent image processing algorithm capable of detecting fatigue defects from images of the rail surface. The links between the defect detection algorithm and 3 D models for rail crack propagation are investigated, considering the influence of input parameters (materials, vehicle characteristics, loading conditions). The dynamic behaviour at the wheel-rail interface resulting in contact forces responsible for stressing and straining the rail material are imported from vehicle dynamics simulations. The integration of the simulated results from vehicle dynamics, contact and fracture mechanics models offer more reliable estimation of the stress intensity factors (SIF). Also the sensitivity analysis related to materials, vehicle characteristics, and loading conditions will provide further understanding of the factors that influence crack propagation in rails such as shear stresses, hydraulic pressure, fluid entrapment and squeeze film effect. This novel application of image processing for the detection of rail surface rolling contact fatigue (RCF) damage and automatic incorporation in a crack growth model represents an important contribution to the development of modern techniques for non-destructive rail inspection. This will result in improved planning/scheduling of future rail maintenance (e. <b>g.</b> <b>rail</b> grinding, renewal), less disruptions and reduced track maintenance costs in rail industry...|$|E

Furthermore, there are recommended maximum access distances of 400 m for lower quality PT services (e. g., bus) and 800 m for higher quality PT services (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>rail).</b> This study investigates associations between commuting behaviours and distance to bus and rail stops from residence and workplace, and the PT access thresholds and densities {{in a sample of}} 238 employed adults drawn from the RESIDE study in Perth, Australia. Self-reported usual workplace travel mode was compared with objectively derived home to work commute distance, and distance to the nearest rail and bus stops from residence and workplace. Overall, 207 (87. 0 %) participants usually commuted to work by private motor vehicle (PMV), and 31 (13. 0 %) participants commuted by PT modes. Those who travelled to work using PT modes had longer commute distances, but had bus and rail stops located closer to their workplace compared with respondents who commuted using PMV modes. Compared with those only having proximate residential PT access, respondents who only had proximate workplace PT access (adjusted OR= 11. 57), or had both proximate residence and workplace PT access (adjusted OR= 16. 51) were substantially more likely to commute to work using PT modes. These findings highlight the importance of proximate PT infrastructure both near home and workplaces.

40|$|Rail {{transport}} authorities {{around the}} world have been facing a significant challenge when predicting rail infrastructure maintenance work {{for a long period of}} time. Generally, maintenance monitoring and prediction is conducted manually. With the restrictions in economy, the rail transport authorities are in pursuit of improved modern methods, which can provide precise prediction of rail maintenance time and location. The expectation from such a method is to develop models to minimize the human error that is strongly related to manual prediction. Such models will help them in understanding how the track degradation occurs overtime under the change in different conditions (e. <b>g.</b> <b>rail</b> load, rail type, rail profile). They need a well-structured technique to identify the precise time that rail tracks fail in order to minimize the maintenance cost/time and secure the vehicles. The rail track characteristics that have been collected over the years will be used in developing rail track degradation prediction models. Since these data have been collected in large volumes and the data collection is done both electronically and manually, it is possible to have some errors. Sometimes these errors make it impossible to use them in prediction model development. This is one of the major drawbacks in rail track degradation prediction. An accurate model can play a key role in the estimation of the long-term behavior of rail tracks. Accurate models increase the track safety and decrease the cost of maintenance in long term. In this research, a short review of rail track degradation prediction models has been discussed before estimating rail track degradation for the curve sections of Melbourne tram track system using Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{growth in}} railway {{infrastructure}} {{has led to}} numerous environmental technical challenges. This includes ground-borne vibration, which is becoming an increasing problem, particularly in urban environments. A common source of this vibration is local defects (e. <b>g.</b> <b>rail</b> joints, switches and crossings) which cause large amplitude excitations at isolated locations. Modelling this type of excitation mechanism using typical linear frequency domain analysis is challenging and therefore non-linear time domain methods are required. Therefore, in this study a validated and comprehensive time domain, three-dimensional ground vibration prediction model is used to investigate the vibrations generated at the wheel/rail contact due to local rail and wheel surface defects. Different types of rail and wheel defect are mathematically modelled, including rail joints, switches, crossings and wheel flats. The track is modelled as a typical ballasted track, using a two-step approach where the vehicle/track dynamics and ground wave propagation are simulated separately. The first step models the effect of railway vehicles (using a multibody approach with many degrees of freedom) on the dynamic excitation of the track and incorporates a non-linear Hertzian contact law at the wheel/rail interface. The second step applies these track-vehicle model forces to a finite/infinite element model to accurately generate vibration time histories for required ground-borne vibration assessment. This work focuses on the AM 96 trainset, largely used in the Brussels Region (Belgium). The geometries {{of a variety of}} local defect types are analysed and a sensitivity analysis is undertaken based on the defect size and train speed. It is found that defect type and geometry have a significant influence on vibration levels, and that only selected geometry types are effected by train speed...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the Quiet-Track project is to provide step-changing track based noise mitigation and maintenance schemes for railway rolling noise in LRT (Light Rail Transit) networks. WP 4 in particular focuses on the combination of existing track based solutions to yield a global performance of at least 6. dB(A). The validation was carried out using a track section in the network of Athens Metro Line 1 with an existing outside concrete slab track (RHEDA track) where high airborne rolling noise was observed. The procedure for the selection of mitigation measures is based on numerical simulations, combining WRNOISE and IMMI software tools for noise prediction with experimental determination of the required track and vehicle parameters (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel roughness). The availability of a detailed rolling noise calculation procedure allows for detailed designing of measures and of ranking individual measures. It achieves this by including the modelling of the wheel/rail source intensity and of the noise propagation {{with the ability to}} evaluate the effect of modifications at source level (e. g., grinding, rail dampers, wheel dampers, change in resiliency of wheels and/or rail fixation) and of modifications in the propagation path (absorption at the track base, noise barriers, screening). A relevant combination of existing solutions was selected in the function of the simulation results. Three distinct existing solutions were designed in detail aiming at a high rolling noise attenuation and not affecting the normal operation of the metro system: Action 1 : implementation of sound absorbing precast elements (panel type) on the track bed, Action 2 : implementation of an absorbing noise barrier with a height of 1. 10 - 1. 20. m above rail level, and Action 3 : installation of rail dampers.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an inverse}} analysis of unobserved trigger factors according to “slope failure types ” based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Quantitative prediction models generally elucidate {{the relationship between}} past slope failures and causal factors (e. g., geology, topography, soil, slope, aspect, drainage, land cover, etc.), but do not consider trigger factors (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>rail</b> fall, earthquake, weathering, etc.), due to difficulties in pixel-by-pixel observations of trigger factors. As one of the measures, an inverse analysis algorithm on trigger factor has been proposed according to the following steps: � Step 1 : The relationship between past slope failures (i. e., the endogenous variables), causal and trigger factors (i. e. the exogenous variables) are delineated on the path diagram used in SEM approach, � Step 2 : The regression weights in the path diagram are estimated based on the maximum likelihood estimation procedure; and � Step 3 : Through the “measurement equation ” defined between the causal factors (i. e., observed variables) and the trigger factor (i. e., unobserved latent variable), the trigger factor is inversely estimated, and a trigger factor influence (TFI) map is also produced. As a subsequent subject from previous study, the TFI maps are produced with respect to “different types ” of slope failures which are “surface failure, ” “deep-seated slope failures, ” and “landslides, ” separately. As a final outcome, the differences in these TFI maps are delineated on a “difference (DIF) map. ” These DIF maps enable us to analyze the difference of trigger factor influence with respect to slope failure types simultaneously. Such “heuristic information ” would be useful for assessing the hazardous area {{with respect to the}} different types of slope failures, as well as for improving the cost-effectiveness in locating various slope measuring systems (e. g., the tensiometer, the rain gage, etc.). 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{perceived}} {{public transport}} quality {{is an important}} driver that influences both customer satisfaction and mobility choices. The competition among transport operators needs {{to improve the quality}} of the services and identify which attributes are perceived as relevant by passengers. Among the "traditional" public transport quality attributes there are, for example: travel and waiting time, regularity of the services, and ticket price. By contrast, there are some "non-conventional" attributes that could significantly influence customer satisfaction jointly with the "traditional" ones. Among these, the beauty/aesthetics of the transport terminals (e. <b>g.</b> <b>rail</b> station and bus terminal) is probably one of the most impacting on user perception. Starting from these considerations, the point stressed in this paper was if (and how munch) the travel experience of the overall travel (e. g. how long is the travel, how many transport modes must be used) influences the perception of the public transport quality. The aim of this paper was to investigate the weight of the terminal quality (e. g. aesthetic, comfort and service offered) within the overall travel experience. The case study was the extra-urban Italian bus network. The passengers of the major Italian terminal bus were interviewed and the analysis of the results shows that about the 75 % of the travelers, are available to pay up to 30 % more for the ticket price for having a high quality terminal. A travel experience effect was observed: the average perceived transport quality varies with the characteristic of the overall trip. The passengers that have a "long trip" (travel time greater than 2 hours) perceived as "low" the overall quality of the trip even if they pass through a high quality terminal. The opposite occurs for the "short trip" passengers. This means that if a traveler passes through a high quality station, the overall perception of that terminal could be significantly reduced if he is tired from a long trip. This result is important and if confirmed through other case studies, will allow to conclude that the "travel experience impact" must be considered as an explicit design variable for public transport services and planning...|$|E
40|$|The coastal {{section of}} the London to Penzance railway line (Dawlish-Teignmouth) lies very close to sea level and has been {{susceptible}} to frequent closure during high seas and storm events. As the main railway connection for the southwest of England {{to the rest of}} Great Britain, it is a vital transport link for the Devon and Cornwall economy. Current understanding of future sea-level rise in the region is compromised by a lack of reliable geological data on which to establish accurate future sea-level projections. Furthermore, the impacts – in engineering and economic terms – of potential sea-level change on the long-term functioning of the main railway are unclear, and future policy making and planning are compromised by a similar gap in scientific knowledge. The central aim of this thesis is to establish the extent to which future sea-level changes will impact upon the Southwest’s main railway line. This aim carries three objectives: (1) to establish accurate sea-level trends over the last 4000 years (late Holocene) in order to validate geophysical models used in current future sea-level projections in the southwest of England; (2) to establish the likely impacts of future sea-level change on the functioning of the Dawlish-Teignmouth railway line; and (3) to integrate climate and socio-economic futures (scenarios) in an internally consistent manner for future use in regional policy debates. In addressing these objectives, we estimate that during the last 2000 years the coast of south Devon has subsided at a rate of ~ 1. 1 mm/yr, generating a relative sea-level rise of ~ 0. 9 mm/yr. The geophysical model (used to determine regional sea-level projections) underestimates the geologically estimated coastal subsidence rate by only 17 %, which would generate an additional sea-level rise, compared to predicted values, of 0. 014 m by 2100. Based on an empirical trend between increases in sea-level changes and rail functioning during the last 40 years, the corrected sea-level projections provide input for establishing future days with line restrictions due to overtopping on the Southwest Mainline. Impacts to both the Southwest economy (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>rail</b> users) and the infrastructure owners have been determined, and integrating these forecasts with socio-economic scenarios (SES) has highlighted the important interaction between climate and socio-economic trends and future vulnerability. In a worst case scenario (e. g., high emissions), rail services are predicted to be disrupted (on average) for around 35 % of the winter by 2060. By this stage, the cost of these disruptions will have exceeded the capital needed for constructing a new alternative inland route.

40|$|Railway track {{stiffness}} (vertical track load {{divided by}} track deflection) {{is a basic}} parameter oftrack design which influences the bearing capacity, the dynamic behaviour of passing vehiclesand, in particular, track geometry quality {{and the life of}} track components. Track stiffness is abroad topic and in this thesis some aspects are treated comprehensively. In the introductionpart of the thesis, track stiffness and track stiffness measurements are put in their propercontext of track maintenance and condition assessment. The first aspect is measurement of track stiffness. During the course of this project, Banverkethas developed a new device for measurement of dynamic track stiffness called RSMV(Rolling Stiffness Measurement Vehicle). The RSMV is capable of exciting the trackdynamically through two oscillating masses above one wheelset. The dynamic stiffness is acomplex-valued quantity where magnitude is the direct relation between applied load anddeflection (kN/mm) and phase is a measure of deflection-delay by comparison with force. Thephase has partial relationship with damping properties and ground vibration. The RSMVrepeatability is convincing and both overall measurements at higher speeds (up to 50 km/h) and detailed investigations (below 10 km/h) can be performed. The measurement systemdevelopment is described in Paper A and B. The second aspect is evaluation of track stiffness measurements along the track from a trackengineering perspective. Actual values of stiffness as well as variations along the track areimportant, but cannot always answer maintenance and design related questions alone. InPaper D track stiffness is studied in combination with measurements of track geometryquality (longitudinal level) and ground penetrating radar (GPR). The different measurementsare complementary and a more reliable condition assessment is possible by the combinedanalysis. The relation between soft soils and dynamic track stiffness measurements is studiedin Paper C. Soft soils are easily found and quantified by stiffness measurements, in particularif the soft layer is in {{the upper part of the}} substructure. There are also possibilities to directlyrelate substructure properties to track stiffness measurements. Environmental vibrations areoften related to soft soils and partly covered in Paper C. One explanation of the excitationmechanism of train induced environmental vibrations is short waved irregular supportconditions. This is described in Paper E, where track stiffness was evinced to have normalvariations of 2 – 10 % between adjacent sleepers and variations up to 30 % were found. Anindicative way of finding irregular support conditions is by means of filtering longitudinallevel, which is also described in the paper. Train-track interaction simulation is used in PaperH to study track stiffness influence on track performance. Various parameters of trackperformance are considered, e. <b>g.</b> <b>rail</b> sectional moment, rail displacement, forces at wheel-railinterface and on sleepers, and vehicle accelerations. Determining optimal track stiffness froman engineering perspective is an important task as it impacts all listed parameters. The third aspect, efficient maintenance, is only partially covered. As track stiffness relates toother condition data when studied from a maintenance perspective, vertical geometricaldefects (longitudinal level and corrugation/roughness) are studied in paper F. The generalmagnitude dependency of wavelength is revealed and ways of handling this in conditionassessment are proposed. Also a methodology for automated analysis of a large set ofcondition data is proposed in Paper G.

40|$|The Hunter Valley coal {{supply chain}} (HVCC) {{is the system}} of {{logistics}} facilities - principally a network of rail track and three coal handling terminals - enabling coal mined by producers in the Hunter Valley to be transported, assembled, and loaded onto ships for export. The HVCC serves around 11 producers operating through more than 30 coal load points in the Hunter Valley, transporting coal over rail track extending around 450 km inland, managed by two track owner/operators, via rolling stock from four rail haulage providers that make around 22, 000 train trips for approximately 1, 400 vessels per year. The HVCC now delivers around 140 million tonnes of coal per annum (Mtpa), with the port of Newcastle exporting more coal by volume than any other facility in the world. The Hunter Valley Coal Chain Coordinator P/L (HVCCC) is the organization {{at the heart of}} this logistics operation. In a landmark for collaborative logistics, the HVCCC was established by HVCC stakeholders to plan and manage the valuable shared infrastructure of the system. The HVCCC provides a range of services vital to the planning and delivery of coal through the logistics system, with its core task to improve the capacity of the coal chain through a centralised planning process. One of the key ways in which this task is achieved is through the alignment of maintenance activities. All key assets in the HVCC (e. <b>g.</b> <b>rail</b> track sections, coal stacking machinery, terminal conveyor systems) undergo regular preventive maintenance, planned well in advance. While undergoing maintenance, an asset cannot function to deliver coal (or can function only with reduced capacity), thus reducing the capacity of the system. However astute scheduling of these planned maintenance activities releases latent capacity. Such astute scheduling is referred to as capacity or maintenance alignment, and is a core function of the HVCCC. The maintenance alignment process at the HVCCC is supported by a model of the system capacity, which quantifies the impact of maintenance activities on the system. This was originally achieved with the assistance of a manual model created in Microsoft Excel, which used as input the impact of each maintenance activity on key assets in the HVCC in terms of the reduction in tonnes per hour that the asset could handle. This was further developed by HVCCC in-house to the current production application known as the Annual Capacity Model (ACM), written in Microsoft C#. net stored in a Microsoft SQL database with business rules stored in Common Knowledge. This application, whilst fit for purpose, has limited scenario testing capability and no optimisation functionality. These issues were a catalyst for collaboration of the HVCCC with the University of Newcastle, leading to the development of two separate but symbiotic prototype optimisation applications: the Capacity Evaluator and the Maintenance Optimiser. The former builds on the model concepts and logic of the current HVCCC ACM to estimate system capacity for a given maintenance schedule. The latter reschedules maintenance activities so as to maximize system capacity. This paper focusses on the Capacity Evaluator (CE) application, and the recent enhancements to it that have facilitated its adoption. Based on a Linear Programming (LP) model, the CE constructs flows of coal over time so as to maximize total throughput, and offers new features, such as the ability to integrate in-bound and out-bound flows of coal at the terminal stockyards and account for greater complexity in the rail network. However the LP technology also presents new challenges: multiple optimal LP solutions mean that minor changes in input data can result in major variations in patterns of flow observed in the solutions. This paper reports on how this challenge was converted to an opportunity: flexibility in optimal solutions is exploited in a multiobjective approach to achieve flows consistent with contractual targets, while sacrificing little or nothing in terms of throughput. Both the mathematical modelling and decision support processes needed to achieve this, and to ensure the tool is fit for purpose, are described...|$|E
40|$|The development, structure, {{and content}} of a social survey {{questionnaire}} designed to determine human responses to vibration in residential environments are presented. The overall aim of the questionnaire was to obtain responses that could be combined with vibration measurements so as to investigate dose-response relationships for vibration in residential buildings. The questionnaire seeks to obtain information on how the vibration is perceived in residential environments and encompasses common sources of vibration outside the control of residents (e. <b>g.,</b> from road, <b>rail,</b> industrial, construction operations). Methods of analysing responses obtained with the questionnaire are summarised...|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} of the friction heat generation {{has become increasingly}} important in product design process including areas such as electronics, automotive, aerospace, railway (e. <b>g.</b> wheel and <b>rail</b> rolling contact, braking systems, and so on), medical industries, etc. Determination of generated friction heat in the contact of wheel and rail is important for understanding the damage mechanisms on these two bodies such as wear. This paper presents a method to determine the friction generated heat in contact of wheel and rail during normal operation using transient structural-thermal analysis in ANSYS software...|$|R
40|$|Rail joints are a weak {{component}} in railway tracks {{because of the}} large impact and wheel-rail contact forces. Every train passage contributes to the deterioration of rail joints, causing visible (e. <b>g.</b> battered <b>rails)</b> and invisible (e. g. loose bolts) damages. The invisible damage cannot be detected by the commonly performed visual inspection, which is labor intensive, unreliable, intrusive and unsafe. In this paper, a vehicle-borne monitoring system is used to automatically detect and assess the tightness condition of bolts at rail joints. The monitoring method is developed based on field Axle Box Acceleration (ABA) measurements using different bolt tightness conditions. The suitability of the method is assessed by bolt tightness prediction and verification of a set of rail joints in the tram network of Sheffield, United Kingdom. The results show that ABA system can be employed to monitor bolt tightness conditions at rail joints. With this information better planning for selective preventive maintenance actions can be taken over rail joints. Railway Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 25 {{percent of}} the budget for the {{maintenance}} and renewal of railway tracks –in Switzerland more than a billion Swiss Francs– is used for the switches (points) and crossings (S&C). While in the mean time the budget expenditure for the maintenance and renewal of plain track is optimized with e. g. the help of decision support systems, for S&C this optimisation stays rather rudimentary. One of the identified causes thereof is the lack of insight in the degradation and deterioration process of S&C. This study therefore combined several databases of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS). Statistical analyses are carried out on them to retrieve the lifetime expectancy of complete railway switches (points) & crossings and their respective components, e. <b>g.</b> point <b>rails,</b> stock rails, frog. The expected lifetimes are attributed to different parameters which influence the speed of geometrical degradation or wear of the material, e. g. total train loads (expressed in cumulative tonnages), axle loads, the main direction of the trains, the speed {{and the quality of the}} foundation...|$|R
