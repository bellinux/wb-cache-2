40|$|The {{security}} of biometric data {{is a very}} important issue in the deployment of biometric-based recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a signature-based biometric authentication system, where signal processing techniques are applied to the acquired on-line signature in order to generate protected templates, from which retrieving the original data is computationally as hard as randomly guessing them. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) -based matching strategy is employed to compare the transformed signatures. The proposed protected authentication system generates a score {{as the result of the}} matching process, thus allowing to implement protected multibiometric recognition systems, through the application of score-fusion techniques. The experimental results show that, at the cost of only a slight performance reduction, the <b>desired</b> <b>protection</b> for the employed biometric templates can be properly achieved. 1...|$|E

Widespread use of personal communications devices has only increased demand for a level of security on previously insecure communications. This paper presents a novel low-cost architecture for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm utilizing a field programmable gate array (FPGA). In as much as possible, this architecture uses a bit-serial approach, and it is also suitable for VLSI implementations. In this implementation, the primary objective was not to increase throughput or decrease latency, but to balance these factors in order to lower the cost. A focus on low cost resulted in a design well-suited for SoC implementations. This allows for scaling of the architecture towards vulnerable portable and cost-sensitive communications devices in consumer and military applications. Facultad de Informátic...|$|R

This paper compares the classes of privacy protection goals (which express <b>desired</b> <b>protection</b> of consumer privacy rights) and vulnerabilities (which potentially threaten consumer privacy) with consumer privacy values. For this study, we looked at privacy policies from nearly 50 websites and surveyed over 1000 Internet users.

Our findings suggest several implications to privacy managers and software project managers. Results from this study can help managers determine the kinds of policies needed to both satisfy user values and ensure privacy-aware website development efforts.
