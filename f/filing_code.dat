A deployment diagram is used to give the <b>code</b> <b>files</b> related to the interfaces. Here, the <b>code</b> <b>files</b> describing the OCP interfaces already exist in the Gaspard 2 library. So, we only need to make a link to those <b>files.</b> The <b>code</b> of the internal operations of the estimators is already in the library. The paths to these <b>code</b> <b>files</b> are specified in the deployment diagram so that the generated SystemC estimators include them in their headers. Thus, for the internal operations, the estimator only has to call the functions related to those operations.|$|R
