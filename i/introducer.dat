5|$|Yaoi and Yuri (also {{known as}} Boys' Love and Girls' Love, respectively) are Japanese genres {{incorporating}} homosexual romance themes across various media. The genres {{emerged in the}} 1970s in a branch of manga aimed at girls. Yaoi and yuri have spread beyond Japan: both translated and original yaoi and yuri are now available in many countries and languages. The characters in yaoi and yuri manga do not tend to self-identify as homosexual or bisexual. Famous works include Hiizuredokoro no Tenshi (The Angel that Came from the Sun), an 11-volume series beginning in 1980 that reinterprets {{the life of the}} <b>introducer</b> of Buddhism to Japan; and Kaze to Ki no Uta (Poem of the Wind and the Trees), a 17-volume series beginning in 1976 that chronicles the relationship between two schoolboys in France.|$|E

In 1949, Macintosh published a case report describing the novel use of a gum elastic urinary catheter as an endotracheal tube <b>introducer</b> to facilitate difficult tracheal intubation. Inspired by Macintosh's report, P.

The material of Venn's design was different from that of a gum elastic bougie in that it had two layers: a core of tube woven from polyester threads and an outer resin layer.

Other differences were the length (the new <b>introducer</b> was , which is much longer than the gum elastic bougie) and the presence of a 35° curved tip, permitting it to be steered around obstacles.|$|E

500|$|The Eschmann {{tracheal}} tube <b>introducer</b> (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a [...] "gum elastic bougie") is specialized type of stylet used to facilitate difficult intubation. This flexible device is [...] in length, 15 French (5mm diameter) with a small [...] "hockey-stick" [...] angle at the far end. Unlike a traditional intubating stylet, the Eschmann {{tracheal tube}} <b>introducer</b> is typically inserted directly into the trachea and then used as a guide over which the endotracheal tube can be passed (in a manner analogous to the Seldinger technique). As the Eschmann tracheal tube <b>introducer</b> is considerably less rigid than a conventional stylet, this technique {{is considered to be a}} relatively atraumatic means of tracheal intubation.|$|E

Like May and Pratt, he popularised a style of country house amongst the nobility, encouraging the move away from the traditional [...] "tower house", which came to be perceived as increasingly anachronistic, towards a more continental, leisure-oriented architecture. Sir John Clerk of Penicuik named Bruce as [...] "the chief <b>introducer</b> of architecture in this country", while to Colen Campbell, compiler of Vitruvius Britannicus, he was [...] "justly esteem'd the best Architect of his time in that Kingdom". His work was a major influence on the design of country houses in the 18th century, an influence which was spread through the masons and draughtsmen he worked with, including Mylne and Bauchop, James Smith, and Alexander Edward. At Kinross his deliberate alignment of the main vista on the ruins of Lochleven Castle suggested to Howard Colvin [...] "that Bruce, like Vanbrugh, has a place in the prehistory of the picturesque".|$|E

Thus the god of beginning is not structurally reducible to a sovereign god, nor the goddess of ending to any of the three categories on to which the goddesses are distributed. There is though a greater degree of fuzziness concerning the function and role of goddesses, which may have formed a preexisting structure allowing the absorption of the local Mediterranean mother goddesses, nurturers and protectresses [...]|$|E

40|$|Tracheal tube <b>introducers</b> and stylets {{are highly}} {{successful}} devices {{for the management}} of various airway scenarios. Their first-line use is advocated in many difficult airway algorithms. Although they have been used for decades, the shape and design of <b>introducers</b> and stylets as well as their patterns of use are constantly evolving. Our purpose is to provide the clinician with an update on these different devices. We performed a systematic literature search from 2005 until May 2015, without language restrictions. The two authors independently retrieved all studies with the keywords "bougie", "gum elastic bougie", "stylet", "airway management", "tracheal tube introducer" and "extubation catheter". Our search did yield mostly observational and retrospective studies with small case numbers. The data was synthesized into a narrative review to provide the clinician with an update on the characteristics, indications and techniques of use as well as the dangers of different intubation aids. Today, numerous tracheal tube <b>introducers</b> and stylets exist with different indications, ranging from general to specific situations.

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundRadial artery {{occlusion}} (RAO) is a clinically silent {{complication of}} transradial catheterization but may predispose to hand ischemia. Factors {{associated with this}} complication are the diameter of catheters and sheaths, the dose of heparin, repeated transradial procedures {{and the type of}} compressive dressing applied. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate if there is an association between reused hydrophilic vascular <b>introducers</b> and RAO. MethodsPatients undergoing transradial catheterization were randomized to receive brand new <b>introducers</b> (Group I – GI) or reprocessed <b>introducers</b> (Group II – GII). The presence of RAO was evaluated at 24 hours (early) and day 30 (late) with the reverse Barbeau test. ResultsTwo hundred and twenty-eight patients were assigned to GI (n= 100) and GII (n= 128). Mean age was 60. 1 ± 10. 6 years vs. 59. 4 ± 10. 9 years (P= 0. 64), 49 % vs. 35. 2 % (P= 0. 03) were female and 25 % vs. 27. 3 % (P= 0. 70) were diabetic. An total early RAO incidence of 10. 5 % and a late RAO incidence of 9. 1 % were observed. Ten GI patients (10 %) had early RAO when compared to 14 (19. 9 %) in GII (χ 2 = 0. 05; HR: 1. 09; P= 0. 82). On the 30 -day follow-up RAO was observed in 6 GI patients (7. 5 %) when compared to 11 GII patients (10. 4 %) (χ 2 = 0. 45; HR= 1. 38; P= 0. 50).
