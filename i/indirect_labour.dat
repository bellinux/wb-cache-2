The amount of labour so required is called the direct labour input into the commodity. Yet the required capital goods have in their turn been produced (in the past) by labour and other capital goods; and so on for these other capital goods, and so on. The sum of all the amounts of labour, that were direct inputs into this backwards-stretching series of capital goods produced in the past, is called the <b>indirect</b> <b>labour</b> input into the commodity.

The findings show differences in both sets of firms. Firms with lower than average costs have reduced their employee levels over the past three years, which is reflected in their reduced direct labour costs, arguably as a result of increased contracting out of activities. The lower than average costs translate into the ability to offer competitive pricing and increased market share.

While pre-colonial Luba identity was plural and fluid, those located in the polity’s heartlands shared a political aesthetic of divine kingship embodied in a rich material culture, which was emulated by neighbouring communities as marker of sophistication and civilisation. Under Belgian colonialism the scale and variety of Luba ethnic identity was limited by <b>indirect</b> rule, <b>labour</b> migration and the creation ethnic taxonomies. In the latter case, new categories of Luba were created by missionary work in ethnography, linguistics, collecting and photography, and these became the basis of linguistic zones for the production of vernacular scriptures and other Christian texts. Biblical literacy was spread by re-gathered ex-slave diaspora and young male Christian enthusiasts via an infrastructure of mission stations and schools in a spirit of grass roots ecumenism and had great appeal amongst labour migrants. The process was aided by the adoption of portable cyclostyled print technology by missionary societies. The article finishes by examining how the Luba cultural project became a political one as local intellectuals, Jason Sendwe and Bonaventure Makonga, sought to turn ethnic communities into political constituencies.

Optimization of manpower and forecasting manpower needs in a modern fab is an essential part of the future strategic planing and a very important to the operational efficiency. As the semiconductor manufacturing technology has entered the 8 -inch wafer era, the complexity of fab operation increases with the increase of wafer size. The wafer handling method has evolved from manual mode in 6 -inch wafer fab to semi-automated or fully automated factory in 8 -inch and 12 -inch wafer fab. The dis-tribution of manpower requirement in each specialty varied as the trend of fab operation goes for downsizing manpower with automation and outsourcing maintenance work. This paper is to study the specialty distribution of manpower from the requirement in a typical 6 -inch, 8 -inch to 12 -inch wafer fab. The human resource planning in today’s fab operation shall consider many factors, which include the stability of technical talents. This empirical study mainly focuses on the human resource planning, the manpower distribution of specialty structure and the forecast model of internal demand/supply in current semiconductor manufacturing company.

40|$|Wassa in {{southwest}} Ghana was {{the location of}} the largest mining sector in colonial British West Africa. The gold mines provide an excellent case study of how labour was mobilised for large-scale production immediately after the legal end of slavery, {{in the context of an}} expansive independent labour market. Divided into three sections, this thesis examines the practice of <b>indirect</b> <b>labour</b> recruitment for the mines during the formative years of colonial rule; the incorporation of ‘traditional’ credit relationships into ‘modern’ commerce. The starting point for this study is the analysis of precolonial strategies for mobilising labour. Part one examines the most pervasive and coercive employer-employee relationship in precolonial West Africa, namely the master-slave relationship. Even enslaved Africans could expect individual economic opportunity, and related to such, debt protection, and the power of labourers increased significantly after abolition. Starting in the 1870 s, mine management found that the most effective way of recruiting long-term wage earners was through headmen; African authorities who established temporary patronage relationships with a group of labourers by offering them credit. Moreover, administrative and court records indicate that there were various forms of headship, some which the mines managed to impose greater regulation over than others. Therefore, part two demonstrates that issues of cost and control of recruitment differed depending on whether the labour recruiter had been furnished with the capital of a mining firm to conduct his business, whether he had done so with his own personal savings, or whether he was in the employment of the colonial government. Finally, part three takes a comparative look at headship and recruitment through rural chiefs, which began in 1906; two successive forms of non-free wage labour mobilisation. In 1909, mine management reverted to the headship system that many colonial commentators regarded as being more compatible with the colonial political order, albeit under considerably stricter regulations.

40|$|This paper {{engages in}} a {{critical}} {{review of the literature}} on labour market rigidities, developing a simple theoretical schema that allows unitary treatment of the different issues. It finds little theoretical or empirical support for a simple equation linking rigidities with unemployment. Nevertheless, the degree of rigidity does influence the dynamic, composition and duration of unemployment, with significant implications for the labour market, unemployment and the efficiency of the economy as a whole. It is therefore important to study the <b>indirect</b> effects of <b>labour</b> market rigidity and broaden the concept of rigidity to other aspects of the economic system. Accordingly, the paper analyzes the interaction between legislation and the protection of employed workers and wage determination, the effects of setting uniform wages across regions with differing productivity in a context of geographical immobility, and the consequences for capital formation and growth of the inefficient allocation of labour induced by a rigid system. The analysis shows that these aspects help to explain the disappointing performance of the European labour market in the last three decades, above and beyond the direct effects of restrictions on layoffs. ...|$|R

This approach allows us to disentangle the observable direct and indirect effects of truancy and test scores on the risk of unemployment and NEET from their unobserved effects. We use a unique data source, combining the Youth Cohort Study, the School Performance Tables, and the School’s Census, enabling us to control for a large number of personal, family, school, peer group and neighbourhood effects on the three response variables. Our findings suggest that models of the determinants of youth unemployment and NEET that ignore correlation between the unobservables of the determinants test scores and truancy will lead to misleading inference about the magnitude and strength of their direct effects.

Basic criteria to determinate internal ecological and economical losses from soils’ contamination are losses of profit whose obtaining is the main goal of the enterprise performance in marketing conditions. Major constituents of internal ecological and economical loss incurred by an agrarian enterprise are: losses of profit due to obtaining less products than expected, because of shortage of crop yield through contamination of soils; losses of profit due to deteriorated qualityof agricultural produce through contamination of soils; losses of enterprise profits due to increase of product unit-cost through declined labour productivity, predefined by reduction of crop-yield productivity at the same rates of semi-fixed expenditures.
