25|$|Takeover paper. Convertibles have a {{place as}} the {{currency}} used in takeovers. The bidder can offer a higher income on a convertible than the <b>dividend</b> <b>yield</b> on a bid victim’s shares, without having to raise the <b>dividend</b> <b>yield</b> on all the bidder’s shares. This eases the process for a bidder with low-yield shares acquiring a company with higher-yielding shares. Perversely, the lower the yield on the bidder’s shares, {{the easier it is}} for the bidder to create a higher conversion premium on the convertible, with consequent benefits for the mathematics of the takeover. In the 1980s, UK domestic convertibles accounted for about 80pct of the European convertibles market, and over 80pct of these were issued either as takeover currency or as funding for takeovers. They had several cosmetic attractions.|$|E
25|$|The {{equations}} used {{to model}} the option are often expressed as partial differential equations (see for example Black–Scholes equation). Once expressed in this form, a finite difference model can be derived, and the valuation obtained. A number of implementations of finite difference methods exist for option valuation, including: explicit finite difference, implicit finite difference and the Crank-Nicholson method. A trinomial tree option pricing model can {{be shown to be}} a simplified application of the explicit finite difference method. Although the finite difference approach is mathematically sophisticated, it is particularly useful where changes are assumed over time in model inputs– for example <b>dividend</b> <b>yield,</b> risk free rate, or volatility, or some combination of these– that are not tractable in closed form.|$|E
40|$|Existing {{empirical}} studies of <b>dividend</b> <b>yields</b> and <b>dividend</b> policies either make no assumption or the normal {{distribution of the}} <b>dividend</b> <b>yields</b> data. The statistical results will be biased because they cannot reflect the finite support set property of <b>dividend</b> <b>yields</b> which can only range from 0 to 1. We posit that the assumption that <b>dividend</b> <b>yields</b> follow a beta distribution is more appropriate. The coefficient of variation (CV) is {{used to measure the}} stability of <b>dividend</b> <b>yields.</b> If we assume <b>dividend</b> <b>yields</b> follow a normal distribution, then the maximum likelihood estimate for coefficient of variation is given by frac(s, over(x, ̄)). This only gives us a point estimate, which cannot depict the full picture of the sampling distribution of the coefficient of variation. A simulation-based approach is adopted to estimate CV under the beta distribution. This approach will give us a point estimate as well as the empirical sampling distribution of CV. With this approach, we study the stability of <b>dividend</b> <b>yields</b> of the Hang Seng index and its sub-indexes of the Hong Kong stock market and compare the results with the traditional approach.

40|$|This paper aims to test an {{important}} hypothesis in 8 ̆ 5 nancial economics: whether equity returns are predictable over various horizons? The conventional wisdom {{in the literature}} is that aggregate <b>dividend</b> <b>yields</b> strongly predict excess returns, and the predictability is stronger at longer horizons (Fama and French (1988), Campbell (1991), and Cochrane (1992)). In contrast, Ang and Bekaert (2007) 8 ̆ 5 nd that <b>dividend</b> <b>yields,</b> together with the short rate, predict excess returns only at short horizons, {{and do not have}} any long-horizon predictive power. In this paper, we undertake an analysis of both in-sample and out-of-sample tests of equity return predictability to better understand the empirical evidence on return predictability over di¤erent time horizons. We 8 ̆ 5 rst propose a nonparametric test to examine the predictability of equity returns, which can be interpreted as a signal-to-noise ratio test.

40|$|A {{potential}} {{explanation for}} the time-series predictability of market returns with <b>dividend</b> <b>yields</b> is the differential tax treatment of capital gains and dividends.

We also compare the predictability of before-tax long-horizon returns with that of after-tax returns. The results indicate that the tax treatment of dividends does not significantly contribute towards the predictability of stock returns. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B. V.
