While {{the rear}} frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Men in Black: Alien Attacks development, Universal Creative were {{installing}} two new dark ride systems at the neighbouring Islands of Adventure theme park. The first system was designed for The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and was manufactured by Oceaneering International. It featured track-mounted motion bases with six <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom that were able to tour physical sets and allow riders to view 3D projections. The second system was developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The Cat in the Hat. This system was simpler, offering track-mounted spinning platforms, with no additional <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom. The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider-Man ride system; however, when shooting tests were performed on the ride, the vast motion of the vehicles {{made it impossible for}} riders to achieve a reasonable score. As a result, The Cat in the Hat system was selected for the MIB attraction.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the planet}} is {{predicted}} to be visible in the Northern Hemisphere, the primary search {{is expected to be}} carried out using the Subaru Telescope, which has both an aperture large enough to see faint objects and a wide field of view to shorten the search. Two teams of astronomers—Batygin and Brown, as well as Trujillo and Sheppard—are undertaking this search together, and both teams cooperatively expect the search to take up to five years. Brown and Batygin initially narrowed the search for Planet Nine down to roughly 2,000 square <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> sky near Orion, a swath of space, that in Batygin's opinion, could be covered in about 20 nights by the Subaru Telescope. Subsequent refinements by Batygin and Brown have reduced the search space to 600–800 square <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> sky.|$|E
