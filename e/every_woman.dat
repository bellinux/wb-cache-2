5|$|I'm {{giving you}} an example of how I think <b>every</b> <b>woman</b> should feel about herself. No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the United Nations {{launched}} the <b>Every</b> <b>Woman</b> Every Child movement {{to assess the}} progress toward meeting women's contraceptive needs. The initiative has {{set a goal of}} increasing the number of users of modern birth control by 120 million women in the world's 69 poorest countries by the year 2020. Additionally, they aim to eradicate discrimination against girls and young women who seek contraceptives. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended in 2014 that oral birth control pills should be over the counter medications.|$|E

5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those moments that <b>every</b> <b>woman</b> kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} over my son with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't {{want to go out}} for dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew in the care of their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, <b>every</b> <b>woman</b> I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E
5|$|South Africa {{have played}} twelve Test matches, seven {{of which were}} played pre-exclusion, and five of them post-exclusion. Two players, Jennifer Gove and Lorna Ward, have played all seven matches pre-exclusion. Yvonne van Mentz, Brenda Williams and Mignon du Preez are the only South African women to have scored Test centuries, while Jean McNaughton, Lorna Ward and Sunette Loubser have all taken five-wicket hauls, with Ward doing it on three occasions. This list {{contains}} <b>every</b> <b>woman</b> who has played Test cricket for South Africa. The list is initially arranged in {{the order in which}} each player won her Test cap. Where more than one player won her first Test cap in the same Test match, those players are initially listed alphabetically by the surname the player was using {{at the time of the}} match.|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Moshe Feinstein {{wrote that}} {{permission}} is granted to <b>every</b> <b>woman</b> {{who wishes to}} fulfill even those mitzvot which the Torah did not obligate; and they indeed fulfill a mitzvah and receive the reward for the fulfilment of it including saying the appropriate associated blessing (as with shofar, lulav etc.).

Lori Perkins), a parody called Fifty Sheds of Grey and editors of erotic {{imprints}} re-evaluating the content and presentation of the genre.|$|E

25|$|A belt {{could also}} be {{fastened}} over a simple tunic-like garment or undergarment, just below the breasts or over the breasts. When the apodesmos was worn under the breasts, it accentuated them. Another word for a breast-band or belt was strophion (Gr: στρόφιον). A further term was kestós (Gr: κεστός, Latin: cestus), used specifically for Aphrodite's charmed girdle in the Iliad, whose power was to make <b>every</b> <b>woman</b> who wore it irresistible to men. In view of its association with the love goddess, this type of garment probably had an erotic connotation because of its effect to accentuate the breast.|$|E
25|$|The Forum did not, however, list this {{information}} for Afghanistan, Iraq, or Tunisia. It {{is probable that}} the ratios are small given the low labor force participation rate of women in these countries and high unemployment rates, but given the uncertain correlation between female labor force participation rate and the ratio of male to female workers, this cannot be stated with any certainty. One {{possible explanation for the}} seeming discrepancy is the ratio of females to males in the population. In Syria, for <b>every</b> <b>woman</b> between the ages of 15 and 65, there are 1.03 males.|$|E
25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} in a proto-fascist ballroom where {{gigantic}} torchieres gripped by fists recall those of Jean Cocteau's La Belle et la Bête. It commences {{with the arrival of the}} Queen and the Prince and some formal dancing, but quickly degenerates into a debauched party of drinking and lascivious come-ons. Into this arrives the charismatic and sexually aggressive son of von Rothbart, the Private Secretary, in black leather pants, who intensifies the sexual tension even further by flirting with <b>every</b> <b>woman</b> present, including the Queen. Each woman finds herself drawn to him and actively participates in the mutual, sometimes lewd, flirtation.|$|E

25|$|The {{view that}} Juno was the {{feminine}} counterpart to Genius, i.e. that as men possess a tutelary entity or double named genius, so women {{have their own}} one named juno, has been maintained by many scholars, lastly Kurt Latte. In the past {{it has also been}} argued that goddess Juno herself would be the issue of a process of abstraction from the individual junos of <b>every</b> <b>woman.</b> According to Georg Wissowa and K. Latte Genius (from the root gen-, whence gigno bear or be born, archaic also geno) would design the specific virile generative potency, as opposed to feminine nature, reflected in conception and delivery, under the tutelage of Juno Lucina. Such an interpretation has been critically reviewed by Walter F. Otto.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} some correspondences between the ideas about genius and juno, {{especially}} in the imperial age, the relevant documentation is rather late (Tibullus mentions it first). Dumézil also remarks from these passages one could infer <b>every</b> <b>woman</b> has a Venus too. As evidence of the antiquity {{of the concept of}} a juno of women, homologous to the genius of men, is the Arval sacrifice of two sheep to the Juno Deae Diae ("the juno of goddesses named Dea Dia"), in contrast to their sacrifice of two cows sacrificed to Juno (singular). However both G. Wissowa and K. Latte allow that this ritual could have been adapted to fit theology of the Augustan restoration. While the concept of a Juno of goddesses is not attested in the inscriptions of 58 BC from Furfo, that of a Genius of gods is, and even of a Genius of a goddess, Victoria. On this point it looks remarkable that also in Martianus Capella's division of Heaven a Juno Hospitae Genius is mentioned in region IX, and not a Juno: the sex of this Genius is feminine. See section below for details.|$|E
