50|$|The Naval Research Laboratory {{has been}} a crucial piece of the United States space program. Project Vanguard, the first American {{satellite}} program, tasked NRL with the design, construction and launch of an artificial satellite, which was accomplished in 1958. Vanguard I, designed and built at NRL, was the first solar-powered satellite. As of 2013, Vanguard I is still in orbit, making it the longest-lived man-made satellite. Vanguard II was the first satellite to observe the Earth's cloud cover and therefore the first meteorological satellite. NRL pioneered {{the study of the}} sun Ultraviolet and X-Ray spectrum. Along with Project Vanguard, NRL also designed the first satellite tracking system, Minitrack, which became the prototype for future satellite tracking networks. NRL's recently declassified Galactic Radiation and Background <b>I</b> (<b>GRAB</b> I) was the first U.S. intelligence satellite, intercepting Soviet radio communications from space. The Global Positioning System (GPS) was invented at NRL and tested by NRL prototype satellites Timation I and Timation II in 1967 and 1969, and the first operational GPS satellite, Timation IV (NTS-II) was designed and constructed at NRL.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origins of}} this {{sculpture}} {{are in the}} early object-sculptures the artist made in Mont-roig del Camp with found objects. The objects found were gathered at his workshop and then shaped into the artist's new world. At first, the objects were not placed in the right place; once the creation started there was a rigorous evaluation of their position by the artist. During the second world war, Miró was alone in his ancestral home and landscape in Mont-roig del Camp. He was excluded from his artistic peers {{and the influence of}} art galleries, museums and exhibitions. He extracted natural forms and elements into a new artistic language of found art. Joan Prats, Miró's lifelong friend and collaborator said: [...] "When I take a stone, it is just a stone. When <b>I</b> <b>grab</b> a stone, it is a Miró." [...] In the mid 60s it was realised that the original sculpture was deteriorating and it was re-created in bronze by founders in Paris. Miró himself supervised the texture and controlled patina which he considered to be very important.|$|E
40|$|Instruments for the {{measurements}} of radon and its decay products in earthquake research are based {{mostly on the}} detection of alpha particles. The devices and methods used depend on whether the techniques measure radon or radon decay products, and the duration of {{the measurements}}, of which there are three types: <b>i)</b> <b>grab</b> or instantaneous, ii) integrating and iii) continuous. Other criteria used in the design of these instruments are field measurements applicability, portability, convenience and reliability. With the recent increased demand for radon and radon decay products measurements, instruments development has focused on the design of appropriate devices for short-term measurements, as well as on more complex and sophisticated instruments for long-term measurements used in radon research for geophysical, geochemical and hydrological studies...|$|E
