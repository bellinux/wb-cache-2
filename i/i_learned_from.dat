500|$|Squidward's {{voice has}} been {{compared}} to that of Jack Benny's. Kenny said, [...] "To me, there's something just so funny about that Jack-Benny-loyal-to-nobody character that Rodger Bumpass does such a great job of playing [...] Squidward". Arthur Brown, author of Everything I Need to Know, <b>I</b> <b>Learned</b> <b>from</b> Cartoons!, said that Squidward [...] "sounds a lot like Jack Benny". Bumpass repudiated the relationship, saying [...] "Jack Benny, no. Although he does have this observational sarcasm he occasionally brought out." ...|$|E
500|$|Hannah Montana {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who appreciated its overall production. Writing for AllMusic, Heather Phares enjoyed Cyrus' deliveries of [...] "cute, well-written songs", {{and added that}} the overall project was [...] "sweet, starry-eyed, [...] utterly charming". Jennifer Axman from Common Sense Media shared a similar sentiment, appreciating its [...] "upbeat girl-power messages" [...] and distinguishing [...] "I Learned from You" [...] as a stand-out track for its inspirational lyrics ("I learned from you that I do not crumble / <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> you that strength is something you choose /.../ There is no question that's a lesson <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> you"). MSN Music gave the record a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and listed it as an [...] "essential album". However, Chris Willman provided a more mixed review, commenting that Cyrus appeared to [...] "mimic Avril, Ashlee, and Britney simultaneously", and felt {{that the concept of}} leading a double life was [...] "a nice fantasy for Brangelina, but a weird one to push on little girls." [...] David Hiltbrand was also critical of the record, stating that its [...] "generic pop" [...] would irritate adult listeners, but acknowledged that it was [...] "slickly executed" [...] for appealing to its younger audience.|$|E

[...] Then later, in an obituary written for the French composer in the same year, Takemitsu further expressed his sense of loss at Messiaen's death: [...] "Truly, he was my spiritual mentor... Among the many things <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> his music, the concept and experience of color and the form of time will be unforgettable." [...] The composition Rain Tree Sketch II, {{which was to be}} Takemitsu's final piano piece, was also written that year and subtitled [...] "In Memoriam Olivier Messiaen".|$|E
500|$|Zakuani {{played for}} the Arsenal youth academy but as a {{teenager}} he struggled finding a team. He attended the University of Akron on a soccer scholarship and excelled as a forward. In 2009, Seattle selected Zakuani first overall in the MLS SuperDraft. He quickly became a fan favorite as a winger who had the speed and ability to take on opposing defenders. He had success in 2010, scoring ten goals and debuting for the Congo DR national football team in a friendly. However, in 2011, he suffered a leg injury that almost ended his career. He returned in 2012 but failed to recapture his early success, and retired after playing the 2014 MLS season with the Portland Timbers. After his retirement from soccer, Zakuani has pursued helping young athletes through charity work. He has also joined the Sounders' game-day broadcast team and published the memoir [...] "500 Days: What <b>I</b> <b>Learned</b> <b>From</b> the Moment That Changed Everything" [...] (2015).|$|E
500|$|Aguilera {{revealed}} {{that some of}} the inspiration for the music video came from her work in Burlesque, stating, [...] "There is dancing, and I learned so much also as a dancer doing the 'Burlesque' film, moving my body in ways that were, I feel, never as precise before [...] I really fell in love and I adapted that in the dancing for 'Not Myself Tonight,' but it was really, really fun to take what <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> the movie." [...] She further elaborated, [...] "A lot of that [...] was based on my visual inspiration. I took Hype into my salon area in my home ... it's like my creative den. He took the ideas and then took other ideas and related to the ideas, and it just was really iconic imagery." [...] The video itself features a strong sexual theme with scenes of S and bondage, as well as scenes in a church and several prestigious-looking buildings. Aguilera wore several hairstyles and outfits, including many which were dominatrix-style.|$|E

500|$|Maryland {{head coach}} Ralph Friedgen played as an {{offensive}} guard under Ward, {{and was one}} of the players who remained on the team when 40 of his teammates walked off in protest. Long after the events, Friedgen said [...] "he was a tough coach...If he had addressed some of the players' concerns, I don't know that so many would have left...One of the things <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> him was to surround myself with good assistants, and I don't know if he necessarily did that." [...] Kehoe, who had been one of Ward's track coaches in college, said, [...] "I think Bob's problem was that he expected his players to play and hustle the same way he had, and times had changed." [...] After Maryland, Ward took a job as an assistant coach with the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League in 1969, and later coached for the Montreal Alouettes, from 1970 to 1971, and the Toronto Argonauts from 1975 to 1976. He remained in Canada for the remainder of his coaching career.|$|E
500|$|Squidward Tentacles is {{voiced by}} Rodger Bumpass, who {{describes}} Squidward as [...] "a very nasally, monotone kind of guy." [...] He {{said that the}} character [...] "became a very interesting character to do" [...] because of [...] "his sarcasm, and then his frustration, and then his apoplexy, and so he became {{a wide spectrum of}} emotions". Arthur Brown, author of Everything I Need to Know, <b>I</b> <b>Learned</b> <b>from</b> Cartoons!, has compared Squidward's voice to that of Jack Benny's, a similarity Bumpass says is mostly unintentional. Voice acting veteran Clancy Brown voices Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob's boss at the Krusty Krab. Hillenburg modeled Mr. Krabs after his former manager at a seafood restaurant, whose strong Maine accent reminded Hillenburg of a pirate. For the character, Brown decided to use a [...] "piratey" [...] voice with [...] "a little Scottish brogue" [...] after hearing Hillenburg's description of his boss. According to Brown, his Mr. Krabs voice was mostly improvised during his audition and it was not challenging for him to find the correct voice.|$|E
500|$|Even {{though the}} show was set in Miami, filming took place at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Stock {{exterior}} shots of Miami {{were used for the}} opening credits and transitions between scenes. The series was filmed with a multiple-camera setup, with each episode last roughly 20 to 22 minutes excluding commercials. Eve said she was initially intimidated by the amount of work required to prepare for and film a television series. During an interview with Billboard, she explained that while filming the first season she felt like she [...] "just wanted to leave because there was so much to learn, it's just a different world". Since she found comedy to be challenging due to the [...] "certain beats you have to learn", Eve hired two acting coaches to help improve her timing. One of her coaches was Chip Fields, who visited the show's set to offer Eve acting advice. During the development of the second season, Eve viewed the set as her home, and felt the process was easier, having grown closer to the cast and crew. In a 2016 interview with Grazia, she revealed her regret at not fully committing herself to her character and the series. She explained: [...] "I was the youngest person on set and was clubbing in between being on set and learning my lines. I look back and wish I was more dedicated. But <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{director}} {{has worked with}} screenwriter David S. Goyer on all his comic-book adaptations. Wally Pfister was the cinematographer for all of Nolan's films from Memento to The Dark Knight Rises. Embarking on his own career as a director, Pfister said: [...] "The greatest lesson <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> Chris Nolan is to keep my humility. He is an absolute gentleman on set and he is wonderful to everyone â€” from the actors to the entire crew, he treats everyone with respect." [...] Lee Smith has been Nolan's editor since Batman Begins, with Dody Dorn editing Memento and Insomnia. David Julyan composed the music for Nolan's early work, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard provided the music for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Zimmer scored The Dark Knight Rises, and has worked with Nolan on his subsequent films. Zimmer has said his creative relationship with Nolan is highly collaborative, and that he views Nolan as [...] "the co-creator of the score". The {{director has}} worked with sound designer Richard King and sound mixer Ed Novick since The Prestige. Nolan has frequently collaborated with special-effects supervisor Chris Corbould, stunt coordinator Tom Struthers first assistant director Nilo Otero, and visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin. Production designer Nathan Crowley has worked with him since Insomnia (except for Inception). Nolan has called Crowley {{one of his closest}} and most inspiring creative collaborators. Casting director John Papsidera has worked on all of Nolan's films, except Following and Insomnia.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} and release of Neighborhoods was delayed multiple times. The recording's delay {{was due to}} the way the band chose to work â€” in bits and pieces, alone and together, in a pair of California studios â€” in addition to each member's busy schedules. The album was recorded at both DeLonge's studio in San Diego and in Los Angeles by Hoppus and Barker. [...] Recording in separate studios was DeLonge's idea, and ideas were exchanged via e-mail. Various engineers met up in person to trade files on hard drives. Although the three musicians were rarely in the same room while recording, opting to work on their parts individually, DeLonge asserted that the method of recording was a more efficient way of working considering the schedules, not {{due to a lack of}} unity within the band. In addition, Barker was releasing a solo record, DeLonge was involved in Angels & Airwaves, and Hoppus had to fly to New York City once a week to film his television show, Hoppus on Music. The record was the band's first to be self-produced, due to the death of long-time producer Jerry Finn in 2008. Not only did Finn helm their last three studio albums, but he served as an invaluable member of the band: part adviser, part impartial observer, he helped smooth out tensions and hone their sound. [...] "I honestly still feel like heâ€™s in the studio with us, because for me, personally, everything that was about {{recording and}} being in a studio, <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> Jerry," [...] said Hoppus. Instead of a producer, each band member had their own dedicated sound engineer. DeLonge, who was against using a producer after self-producing most of his Angels & Airwaves records, described the band situation as [...] "very democratic," [...] noting that he learned during the recording process to [...] "let go and be okay with not being able to control everything." ...|$|E
500|$|Previous {{series of}} Jonathan Creek had {{featured}} first Caroline Quentin, and then Julia Sawalha as Jonathan's assistants Maddy Magellan and Carla Borrego, respectively. Quentin {{departed from the}} show {{at the end of}} its third series in 2000 in order to try for a second child, while Sawalha temporarily retired from acting in 2004, having become so disillusioned that she was [...] "dragging self out of bed" [...] by the end of the show's fourth series in order to film episodes. Davies explained that Renwick had always believed Jonathan needed a sidekick character, and that: [...] "You can't really have Jonathan Creek without his sounding board when all the stuff is going on in his mind. In a novel you can have an interior monologue when a leading character is working out what's going on, but for a film or television you have to have Dr Watson for Sherlock Holmes, it's somebody for Holmes to explain it to." [...] For [...] "The Grinning Man", a new sidekick was created in the form of Joey Ross, played by actress Sheridan Smith. Renwick described the opportunity to work with Smith as a major catalyst in his decision to revive the show. The actress had previously appeared in his series Love Soup, and Renwick's wife suggested pairing her with Davies in the new episode. Smith was approached about the role before the episode's script was written, and after readily agreeing to take the part of Ross, Renwick wrote the character's dialogue with Smith's northern accent in mind. The actress found accustoming herself to [...] "detective talk" [...] the hardest part of the role, explaining: [...] "You slow down, and then speed up at the end. I kept watching Alan and going, 'I canâ€™t do this figuring out talk.' But <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> the master." [...] Smith enjoyed the challenge the role presented, stating: [...] "He's [...] written this feisty little northern character, and I am really honoured because he's such a great writer. I have always played chavs and slappers so I wasn't used to being an intelligent young girl." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{this time}} Ramblin' Jack Elliott studied {{extensively}} under Guthrie, visiting {{his home and}} observing how he wrote and performed. Elliott, like Bob Dylan later, idolized Guthrie and was inspired by his idiomatic performance style and repertoire. Because of Guthrie's Huntington's disease, Dylan and Guthrie's son Arlo later claimed they learned much of Guthrie's performance style from Elliott. When asked about Arlo's claim, Elliott said, [...] "I was flattered. Dylan learned from me the same way <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> Woody. Woody didn't teach me. He just said, If {{you want to learn}} something, just steal itâ€”that's the way <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> Lead Belly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Levy {{and many}} others have {{supported}} Dylan {{in the context of}} a larger, older blues and folk tradition of songwriters evolving old songs into new ones, which Dylan was no stranger to in the 1960s. Pete Seeger himself has previously expressed the view that Dylan is a link in this chain of folk and blues songwriters. Seeger has spoken many times about the folk process, often recounting that his friend Woody Guthrie once said to him [...] "That guy stole that from me, but I steal from everybody". Ramblin' Jack at one time expressed similar sentiments: [...] "Dylan learned from me the same way <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> Woody. Woody didn't teach me.
