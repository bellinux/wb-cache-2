To the east of Mesopotamia lay the powerful kingdom of Elam which regularly invaded and forced tribute upon the small states of southern Mesopotamia. In northern Mesopotamia, the Assyrian king Shamshi-Adad I, who had already inherited centuries old Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor, had expanded his territory into the Levant and central Mesopotamia, although his untimely death would somewhat fragment his empire.|$|E

The {{independent}} spirit of the Toubou and the <b>geopolitical</b> <b>situation</b> in the region has complicated the exploration of the range as well as the ascent of its peaks. Tensions continued after Chad and Libya gained independence in the mid-20th century, with hostage-taking and armed struggles occurring amid border disputes over the allocation of natural resources.

After much of the opium and morphine in the US National Stockpile of Strategic & Critical Materials was tapped in order to ease severe shortages of medicinal opiates — the codeine-based antitussives in particular — in late 1973, researchers were tasked with finding a way to synthesize codeine and its derivatives. They quickly succeeded using petroleum or coal tar and a process developed at the United States' National Institutes of Health.|$|E

Minister Beck, disappointed with the lack of recognition, issued an ultimatum on the day of the Munich Agreement to the government of Czechoslovakia, demanding an immediate return to Poland of the contested Zaolzie border region. The distressed Czechoslovak government complied, and Polish military units took over the area. The move was negatively received in the West and contributed to the worsening of the <b>geopolitical</b> <b>situation</b> of Poland. In November, the Polish government also annexed a small border region in dispute with the newly autonomous state of Slovakia and gave its support to Hungary's expansion into Carpatho-Ukraine, located within the now federal Czechoslovakia.|$|E
25|$|Lasting {{for several}} centuries, the kingdom {{fell to the}} Mongol invasions in the 13th century, but managed to re-assert {{sovereignty}} by the 1340s.

The Kingdom's <b>geopolitical</b> <b>situation</b> further worsened {{after the fall of the}} Empire of Trebizond. As a result of these processes, by the end of the 15th century Georgia turned into a fractured entity. Renewed incursions by Timur from 1386, and the later invasions by the Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu led to the final collapse of the kingdom into anarchy by 1466 and the mutual recognition of its constituent kingdoms of Kartli, Kakheti and Imereti as independent states between 1490 and 1493.|$|E

It is, therefore, beneficial to pursue methodological approaches that consider the peculiarities of humanitarian supply chains {{and deal with the}} unpredictability. The purpose of this chapter is to explore the appropriateness of deploying collaborative research approaches in humanitarian logistics and supply chains management. The chapter examines how to ensure the rigour, relevance, and reflectiveness, while adopting two collaborative approaches: action research and clinical inquiry. A collaborative research framework for humanitarian logistics and supply chain management is developed. The framework aims at mitigating the shortcomings of lack of collaboration, as well as helping researchers closing the relevance gap between theoretical studies and real-world events...|$|R

25|$|The fall of {{the last}} Kagan with its capital in Ötüken, which {{dominated}} for three centuries, created a completely new <b>geopolitical</b> <b>situation</b> in all Central Asia. For {{the first time in}} three hundred years, the powerful center of authority that created opportunities for expansion or even existence of any state in Turkestan had finally disappeared. Henceforth, the Turkic tribes recognized only the high status of the clan that inherited the Kagan title, but never again his unifying authority. Several Muslim historians state that after the loss by the Uygurs of their power (840), the supreme authority among the Turkic tribes passed to the Karluk leaders. Connection with the Ashina clan, the ruling clan of the Turkic Kaganate, allowed the Karluk dynasty to dress their authority with legitimate attire, and, abandoning the old title Yabgu, to take on the new title of Kagan.|$|E
25|$|The British {{attacked}} several {{locations in}} the Caribbean with little consequence to the <b>geopolitical</b> <b>situation</b> in the Atlantic. The weakened British forces under Vernon launched an attack against Cuba, landing in Guantánamo Bay {{with a plan to}} march the 45 miles to Santiago de Cuba and capture the city. Vernon clashed with the army commander, and the expedition withdrew when faced with heavier Spanish opposition than expected. Vernon remained in the Caribbean until October 1742, before heading back to Britain; he was replaced by admiral Chaloner Ogle, who took command of a sickly fleet. Less than half the sailors were fit for duty. The following year, a smaller fleet of Royal Navy led by commodore Charles Knowles raided the Venezuelan coast, on 2 March 1743 attacking newly La Guaira controlled by Royal Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas whose ships had rendered great assistance to the Spanish navy during War in carrying troops, arms, stores and ammunition from Spain to her colonies, and its destruction would be a severe blow both to the Company and the Spanish Crown.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{isolation}} and <b>geopolitical</b> <b>situation,</b> the Tibesti Mountains were long unexplored by scientists. The German Gustav Nachtigal, dispatched by Otto von Bismarck, {{was the first}} European to explore, albeit with great difficulty, the Tibesti in 1869. Prior to Nachtigal's expedition, an American along with two missionaries had attempted to enter the Tibesti range, but were killed by a Toubou warrior. While Nachtigal provided an accurate description of the population, his account discouraged any new adventure into the Tibesti for over 40 years, as he was convicted by the Toubou of spying for Bismarck and only released after the intervention of Maï Arami Tetimi. Later expeditions carried out between 1920 and 1970 yielded valuable information on the geology and petrology of the range. The French anthropologist Charles le Cœur and his wife Margaret, a geographer, lived among the Teda of Tibesti between 1933 and 1935. Le Cœur {{was the first to}} closely study the Tibesti populace, but the outbreak of World War II prevented him from publishing his research. French Colonel Jean Chapelle published a book on the Toubou and their lifestyle in 1957. In 1965, the Free University of Berlin opened a geomorphological research station in Bardaï; however, research at the station was interrupted several times due to the Chadian Civil War, and the station was ultimately closed in 1974.|$|E

40|$|It is a truism that film, {{like many}} other visual media, can stimulate and assist the social {{imagination}} of their viewing audiences. At the same time, {{it can also be}} an implement in the toolbox of the cultural journalist. Through textual analysis of Ermo (1994, People’s Republic of China) and Eat, Drink, Man, Woman (1994, Taiwan, Republic of China), we explore how these two films project the concepts of modernity, gender relation and, most of all, the virtues and inflictions of being Chinese. A joint Trans-Chinese imagination emerges through these two separate films, despite the reported political and ideological differences in these two societies. As Taiwan and the mainland China (and other similar <b>geopolitical</b> <b>situations</b> around the globe) continue to negotiate their political future, we use this historical case-study to propose a cross-disciplined, contextual journalism education which includes popular culture, in this case film, as a tool for media pedagogy...|$|R

Gadahn provides Western viewers with an expository look at the group's ideals, philosophy and goals as well as a retrospective look at their perspective on the <b>geopolitical</b> <b>situations</b> which led to their decision to execute the attack. The film culminates with Gadahn's description of the events' aftermath, pre-attack martyrdom videos filmed by the hijackers, and finally a montage of videos portraying the attacks themselves. The high production-value film, completely captioned for both English and Arabic-speaking audiences, is widely regarded as a tool intended to motivate and attract other Western-born Muslims.|$|R
25|$|When Boris I {{assumed the}} throne of Bulgaria in 852, the country was still pagan, with the ruling Bulgar elite being Tengriists while the Slavic {{population}} practised its own religion. Christianity was already widespread in Bulgaria as the country was established on former territories of the Byzantine Empire, and {{seems to have been}} influential. Even one of the sons of Khan Omurtag (r. 814–831), Enravota, converted to Christianity. The Bulgarian nobility was strongly opposed to any form of Byzantine influence in the country and was therefore hostile to Christianity as it was directly associated with the Byzantine Empire. Boris I, however, had many reasons to consider conversion— Bulgaria was situated between two powerful Christian empires, Byzantium and East Francia; Christian doctrine particularly favoured the position of the monarch as God's representative on Earth; and finally, Boris also saw Christianity as a way to overcome the differences between Bulgars and Slavs. The <b>geopolitical</b> <b>situation</b> in the mid 9th century was also favourable because of the increasing friction and rivalry between the Papacy in Rome and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople for influence in Central Europe. That struggle between the two churches would give the Bulgarian ruler the opportunity to manoeuvre and negotiate with both, thus extracting favourable concessions while keeping the country out of direct foreign influence. When the Byzantines invaded Bulgaria in the autumn of 863 and demanded conversion to Christianity from Constantinople as the single condition to retreat, Boris I readily accepted and was baptised in the beginning of 864, assuming the Christian name Michael after his spiritual godfather, the Byzantine Emperor Michael III. That step was very unpopular among the nobility, but when they rebelled Boris I dealt decisively with them and executed 52 magnates along with their whole families. When in the following year the Byzantines sturdily demonstrated their determination not to allow the existence of an autocephalous Bulgarian Church, Boris I decided to turn to the Papacy.|$|E

To manage these crises, the Jordanian government aims to diversify Jordan’s energy sources and to promote local energy production. It has begun a gradual reduction in subsidies for fossil fuels and it has prepared legal and financial forecasts based on the strong potentials of solar and wind power.

500|$|The {{effect of}} the {{security}} forces' decisive counter-campaign was undone by two drastic changes to the <b>geopolitical</b> <b>situation</b> in 1974 and 1975, each relating {{to one of the}} Rhodesian government's two main backers, Portugal and South Africa. In Lisbon, a military coup on 25 April 1974 replaced the right-wing Estado Novo administration with a leftist government opposed to the unpopular Colonial War in Angola, Mozambique and Portugal's other African territories. Following this coup, which became known as the Carnation Revolution, Portuguese leadership was hurriedly withdrawn from Lisbon's overseas territories, each of which was earmarked for an immediate handover to communist guerrillas. Brief, frenzied negotiations with FRELIMO in Mozambique preceded the country's independence on 25 June 1975; FRELIMO took power without contesting an election, while Samora Machel assumed the presidency. Now that Mozambique was under a friendly government, ZANLA could freely base themselves there with the full support of Machel and FRELIMO, with whom an alliance had already existed since the late 1960s. The Rhodesian Security Forces, on the other hand, now had a further [...] of border to defend and had to rely on South Africa alone for imports.|$|E

While previous studies of the negotiations followed mainly the approach of traditional historical research, the present study offers a new perspective of the ‘neglected’ participants – the interpreters {{who worked for the}} series of negotiations. An analysis of “post-hoc accounts” of interpreters, using a micro-historical approach, demonstrates complexity of interpreting for wartime negotiations and reveals various conflicts in the interpreting of armistice negotiations as perceived by the interpreters. Intense conflicts were found in the interpreting activity, including: conflicts between the interpreters {{on both sides of the}} negotiations, hidden conflicts between the interpreters and their principals, conflicts between different interpreter roles, conflicts over language use between the two sides of the negotiations, and conflicts arising from misconceptions of the interpreting activity. It was also discovered that the interpreters in the armistice negotiations were generally loyal as the army soldiers instead of maintaining a neutral stance, such as is expected from professional interpreters nowadays. The micro-historical study of the interpreters’ accounts of the major historical events can be useful in exploring and explaining what is hidden behind the complexity of conflicts, thus offering a new approach to interpreting studies as well as to historical studies...|$|R

Wellington was waiting to be debriefed on his Indian operations, and Nelson on his chase and future plans.

500|$|The <b>geopolitical</b> <b>situation</b> tilted further against Smith in December 1974 {{when the}} South African Prime Minister BJ Vorster {{pressured}} him into accepting a détente initiative involving the Frontline States of Zambia, Tanzania and Botswana (Mozambique and Angola {{would join the}} following year). Vorster had concluded that Rhodesia's position was untenable and that South African interests {{would be better served}} by collaborating with black African governments over a Rhodesian settlement; he hoped that success in this might win South Africa some international legitimacy and allow it to retain apartheid. Détente forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup, and required the Rhodesians to release the ZANU and ZAPU leaders so they could attend a conference in Rhodesia, united under the UANC banner and led by Muzorewa. When Rhodesia stopped releasing black nationalist prisoners on the grounds that ZANLA and ZIPRA were not observing the ceasefire, Vorster harried Smith further by withdrawing the South African Police, which had been helping the Rhodesians patrol the countryside. Smith remained stubborn, saying {{in the run-up to the}} conference that [...] "We have no policy in Rhodesia to hand over to a black majority government" [...] and that his government instead favoured [...] "a qualified franchise for all Rhodesians... ensure that government will be retained in responsible hands for all times".|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes contemporary global {{fiction in}} English (and, in one chapter, new media literatures such as videogame-based narratives) {{to examine how}} individuals, communities, and globalized networks manage differences among historical interpretations, ideologies, lived experiences, and cultural and national traditions making competing demands. Cultural and media theorists like John Tomlinson, Anthony Giddens, Arjun Appadurai, Lev Manovich, and Ian Bogost have demonstrated the overwhelming complexity of life {{in an age of}} accelerating globalization. Building on their work and the narrative theory of Maggie Dunn and Ann Morris, I explore how literary narratives employ newly prominent composite narrative structures to represent and enact key methods of managing overwhelming globalized connectivity in our lives and narratives. Narrative compositing is exemplified in recent global fiction structured around multiple focal points dispersed across times, locations, ideologies, identities, <b>geopolitical</b> <b>situations,</b> and technological networks. These composite narrative forms complicate postmodern narrative and require that we rethink the postmodern condition in terms of the diverse influences and experiences of globalization. Early chapters analyze novels centrally concerned with globalization as well as others presenting globalization as an unobtrusive but significant structuring device. Later chapters examine technological as well as thematic and narrative compositing in a new media narrative and how compositing can help explain the posthumanist dynamics of globalization and technology and the interactions of globalization and postmemory, followed by a brief conclusion on classroom pedagogy...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of smartphones {{equipped with a}} front camera and constantly connected to social networks has encouraged the spread of usergenerated content of multimedia nature. This {{led to the emergence}} of new social phenomena that have a strong impact on society, like the selfie, a modern evolution of the selfportrait usually taken with a digital camera or a camera phone. In the last three years, especially on Instagram, the selfie trend got popularity. Defined in 2013 as "a photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and shared via social media", by the Oxford Dictionary, which added selfie to its lexicon and then named it name of the year. This work analyzes the phenomenon inside Instagram, a mobile socialbased network created specifically for image sharing. Given the strong social implications, we tried to understand the origin of this practice, the psychological and sociological reasons that gave birth to the trend. Then, through the webbased platform ALOS (A Lot Of Selfies) we collected information from instagram, performed face recognition and calculated statistics about the trend. As a case study, over 2 million selfies shared on Instagram in January February 2015 were analyzed. This highlighted how the selfie phenomenon is perceived differently in various cultures and societies. In particular, the results show that factors such religion, sex, customs and <b>geopolitical</b> <b>situations</b> affect the spacetime distribution of selfies around the world...|$|R
30|$|The drastic {{fluctuation}} {{of international}} oil price {{will have a}} significant impact on China, the second largest oil consumer and the third oil-importing country in the world. Supported by the favorable economic situation, substantial growth in petrochemical production and strong demand for car ownership, it is expected that China’s oil demand will increase by 1.8 million barrels per day in 2016 – 2022, with an average annual growth rate of about 2.4 %. In addition, the pattern of international crude oil trade will also change. China, India and Southeast Asia will jointly push the international crude oil flow from the west to the east. In the next 5 years, China’s net daily imports of crude oil will reach 9.5 million barrels, which is next only to the United States’ record of 10 million barrels per day in the beginning of this century. Firstly, in the process of strengthening international cooperation, China should make effective use of foreign resources to ensure energy security. Secondly, the trend of the international crude oil price is needed for our country’s refined oil price adjustment. At present, China’s dependence on foreign crude oil and gas is more than 65 % and 30 %. The import price of crude oil in China is greatly affected by the price of international commodity futures market. With this background, China should continue to increase investment, accelerate the national strategic crude oil reserve facilities, increase enterprise reserves infrastructure, enhance the commercial crude oil storage capacity and reduce the impact of the international energy market volatility on China’s economy. Thirdly, China will strengthen cooperation with the “One Belt and One Road” initiative along the country’s energy field, which can enrich China’s imports of energy sources to deal with future complicated <b>geopolitical</b> <b>situations.</b>|$|R
