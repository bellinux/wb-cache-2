40|$|With the {{anticipation}} of increasing system demands, the need to integrate multiple functions (e. g. digital, analog, high voltage, etc.) on a single chip has become apparent. PICs (power integrated circuits), which combine high-voltage, high-current output devices with low-voltage logic and control elements, have provided better performance and reliability, and reduced cost and system size compared to the discrete approach. A major issue {{for the design of}} this kind of circuits is the substrate cross-talk between adjacent power and CMOS devices, which prevents normal operation of the circuits. The issue becomes more severe in automotive applications, in which a high temperature environment is usually involved. The commonly used isolation techniques in PICs are the traditional p-n junction isolation (JI) and the <b>dielectric</b> <b>isolation</b> (DI). But JI still requires large silicon area, and the electrical isolation is rather poor. Although the superiority of DI offered by SOI (silicon-on-insulator) technology results in a much smaller chip area and minimum leakage current, the higher wafer cost and lower heat dissipation capability limit it only to niche applications. In this paper, a novel bulk silicon isolation structure with wafer-thick, front-back trench is proposed for automotive (42 V) power integrated circuit (PIC) applications. This technique provides the advantages of complete isolation with lower wafer cost and higher thermal dissipation capability compared with the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology. Experimental results show that the novel isolation structure can provide complete electrical isolation and a 13 % reduction in the thermal resistance compared to the SOI technology. In addition, this novel <b>isolation</b> <b>technology</b> offers a potential cost reduction of 5 X to 10 X compared to the SOI technology...|$|R

40|$|Mobile device antenna {{design and}} <b>isolation</b> <b>technologies</b> are {{thoroughly}} investigated in this thesis. The antenna design parameters for mobile devices are quantified using practical restraints by analyzing almost 60 mobile handsets {{and the effect}} of materials, human tissue, manufacturing, and antenna type/placement on antenna design and then mapped into Wheeler-space that correlates the spherical wave modes with the antenna performance. The <b>isolation</b> <b>technologies</b> with mutual coupling anti-resonances are unified by a single performance parameter to distinguish them from the more traditional <b>isolation</b> <b>technologies.</b> This unifying performance parameter is the group delay between two antennas where high group delay indicates the presence of a bandstop filter in the form of either a PCB or an antenna modification. This thesis analyzes both PCB and antenna modifications with high group-delay and demonstrates these types of antennas can be placed in close proximity without affecting other performance parameters. It is also shown that both the PCB and antenna modifications contain two isolation methods where each isolation method is a mirror complement of the other method. Some antenna geometries can also increase the mutual coupling in order to improve the antenna performance using a phenomena called over-coupling. These over-coupled antenna systems can result in lower SAR for the cellular antennas and decreased array sizes for NFC/RFID/wireless-power antennas, resulting in better performance of antennas inside mobile devices. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
