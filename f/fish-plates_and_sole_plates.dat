50|$|In {{addition}} to speed, fitness, artistic, or skating for fun, some skaters prefer to skate aggressively. Aggressive skating {{is referred to}} by participants as rollerblading, blading, skating or rolling and refers to not only the variety of maneuvers that include a variety of grinds, airs, cess slides, toe/heel rolls and other advanced skating stunts but also the equipment used. Aggressive skates are rollerblades that include aspects of the skate that facilitates grinds, this includes a plastic frame with a space in the middle for grinding, <b>and,</b> <b>sole</b> <b>plates</b> that allow the practitioner to grind {{on the side of}} the boot. Types of aggressive skating include Park and Street. The range of wheel size for aggressive inline skates range from 40mm to 72mm, the median ranging in the general vicinity of 53mm - 58mm.|$|R
50|$|Other {{conventional}} features {{included a}} split trail <b>and</b> turntable <b>sole</b> <b>plate.</b> Initially, it had assisted loading, but became an early user of flick-ramming. In accordance with long-standing UK practice, it used one-man laying. All {{this meant that}} the gun could be operated by a minimum detachment of only 4 men (commander, layer and 2 loaders). The burst fire rate was 3 rounds in 15 seconds. It was also fitted with a direct fire telescope.|$|R
40|$|About {{three years}} after the Goldstone Deep Space Station antenna was dedicated, grout under the {{hydrostatic}} bearing runner was found to be interacting with the runner, causing rust to form between the runner <b>and</b> the <b>sole</b> <b>plates</b> upon which it rests. The rust formed unevenly and the runner could not be kept flat so in 1969 the grout was removed and replaced with a Portland cement and sand dry pack grout that was less likely to produce rust. In the years that followed, oil leaking from the runner assembly caused progressive deterioration of the drypack grout. In 1982 over one thousand hours of spacecraft tracking time were lost due to this deterioration. A plan was developed to rehabilitate the bearing. The plan called for raising the rotating structure free from the concrete pedestal and placing it on three pairs of external support columns. With the weight of the structure transferred to the columns, the pads and runner could be removed and the repair started. The very successful repair included the replacement of {{a significant portion of the}} antenna pedestal...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> area of motor end plates of the frog is ultrastructurally examined with different postfixation methods. We concentrated in this case on the proof of the smooth and rough sarcoplasmic reticulum of the <b>sole</b> <b>plate.</b> The relations of the smooth and rough sarcoplasmic reticulum to subsynaptic folds and the local T-system and its connections to diads and triads in the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> area are represented. The morphological differences between mammal and frog are pointed out. The possible functions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the myofibril-free sarcoplasm are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper analyse {{the force}} of the column base plate which {{suffering}} the axial pressure. First, the comparative analysis between the traditional model and interaction model is made. Second, for the steel frame, <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> concreat base as a entirety, analyse the factor which affect the stress distribution of <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> base top at the different working condition. Result shows that, there is a big gap on the result between the traditional model and interaction model, difference of length-wide ratio of box column section have a small affect on the stress of base top. The change of concreat strength have a big affect on the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> concreat stress distribution...|$|R

50|$|Control is {{an issue}} with jigsaws. The blades are small, weak and entirely {{unsupported}} at the lower end. Good cut control requires the presence of blade rollers, which keep the blade aligned just above the <b>sole</b> <b>plate.</b> Heavy cast <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> saws are somewhat better than pressed steel for sawing line control too. To guide a jigsaw on curved cut, it must be steered (turned) and not forced to move sideways. The usage of sharp blades is important as well to get high quality cuts.|$|R
50|$|A jigsaw with a bevel {{function}} on the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> allows cutting {{angles of}} typically up to 45 degrees {{relative to the}} normal vertical stroke for cutting miter joints.|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} thin (≤ 150 nm) and thick (> 150 nm) sections, {{the shape and}} {{position}} of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and of the Golgi apparatus in the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> in the remaining subsarcolemmal sarcoplasmic region were investigated. For this purpose the membranes were stained by means of imidazole-osmium postfixation and unstained sections analyzed under the electron microscope. Both in the sarcoplasma of the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> around the muscle fiber nuclei, a network of tubules is visible after imidazole-osmium staining which can be identified as the sarcoplasmic reticulum {{solely on the basis}} of its contacts with the perinuclear cistern and the cisterns of the triads. Findings in literature on the position of the Golgi apparatus are confirmed and similar spatial relationships and vesiculations between the perinuclear cisterns and the Golgi apparatus of the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> nuclei <b>and</b> the other subsarcolemmal fiber nuclei are also demonstrated using this new staining method...|$|R
50|$|The iron is {{the small}} {{appliance}} used to remove wrinkles from fabric. It {{is also known as}} a clothes iron, flat iron, or smoothing iron. The piece at the bottom is called a <b>sole</b> <b>plate.</b> Ironing uses heat energy, chemical energy, electrical energy, and mechanical energy.|$|R
50|$|These boots {{have also}} been {{released}} in the Miracle, Glide, and Victory versions, all version III (three). Although it appears that {{all three of the}} lower versions have at least a little bit of fiberglass on their <b>sole</b> <b>plate,</b> except for the Victory versions, it is actually just a sticker to improve marketing ability. The sticker on Miracle version has a zig-zag design on the fiberglass, the Glide versions have a sticker {{down the middle of the}} <b>sole</b> <b>plate,</b> but with no design in it, and as mentioned before, the Victory version has no sticker on its soleplate. The Vapor VIII is worn by Juan Mata, Didier Drogba, Eden Hazard, Neymar, Paul Aguilar, Andrey Arshavin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Alexandre Pato, Mesut Özil, Christian Eriksen and Theo Walcott, among others.|$|R
5000|$|A steel-toe boot (also {{known as}} a safety boot, steel-capped boot or safety shoe) is a durable boot or shoe that has a {{protective}} reinforcement in the toe which protects the foot from falling objects or compression, usually combined with a mid <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> to protect against punctures from below.|$|R
25|$|A tie <b>plate,</b> {{baseplate}} or <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> is a {{steel plate}} used on rail tracks between flanged T rail and the crossties. The tie plate increases bearing area {{and holds the}} rail to correct gauge. They are fastened to wooden ties by means of spikes or bolts through holes in the plate.|$|R
50|$|A ski binding has {{to provide}} {{two types of}} support. One is a locking {{function}} that keeps the ski under the boot, but releases when too much strain {{is placed on the}} binding (as {{in the case of a}} fall). In the Nava System, this was provided by the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> the ski bindings, in the same general way as any modern binding.|$|R
50|$|The boot is {{available}} in either Soft Ground (SG) (now Soft Ground Pro; SG-Pro), Firm Ground (FG) or Artificial Ground (AG) versions. The SG version's <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> is fitted with six NikeSnap removable studs (now with molded plastic studs), which can be purchased in different lengths, {{for the first and}} second models, and traditional screw-in aluminium studs for versions 3 to 8; the FG version has seven moulded blades.|$|R
50|$|The terms <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> or {{sill plate}} {{are used for}} the members {{at the bottom of}} a wall at the {{foundation}} but are most often just called a sole or sill without the word plate. Other load bearing timbers use the term plate but are not in the wall such as crown plate, a purlin-like beam carried by crown posts in roof framing, and a purlin plate which supports common rafters.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls and}} floors rest on {{foundations}} consisting of 4 × 4 inch (10 × 10 cm) stumps with 15 × 9 inch (38 × 23 cm) <b>sole</b> <b>plates.</b> On these are 4 × 3 inch (10 × 8 cm) bearers and 4 × 2 inch (10 × 5 cm) joists at 2 feet 10 inch (86 cm) centres. The floor {{is made from}} tongue and groove floorboards.|$|R
2500|$|There are two {{standard}} {{types of}} router—plunge and fixed. When using a plunge-base router, {{the sole of}} the base {{is placed on the}} face of the work with the cutting bit raised above the work, then the motor is turned on and the cutter is lowered into the work. [...] With a fixed-base router, the cut depth is set before the tool is turned on. [...] The <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> is then either rested flat on the workpiece overhanging the edge so that the cutting bit is not contacting the work (and then entering the work from the side once the motor is turned on), or the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> is placed at an angle with the bit above the work and the bit is [...] "rocked" [...] over into the work once the motor is turned on. [...] In each case, the bit cuts its way in, but the plunge router does it in a more refined way, although the bit used must be shaped so it bores into the wood when lowered.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to define and to {{summarize}} the manner, the context {{and the meaning of}} depictions of marine fauna in the Ancient Art from 8 th century BC to 5 th century AD in the Mediterranean region. Based on remarks of ancient authors and on current secondary literature it compiles and comments on some pieces of Acient Art. Artistic motives with marine fauna were very popular in the ancient times and they can join a wide range of situations and contexts: from attributes of divinities and symbols of marine location to filling ornaments. Their significance was economic, social, as well as mythological and symbolical. The peak of their popularity is represented by black-figure vases, south Italian <b>fish-plates</b> <b>and</b> Hellenistic mosaics. Realistic and ornamental tendencies of style coexisted. While drawing and painting suited better to fish and cephalopods, sculpture flattered dolphins...|$|R
2500|$|The tool usually {{consists}} of a base housing a vertically mounted universal electric motor with a collet {{on the end of}} its shaft. The bit is height-adjustable to allow protrusion through an opening in a flat <b>sole</b> <b>plate,</b> usually via adjusting the motor-mounting height (the mechanism of adjustment is widely varied among manufacturers). [...] Control of the router is derived from a handle or knob {{on each side of the}} device, or by the more recently developed [...] "D-handle".|$|R
25|$|The spindle router is {{positioned}} at the finer {{end of the}} scale of work done by a moulding spindle. That is to say it is able to cut grooves, edge moulding, and chamfer or radius the edge of a piece of wood. It is also possible to use it for cutting some joints. The shape of cut that is created is determined by {{the size and shape of}} the bit (cutter) held in the collet and the depth by the depth adjustment of the <b>sole</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
50|$|The North 26 is a boat {{designed}} by Julian D Everitt in 1982, Cowes UK, {{designer of the}} very successful E boat. Big brother to the E-boat, intended for Yacht racing Inshore and in Junior Offshore Group races to rate under Channel now IRC measurement rule. Examples race the English Channel and have a wide flat <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> {{that enables them to}} sit the mud in English ports with the keel retracted. This feature also enables safe beach sitting whilst cruising and use as a Trailer yacht.|$|R

50|$|The Nava System was a ski binding {{and custom}} ski boot {{offered for sale}} in the 1980s. The system used a {{combination}} of flexible <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> to keep the boot centered, and a spring-loaded plastic arm on the rear binding that was used to transmit sideways motions of the leg to the ski. This eliminated the need for a hard shell on the boot; the Nava boot was soft and resembled a knee-high winter boot. In spite of numerous endorsements by racing stars, the system never caught on and sales ended by the late 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|A sill <b>plate</b> or <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> in {{construction}} <b>and</b> architecture {{is the bottom}} horizontal member of a wall or building to which vertical members are attached. The word plate is typically omitted in America and carpenters speak simply of the [...] "sill". Other names are ground plate, ground sill, groundsel, and midnight sill. Sill plates are usually composed of lumber but can be any material. The timber {{at the top of}} a wall is often called a top plate, pole plate, wall plate or simply [...] "the plate".|$|R
5000|$|The work of SEPP has {{demonstrated}} that the medieval bishop’s palace was largely surrounded by a moat. [...] In all probability the earliest palace was constructed from timber on the platform enclosed by the moat, from which the water flowed through a ditch leading to the Marshes Burn. The 2006 excavation uncovered evidence for an oak palisade {{on the inside of}} the moat, surrounding the buildings of the palace. [...] The entrance to the palace from the southeast would have been over a timber trestle bridge, the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> of which was excavated in 2009.|$|R
6000|$|... "In the {{meantime}} {{you will be}} interested to know what my movements were. Everything had been prepared for days before, and only the finishing touches were needed. The side line which we had chosen had once joined the main line, {{but it had been}} disconnected. We had only to replace a few rails to connect it once more. These rails had been laid down as far as could be done without danger of attracting attention, and now it was merely a case of completing a juncture with the line, and arranging the points as they had been before. The sleepers had never been removed, <b>and</b> the rails, <b>fish-plates</b> <b>and</b> rivets were all ready, for we had taken them from a siding on the abandoned portion of the line. With my small but competent band of workers, we had everything ready long before the special arrived. When it did arrive, it ran off upon the small side line so easily that the jolting of the points appears to have been entirely unnoticed by the two travellers.|$|R
50|$|Many {{railways}} {{preferred a}} {{flat bottom rail}} section, where the rails could be laid directly on the sleepers, representing a marked cost saving. Indenting of the sleeper was the problem; where the traffic was heavy, it became necessary to provide a <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> under the rails to spread the load on the tie, partly vitiating the cost saving. However, in main line situations, this form found almost universal adoption in North America and Australia, and in much of continental Europe. The United Kingdom persisted with bullhead rail in main line use, with widespread introduction of flat-bottom rail only starting in about 1947.|$|R

50|$|The {{width of}} the line at {{formation}} level is 11 feet on the embankments and 12 feet in cuttings. The gauges were 4 feet 8½ inches. The permanent way consists of flat-bottomed or Vignoles patterned rail stated to weigh 40 lbs per lineal yard in lengths of 15 feet, 17 feet 6 inches, and 21 feet, laid on transverse sleepers of half-round Baltic timber creosoted (4½ in.), and 9 feet long placed at an average distance of three feet apart, centre to centre, except that {{on some of the}} sharpest curves an extra sleeper has been inserted under every 21 feet length of rail. No chairs are made use of, but the rail is fastened to the transverse sleepers by a fang-bolt with a clip under the head, overlapping the flange of the rail on one side, and by a wrought iron spike on the other side. On the sharpest curves a wrought iron plate is laid between the rail and the sleeper, with holes punched in it, through which the fang-bolt and spike are driven; the joints of the rails are fastened with wrought iron <b>fish-plates</b> <b>and</b> bolts, and secured to the sleepers with a fang-bolt and clip {{on each side of the}} rail. The ballast is of gravel, a small proportion of sand; it was required according to the contract, to be eight inches deep under the sleepers, but is stated to average about one foot. No engine turn table has been provided. The line has a very large number of sharp curves having radii of 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 chains. The steepest incline is 1 in 66.|$|R
25|$|The {{baseplate}} (<b>sole</b> <b>plate)</b> {{is generally}} circular (though this, too, varies by individual models) {{and may be}} used in conjunction with a fence attached to the base, which then braces the router against the edge of the work, or via a straight-edge clamped across the work to obtain a straight cut. Other means of guiding the machine include the template guide bushing secured in the base around the router cutter, or router cutters with built-in guide bearings. Both of these run against a straight edge or shaped template. Without this, the varying reaction of the wood against the torque of the tool makes it impossible to control with the precision normally required.|$|R
50|$|Hull material, {{design for}} Ply, Aluminium or Fibreglass. Multichine {{for ease of}} amateur construction.
