5|$|Because Virginia Tech <b>had</b> <b>{{received}}</b> <b>the</b> opening kickoff, Georgia {{received the}} ball to open the second half.

Pinned at their ten-yard line by the Georgia punt, Virginia Tech went three-and-out and was itself forced to punt.|$|E

These messages were, contrary to earlier historical accounts, also received by Nagumo before the battle began. For reasons which remain unclear, Nagumo did not alter his plans or take additional precautions.|$|E

5|$|Because Florida State <b>had</b> <b>{{received}}</b> <b>the</b> game's opening kickoff, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. As in the first half, however, the Virginia Tech offense failed to advance the ball in any meaningful fashion. Marcus Vick threw two incompletions and running back Cedric Humes managed a short three-yard dash. Forced to punt the ball away yet again, Virginia Tech set up the game's critical play. From his 34-yard line, punter Nic Schmitt kicked the ball 49yards to the Seminoles' Willie Reid, who broke through the Virginia Tech special teams punt coverage for an 89-yard punt-return touchdown.
