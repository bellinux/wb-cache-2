5|$|Legend has it {{that the}} Cailleach was tired from a long day herding deer. Atop Ben Cruachan she <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> her watch and a well she was tending overflowed, running down from the {{highlands}} and flooding the valleys below, forming first a river and then the loch. The overflowing well is a common motif in local Gaelic creation tales - as seen in the goddess Boann's similar creation of the River Boyne in Ireland. Other connections to the region include her above-mentioned strong ties with the fierce whirlpool in the Gulf of Corryvreckan.|$|E
25|$|In a {{much later}} {{interpolated}} detail, Ares put the young soldier Alectryon by his door to warn them of Helios's arrival as Helios would tell Hephaestus of Aphrodite's infidelity {{if the two}} were discovered, but Alectryon <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> guard duty. Helios discovered the two and alerted Hephaestus. The furious Ares turned the sleepy Alectryon into a rooster which now always announces {{the arrival of the}} sun in the morning.|$|E
25|$|A State {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by a}} chain of mistakes owing to the negligence of air traffic controllers, as well as disobedience of basic airport maintenance and safety regulations. The ground controller was found directly responsible, as he <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> the job and thus did not respond to emergency queries; he also allowed the service trucks to move onto the runway and did not mark the runway as occupied. At a hearing, he could not recollect his actions during the time in question, but did not deny the charges. He was sentenced to 15 years and committed suicide in prison. In addition, the flight operations manager was sentenced to 15 years in prison, the approach controller to 13 years, and the head of airport maintenance to 12 years. All three appealed their sentences, to no avail. Future inspections at numerous other Soviet airports also found similar types and numbers of violations of safety regulations, resulting in the firing of several high-level officials thereafter.|$|E

5000|$|On September 10, 2012, Francesa famously <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> live <b>on</b> air {{during a}} segment with Yankees beat {{reporter}} Sweeny Murti. He would later deny {{he had fallen}} asleep after national ridicule and mockery including fans calling into the show.|$|R
60|$|Having {{finished}} the meal, Lesher and Baxter {{sat down in}} the living room to smoke and to talk over the situation. The mate continued to drink, and half an hour later he <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> sitting <b>on</b> the bench, and with his head on the table.|$|R
500|$|For the defence, Robin Grey QC, {{explained}} to the jury that such was the extent of Hodgson's compulsive lying that he had confessed to 200 different crimes, including murders that had not happened. The Crown's case against Hodgson was that he [...] "under the influence of drink, broke into the deceased's car, intending to steal it, but then <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> the back seat. When the deceased returned to her car she put her handbag onto {{the back seat and}} brushed against [...] He seized her by the back of her jumper, twisted it and strangled her, and when she was dead or dying he raped her, removing her underwear and tights with such force that one leg of the tights was torn from the other. Thereafter he made away from the scene after taking various items from the deceased." [...] Hodgson's confessions were {{a significant part of the}} case against him. The jury retired to consider their verdict at 11:00a.m. on 5February 1982, and their unanimous guilty verdict was returned at 14:15 (2:15p.m.) the same day.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr later {{supplied}} Sutcliffe and {{the other}} Beatles with Preludin, which, when taken with beer, made them feel euphoric and helped to keep them awake until {{the early hours of}} the morning. The Beatles had taken Preludin before, but it was possible at that time to get Preludin only with a doctor's prescription note, so Kirchherr's mother got them from a local chemist, who supplied them without asking questions. After meeting Kirchherr, Lennon filled his letters to Cynthia Powell (his girlfriend at the time) with [...] "Astrid said this, Astrid did that", which made Powell jealous, until she read that Sutcliffe was in a relationship with Kirchherr. When Powell visited Hamburg with Dot Rhone (McCartney's girlfriend at the time) in April 1961, they stayed at Kirchherr's house. In August 1963, Kirchherr met Lennon and Cynthia in Paris while they were both there for a belated honeymoon, as Kirchherr was there with a girlfriend for a few days' holiday. The four of them went from wine bar to wine bar and finally ended up back at Kirchherr's lodgings, where all four <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> Kirchherr's single bed.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the book}} Bohanjip (보한집; 補閑集) written by a Goryeo-era writer Choi Ja (최자; 崔滋) in 1230, a man named Kim Kae In (김개인; 金蓋仁) {{residing}} in Kyeorung-Hyun (거령현) (modern day Imsi-Gun (임실군), [...] Osu-Myun (오수면), Jeolla province) of Korea had a very loyal dog. One day, Kim went to a party at a nearby town with his dog, got very drunk, and <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> a nearby grassland on his way home. At that time, a forest fire started near the place where Kim was sleeping.|$|E

50|$|It {{is related}} {{that the future}} Byzantine Emperor Marcian, when still a simple soldier, <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> while resting <b>on</b> a hunt near Sidyma, and {{was found to be}} {{sheltered}} by a large eagle, a presage of his future elevation.|$|R

2500|$|Although Orange Man was {{produced}} in 1991, it is not believed to have aired on British television until 1992 on television channels such as ITV and Channel 4, where it became the first advertisement in the [...] "You Know When You've Been Tango'd" [...] campaign, which would continue until 1996 before being revived from 2002–2005. Orange Man was an instant success; Robinson recalled in 2015 that [...] "I first knew the ad was huge when I <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> the London Underground one evening. I woke up to hear {{a group of kids}} talking about and mimicking it. I wanted to go up and say: 'I did that!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1986, Faith No More {{was signed}} to Los Angeles label Slash Records by Anna Statman. The label had {{recently}} been sold to the Warner Music Group subsidiary London Records, ensuring a widespread release for the band's following albums. Introduce Yourself was released in 1987, and a revamped version of their debut album's title track [...] "We Care a Lot" [...] saw minor success on MTV. Mosley's behaviour had started to become increasingly erratic, particularly during a troubled tour of Europe in 1988. Incidents include him allegedly punching Billy Gould on stage, the release party for the album Introduce Yourself — during which he <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> stage — and one of Mosley's roadies getting into a fist fight with guitarist Jim Martin during the European tour. Mosley was eventually fired after the band returned home from Europe. Billy Gould reflected [...] "There was a certain point when I went to rehearsal, and Chuck wanted to do all acoustic guitar songs. It was just so far off the mark. The upshot was that I got up, walked out and quit the band. I Just said: ‘I’m done – I can’t take this any longer. It’s just so ridiculous’. The same day, I talked to Bordin, and he said: ‘Well, I still {{want to play with}} you’. Bottum did the same thing. It was another one of these ‘firing somebody without firing them’ scenarios." ...|$|E

60|$|He <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> fancying himself <b>on</b> {{the way up}} {{the trail}} to the mine, and when he woke to find the good, {{rectifying}} rays of the morning sun filling his room the theories of the night were absurd. He desired to see the girl again, not to warn her of her peril, but because she was piquant and lovely, as befitted her romantic surroundings.|$|R

50|$|Bookstores became {{interested}} in carrying Ewing's novel, which allegedly had been banned in Boston. When publisher Ian Ballantine, novelist Theodore Sturgeon, and Shepherd met for lunch, Ballantine hired Sturgeon {{to write a novel}} based on Shepherd's outline. Betty Ballantine completed the final chapter after Sturgeon <b>fell</b> exhausted <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> the Ballantines' couch, having tried to meet the deadline in one marathon typing session. On September 13, 1956, Ballantine Books published I, Libertine simultaneously in hardcover and paperback editions with Shepherd seen looking as dissolute as possible, as Ewing, in the back cover author's photograph. The proceeds were donated to charity.|$|R

60|$|It was impossible, till morning dawned, {{either to}} get matters into any order, or to {{overhaul}} the prize they had taken; {{and many of the}} men were so much exhausted that they <b>fell</b> fast <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> the deck ere the surgeon had time to dress their wounds. However, Amyas contrived, when once the ship was leaping merrily, close-hauled against a fresh land-breeze, to count his little flock, and found out of the forty-four but six seriously wounded, and none killed. However, their working numbers were now reduced to thirty-eight, beside the four negroes, a scanty crew enough to take home such a ship to England.|$|R

50|$|Substitute protégé Henry Methvin's ambush-earned Texas pardon didn't {{help him}} in Oklahoma, where {{he was convicted of}} the 1934 murder of Constable Campbell at Commerce. He was paroled in 1942 and killed by a train in 1948; it was said that he <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> drunk, <b>on</b> the tracks, but there were rumors that he had been pushed by parties seeking revenge for his {{betrayal}} of Clyde Barrow. His father Ivy had been killed in 1946 by a hit-and-run driver, and there was talk of foul play in this instance also. Bonnie Parker's husband Roy Thornton was sentenced {{to five years in prison}} for burglary in March 1933. He was killed by guards on October 3, 1937, during an escape attempt from Eastham Farm prison.|$|R
5000|$|Then {{he became}} a drummer for the English band Iron Maiden in 1977-1978, long time before he would create his masked persona. A lot of fantastic stories about the {{behaviour}} of Purkis during his tenure in Iron Maiden exist, {{one of which was}} that during a gig he <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> whilst <b>on</b> stage. During his early Samson tenure, Purkis was also asked to rejoin Iron Maiden in 1980 after the band had been touring with Samson but declined in favour of staying with Samson. This was mainly because his bizarre theatrical image had gained recognition, and he was then seen to be [...] "the face of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal". His Samson predecessor Clive Burr eventually took the Maiden position.|$|R

Following his steadiness on parade on Airborne Forces Day in 1980 and participation in the parade of the Royal Wedding, he was promoted in July 1981 to Lance Corporal. This was followed by promotions to Corporal in March 1983 and Sergeant in January 1990. Not all public duties went according to plan. During an appearance in 1991 at the Savoy Hotel, he <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> while <b>on</b> public duty.
