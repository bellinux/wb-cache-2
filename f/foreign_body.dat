The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the pattern of otorhinolaryngeal <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies</b> in a Tertiary Health Institution in Sokoto, North-Western Nigeria. Materials and Methods: This is a 2 year retrospective study using the records of all cases of ENT <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies</b> at Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto, from January 2009 to December 2010. Data analysis was carried out using the SPSS for windows version 13. 0. Results: A total of 90 cases were analysed. Ear <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies</b> 48 (53. 3 %) were commonest, followed by nasal <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies</b> 16 (17. 8 %), bronchial <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies</b> 15 (16. 7 %), and esophageal <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies</b> 11 (12. 2 %).

5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E

Aim: To know the commonest symptoms and signs of presentation, average duration of time lapse between inhalation and seeking ofmedical helpand the common difficulties encountered during the endoscopic removal of <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies</b> in the tracheobronchial tree. Method: This study comprises 52 cases of tracheobronchial <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies.</b> This was a descriptive time bound study conducted at department of ENT, KIMS, Hubli, Karnataka, India. All cases of clinically suspected <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies</b> of tracheobronchial tree were included in the study. Results: The age group of 1 - 2 years had the highest incidence of airway <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies</b> (46. 15 %). Sex ratio was 1. 6 : 1 showing male preponderance. 50 % of the airway <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies</b> presented within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. Cough (84. 61 %), respiratory distress (61. 53 %) were the predominant symptoms and decreased air entry (84. 61 %) followed by rhonchi (69. 23 %) were the main signs of airway <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies.</b> Ground nut and tamarind seeds were the most common <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies</b> inhaled.
