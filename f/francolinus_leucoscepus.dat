25|$|Four {{papillomavirus}}es {{are known}} to infect birds: Fringilla coelebs papillomavirus 1, <b>Francolinus</b> <b>leucoscepus</b> papillomavirus 1, Psittacus erithacus papillomavirus 1 and Pygoscelis adeliae papillomavirus 1. All these species have a gene (E9) of unknown function suggesting a common origin.|$|E
40|$|Papillomaviruses (PVs) are a {{large family}} of small DNA viruses infecting mammals, reptiles, and birds. PV {{infection}} induces cell proliferation {{that may lead to}} the formation of orogenital or skin tumors. PV-induced cell proliferation has been related mainly to the expression of two small oncoproteins, E 6 and E 7. In mammalian PVs, E 6 contains two 70 -residue zinc-binding repeats, whereas E 7 consists of a natively unfolded N-terminal region followed by a zinc-binding domain which folds as an obligate homodimer. Here, we show that both the novel francolin bird PV <b>Francolinus</b> <b>leucoscepus</b> PV type 1 (FlPV- 1) and the chaffinch bird PV Fringilla coelebs PV contain unusual E 6 and E 7 proteins. The avian E 7 proteins contain an extended unfolded N terminus and a zinc-binding domain of reduced size, whereas the avian E 6 proteins consist of a single zinc-binding domain. A comparable single-domain E 6 protein may have existed in a common ancestor of mammalian and avian PVs. Mammalian E 6 C-terminal domains are phylogenetically related to those of single-domain avian E 6, whereas mammalian E 6 N-terminal domains seem to have emerged by duplication and subsequently diverged from the original ancestral domain. In avian and mammalian cells, both FlPV- 1 E 6 and FlPV- 1 E 7 were evenly expressed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Finally, samples of full-length FlPV- 1 E 6 and the FlPV- 1 E 7 C-terminal zinc-binding domain were prepared for biophysical analysis. Both constructs were highly soluble and well folded, according to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements. status: publishe...|$|E
