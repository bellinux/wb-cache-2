25|$|Corporate {{computer}} environments {{may still}} {{make use of}} floppy disks for older machines that {{do not support the}} current company networks and, in the case of laptops, where Wi-Fi is not considered secure. The floppy disk provides for a controlled means of file transfer by permitting only a few files to be transmitted. This is as USB ports on enterprise computer terminals/workstations are often disabled in order to prevent employees from using a flash memory drive to take large amounts of data for unauthorized use. The capacity limit and low transfer speed of the floppy disk are advantages in this case. In addition, the loss of a floppy disk has less consequence than the loss of any modern piece of removable flash storage, and furthermore, the floppy disk, being much larger than most <b>flash</b> <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> formatssome of which are smaller than a fingernailis harder to lose.|$|E
