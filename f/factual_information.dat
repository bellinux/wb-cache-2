5|$|Following the McIntosh-Prescott Report, which {{indicated}} the long-term faults {{with the class}} that still required solving, successful {{efforts were made to}} bring the submarines to operational standard. As part of this, a public relations plan was implemented to provide up-to-date information on the submarines to the media, to improve the public perception of the class by providing <b>factual</b> <b>information</b> on the status of the project and responding to queries and incidents. This same period saw the dispelling of the idea, widely held within the RAN, that the Collins-class boats would be like any other vessel previously ordered by the RAN: in service with another navy, well tested, and with all the problems solved before they entered Australian hands. The RAN began to realise that as the parent navy for the class, they had a greater responsibility than normal in ensuring that the boats were at an operational standard.|$|E
5|$|Little <b>factual</b> <b>information</b> survives about Vespasian's {{government}} {{during the}} ten years he was Emperor. Vespasian spent his first year as a ruler in Egypt, during which {{the administration of the}} empire was given to Mucianus, aided by Vespasian's son Domitian. Modern historians believe that Vespasian remained there in order to consolidate support from the Egyptians. In mid-70, Vespasian first came to Rome and immediately embarked on a widespread propaganda campaign to consolidate his power and promote the new dynasty. His reign is best known for financial reforms following the demise of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, such as the institution of the tax on urinals, and the numerous military campaigns fought during the 70s. The most significant of these was the First Jewish-Roman War, which ended in the destruction of the city of Jerusalem by Titus. In addition, Vespasian faced several uprisings in Egypt, Gaul and Germania, and reportedly survived several conspiracies against him. Vespasian helped rebuild Rome after the civil war, adding a temple to peace and beginning construction of the Flavian Amphitheatre, better known as the Colosseum. Vespasian died of natural causes on June 23, 79, and was immediately succeeded by his eldest son Titus. The ancient historians that lived through the period such as Tacitus, Suetonius, Josephus and Pliny the Elder speak well of Vespasian while condemning the emperors that came before him.|$|E

40|$|It is {{consensus}} that the teaching of biology should be centered in evolution. However, there is still great difficulties to defragment the different areas of biological knowledge in order to study them under an evolutionary perspective. Influences of the external environment and incorrect interpretations of this issue affect the way science is understood within the classroom, contributing to a minor and compartmentalized learning, based mainly on memorization. Biology must be treated in a historical-philosophical context, allowing the student to transcend the <b>factual</b> <b>informations</b> and to reach the reasoning underlying them. Aiming to circumvent these difficulties, we discuss here {{how to work the}} teaching of evolution as the guiding principle of the biological sciences through the fundamental concepts of phylogenetic systematics (common ancestry, homology and the notion of geological time). Our goal is to deconstruct the personalized and simplistic widespread view of science and to show an alternative to rethink the teaching of biology from the perspective of evolution...|$|R

We selected 10 topics related to subjectivity with analysis of “narratives”, and investigated improvements of ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) and BE (Basic Elements) scores with our approach. In addition, the <b>factual</b> aspect of <b>information</b> needs was also investigated. ...|$|R

25|$|Acetylcholine {{has been}} implicated in {{learning}} and memory in several ways. The anticholinergic drug, scopolamine, impairs acquisition of new information in humans and animals.

40|$|Symposium "New Developments in South Italian Archaeology The Contexts of Apulian and Lucanian pottery", University of Cincinnati Classics Dept, 12 - 14 novembre 2009; actes à paraître. In {{the vast}} {{universe}} of South Italian pottery, the <b>factual</b> <b>informations</b> on {{the composition and}} on the localization of the red-figured workshops are scarce; two vase-painters only, Asteas and Python, signed their name, and are considered with reasonable probability to have been established at Paestum. The other mostly owe their existence and identity to Trendall's stylistic constructions and conventional names. Among {{the most important of}} them, both for the volume of his production and {{for his role in the}} development of Early South Italian red-figure, is the Amykos painter, named from the scene on a fine hydria in the Cabinet des Médailles, Paris. Fragments attributed to his hand have been discovered in 1973 in the archaeological excavations of the Metaponto kerameikos, confirmating thus him as working in this city, as were a little later the Dolon or Creusa Painters. But to cross efficiently these archeaological data with the stylistic data, one has to re-evaluate the painter's production as determinated by A. D. Trendall...|$|R

25|$|As {{described}} above, {{patients with}} anterograde amnesia {{have a wide}} range of forgetfulness. Declarative memory can be further subdivided into episodic and semantic memory.
