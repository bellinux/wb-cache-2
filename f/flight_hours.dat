40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis is {{an analysis of}} current methods used to predict flying hour expenditures for budget formulation and execution purposes. This study explains, compares and contrasts the methods for determining Cost per (<b>Flight)</b> <b>Hour</b> (CPH) among the aviation Type Commanders (COMNAVAIRPAC/COMNAVAIRLANT) as well as representatives {{from the office of}} the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV). While an overview of the individual techniques for <b>flight</b> <b>hour</b> costing lays the groundwork for this thesis, the focus of the work is on the differences in CPH formulation, variances in eventual products, and the consequences of these variances. An analysis of recently-emerging problems associated with the <b>Flight</b> <b>Hour</b> Program (FHP) and their potential significance in an era of reduced military funding is included, Additional information on the administrative programs instituted to computerize aircraft maintenance and <b>flight</b> <b>hour</b> documentation is also presented, {{as well as some of}} the implications of transitioning to a "paperless Navy.

5|$|The {{airframe}} is of semi-monocoque structure constructed {{primarily of}} aluminium alloys. High strength steel and titanium alloys are partially adopted in some critical areas. The airframe {{is designed for}} a service life of 4,000 <b>flight</b> <b>hours</b> or 25 years, the first overhaul being due at 1,200 <b>flight</b> <b>hours.</b> Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the airframe to reduce weight. The retractable undercarriage has a tricycle arrangement with a single steerable nose-wheel and two main undercarriages. The hydraulic brakes have an automatic anti-skid system.

This proved advantageous when the aircraft's mission changed from solely air-to-air combat to multi-role operations. Changes in operational use and additional systems have increased weight, necessitating multiple structural strengthening programs.|$|E

5|$|Despite the improvements, the {{in-service}} {{rates for}} the F-84E remained poor with {{less than half of}} the aircraft operational at any given time. This was primarily due to a severe shortage of spares for the Allison engines. The expectation was that F-84Es would fly 25 hours per month, accumulating 100 hours between engine overhauls. The actual <b>flight</b> <b>hours</b> for Korean War and NATO deployments rapidly outpaced the supply and Allison's ability to manufacture new engines. The F-84E was withdrawn from USAF service in 1956, lingering with ANG units until 1959.|$|E
