5000|$|The false <b>jacopever</b> or Cape redfish (Sebastes capensis) is {{a marine}} fish {{belonging}} to the family Sebastidae. [...] Found only in waters off the western coast of South Africa, Tristan da Cunha and southern South America, S. capensis lives in depths of 20 to 275 m. It reaches up to 37 cm in length, and is reddish or brownish with 5-6 pale spots on {{the upper part of}} the body. It has extremely prominent eyes. It mainly feeds on mysids.|$|E
50|$|The drum line {{consists}} of a floating drum (a barrel) with two lines attached to it. One line is attached to an anchor on the sea floor, while the other features a large baited shark hook. The drum is filled with a rigid polyurethane foam, which keeps it buoyant and prevents it from being stolen {{for use as a}} storage vessel. To attract sharks, the hooks are baited with red mullet and false <b>jacopever.</b> Since the objective of the drum line is to prevent sharks from approaching popular beaches (and not to attract them) only about 500 grams of bait is added to each hook. Thus sharks are only attracted to the baits from the immediate vicinity.|$|E
40|$|A semi-quantitative {{assessment}} {{is made of}} the animals observed in archived videotapes taken from the research submersible Jago, during diamond mining and exploratory surveys off {{the mouth of the}} Orange River on the west coast of southern Africa (28 ° 15 ′S, 29 ° 11 ′S) in November 1996. The seabed environment is described and nekton associations with substratum features are identified. The area is characterized by heterogeneity to its physical and biological struture. The variety of observed nekton is low, and communities are dominated by goby Sufflogobius bibarbatus, juvenile hake Merluccius spp. and cuttlefish Sepia spp. (on soft substrata), as well as false <b>jacopever</b> Sebastes capensis and kingklip Genypterus capensis (on rocky substrata). ...|$|E
40|$|Videotapes {{collected}} by the research submersible Jago in the Benguela ecosystem during spring 1997 were analyzed to determine demersal nekton assemblage composition, fish behavior, and microscale habitat association, and habitat selection. Demersal fish assemblage diversity was generally low, and their composition was a function of substratum type. Individual species showed an often marked association with either rocky or soft substrata (or both), and a strong or weak selection for the associated biota. Soles and dragonets actively selected areas of bioactive soft substrata, {{to which they are}} behaviorally and morphologically adapted. False <b>jacopever</b> were associated with crevices in areas of high-relief rocky substrata. Kingklip are piscivorous and were largely confined to holes at the base of rocks and favored areas without a conspicuous epifauna. Juvenile hake and gobies avoided extremely rocky areas and were largely indifferent to the presence of benthic invertebrates—behavior that is consistent with their planktonic diets. These results represent the first direct observations of demersal nekton in the region and are important because they allow better interpretations of the results of trawl studies...|$|E

Available online 7 February 2006. Abstract Trypsins {{from the}} pyloric ceca of <b>jacopever</b> (Sebastes schlegelii), TR-J, and elkhorn sculpin (Alcichthys alcicornis), TR-E, were purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S- 200 and Sephadex G- 50. The molecular weights of TR-J and TR-E were {{estimated to be}} 24, 000 Da by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. TR-J and TR-E revealed optimum temperatures of 60 and 50 °C, respectively, and showed the same optimum pH (pH 8. 0) for hydrolysis of Nα-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester. TR-J and TR-E were unstable at above 50 and 40 °C, respectively, and were more stable at alkaline pH than at acidic pH. Thermal stabilities of TR-J and TR-E were highly calcium dependent. These purified trypsin enzymes were inhibited by serine protease inhibitors, such as TLCK and soybean trypsin inhibitor. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of TR-J and TR-E were also investigated. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of TR-J, IVGGYECKPYSQPHQVSLNS, and TR-E, IVGGYECTPHSQAHQVSLNS, were found, and these sequences showed highly homology to other fish trypsins.
