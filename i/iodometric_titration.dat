50|$|A redox {{titration}} {{is a type}} of titration {{based on}} a redox reaction between the analyte and titrant. Redox titration may involve the use of a redox indicator and/or a potentiometer. A common example of a redox titration is treating a solution of iodine with a reducing agent to produce iodide using a starch indicator to help detect the endpoint. Iodine (I2) can be reduced to iodide (I&minus;) by e.g. thiosulfate (S2O32&minus;), and when all iodine is spent the blue colour disappears. This is called an <b>iodometric</b> <b>titration.</b>|$|E
50|$|Complexometric titrations {{rely on the}} {{formation}} of a complex between the analyte and the titrant. In general, they require specialized complexometric indicators that form weak complexes with the analyte. The most common example is the use of starch indicator to increase the sensitivity of <b>iodometric</b> <b>titration,</b> the dark blue complex of starch with iodine and iodide being more visible than iodine alone. Other complexometric indicators are Eriochrome Black T for the titration of calcium and magnesium ions, and the chelating agent EDTA used to titrate metal ions in solution.|$|E
50|$|Most {{often of}} all, the {{reduction}} of iodine to iodide is the last step {{in a series of}} reactions where the initial reactions are used to convert an unknown amount of the solute (the substance being analyzed) to an equivalent amount of iodine, which may then be titrated. Sometimes other halogens (or haloalkanes) than iodine are used in the intermediate reactions because they are available in better measurable standard solutions and/or react more readily with the solute. The extra steps in <b>iodometric</b> <b>titration</b> may be worth while because the equivalence point, where the blue turns a bit colourless, is more distinct than some other analytical or may be by volumetric methods.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{focus of}} this chapter is to {{introduce}} the perovskite structure, beginning from the ideal cubit perovskite with the ABX 3 formula unit. The concept of introducing long range ordering into the material are then presented along with the driving forces behind {{the extension of the}} structure. Possible magnetic ordering and solid solutions of perovskites are then presented. This is followed by the introduction of how theoretical chemistry can provide useful information to investigations and begin to predict how new materials can be made and is followed by a summary of the techniques commonly used. Methods: This chapter introduces the experimental methods used within this thesis, along with a description of the diffraction techniques used in the characterisation of oxide materials; including x-ray and neutron diffraction, <b>iodometric</b> <b>titrations</b> and the basic concepts behind Mössbauer spectroscopy. The second part to the chapter provides details on density functional theory (DFT) and force field (FF) calculations that are used throughout the thesis for the prediction of new materials. Chapter 3 : Details the use of a series of calculations with DFT on the chemical substitution in the YBa 2 Fe 3 -xMxO 8 (where M = Co, Ni and Mn), where the calculations are first tested on doping with Co, where it has been previously been experimentally reported. Calculations for un-reported substitutions a new compound is predicted. Synthetic investigations are then undertaken across the series, and a new material found where DFT calculations predict a new compound. Characterisation of the new material reveals that it has a crystal structure in good agreement with the structure predicted by DFT. Chapter 4 : Computationally investigates doping in the YBa 2 Ca 2 Fe 5 -xMxO 13 (M = Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Ti and Zn) solid oxide fuel cell cathode material using DFT. The results from the calculations predict stable doping for Cu and Co, with small doping levels favoured for M = Ni and Zn, with M = Mn yielding results predicting marginal doping and doping not favoured at all for M = Ti.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis focuses on the effect on structure and properties of the cubic perovskite system, Ba 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 Co 0. 8 Fe 0. 2 O 3 -δ (BSCF), when Mo 6 + partially substitutes the B-site elements (Co, Fe). BSCF is a candidate cathode material for intermediate temperature (500 - 750 oC) solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs), showing promising electrochemical activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Doping of the parent material BSCF with Mo 6 + targeted the retention of the cathodic performance whilst improving the reported structural thermal instability and incompatibility issues with commonly used electrolytes. A range of Ba 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 Co 0. 8 -xFe 0. 2 -yMox+yO 3 -δ (BSCFM) compositions were synthesised, with variation to the Mo content and the Co/Fe ratio. Characterization {{was carried out by}} a combination of diffraction and microscopy techniques. It was found that the introduction of Mo 6 + into the BSCF perovskite system favored the formation of perovskite structures with double the lattice parameters of the parent BSCF compound; these are referred as double perovskite (DP) phases to distinguish them from the single perovskite (SP) counterparts. The doubling of the unit cell was attributed to B-site ordering between Mo 6 + and Co 2 + due to the considerable difference in cation size and charge. The SP and DP phases coexisted in all the BSCFM compositions studied, with increasing DP volume as the Mo 6 + content was increased. The structural and electrochemical characterisation was focused on the composition Ba 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 Co 0. 5 Fe 0. 125 Mo 0. 375 O 3 -δ, (abbreviated as BSCFMo 0. 375 -(Co/Fe= 4) which demonstrated favourable stability and compatibility properties with state the of the art electrolyte SDC (Sm 0. 2 Ce 0. 8 O 2 -δ), which was used in this study. It also displayed the best electrochemical performance among the BSCFM compositions studied by AC impedance measurements in air; an area specific resistance (ASR) of 0. 13 Ω. cm 2 was obtained at 650 oC. As observed from AC impedance measurements under variable oxygen partial pressure (pO 2) environments for this composition, the activity of the ORR was found to be limited primarily by oxygen chemical exchange. The full structural analysis of the biphasic BSCFMo 0. 375 -(Co/Fe= 4) was a great challenge and was performed by combined refinement using Neutron and X-ray data and double-checked by a range of methods including microscopy techniques, Mössbauer spectroscopy, <b>iodometric</b> <b>titrations</b> and thermogravimetric analysis. The optimal performance of BSCFMo 0. 375 -(Co/Fe= 4) among the BSCFM compositions studied was attributed to the synergistic effect of the major DP (70 % by weight) phase, which was found to be an oxygen-stoichiometric Co 2 +,Mo 6 +-rich, Fe 3 +-poor compound, with the minor SP (30 % by weight) Co 3 +,Fe 3 +-rich, Mo 6 +-poor component with significant oxygen vacancy concentration...|$|R

40|$|Savannah River Remediation (SRR) is {{evaluating}} {{an alternate}} flowsheet for the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) using glycolic acid as a reductant. An {{important aspect of}} the development of the glycolic acid flowsheet is determining if glycolate has any detrimental downstream impacts. Testing was performed to determine if there is any impact to the strontium and actinide sorption by monosodium titanate (MST) and modified monosodium titanate (mMST) or if there is an impact to the cesium removal at the Modular Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction Processing Unit (MCU). Sorption testing was performed using both MST and modified MST (mMST) in the presence of 5, 000 and 10, 000 ppm (mass basis) glycolate. 10, 000 ppm is the estimated bounding concentration expected in the DWPF recycle stream based on DWPF melter flammable gas model results. The presence of glycolate was found to slow the removal of Sr and Pu by MST, while increasing the removal rate of Np. Results indicate that the impact is a kinetic effect, and the overall capacity of the material is not affected. There was no measurable effect on U removal at either glycolate concentration. The slower removal rates for Sr and Pu at 5, 000 and 10, 000 ppm glycolate could result in lower DF values for these sorbates in ARP based on the current (12 hours) and proposed (8 hours) contact times. For the highest glycolate concentration used in this study, the percentage of Sr removed at 6 hours of contact decreased by 1 % and the percentage of Pu removed decreased by nearly 7 %. The impact may prove insignificant if the concentration of glycolate that is returned to the tank farm is well below the concentrations tested in this study. The presence of glycolate also decreased the removal rates for all three sorbates (Sr, Pu, and Np) by mMST. Similarly to MST, the results for mMST indicate that the impact is a kinetic effect, and the overall capacity of the material is not affected. The presence of glycolate did not change the lack of affinity of mMST for U. Pre-contacting the MST or mMST with glycolate did not {{have a significant effect on}} the performance of the materials when compared to tests having the same concentration of glycolate present in the simulant. These findings suggest that the glycolate is likely influencing removal by sorbate complexation and not by depositing onto or forming a film on the surface of the MST solids. Since the DF values are salt batch dependent, it is not possible to a priori quantify the impacts of glycolate on future processing campaigns. However, we recommend that the impacts of glycolate be evaluated during each salt batch qualification when a final processing concentration is defined, and recommendations can then be made on how to mitigate negative impacts, if needed. Impacts to the performance of the MST or mMST could be mitigated by increasing contact time or increasing sorbent concentrations. In addition to the MST and mMST testing, testing was performed to determine if there is an impact to the cesium removal at Modular Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction Processing Unit (MCU). An Extraction-Scrub-Strip (ESS) test routine was used to simulate cesium removal at the MCU. For this, SRNL performed three ESS tests, using the same basic aqueous waste simulant and solvent. For one test, SRNL added 5, 000 ppm (mass basis) of glycolate and added 10, 000 ppm of glycolate to a second test. A control test contained no glycolate. The results of all three tests were virtually identical for all the extraction, scrub and strip tests. (A single data point in the 5, 000 ppm test is physically impossible and SRNL is currently resolving this obvious error.) At this time, SRNL concludes that the presence of up to 10, 000 ppm of glycolate does not affect cesium removal by the current solvent system used in the MCU. Although not tested, the impact of glycolate for the Next Generation Solvent - that replaces BOBCalixC 6 with MaxCalix - is expected to be very similar to that for the baseline solvent. Testing is needed to confirm. Additional testing is recommended to both further examine the nature of the interaction of glycolate with MST and mMST and also to help address some postulated risks on ARP/MCU operations with implementation of the glycolate flowsheet. The additional testing includes FTIR and Raman spectroscopy to examine the surface of the MST and mMST particles, <b>iodometric</b> <b>titrations</b> to determine the peroxide content in the mMST before and after exposure to glycolate, particle size measurements of the MST and mMST from the experiments performed with glycolate, and measurements of soluble Ti in the supernate from these glycolate experiments. With regards to MCU impacts, the following tests are also recommended based on the premortem risk assessment...|$|R
