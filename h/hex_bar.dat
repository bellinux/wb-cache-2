50|$|The flats of a hex shank {{can either}} be {{machined}} on a round shank, as in the photograph, or be the natural flats of <b>hex</b> <b>bar</b> stock. A hex shank can be grasped by a 3-jaw drill chuck or held in a chuck specifically for hex shanks. Quarter-inch hex shanks are common for machine screwdriver bits and have spread from that application {{to be used for}} drill bits that are compatible with screwdriver machinery.|$|E
5000|$|Most metal {{produced}} by a steel mill or aluminium plant is formed (via rolling or extrusion) into long continuous strips of various size and shape. These strips are cut at regular intervals and allowed to cool, each segment becoming a piece of bar stock. A good analogy is pasta-making, in which lumps of dough are extruded into various cross-sectional shapes; cut into lengths; and then dried in that form. The cross-sectional shapes of pasta vary from simple bar or tube shapes (such as linguine or penne) to more elaborate extrusions (such as rotelle, fiori, or rotini). The {{same is true of}} metal bar stock. The most common shapes are round bar (also called rod), rectangular bar (including square bar, the special case of equal sides), and hexagonal bar (usually called <b>hex</b> <b>bar</b> for short). Tube and pipe are similar, but have hollow centers and are traditionally not called [...] "bar" [...] in industrial usage. (However, a product called hollow bar, essentially tube but with custom-orderable OD and ID and thus custom wall thickness, is marketed for lathe bar work which can benefit from obviation of drilling and rough boring.) Also similar in concept, but not called [...] "bar", are the common structural shapes such as angle stock and channel stock. These are commonly available in steel and aluminum; the names [...] "angle iron" [...] and [...] "channel iron" [...] are still commonly used (informally) even though their literal namesake, wrought iron, has been replaced by steel and aluminum for most uses.|$|E
5000|$|Season 1, Episodes 14&15 Original Airdates 12/08/03 12/15/03Built for Snap-on tools, the [...] "Tool Bike" [...] {{incorporated}} several unfinished and untempered tools {{supplied to}} OCC by Snap-on. The frame was created using solid <b>hex</b> shaped metal <b>bars</b> (inspired by allen wrenches) {{instead of the}} more typical round tubing. The metal bars were hollowed out and bent by [...] "Racing Innovations" [...] resulting in a heavier than normal frame. Following the [...] "allen wrench" [...] theme, Paul Jr. bent sheets of 16 gauge cold rolled steel to create hex shaped exhaust covers. A fake oil tank {{was made in the}} shape of a miniature toolbox (the real oil tank was hidden on the bottom of the frame). The entire bike was sprayed with Snap-on's official red paint. As a hidden detail, an authentic ratchet was modified and used as kickstand.|$|R
50|$|The Traxxas Slash was {{introduced}} in 2008 and is a two-wheel drive 1/10 scale short course electric race truck. This Traxxas model comes Ready-To-Run (RTR). The Slash shares many of its parts with the Rustler, Stampede and Bandit. Differences include a raised chassis (though {{not as high as}} the Stampede's) that is also much longer, wider and rectangular, 4.3 inch (diameter) x 1.7 inch (width) all-terrain style tires mounted on 2.2/3.0 inch wheels (now a point in short course rc trucks), though first production runs did sell with the non-sc style wheel (2.2) traxxas believed it would save on production to use the 2.2/3.0 design from the slayer, with a 12mm hex. Out-of-the-box this car features a TITAN 12 turn motor. The 2.2/3.0 design was to clear the slayers revo-spec pillow ball suspension components, Traxxas high current battery connectors, metal transmission gears, new waterproof XL-5 ESC, Waterproof 2075 steering servo, 4 channel micro receiver, sealed water tight receiver box, adjustable camber links, rubber sealed ball bearings, nerf <b>bars,</b> <b>hex</b> hardware, light duty drive shaft yokes, new battery hold-downs, short-course truck style bumpers, progressive rate springs, and a wide short course truck style body that encompasses the tires are some of its features. The claimed top speed is about 20+MPH.|$|R
40|$|The deadlift {{comprises}} eccentric and concentric {{phases of}} muscle activation, and is routinely used by sportsmen {{as the basis}} of strength and power training for the back and legs. One of the issues involved in performing the deadlift, is the strain it places on the lower spine. The deadlift is traditionally performed using the Olympic barbell. There is strong anecdotal evidence that the newly introduced Troy <b>Hex</b> <b>bar</b> reduces the strain on the lower back, and it is routinely used in America in preference to the Olympic barbell in training programmes. This has not however, been proven objectively. The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the kinematic and electromyographical differences between deadlifts performed using the Olympic barbell and the Troy-Hex bar. With institutional ethical approval, six rugby union players with experience in performing deadlifts (mean¼ 3 years, s¼ 1. 2) were recruited as participants. Each subject performed three deadlifts using the Olympic bar and three using the Troy-Hex bar. Three participants performed the deadlift with the Olympic bar first and three performed the deadlift with the Troy-Hex bar first. Participants were allowed 10 min rest between sets. The weight lifted was set at the subject’s individual six repetition maximum. Video data were obtained from a high definition camera from a lateral iewpoint. A kinematic analysis was undertaken to examine the displacement of the bar, the centre of mass of the subject, and the angles of the spine, hips and knees at key positions. Surface electromyography electrodes were fitted above the right erector spinae, and electrical activity was sampled at 500 Hz. The mean muscle activation for the ascent and descent phases was calculated, and compared. Erector spinae activation during the descent and ascent phases was found to be significantly less (P 50. 05) when using the Troy-Hex bar. Significant differences (P 50. 05) were also found between the angles of the trunk, hip, knee angles at key positions. Results indicate a more erect trunk position was maintained throughout the deadlift performed using the Troy-Hex bar, reflected in reduced erector spinae muscle activation during both the ascent and descent phase of the lift, suggesting a safer method of lifting. Serious consideration therefore needs to be given to the use of the Troy-Hex bar when performing deadlifts as part of strength and conditioning training programmes...|$|E
