40|$|Background: Gingival {{reconstruction}} {{has recently}} become a routine {{part of the}} periodontal treatment. <b>Gingival</b> <b>grafting</b> is considered as predictable procedure for root coverage {{with a high degree}} of cosmetic enhancement for attached tissue augmentation and for preprosthetic treatment. Mucogingival surgery includes pedicle flaps and free <b>gingival</b> <b>grafts</b> or connective tissue grafts. These procedures are accompanied by donor site pain. NSAIDs are successfully used to affect this pain. Aulin and Ibuprofen have good analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. Their main pharmacological action includes inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis via COX- 2, reduction of cytokine-induced hyperalgesia by suppressing TNF-± and the synthesis of proteinase enzymes (MMPs) ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A new fibrin {{adhesive}} made {{of buffalo}} plasma-derived fibrinogen and a thrombin-like snake venom enzyme, {{has been successfully}} used to immobilize free <b>gingival</b> <b>grafts.</b> This case series histologically compared sutured grafts (control group) with others immobilized by using the fibrin adhesive (experimental group). CASE DESCRIPTION: The grafts {{were placed in the}} contralateral mandibular bicuspids of 15 patients, so that each subject received one treatment of each type. Five biopsies of each group were collected at 7, 14 and 45 days of healing, which were histologically and morphometrically analyzed as regards the relative volume density of the different connective tissue components. RESULTS: The sites in the control group presented a higher inflammatory cell density at 7 days and a tendency towards a lower collagen density. In the experimental group, the grafts had an appearance of more advanced healing. Tissue maturity characteristics progressed until 14 and 45 days, but no difference between groups could be noted at these times. Conclusions: Within the limits of the present study, it may be suggested that the alternative fibrin adhesive tested could represent an alternative to sutures in <b>gingival</b> <b>grafts</b> procedures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{controlled}} clinical trial was to compare the efficacy of two surgical approaches to protect the regenerated tissue following membrane removal in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) treated intrabony defects. Twenty-eight (28) defects, one each in 28 patients were randomly assigned after placement of the membrane {{to one of two}} treatment groups by blocking to prognostic variables. The test group received free <b>gingival</b> <b>grafts</b> on the interproximal regenerated tissue. In the control group the surgical flaps were coronally positioned over the regenerated tissue. The two groups were well balanced with respect to all prognostic variables. The results indicated that: 1) similar amounts of regenerated tissue were obtained in the two groups at membrane removal (7. 6 +/- 2. 8 mm, test; 8. 3 +/- 2. 3 mm, control); 2) a significantly greater amount of probing attachment level gain was observed in the test group (5. 0 +/- 2. 1 mm, test; 3. 7 +/- 2. 1 mm, control).

40|$|The use of intra-oral soft-tissue-engineered devices has {{demonstrated}} potential for oral mucosa regeneration. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the temporal expression of angiogenic biomarkers during wound healing of soft tissue reconstructive procedures comparing living cellular constructs (LCC) with autogenous free <b>gingival</b> <b>grafts.</b> Forty-four human participants bilaterally lacking sufficient zones of attached keratinized gingiva were randomly assigned to soft tissue surgery plus either LCC or autograft. Wound fluid samples were collected at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 post-operatively and analyzed for a panel of angiogenic biomarkers: angiogenin (ANG), angiostatin (ANT), PDGF-BB, VEGF, FGF- 2, IL- 8, TIMP- 1, TIMP- 2, GM-CSF, and IP- 10. Results demonstrated a significant increase in expression of ANT, PDGF-BB, VEGF, FGF- 2, and IL- 8 for the LCC group over the autograft group at the early stages of wound repair. Although angiogenic biomarkers were modestly elevated for the LCC group, no clinical correlation with wound healing was found. This human investigation demonstrates that, during early wound-healing events, expression of angiogenic-related biomarkers is up-regulated in sites treated with LCC compared with autogenous free <b>gingival</b> <b>grafts,</b> which may provide a safe and effective alternative for regenerating intra-oral soft tissues (ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT 01134081) ...|$|R

40|$|Background. Severely resorbed mandibles often {{present a}} short band of {{keratinized}} tissue {{associated with a}} shallow vestibule. As a result, prominent muscle insertions are present, especially in the mental region of the mandible. This case report describes the deepening of the vestibular sulcus in an atrophic mandible by combining free <b>gingival</b> <b>grafts</b> harvested from the palate and a postoperative acrylic resin stent screwed on osseointegrated implants placed at the anterior region of the mandible. Study design. During the second-stage surgery, a split-thickness labial flap was reflected and apically sutured onto the periosteum. Two free <b>gingival</b> <b>grafts</b> were obtained and then sutured at this recipient site. A previously custom-made acrylic stent was then screwed onto the most distally positioned implants. To document the procedure`s stability over time, a metal ball {{was placed in the}} most apical part of the vestibule and standardized cephalometric radiographs were taken before and 6 months after the procedure. Linear measurements of vestibular depths over the observation time were realized using specific software for radiographic analysis. Results. The proposed technique augmented the band of attached masticatory mucosa, deepened the vestibule and prevented the muscle reinsertion. The difference between the 2 measurements of vestibular depths was 9. 39 mm (initial 20. 88 mm, final 11. 49 mm) after a 6 -month postoperative period. Conclusion. The technique, in combination with palatal mucosal graft and use of a postoperative stent, decreased the pull of mentalis muscle and provided a peri-implantally stable soft tissue around implants.

50|$|Gum grafting, {{also known}} as a <b>gingival</b> <b>graft</b> or {{periodontal}} plastic surgery, is a surgical procedure to reverse gum recession. Gum recession exposes the roots of teeth, which can lead to sensitivity and put teeth at a higher risk of damage or disease due to the loosening of their attachment within the gums and bones of the jaw. Should gum recession continue, bone and keratinized tissue will be at a greater risk of being damaged and permanently lost around the teeth. The aim of a gum graft is to extend keritinized tissue of the gums to cover tooth roots, which restores their firm placement within the jaw and prevents further damage.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to {{the free}} <b>gingival</b> <b>graft,</b> the SECT graft can be {{described}} as a free autogenous graft. The term free describes how the graft is completely removed from the donor site rather than remaining attached via a pedicle. The term autogenous, from the Greek root auto- ("self"), describes how the individual who receives the graft is the same individual who provides the donor tissue. [...] The connective tissue is generally taken from the hard palate, although it may be taken from other sites as well, such as the maxillary tuberosity area. Because the connective tissue for the graft is transplanted without the superficial epithelium from the donor site, it is termed subepithelial.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on {{the shape}} of the gum {{recession}} and the levels of bone around the teeth, areas of gum recession can be regenerated with new gum tissue using a variety of gum grafting [...] "periodontal plastic surgery" [...] procedures performed by a specialist in periodontics (a periodontist). These procedures are typically completed under local anesthesia with or without conscious sedation, as the patient prefers. This may involve repositioning of adjacent gum tissue to cover the recession (called a pedicle graft) or use of a free graft of gingival or connective tissue from the roof of the mouth (called a free <b>gingival</b> <b>graft</b> or a Subepithelial connective tissue graft). Alternatively, a material called acellular dermal matrix (processed donated human skin allograft) may be used instead of tissue from the patient's own palate.|$|E

40|$|Connective tissue grafts {{have been}} used {{successfully}} {{in the treatment of}} gingival recession. In the mid 80 s and late 90 s, the periodontal literature presented various techniques such as free <b>gingival</b> <b>grafts,</b> pedicle flaps, subepithelial connective tissue grafts, acellular dermal matrix grafts, and guided tissue regeneration to cover denuded root surfaces. Currently, connective tissue grafting is a reliable treatment for esthetic root coverage. This paper presents a qualitative assessment of a surgical technique that uses a connective tissue graft, including a portion of epithelium {{in the shape of the}} defect. This procedure enhances the healing of the covered root surface, increases the thickness of the soft tissue and improves esthetics.

500|$|Success {{or failure}} of {{implants}} depends {{on the health of}} the person receiving the treatment, drugs which affect the chances of osseointegration, and the health of the tissues in the mouth. The amount of stress that will be put on the implant and fixture during normal function is also evaluated. Planning the position and number of implants is key to the long-term health of the prosthetic since biomechanical forces created during chewing can be significant. The position of implants is determined by the position and angle of adjacent teeth, by lab simulations or by using computed tomography with CAD/CAM simulations and surgical guides called stents. The prerequisites for long-term success of osseointegrated dental implants are healthy bone and gingiva. Since both can atrophy after tooth extraction, pre-prosthetic procedures such as sinus lifts or <b>gingival</b> <b>grafts</b> are sometimes [...] required to recreate ideal bone and gingiva.|$|R

40|$|Background: Owing to its {{stimulatory effect}} on {{angiogenesis}} and epithelialization, platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) {{is an excellent}} material for enhancing wound healing. The use of PRF dressings may be a simple and effective method of reducing the morbidity associated with donor sites of autogenous free <b>gingival</b> <b>grafts</b> (FGGs). The purpose of this case series is to document the beneficial role of PRF in the healing of FGG donor sites. Materials and Methods: A total of 18 patients treated with FGGs could be classified into two groups.

Post-operative healing was assessed clinically at 7, 14 and 21 days and the morbidity was assessed qualitatively by an interview. Results: Sites where PRF was used showed complete wound closure by 14 days and these patients reported lesser post-operative morbidity than patients in whom PRF was not used.

40|$|The {{health of}} the peri – implant tissues play an {{important}} {{in the long term}} outcome of dental implants. The absence of keratinized gingiva (KG) may be a risk factor for developing recession or peri –implantitis. However there is still ambiguity in the need for keratinized gingiva around dental implants. The preservation and reconstruction of soft tissue around dental implants is an integral component of dental Implantology. There is no long-term evidence whether augmented soft tissues can be maintained over time and are able to influence the peri-implant bone levels. Among the various soft tissue augmentation techniques Apically positioned flap with vestibuloplasty, Free <b>gingival</b> <b>grafts</b> and Connective tissue grafts are documented as the most predictable methods to increase the width of KG. Autogenous grafts increase the soft tissue thickness and improve aesthetics compared to non-grafted sites. The aim of this review is to critically discuss the need for KG around implants and the techniques to preserve and augment KG. It is difficult to arrive at a definitive conclusion due to scarcity of well designed studies in literature. Reliable evidence is lacking to suggest the ideal soft tissue augmentation/preservation techniques. Long term randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to provide a clearer image...|$|R
40|$|Many {{patients}} seek {{to pursue}} orthodontic treatment for esthetic improvement. These patients present with mal- {{alignment of the}} anterior teeth. There was strong correlation between the severity and extent of gingival recessions and past orthodontic treatment, {{it was suggested that}} orthodontic tooth movement may lead to gingival recession. The principal objective in the treatment of gingival recession is to cover the exposed root surfaces to improve es- thetics and to reduce hypersensitivity.

40|$|Introduction: Dentin {{hypersensitivity}} is {{a common}} condition of transient tooth pain associated {{with a variety of}} exogenous stimuli. The clinical cause of dentin hypersensitivity is exposed dentinal tubules as a result of gingival recession and subsequent loss of cementum on root surfaces. Two principal treatment strategies are used; Dentinal tubules can be covered by <b>gingival</b> <b>grafts</b> or dental restorations and desensitization of the nerve tissue can be done within the tubules using potassium nitrate. The Purpose {{of this study was to}} compare effect of two desensitizing agent nitrate potassium and sodium fluoride after peridontal surgery. Material and methods: In this clinical trial 12 patients that had peridontal surgery at minimum 3 quadrants, in each there was one sensitive tooth, were selected. The degree of sensitivity measured before using nitrate potassium and sodium fluoride the same as control group. Potassium and sodium fluoride gels used on the quadrants (upper or down. The degree of sensitivity measured after 7 and 14 days. Data analysis was done in SPSS software by Freedman and Willcoxon tests. Results: After 7 and 14 days in the all groups, decrease of sensitivity was statistically significant. But after 14 days, between three groups, there were no statistically significant differences. Conclusion: Even though using of nitrate potassium 3 % and sodium fluoride 2 % cause significant reduction of tooth sensitivity in a 2 weeks period but in compare to the control group did not show any superiority. Further study is needed to confirm this result. Key words: Dentin hypersensitivity, nitrate potassium, sodium fluoride, peridontal surger...|$|R
