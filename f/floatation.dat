25|$|The lateral {{processes}} on {{the larvae}} {{are believed to}} aid in <b>floatation</b> and buoyancy, allowing the larvae to breathe in their preferred semi-liquid media.|$|E
25|$|It {{was clear}} that {{alternative}} sources of finance were needed. A management buyout was explored and found to be not feasible. Preparations were made for a stock exchange <b>floatation</b> but, in the late 1980s Fulmer sustained large losses and plans to float were postponed.|$|E
25|$|Longitudinal {{centre of}} <b>floatation</b> (LCF) is the {{longitudinal}} distance {{from a point}} of reference (often midships) to {{the centre of the}} area of waterplane when the hull is not moving. This can be visualized as being the area defined by the water's surface and the hull.|$|E
25|$|In May, Stanley {{introduced}} Sherman to Gibson and to Glenvil Hall. Sherman {{sought a}} public <b>floatation</b> of Shermans Ltd but needed {{the permission of}} the Capital Issues Committee though neither politician was optimistic. Stanley also canvassed Key over some premises that he was attempting to sell to Sherman.|$|E
25|$|Vindex carried four Short Type 184 {{seaplanes}} {{and could}} also carry {{up to four}} Bristol Scout fighters. The Bristol Scout was a landplane on wheels and consequently {{at the end of}} a mission it would have to ditch and remain supported by <b>floatation</b> bags until it could be lifted back onboard by crane.|$|E
25|$|Capsizing in yachts {{can occur}} when water {{is able to}} {{infiltrate}} the hull and decrease the vessels water and buoyancy leading to capsizing. Yachts can be deployed with a <b>floatation</b> system which {{is a series of}} strategically placed lift bags within the interior of the hull increasing the vessel's buoyancy and filling void space where water can collect. Providing valuable time to remove the water, fix damage or evacuate.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{equipment}} can be equipped, dependent on operator choice and role; these include an external hoist, dual cargo hook, dual flight controls, baggage compartment extension, snow skis, windshield wipers, rotor brake, multi-band radios, active noise reduction headsets, soundproofing, oxygen systems, loud speakers, search lights, retractable landing light, emergency <b>floatation</b> equipment, reinforced windshield, wire strike protection system, rappelling kit, fire fighting belly tank, and a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera. Three fuel tanks, located behind the rear {{seats in the}} cabin, are installed as standard; up to two additional optional tanks can be fitted {{for a total of}} five, providing a flight endurance of nearly six hours.|$|E
25|$|In October 1946, Stanley {{approached}} fur-dealer Cyril Ross, {{the common}} acquaintance from the Manchester train, {{with a business}} proposition. Ross {{said that he would}} be interested in a multiple store such as J.Jones of Manchester. Stanley agreed to pursue the matter and also to get permission for <b>floatation</b> as a public company from the Capital Issues Committee. Stanley, somewhat prematurely, offered a directorship in J.Jones to Gibson who, owing to his position, turned it down. Ross had originally intended that Stanley would be remunerated by equity in the new company but he ultimately lost trust, largely because of the extortionate expenses that Stanley regularly claimed, and agreed only to a fee for the work.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} {{evolved in}} the years between World War I and World War II. Flight decks were installed on several different types of ships to explore the possibilities of operating naval aircraft without the performance limitations of <b>floatation</b> devices required for seaplanes and flying boats. The most successful of these early aircraft carriers were built from battlecruisers. Battlecruisers typically had a speed of about , which was several knots faster {{than the speed of}} contemporary battleships. Additional speed was not necessary for maintaining station with the battle fleet, but enabled the carrier {{to catch up with the}} battle fleet after temporarily leaving formation to turn into the wind for launch or recovery of aircraft. The speed of the carrier during launch effectively decreased the takeoff distance for embarked aircraft, so faster carriers could operate heavier aircraft with greater range and superior combat capability. As such naval aircraft became operational, no nation could risk fielding less capable aircraft; so the speed of later purpose-designed aircraft carriers was set by the speed of the converted battle cruisers. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the displacement of purpose-designed aircraft carriers to 23,000 tons.|$|E
25|$|Many {{lifeboats}} overturned while loading or lowering, spilling passengers {{into the}} sea; others were overturned by the ship's motion {{when they hit}} the water. It has been claimed that some boats, because of the negligence of some officers, crashed down onto the deck, crushing other passengers, and sliding down towards the bridge. This has been disputed by passenger and crew testimony. Some crewmen would lose their grip on ropes used to lower the lifeboats while trying to lower the boats into the ocean, and this caused the passengers to spill into the sea. Others tipped on launch as some panicking people jumped into the boat. Lusitania had 48 lifeboats, more than enough for all the crew and passengers, but only six were successfully lowered, all from the starboard side. Lifeboat 1 overturned as it was being lowered, spilling its original occupants into the sea, but it managed to right itself shortly afterwards and was later filled with people from in the water. Lifeboats 9 and 11 managed to reach the water safely with a few people, but both later picked up many swimmers. Lifeboats 13 and 15 also safely reached the water, each overloaded with around 70 people. Finally, Lifeboat 21 reached the water safely and cleared the ship moments before her final plunge. A few of her collapsible lifeboats washed off her decks as she sank and provided <b>floatation</b> for some survivors.|$|E
500|$|The walrus has an air sac {{under its}} throat which {{acts like a}} <b>floatation</b> bubble and allows it to bob {{vertically}} {{in the water and}} sleep. The males possess a large baculum (penis bone), up to [...] in length, the largest of any land mammal, both in absolute size and relative to body size.|$|E
500|$|Houlding's {{way around}} the problem was to propose a limited company with <b>floatation</b> of the club {{enabling}} the club to purchase Houlding's and Orrell's land outright, hoping to raise £12,000. Previous attempts to raise money from the community had failed miserably. This would have meant the club would need to find £6,000 in cash with an additional £4,875 mortgage. [...] The Everton Committee initially accepted Houlding's proposal in principle, yet voted against it at a meeting.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, 1994, 1996, 1998 and 2000, RMS Titanic Inc. {{carried out}} an {{intensive}} series of dives {{that led to}} the recovery of over 4,000 items in the first two expeditions alone. The 1996 expedition controversially attempted to raise a section of Titanic itself, a section of the outer hull that originally comprised part of the wall of two First Class cabins on C Deck, extending down to D Deck. It weighed 20 tons, measured [...] and had four portholes in it, three of which still had glass in them. The section had come loose either during the sinking or {{as a result of the}} impact with the sea bed. Its recovery using diesel-filled <b>floatation</b> bags was turned into something of an entertainment event with two cruise ships accompanying the expedition to the wreck site. Passengers were offered the chance, at $5,000 per person, to watch the recovery on television screens in their cabins while enjoying luxury accommodation, Las Vegas-style shows and casino gambling aboard the ships. Various celebrities were recruited to enliven the proceedings, including Burt Reynolds, Debbie Reynolds and Buzz Aldrin, and [...] "Grand Receptions" [...] for VIPs were scheduled on-shore where the hull section would be displayed. However, the lift ended disastrously when rough weather caused the ropes supporting the bags to snap. At the moment the ropes broke, the hull section had been lifted to within only [...] of the surface. It hurtled [...] back down, embedding itself upright on the sea floor. Although the attempt was strongly criticised by marine archaeologists, scientists and historians as a money-making publicity stunt, a second, successful attempt to lift the fragment was carried out in 1998. The so-called [...] "Big Piece" [...] was conserved in a laboratory in Santa Fe for two years before being put on display at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino.|$|E
2500|$|The end of coal trains {{from the}} {{colliery}} in 1973 allowed SVR {{to acquire a}} further 8 miles of the line as far as Foley Park, the purchase price of £74,000 being raised by the <b>floatation</b> of a public company initially under the chairmanship of Sir Gerald Nabarro. [...] Services were extended to Bewdley in May 1974.|$|E
2500|$|The fighter {{version of}} the VE-7 was {{designated}} VE-7S. It was a single-seater, the front cockpit being faired over and a [...] Vickers machine gun mounted over it {{on the left side}} and synchronized to fire through the propeller. Some planes, designated VE-7SF, had <b>floatation</b> gear consisting of inflatable bags stowed away, available to help keep the plane afloat when ditching at sea.|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} this series design was to {{simulate}} the weight and other external physical characteristics of the Apollo command module. These prototypes were in the 9000lb range for both laboratory water tanks and ocean tests. The experiments tested <b>floatation</b> collars, collar installations, and buoyancy characteristics. The Navy trained their recovery personnel for ocean collar installation and shipboard retrieval procedures. These boilerplates rarely had internal equipment.|$|E
2500|$|... 1959 September 9 - A Big Joe Atlas {{boilerplate}} Mercury (BJ-1) {{was successfully}} launched and flown from Cape Canaveral. This test flight {{was to determine}} the performance of the heat shield and heat transfer to the boilerplate, to observe flight dynamics of boilerplate during re-entry into the South Atlantic, to perform and evaluate capsule <b>floatation</b> and recovery system procedures, and to evaluate the entire capsule and rocket characters and system controls.|$|E
2500|$|Using {{the slogan}} [...] "The Vote, The Float", the Abbey National board overcame fierce {{opposition}} from some members and won approval with 90% of the vote; the society floated in 1989, becoming the Abbey bank. This {{was the first}} building society to make the move but it kicked off a general move which transformed British financial services. The <b>floatation</b> having been completed, Adamson retired after 13 years at Abbey in 1991.|$|E
2500|$|I will {{be forever}} indebted to Dan [...] for his {{companionship}} and inspiration. Indebted, too, {{because it was}} Dan who insisted on giving my name to the Wulff Series and gave me stature I might never have had otherwise. We were fishing together on the Esopus {{in the spring of}} 1930 when I was trying out some new flies I'd designed in revolt to the then available Catskill patterns. The new flies had bucktail wings and tails for better <b>floatation.</b> I had planned to call one of them the Bucktail Coachman. It was Dan who insisted that I call them Wulffs and he started tying them under that name— Lee Wulff in the tribute in Mist on the River-Remembrances of Dan Bailey.|$|E
2500|$|Airbus Helicopters has {{promoted}} the airframe's various configurations as possessing [...] "unique adaptability" [...] for various missions, including utility work, commercial transportation, and training roles. Equipment {{for the law}} enforcement role include external loudspeakers, rappelling system, search lights with laser pointers, left or right-mounted hoists, and electro-optical sensors. For offshore oil & gas operations, the rotorcraft can be fitted with weather/search radars, emergency <b>floatation</b> aids (including an automated external life raft), energy-absorbent seating, class-D certified external hoists, and crash-resistant fuel cells. An external hook can be installed to carry underslung loads of up to 272kg for cargo missions. In a training capacity, features such a light aircraft recording system (for post-flight analysis), intuitive human-machine interface, specific training modules, and a one-engine inoperative training mode, and full ground simulators, may be selected.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main cabin}} of the Super Puma, which is {{accessed}} via two sliding plug doors, used a reconfigurable floor arrangement, various passenger seating or cargo configurations can be adopted, including specialised configurations for medical operators. According to Airbus Helicopters, {{in addition to}} the two pilots, the short-fuselage AS332 can accommodate up to 15 passengers while the stretched-fuselage AS332 increases this to 20 passengers in a comfortable configuration. Soundproof upholstery is installed, as is separately-adjustable heating and ventilation systems. Along with the doors, 12 windows around the main cabin area are [...] for emergency exits. The lower fuselage can also be fitted with <b>floatation</b> gear. A hatch in the floor to access the cargo sling pole is present in the cabin, as is individual stowage space for airborne equipment.|$|E
2500|$|J. P. Morgan and H. B. Hollins {{were also}} {{business}} partners and the closest of friends until the former's death; Hollins {{was one of}} the men sent to pick up Morgan's body when it arrived aboard a ship from France. In fact Morgan's offices were located across the street from H. B. Hollins & Co.'s exclusive banking offices, at the southwest corner of Wall and Broad Streets. On November 13, 1913, H.B. Hollins & Co., one of Wall Street's most highly regarded houses failed in debt of $5,000,000. The failure of the house was related to a number of issues including the Company letting their Stock Exchange business go adrift, paying more attention to <b>floatation</b> of new companies and to banking operations in addition to their expenses boring them down. After the news of the firm failure had spread through the financial district, Hollin's attorney's Beekman, Menken & Griscom released a press statement downplaying the collapse: ...|$|E
