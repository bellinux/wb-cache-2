5|$|Aesthetically, {{the game}} used Fire Emblem {{elements}} as motifs, but took its setting and premise of {{a clash between}} worlds from Shin Megami Tensei. The battle system was originally going {{to be similar to}} a Fire Emblem game, but while it did incorporate elements such as the Weapon Triangle, it ultimately became a turn-based RPG battle system. After Atlus was made primary developer, the story was set in modern-day Tokyo and written around a group of young people facing challenges together. Its upbeat focus on character drama was a deliberate shift away from the dark scenarios of the Megami Tensei series. The game takes place in multiple locations around Tokyo, including Shibuya and Harajuku. The modern setting provided challenges for incorporating Fire Emblem characters, as characters in medieval armor just dropping into a modern setting would have looked strange. Among the considered possibilities were introducing Fire Emblem characters as human party members. In the end, it was decided to make them summoned helpers similar to the demons of Shin Megami Tensei, drawn <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> from their Idolosphere dimension.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed critical reviews, with [...] "Tweenlight" [...] generally being {{regarded as}} the best segment. John Griffiths of Us Weekly gave the episode three stars, writing that [...] "the three oddball tales run from mildly amusing to flat-out inspired. In one goofy vignette, Homer and a bikini-wearing Marge pluck a scary mystery man from the sea. However, watching Lisa crush on a brooding vampire in a dead-on poke at Twilight is the hilarious treat here." [...] Fred Topel of Screen Junkies wrote, [...] "The best jokes in all the segments are actually not the spoofs. They’re the cartoon physical comedy, the references to mundane frustrations like having to be the thimble when playing Monopoly. It’s also super gory. [...] I think “The Simpsons” {{are still on the}} creative upswing since The Simpsons Movie and this “Treehouse of Horrors” would hold up with classics like [...] "The Shinning" [...] and [...] "The Homega Man." [...] Brad Trechak of TV Squad felt {{that it was one of}} the best Treehouse of Horrors in years. He wrote, [...] "Of the three vignettes, the first segment 'War and Pieces,' while not the best, was the most original despite being a variation of the plot of 'Jumanji.' Unlike that book/movie, instead of the game coming <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> the game brings other board games <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> The satire on this show remains sharp as none of the games had the same name as their real world counterparts to prevent toy company litigation against Fox.

500|$|The side {{stories were}} created so the player could better {{understand}} and empathize with {{the struggles of}} entertainers in the industry and their private lives. Part of the team's struggle was balancing the main story and side missions, and making both appealing to players.

To counter this, [...] "Intermission" [...] periods were created where side story chapters could be accessed.

The general infusion of Japanese pop idol culture and the performing arts into the title was Atlus' take on traditions within Japanese Shamanism where the dancing of priestesses brought them closer to the gods they worshiped: in the game, it is through their performances that the main characters draw the attention of the Mirages and summon them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> Also working on the scenario was Aoi Akashiro, a writer whose resume included anime and video games.|$|E
