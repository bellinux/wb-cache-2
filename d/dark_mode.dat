40|$|Plasmonic <b>dark</b> <b>modes</b> {{are pure}} {{near-field}} modes that can {{arise from the}} plasmon hybridization {{in a set of}} interacting nanoparticles. When compared to bright <b>modes,</b> <b>dark</b> <b>modes</b> have longer lifetimes due to their lack of a net dipole moment, making them attractive for a number of applications. We demonstrate the excitation and optical detection of a collective <b>dark</b> plasmonic <b>mode</b> from individual plasmonic trimers. The trimers consist of triangular arrangements of gold nanorods, and due to this symmetry, the lowest-energy <b>dark</b> plasmonic <b>mode</b> can interact with radially polarized light. The experimental data presented confirm the excitation of this mode, and its assignment is supported with an electrostatic approximation wherein these <b>dark</b> <b>modes</b> are described in terms of plasmon hybridization. The strong confinement of energy in these modes and their associated near fields hold great promise for achieving strong coupling to single photon emitters...|$|R
40|$|Through a lattice {{dynamics}} analysis, it {{is revealed}} that the bubble plays a role of energy shield in the graphene, which helps to split the normal modes into two categories of distinct topological nature, namely the bright and <b>dark</b> <b>modes.</b> The topological invariants, Euler characteristic, of the bright and <b>dark</b> <b>modes</b> are 1 and 0, respectively. For bright modes, the energy is confined inside the bubble, so this type of modes {{are sensitive to the}} shape of the bubble; while opposite phenomenon is observed for the <b>dark</b> <b>modes.</b> The different behavior from these two types of normal modes is examined and verified in the process of phonon thermal transport. The bright and <b>dark</b> <b>modes</b> are expected to be distinguished in experiment with existing scanning force microscope techniques, and they should play significant roles in many other physical processes.

40|$|Lasing at the {{nanometre}} scale promises strong light-matter {{interactions and}} ultrafast operation. Plasmonic resonances supported by metallic nanoparticles have extremely small mode volumes and high field enhancements, making them an ideal platform for studying nanoscale lasing. At visible frequencies, however, {{the applicability of}} plasmon resonances is limited due to strong ohmic and radiative losses. Intriguingly, plasmonic nanoparticle arrays support non-radiative <b>dark</b> <b>modes</b> that offer longer life-times but are inaccessible to far-field radiation. Here, we show lasing both in <b>dark</b> and bright <b>modes</b> of an array of silver nanoparticles combined with optically pumped dye molecules. Linewidths of 0. 2 nanometers at visible wavelengths and room temperature are observed. Access to the <b>dark</b> <b>modes</b> is provided by a coherent out-coupling mechanism based on the finite size of the array. The results open a route to utilize all modes of plasmonic lattices, also the high-Q ones, for studies of strong light-matter interactions, condensation and photon fluids.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we report on}} the {{electromagnetic}} resonances excited in a planar metamaterial consisting of pairs of gold bars(dimers) arrayed on a dielectric substrate. In the case of equal bar lengths, bright resonance modes can be easily excited, which couple strongly to free space and posses a low Q-factor. The introduction of bar length asymmetry induces the excitation of the so-called <b>dark</b> <b>modes</b> which couple very weakly to free space and show high Q-factors. The interaction of the dark and bright resonant modes results in a Fano type profile of the resonance. With increasing length asymmetry, coupling of the <b>dark</b> <b>modes</b> to free space is increased, resulting in a lowered Q-factor. We discuss the dependence of both the <b>dark</b> and bright <b>modes</b> on the dimer geometry and refractive index of the metamaterial environment, in order to optimize the structure for a potential application as an optical sensor. Effective material parameters were obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry study of the metamaterial on a glass substrate and their physical meaning and applicability are discussed.

In addition to the small radiative damping and large field enhancement associated to <b>dark</b> <b>modes,</b> excitation with CVB can give place to unusual phenomenology like the formation of electromagnetic cold spots and the generation of Fano resonances in highly symmetric clusters.

In Radiant mode, level limitations are less strict, the player gets to recruit stronger heroes and hero XP gain is accelerated. The second mode is Stygian mode, which is a much more difficult and challenging mode. Stygian mode not only has enemies with increased health and damage and an increase in light depletion, but a failure condition. Should the player fail to complete the game within 86 in-game weeks or have 13 or more heroes killed, the 'Thing' will be awoken causing a game over and the save file to be deleted.

50|$|A {{thin coating}} of nanocrystals {{embedded}} in glass can provide selective control over both visible light and heat-producing near-infrared (NIR) light independently climates. The technology employs a small jolt of electricity to switch the material between NIR-transmitting and NIR-blocking states. Nanocrystals of {{indium tin oxide}} embedded in a glassy matrix of niobium oxide form a composite material. The voltage ranges over 2.5 volts. The same window can also be switched to a <b>dark</b> <b>mode,</b> blocking both light and heat, or to a bright, fully transparent mode. The effect relies on a synergistic interaction in the region where glassy matrix meets nanocrystal that increases the electrochromic effect. The atoms connect across the nanocrystal-glass interface, causing a structural rearrangement in the glass matrix. The interaction creates space inside the glass, allowing charge to move more readily.|$|E

30|$|The {{plasmonic}} breathing (PB) {{modes of}} a metal nanodisc are very special {{in the sense}} that they are radially symmetric and correlate with the intriguing collective radial oscillation of free electrons. Their appearance was first revealed in an electron energy loss spectroscopy study [10]. Their excitation by optical methods was considered to be difficult, because they are categorized as the <b>dark</b> <b>modes</b> owing to the null net electric dipole moment. Therefore, a recent experimental study [11] that showed that these modes can be excited under the oblique illumination of a linear polarized optical beam with the help of the retardation effect is notable. However, under this excitation approach, the PB modes are only weakly excited compared with the dominant plasmonic dipolar mode. Moreover, the other high-order plasmonic modes such as quadrupole and hexapole modes are also excited, which could overlay the PB modes. These situations were similarly encountered in the previous studies of optically excitation of the plasmonic <b>dark</b> <b>modes</b> based either on using the symmetry-breaking nanostructures or on employing the retardation effect [12, 13].|$|R
