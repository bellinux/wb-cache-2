5|$|In Mingora, the Taliban had set an edict that no <b>girls</b> <b>could</b> {{attend school}} after 15 January 2009. The group had already blown {{up more than}} a hundred girls' schools. The night before the ban took effect was filled with the noise of {{artillery}} fire, waking Yousafzai several times. The following day, Yousafzai also read for the first time excerpts from her blog that had been published in a local newspaper.|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The <b>girls</b> <b>could</b> speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E
5|$|St George's can admit up to 380 pupils annually. Upon admission, pupils are {{allocated}} a mixed ability form, {{where they}} are registered, taught Life Skills and have access to pastoral support from their tutors. For all the other lessons, the pupils are set by ability. Each year group has a progress manager with responsibility for the students in that year. Since the Education Act 2002, years 7, 8 and 9 have been grouped into Key Stage 3 and years 10 and 11 into Key Stage 4, which co-ordinates how the National Curriculum is taught. At St George's, a manager is assigned to each Key Stage for pastoral support. Before the conversion to Academy status, the school uniform consisted of a navy-blue blazer with the school emblem sewn on, a white shirt, navy-blue tie and dark-grey trousers (<b>girls</b> <b>could</b> wear plain-blue skirts) for all pupils in years 7–10; year 11 pupils could wear a dark-blue jumper, shirt and grey trousers. Since 2010, girls no longer wear ties, and must wear a revere collar blouse. Dark-grey trousers or a pleated dark-grey skirt are available for girls to wear; boys have dark-grey trousers. All pupils wear a blue blazer, but those in Key Stage 3 have bright blue piping on their lapels; shirts are white until Year 11, when thin blue stripes are worn.|$|E

25|$|Both {{boys and}} <b>girls</b> <b>could</b> {{experience}} sexual harassment although girls experienced it more frequently. Members {{of the school}} community sexually harassed girls in and around school. Jobless men, unmarried men looking for partners or sex, and married men looking for sex, sexually harassed girls {{on their way to}} and from school. In some cases, this could involve sexual assault and rape. Girls in the 10 to 19 year age group were most affected. Rape perpetrators could be diverse men in the community or men passing through the community. When rape occurred at home, perpetrators included uncles, cousins, fathers and stepfathers. <b>Girls</b> <b>could</b> be abducted for marriage which meant the man did not have to pay a bride price. Some compensation might be paid to the girl's parents so they would acknowledge the marriage. Parents could arrange an early or forced marriage against the girl's wishes to continue her education.|$|E
25|$|Lijjat {{expanded}} as {{a cooperative}} system. Initially, even younger <b>girls</b> <b>could</b> join, but later eighteen was fixed as the minimum age of entry. Within three months {{there were about}} 25 women making papads. Soon the women bought some equipment for the business, like utensils, cupboards, stoves, etc. In the first year, the organisation's annual sales were Rs. 6196. The broken papads were distributed among neighbours.|$|E

Finally, he played {{a leading role in the}} amalgamation of Banga Mahila Vidyalaya with Bethune School. By the time Monomohun Ghose died the institution had already turned, under his secretaryship, into a centre of higher studies where <b>girls</b> <b>could</b> read up to the postgraduate level.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the lawsuit, the adverse effects of {{radioactivity}} became widely known, and radium-dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear. In particular, dial painters no longer licked paint brushes to shape them (which caused some ingestion of radium salts). Radium was still used in dials as late as the 1960s, but there were no further injuries to dial painters. This highlighted that the harm to the Radium <b>Girls</b> <b>could</b> easily have been avoided.|$|E
25|$|In particular, {{they wanted}} to {{determine}} whether <b>girls</b> <b>could</b> be admitted at Oxford or Cambridge to sit the Senior and Junior Local Examinations. Davies and Bodichon set up a committee to that effect in 1862. In 1865, {{with the help of}} Henry Tomkinson, Trinity College alumnus and owner of an insurance company with good contacts within the University, 91 female students entered the Cambridge Local Examination. This first concession to women's educational rights met relatively little resistance, as admission to the examination did not imply residence of women at the university site.|$|E
25|$|Oakey {{states that}} {{when he found out}} the age of the girls and that they were best friends, he revised his plan for a single female and decided that the two <b>girls</b> <b>could</b> look after each other on the tour. Originally just wanting a single female singer to replace the high backing vocals {{originally}} provided by Martyn Ware, he says that he thought having two female vocalists/dancers would also add potential glamour to the band. Because of the girls' ages, Oakey and Wright later had to visit Sulley and Catherall's respective parents to obtain permission for the girls to go on the tour.|$|E

25|$|The most heated {{controversy}} {{was over}} {{the status of the}} Catholic Church. From a dominant position in 1788, it was almost destroyed in less than a decade, its priests and nuns turned out, its leaders dead or in exile, its property controlled by its enemies, and a strong effort underway to remove all influence of Christian religiosity, such as Sundays, holy days, saints, prayers, rituals and ceremonies. The movement to dechristianise France not only failed but aroused a furious reaction among the pious. Napoleon's Concordat was a compromise that restored some of the Catholic Church's traditional roles but not its power, its lands or its monasteries. Priests and bishops were given salaries as part of a department of government controlled by Paris, not Rome. Protestants and Jews gained equal rights. Battles over {{the role of religion in}} the public sphere, and closely related issues such as church-controlled schools, that were opened by the Revolution have never seen closure. They raged into the 20th century. By the 21st century, angry debates exploded over the presence of any Muslim religious symbols in schools, such as the headscarves for which Muslim <b>girls</b> <b>could</b> be expelled. J. Christopher Soper and Joel S. Fetzer explicitly link the conflict over religious symbols in public to the French Revolution, when the target was Catholic rituals and symbols.|$|E
500|$|The {{session was}} {{interrupted}} constantly, with people entering the building, phoning them, or throwing things through the window. Eventually, when the filming crew left the room, the group managed {{to finish the}} song. Stannards commented about the inspiration behind it to Music Week: [...] "We were talking about Bollywood films, the colours and how the Spice <b>Girls</b> <b>could</b> present themselves. It {{was a matter of}} how do we get everything in to one song?" [...] All the writing and the vocal recording was completed in one afternoon, and instead of taking turns, the five members went inside the vocal booths and recorded the chorus together. Brown commented that for this reason the final mix sounds [...] "spontaneous and full of energy".|$|E
500|$|Regarding Bell's {{influence}} on Anna, director Chris Buck said her personality {{was just so}} fun and energetic. [...] "We had an Anna character but Kristen really came in and pushed it and made it even funnier and even sweeter I think, and more believable as a three-dimensional character," [...] he said. He also admitted that he [...] "fell in love with 's voice and 's spirit". Director Jennifer Lee said that she loved Bell because the actress shared a similarity with her, that <b>girls</b> <b>could</b> be funny. [...] "So she was a fantastic collaborator," [...] Lee added. [...] Songwriting duo Kristen-Anderson Lopez and Robert Lopez later commented that they had written a lot of first songs for Kristen, for Anna but, [...] "The more we were working with Kristen Bell, the more, the more she influenced." [...] They quickly understand who Anna was because Anna's Kristen Bell.|$|E

500|$|Chastain began 2017 {{by serving}} as the {{executive}} producer and providing the narration for I Am Jane Doe, a documentary on sex trafficking. In an effort to work with more female filmmakers, Chastain starred in two projects directed by womenNiki Caro's The Zookeeper's Wife and Susanna White's Woman Walks Ahead. In the former, an adaptation of Diane Ackerman's non-fiction book of the same name, she co-starred with Johan Heldenbergh as the real-life Polish zookeepers Jan and Antonina Żabiński who saved many human and animal lives during World War II. The film received mixed reviews, although Stephen Holden took note of how Chastain's [...] "watchful, layered performance" [...] empowered the film. Woman Walks Ahead {{tells the story of}} the 19th-century activist Catherine Weldon, who served as an adviser to the Sioux chieftain Sitting Bull prior to the Wounded Knee Massacre. She was interested in portraying a role that young <b>girls</b> <b>could</b> look up to for inspiration, and provided off-screen inputs to avoid a white savior narrative.|$|E
500|$|Anne's {{father was}} soon {{appointed}} curate (deputy vicar) of Saint Wilfrid's, {{the local church}} in Alford, and in 1585 he also became the schoolmaster at the Alford Free Grammar School, one of many such public schools, free {{to the poor and}} begun by Queen Elizabeth. About this time, Marbury married his first wife Elizabeth Moore, who bore three children, then died. [...] Within a year of his first wife's death, Marbury married Bridget Dryden, about ten years younger than he and from a prominent Northampton family. [...] Bridget's brother Erasmus was the grandfather of John Dryden, the famous playwright and Poet Laureate. [...] Anne was the third of 15 children born to this marriage, 12 of whom survived early childhood. The Marburys lived in Alford for the first 15 years of Anne's life, and she received a better education than most girls of her time, with her father's strong commitment to learning, and she also became intimately familiar with scripture and Christian tenets. Education at that time was almost exclusively offered to boys and men. One possible reason why Marbury taught his daughters may have been that six of his first seven children were girls. Another reason may have been that the ruling class in Elizabethan England began realising that <b>girls</b> <b>could</b> be schooled, looking to the example of the queen, who spoke six foreign languages.|$|E
500|$|Portrayed by Yvonne Craig, the character's first {{adaptation}} {{outside of}} comic books {{took place in}} the third season of Batman (1967), Barbara Gordon having been discussed months earlier by her father and Batman in the second season episodes, [...] "Batman's Waterloo" [...] and [...] "The Duo Defy". Les Daniels, in Batman: The Complete History (2004) wrote that the goal of ABC was to [...] "attract new audience members, especially idealistic young girls and less high-minded older men." [...] According to Craig: [...] "I used to think the reason they hired me was because they knew I could ride my own motorcycle... I realized they hired me because I had a cartoon voice." [...] A shared criticism of Batgirl and other female superheroes in television that came later (such as Wonder Woman and the Bionic Woman), is that she was not allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat on screen. As such, [...] "her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a Broadway showgirl {{through the use of a}} straight kick to her opponent's face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use." [...] However, Craig has also stated: [...] "I meet young women who say Batgirl was their role model... They say it's because it was the first time they ever felt <b>girls</b> <b>could</b> do the same things guys could do, and sometimes better. I think that’s lovely." [...] During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women.|$|E
