60|$|They {{stood for}} a moment, their <b>hands</b> <b>locked.</b> It was a silent greeting, but their faces were eloquent. Brooks looked from his father to Lady Caroom and smiled.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few moments}} more she was {{kneeling}} with <b>hands</b> <b>locked</b> together before a much-gilded little waxem figure of St. Eustacie with his cross-bearing stag by his side, which stood in a curtained recess in the alcove where her stately bed was placed.|$|R
60|$|It {{felt good}} {{to get into the}} bright {{sunshine}} once more, and the boys tumbled up to the deck without ceremony. As soon as they had quitted the cabin the captain put away the weapons at <b>hand,</b> <b>locking</b> them in a closet.|$|R
60|$|They {{stood at}} the open window, close together, <b>hands</b> <b>locked,</b> gazing out over the quiet valley. The moon was full, and broad belts of silver light lay in strong {{contrast}} to black shadows. The hour was late. The sentries paced their beats.|$|R
60|$|The Texan paced {{to and fro}} {{beside the}} camp-fire with bent head, and <b>hands</b> <b>locked</b> behind him. But for the {{swinging}} gun he would have resembled a lanky farmer, coatless and hatless, with his brown vest open, his trousers stuck {{in the top of}} the high boots.|$|R
60|$|As to Ernest and Edie, {{when they}} got their own cheque for their quarter of the proceeds, they gazed in awe and astonishment at the bigness of the figure; and then they sat down and cried {{together}} like two children, with their <b>hands</b> <b>locked</b> in one another's.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not long}} before I made an attempt to {{liberate}} myself. The cell in which I was confined was built entirely of wood, and the door was not an extra heavy one. But with my <b>hands</b> <b>locked</b> together I was at a disadvantage. Yet terror lent me an artificial strength.|$|R
6000|$|She {{paused for}} a minute or two, with her <b>hand</b> <b>locked</b> in his. Then she said once more, very low, [...] "No, Guy didn't do it. But why did he run away? That baffles me quite. That's the one point of it all that makes it so strange and so terribly mysterious." ...|$|R
60|$|He leaned {{towards her}} now, {{supported}} by his elbow, {{so that his}} face was close to hers, a deeper flush upon it, a brighter glitter in his black eyes, his vinous breath enveloping and suffocating her. She shrank back, her <b>hands</b> <b>locking</b> themselves one in the other till the knuckles showed white.|$|R
60|$|She gave {{a little}} sobbing breath. Her <b>hands</b> were <b>locked</b> together.|$|R
60|$|They had {{sat down}} on the turf close to the ha-ha, and they were so near that Bernard was able to put out his hand with the view of taking that of his cousin within his own.

5000|$|It is also {{necessary}} to avoid unintentionally turning the handle during a hit at the ball so that the ball is [...] "sliced" [...] (to the right) or hooked (to the left), this is achieved by gripping the stick firmly, generally with one <b>hand</b> <b>locked</b> against the other {{at the top of}} the handle, at the moment of impact with the ball.|$|R
5000|$|The monofin swimmer extends arms forward, <b>locking</b> <b>hands</b> together, <b>locking</b> {{the head}} between the biceps. The undulating {{movement}} {{starts in the}} shoulders, with maximum amplitude towards the hips, the legs almost don't bend to transfer the movement to the monofin. This technique is called the dolphin kick.|$|R
60|$|But in {{the present}} {{instance}} there were eyes as bright as the <b>hand,</b> <b>locks</b> more glossy and luxuriant than Helen's of Troy, a cheek pink as a shell, and breaking into dimples like a May morning into sunshine, and lips from which stole forth a perfume sweeter than the whole conservatory. Ferdinand {{sat down on a}} chair opposite Miss Temple, with the extended skein.|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} of the bear hug is the inverted bear hug, where one wrestler has his <b>hands</b> <b>locked</b> behind his opponent's mid or lower back and presses his forehead into their sternum, while pulling his <b>locked</b> <b>hands</b> inwards towards himself; forcing his opponent to bend backwards and fall. It is a painful move as much pressure is being exerted onto the opponent's sternum, often hurting the back bones and muscles as well as forcing {{air out of the}} lungs. In professional wrestling, this move is most often used by wrestlers known for great upper body strength.|$|R
50|$|A {{pinch grip}} tie, or an over-under bodylock, is a clinch hold and {{stand-up}} grappling position {{that is an}} extension of the over-under position, but having both <b>hands</b> <b>locked</b> behind the opponents back. The <b>hands</b> are typically <b>locked</b> with a palm-to-palm grip, palm-to-wrist grip or fingers-to-fingers grip. The pinch grip tie can be used to throw the opponent, but usually the grapplers attempt to obtain a better hold such as double underhooks or double collar tie. The pinch grip tie is often a neutral position when both grapplers symmetrically have the same hold on each other.|$|R

"The brougham {{is at the}} door," [...] he said, with {{an anxious}} glance at Helen, who was leaning back against a chair, her <b>hands</b> <b>locked</b> in one another, ghastly pale, and evidently {{on the point of}} fainting. [...] "These men have only an open trap, and it is a cold drive across the moor. To-morrow you go to York to be brought before the magistrates. I shall be there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I do not, {{the most}} Merciful Father does," [...] said Dr. May. Flora {{sat for a}} minute or two, her <b>hands</b> <b>locked</b> {{together}} round her knees, her head bowed down, her lips compressed. Her father was so far satisfied that the bodily dangers he had dreaded were averted; but the agony of mind was far more terrible, especially in one who expressed so little, and in whom it seemed, as it were, pent up.|$|R

60|$|Coming {{down the}} steps a little {{sideways}} [Jacob sat on the window-seat talking to Durrant; he smoked, and Durrant looked at the map], the old man, with his <b>hands</b> <b>locked</b> behind him, his gown floating black, lurched, unsteadily, near the wall; then, upstairs he went into his room. Then another, who raised his hand and praised the columns, the gate, the sky; another, tripping and smug. Each went up a staircase; three lights were lit in the dark windows.|$|R

60|$|Archie {{submitted}} {{to wait for}} food and fuller information,--indeed {{the lady of the}} house manifested more impatience than he did, as she flitted about making preparations, and he sat with <b>hands</b> <b>locked</b> together over his knee, gazing fixedly at Julius, scarcely speaking, though eagerly listening; and when the meal was brought in, he could not eat, only eagerly drank off a cup of scalding tea, and watched Rosamond, as if jealous of any delay over her cutlet. She did not abuse his patience.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, nay, little child," [...] {{he whispered}} in her ear. [...] "Never weep {{for me that}} have not a tear for myself.

[...] For only answer she clung closer, her <b>hands</b> <b>locked</b> about his neck, her slender body shaken by her silent weeping. [...] "Don't pity me," [...] he besought her. [...] "I am content it should be so. It is the amend I promised you. Waste no pity on me, Ruth." ...|$|R
