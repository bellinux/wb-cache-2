5|$|After {{serving in}} the state senate, he became the {{youngest}} {{secretary of state in}} Oregon history after winning election in 1956 at age 34. Hatfield defeated fellow state senator Monroe Sweetland for the office, receiving 51.3% of the vote in the November general election. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> on January 7, 1957, and remained until he resigned on January 12, 1959.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{dodged the}} issue during the campaign, which he won in 1825, but once <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>office,</b> {{he had to}} come down on one side or the other. He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E

50|$|Within {{their proper}} sui iuris churches {{there is no}} {{difference}} between patriarchs and major archbishops. However, differences exist in the order of precedence (i.e. patriarchs take precedence over major archbishops) and in the mode of accession. Whereas the election of a major archbishop has to be confirmed by the pope before <b>he</b> may <b>take</b> <b>office,</b> no papal confirmation is needed for a newly elected patriarch before <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>office.</b> Rather, a newly-installed patriarch is required to petition the pope as soon as possible for the concession of what is called ecclesiastical communion.|$|R

He is not permitted to take another job in the private or public sector. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>office</b> before the President of the Superior University Council.|$|R
5|$|Daley {{received}} criticism when family, personal friends, {{and political}} allies seemed to disproportionately benefit from city contracting. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> {{in a city}} with regular annual budget surpluses and left the city with massive structural deficits. His budgets ran up the largest deficits in Chicago history. Prior to serving as mayor, Daley served in the Illinois Senate and then as the Cook County State's Attorney. Police use of force was an issue in Daley's tenures as state's attorney and mayor.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>office,</b> the FBI raided {{his office and}} homes for {{allegedly}} extorting money from small business owners in his district. Shortly after the raid, the city attorney began investigating Jew for violating residency requirements necessary to hold his supervisor position. In September 2007, he was suspended by Mayor Gavin Newsom and later resigned {{in the face of}} extortion and perjury charges. In late 2008, he pleaded guilty to both charges. He was sentenced to 64months in federal prison for extortion, and a year in county jail for perjury.|$|E
5|$|The 1999 presidential {{election}} {{was held on}} October 24. De la Rúa defeated Duhalde by 48.4% to 38.3%, well ahead of the threshold to avoid a ballotage election. Domingo Cavallo, Menem's former minister of economy, finished the race in third place. De la Rúa was inaugurated President of Argentina on December 10, 1999. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> with a favorability rating of 75%. Unlike Menem, whose initial cabinet was composed by trusted friends, De la Rúa's cabinet included five people with international degrees, and four economists.|$|E

5|$|Under the new constitution, {{the voters}} chose electors who then elected the {{governor}} {{and members of the}} Kentucky Senate. Though {{there is no indication that}} Shelby actively sought the office of governor, he was elected unanimously to that post by the electors on May 17, 1791. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> on June 4, 1792, the day the state was admitted to the Union. Though not actively partisan, he identified with the Democratic-Republicans. Much of his term was devoted to establishing basic laws, military divisions and a tax structure.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>office,</b> Bruce began {{investigating}} whether {{there would be}} interest in building a religious center and chapel complex at the school. After several years of negotiations with the various religious denominations which had operated on and off campus, Bruce engineered a consensus that the university would build a center based {{on the model of}} the Armed Forces Base Chapel. The new religious center would have a single chapel which would be shared by all of the groups, and office space for each group. The center opened in 1965 and was named for Bruce.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Arana, Árbenz contested the presidential {{elections}} that were held in 1950 and without significant opposition defeated Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, his nearest challenger, {{by a margin of}} over 50%. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> on March 15, 1951, and continued the social reform policies of his predecessor. These reforms included an expanded right to vote, the ability of workers to organize, legitimizing political parties, and allowing public debate. The centerpiece of his policy was an agrarian reform law under which uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1792 {{elections}} were {{held on the}} first Tuesday of October {{and members of the}} General Assembly <b>took</b> <b>office</b> on the first Tuesday of January. Also in 1792 the State Legislative Council was renamed the State Senate and the State House of Assembly became the State House of Representatives. The State President became the Governor and was popularly elected. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>office</b> the third Tuesday in January and had a three-year term.|$|R

5|$|As Lincoln's {{election}} became evident, secessionists {{made clear}} their intent {{to leave the}} Union before <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> the next March. On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed. Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America. The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal. The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February 9, 1861.|$|E
5|$|As soon as <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>office,</b> Meyszner {{embarked}} on a thorough re-organisation of all police operations in the occupied territory. He created four police area commands, aligned to the four military area commands, and ten police districts, corresponding to the military district commands. He took under his command {{the forces of the}} Serbian puppet government, known as the Serbian State Guard, and also established a number of auxiliary and volunteer police units across the whole territory. One of the units controlled by Meyszner was the Auxiliary Police Troop, recruited from Russian Volksdeutsche from the occupied territory but also from Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania and trained by the Orpo. It was planned to reach a strength of 400 men but little is known about its activities.|$|E
5|$|From 1996 to 2001, Jew was District 4 then-supervisor Leland Yee's {{volunteer}} community liaison. Jew first ran for Yee's District 4 seat in 2002 when Yee {{ran for the}} California State Assembly. Despite Yee's endorsement, Jew finished third, {{missing the}} runoff election. In 2006, Jew again ran for same supervisor seat when Fiona Ma ran for the California Assembly. Jew led other candidates including his top challenger Ron Dudum {{in the first round}} with 26% first-place votes. He eventually won the closely fought election after securing a 52% majority. In December 2006, Mayor Gavin Newsom appointed Jew to serve out the remainder of Ma's term; <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> in January 2007.|$|E

5|$|In January 1998, Marburger became {{president}} of Brookhaven Science Associates, which subsequently won a bid to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory for the federal government, and he became {{the director of the}} lab. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> after a highly publicized scandal in which tritium leaked from the lab's High Flux Beam Reactor, leading to calls by activists to shut down the lab. Rather than directly oppose the activists, Marburger created policies that improved the environmental management of the lab as well as community involvement and transparency. Marburger also presided over the commissioning of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, expanded the lab's program in medical imaging and neuroscience, and placed more emphasis on its technology transfer program.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870s, the {{municipal}} government in Buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt, with Democratic and Republican political machines cooperating {{to share the}} spoils of political office. In 1881 the Republicans nominated a slate of particularly disreputable machine politicians; the Democrats saw the opportunity to gain the votes of disaffected Republicans by nominating a more honest candidate. The party leaders approached Cleveland, and he agreed to run for Mayor of Buffalo, provided {{that the rest of}} the ticket was to his liking. When the more notorious politicians were left off the Democratic ticket, Cleveland accepted the nomination. Cleveland was elected mayor with 15,120 votes, as against 11,528 for Milton C. Beebe, his opponent. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> January 2, 1882.|$|E

In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket. He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> as President. In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.|$|E

5|$|Fortunately for Villiers, {{his case}} {{was not to}} be prosecuted with the utmost rigour. He was to some degree {{protected}} by the joint efforts of Boringdon's friends and the Whig George Tierney, as well as his own quick action in surrendering his property through writs of extent; and the delinquency of Joseph Hunt, Treasurer of the Ordnance attracted attention and saved Villiers from the full wrath of the finance committee. Their report on the matter noted that the writ of extent had been to the amount of £264,000, but only £91,000 had been raised from the sale of his property, and about £30,000 from securities and the bond posted for him when <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>office.</b> The committee recommended the abolition of the office of Paymaster of Marines and the transfer of its duties to the Treasurer of the Navy, a recommendation which was not immediately acted upon. Villiers was left, in Boringdon's estimation, with a debt of £1,500–2,000, an annual income of £2,000–3,000, and the property in Cranbourne Lodge.|$|E
5|$|Hannah's planned three-year term as Chief of the Air Staff was {{cut short}} by some ten months when he {{accepted}} an offer to serve as Governor of Queensland, becoming the first officer in the RAAF to receive a vice-regal appointment. The announcement was made in January 1972, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> on 21March. He succeeded Sir Alan Mansfield. Hannah {{did not have a}} strong connection with Queensland {{at the time of his}} appointment, and had only lived in the state during his period as commander of RAAF Station Amberley between 1949 and 1951. He claimed not to have actively sought the governorship, and was criticised for failing to consult with senior colleagues before making his decision to retire early from his position as head of the Air Force. He was replaced as CAS by his deputy, Air Vice Marshal (later Air Marshal Sir) Charles Read.|$|E
5|$|In 1723, Bach was {{appointed}} as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig, {{where he was}} responsible for the music at four churches and for the training and education of boys singing in the Thomanerchor. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>office</b> {{in the middle of the}} liturgical year, on the first Sunday after Trinity. In his first twelve months in office, Bach decided to compose new works for almost all liturgical events, known as his first cantata cycle. The year after, he continued that effort, composing chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. He kept the format of the chorale cantata cycle until Palm Sunday of 1725, but then repeated an early Easter cantata, Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4, on Easter Sunday, and wrote Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden for Easter Monday as the first cantata in that cycle that was not a chorale cantata. The change was possibly due to the loss of a librettist.|$|E
