500|$|After {{taking a}} year off, Gil Cates was {{selected}} by AMPAS in November 1996 to oversee production of the ceremony for the seventh time. Immediately, he chose actor and comedian Billy Crystal to host the 1997 telecast, stating, [...] "Billy is quick and agile and bright, and he plays the unexpected events of the live telecast like a Stradivarius. He's become the standard against which all other hosting performances are measured." [...] Crystal expressed his excitement on hosting the ceremony {{for the fifth time}} joking, [...] "Once Barry Scheck turned it down, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> they'd come to me." [...] Furthermore he set up a website with the address www.whyistheshowsolong.com asking the public to send in jokes that would eventually be used during the gala.|$|E
500|$|I {{can only}} {{remember}} {{bits and pieces}} of the game. I was psyched. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of euphoria. I was zeroed in on the [...] glove, but I didn't hit the glove too much. I remember hitting a couple of batters, and the bases were loaded two or three times. The ball was small sometimes, the ball was large sometimes, sometimes I saw the catcher, sometimes I didn't. Sometimes, I tried to stare the hitter down and throw while I was looking at him. I chewed my gum until it turned to powder. I started having a crazy idea in the fourth inning that Richard Nixon was the home plate umpire, and once I thought I was pitching a baseball to Jimi Hendrix, who to me was holding a guitar and swinging it over the plate. They say I had about three to four fielding chances. I remember diving {{out of the way of}} a ball I thought was a line drive. I jumped, but the ball wasn't hit hard and never reached me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You were saying, lady, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> for the {{weakness}} and helplessness of our sex, and surely you did me justice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Kernan. [...] "That's why <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> for them. It's some {{of those}} secular priests, ignorant, bumptious----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This parcel, if you will. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that I'd {{rather not}} have it knock about in a mail-bag," [...] and the Doctor told him why.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] he answered. [...] "That is, personally, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that he should. But {{that has}} nothing to do with the legal aspects of the case." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that this}} wasn't in the contract, but there wasn't {{anything}} to be done. It seemed brutal to leave the poor chap alone with the woman, so I went along.|$|E
6000|$|... "Him? It, you mean. I was watching. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling,</b> but I wasn't sure. At least, I wasn't sure before. But {{this evening}} I was certain." [...] Klaus rubbed his pistol butt nervously. [...] "We're lucky. Don't you understand? Another hour and it might--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "an impulse. I {{can call}} it by no other name. I should have taken a train that leaves New York at noon; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> this morning, which seemed almost like a presentiment, that I might be of some use to you." ...|$|E
3000|$|... “The {{students}} made progress. They asked {{questions on the}} topics {{that they did not}} understand. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that they want to understand more about this subject [Optics].” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I shall go with you,' she answered, 'for, except you, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{no one in}} the world, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that if we set out {{together}} we shall be lucky.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was looking}} through them--certainly not at them. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of being moved about like a puppet {{in the hands}} of a person who legally can be nothing to me.' ...|$|R
60|$|And then I got {{a sample}} of Mulligan Jacobs. The venom of hatred I had already seen in his face was as nothing {{compared}} with what now was manifested. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that, like stroking a cat in cold weather, did I touch his face it would crackle electric sparks.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling,</b> {{the feeling}} {{for a moment}} that, {{notwithstanding}} the crowded room and Louis' attitude of polite attention, my life was in danger. There flashed something in his eyes indescribably venomous. I seemed to see there his intense and passionate desire to sweep me {{from the face of}} the earth.|$|E
6000|$|... "What! are you drawing {{it all out}} again?" [...] {{he asked}} in surprise. Then I {{realized}} that I had written fifty-six instead of six. I was too far gone to reason now. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that it was impossible}} to explain the thing. All the clerks had stopped writing to look at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll wait," [...] thought Mr. Quack, [...] "until that thing, {{whatever}} it is, {{comes out of}} those Black Shadows into the moonlight. Somehow <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that we are in}} no danger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nicholas, you {{say that}} you are doubtful. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that before long the King will {{announce}} his intention of marrying Sara Van Decht. Will you remain even then his faithful servant?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Spooky chuckled. [...] "I've got {{an empty}} stomach myself, Peter," [...] said he, [...] "but it isn't making me unhappy. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that somewhere there is a fat Mouse waiting for me." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the height}} of the gusts, in my high position, where the seas did not break, I found myself {{compelled}} to cling tightly to the rail to escape being blown away. My face was stung to severe pain by the high-driving spindrift, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that the wind was blowing the cobwebs out of my sleep-starved brain.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that, through them, he {{was trying}} to force remembrance of himself upon me. The man himself--the very soul of him--seemed to be {{concentrated}} in them. Something formless and yet distinct was visualising itself before me. It came to me as a physical relief when a spasm of pain caused him to turn his eyes away from me.|$|E
60|$|Above {{all other}} considerations, however, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling,</b> {{perhaps it was}} a mistaken one,--that my powers grew in {{proportion}} as I went Eastward. In West Salem I was merely an amateur gardener, living a life which approached the vegetable,--so far as external action went. In Chicago I was a perversity, a man of mis-directed energy. In New York I was, at least respected as a writer.|$|E
6000|$|... "He has indeed, Pathfinder; and, though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been {{loath to}} believe {{anything}} to the injury of Jasper, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> which tells me I ought to distrust him. Do you believe in presentiments, my friend? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{tried to}} do the work as well as I could, sir," [...] I replied. [...] "But I don't like the grocery business, or any other business. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that I'm not made for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Do {{what you}} like {{as long as you}} keep her out. You two {{together}} would be too much for me to-night. Why don’t you go and lock those doors? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> she is on the prowl.” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that he {{understood}} me, not intellectually, but emotionally. What a companion he might have been!... Moreton and Biddy moved me less. They were more robust, more normal, less introspective and imaginative; Europe meant nothing to them, but they were frankly delighted and excited {{at the prospect of}} going on the ocean, asking dozens of questions about the great ship, impatient to embark.....|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} imagine, at the time, what was ailing me, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of some {{impending}} and deadly illness. My nerves were all awry, and, from the astounding tricks they played me, my senses {{seemed to have}} run riot. Strange sounds disturbed me. At times I heard the swish-swish of grass being shoved aside, and once the patter of feet across a patch of stony ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] said Adam; [...] "you're not accountable. Looks as if {{the other}} fellow was too smart for both of us; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> I'd better stick to tinto and siphon. You can {{generally}} taste anything suspicious in that mixture and I've been doped before. But, as I'm an American citizen and American influence is powerful, I didn't expect they'd be bold enough to get after me." ...|$|E
6000|$|As the day wore on I said to him, [...] "It {{seems like}} Sunday to me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that mother and Zulime are away at church {{and that they}} may, at any moment, come in together." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{for those}} ships, [...] Each worn and ancient one, With great bluff bows, and broad in the beam: [...] Ay, it was unkindly done. [...] But so they serve the Obsolete-- [...] Even so, Stone Fleet! ...|$|R
5000|$|Caine stated, [...] "The first Sleuth I {{thought was}} great {{and the second}} Sleuth I thought was great until I read the reviews. I said to Pinter, 'What film did they show them?' <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that new Sleuth will be rediscovered some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{something}} {{just a little}} cruel {{in the way the}} painter looked at her, then seeming to feel compunction, he said quickly: [...] "I always hated--the peasant life--I wanted to get away into the world; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> in here--I wanted--I don't know what I wanted! I did run away at last to a house-painter at Meran. The priest wrote me a letter from my father--they threw me off; that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hopkins it was. I did {{not like}} telling him, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that in some way}} it was against the rules to tell him, but I did. He was walking part of the way home with me; he was talkative, and if we had not talked about the enchanted garden we should have talked of {{something}} else, and it was intolerable to me to think about any other subject. So I blabbed.|$|E
60|$|The morning {{came and}} went, but my wish and {{intention}} still remained; {{and so in}} the full tide of noon, with the sun in all its fiery force, I {{set out for the}} old church of St. Sava. I carried with me a lantern with powerful lens. I had wrapped it up secretly, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that I should not like anyone to know that I had such a thing with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Inductive reasoning, I admit, {{seems to}} have fallen down to a certain extent," [...] said Ashe. [...] "We must wait for the coincidence. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that it will come." [...] He paused. [...] "I am very {{fortunate}} {{in the way of}} coincidences." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's as they please. I don't {{think they}} will very often. I would not for the world put you against Uncle Thomas, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that <b>I</b> shall never get on with him. But you will never {{separate}} yourself from me, Ayala!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not sure," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{feel that}} I must, and yet, in a sense, I {{do not like}} to go. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that they do not mean to let me out of Berlin again. They think that I know too much." ...|$|R
