5|$|The first Jackie Robinson Day was on April 15, 2004. That {{day was a}} {{start to}} an annual {{tradition}} throughout Major League Baseball and an inspirational reminder about what happened on that day exactly fifty-seven years earlier when Jackie Robinson became a Major League Baseball player. The <b>day</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the first official league-wide Jackie Robinson Day, having festivities taking place at all 23 ballparks where Major League games were scheduled to be played. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig made the announcement with Sharon Robinson (daughter of Rachel and Jackie Robinson).|$|E
5|$|As August ended, {{production}} {{continued to}} slip farther behind schedule. Koenig learned {{that rather than}} being released in 14 days after his scenes were completed, his last <b>day</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on October 26—eight weeks later than expected. The next bridge scenes to be filmed after the wormhole sequence, Enterprises approach to V'Ger and the machine's resulting attack, were postponed for two weeks so that the special effects for the scene could be planned and implemented, and the engine room scenes could be shot. Chekov's burns sustained in V'Ger's attack were difficult to film; though the incident took only minutes on film, Weldon spent hours preparing the effect. A piece of aluminum foil was placed around Koenig's arm, covered by a protective pad and then hidden by the uniform sleeve. Weldon prepared an ammonia and acetic acid solution that was touched to Koenig's sleeve, causing it to smoke. Difficulties resulted in the scene being shot ten times; it was especially uncomfortable for the actor, whose arm was slightly burned {{when some of the}} solution leaked through to his arm.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool manager Joe Fagan bought Walsh for a £700,000 fee in May 1984. Walsh {{turned down}} an {{approach}} from Italian Serie A side Calcio Como to join Liverpool. He joined Liverpool in time to travel with the players to Rome to see them win the 1984 European Cup Final. He made his debut as a substitute on 18 August 1984 in the 1–0 Charity Shield defeat to derby rivals Everton. With Ian Rush injured {{at the start of}} the 1984–85 season, Walsh partnered Kenny Dalglish up front, and he scored just 14 minutes into his Anfield debut on 27 August in a 3–0 win over West Ham United. However, he picked up a knee injury in October which caused him to miss six weeks and allowed Rush to re-establish himself as Dalglish's preferred strike partner. He scored 13 goals in 39 appearances in all competitions throughout the 1984–85 campaign, the most significant goal being the equaliser in the last minute of extra-time against rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals at Goodison Park. However Liverpool would lose the replay, and also finished as runners-up in the league and European Cup. Walsh started the 1985 European Cup Final against Juventus at Heysell Stadium, but had to come off early in the second half after aggravating a stomach injury; Liverpool lost the game 1–0, though the <b>day</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> remembered for the disaster which cost 39 lives.|$|E

5|$|One day at Emain Macha, Cú Chulainn overhears Cathbad {{teaching}} his pupils. One {{asks him}} what that day is auspicious for, and Cathbad replies that any warrior who takes arms that day will have everlasting fame. Cú Chulainn, though only seven years old, goes to Conchobar {{and asks for}} arms. None of the weapons given to him withstand his strength, until Conchobar gives him his own weapons. But when Cathbad sees this he grieves, because he had not finished his prophecy—the warrior who took arms that <b>day</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> famous, but his life would be short. Soon afterwards, {{in response to a}} similar prophecy by Cathbad, Cú Chulainn demands a chariot from Conchobar, and only the king's own chariot withstands him. He sets off on a foray and kills the three sons of Nechtan Scéne, who had boasted they had killed more Ulstermen than there were Ulstermen still living. He returns to Emain Macha in his battle frenzy, and the Ulstermen are afraid he will slaughter them all. Conchobar's wife Mugain leads out the women of Emain, and they bare their breasts to him. He averts his eyes, and the Ulstermen wrestle him into a barrel of cold water, which explodes from the heat of his body. They put him in a second barrel, which boils, and a third, which warms to a pleasant temperature.|$|E

25|$|Although the Telluride mill had {{increase}} wages on 1 May, on 5 July {{the company}} {{announced that it was}} cutting back part of the increase.

25|$|At an {{emergency}} city council meeting later that night, Andrews warned workers {{who did not}} show up for work the next <b>day</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fired.

25|$|A {{story of}} the {{founding}} of the city goes as follows: Seleucus asked the Babylonian priests which <b>day</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> best to found the city. The priest calculated the day, but, wanting the founding to fail, told Seleucus a different date. The plot failed however, because when the correct day came, Seleucus' soldiers spontaneously started to build the city. When questioned, the priests admitted their deed.|$|E
25|$|In this segment, Dick and Dom {{would go}} to a town wearing entirely white clothes. Their task was to get as dirty as {{possible}} during the day.

The presenter who was the dirtiest {{at the end of the}} <b>day</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> declared the winner.|$|E

25|$|The USAF {{proposed}} a three-day bombing campaign against communist sanctuaries {{on the eastern}} Plain of Jars. It was posited that the enemy would withdraw back to protect their bases, thus relieving {{the pressure on the}} Hmong. A request for 80 sorties per day was lodged with the air force. Sixty sorties per <b>day</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> allocated to direction by Raven Forward Air Controllers; twenty would strike the enemy lines of communication, Route 7. Approval came for 65 missions daily. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma lifted most bombing restrictions on the Plain of Jars.|$|E
25|$|Thanks-Giving Square was {{originally}} planned {{as the first}} of several traffic-relieving complexes in downtown Dallas. The Bullington Truck Terminal, one of the key features in the Ponte-Travers-designed plan for downtown circulation, was constructed to consolidate street-level delivery trucks following Dallas' rapid growth in the 1960s. By placing truck traffic below-grade, it was estimated that 350 trucks per <b>day</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> removed from ground-level streets. The city issued $6.5 million for the project as part of the 1972 city bond program; construction was finished in 1977.|$|E
25|$|The Fasli {{proposal}} had two useful features: a leap-day {{once every}} four years, and {{harmony with the}} tropical year. The leap-day, called Avardad-sal-Gah (or in Pahlavi: Ruzevahizak), would be inserted, when required, after the five existing Gatha days {{at the end of}} the year. New Year's <b>Day</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> kept on the northward vernal equinox, and if the leap-day was applied correctly, would not drift away from the spring. The Fasli society also claimed that their calendar was an accurate religious calendar, as opposed to the other two calendars, which they asserted were only political.|$|E

25|$|People rely on compulsions as {{an escape}} from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the {{intrusive}} thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on {{the context in which}} the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a <b>day</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 the Bahá’í {{community}} {{approached the}} Race Relations Conciliator with {{a project to}} honor the memory of Hedi Moani, an Iranian-born Bahá'í who worked to promote positive race relations. Discussions took place over many months and on 10 December 1998 (Human Rights Day), the Race Relations Office formally announced that Race Unity <b>Day</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> celebrated in New Zealand on 21 March each year. The first awards were in 2001. There are reviews of speeches in 2007, 2008, and 2009. National covereage of events with the police was affirmed in 2008. In addition to national-scale events various localities have had local competitions - an example was the observance in Whangarei and Lower Hutt in 2009. In 2012 then 13 year old Rima Shenoy submitted a video that won {{first place in the}} Race Unity Speech Awards of the New Zealand Police and the Bahá'ís.|$|E

50|$|The {{more precise}} {{method is to}} add or {{subtract}} half {{the number of days}} in a year to the birth date. In the case of a common year, this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> 182.5 <b>days.</b> In leap years, the number of <b>days</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> 183. This method would lead to a March 1 or February 29 half-birthday for an August 30 birthday, depending on whether it's a leap year.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, the Federal Government of Somalia {{announced}} that national memorial <b>days</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> held in Mogadishu in Hussein's honour, {{with the late}} leader's body slated to be transported to the city for burial.
