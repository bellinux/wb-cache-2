Special signal control strategies have been developed in the past for diamond interchanges to address the unique traffic flow and geometric characteristics such as tight spacing and one-way cross streets. This paper documents the application of diamond <b>interchange</b> signal <b>control</b> strategies on a site consisting of six closely-spaced intersections in Reno, Nevada. These intersections represent or closely resemble a standard diamond <b>interchange.</b> Advanced <b>control</b> strategies are derived based on diamond <b>interchange</b> signal <b>control</b> schemes. Simulation results of the timing strategies indicate significant reductions of the number of stops; however, no significant change is found for the overall travel time and delays for the study site. Because the proposed control strategies emphasize maximum progression between closely spaced paired signals, the external approaches normally experience increased delays and stops. The proposed control is considered more efficient than the existing control due to significant reduction of stops and much improved driving experience and driver’s expectations. Public reaction to the new timings has been positive. Similar applications could be easily adopted at other locations of similar site characteristics.

The selection of control for a diamond interchange is based upon many factors, including the geometry of the interchange, the current traffic patterns, and expected traffic patterns. Each possible control plan for an interchange is more applicable in certain situations, and no plan is best for all situations. Strategies, or goals, can be developed based upon the situation which assist in selecting the most appropriate control plan.

40|$|O cálculo da capacidade de transferência de potência em sistemas interligados é calculado considerando o sistema como uma única área e uma única barra de folga. A máxima potência ativa que poderia ser transferida pelas linhas de intercâmbio, sem problemas relacionados com a estabilidade estática de tensão, é obtida efetuando-se a soma dos correspondentes fluxos nas linhas de intercâmbio no ponto de operação correspondente a máxima potência ativa. Cabe ressaltar que neste caso, o sistema de equações não inclui as equações do controle de intercâmbio entre áreas (CIA). Neste trabalho propõe-se a inclusão do CIA no fluxo de carga continuado de forma a possibilitar com isso a obtenção da capacidade de transferência de potência entre as diversas áreas, considerando múltiplas barras folga por área. Cada área atua como um sistema independente controlando seu intercâmbio no processo de carregamento do sistema. O objetivo é o de mostrar os efeitos resultantes desta inclusão sobre a capacidade de transferência de potência dentro de uma mesma área ou entre as diversas áreas.

The {{calculation}} of power transfer capability of interconnected systems is calculated considering {{the system as}} a single area and a single bus slack. The maximum power active that could be transferred through the tie lines, without the problems related with the static voltage stability is obtained by making the sum of the corresponding flows the tie lines in operation point corresponding the maximum power active. In this case, the system of equations does not include equations of area <b>interchange</b> <b>control</b> (AIC). This work proposes the inclusion of AIC in continuation power flow, with this is possible to obtain the power transfer capacity between different areas, and multiple slacks buses per area. Each area acts as an independent system controlling its exchange in the process of loading system. The objective is to show the effects of this inclusion on power transfer capability within the same area or between different areas. Using the proposed continuation power flow, shows the results obtained in the IEEE 9 buses, New England 30 buses and IEEE 118 buses systems, which were divided in areas with the objective of evidencing the differences between the margins of loading and transfer power obtained with and without the restrictions imposed by the AIC.
