40|$|The GERDA (GERmanium Detector Array) is an {{experiment}} for {{the search of}} neutrinoless double beta decay (0 νββ) in 76 Ge, located at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso of INFN (Italy). GERDA operates bare high purity germanium detectors submersed in liquid Argon (LAr). Phase II of data-taking started in Dec 2015 and is currently ongoing. In Phase II 35 kg of germanium detectors enriched in 76 Ge including thirty newly produced Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detectors is operating to reach an exposure of 100 kg·yr within about 3 years data taking. The <b>design</b> <b>goal</b> of Phase <b>II</b> {{is to reduce the}} background by one order of magnitude to get the sensitivity for ν 02 / 1 T = O(1026) yr. To achieve the necessary background reduction, the setup was complemented with LAr veto. Analysis of the background spectrum of Phase II demonstrates consistency with the background models. Furthermore 226 Ra and 232 Th contamination levels consistent with screening results. In the first Phase II data release we found no hint for a 0 νββ decay signal and place a limit of this process ν 02 / 1 T> 5. 3 · 1025 yr (90 % C. L., sensitivity 4. 0 · 1025 yr). First results of GERDA Phase II will be presented. JRC. G. 2 -Standards for Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguard...|$|R

40|$|Aspect-oriented {{languages}} {{provide a}} lot of flexibility for soft-ware modularization. On one hand it is an advantage, be-cause when choosing from more alternatives we can find de-signs that better meet our needs. On another hand {{there is also a}} greater risk to misuse this flexibility and to pro-duce too complicated designs. In this paper we show that there can be different solutions to the same problem de-pending on the assumed <b>design</b> <b>goals.</b> Thus, we shouldn’t speak about the best design, but rather about the best de-sign with respect to the stated design goals; and the success of design largely depends on proper selection of <b>design</b> <b>goals.</b> We believe that the design process could be improved by making goal analysis more explicit. Non-functional require-ments should be specialized up to specific <b>design</b> <b>goals</b> that constrain implementation decisions. These goals should be documented and used for understanding and evaluating de-signs. Furthermore, design patterns should assist developers in the goal-driven design process by providing a catalogue of <b>design</b> <b>goals</b> that should be considered {{in the context of the}} design pattern and a guide on how these <b>design</b> <b>goals</b> could be translated into implementation decisions. 1...|$|R

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} hard real-time systems requirements on mi-croprocessor performance. Certain dependability aspects are alse considered although not covered in detail. Therefore we discuss hard real-time systems and micropro-cessors from an architectural point of view as well as system hardware design. The architectural considerations assume an event triggered hard real-time system with ker-nel software. The hardware considerations treat a space qualied computer system compared to a general purpose application. Hard real-time systems are intended for use in environments where dependability is a primary <b>design</b> <b>goal.</b> For the majority of commonmicroprocessors, high performance has been the primary <b>design</b> <b>goal.</b> However, a primary <b>design</b> <b>goal</b> such as high per-formance introduces con icts with a <b>design</b> <b>goal</b> such as dependability.
