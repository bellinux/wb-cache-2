2500|$|Written by Bonnie Bramlett and Leon Russell, [...] "Superstar" [...] {{had been}} made popular by Rita Coolidge in 1970, but the Carpenters' version, {{released}} as a single in August 1971, became an international hit. In the liner notes for , Richard writes that he saw Bette Midler singing the song on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and felt {{that it would be}} a perfect fit for Karen's voice. Richard did have reservations about the lyrics, however, which he found a little too suggestive. After changing [...] "I can <b>hardly</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> sleep with you again" [...] to [...] "I can <b>hardly</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> be with you again," [...] he recorded Karen singing the song, reading the revised lyrics from a napkin. What wound up on the finished recording was the first time Karen had ever sung [...] "Superstar". After only the first take, Richard claimed that her performance was [...] "perfect" [...] as it was, and did not need repeating.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was born}} Rose August Wenger in Cleveland, Ohio, {{one of five}} girls to Swiss-German parents, Fred and Annie Wegner. [...] Her father had wanted a son, and {{encouraged}} {{her to be a}} tomboy. Helen saw her first Wild West show in Cleveland in the summer of 1909 and answered a Miller Brothers 101 Ranch ad for girl riders in Billboard magazine. They taught her to ride, and she performed in her first 101 Ranch Real Wild West Show in St. Louis in April 1910. [...] Said Helen: [...] "(I) was already practicing picking up a handkerchief from the ground at full gallop. When veteran riders told me I could get kicked in the head, I paid no heed. Such things might happen to others, but could never happen to me, I believed. We barnstormed all over the US and the season ended all too soon. I was sorry when I had to go home, and could <b>hardly</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> open in Boston in the spring of 1911." ...|$|E

Here, then, was the fruit of the Conquest, here was the elimination of work, the end of hunger and of cold, the cessation of the hard struggle, the downfall of change and death--nay, the very millennium of happiness. And yet, somehow, there seemed something wrong with it all. I pondered, then I put two or three rapid questions, <b>hardly</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> reflect upon the answers.|$|R
2500|$|... "Superstar", {{written by}} Bonnie Bramlett and Leon Russell, became the duo's next hit. The song had {{originally}} appeared on Joe Cocker's 1970 album Mad Dogs & Englishmen, sung by Rita Coolidge. Karen {{was familiar with}} the album, but Richard first heard the song when it was covered by Bette Midler on The Tonight Show, and realised its potential as a Carpenters hit. The duo changed the line [...] "I can <b>hardly</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> sleep with you again" [...] to [...] "... to be with you again", as they knew the former would not be played on Top 40 radio. The single sold a million copies, attaining gold status, and became the Carpenters' third No.2 single on the Billboard Hot 100 (this time held off the top spot by Rod Stewart's [...] "Maggie May" [...] / [...] "Reason to Believe"). On May 14, 1971, the Carpenters performed a sell-out show at Carnegie Hall, and they released their third album, Carpenters the same day. It became one of their best sellers, earning RIAA certification for platinum four times, and rising to No. 2 on Billboards pop album chart for two weeks (behind Carole King's Tapestry) with over a million pre-sales orders. The album won a Grammy Award, as well as receiving three nominations. Shortly after this, the duo recorded a short television series, Make Your Own Kind of Music, which drew mixed reviews.|$|E

Pipe up, Ed, {{this is too}} good to end without one song more," [...] cried Mr. Burton, who had been singing like a trumpet; and, <b>hardly</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> get their breath, off they all went again with the {{national}} hymn, singing as they never had sung it before, for somehow the little scenes they had just acted or beheld seemed to show how much this dear America of ours had cost {{in more than one}} revolution, how full of courage, energy, and virtue it was in spite of all its faults, and what a privilege, as well as duty, it was for each to do his part toward its safety and its honor in the present, as did those brave {{men and women in the}} past.|$|R

If she could only know, while she was saying the fatal words to Horace, that Julian was listening too, she would be encouraged to meet the worst that could happen! As the idea crossed her mind, she observed that Julian was looking toward the door through which they had lately passed.

'It's {{the way of}} the world, sir,' said Tregarva, 'judging carnal judgment, {{according}} to the sight of its own eyes; always looking at the outsides of things and men, sir, and never much deeper.

Among this happy band stood our Jimmy, chosen for his good voice, and Will, because of her bright face and lively, self-possessed manners. They could <b>hardly</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> be dismissed, and it was a race home to see who should be first to tell the good news.

He was afraid she would ask him what his initiation had cost; but she seemed to have no idea that it had cost anything, and though it had swept away a third of the money he had received for his sketch, he still resolved that she should have that supper at Parker's.|$|E
