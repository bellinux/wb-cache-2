2500|$|In finance, a {{convertible}} bond or [...] convertible note or convertible debt (or {{a convertible}} debenture {{if it has}} a maturity of greater than 10 years) is a type of bond that the holder can convert into a specified number of shares of common stock in the issuing company or cash of equal value. [...] It is a hybrid security with debt- and equity-like features. It originated in the mid-19th century, and was used by early speculators such as Jacob Little and Daniel Drew to counter market cornering. [...] Convertible bonds are most often issued by companies with a low credit rating and high growth potential.

40|$|In this paper, we analyze data on trends since 2000 {{in foreign}} {{holdings}} of government <b>securities</b> and other <b>debt</b> <b>securities,</b> {{with emphasis on}} Japan and developing Asia. We find that foreign residents generally increased their holdings of Asian <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> during the sample period and in particular during the post-global financial crisis (GFC) period. Meanwhile, foreign holdings of <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> have been declining in the eurozone. Foreign holdings of short-term <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> were very volatile during the GFC period (20092 ̆ 01311), with {{a sharp drop in}} foreign holdings of short-term Asian <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> that was followed by a renewed surge.

The overall increase in foreign holdings of Asian <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> appears to be driven by relatively stable exchange rates and the higher risk-adjusted returns on the <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> of the region.

40|$|Enhancements to the BIS <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> {{statistics}} 1 The BIS has revised its <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> {{statistics to}} enhance their comparability across different markets. International issues have been redefined as <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> issued outside the market where the borrower resides, and statistics combining international and domestic issues are being released for the first time. The revised statistics highlight the growing size and internationalisation of bond markets. JEL classification: F 34, G 15. The internationalisation of bond markets has made {{it increasingly difficult to}} distinguish between international and domestic <b>debt</b> <b>securities.</b> The BIS has thus revised its methodology for classifying international issues, focusing now on the market of issue instead of the targeted investor base. In addition, the BIS has harmonised classifications with those in the Handbook on Securities Statistics and released for the first time data on total <b>debt</b> <b>securities.</b> This special feature outlines the reasons for these changes and discusses their impact on the statistics. Conceptual challenges The BIS has since the mid- 1980 s published statistics on borrowing activity in debt capital markets. Coverage has improved steadily over the years, expanding from the initial focus on international markets to cover more than 50 domestic markets as well. At the same time, changes in financial markets have challenged the usefulness of the statistics for financial stability analysis. 2 In particular, the growing size and diversity of <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> markets have heightened the importance of comparable data across markets. Furthermore, the growing openness of local markets to foreign investors and issuers has blurred the distinction between international and domestic <b>debt</b> <b>securities...</b>|$|R
