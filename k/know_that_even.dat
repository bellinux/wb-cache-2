25|$|The chief {{reason why}} people with {{diabetes}} develop high blood pressure is hardening of the arteries. Diabetes tends {{to speed up the}} process of atherosclerosis. The other fact about diabetes is that it affects both large and small blood vessels in the body. Over time, blood vessels become clogged with fatty depots, become non-compliant and lose their elasticity. The process of atherosclerosis is a lot faster in diabetic individuals whom do not have good control of their blood sugars. The high blood pressure eventually leads to heart failure, strokes, heart attacks, blindness, kidney failure, loss of libido and poor circulation of blood in the legs. When the blood supply to the feet is compromised, the chances of infections and amputations also increases. All diabetics should <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> mild elevations in blood pressure can be detrimental to health. Studies have shown that diabetics with even a slight elevation in blood pressure have 2-3 times {{the risk of heart disease}} compared to individuals without diabetes.|$|E
500|$|By the 1830s, the Sherwoods {{had become}} more prosperous and the family decided {{to travel to the}} continent. The texts that Sherwood wrote {{following}} this trip reflect her exposure to French culture in particular. She also embarked on a large and complex Old Testament project at this time, for which she learned Hebrew. To assist her, her husband assembled, over the course of ten years, a large Hebrew-English concordance. Unfortunately, Sherwood's autobiography provides scant details regarding the last forty-odd years of her life. [...] However, we do <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> in her seventies, Sherwood wrote for four or five hours a day; many of these books were co-authored with Sherwood's daughter, Sophia. [...] According to M. Nancy Cutt, a Sherwood scholar, this joint authorship led to a [...] "watery sentimentality" [...] not evident in Sherwood's earlier works as well as a greater emphasis on issues of class.|$|E
500|$|On Tuesday 27 February 2007, Saprang led a 13-member {{delegation}} to Europe, {{on what was}} {{claimed to be a}} week-long trip to study safety and security measures at major European airports. [...] Many delegates and accompanying members shared the same surname, and the trip, which cost 7.2 million baht was attacked for [...] "squandering" [...] state funds for personal pleasure, disbursing unrealistic expenses, and inflating costs. [...] The travel agent along received a 500,000 baht commission fee for booking the trip. [...] Saprang denied any wrongdoing and claimed he was the victim of a smear campaign. [...] He also noted that [...] "If you knew my character, you would <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if a relative joined the trip he should have realised that he should work hard." [...] He also noted that instead of being a viewed as a defendant, he should be viewed as a hero for bringing down the Thaksin government. [...] Saprang then summoned the leader of the AoT labor union in order to identify who leaked information about the trip to his accusers.|$|E
