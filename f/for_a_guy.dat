The deal saw Domenic Mobilio shipped to Philadelphia for Rick Titus, a player that only months earlier had walked out on the Drillers, and whom management had stated would never again be welcomed back. While on the surface, dealing a fan favourite and leading scorer <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> that was considered persona non grata doesn't quite add up, the underlying issue was that Mobilio had a falling out with management which led to the deal being brokered. This would also mark the third time Titus had been acquired by Edmonton.|$|E

[...] Similarly, Kill Hipsters called it [...] "one hell of a comeback <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> everyone–including myself–thought was well and truly dead and gone." [...] Loudwire's Graham Hartmann praised the album as a whole, as did Rick Florino of Artistdirect, who said: [...] "From top to bottom, it's Manson's most vicious and vibrant effort since Antichrist Superstar.

500|$|The next year, CTV, Canada's first private TV {{network and}} a fledgling {{competitor}} of his father's network, hired the 24-year-old Jennings as co-anchor of its late-night national newscast.

NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable.

500|$|The song {{received}} acclaim from critics. [...] James Montgomery of MTV News {{said of the}} song, [...] "there {{are moments}} on Stairs that stop you dead in your tracks, send shivers up your spine and make you go 'Whoa'... like the first four-and-a-half minutes of 'I Will Possess Your Heart,' a propulsive whirl of stalking bass line, spindly guitars and stabbing piano." [...] Will Hermes noted in Rolling Stone that the sense of menace in the song was [...] "playing against type <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> with one of rock's purest voices—a vibrato-less, bell-clear high tenor whose choirboy quality only throws the darkness here into relief." [...] Blender Jonah Weiner concurred, stating [...] "it's a pleasant surprise to hear Gibbard inhabit such a self-consciously creepy role, rather than play the occasionally errant, essentially good-hearted boyfriend who soft-shoes through {{so many of his}} tales." [...] In 2011, Tyler Kane of Paste included the song in a list of [...] "the 25 creepiest songs about love".|$|E
500|$|McConaughey and Harrelson {{were among}} a small pool of actors {{considered}} suitable candidates for top billing. Producers contracted McConaughey, {{who had recently}} finished filming Killer Joe (2011), well before True Detective was greenlit by HBO. Pizzolatto, impressed with the actor's performance in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), originally assigned him the role of Martin Hart, but McConaughey offered [...] "a really compelling argument" [...] for portraying Rustin [...] "Rust" [...] Cohle. When asked about his decision to switch parts in a Variety interview, McConaughey replied: [...] "I wanted to get in that dude’s head.

Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: [...] "I love the way Izzie lights up when she's around him.

[...] When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny's condition to move him up the transplant list, series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions, asking: [...] "is Izzie bad for doing it?

500|$|Because {{the series}} is an anthology, each season has a {{self-contained}} narrative, following a disparate set of characters in various settings. Pizzolatto began contemplating the lead roles while he was pitching the series to networks in early 2012. True Detective anthology format only required actors to commit to a single season, so Pizzolatto was able to attract film stars who normally avoid television series because of their busy schedules. Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey were among the actors Pizzolatto considered for star billing. McConaughey, who had recently finished filming Killer Joe (2011), was contracted well before HBO commissioned the season. Impressed with his performance in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), Pizzolatto at first assigned him to play Hart, but McConaughey convinced him {{to give him the}} part of Cohle. When asked in a Variety interview about his decision to switch parts, the actor replied, [...] "I wanted to get in that dude's head.

500|$|Though {{the initial}} {{growth of the}} fandom {{may have come from}} 4chan {{participants}} enjoying the ironic nature of grown men enjoying a show for girls, the fandom continues to grow based on sincere appreciation of the work. Robert Thompson, a professor of media studies at Syracuse University, stated that [...] "It's one thing for guys to like motorcycles and muscle cars and soccer. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> to like My Little Pony, it's so out there that it becomes almost avant garde. It has a hip quality to it." [...] According to Angela Watchcutter of Wired, the fandom is an example of internet neo-sincerity, where these older viewers watch the show [...] "un-ironically" [...] and [...] "without guilt" [...] breaking gender stereotypes, furthermore creating new material around it. Prof. Roberta Pearson of the University of Nottingham in film and television studies stated that [...] "This is a level of fan devotion I've not seen before," [...] while Prof. Charles Soukup of the University of Northern Colorado in communication studies suggested that this effort is an indication of the [...] "ultra-cult era" [...] that bronies exhibit, where [...] "media consumers discover extremely unexpected and obscure media texts to cultivate uniqueness and distinctiveness for their mediated identities".|$|E

Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: [...] "It was a hot day at Crosley Field and I remember being so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> his size, he had a real big delivery, nice to look at, and he had overcome a lot.

500|$|... "Flu Season" [...] also {{demonstrated}} a departure {{in the way}} Ann's romantic relationships were handled compared to past seasons. The character previously dated Andy Dwyer and Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), who was written out of the show {{at the end of}} the second season. In both cases, Ann was primarily in control of the relationship due to Andy's immaturity and Mark's lack of experience in long-term romances. Schur said of Ann's relationship with Chris, [...] "This is the first time that Ann just completely loses herself and really falls <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> super hard. And the relationship goes in a lot of funny, unexpected directions." [...] Intimidated by her inability to find a flaw in the extremely positive and physically perfect Chris, Ann acts more awkwardly and nerdy around him than her character has been in the past. [...] "Flu Season" [...] {{also demonstrated}} deeper levels to Ron Swanson, who adamantly insists [...] "I'm not interested in caring about people", yet reveals he cares about both Andy and April, and tries to help the two reconcile. Schur said Ron takes on a sort of father figure role, [...] "and he ends up revealing in a tiny, tiny, tiny way that's still true to the character that he has genuine feelings of caring for the people who work around him in the Parks office".|$|E

The music video premiered on October 26, 2012, at the Fun Size film premiere, and was released online on October 28, 2012. Directed by Justin Francis, the video starts with Jepsen and her fellow friends driving a Fiat 500. After they come out of the car, they follow to a '80s inspired warehouse, where Jepsen starts flirting with a guy (actor Kurt Collins). The guy is immediately attracted to her, and, as the video comes to a close, they dive in a pool and kiss.|$|E

Moss further elaborated, [...] "Albeit minor, her [...] verse (about falling <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> from the BK, as in Jay's Brooklyn stomping grounds) offers a rare moment of commentary on the couple, which has thus far only been chronicled by tabloid photographers." [...] The song opens with T.I. rhyming lines and glorifying the profound love [...] "between a thug and a thugette". As the song progresses, each member of Destiny's Child describes their own favorite type of man, later harmonizing together for the chorus. Midway through the song, Lil Wayne's verse contains a reference to rapper B.G..

Its production and melody is backed by strings and a drum machine beat. According to Spence D. of IGN Music, [...] "Hello" [...] comes off like another ballad that [...] "populate {{the first part of}} the album." [...] It contains the Jerry Maguire line – [...] "You had me at hello" [...] – as part of its chorus. It essentially consists of [...] "sweet guitar-picking and delicate harmonies." [...] According to critics, [...] "Video Phone" [...] contains lyrics that are in reference to [...] "a celebration of Skype sex and putting on a solo show, on camera, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> you just met at the club". The remixed version featured both Beyoncé and Lady Gaga trading verses with one another. Musically the song consists of simple lyrics, with hidden innuendos, and is backed by thin-spread beats; Beyoncé and Gaga uttering gasps and groans while singing the song. [...] "Disappear" [...] consists of [...] "sweet guitar-picking and delicate harmonies". [...] "That's Why You're Beautiful" [...] is a slow-tempo soft rock and rock power ballad, which consists of a [...] "grungy" [...] guitar riff and stuterring drums.

500|$|During {{production}} of Supernaturals first season, Morgan was {{also working on}} the shows Weeds and Grey's Anatomy, so he was often traveling {{back and forth between}} Los Angeles and Vancouver, British Columbia. This interfered at times with Morgan's acting, as he had trouble getting [...] "Winchester-y enough" [...] after portraying the nice character of Denny Duquette on Grey's Anatomy. Morgan commented, [...] "I was stuck in Denny-land, where I was being too nice. Winchester's harder to find. Denny's more me. He's an intense guy, John is. And Denny, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who's having trouble living, he's just a charming dude." [...] Morgan was at first reluctant to return for Supernaturals second season due to his role on Grey's Anatomy. Although he lent his voice for the third season episode [...] "Long-Distance Call," [...] future appearances of Morgan as the character after the second season have been hindered due to the actor's busy schedule. Nevertheless, both Kripke and writer Sera Gamble have stated that they [...] "would love to have him back." [...] The scheduling conflict has continued into the sixth season of Supernatural, with executive producer Robert Singer revealing that the writers had considered bringing the character back in the alternate reality episode [...] "My Heart Will Go On" [...] instead of Ellen Harvelle, but due to concerns {{that they would not be}} able to secure Morgan's return, they ultimately chose Ellen for the deceased character they would have (temporarily) return in the episode. During the {{production of}} the fifth season, Morgan had an interview with MovieWeb in which he stated that no one from the show had contacted him about making another appearance, and expressed the desire to return for at least one more episode in what was then-believed to be the show's final season, as he had enjoying working with on-screen sons Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki and he felt that John's storyline had ended too soon.|$|E
