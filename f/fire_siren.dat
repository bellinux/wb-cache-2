5|$|During World War II, {{more than}} 340 of the village's 1,830 {{residents}} {{served in the}} United States Armed Forces. The Hook and Ladder Company waived fees and dues for those enlisted from 1941 onward. Such {{a sufficient number of}} firefighters was serving the armed forces that the village requested volunteers ages 16–18 to join the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department; at least nine served on active duty during the war and had the ability to excuse themselves from school (which was then located adjacent to Law Memorial Park) if the <b>fire</b> <b>siren</b> went off. Also during the war, in 1944, the department received a trailer-type pump unit with a 500-gallon pump, hose, nozzle, ladders, and other tools. It was loaned to the village by the Office of Civil Defense and was an auxiliary to the existing equipment. One year later, Briarcliff High School graduate and Briarcliff Fire Company lieutenant Sgt. Arthur J. Quinn, Jr. of the 45th Division was killed in action in Germany.|$|E

500|$|Faced {{with the}} {{oncoming}} miner army, Chafin {{put into place}} plans he had been forming since early summer. [...] Chafin had formed {{a small army of}} several hundred volunteers, composed of his deputies, mine guards, and members of the Logan County middle class, and had begun to train them in June. He established large weapons caches, including a stockpile of machine guns, and erected breastworks on the slopes of Blair Mountain. [...] At around 2 a.m. on August 25, Chafin turned on the <b>fire</b> <b>siren</b> in the town of Logan, calling together his army. [...] By morning, 700 members of his volunteer army were assembled on the slopes of Blair Mountain. In addition to his land forces, Chafin established a small air force, composed of three biplanes that he rented from private owners for use in reconnaissance.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} way of summoning volunteer firemen to a {{fire was}} by ringing of a bell, either mounted atop the fire station, {{or in the}} belfry of a local church. As electricity became available, the first <b>fire</b> <b>sirens</b> were manufactured. In 1886 French electrical engineer Gustave Trouvé, developed a siren to announce the silent arrival of his electric boats. Two early <b>fire</b> <b>sirens</b> were the Decot siren and Sterling Siren. Both started manufacturing <b>fire</b> <b>sirens</b> around 1900 to 1905. Many communities have since deactivated their <b>fire</b> <b>sirens</b> as pagers became available for fire department use.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>sirens</b> {{are often}} called [...] "fire whistles", [...] "fire alarms", or [...] "fire horns". Although {{there is no}} {{standard}} signaling of <b>fire</b> <b>sirens,</b> some utilize codes to inform firefighters of {{the location of the}} <b>fire.</b> Civil defense <b>sirens</b> pulling double duty as <b>fire</b> <b>sirens</b> often can produce an alternating [...] "hi-lo" [...] signal (similar to a British police car) as the fire signal, or a slow wail (typically 3x) as to not confuse the public with the standard civil defense signals of alert (steady tone) and attack (fast wavering tone). <b>Fire</b> <b>sirens</b> are often blasted once a day at noon and are also called [...] "noon sirens" [...] or [...] "noon whistles".|$|R
25|$|Many <b>fire</b> <b>sirens</b> (used {{for calling}} the {{volunteer}} fire fighters) serve double duty as tornado or civil defense sirens, alerting an entire community of impending danger. Most <b>fire</b> <b>sirens</b> are either {{mounted on the}} roof of a fire station or on a pole next to the <b>fire</b> station. <b>Fire</b> <b>sirens</b> can also be mounted on or near government buildings, on tall structures such as water towers, as well as in systems where several sirens are distributed around a town for better sound coverage. Most <b>fire</b> <b>sirens</b> are single tone and mechanically driven by electric motors with a rotor attached to the shaft. Some newer sirens are electronically driven speakers.|$|R

2500|$|Following {{a violent}} thunderstorm, David Drayton leaves his wife Stephanie at home while he ventures into town with his eight-year-old son Billy and their neighbor, Brent Norton, to buy {{supplies}} for repairs. Arriving at a grocery store, {{they and the}} other patrons notice unusual police and military activity. Moments later, a panicked and injured man, Dan, runs into the store, warning of danger. Soon after, a thick mist envelops the store, accompanied by earthquake-like tremors, setting off the town's <b>fire</b> <b>siren.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Steam {{whistles}} {{were also}} used as a warning device if a supply of steam was present, such as a sawmill or factory. These were common before fire sirens became widely available. Fire horns, large compressed air horns, also were and still are used {{as an alternative to}} a <b>fire</b> <b>siren.</b> Many fire horn systems were wired to fire pull boxes that were located around a town, and thus would [...] "blast out" [...] a code in respect to that boxes location. For example, pull box number 233, when pulled, would trigger the fire horn to sound two blasts, followed by a pause, followed by three blasts, followed by a pause, followed by three more blasts. In the days before telephones, this was the only way firefighters would know the location of a fire. The coded blasts were usually repeated several times. This technology was also applied to many steam whistles as well. Some fire sirens are fitted with brakes and dampers, enabling them to sound out codes as well. These units tended to be unreliable, and are now uncommon.|$|E

2500|$|In 1938, with {{significant}} new supporting evidence, {{it was reported}} {{on the pages of}} Popular Science Monthly that the human vocal cords function like a <b>fire</b> <b>siren</b> to produce a harmonic-rich tone, which is then filtered by the vocal tract to produce different vowel tones. By the time, the additive Hammond organ was already on market. Most early electronic organ makers thought it too expensive to manufacture the plurality of oscillators required by additive organs, and began instead to build subtractive ones. In a 1940 Institute of Radio Engineers meeting, the head field engineer of Hammond elaborated on the company's new Novachord as having a “subtractive system” in contrast to the original Hammond organ in which “the final tones were built up by combining sound waves”. Alan Douglas used the qualifiers additive and subtractive to describe different types of electronic organs in a 1948 paper presented to the Royal Musical Association. [...] The contemporary wording additive synthesis and subtractive synthesis can be found in his 1957 book The electrical production of music, in which he categorically lists three methods of forming of musical tone-colours, in sections titled Additive synthesis, Subtractive synthesis, and Other forms of combinations.|$|E

50|$|The Cherry Grove Fire Department (CGFD) {{is a low}} {{incident}} department. The CGFD {{also has}} pull stations located at every other street corner where unique hose houses contain vital equipment that would be needed by the members to suppress any fire; {{this is due to}} the unique nature of Cherry Grove. There are no roads, only boardwalks, hence no ability to respond with a fire engine. If a fire or emergency is spotted, one should call 911 or run to the nearest street corner and pull the lever down. A <b>fire</b> <b>siren</b> is activated, which alerts the members to respond. CGFD is one of the few fire departments in New York that still uses a manual pull station system.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the times}} before modern radio communications, it was {{difficult}} for emergency services such as volunteer fire departments to alert their members to an emergency, since the members were not based at the station. The earliest methods of sounding an alarm would typically be by ringing a bell either at the fire station or the local church. As electricity became available, most fire departments used <b>fire</b> <b>sirens</b> or whistles to summon volunteers (many fire departments still use outdoor sirens and horns along with pagers to alert volunteers). Other methods included specialized phones placed inside the volunteer firefighter's home or business or by base radios or scanners. [...] "Plectron" [...] radio receivers were very popular, but were limited to 120VAC or 12VDC operation, limiting their use to a house/building or mounted in a vehicle. There was a great need and desire for a portable radio small enough to be worn by a person and only activated when needed. Thus, Motorola answered this call in the 1970s and released the very first Minitor pager.|$|R

50|$|Sanders Store, {{southwest}} corner. Originally it {{was built}} in 1850 for a general store. In 1907 it began several years of renovations to convert it to its later use as Stafford's town hall (it has been vacant since the town moved to a newer building a short distance to the north on Route 237). Its combination of hip and gabled roof is one feature that reflects a combination of Greek Revival and vernacular influences. Other decorative touches include a cornice with pilasters supporting a large architrave, fan window with leaded glass in the north (front) gable field, and hip-roofed dormer window with diagonally muntined windows on the east elevation. An open-belfry tower with pyramidal roof on the northeast corner supports a modern <b>fire</b> <b>siren.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{volunteer}} fire department is normally {{reached the same}} way as other emergency services, such as by calling 9-1-1 or 1-1-2. A central dispatcher then calls out the VFD, often through equipment such as pagers, radios, or loud signals, such as a <b>fire</b> <b>siren.</b> Average response times are longer than with full-time services because the members must come from different distances to the station or to the incident. Such departments often have a fixed number of firefighters on staff at any given point in time, which sometimes equals the minimal numbers recommended. Some states allow the use of Length of Service Award Programs (LOSAPS) to provide these volunteer departments with a tool to assist in recruiting and retaining members. LOSAPS are simple programs that can be implemented with minimal taxpayer expense.|$|E

50|$|As {{the coffin}} reached {{the middle of}} the Red Square, it would be removed from the {{carriage}} and placed on a red-draped bier facing the Lenin Mausoleum, with its lid removed. After a series of funeral speeches, which were delivered by military and political leaders (typically including the deceased's successor as General Secretary, as well as 'ordinary' workers) from the balcony of the Lenin Mausoleum, the coffin would be carried in a procession around the mausoleum to the Kremlin Wall Necropolis just behind it. There, with the most senior mourners looking on, the coffin would be placed on a red-draped bier and the mourners would pay last respects. The coffin's lid would then be closed for the final time and the body lowered into the ground by two men, with handfuls of earth thrown onto the coffin by the senior mourners. The grave would be filled in immediately afterward, while the mourners were still present to watch. Gun salutes would be <b>fired,</b> <b>sirens</b> sounded around the Kremlin and the Soviet national anthem be played. This marked the end of the interment. The senior mourners would then return to the balcony of the Lenin Mausoleum to review a parade on Red Square while the military band would play quick marches. This concluded the state funeral.|$|R
