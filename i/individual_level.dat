On an <b>individual</b> <b>level,</b> Oliver Queen received his own tie-in that provided Sprint users with animated episodes depicting Oliver's backstory on their mobile phones. Overall, the reception for the characters has been mixed. Critics have viewed Ritchson's acting ability and the shortened introductory storylines for the team negatively, while the characters of Green Arrow and Black Canary were viewed more positively.|$|E

But, when implemented in a group setting in an organization, some form of efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved, especially with regard to better output. This is especially true when the Bureaucratic model emphasizes qualification (merits), specialization of job-scope (labour), hierarchy of power, rules and discipline.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs was {{appointed}} club captain {{at the start}} of the 1992–93 season. The team started the season with three First Division defeats in their opening six games, keeping just one clean sheet. However, on an <b>individual</b> <b>level</b> the season was to get even worse for Gibbs. He sustained a knee injury against Notts County on 7 September 1992, putting him out of first team contention for six weeks. During his comeback, at home to Tranmere Rovers, Gibbs aggravated the previous injury, putting him out of action for more than two years. Concern over the injury, coupled with the good form of Gerard Lavin, restricted Gibbs' opportunities under Glenn Roeder in 1994–95.|$|E

The battle sequences in Advent Children also served as inspiration for Motomu Toriyama when creating the battle system for Final Fantasy XIII. Former staff members have blamed the Compilation, in conjunction with other extensions of titles like Final Fantasy X, for undermining the series' market presence and fan trust in the West.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} {{title in}} the series, Fire Emblem Awakening, was planned {{to be the last}} in the series due to decreasing sales. The game was a worldwide commercial success, prompting Nintendo to greenlight a new entry. Fates was co-developed by regular Fire Emblem developer Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD, with the main staff of Awakening returning to their respective roles for Fates: they were Intelligence System's Kouhei Maeda as director, Nintendo SPD director Genki Yokota, Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami, art director Toshiyuki Kusakihara, and character designer Yūsuke Kozaki. Yokota's work on the game ran parallel with his work on Xenoblade Chronicles X. Masahiro Higuchi, Awakenings project manager, came on board as a producer. According to the original staff, the request for a sequel was a shock as they had all developed Awakening assuming it would be the last in the series. During its early design stages, Fates was given the working title Fire Emblem 3DS II. The game's cutscenes were animated by Studio Anima, while storyboarding was handled by Spooky Graphic. To develop the multiple versions, one core team worked on the game's shared assets, while additional teams handled <b>individual</b> <b>level</b> design.|$|E

Further, we show that, by stratifying based {{on a set of}} discrete variables, the proposed statistical procedure can be formulated {{so that it can be}} used to analyze automated records which do not contain observations at <b>individual</b> <b>levels,</b> only summarized information at categorical levels.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the risk {{attitude}} {{of a group}} of heterogeneous agents and we develop a theory of comparative collective risk tolerance. In particular, we characterize how shifts in the distribution of <b>individual</b> <b>levels</b> of risk tolerance a¤ect the groups attitude towards risk. In a model with e ¢ cient risk-sharing and two agents an increase in the level of risk tolerance of one or of both agents might have an ambiguous impact on the collective level of risk tolerance; the latter increases for some levels of aggregate wealth while it decreases for other levels of aggregate wealth. For more general populations we characterize the e¤ect of 8 ̆ 5 rst-order like shifts (<b>individual</b> <b>levels</b> of risk tolerance more concentrated on high values) and second-order like shifts (more dispersion on <b>individual</b> <b>levels</b> of risk tolerance) on the collective level of risk tolerance. We also evaluate how shifts in the distribution of <b>individual</b> <b>levels</b> of risk tolerance impact the collective level of risk tolerance in a framework with exogenous egalitarian sharing rules. Our results permit to better characterize di¤erences in risk taking behavior between groups and individuals and among groups with di¤erent distributions of risk preferences. ...|$|R

25|$|Group selection. It has {{controversially}} {{been argued}} by some evolutionary scientists such as David Sloan Wilson that natural selection can act {{at the level}} of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the <b>individual</b> <b>level.</b> Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the <b>individual</b> <b>level,</b> according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons. Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members (See also in-group favoritism). Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists.|$|E
