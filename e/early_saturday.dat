Initially, {{the series}} was shown on the channel's Adult Swim {{programming}} block from February 2002 to April 2003, but was later moved to Toonami. Some of the show's original depictions of mature content including violence, sexual humor, and coarse language, {{as well as some}} controversial cultural discrepancies were edited out for broadcast. Yu Yu Hakusho was taken off Toonami around March 2005 and moved to an <b>early</b> <b>Saturday</b> morning time slot that October where the series finished its run.

25|$|The {{programme}} {{was intended}} to be educational and for family viewing on the <b>early</b> <b>Saturday</b> evening schedule. It initially alternated stories set in the past, which taught younger audience members about history, and with those in the future or outer space, focusing on science. This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher.|$|E
25|$|Wogan's {{first foray}} into TV interviewing, and indeed to British television, was in 1972 on Lunchtime with Wogan on ITV.

25|$|In December 1962 Sydney Newman left ABC {{to take up}} the {{position}} of Head of Drama at BBC Television, and the following year Lambert joined him at the Corporation. Newman had recruited her to produce Doctor Who, a programme he had personally initiated. Conceived by Newman as an educational science-fiction serial for <b>early</b> <b>Saturday</b> evenings, the programme concerned the adventures of an old man travelling through space and time in his TARDIS, disguised as a police box. In some quarters, the series was not expected to last longer than thirteen weeks.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{regulations}} {{defined by}} the Children's Television Act that require stations to carry E/I compliant programming for three hours each week at any time between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. local time, some NBC stations may defer certain programs aired within its Saturday morning block to Sunday daytime or <b>earlier</b> <b>Saturday</b> morning slots, or (in the case of affiliates in the Western United States) Saturday afternoons as makegoods {{to comply with the}} CTA regulations.|$|R

25|$|The omnibus edition, a {{compilation}} of the week's episodes in a continuous sequence, originally aired on BBC One on Sunday afternoons, until 1 April 2012 when it was changed to a late Friday night or <b>early</b> <b>Saturday</b> morning slot, commencing 6 April 2012, though the exact time differed. It reverted to a weekend daytime slot as from January 2013 on BBC Two. In 2014, the omnibus moved back to around midnight on Friday nights, and in April 2015, the omnibus was axed, following detailed audience research {{and the introduction of}} 30-day catch up on BBC iPlayer and the planning of BBC One +1. The last omnibus on the BBC was shown on 24 April 2015. When W took over the same-day repeat of EastEnders, they also returned the weekend omnibus.|$|E
25|$|On February 1, 2006, Liberty Corporation {{merged with}} Raycom Media. In November 2006, WFIE added The Tube (a 24-hour music video channel {{similar to the}} early years of MTV) on digital channel 14.3 along with many other Raycom Media stations. In summer 2007, The Tube shut down from the lack of {{advertiser}} support and this station ceased programming on 14.3 for the time. WFIE, along with many Raycom Media stations, added This TV to 14.3 on February 4, 2009. On November 1, 2013, This TV ceased programming on 14.3 after Tribune Broadcasting bought out Weigel Broadcasting's ownership of the network. WFIE, along with some other stations, added Movies! to 14.3 on November 1, 2013. WFIE replaced its Movies! affiliation on 14.3 that same day with MeTV, to have it kept in the area. On October 28, 2014 at 12:00 noon, 14Xtra was replaced with the MeTV affiliation from the 14.3 subchannel. At the same time, MeTV from 14.3 was replaced with a free-to-air movie network called Grit, meaning {{that there will be no}} more weather channels that are on broadcast TV in the area. Secondary affiliations on 14.2 are college basketball on <b>early</b> <b>Saturday</b> afternoons from the ACC Network (which is owned by Raycom Media) for its airings at that time, which was the same since the change.|$|E

Doctor Who continued {{to be one of}} BBC's flagship programmes throughout Davies' tenure, and resulted in record sales of the show's official magazine, an increase in spin-off novels, and the launch of the children's magazine Doctor Who Adventures and toy sonic screwdrivers and Daleks. The show's popularity ultimately led to a resurgence in family-orientated Saturday night drama; the ITV science-fiction series Primeval and the BBC historical dramas Robin Hood and Merlin were specifically designed for an <b>early</b> <b>Saturday</b> evening timeslot. Davies was also approached by the BBC to produce several spin-off series, eventually creating two: Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures.|$|E
