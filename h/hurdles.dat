5|$|By far {{the most}} common events are the 100 metres <b>hurdles</b> for women, 110m <b>hurdles</b> for men and 400m <b>hurdles</b> for both sexes. The men's 110m has been {{featured}} at every modern Summer Olympics while the men's 400m {{was introduced in the}} second edition of the Games. Women's initially competed in the 80 metres <b>hurdles</b> event, which entered the Olympic programme in 1932. This was extended to the 100m <b>hurdles</b> at the 1972 Olympics, {{but it was not until}} 1984 that a women's 400m <b>hurdles</b> event took place at the Olympics (having been introduced at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics the previous year).|$|E
5|$|Men {{and women}} have {{different}} weights for their throwing implements – men's javelin is 800 grams compared to 600 for women, men's weight throw is 35 pounds compared to 20 for women, men's discus is 2 kilograms to women's 1, men's shot put is 16 pounds compared to 8 pounds for women, and men's hammer throw is also 16 pounds to the women's 8. Additionally, men's high <b>hurdles</b> are at height of 42 inches compared to women's <b>hurdles</b> which are 33 inches. For the intermediate <b>hurdles</b> (400 meter <b>hurdles),</b> the men's hurdle height is 36 inches compared to 30 inches for women.|$|E
5|$|Races with <b>hurdles</b> as {{obstacles}} {{were first}} popularised in the 19th century in England. The first known event, held in 1830, was {{a variation of}} the 100-yard dash that included heavy wooden barriers as obstacles. A competition between the Oxford and Cambridge Athletic Clubs in 1864 refined this, holding a 120-yard race (110m) with ten <b>hurdles</b> of 3-foot and 6inches (1.06m) in height (each placed 10 yards (9m) apart), with the first and final <b>hurdles</b> 15 yards from the start and finish, respectively. French organisers adapted the race into metric (adding 28cm) and the basics of this race, the men's 110 metres <b>hurdles,</b> has remained largely unchanged. The origin of the 400 metres <b>hurdles</b> also lies in Oxford, where (around 1860) a competition was held over 440yards and twelve 1.06m high wooden barriers were placed along the course. The modern regulations stem from the 1900 Summer Olympics: the distance was fixed to 400m while ten 3-foot (91.44cm) <b>hurdles</b> were placed 35m apart on the track, with the first and final <b>hurdles</b> being 45m and 40m away from the start and finish, respectively. Women's <b>hurdles</b> are slightly lower at 84cm (2ft 9in) for the 100m event and 76cm (2ft 6in) for the 400m event.|$|E
