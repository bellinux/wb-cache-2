5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1851, women in several states were wearing the dress in public. In March, Amelia Bloomer, editor of the temperance {{newspaper}} The Lily, announced that she was wearing it and printed a description of her dress along with {{instructions on how to}} make it. Soon, newspapers had <b>dubbed</b> <b>it</b> the “Bloomer dress”, and the name stuck.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the firm}} {{intention}} of Sandy Pearlman and Albert Bouchard {{to salvage the}} project, the recordings remained unfinished and untouched {{for more than two}} years due to lack of funding. While struggling with the long, complex and expensive production of the Blue Öyster Cult's album Club Ninja, Pearlman associated himself with Daniel J. Levitin, A director of the local punk label 415 Records, with whom shared academic interests in neuroscience. In 1986, Pearlman leased Studio C of San Francisco's Hyde Street Recording Studios, and <b>dubbed</b> <b>it</b> Alpha & Omega Studios. Pearlman and Levitin produced various bands there, and Pearlman sub-leased the studio to other producers. In September 1986, when the poor sales of Club Ninja resulted in a commercial failure and the group disbanded, the lack of new material from the band for the foreseeable future prompted Pearlman to propose Imaginos to Columbia Records as a new Blue Öyster Cult album. He obtained a small budget from the record label to remix the album and to add the vocals of Roeser and Bloom, singers of all the hits produced by Blue Öyster Cult.|$|E
5|$|The Tamil remake {{rights to}} Siva were {{initially}} sold for 100,000. After the film's release, Venkat and Surendra <b>dubbed</b> <b>it</b> into Tamil as Udhayam and sold its distribution rights for 8.5 million. Released on 12 January 1990 in 24 centres, Udhayam was commercially successful and {{earned more than}} 20million. Nagarjuna's father Akkineni Nageswara Rao advised Varma to place an advertisement thanking the audience for the film's success. Varma opposed it, believing that a film's success should be credited to the production team and its failure attributed to the director. When Varma's second film, Kshana Kshanam (1991) under-performed at the box office, Siva success was considered accidental. In addition to the Filmfare Award for Best Film– Telugu, Siva won three Nandi Awards: Best Director (Varma), Best First Film of a Director, and Best Dialogue Writer (Bharani).|$|E
50|$|In 2013, an {{animated}} film <b>dubbed</b> <b>It’s</b> Glass Mask But... the Movie: Female Spy’s Love! The Purple Rose Has a Dangerous Scent!? was released.

5|$|Between January and March 2010, the Australian monsoon trough {{extended}} unusually {{far east}} over the southern Pacific Ocean. With above-average sea surface temperatures, {{stemming from a}} moderate-strength El Niño, multiple low pressure systems were able to develop across the region. An unusual spree of tropical cyclogenesis in rapid succession ensued, including four hurricane-strength storms: Oli, Pat, Rene, and Tomas. On February6, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) began monitoring a tropical depression, dubbed 09F, well to the northeast of the Samoan Islands. Embedded within a well-developed trough, the system displayed curved convective banding features. Environmental conditions in the area, including low wind shear, high ocean heat content, and upper-level outflow, favored cyclogenesis. Additionally, an active Madden–Julian oscillation phase moving into the region was expected to bolster development. Steady improvement of the system's convective structure ensued and early on February7, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. The low trekked generally east-southeast {{in response to a}} near-equatorial ridge anchored to the north. The storm's appearance continued to improve and Dvorak classifications rose to T2.5, indicating gale-force winds were likely present. Accordingly, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the system at 18:00UTC and <b>dubbed</b> <b>it</b> Tropical Cyclone 14P. Forecasters noted, however, that the small size of the cyclone could lead to erroneously low Dvorak estimates. The FMS followed suit six hours later and assigned the name Pat to the cyclone, assessing it as a Category1 on the Australian cyclone scale.|$|E
5|$|Theme Park took {{roughly a}} year and a half to develop. Much of the code was used in Theme Hospital, and an {{animation}} editor was improved by Theme Hospitals designer and producer Mark Webley, who <b>dubbed</b> <b>it</b> The Complex Engine. Artist Gary Carr did not think the game was a good idea, and disliked the art style. Molyneux wanted him to create a colourful style to appeal to a Japanese market, but Carr disagreed and left Bullfrog. Carr later retracted his beliefs and, in 2012, stated that he considered the game a classic. In 1994, Molyneux was developing both Theme Park and Magic Carpet. The game was mostly complete by January 1994 and scheduled for release on 28 March, but this was pushed back to June, and then August. Theme Park sold over 15 million copies, and was extremely popular in Japan (the Japanese PlayStation version sold 85 thousand copies within weeks), as well as Europe. Theme Park did not sell well in the United States; Molyneux hypothesised that this was because the graphics are too childish for American audiences. The game is the first instalment in Bullfrog's Designer Series, and it was intended for the series to use Theme Parks engine and for each instalment to have three simulation levels. The PC version was sponsored by Midland Bank.|$|E

25|$|VyborgPetrozavodsk Offensive (9 June – 9 August 1944). This {{offensive}} {{was against}} the Finnish forces north of Leningrad and its strategic objective was to force Finland out of the war.

Stalin <b>dubbed</b> <b>it</b> the Liberation of Karelia-Finland Soviet Republic.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1991, India {{travelled}} to Australia for a five Test series, to {{be followed}} by the World Cup. Channel 9 <b>dubbed</b> <b>it</b> the Indian Summer. The series was a disaster for India – they lost four of the Tests – and was rife with umpiring controversies. But it also saw the final flourishes in the careers of Shastri and Kapil Dev.|$|E
25|$|The Hmong general {{called the}} new {{offensive}} operation Kou Kiet (Redeemed Honor). His CIA contacts <b>dubbed</b> <b>it</b> Operation About Face when they approved it. No matter the name, it was patterned on the previous Operation Raindance, planned as a three-week attack with the major firepower being tactical air. Newly arrived Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley messaged his superiors in the U.S. State Department that the military situation on the Plain of Jars was so crucial that if fighter-bombers would not suffice for Kou Kiet, Arc Light strikes by B-52s {{should be considered as}} a followup.|$|E

25|$|The common {{mushroom}} has {{a complicated}} taxonomic history. It was first described by English botanist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in his 1871 Handbook of British Fungi, as a variety (var. hortensis) of Agaricus campestris. Danish mycologist Jakob Emanuel Lange later reviewed a cultivar specimen, and <b>dubbed</b> <b>it</b> Psalliota hortensis var. bispora in 1926. In 1938, it {{was promoted to}} species status and renamed Psalliota bispora. Emil Imbach (18971970) imparted the current scientific name of the species, Agaricus bisporus, after the genus Psalliota was renamed to Agaricus in 1946. The specific epithet bispora distinguishes the two-spored basidia from four-spored varieties.|$|E
25|$|The {{first time}} the U.S. Coast Guard found one {{containing}} drugs, authorities <b>dubbed</b> <b>it</b> Bigfoot because they had heard rumors that such things existed, but none had actually been seen. In late 2006 a Bigfoot was seized 145km southwest of Costa Rica carrying several metric tonnes of cocaine. In 2006, US officials say they detected three; in 2008, they were spotting an average of ten per month, but {{only one out of}} ten was intercepted. Few were seized, as their crews scuttle them upon interception and they sink within a minute or so. By 2009, the U.S.A. detected as many as 60 narco submarine related events, and it was calculated that they were moving as much as 330 metric tonnes of cocaine per year.|$|E
25|$|With another general {{election}} approaching in 1970 a Conservative policy document {{emerged from the}} Selsdon Park Hotel that offered free-market oriented policies as solutions to the country's unemployment and inflation problems. Heath stated that the Selsdon weekend only reaffirmed policies that had actually been evolving since he became leader of the Conservative Party. The Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, thought the document a vote-loser and <b>dubbed</b> <b>it</b> the product of Selsdon Man – after the supposedly prehistoric Piltdown Man – to portray it as reactionary. Heath's Conservative Party won the {{general election}} of 1970 with 330 seats to Labour's 287. The new cabinet included Margaret Thatcher (Education and Science), William Whitelaw (Leader of the House of Commons) and {{the former prime minister}} Alec Douglas-Home (Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs).|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Arizona hired Oklahoma {{defensive}} coordinator Mike Stoops, brother of famed Oklahoma {{head football coach}} Bob Stoops, {{to take over the}} Wildcat football program. Under Stoops, Arizona started 6–18; his job was in critical danger and his margin for error was very thin. However, in his third season in 2006, Stoops led the Wildcats to an improved 6–6 record, the first non-losing season for the school since 1998 when the Wildcats went 12–1. In 2008, the Wildcats earned their first bowl berth in a decade, defeating BYU by a score of 31–21. In 2009, the Wildcats earned their second straight bowl berth and a second straight eight-win season. On November 21, 2009, the Oregon Ducks came to Arizona Stadium in a game that would decide which team went to the Rose Bowl. ESPN's College GameDay crew <b>dubbed</b> <b>it</b> as the game of the week and ventured down to Tucson to cover it. After a back and forth battle, the Oregon Ducks won in double overtime 44–41 to clinch the Rose Bowl bid. Arizona was defeated 33–0 by Nebraska in a rematch of the 1998 Holiday Bowl. Following the Holiday Bowl, offensive coordinator Sonny Dykes left the Wildcat program to become the head coach at Louisiana Tech, and {{defensive coordinator}} Mark Stoops, a brother of Mike, became the defensive coordinator at Florida State. To replace them, Mike Stoops promoted Bill Bedenbaugh and Seth Littrell to co-offensive coordinators, while promoting Tim Kish to be co-defensive coordinators with Greg Brown, who was hired from Colorado.|$|E
