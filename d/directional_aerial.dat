25|$|German beacons {{operated}} on the medium-frequency band and the signals involved a two-letter Morse identifier {{followed by a}} lengthy time-lapse which enabled the Luftwaffe crews to determine the signal's bearing. The Meacon system involved separate locations for a receiver with a <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> and a transmitter. The receipt of the German signal by the receiver was duly passed to the transmitter, the signal to be repeated. The action did not guarantee automatic success. If the German bomber flew closer to its own beam than the Meacon then the former signal would come through the stronger on the direction finder. The reverse would apply only if the meacon were closer. In general, German bombers were likely {{to get through to}} their targets without too much difficulty. It was to be some months before an effective night fighter force would be ready, and anti-aircraft defences only became adequate after the Blitz was over, so ruses were created to lure German bombers away from their targets. Throughout 1940, dummy airfields were prepared, good enough to stand up to skilled observation. An unknown number of bombs fell on these diversionary ("Starfish") targets.|$|E

50|$|The main VHF/FM {{transmitter}} {{moved to}} Holme Moss on 92.4 MHz, covering most of West Yorkshire. Unusually, this transmitter also transmits neighbouring services Radio Manchester and Radio Sheffield from separate <b>directional</b> <b>aerials</b> on the mast.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmitter}} uses <b>directional</b> <b>aerials</b> of four guyed, insulated {{radio masts}} which are 270, 276, 280, and 282 metres high.Furthermore {{there is a}} backup aerial, which consists of two guyed insulated radio masts with a height of 234 metres.|$|R

50|$|It uses a <b>directional</b> <b>aerial,</b> {{consisting}} of a 330 m high and a 289 m high guyed grounded mast 330 metres apart. The taller mast is Poland's eighth highest structure.|$|E
50|$|The <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> for 1296 kHz (erected in 1978) {{consisted}} of six freestanding steel lattice towers. Unlike the <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> for 648 kHz, they were arranged in two parallel rows with three towers in each. Only the middle tower of each three was driven; the other towers acted as passive reflector and director elements. It was beamed at 96 degrees (i.e. east) and was originally mainly intended for night-time (skywave) coverage of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary {{and the western}} USSR, key target areas for the BBC during the Cold War. It {{could also be used}} for daytime coverage of the Netherlands and Belgium.|$|E
50|$|Both the 648 and 1296 <b>directional</b> <b>aerials</b> {{had limited}} {{radiation}} to the west, meaning that, despite the high {{power of the}} transmitters, reception of Orfordness within the UK was poor or non-existent, with the notable exception of parts of south-east England (including London) and East Anglia.|$|R

50|$|Cellular {{wireless}} networks {{generally have}} good capacity, {{due to their}} use of <b>directional</b> <b>aerials,</b> {{and their ability to}} reuse radio channels in non-adjacent cells. Additionally, cells can be made very small using low power transmitters this is used in cities to give network capacity that scales linearly with population density.|$|R
50|$|The {{radio station}} {{is located in}} Smith Street, Fitzroy, Victoria. Initially {{broadcasting}} on 837 kHz, 3CR now broadcasts on 855 kHz at 2 kW into a <b>directional</b> <b>aerial,</b> from a site at Hoppers Crossing about 15 km west of Melbourne.|$|E
50|$|The longwave {{transmitter}} uses a <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> with {{a maximum}} strength pointing northwest (azimuth: 309°). It consists of three 300 m-high guyed masts, which are insulated against ground and ground-fed. As a backup a 330 m-high guyed, ground-fed lattice steel mast radiator {{is available on the}} site, which only allows an omnidirectional radiation pattern.|$|E
50|$|The Junglinster Longwave Transmitter is a longwave {{broadcasting}} facility used by RTL near Junglinster, Luxembourg, {{which went}} into service in 1932. Its aerial {{consists of three}} free-standing steel-framework towers, which are ground fed radiators. These towers formed a <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> for the frequency 234 kHz and until 1980 were 250 metres high. Since 1980 their height has been 215 metres.|$|E
2500|$|Only {{a handful}} of radio {{stations}} were given new licences during the 1940s, 1950s & 1960s but, since 1975, many hundreds of new broadcasting licences have been issued on both the FM and AM bands. [...] In the latter case, this {{was made possible by}} having 9kHz between stations, rather than 10kHz breaks, as per the Geneva Frequency Plan. The installation of <b>directional</b> <b>aerials</b> also encouraged more AM stations.|$|R
5000|$|A {{major role}} in keeping the Dutch {{resistance}} alive was played by the BBC, Radio Oranje, the broadcasting service of the Dutch government-in-exile and [...] which broadcast from the Southern {{part of the country}} during liberation. Listening to either programme was forbidden and after about a year the Germans decided to confiscate all Dutch radio receivers. About half of all sets were taken, the rest went underground. With some listeners managing to replace their sets with homemade receivers. Surprisingly the authorities failed to outlaw the publication of magazine articles explaining how to build sets or the sale of the necessary materials until many months later. When they eventually did there were leaflets dropped from British planes containing instructions on building sets and <b>directional</b> <b>aerials</b> to circumvent German jamming.|$|R
5000|$|Franklin {{received}} British patent 242342 in 1924 for [...] "a pronounced <b>directional</b> {{effect from}} <b>aerials</b> {{of the type}} that are electrically long {{in comparison with the}} signal wavelength".|$|R
50|$|Restriction by the waveplan of Copenhagen had the result, {{that the}} medium wave {{transmitter}} of the Bavarian Broadcasting Company {{had to work with}} directional radiation with minimum toward Northeast after 1951 at nighttime. This type of radiation was not possible with the aerial on the wood framework tower and a <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> consisting of two insulated guyed radio masts with a height of 94 metres had to be built.|$|E
5000|$|Also located here at [...] was a 50 m steel {{framework}} mast insulated against ground. It {{was part of}} the <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> for the AFN transmitter described above. After 1963, it was only used as an aerial for the internal mobile radio service of the transmission facility. It was demolished in April, 2004 and replaced in the summer of 2004 with a 93 m high freestanding {{steel framework}} tower carrying aerials for directional services.|$|E
50|$|Two {{years later}} in 1933, the station moved its AM {{transmitter}} to Sandgate, and was operated from several locations including 72 Hunter Street, Newcastle until January 1937, when new studios and offices {{in the heart of}} Newcastle in the CML Building at 110 Hunter Street. In its time on the AM band, the station had its power increased twice, first to 2,000 watts, and then to 5,000 watts, using a <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|In {{occupied}} Europe the Nazis {{attempted to}} jam broadcasts {{to the continent}} from the BBC and other allied stations. Along with increasing transmitter power and adding extra frequencies, {{attempts were made to}} counteract the jamming by dropping leaflets over cities instructing listeners to construct a <b>directional</b> loop <b>aerial</b> that would enable them to hear the stations through the jamming. In the Netherlands such aerials were nicknamed [...] "moffenzeef" [...] (English: [...] "kraut sieve").|$|R
50|$|In 1973 a new TV {{tower was}} built on Brocken. This 123-meter, {{freestanding}} steel-tube tower stands on three legs,which hold shafts for cable and stairways for personnel access.Above the legs are three decks for <b>directional</b> radio transmission <b>aerials.</b> The new TV tower is not accessible to the public.|$|R
50|$|The radio {{technology}} behind direction finding was simple and well understood by both sides, but the technology commonly used {{before the war}} used a manually-rotated aerial to fix {{the direction of the}} transmitter. This was delicate work, took quite a time to accomplish to any degree of accuracy, and since it only revealed the line along which the transmission originated a single set could not determine if the transmission was from the true direction or its reciprocal 180 degrees in the opposite direction. Two sets were required to fix the position. Believing this to still be the case, German U-boat radio operators considered themselves fairly safe if they kept messages short. The British, however, developed an oscilloscope-based indicator which instantly fixed the direction and its reciprocal the moment a radio operator touched his Morse key. It worked simply with a crossed pair of conventional and fixed <b>directional</b> <b>aerials,</b> the oscilloscope display showing the relative received strength from each aerial as an elongated ellipse showing the line relative to the ship. The innovation was a 'sense' aerial which when switched in, suppressed the ellipse in the 'wrong' direction leaving only the correct bearing. With this there was hardly any need to triangulate—the escort could just run down the precise bearing provided and use radar for final positioning. Many U-boat attacks were suppressed and submarines sunk in this way—a good example of the great difference apparently minor aspects of technology could make to the battle.|$|R
50|$|The WCAT Radio Tower, at 135.7 m, is {{the tallest}} {{man-made}} structure in Vermont. It {{is located in}} Burlington, Vermont. It broadcasts at 5000 Watts. WCAT is the only radio station that has a radio tower within the city limits of Burlington. There is a second 109.0 m tower, also built in 1981, which is a <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> beside the WKDR Radio Tower. There is also a third tower on the site, which is 81.0 m tall.|$|E
5000|$|Game mechanics: Taking {{advantage}} of the systems {{that make up the}} gameplay. A game mechanics exploit is not a bug—it is working as designed, {{but at the same time}} is not working as intended. An example is the [...] "wavedash" [...] in Super Smash Bros. Melee, where the momentum gained from using a <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> dodge could be retained on landing; with proper timing this allows characters to use a stationary attack while sliding across the ground.|$|E
50|$|The <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> for 648 kHz (erected in 1981-82) {{consisted}} of a row of five 106.7 metre (350 ft) freestanding steel lattice towers of triangular cross section, insulated at their base. All five towers were driven. It was beamed at 131 degrees (i.e. south-east) though for practical purposes the exact bearing was nominal as the beam was very broad towards the east and south. It provided daytime coverage of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, north-east France and north-west Germany by ground wave propagation; and night-time coverage of much of Europe by skywave propagation.|$|E
50|$|After much {{procrastination}} on {{the part}} of various federal governments, FM broadcasting was eventually introduced in 1975. (There had been official experiments with FM broadcasting as far back as 1948.) Only a handful of radio stations were given new licences during the 1940s, 50s & 60s but, since 1975, many hundreds of new broadcasting licences have been issued on both the FM and AM bands. In the latter case, this was made possible by having 9 kHz between stations, rather 10 kHz breaks, as per the Geneva Frequency Plan. The installation of <b>directional</b> <b>aerials</b> also encouraged more AM stations. The type of station given FM licences reflects the policies and philosiphies of the various Australian governments. Initially, only the ABC and community radio stations were granted FM licences. However, after a change of government, commercial stations were permitted on the band, as from 1980. At first, one or two brand new stations were permitted in each major market. However, in 1990, one or two existing AM stations in each major market were given FM licences; the stations being chosen by an auction system. Apart from an initial settling-in period for those few stations transferred from AM to FM, there has been no simulcasting between AM and FM stations.In major cities, a number of brand new FM licences were issued in the 1990s and 2000s. All rural regions which traditionally had only one commercial station now have at least one AM and one FM commercial station. In many cases, the owner of the original station now has at least two outlets. The number of regional transmitters for the ABC's five networks also increased dramatically during this era.|$|R
5000|$|In 1948, a 110 m tall guyed steel {{framework}} mast {{was built on}} the site at [...] This served as a transmission aerial for the American Forces Network (AFN) until 1963. From 1963 until its demolition in November 1993, the mast was used as part of a <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> for a mediumwave transmitter. It also served as a spare FM transmitter with a butterfly aerial installed on top. The mast was demolished because it was in poor repair and was deemed no longer necessary. Plans for a new mast have not been realized.|$|E
50|$|It {{was part}} of an {{omnidirectional}} aerial, consisting of four 200-metre-high radio masts, which were connected using wires on their tops. The middle mast was fed via radio power. This very efficient transmission aerial led to interference with the Romanian transmitter Braşov on the same frequency, so only 70 kilowatts of power were used, instead of 250. But even with this reduced power, jamming of Braşov occurred, so in 1972 the radio facility Donebach was rebuilt as a <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> with a minimum towards Braşov. Therefore two radio masts were taken down and the remaining two were rebuilt as umbrella aerials. This made a transmission power of 250 kilowatts possible.|$|E
50|$|In 1935 the BBC {{started looking}} for {{transmitter}} sites to improve radio coverage in Devon, Dorset and Cornwall. After investigating 23 sites and carrying out extensive tests, two sites were selected: Start Point and Clevedon in Somerset. Start Point came on air on June 14, 1939 using an ST&C type C100 100 kW transmitter on 1050 kHz, and broadcast the West of England regional programme. A <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> array was used to avoid wasting power over the English Channel and to enhance the signal {{to the east and}} west. It consisted of two 137 m stayed lattice masts, one being a mast radiator and the other a parasitic reflector. Both masts had a break at 94.5 m to allow for the insertion of a loading coil.|$|E
50|$|Bodenseesender {{had been}} used since July 1, 2002 for the {{propagation}} of SWR Cont.Ra on the medium wave frequency 666 kHz. Until 1978 the aerial of the medium wave transmitter consisted of 4 guyed steel framework masts, which are insulated against ground. In the mid 1970s two of these masts were dismantled. One of them was rebuilt on a new site not far away from it earlier site in order to form {{with one of the}} two masts, which were not dismantled a <b>directional</b> <b>aerial,</b> while the other was rebuilt at Nierstein in Rhineland-Palatina. On the site of the latter mast a 240 metre high guyed steel framework mast was erected, which is also insulated against ground. At the construction of this mast, the length of the upper guys were chosen in such way, that there is no disturbation of its radiation pattern when grounded directly at the anchor blocks. So the upper guys do not have any intermediate insulators. They are only insulated toward the mast. However the guys of the lowest level are divided by one intermediate insulator electrically in two parts.|$|E
50|$|German beacons {{operated}} on the medium-frequency band and the signals involved a two-letter Morse identifier {{followed by a}} lengthy time-lapse which enabled the Luftwaffe crews to determine the signal's bearing. The Meacon system involved separate locations for a receiver with a <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> and a transmitter. The receipt of the German signal by the receiver was duly passed to the transmitter, the signal to be repeated. The action did not guarantee automatic success. If the German bomber flew closer to its own beam than the Meacon then the former signal would come through the stronger on the direction finder. The reverse would apply only if the meacon were closer. In general, German bombers were likely {{to get through to}} their targets without too much difficulty. It was to be some months before an effective night fighter force would be ready, and anti-aircraft defences only became adequate after the Blitz was over, so ruses were created to lure German bombers away from their targets. Throughout 1940, dummy airfields were prepared, good enough to stand up to skilled observation. An unknown number of bombs fell on these diversionary ("Starfish") targets.|$|E
5000|$|In 1989 URE {{started taking}} Capital Radio as its {{overnight}} [...] "sustaining" [...] service, when it couldn't provide output. This {{has been reported}} to be an innovative piece of programming. At the time Capital was by far the most dominant ILR station in the UK, with highly innovative programming. However, in North Essex, Capital was out of range except for people with a very expensive <b>directional</b> <b>aerial.</b> URE possessed this - and relayed Capital overnight, and for early breakfast until 8am: this considerably drove its listenership, although it took a knock in 1990 when URE's main competition, BBC Radio 1, started broadcasting in FM - previously BBC Radio 1 had been at 1053 & 1089 kHz AM, and for some students switching from FM to AM and back was too complicated, as other Medium Wave stations later also found. Ironically, to celebrate the launch of Radio 1 in FM, Radio 1 toured East Anglia by Helicopter and touched down at the Wivenhoe Park campus: alas, they did so {{in the middle of the}} Easter Holidays, and the only people to greet them were members of URE.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1988 the {{transmitter}} Wachenbrunn {{has also been}} {{the site of a}} medium wave transmitter of the Russian foreign radio service Voice of Russia (formerly Radio Moskau) on 1323 kHz. This transmitter is similar to {{the transmitter}} of [...] "MDR info" [...] run by Deutsche Telekom. In the afternoon and evening, a programme of the Voice of Russia was transmitted in German. With a power of 1000 kW, this transmitter was the third strongest in Germany. It used a <b>directional</b> <b>aerial</b> consisting of four 125.1 metre (407 feet) high guyed steeltube framework masts insulated against ground with triangular cross section. These masts, which were locally called the [...] "Russian Quartet", were located 800 metres (½ mile) away from the other parts of the facility, in order to avoid undesirable interference. For the transmission of the radio frequency power a cage line line from the transmitter, which was located close to the transmitter of [...] "MDR info" [...] and the [...] "Russian Quartet", was used until the modernisation of the facility in 2002-2003. In the course of the modernization, a completely transistorized transmitter with a power of 1,000 kilowatts was installed in an old store building close to the [...] "Russian Quartet". Therefore, the cage line was for its greatest parts obsolete and therefore shortened. By shortening the transmission line and installation of the new transmitter the efficiency was increased to 84%.|$|E
