25|$|Warsaw {{was another}} {{significant}} work by King from this period, a small sculpture whose inspiration comes from her {{response to the}} events in Europe. Having completed it, King <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never make another work like it.|$|E
500|$|Some fans {{attending}} the show were dissatisfied with its short length, with one quoted afterward as saying, [...] "That was so disappointing." [...] Some fans were also {{disappointed by the}} performance quality, with one quoted as saying, [...] "It looked like she lip-synched {{her way through the}} whole thing." [...] Other fans were more accommodating, pleased to be seeing her in good health and appearance and with one quoted as saying, [...] "Whatever, we love her. She's amazing." [...] One group of female fans wore matching pink tops that said [...] "Bald Ambition" [...] on one side and [...] "The Comeback 2007" [...] on the other. [...] Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel summed up some of the reaction by writing that fans {{at the tail end of}} the tour [...] "knew that the show would be short. ... They also <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be lip-synching, but this wasn't about music as much as it was about celebrity, loyalty and beating adversity." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Goodbye, Toby" [...] {{introduced}} Holly Flax, {{played by}} Amy Ryan, {{who would go}} on to become Michael's main love interest. In fact, her return to the series in the seventh season was used by the writers as a way to write Steve Carell out of the series after his contract ended. Ryan gained prominence with her role as Beadie Russell on the HBO series The Wire. The writers of The Office, who were fans of the series, then approached Ryan about appearing in their show. Ryan, feeling that a comedy series would [...] "keep [...] a couple steps ahead of people [...] surprise people" [...] agreed. Holly's character was developed by the writers awhile before the episode was scripted. However, once Ryan began acting on set, Lieberstein explained that [...] "we started to see this really silly side that Amy brought to the character, and [...] found almost like a junior Michael in her. And we all saw it and knew what we had." [...] After the filming of [...] "Goodbye, Toby", the writers were hoping that Ryan would return for the fifth season; the crew had not made a deal with her to film more episodes, but Lieberstein noted that [...] "we <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> stay around, or we hoped." [...] The episode also guest starred Melora Hardin, and Robert R. Shafer. The members of Darryl's band are the actual members of actor Craig Robinson's band: Chris Rob played bass, Asa Watkins played drums, and David Sampson played guitar.|$|E

6000|$|... "Bless ye, no! he don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have him. Ef it kem to that, he ain't {{even asked}} her! She wouldn't let him {{until she was}} sure of YOU." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{not beyond}} guessing, sir, at any rate," [...] I said. [...] "Colonel Herncastle knew my lady {{well enough to}} <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have refused to accept any legacy that came to her from HIM." ...|$|R

"She <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> weep {{again when}} she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long {{procession}} of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome." ...|$|E

50|$|A teacher, who is {{not happy}} with her job, pretends to be {{the ghost of a}} murder victim. Little did <b>she</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> meet the real ghost, the actual murderer and a heroine. She finds a man who chases her.|$|R
60|$|<b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{enjoy the}} little feast more {{if she had}} company while she ate it, for Rosa was a very social beast, Miss Belinda hung up the lantern, and, sitting down on an {{inverted}} bucket, watched her as she munched contentedly.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, {{we should}} only be too happy," [...] said the mother, and her daughter, from her inflection, <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be willing to defer her happiness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, not at all," [...] {{said the}} lady, but he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have said {{much the same}} if he had come as they were rising from table.|$|E
50|$|<b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{be moving}} to Eureka, California, in 2010, D.Stroir posted a Craigslist ad {{reaching}} out for someone to help her form a league.

5000|$|Clare Short, {{elected as}} a Labour MP from the 1983 general {{election}} onwards, resigned the Labour whip on 20 October 2006 and wished {{it to be}} <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> continue {{to sit in the}} Commons as an Independent Labour MP and a true [...] "Social Democrat".|$|R
5000|$|In late October 2007, Hughes made it <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be resigning {{from her}} {{position}} in the Bush White House.

60|$|The boy {{was much}} {{exercised}} over his mother. He <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be greatly worried over his prolonged absence. Never before had he remained {{away from home}} over night.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{neither did}} I think that: my niece, I felt sure, was safe from danger. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do {{nothing that would}} bring either her or me to shame." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{seemed so}} {{much less than}} calling on Mr. Peck that Annie looked out at Mrs. Munger's basket-phaeton at her gate, and <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> go with very little more urgence.|$|E
50|$|The {{woman at}} {{the centre of the}} case has {{occasionally}} spoken about her experiences, but not revealed her identity.

50|$|Because of the {{complete}} lack of cytosine due to the defective Alpha-cytosinase, DNA replication cannot occur. This means that any zygote with Acytosiosis {{will be unable to}} divide into multiple cells and will thus die. In most cases, the mother won't even <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have had a baby if it hadn't died from Acytosiosis.|$|R

50|$|In {{the final}} {{immunity}} challenge, Lillian beat Jon and Sandra {{to secure a}} space in the Final Tribal Council. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> likely lose for having already been voted out of the game, she chose to take Sandra to the end for she felt Sandra deserved the victory more than Jon.

50|$|The hulders {{were held}} to be kind to {{charcoal}} burners, watching their charcoal kilns while they rested. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> wake them {{if there were any}} problems, they were able to sleep, and in exchange they left provisions for her in a special place. A tale from Närke illustrates further how kind a hulder could be, especially if treated with respect (Hellström 1985:15).|$|R
60|$|Then she {{realised}} how {{she longed}} for a little rest, for perfect solitude, for perfect freedom to give herself over to the sweet torpor which paralysed her brain and limbs--tired, sleepy, or under the subtle influence of some mysterious agency--she did not know which she was; but <b>she</b> did <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have given everything she could at this moment for a few minutes' complete solitude.|$|R
