40|$|Fusarium wilts are {{widespread}} diseases affecting most agricultural crops. In {{absence of}} efficient alternatives, sowing resistant cultivars {{is the preferred}} approach to control this disease. However, actual resistance sources are often overcome by new pathogenic races, forcing breeders to continuously search for novel resistance sources. Selection of resistant accessions, mainly based on the evaluation of symptoms at timely intervals, is highly time-consuming. Thus, we tested the potential of an <b>infra-red</b> <b>imaging</b> system in plant breeding to speed up this process. For this, we monitored the changes in surface leaf temperature upon infection by F. oxysporum f. sp. pisi in several pea accessions with contrasting response to Fusarium wilt under a controlled environment. Using a portable <b>infra-red</b> <b>imaging</b> system we detected a significant temperature increase of at least 0. 5 °C after 10 days post-inoculation in the susceptible accessions, while the resistant accession temperature remained at control level. The increase in leaf temperature at 10 days post-inoculation {{was positively correlated with}} the AUDPC calculated over a 30 days period. Thus, this approach allowed the early discrimination between resistant and susceptible accessions. As such, applying <b>infra-red</b> <b>imaging</b> system in breeding for Fusarium wilt resistance would contribute to considerably shorten the process of selection of novel resistant sources. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The recent development of image-based phenotyping {{such as the}} evaluation of surface temperature by <b>infra-red</b> <b>imaging</b> system is revolutionizing agriculture and plant science. lnfra-red thermography is a non-contact, non-destructive and rapid technique which provides a temperature map of the targeted material or plant. Plant surface temperature is dependent on transpiration rate which is directly related with its physiological status. Thus it has been largely applied to monitor plant water status and to identify stressed plants. This approach was also successfully used to screen for drought or salinity tolerance. To determine whether infra-red thermography could also be useful for disease resistance breeding, we monitored surface leaf temperature of severa! pea accessions with contrasting response to Fusarium wilt, one of its major constraints. lnoculation with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. pisi induced a significant temperature increase of at least 0. 5 oc after 1 O days in the susceptible pea accessions, while the temperature of resistant accessions remained at control leve!.

40|$|This work investigates stellar {{mass loss}} in {{globular}} clusters. It comprises of optical and <b>infra-red</b> photometric <b>imaging</b> and spectroscopy, plus radio interferometry observations.

Much of this work is devoted to finding the threshold for dust production and the mass-loss rates from cluster stars with both chromospherically- and dust- or pulsation driven winds. Using very-high-resolution optical photometry, I have identified the transition between the two driving regimes as being at earlier spectral types than in solar-metallicity stars, suggesting that pulsation and continuum-driving become the dominant wind drivers at around K 5 ~M 3, or ~ 1500 L.

40|$|The polymer/nanoparticle {{interface}} of polyaniline (PANI) /TiO 2 composite {{was characterized}} by using Fourier transform <b>infra-red</b> spectrometer <b>imaging</b> system, Raman (both coupled with optical microscope) and UV-vis spectroscopy. During characterization, as white light from the optical microscope impinges on TiO 2, it absorbs supra band-gap photons and electron-hole pairs are produced. On accepting the holes, PANI gets oxidized from emeraldine salt form to its next oxidation state that is pernigraniline salt form, leading {{to a change in}} color. In optical micrographs this change in color appears as a halo around each TiO 2 particle and defines the extent of the oxidized area of PANI, which helps to characterize the extent of oxidation of PANI at the interface of PANI/TiO 2. Further studies revealed that the range and extent of oxidation at the interface in polymer depend on the types of dispersions of TiO 2 nanoparticles in PANI matrix. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

However, myocardial temperature is not monitored during operation. The aim of this study is then to find a relevant and simple method for myocardial global temperature estimation in real time using both ultrasounds and infra-red thermography. In order to quantify the sensitivity of ultrasonic velocity to temperature, a 2. 25 MHz ultrasonic probe was used for ex-vivo tests. Pig myocards (n= 25) were placed in a thermostatically-controlled water bath and measurements of the ultrasound velocity were realized from 10 to 30 ˚C. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the specificity and sensitivity of the ultrasonic echo delay induced by the modification of temperature can be exploited for in-depth thermometry. In parallel, for TIR experiments, a bolometer was used to detect the myocardium surface thermal evolution during in-vivo pig heart experiments.
