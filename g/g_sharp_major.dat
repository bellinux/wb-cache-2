5000|$|Despite the marking [...] "very slow", {{the third}} {{movement}} has numerous changes of tempo. The viola introduces the first theme, {{which the first}} violin then repeats. There are strong thematic links with the first movement, and, in defiance of orthodox rules of harmony, conspicuous use of consecutive fifths. The music is rhapsodic and lyrical; it begins and ends in <b>G</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>major.</b> with passages in A minor and D minor.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{is written}} in the key of E major. [...] "Change the World" [...] begins with an intro, which {{features}} a chord progression of E7, E major, E6, E7, E6 and E major chords, played around the E-based bass line, which later turns into a E major, F-sharp minor and G major bass line. The intro {{is followed by the}} first verse, which is accompanied by the intro chord progression and a A major, A6, A7, A7, A6 and A major chord progression for the B-section of the verse. After the E-major chord progression, including 6th and 7th chords was played again, it ends with a G#7 chord, leading to the C-section of every verse, consisting of an F#m7, G#7, C#m, G#m7Sus4/A bass, G#7, C#m, G#m7 Sus4/A bass, G#7, C#m7, Cm7, Bm7, A, E/G#, G#m, Gm, F#m, ending to the E major chord. The first verse is followed by an interlude, which is identical to the first intro line. The accompaniment to the second verse and second chorus is identical to the ones before. A link is added with the lyric [...] "Baby, if I could change the world", followed by Clapton's guitar solo, in which he played {{with the help of the}} E minor blues scale, ending his solo with the <b>G</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>major</b> pentatonic scale. After the solo, the chorus is repeated, now starting with the line [...] "If I could change the world...", leading to the second link, which is repeated three times, before the song's outro, which is identical to the songs intro and interlude.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{studies the}} Uppsala University Li- brary Manuscript Imhs 20 : 13, a four-folio lute {{manuscript}} for a thirteen-course baroque lute containing two suites – in D sharp minor and <b>G</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>major</b> respectively – and an intabulation of an Affettuoso del Sig re Chelleri. The paper falls into four major parts. The first chapter presents the manuscript and summarizes {{what has been}} written about it in the literature preceding this paper, including RISM. The watermark is treated in order to confirm or rebut the RISM dating, as well the datings proposed by e. g. Sparr and Rudén. The second chapter treats the suites, and surveys their harmonic, melodic and rhythmic treatments as well as usage of ornament signs. A reference material of post- 1720 lute composers is compared to the suites as to usage of ornament signs, handwriting, suite compiling and other stylistic traits. This is done in order to place the MS in its contextual scene concerning musical style, technical complexity and also hints at compositional affinities with some of the composers in the reference material. The third chapter describes the Affettuoso, the musical style of which differs to a large degree from that of the suites. The music per se is analysed concerning style, {{as was the case with}} the suites in chapter two. The composer Chelleri is presented in general, and his connection to Sweden in particular. The Affettuoso exists in nine versions in Sweden, all of which have been put in juxtaposition with the Imhs 20 : 13 version in order to place the MS in time and place. One of the concordances is associated with a specific person – Carl Leuhusen – whom is briefly accounted for. Invariances be- tween Imhs 20 : 13 and some of the concordances concerning musical realization suggest a dating for the former. The lack of preserved versions of the Affettuoso in countries other than Sweden suggests a Swedish origin for Imhs 20 : 13. The fourth chapter views all other Swedish lute MSS with 18 th century dating, in order to detect similarities. A general search for mid- 18 th century Swedish lutenists has revealed the names of three musicians: David Kellner, Carl Gustav von Düben and Christian Ludvig Kuhlau are described and examined as potential authors of 20 : 13. The muscial appendix includes a facsimile of UUB Imhs 20 : 13, a keyboard transcription of the said MS as well as edited versions of all the concordances of the Affettuoso...|$|E
