"Moreover, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> {{attribute}} {{them all}} {{to the neglect of}} viscosity is an unwarranted oversimplification The root lies deeper, in lack of precisely that deductive rigor whose importance is so commonly minimized by physicists and engineers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2004, Putin said: [...] "It is my deep {{conviction}} that {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union was a national tragedy on a massive scale. I think the ordinary citizens of the former Soviet Union and the citizens in the post-Soviet space, the CIS countries, have gained nothing from it. On the contrary, people have been faced with a host of problems." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Incidentally, at that period, too, opinions varied, including among the leaders of the Union republics. For example, Nursultan Nazarbayev was categorically opposed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and he said so openly proposing various formulas for preserving the state within the common borders. But, I repeat, all that is in the past. Today we should look at the situation in which we live. One cannot keep looking back and fretting about it: we should look forward." [...] In December 2007, he said in the interview to the Time magazine: [...] "Russia is an ancient country with historical, profound traditions and a very powerful moral foundation. And this foundation is a love for the Motherland and patriotism. Patriotism in the best sense of that word. Incidentally, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> a certain extent, to a significant extent, this is also attributable to the American people." ...|$|E

[...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> live and prosper is good fortune, and {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> die and sleep is good fortune, for in sleep there is neither hunger nor thirst of body or of spirit. In sleep there come no cares; in sleep ambitions are at rest; nor do those who look no more upon the sun smart beneath the treacheries of false women or false friends. Should the battle turn against me, Macumazahn, {{at least that}} good fortune will be mine, for never will I live to be crushed beneath Cetewayo's heel." ...|$|E

She has shown herself a very fast boat the few times she has been raced, but so have we, and taking the line through boats that we have both sailed against, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we ought <b>to</b> be able to beat her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well {{thought of}} Noma," [...] said Hafela. [...] "Hokosa told us {{last night that}} to him had passed {{the wisdom of the}} Messenger; but if this be so, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> you has passed the guile of Hokosa." ...|$|E
60|$|Nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> {{keep the}} peace at the polls, and to prevent the {{persistently}} disloyal from voting, constitutes just cause of offense to Maryland.

But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> him it has been a continual sorrow." ...|$|E
5000|$|She {{turned down}} a seven-year Hollywood {{contract}}, saying that while the payment would have been great, [...] "the contract was a whole book. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> even <b>to</b> go to the toilet I would have needed a permission." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In addition," [...] said Miss Winter, [...] "she is {{at every}} spare moment busy with Latin and Greek, and <b>I</b> cannot <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> {{keep pace with}} a boy of Norman's age and ability can be {{desirable}} for her." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He will arrive," [...] {{she replied}} confidently. [...] "Have {{no fear of}} that. There are others to whom {{accidents}} and adventures might happen, but not, I think, to Mr. Samuel Weatherley. I am sorry that you are bothered, though, Mr. Chetwode. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> console you I shall wear one of my two new muslin gowns which have just arrived from Paris." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> be strong, {{and able}} to whop everybody--(not to do it, mind you, but to feel that {{you were able to}} do it,)--would be the {{greatest}} of all gifts. There is a serene good humor which plays about George Champion's broad face, which shows the consciousness of this power, and lights up his honest blue eyes with a magnanimous calm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor {{does she}} know it; at least, I presume not. But you should know it now. And, Frank, I will tell it you; not to turn you from her--not with that object, though <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> a certain extent, it should have that effect. Mary's birth was not such as would become your wife and be {{beneficial}} to your children." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> up <b>to</b> <b>that</b> moment I {{had never}} {{experienced}} such a thrill as passed through me when I realized that I was navigating these historic waters.

6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] she {{answered}} reflectively. [...] "I can shoot {{very well with}} a rifle, for my father has taught me, but I never would shoot at living things unless I must because I was hungry, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> kill is cruel. But, of course, it is different with men," [...] she added hastily, [...] "and no doubt {{you will be a}} great hunter one day, Allan Quatermain, since you can already aim so well." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{appetite}} {{at breakfast}} was {{not affected by}} my ignorance of the facts, motives, events and conclusions. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> understand everything {{is not good for}} the intellect. A well-stocked intelligence weakens the impulse to action; an overstocked one leads gently to idiocy. But Mrs Fyne's individualist woman-doctrine, naively unscrupulous, flitted through my mind. The salad of unprincipled notions she put into these girl-friends' heads! Good innocent creature, worthy wife, excellent mother (of the strict governess type), she was as guileless of consequences as any determinist philosopher ever was.|$|E
60|$|The whole {{trend of}} my thought {{in matters of}} conduct is against {{whatever}} accentuates one's individual separation from the collective consciousness. It follows naturally from my fundamental creed that avoidable silences and secrecy are sins, just as abstinences are in themselves sins rather than virtues. And so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> leave any organization or human association except for a wider and larger association, to detach oneself {{in order to go}} alone, or to go apart narrowly with just a few, is fragmentation and sin. Even if one disagrees with the professions or formulae or usages of an association, one should be sure that the disagreement is sufficiently profound to justify one's secession, and in any case of doubt, one should remain. I count schism a graver sin than heresy.|$|E

60|$|It is a fact, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> many minds {{the mere}} wildness {{represented}} by {{the voice of a}} great wild bird in his lonely haunts is so grateful, that the sound itself, whatever its quality may be, delights, and is more than the most beautiful music. A certain distinguished man of letters and Church dignitary was once asked, a friend tells me, why he lived away from society, buried in the loneliest village on the dreary East coast; at that spot where, standing on the flat desolate shore you look over the North Sea, and have no land between you and far Spitzbergen. He answered, that he made his home there {{because it was the only}} spot in England in which, sitting in his own room, he could listen to the cry of the pink-footed goose. Only those who have lost their souls will fail to understand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now we {{will take}} a ride over the ground, and I will show you what that is like. Of course it will give you more trouble {{clearing}} away the forest than it would do if you settled upon land without trees upon it. But forest land is generally the best when it is cleared; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> people like your father and mother land like this is much preferable, as in making the clearings, clumps and belts of trees can be left, giving a home-like appearance to the place. Of course upon bare land you can plant trees, but it is a long time before these grow to a sufficient size to give a character to a homestead. Besides, as I told you, there are already several other natural clearings upon the ground, enough to afford grass for quite as many animals as you will probably start with." ...|$|E
6000|$|Color, without form, is less {{frequently}} obtainable, {{and it may}} be doubted whether it be desirable: yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> the full enjoyment of it, a certain abandonment of form is necessary; sometimes by reducing it to the shapeless glitter of the gem, as often Tintoret and Bassano; sometimes by loss of outline and blending of parts, as Turner; sometimes by flatness of mass, as often Giorgione and Titian. How far it is possible for the painter to represent those mountains of Shelley as the poet sees them, [...] "mingling their flames with twilight," [...] I cannot say; but my impression is, that there is no true abstract mode of considering color; and that all the loss of form in the works of Titian or Turner, is not ideal, but the representation of the natural conditions under which bright color is seen; for form is always in a measure lost by nature herself when color is very vivid.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s he chaired the radio comedy show The News Quiz, {{returning}} to the show in 1996 for another ten years. In March 2006, Hoggart presented his last edition of The News Quiz commenting: [...] "I'm getting a bit clapped out and jaded, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> beginning <b>to</b> show." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly know. Perhaps {{they would}} hardly do <b>that.</b> However, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we ought <b>to</b> make it legal now--as {{soon as you}} are able to go out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{you ought}} <b>to</b> be {{concerned}} about Stuyvesant," [...] said Phonny, [...] "for he is as sage and demure as any man I ever saw." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Colonel Cochrane, {{crossing}} {{his legs}} and leaning forward with the decision {{of a man who}} has definite opinions, [...] "I don't at all agree with you, Brown, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> advocate such a course is to take a very limited view of our national duties. I think that behind national interests and diplomacy and all that there lies a great guiding force,--a Providence, in fact,--which is for ever getting the best out of each nation and using it for the good of the whole. When a nation ceases to respond, it is time that she went into hospital for a few centuries, like Spain or Greece,--the virtue has gone out of her. A man or a nation is not here upon this earth merely to do what is pleasant and profitable. It is often called upon to carry out what is unpleasant and unprofitable; but if it is obviously right, it is mere shirking not to undertake it." ...|$|E
60|$|Here {{therefore}} we may see, that even prayer, {{as well as}} other acts of religious worship, may be performed in great hypocrisy; although <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> perform prayer in hypocrisy, {{is one of the most}} daring sins that are committed by the sons of men. For by prayer, above all duties, is our most direct and immediate personal approach into the presence of God; as there is an uttering of things before him, especially a giving to him of thanks for things received, or a begging that such and such things might be bestowed upon me. But now, to do these things in hypocrisy (and it is easy to do them so, when we go up into the temple to pray), must needs be intolerable wickedness, and it argueth infinite patience in God, that he should let such as do so arise alive from their knees, or that he should suffer them to go away from the place where they stand, without some token or mark of his wrath upon them.|$|E
60|$|Marie Melmotte, {{as she had}} promised, sat up all night, as did {{also the}} {{faithful}} Didon. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> Marie the night was full of pleasure,-- or at any rate of pleasurable excitement. With her door locked, she packed and unpacked and repacked her treasures,--having more than once {{laid out on the}} bed the dress in which she purposed to be married. She asked Didon her opinion whether that American clergyman of whom they had heard would marry them on board, and whether in that event the dress would be fit for the occasion. Didon thought that the man, if sufficiently paid, would marry them, and that the dress would not much signify. She scolded her young mistress very often during the night for what she called nonsense; but was true to her, and worked hard for her. They determined to go without food in the morning, so that no suspicion should be raised by the use of cups and plates. They could get refreshment at the railway-station.|$|E
6000|$|... "Respect?" [...] he repeated, in {{the same}} vague way. [...] "No, I should {{n't care about that}} unless it was {{included}} in the other. But you know whether I have accused you of anything, or whether I have insulted you. I won't excuse myself. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> ought <b>to</b> be insulting to your common sense." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{it comes}} off," [...] the Ambassador said, [...] "I {{am going to}} talk to the Duchess and Miss Morse. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> give you away." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> going <b>to</b> bed {{was one of}} {{the luckiest}} ideas I have ever had in an emergency.

But there, locked in and secure from all interruptions, <b>I</b> could <b>think</b> out the {{position}} in all its bearings and make my arrangements at leisure.|$|R
