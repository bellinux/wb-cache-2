25|$|The <b>guaifenesin</b> {{developed}} by Eldon Boyd is still commonly used today as an expectorant, sold over the counter, and usually taken by mouth {{to assist the}} bringing up of phlegm from the airways in acute respiratory tract infections. <b>Guaifenesin</b> is a component of Mucinex, Robitussin DAC, Cheratussin DAC, Robitussin AC, Cheratussin AC, Benylin, DayQuil Mucous Control, Meltus, and Bidex 400.|$|E
25|$|The salts {{pseudoephedrine}} hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine sulfate {{are found}} in many over-the-counter preparations, either as a single ingredient or (more commonly) in combination with antihistamines, <b>guaifenesin,</b> dextromethorphan, and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen) or an NSAID (such as aspirin or ibuprofen).|$|E
25|$|Investigational {{medications}} include cannabinoids and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist tropisetron. Low quality evidence {{found an}} improvement in symptoms with a gluten free diet among those without celiac disease. A controlled study of <b>guaifenesin</b> failed to demonstrate any benefits from this treatment.|$|E
25|$|Preparations of codeine in Iran {{normally}} {{comes with}} paracetamol or <b>guaifenesin,</b> {{and can be}} purchased over-the-counter. Pure codeine is also available as codeine phosphate 30mg tablets and special permit required to purchasing. Iran's deputy health minister reported that codeine combinations is Iran's best selling OTC medication.|$|E
25|$|Misuse of multi-symptom cold medications, {{rather than}} using a cough {{suppressant}} whose sole active ingredient is dextromethorphan, carries significant risk of fatality or serious illness. Multi-symptom cold medicines contain other active ingredients, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), chlorpheniramine, and phenylephrine, any of which can cause permanent bodily damage such as kidney failure, or even death, if taken on the generally accepted recreational dosing scale of dextromethorphan. Sorbitol, an artificial sweetener found in many cough syrups containing dextromethorphan, can also have negative side effects including diarrhea and nausea when taken at recreational dosages of dextromethorphan. <b>Guaifenesin,</b> an expectorant commonly accompanying dextromethorphan in cough preparations, can cause unpleasant symptoms including vomiting, nausea, kidney stones, and headache.|$|E
500|$|While other {{treatments}} for croup have been studied, none have sufficient {{evidence to support}} their use. Inhalation of hot steam or humidified air is a traditional self-care treatment, but clinical studies have failed to show effectiveness and currently it is rarely used. The use of cough medicines, which usually contain dextromethorphan or <b>guaifenesin,</b> are also discouraged. While breathing heliox (a mixture of helium and oxygen) to decrease the work of breathing {{has been used in}} the past, there is very little evidence to support its use. [...] Since croup is usually a viral disease, antibiotics are not used unless secondary bacterial infection is suspected. In cases of possible secondary bacterial infection, the antibiotics vancomycin and cefotaxime are recommended. In severe cases associated with influenzaA or B, the antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors may be administered.|$|E
2500|$|Fertile {{cervical}} mucus {{is important in}} creating an environment that allows sperm {{to pass through the}} cervix and into the fallopian tubes where they wait for ovulation. [...] Fertility charts can help diagnose hostile {{cervical mucus}}, a common cause of infertility. If this condition is diagnosed, some sources suggest taking <b>guaifenesin</b> in the few days before ovulation to thin out the mucus.|$|E
2500|$|In {{veterinary}} anesthesia, ketamine {{is often}} used for its anesthetic and analgesic effects on cats, dogs, rabbits, rats, and other small animals. It is highly used in induction and anesthetic maintenance in horses. It {{is an important part}} of the [...] "rodent cocktail", a mixture of drugs used for anesthetizing rodents. Veterinarians often use ketamine with sedative drugs to produce balanced anesthesia and analgesia, and as a constant-rate infusion to help prevent pain wind-up. Ketamine is used to manage pain among large animals, though it has less effect on bovines. It is the primary intravenous anesthetic agent used in equine surgery, often in conjunction with detomidine and thiopental, or sometimes <b>guaifenesin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{is commonly}} used in animals for major surgery. Animals are often premedicated intravenously or intramuscularly with a sedative, analgesic, and anticholinergic agent (dogs frequently receive buprenorphine, acepromazine, and glycopyrrolate). The next step is induction, usually with an intravenous drug. [...] Dogs and cats commonly receive thiopental (no longer allowed in the UK), ketamine with diazepam, tiletamine with zolazepam (usually just in cats), and/or propofol. Alfaxalone is a steroid anaesthetic used in many practices in the UK to induce anaesthesia in cats and sometimes dogs. It is similar in physiological effect but different in composition to the now withdrawn Saffan. [...] Horses commonly receive thiopental and <b>guaifenesin.</b> [...] Following induction, the animal is intubated with an endotracheal tube and maintained on a gas anesthetic. [...] The most common gas anesthetics in use in veterinary medicine are isoflurane, enflurane, and halothane, although desflurane and sevoflurane are becoming more popular due to rapid induction and recovery.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{anesthetic}} agents used {{in human}} medicine {{are used in}} veterinary medicine. [...] Alpha-2 receptor agonist drugs such as xylazine, romifidine, detomidine, and medetomidine, are used frequently in veterinary species (particularly large animal), but are rarely used in people. [...] <b>Guaifenesin</b> {{is used as a}} muscle relaxant prior to anesthesia induction in some animals. [...] Propofol is commonly used in small animal anesthesia, however it is rarely used in large animals due to the cost. 'Propoclear' is also commonly used in smaller branches of small animal surgery as it has a longer shelf life once opened than propofol whilst essentially having the same properties. [...] Butorphanol is rarely used in people but is commonly used in all species. [...] Ketamine, used in children for anesthesia, is used extensively in many species to induce anesthesia or cause heavy sedation. [...] Expensive agents, such as etomidate and desflurane are rarely used outside of university hospitals. [...] Different species have different responses to drugs. [...] For example, horses may experience mania with morphine whereas dogs typically become sedated. [...] Rabbits and guinea pigs are well sedated with midazolam, which can occasionally excite dogs and cats.|$|E
50|$|Guaifenesin's {{neurological}} properties {{first became}} {{known in the}} late 1940s. <b>Guaifenesin</b> is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used routinely in large-animal veterinary surgery. <b>Guaifenesin</b> is used in combination with, for example, propofol, since <b>guaifenesin</b> does not produce analgesia nor does it produce unconsciousness.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guaifenesin</b> {{increases}} the analgesic effect of paracetamol (acetaminophen) and aspirin, {{increases the}} sedative effects of alcohol, tranquilisers, sleep-pills and total anesthetics. <b>Guaifenesin</b> increases {{the effects of}} medication that decrease muscle tone.|$|E
50|$|The <b>guaifenesin</b> {{protocol}} was studied, {{as a method}} to treat fibromyalgia, although a one-year double-blinded {{study found that the}} treatment performs no better than placebo. <b>Guaifenesin</b> is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of fibromyalgia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guaifenesin</b> is sold as pills or syrups under many brand names. Single-ingredient {{formulations}} of <b>guaifenesin</b> are available, {{and it is}} also included in many other over-the-counter cough and cold remedy combinations (usually in conjunction with dextromethorphan, paracetamol (acetaminophen), ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylephrine).|$|E
50|$|Methocarbamol is the {{carbamate}} of <b>guaifenesin,</b> {{but does}} not produce <b>guaifenesin</b> as a metabolite, because the carbamate bond is not hydrolyzed metabolically; metabolism is by Phase I ring hydroxylation and O-demethylation, followed by Phase II conjugation. All the major metabolites are unhydrolyzed carbamates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guaifenesin</b> {{protocol}} is an unapproved {{treatment for}} fibromyalgia {{suggested in the}} 1990s by R. Paul St. Amand. The protocol involves three parts: titrating the <b>guaifenesin</b> dosage, avoiding salicylates, and following a low-carbohydrate diet if the patient is hypoglycemic. <b>Guaifenesin</b> has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for the treatment of fibromyalgia, and the protocol has not been shown to be effective in clinical trials. Despite the lack of clinical efficacy, the protocol has been adopted by many due to anecdotal evidence of success.|$|E
5000|$|Side-effects of <b>guaifenesin</b> include nausea, vomiting, {{formation}} of kidney stones, diarrhea, and constipation. [...] Nausea and vomiting {{can be reduced}} by taking <b>guaifenesin</b> with meals. [...] The risk of forming kidney stones during prolonged use can be reduced by maintaining good hydration and increasing the pH of urine. Rarely, severe allergic reactions may occur, including a rash or swelling of the lips or face, which may require urgent medical assistance. Mild dry mouth or chapped lips may also occur when taking this medication. Drinking {{a glass of water}} is recommended with each dose of <b>guaifenesin.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{widely used}} {{derivative}} drug is the expectorant known as <b>guaifenesin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} was discovered serendipitously when the physician found that uricosuric drugs for treating gout also coincided with relief of fibromyalgia symptoms. <b>Guaifenesin</b> is mildly uricosuric but, unlike standard uricosuric drugs, has almost no side-effects. St. Amand therefore {{began to study}} whether <b>guaifenesin</b> might relieve the symptoms of fibromyalgia while causing fewer side-effects than the earlier medications.|$|E
50|$|The <b>guaifenesin</b> {{developed}} by Eldon Boyd is still commonly used today as an expectorant, sold over the counter, and usually taken by mouth {{to assist the}} bringing up of phlegm from the airways in acute respiratory tract infections. <b>Guaifenesin</b> is a component of Mucinex, Robitussin DAC, Cheratussin DAC, Robitussin AC, Cheratussin AC, Benylin, DayQuil Mucous Control, Meltus, and Bidex 400.|$|E

50|$|Expectorants are {{substances}} {{claimed to}} make coughing easier while enhancing {{the production of}} mucus and phlegm. Two examples are acetylcysteine and <b>guaifenesin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Guaifenesin</b> is used {{to control}} cough and is {{sometimes}} combined with dextromethorphan, an antitussive, such as in Mucinex DM or Robitussin DM.|$|E
50|$|Paracetamol is {{sometimes}} combined with phenylephrine hydrochloride. Sometimes a third active ingredient, such as ascorbic acid, caffeine, chlorpheniramine maleate, or <b>guaifenesin</b> {{is added to}} this combination.|$|E
50|$|Vicks 44E Pediatric (or 44E) is an oral {{combination}} therapy for breathing difficulties. Active ingredients are dextromethorphan and <b>guaifenesin</b> a cough suppressant and an expectorant, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Combination <b>guaifenesin</b> and {{pseudoephedrine}} is {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Mucinex D, in which [...] "D" [...] refers {{to the presence of}} pseudoephedrine, which is a [...] "decongestant." ...|$|E
50|$|Methocarbamol, {{sold under}} the trade name Robaxin, is a muscle relaxant {{commonly}} used in horses to treat muscle pain secondary to spasticity, tetanus, or tying-up. Both oral and injectable forms are on the market. Its use is regulated by many equine competitive governing bodies, since it {{is thought to have}} a CNS depressant effect and produces the metabolite <b>guaifenesin,</b> which is a pre-anesthetic veterinary drug. <b>Guaifenesin</b> has been found in the plasma of horses receiving oral, but not intravenous, methocarbamol, likely due to the high first-pass effect of the drug.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Guaifenesin</b> {{was first}} {{approved}} by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1952. Although previously deemed [...] "Generally Regarded as Safe" [...] in its original approval, the drug received a New Drug Application for the extended-release version, which won approval on July 12, 2002. Because of this, the FDA then issued letters to other manufacturers of timed-release <b>guaifenesin</b> to stop marketing their unapproved versions, leaving Adams Respiratory Therapeutics {{in control of the}} market. Adams was subsequently acquired by Reckitt Benckiser, based on the strength of the marketing generated by Adams' Mucinex brand.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guaifenesin</b> was {{studied as}} a method to improve the {{possibility}} of conception, by thinning and increasing the stretchability (improved spinnbarkeit) of the cervical mucus, during the few days before ovulation, thus facilitating sperm penetration.|$|E
