Method. The participants consisted of children aged 8 – 13, who, based on screening were labelled as high-anxious (n= 172) or median-anxious (n = 72). The high-anxious children {{were randomly assigned to}} a child-focused, parent-focused or non-intervention group. The Family System Test (FAST), a spatial placement technique, was used to determine cohesion, hierarchy and family structure of the participants, at pre-test and at 1 - and 2 -year follow-ups. Results. (1) Family <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> high-anxious children receiving an intervention did not improve more, than family <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> high-anxious children receiving no intervention; (2) Family <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> high-anxious children receiving a parent-focused intervention did not improve more, than family <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> high-anxious children receiving a child-focused intervention; (3) Family <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> median-anxious children was not better at all measurements, than family <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> high-anxious children...|$|R

5|$|Bioluminescence {{has several}} {{functions}} in different taxa. Haddock et al. (2010) list as {{more or less}} definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyse the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves. In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves. The following functions are reasonably well established in the named organisms.|$|E
