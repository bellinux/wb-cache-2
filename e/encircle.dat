5|$|A battle {{certainly}} ensued {{although there}} are naturally two accounts as to what actually took place. According to the Burmese chronicles, the Burmese command fielded an army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza, the Viceroy of Prome, as a decoy and the two armies lurked on the flanks in order to <b>encircle</b> any overstretched Siamese forces. As planned, the Siamese vanguard troops pressed on Thado Dhamma Yaza's army, allowing Bayinnaung's army waiting on the left flank to <b>encircle</b> the Siamese forces, which subsequently were wiped out. Tabinshwehti's army on the right flank drove back the remaining Siamese forces into the city.|$|E

Furthermore, they may <b>encircle</b> their arms with a {{depiction of the}} circlet (a red circle bearing the motto) with the badge pendant thereto and the collar; the former is shown either outside or {{on top of the}} latter.|$|E
5|$|The enemy {{made many}} {{attempts}} to <b>encircle</b> the regiment, {{but each time}} they failed because of the many casualties inflicted by the 65th. Because the 65th held their positions, that enabled the U.S. Marines {{to withdraw from the}} Chosin Reservoir on December 1950.|$|E

2500|$|The {{signature}} {{is usually}} {{followed by a}} doubly <b>encircled</b> JBV (J are joined). Early on, it was doubly <b>encircled</b> JBV. The labels at [...] "Rue Croix Petits Champs" [...] began using the doubly <b>encircled</b> JBV (J joined), which remained the same on [...] "3. rue Demours-Ternes" [...] labels. [...] In addition, most specimens have a number associated with them.|$|R

5|$|The fight {{continued}} into the evening, and after dark the 1st Battalion disengaged and withdrew through the 2nd Battalion immediately behind it. Both Check and the regimental commander, Michaelis, expected the North Koreans to <b>encircle</b> the 1st Battalion position during the night if it stayed where it was.|$|E
5|$|With the Soviet forces cut in half, {{the attack}} on the Karelian Isthmus could commence. The Finnish army {{attempted}} to <b>encircle</b> large Soviet formations at Sortavala and Hiitola by advancing to the western shores of Lake-Ladoga. By mid-August the encirclement succeeded and both towns were taken but many Soviet formations were able to evacuate by sea. Further west, {{the attack on}} Viborg was launched. With Soviet resistance breaking down, the Finns were able to <b>encircle</b> Vyborg by advancing to the Vuoksi River. The city itself was taken on 30 August, along with a broad advance {{on the rest of the}} Karelian Isthmus. By the beginning of September, Finland had restored its pre-winter war borders.|$|E
5|$|Caribbean sponges of {{the genus}} Aplysina suffer from Aplysina red band syndrome. This causes Aplysina to develop one or more rust-colored bands, {{sometimes}} with adjacent bands of necrotic tissue. These lesions may completely <b>encircle</b> branches of the sponge. The disease appears to be contagious and impacts approximately 10 percent of A. cauliformis on Bahamian reefs. The rust-colored bands are caused by a cyanobacterium, but it is unknown whether this organism actually causes the disease.|$|E
50|$|The fascia lata {{surrounds}} the tensor fasciae latae muscle. It is a fibrous sheath that <b>encircles</b> the thigh subcutaneously. This <b>encircling</b> {{of the muscle}} allows the muscles to be bound together tightly.|$|R
5000|$|The {{danger to}} the <b>encircling</b> force is that it is, itself, cut off from its {{logistical}} base; if the <b>encircled</b> force is able to stand firm, or maintain a supply route, the <b>encircling</b> force can be thrown into confusion (for example, Rommel's [...] "Dash to the Wire" [...] in 1941 and the Demyansk Pocket in 1942) or be comprehensively destroyed (as during the Burma campaign, in 1944).|$|R
25|$|The Soviets {{deployed}} three brigades with armor {{support to}} open the road connections to the <b>encircled</b> divisions but Finnish efforts prevented them. Renewed attacks distracted the Finns enough to allow the <b>encircled</b> Soviet forces to escape through the dense forests by abandoning their heavy equipment. Given {{the element of surprise}} and due to the superior numbers of the Soviets, the Finnish troops guarding the <b>encircled</b> divisions had little hope of containing organized breakouts, especially in the forests, and so many of the <b>encircled</b> Soviets managed to escape to their own side with the last escaping on August 10.|$|R
5|$|Hannibal {{intended}} {{that his}} cavalry, comprising mainly medium Hispanic cavalry and Numidian light horse, and positioned on the flanks, would defeat the weaker Roman cavalry and swing around {{to attack the}} Roman infantry from the rear as it pressed upon Hannibal's weakened center. His veteran African troops would then press in from the flanks at the crucial moment, and <b>encircle</b> the overextended Romans.|$|E
5|$|In early November, Vandegrift, {{fearing that}} the Japanese were {{planning}} {{an assault on}} the Lunga perimeter from the east using Shōji's forces plus additional reinforcements, launched an operation against the Japanese units at Koli Point. Beginning on 4 November, two battalions of U.S. Marines and two battalions of U.S. Army troops attacked and attempted to <b>encircle</b> Shōji's men at Gavaga Creek near the village of Tetere in the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|In the engagement, the U.S. forces {{attempted}} to <b>encircle</b> and destroy Shōji's forces. Although Shōji's unit took heavy casualties, he {{and most of}} his men were able to evade the encirclement attempt and escape into the interior of Guadalcanal. As Shōji's troops endeavored to reach Japanese positions {{in another part of the}} island, they were pursued and attacked by a battalion-sized patrol of U.S. Marine Raiders.|$|E

40|$|The {{migration}} of an <b>encircling</b> silicone band through a rectus muscle {{is a rare}} postoperative complication associated with scleral buckling surgery for retinal detachment. In this present study, we describe what {{we believe to be}} the first reported case of a patient who experienced postoperative {{migration of}} an <b>encircling</b> silicone band through the rectus muscle, despite the band being surgically secured to the sclera in a scleral tunnel. A 58 -year-old man presented with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in his left eye. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed with the placement of an <b>encircling</b> silicone band, and the patient’s retina was successfully reattached. One year postoperatively, the <b>encircling</b> band became exposed on the nasal side of the conjunctiva next to the limbus without any symptoms. Two weeks later, the exposed <b>encircling</b> band was surgically removed without any complications. The findings of this study show that even when an <b>encircling</b> silicone band is surgically secured around the eye, periodic and careful postoperative follow-up examinations should be performed to ensure no migration of the band...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Heraclius had {{concentrated}} a large army at Antioch to {{roll back}} Syria. Khalid got the news from Roman prisoners in Northern Syria. After his past experiences Heraclius had been avoiding pitched battles with the Muslims. He planned to isolate the Muslim corps from each other, and separately <b>encircle</b> and destroy the Muslim armies. Five massive armies were launched in Syria from different routes in June 636 to recapture it.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April the Red Army {{started the}} Battle of Berlin and by 19 April {{they started to}} <b>encircle</b> the city. On 20 April, his 56th birthday, Hitler made his last trip to the surface.

5|$|Some sources {{state that}} in {{contrast}} to the glans penis, the clitoral glans lacks smooth muscle within its fibrovascular cap and is thus differentiated from the erectile tissues of the clitoris and bulbs; additionally, bulb size varies and may be dependent on age and estrogenization. Though the bulbs are considered the equivalent of the male spongiosum, they do not completely <b>encircle</b> the urethra.|$|E
5|$|The 27th Regiment became {{locked in}} fierce {{fighting}} with the Partisan 27th East Bosnia Division and 38th Bosnia Division, which had launched an offensive near Vlasenica. The inability of the 27th Regiment to push forward meant that the plan to <b>encircle</b> the Partisan force was not achieved and the Partisans escaped by crossing the Vlasenica–Han Pijesak road to the east. Other Partisan forces withdrew {{in the direction of}} Goražde.|$|E

5|$|As the Brazilian {{army was}} ready for combat, Caxias sought to <b>encircle</b> Humaitá and force its {{capitulation}} by siege. To aid the operation, he used observation balloons to gather information of the enemy lines. The combined Brazilian–Argentine–Uruguayan army advanced through hostile territory to surround Humaitá. By 2 November, Humaitá was completely cut off from land reinforcement by Paraguayan forces. On 19 February 1868, Brazilian ironclads successfully made a passage up the Paraguay River under heavy fire, gaining full control {{of the river and}} isolating Humaitá from resupply by water.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the month}} the 2/6th had reached Nassau Bay where it secured landing beaches for an amphibious landing by US troops from the 162nd Regimental Combat Team. Once established, the 2/6th then led the way back west towards Bitoi Ridge, ranging ahead of the Americans as the Allies began to <b>encircle</b> Mubo. In early July, the 2/7th {{attacked}} Observation Hill and as the Japanese began to withdraw from Mubo, the 2/5th was sent north to act in support of the newly arrived Militia 15th Brigade, which was moving on Bobdubi Ridge. In mid-July, amidst heavy close-quarters fighting, the 2/5th Infantry Battalion captured the southern parts of Mount Tambu.|$|E
5|$|During the War of the Third Coalition in 1805–1806, Schmitt {{returned}} from retirement to active service. Equipped with a glowing letter of endorsement from Emperor Francis II to the Russian Infantry General Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov (1745–1813), Schmitt {{arrived at the}} Russian headquarters and was appointed Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Allied Army. Schmitt met with the Russian forces at the great abbey by Melk, on the Danube, and he and the commanders concocted a plan to <b>encircle</b> Édouard Mortier's French force near Dürenstein. To do so, they drew not only on their own military experience, but called upon a captain from the region, to use his geographic and local knowledge.|$|E
