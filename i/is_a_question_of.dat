5|$|When {{a pattern}} is called digital, this most often {{means that it}} is visibly {{composed}} of computer-generated pixels. The term is sometimes also used of computer generated patterns like the non-pixellated Multicam and the Italian fractal Vegetato pattern. Neither pixellation nor digitization contribute to the camouflaging effect. The pixellated style, however, simplifies design and eases printing on fabric, compared to traditional patterns. While digital patterns are becoming widespread, critics maintain that the pixellated look <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> fashion rather than function.|$|E
25|$|Ramsey's theorem is a {{foundational}} {{result in}} combinatorics. The {{first version of}} this result was proved by F. P. Ramsey. This initiated the combinatorial theory now called Ramsey theory, that seeks regularity amid disorder: general conditions {{for the existence of}} substructures with regular properties. In this application it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> the existence of monochromatic subsets, that is, subsets of connected edges of just one colour.|$|E

It <b>was</b> not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether the {{undertaking}} would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> immediately remunerative concern; it <b>was</b> not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether the railway should pay interest and sinking fund on the capital expended, or even if it would at once pay working expenses. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> preserving the predominance of Hong Kong. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> seeing that the final outlet of the main trunk railway should be at Kowloon, and at no other place." ...|$|R

25|$|We {{are offered}} {{a new style}} that is {{thoroughly}} of this world that celebrates the mundane. This new world of objects is still alien to the current idea of Realism. It employs various techniques that endow all things with a deeper meaning and reveal mysteries that always threaten the secure tranquility of simple and ingenuous things.... it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> representing before our eyes, in an intuitive way, the fact, the interior figure, of the exterior world.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent to}} which {{technology}} determines history and the creation and destiny of nations <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> historical scholarship, with the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology cited as a striking example. Initiated {{with the help of}} increasing Jewish unity made possible by the new communication technologies of the Second Industrial Revolution, the Technion was born 36 years before Israel declared independence. In that time it educated the engineers and brought the expertise to literally lay the infrastructure for a modern state. This included the fundamental infrastructure of electricity, water supplies and roads.|$|E
25|$|A peace {{made with}} foreigners {{at the expense}} of the princes of the blood; with the House of Lorraine {{at the expense of}} the House of France; with rebels at the expense of obedient subjects; with {{agitators}} at the expense of those who have brought peace by every means within their power.... I intend to oppose it with all my heart, and to this end to rally around me... all true Frenchmen without regard to religion, since this time it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> the defence of the state against the usurpation of foreigners.|$|E

It <b>was</b> not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> taking one's life--she would NEVER kill herself, that was repulsive and violent. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> KNOWING the next step. And the next step led into the space of death. Did it?--or was there--? ...|$|R
25|$|We have {{no doubt}} that if the Legislature of this State should {{undertake}} to proscribe for any offense against its laws the punishment of burning at the stake, breaking at the wheel, etc., it would be the duty of the courts to pronounce upon such attempt the condemnation of the Constitution. The question now to be answered is whether the legislative act here assailed is subject to the same condemnation. Certainly, it is not so on its face, for, although the mode of death described is conceded to be unusual, there is no common knowledge or consent that it is cruel; it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> fact whether an electric current of sufficient intensity and skillfully applied will produce death without unnecessary suffering.|$|E
25|$|As a {{primitive}} of the theory, {{the status of}} these functions is much different than in some constituency grammars. Traditionally, constituency grammars derive the syntactic functions from the constellation. For instance, the object is identified as the NP appearing inside finite VP, and the subject as the NP appearing outside of finite VP. Since DGs reject {{the existence of a}} finite VP constituent, they were never presented with the option to view the syntactic functions in this manner. The issue <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> what comes first: traditionally, DGs take the syntactic functions to be primitive and they then derive the constellation from these functions, whereas constituency grammars traditionally take the constellation to be primitive and they then derive the syntactic functions from the constellation.|$|E
25|$|Most labyrinthodonts {{had special}} sense organs in the skin, forming a lateral line organ for {{perception}} of water flow and pressure, like {{those found in}} fish {{and a number of}} modern amphibians. This would enable them to pick up the vibration of their prey and other waterborne sounds while hunting in murky, weed filled waters. Early labyrinthodont groups had massive stapes, likely primarily anchoring the brain case to the skull roof. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> some doubt whether early terrestrial labyrinthodonts had the stapes connected to a tympanum covering their otic notch, and if they had an aerial sense of hearing at all. The tympanum in anurans and amniotes appear to have evolved separately, indicating most, if not all, Labyrinthodonts were unable to pick up airborne sound.|$|E

500|$|While these {{ceramics}} {{were obviously}} recovered as grave goods, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> {{whether they were}} specifically created for a mortuary rite, or whether they were used prior to burial, perhaps by the deceased.

500|$|After this, however, he {{detailed}} ways {{in which}} he felt that Oppenheimer had hindered his efforts towards an active thermonuclear development program, and at length criticized Oppenheimer's decisions not to invest more work onto the question {{at different points in}} his career, saying: [...] "If it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> wisdom and judgment, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance." ...|$|E

500|$|Ames's {{work on the}} Biko affair led {{to major}} medical reforms in South Africa, {{including}} the disbanding and replacement of the old apartheid-era medical organisations which failed to uphold the medical standards of the profession. According to van Niekerk, [...] "the most enduring lesson for South African medicine was the clarification of the roles of medical practitioners when there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> dual responsibilities. This is now embodied inter alia in the SAMA Code of Conduct and in legal interpretations of doctors' responsibilities".|$|E
500|$|Conceptual {{uncertainty}} is the [...] "most fundamental in {{the validity of}} a trust or power", and is where the language used in the trust is unclear. Examples include where familiar but overly vague terms are used, such as [...] "good customers" [...] or [...] "useful employees"; if the concept cannot be certain, the trust fails. Evidential uncertainty, on the other hand, is where there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> fact {{it is impossible to}} answer, such as when a claimant cannot prove he is a beneficiary. This does not necessarily invalidate the trust, as Jenkins J (as he was then) said in Re Coxen: ...|$|E
500|$|After the British 5th Infantry Division had {{achieved}} its objectives, the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade attacked at 04:00 on 24 December. Despite intensive artillery support (272 guns on a [...] front), the tired and understrength New Zealand battalions {{struggled to make}} progress. By the afternoon, it had become clear to the New Zealand commander—Bernard Freyberg—that the stubborn defences of the 26th Panzer Division would not be broached. He {{is reported to have}} remarked, [...] "It {{is not a question of}} further advance, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> holding on to what we have got". The XIII Corps front was effectively deadlocked and settled into a posture of active defence and patrolling.|$|E

500|$|Detroit archdiocese {{spokesman}} Jay Berman said of {{a protest}} by the National Coalition of American Nuns (NCAN): [...] "Their efforts are confusing Catholics and misrepresenting 2,000 years of church teaching on {{the sanctity of}} human life." [...] Archbishop Szoka told the Pastoral Council that he was disappointed they did not support him. He said, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> my absolute duty to stand for, to protect and to defend {{the doctrine of the}} Church which has to do with human life." [...] On March 4, Archbishop Szoka met again with the leadership of the Detroit Sisters of Mercy, and he restated his directive. The Sisters determined {{they did not have to}} obey Szoka if [...] "a greater good was involved", and [...] refused to force Mansour to quit her job.|$|E
500|$|By February 1938 Reich's visa had expired. Several Norwegian {{scientists}} {{argued against}} an extension, Kreyberg saying, [...] "If it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> handing Dr. Reich {{over to the}} Gestapo, then I will fight that, but if one could {{get rid of him}} in a decent manner, that would be the best." [...] The writer Sigurd Hoel asked: [...] "When did it become a reason for deportation that one looked in a microscope when one was not a trained biologist?" [...] Reich received support from overseas, first from the anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, who in March wrote to the press in Norway that Reich's sociological works were [...] "a distinct and valuable contribution toward science," [...] and from A.S. Neill, founder of Summerhill, a progressive school in England, who argued that [...] "the campaign against Reich seems largely ignorant and uncivilized, more like fascism than democracy..." ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{opened the}} 1905 season with an {{unexpected}} 4–1 {{loss to the}} Canton Protectives, inspiring a local newspaper to comment that the Youngstown team made [...] "as many errors as hits while Canton fielded almost perfectly and hit opportunely". The Ohio Works club gained steam, however, and began to win games. On May 11, 1905, the Youngstown team garnered controversy when The Akron Times-Democrat reported that the Ohio Works' sponsors provided player salaries that nearly doubled those offered by other clubs in the Ohio–Pennsylvania League. In {{a report on the}} outcry in Akron, The Youngstown Daily Vindicator warned that, [...] "if the Youngstown backers keep adding and force the other clubs to add to the salaries, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> only a short time until independent baseball will be an impossibility". The newspaper article concluded that the large salaries provided by the Ohio Works's sponsors placed a special burden on teams based in [...] "smaller cities".|$|E

60|$|In {{the pain}} of that thought was born his conscience; not that fear of remorse which grows slowly, and slowly decays amongst the {{complicated}} facts of life, but a Divine wisdom springing full-grown, armed and severe out of a tried heart, to combat the secret baseness of motives. It came {{to him in a}} flash that morality <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> method of happiness. The revelation was terrible. He saw at once that nothing of what he knew mattered in the least. The acts of men and women, success, humiliation, dignity, failure--nothing mattered. It <b>was</b> not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> more or less pain, of this joy, of that sorrow. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> truth or falsehood--it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> life or death.|$|R
