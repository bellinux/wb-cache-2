25|$|Having {{addressed}} the social prejudices against him, Socrates addresses the first accusation — the moral corruption of Athenian youth — by accusing his accuser, Meletus, of being {{indifferent to the}} persons and things about which he professes to care. Whilst interrogating Meletus, Socrates says {{that no one would}} intentionally corrupt another person — because the corrupter later stands to be harmed in vengeance by the corrupted person. The matter of moral corruption is important for two reasons: (i) corruption is the accusation that he (Socrates) corrupted the rich, young men of Athens by teaching atheism; (ii) that if he is convicted of corruption, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the playwright Aristophanes already had corrupted the minds of his audience, when they were young, by lampooning Socrates as the “Sophistical philosopher” in The Clouds, a comic play produced about twenty-four years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E

[...] The Alumnus concluded: [...] "If Michigan has a winning team, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> some of the enthusiasm of her coach has been transferred to the men." ...|$|E

If I win, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> I {{have a little bit}} of luck and some of the others have trouble. I mean, Hannu Mikkola knows the forests like the back of his hand so there is no use trying to drive to beat him. You have to wait for him to have trouble. Then you are in with a chance." ...|$|E
500|$|Though in {{the view}} of some writers Werther is the composer's masterpiece, it was not {{immediately}} taken up with the same keenness as Manon. The first performance in Paris was in January 1893 by the Opéra-Comique company at the Théâtre Lyrique, and there were performances in the United States, Italy and Britain, but it met with a muted response. The New York Times said of it, [...] "If M. Massenet's opera does not have lasting success <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> it has no genuine depth. Perhaps M. Massenet is not capable of achieving profound depths of tragic passion; but certainly he will never do so in a work like Werther". [...] It was not until a revival by the Opéra-Comique in 1903 that the work became an established favourite.|$|E
500|$|Calvin's friends {{urged him}} to marry. Calvin took a prosaic view, writing to one correspondent:I, who have the air of being so hostile to celibacy, I am still not married and {{do not know whether}} I will ever be. If I take a wife <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>because,</b> being better freed from {{numerous}} worries, I can devote myself to the Lord. Several candidates were presented to him including one young woman from a noble family. Reluctantly, Calvin agreed to the marriage, on the condition that she would learn French. Although a wedding date was planned for March 1540, he remained reluctant and the wedding never took place. He later wrote that he would never think of marrying her, [...] "unless the Lord had entirely bereft me of my wits". Instead, in August of that year, he married Idelette de Bure, a widow who had two children from her first marriage.|$|E

50|$|M.G.G. Pillai, one of Asiaweeks casualties, {{says the}} {{magazine}} lost focus and became increasingly Americanised after Time took over. Unlike Reyes, {{he was not}} optimistic that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> replaced <b>because</b> most magazines in Asia depend on the patronage of political rulers, and most financiers have an axe to grind.|$|R
500|$|The {{tropical}} climate of Basse Casamance cycles between a dry {{season and a}} wet season, which usually starts in June and ends in October. Because of the proximity to the ocean, the humidity of the air remains above 40% and contributes to the abundance of vegetation. With the trade winds from the Azores High, the island enjoys a pleasant climate year-round. In the north to north-east, these winds are cool and always wet. Their presence is appreciated by kitesurfers. Agricultural activities, including rice cultivation, depend entirely on rainfall. [...] "Wah uŋejutumu, emit elaatut" [...] is a Jola proverb which means [...] "If a project will not be completed, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the rain did not fall." [...] The invocation of fetishes {{when there is no}} rain is part of traditional animist rituals. In recent decades, there has been a general decline in rainfall, which threatens rice production, increases soil salinity, and contributes to the degradation of the mangroves. In May and June, air temperature is around [...] In January and February, the coldest months, it is around [...] Temperatures of below [...] are quite rare. In September, the temperature of surface seawater is [...]|$|E
2500|$|I {{think it}} will eclipse in point of {{interest}} and attendance any football game ever played in the Middle West. [...] If we do not draw close to 28,000 spectators, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> something has gone wrong.|$|E

Seeing our crippled state, my own opinion is, that the natives will not let us go off without making at least one attempt to surprise us." ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with GQ magazine, Lichtman explained his thought process for predicting a Trump impeachment: [...] "it {{is based on a}} deep study of history, including Trump's parallels to his impeached predecessors; a study of the process of impeachment; a study of Trump's vulnerabilities". He explained why he chose to write the book at this particular point, emphasizing it was to provide a guide for the public, and [...] "because impeachment is a political process that occurs outside of the courts. It is responsive to the people, and if impeachment is going to take place, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the American people demand it." [...] Lichtman said because there were many potential unlawful activities, [...] "I believe he is more vulnerable than any early president {{in the history of the}} nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2016, {{during the}} week leading up to Record Store Day, for which the band was its {{ambassador}} for 2016, Ulrich told Billboard that the band's expanded role within the music industry had {{played a part in}} {{the amount of time that}} it had taken to write and record the album. [...] "The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." [...] Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. [...] "Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016". In May 2016, Ulrich said in an interview with Metal Forces that the album would be released in the summer of 2016, and that details for the new album would be finalized in the next month. [...] "If the record doesn't come out this year then it won't be because it’s not done... <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> there's some sort of cosmic reason that it would be smarter to hold onto it until next year. But the record will be done this summer". Recording of the album was completed in June 2016 once the recording for the song [...] "Hardwired" [...] was finished.|$|E

50|$|The content {{depicted}} by {{the painting is}} often either a traditional Dreaming story or a map.
