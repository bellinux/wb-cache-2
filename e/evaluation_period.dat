40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a hedge fund}} manager's risk-taking profile and evaluate how fund composition and multiple <b>evaluation</b> <b>periods</b> affect risk-levels. The fund composition refers to the specific characteristics that result from investors entering the fund {{at different points in}} time, implying various maturities and strike levels for high-water mark incentive contracts. Multiple <b>evaluation</b> <b>periods</b> is the inclusion of long-term managerial compensation to the decision process. Using a numerical simulation framework we compute and analyse the optimal behaviour of a fund manager with constant relative risk aversion. In existing literature - where the fund is depicted as one, homogeneous pool of investments, evaluated over a single period - manager risk-taking fluctuates heavily depending on time to maturity and moneyness of the manager's incentive option. By introducing a diversified fund composition as well as accounting for multiple <b>evaluation</b> <b>periods,</b> the manager's behaviour is considerably less extreme, reducing manager-investor risk misalignment. Our results suggests that the fund composition is relevant to the individual investor, as it potentially affects the overall risk profile and thereby the value of the investment. Furthermore, our results prove an interesting study in examining the efficiency of option-like incentive contracts in relieving agency problems...|$|R

During Aksys' <b>evaluation</b> <b>period</b> of it, many people at the company did not believe in the game and turned it down; as {{many of the people who}} evaluate games at Aksys do not speak Japanese, it was difficult for them to determine whether a game was good or not. Eventually, they decided to localize it, which was considered a big risk for the company. They worked by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese version, opting to make dialogue sound like what a native speaker would say rather than strictly adhering to the Japanese wording. Ben Bateman, the editor of the first two games' localizations, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, examining it line by line or scene by scene, rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, and thinking about how to convey the same idea in English. Most parts of the games that include a joke in the localization also have a joke in the Japanese versions, but a different one; Bateman did try to make similar types of jokes with similar contents and ideas. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add to the writing, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E

40|$|Background: Despite {{advances}} in surgical training, microsurgery is still {{based on an}} apprenticeship model. To evaluate skill acquisition and apply targeted feedback to improve their training model, the authors applied the Structured Assessment of Microsurgery Skills to the training of microsurgical fellows. They hypothesized that subjects would demonstrate measurable improvement in performance throughout the study period and consistently across evaluators. Methods: Seven fellows were evaluated during 118 microsurgical cases by 16 evaluators over three 1 -month <b>evaluation</b> <b>periods</b> in 1 year (2010 to 2011). Evaluators used the Structured Assessment of Microsurgery Skills questionnaire, which measures dexterity, visuospatial ability, operative flow, and judgment. To validate the data, microsurgical anastomoses in rodents performed by the fellows in a laboratory {{at the beginning and}} end of the study period were evaluated by five blinded plastic surgeons using the same questionnaire. Primary outcomes were change in scores between <b>evaluation</b> <b>periods</b> and interevaluator reliability. Results: Between the first two <b>evaluation</b> <b>periods,</b> all skill areas and overall performance improved significantly. Between the second two periods, most skill areas improved, but only a few improved significantly. Operative errors decreased significantly between the first and subsequent periods (81 versus 36; p < 0. 05). In the laboratory study, all skills were significantly (p < 0. 05) or marginally (0. 05 < p < 0. 10) improved between time points. The overall interevaluator reliability of the questionnaire was acceptable ([α] = 0. 67). Conclusions: The Structured Assessment of Microsurgery Skills questionnaire is a valid instrument for assessing microsurgical skill, providing individualized feedback with acceptable interevaluator reliability. Use of the questionnaire is anticipated to enhance microsurgical training. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the sample size (i. e., number of plants) required to accurately estimate the average of morphological traits of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) and to check for variability in sample size between <b>evaluation</b> <b>periods</b> and seasons. Two uniformity trials (i. e., experiments without treatment) were conducted for two growing seasons. In the first season (2011 / 2012), the seeds were sown by broadcast seeding, and in the second season (2012 / 2013), the seeds were sown in rows spaced 0. 50 m apart. The ground area in each experiment was 1, 848 m 2, and 360 plants were marked in the central area, in a 2 m × 2 m grid. Three morphological traits (e. g., number of nodes, plant height and stem diameter) were evaluated 13 times during the first season and 22 times in the second season. Measurements for all three morphological traits were normally distributed and confirmed through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Randomness was confirmed using the Run Test, and the descriptive statistics were calculated. For each trait, the sample size (n) was calculated for the semiamplitudes of the confidence interval (i. e., estimation error) equal to 2, 4, 6, [...] ., 20 % of the estimated mean with a confidence coefficient (1 -?) of 95 %. Subsequently, n was fixed at 360 plants, and the estimation error of the estimated percentage of the average for each trait was calculated. Variability of the sample size for the pigeonpea culture was observed between the morphological traits evaluated, among the <b>evaluation</b> <b>periods</b> and between seasons. Therefore, to assess with an accuracy of 6 % of the estimated average, at least 136 plants must be evaluated throughout the pigeonpea crop cycle to determine the sample size for the traits (e. g., number of nodes, plant height and stem diameter) in the different <b>evaluation</b> <b>periods</b> and between seasons.  </p...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{replicates}} {{the study}} of Benartzi and Thaler (1995), who sug- gest a behavioral explanation to the equity premium puzzle by myopic loss aversion. A technical extension to their methodology is suggested where con- ditional heteroskedasticity is incorporated when simulating returns, {{in place of the}} original temporal independence assumption. Swedish data is considered in addition to U. S. data. First, it is found that myopic loss aversion can explain the U. S. equity premium over bonds, although the obtained evaluation peri- ods are somewhat shorter than a year. For example, over the full U. S. sample period from 1926 to 2003, <b>evaluation</b> <b>periods</b> of seven and ten months are found using the original and the new approach to simulating returns, respec- tively. Second, myopic loss aversion suggestively explains the Swedish equity premium as well, which is new to the literature. Third, throughout the analy- sis of both data sets, longer <b>evaluation</b> <b>periods</b> are obtained under conditional heteroskedasticity.
