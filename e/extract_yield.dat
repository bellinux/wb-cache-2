40|$|This {{study was}} on the {{kinetics}} and process parameters for ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of water-soluble components and polysaccharides (PS) from the dry mycelium of a medicinal fungus, Cordyceps sinensis Cs-HK 1. Four process variables (factors) were evaluated at different levels, ultrasound intensity (2. 44 - 44. 1 W/cm 2), temperature (40 - 70 °C), solid particle size (156. 5 - 750 μm), and solid-to-liquid ratio (1 / 30 - 1 / 70 g/mL). The experimental data of yields versus time in most cases were fitted closely to two empirical kinetic models for solid-liquid extraction, parabolic diffusion equation (y=yo+y 1 t 1 / 2) and power law (y=βtn) with high correlation coefficients (R 2) of 0. 95 - 0. 99 for total <b>extract</b> <b>yield,</b> and 0. 90 - 0. 96 for PS yield. The PS yield was increased more significantly than the total <b>extract</b> <b>yield</b> with the ultrasound intensity. Reducing the particle size and increasing the extraction temperature led to a higher yield and extraction rate; increasing the solid-to-liquid ratio (or decreasing the liquid volume) increased the PS yield and extraction rate but had little influence on the total extract.
