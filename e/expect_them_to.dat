5|$|In the {{operation}} the 6th Airborne Division {{together with the}} 7th Armoured Division, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, formed the I Corps, attached to the First Canadian Army. When issuing his orders, Lieutenant General John Crocker, the Corps commander, aware that the 6th Airborne had almost no artillery, vehicles or engineer equipment, did not <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> advance quickly. To reach the River Seine the division would have to cross three main rivers, along only two main lines of advance. One route was in the north, running along the French coast, while the other route was further inland between Troarn and Pont Audemer.|$|E
5|$|Starting at 11am on March 14, Thieu {{flew out}} to Cam Ranh for a {{briefing}} with General Phu. The events {{which took place}} after this briefing would go down {{as one of the}} greatest failures in military history. After Phu had outlined the military situation in the Central Highlands, he asked Thieu to bolster the South Vietnamese 6th Air Force Division with more aircraft and additional brigades to defend Kontum and Pleiku. Thieu refused to send further reinforcements because the South Vietnamese military no longer had the resources. Phu was ordered to move all his units down to the Mekong region where they could continue fighting. General Vien cautioned against moving large military formations down Highway 19; he reminded Thieu of the destruction suffered by the French Mobile Group 100 in the region in 1954. Thieu and his commanders made the decision to use Route 7 instead, in an attempt to surprise the North Vietnamese, who would not <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> use that road due to its poor condition.|$|E

25|$|Police {{officers}} are legally permitted to use force, and their superiors — {{and the public}} — <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> do so. According to Jerome Herbert Skolnick, in dealing largely with disorderly elements of the society, some people working in law enforcement may gradually develop an attitude or sense of authority over society, particularly under traditional reaction-based policing models; {{in some cases the}} police believe that they are above the law.|$|E
25|$|Snow Patrol joined {{independent}} label Jeepster in 1997, home of Belle & Sebastian. Jeepster had {{the same}} idea for Snow Patrol as the approach they had with Belle & Sebastian, who had become popular by word-of-mouth, without heavy promotion. The band were happy {{to be associated with}} an indie label, because it provided them greater independence than a major label. At that time, they were quoted as saying they expected Jeepster wouldn't <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> have a strict work ethic or focus too much on promotional efforts.|$|E
25|$|Job {{interviews}} {{and other data}} on requirements for lower skilled workers in developed countries – particularly in the growing service sector – indicate that the more workers depend on low wages, and the less skilled or desirable their job is, the more employers screen for workers without better employment options and <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> feign unremunerative motivation. Such screening and feigning may not only contribute to the positive self-image of the employer as someone granting desirable employment, but also signal wage-dependence by indicating the employee's willingness to feign, which in turn may discourage the dissatisfaction normally associated with job-switching or union activity.|$|E

25|$|The decisive battle soon followed. Unlike most {{battles of}} the Second Punic War, the Romans had superiority in cavalry and the Carthaginians had superiority in infantry. The Roman army was {{generally}} better armed and trained than the Carthaginians. Hannibal had refused to lead this army into battle, {{because he did not}} <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be able to perform. There had been very bitter arguments between him and the oligarchy. His co-general, Hasdrubal Gisco, was forced to commit suicide by a violent mob after he spoke in support of Hannibal's view that such troops should not be led into battle. Before the battle, Hannibal gave no speech to his new troops, only to his veterans.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier {{urged the}} {{establishment}} of a Royal Commission on Agriculture. He then served as its Secretary and spent considerable sums of his own money in order to improve the agricultural yields in the Sologne, an area where farmland was of poor quality. The humidity of the region often led to a blight of the rye harvest, causing outbreaks of ergotism among the population. In 1788 Lavoisier presented a report to the Commission detailing ten years of efforts on his experimental farm to introduce new crops and types of livestock. His conclusion was that despite the possibilities of agricultural reforms, the tax system left tenant farmers with so little that it was unrealistic to <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> change their traditional practices.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} is explicitly {{told that he}} is reacting normally to extreme stress {{and is expected to}} recover and return to full duty in a few hours or days. A military leader is extremely effective in this area of treatment. Of all the things said to a Service member suffering from combat stress, the words of his small-unit leader have the greatest impact due to the positive bonding process that occurs during combat. Simple statements from the small-unit leader to the Service member that he is reacting normally to combat stress and is expected back soon have positive impact. Small-unit leaders should tell Service members that their comrades need and <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> return. When they do return, the unit treats them as every other Service member and expects them to perform well. Service members suffering and recovering from combat stress disorder are no more likely to become overloaded again than are those who have not yet been overloaded. In fact, {{they are less likely to}} become overloaded than inexperienced replacements.|$|E

25|$|Women's lack {{of access}} to higher {{education}} had effectively excluded them from the practice of well-paid and high status occupations. Entry of women into the higher professions like law and medicine was delayed in most countries due to women being denied entry to universities and qualification for degrees; for example, Cambridge University only fully validated degrees for women late in 1947, and even then only after much opposition and acrimonious debate. Women were largely limited to low-paid and poor status occupations for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, or earned less pay than men for doing the same work. However, through the 20th century, public perceptions of paid work shifted as the workforce increasingly moved to office jobs that do not require heavy labor, and women increasingly acquired the higher education that led to better-compensated, longer-term careers rather than lower-skilled, shorter-term jobs. Despite this, women are still at a disadvantage compared to men because of motherhood. Women are viewed as the primary caregiver to children still to this day, so their pay is lowered when they have children because businesses do not <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> stay long after the birth.|$|E
25|$|Once girls enter school, patriarchal {{norms and}} values work against norms {{and values of}} modern {{education}} which aims to provide equal education for boys and girls. Parents may allow girls to attend school but still <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> fulfill traditional duties rather than giving then time to do homework or arrive at school before school gates are shut. Girls are expected to participate in class contrary to their training for non-participation. If girls try to meet school norms for participation they are subjected to psychological violence reinforcing patriarchal norms. Girls may also be subjected to violence and abuse at home if they act on new school norms contrary to tradition. This clash of norms continues {{on the way to}} and from school with older boys and adult men seeing adolescent girls as unprotected by marriage. Consequently, girls experience physical and sexual violence and are at risk of abduction. Girls' attempts to cope with the educational system may increase their risk of violence and sexual abuse. Girl students were some of the main perpetrators of violence against other girls and they could act as go-betweens for boys in the hope that boys would favor them.|$|E

500|$|Hinton was {{not always}} respectful of {{military}} authority. Shortly after the New Zealanders arrived in Egypt, he was commanding a squad practising on a rifle range when visited by the division's commander, Major General Bernard Freyberg, who asked him how the men were shooting. [...] "How would you <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> bloody well shoot?", replied Hinton, [...] "not enough bloody rations, stinking heat and sand". [...] Freyberg asked him to repeat the comment, which he did word for word. Freyberg took note of Hinton's name and instructed him to carry on. There was a subsequent increase in rations, while Hinton was advised by his company commander {{on how best to}} speak to senior officers.|$|E
500|$|Vickers, {{who would}} leave Hendrick Motorsports in 2007 for Red Bull Racing Team, said: [...] "I would <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{be a little}} upset.

[...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way.

[...] It was late by the time the British arrived and the French, anchored in a strong position with a combined firepower greater than that of Nelson's fleet, did not <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> attack. Nelson however immediately ordered his ships to advance. The French line was anchored close to a line of shoals, in the belief that this would secure their port side from attack; Brueys had assumed the British would follow convention and attack his centre from the starboard side. However, Captain Thomas Foley aboard [...] discovered a gap between the shoals and the French ships, and took Goliath into the channel. The unprepared French found themselves attacked on both sides, the British fleet splitting, with some following Foley and others passing down the starboard side of the French line.|$|E

500|$|One critic, Matt Singer of indieWIRE, said in January 2013 {{that he has}} [...] "started to look at January with {{anticipation}} rather than dread." [...] He argues that even the month's bad movies are bad in their own way. Unlike failed summer blockbusters, which have [...] "way too much money riding on [...] {{to be anything but}} mediocre and boring," [...] January movies are often spectacular in their failure since the studios do not <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> do well. [...] "Why throw good money after bad?" [...] he asks rhetorically. [...] "Just cut your losses and let the thing really suck." [...] Such benign neglect, he suggests, led to The Devil Inside, [...] "so intensely stupid it's almost brilliant—and entirely entertaining." [...] He likened January movies to trainwrecks, while bad movies in June were more like [...] "controlled demolitions." [...] Cloverfield, he asserted, had begun reversing the trend of forgettable January movies. In more recent years he had been impressed by The Grey and Mama.|$|E
500|$|With {{the capture}} of Breville the {{division}} was not attacked in force again, apart from an almost continuous artillery bombardment between 18 and 20June.
