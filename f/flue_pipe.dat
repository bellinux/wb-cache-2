50|$|A <b>flue</b> <b>pipe</b> (also {{referred}} to as a labial pipe) is an organ pipe that produces sound through the vibration of air molecules, {{in the same manner as}} a recorder or a whistle. Air under pressure (called wind) is driven down a flue and against a sharp lip called a Labium, causing the column of air in the pipe to resonate at a frequency determined by the pipe length (see wind instrument). Thus, there are no moving parts in a <b>flue</b> <b>pipe.</b> This is in contrast to reed pipes, whose sound is driven by beating reeds, as in a clarinet. Flue pipes are common components of pipe organs.|$|E
5000|$|Gedackt (also spelled gedeckt) is {{the name}} of a family of stops in pipe organ building. They {{are one of the most}} common types of organ <b>flue</b> <b>pipe.</b> The name stems from the Middle High German word gedact, meaning [...] "capped" [...] or [...] "covered".|$|E
50|$|Organ pipes are so {{sensitive}} to temperature {{that the body}} heat of the organ tuner can affect the tuning. If one holds a small metal <b>flue</b> <b>pipe</b> briefly in one's hand and then returns it to the chest, its pitch (relative to a tuning reference) can be heard to change as the pipe returns to room temperature.|$|E

50|$|Scaling is {{important}} when determining the final tone {{color of a}} reed pipe, {{though it is not}} of primary importance as it is in <b>flue</b> <b>pipe</b> construction. This is because reed pipe resonators simply reinforce certain partials of the sound wave; the air column inside the resonator is not the primary vibrator. The shape of the resonator, however, is quite important: an inverted-conical resonator (such as is typical with a Trumpet rank) produces more harmonics than does a cylindrical resonator (like that of a Clarinet rank).|$|E
50|$|Paldalmun, {{known locally}} as Nammun (South Gate), sits {{in the middle of}} a {{roundabout}} on a busy main road in central Suwon. Its stone base is capped with a two-storey wooden pavilion surrounded by a stone wall. A small, semi-circular protective wall known as an ongseong, is located on the south side (outside) of the gate. The gate also houses a bell called Paldalmun Dongjong, which was originally cast in Gaeseong in 1080 and was refounded in 1687 by Dohwaseung, the chief priest of Manuisa Temple, for use in Buddhist ceremonies. 123 cm tall and 75 cm in diameter, it hangs from a dragon-shaped suspension ring, has a <b>flue</b> <b>pipe</b> to set the tone and has a slightly curved body - features which are typical of Korean bells of that era. This particular bell's <b>flue</b> <b>pipe</b> has a design of the dragon's tail entwined around it and is topped with a lotus flower. The top of the bell has a line of Sanskrit words around it, while the bottom is decorated with arabesque designs. The decorative nipples are interspaced with Bodisattvas holding lotus flowers. The bell is very similar in design to that in Tongdosa, which differs notably from Paldalmun's only in size.|$|E

President & CEO of Legal Sea Foods, Roger Berkowitz, said that the company would install carbon monoxide detectors and conduct comprehensive safety audits at all locations. He also pledged to be at the forefront of legislative efforts to require the use of carbon monoxide detectors in commercial buildings.|$|E

25|$|Flutes can {{be played}} with several {{different}} air sources. Conventional flutes are blown with the mouth, although some cultures use nose flutes. The <b>flue</b> <b>pipes</b> of organs, which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, are blown by bellows or fans.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} obtain the great heat required, the whole wall was lined with {{vertical}} terra-cotta <b>flue</b> <b>pipes</b> of rectangular section, placed side by side, through which hot air and smoke from the suspensura passed to an exit in the roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{recorder}} produces {{sound in}} the manner of a whistle or an organ <b>flue</b> <b>pipe.</b> In normal play, the player blows into the windway (B), a narrow channel in the headjoint, which directs a stream of air across a gap, called the window, at a sharp edge called the labium (C). The air stream alternately travels above and below the labium, exciting standing waves in the bore of the recorder, and producing sound waves, emanating away from the window. Feedback from the resonance of the tube regulates the pitch of the sound produced.|$|E
50|$|The {{resonator}} {{supports the}} oscillations of air generated {{at the mouth}} of the pipe, a horizontal opening at the juncture of the resonator with the foot. The voicing, the length of the resonator, and the resonator's volume all determine the fundamental pitch of the <b>flue</b> <b>pipe.</b> The conical taper of the pipe determines the overblown pitch. If the pipe is metal, a tuning sleeve or tuning collar may be fixed at the top of the resonator and raised or lowered to vary its length, thereby adjusting the pitch produced.|$|E
50|$|The {{diameter}} of a <b>flue</b> <b>pipe</b> directly affects its tone. When comparing pipes of otherwise identical shape and size, a wide pipe {{will tend to}} produce a flute tone, a medium pipe a diapason tone, and a narrow pipe a string tone. These relationships {{are referred to as}} the scale of the pipe: i.e., wide-scaled, normal-scaled, or narrow-scaled. As a pipe's scale increases, more fundamental will be present, and fewer partials will be present in the tone. Thus, the tone becomes richer and fuller as the pipe's diameter widens from string scale to principal scale to flute scale.|$|E
5000|$|As in organ <b>flue</b> <b>pipes,</b> the {{sounding}} pitch of duct type whistles {{is affected by}} the velocity of the air stream as it impinges upon the labium. The pitch generally increases with velocity of the airstream, up to a point.|$|R
25|$|Heating {{is usually}} {{carried out by}} steam heat {{exchangers}} and pipes of various configurations (e.g. plain, or finned (transverse or longitudinal) tubes) or by large <b>flue</b> <b>pipes</b> through which hot gases from a wood burning furnace are passed. Only occasionally is electricity or gas employed for heating.|$|R
50|$|In principle, the portative is {{a smaller}} {{instrument}} than the positive organ, which features more ranks of pipes {{and a larger}} keyboard. The portative also {{should not be confused}} with the regal, a small keyboard instrument that contains a rank of short-length reed <b>pipes</b> instead of <b>flue</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The end of {{the pipe}} {{opposite}} the reed or mouth may be either open or closed (also known as stopped). A closed <b>flue</b> <b>pipe</b> with a uniform cross-section sounds an octave lower than a similar open pipe of the same length. Also, such an open pipe produces a tone in which both the even-numbered and the odd-numbered partials are present, while a stopped pipe, such as a gedackt, produces a tone with odd-numbered partials. The tone of a stopped pipe tends to be gentler and sweeter than that of an open pipe, though this is largely {{at the discretion of}} the voicer.|$|E
5000|$|Interaction {{between the}} air reed {{and the air}} column {{in the body of}} the {{instrument}} excites standing waves in the air column, which determines the pitch of the sound. This oscillation results in the [...] "whistle sound" [...] in ducted flue instruments. See wind instrument and <b>flue</b> <b>pipe.</b> A distinct tone color, determined by the dimensions of the instrument and the voicing mouth, is then slightly modified by the player's technique or embouchure. In instruments such as the recorder, the player can vary the pitch of the resulting musical note by opening or closing finger holes along the bore of the instrument, thus changing the effective length.|$|E
50|$|Flue pipes may be {{metallic}} or wooden. Metal pipes {{are usually}} circular in cross section; wooden pipes are usually square or rectangular, though triangular and round wooden pipes do exist. A <b>flue</b> <b>pipe</b> has two major parts, {{a foot and}} a resonator. The foot is the bottom portion of the pipe, usually conical. At its base is the toe hole, through which wind enters it. The length of the foot does not affect the pipe's pitch, so organ builders vary the foot lengths of their flue pipes depending on other factors, including the desired shape of the pipes in the façade, the height of the rackboard in which the pipes are seated, and the weight of the completed pipe.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flue</b> <b>pipes</b> {{generally}} {{belong to}} one of three tonal families: flutes, diapasons (or principals), and strings. The basic [...] "foundation" [...] (from the French term [...] ) sound of an organ is composed of varying combinations of these three tonal groups, depending upon the particular organ and the repertory being played.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>flue</b> <b>pipes</b> are {{designed}} to produce the sounds of reed pipes or to imitate the sounds of orchestral instruments which are approximated by reed pipes. The sound is generally more mellow and sweet {{than that of a}} true reed pipe. Examples include the Saxophone, the Muted horn, the Clarinet flute, and the Echo oboe.|$|R
50|$|Scaling is {{the ratio}} of an organ pipe's {{diameter}} to its length. The scaling of a pipe is {{a major influence on}} its timbre. Reed pipes are scaled according to different formulas than for <b>flue</b> <b>pipes.</b> In general, the larger the diameter of a given pipe at a given pitch, the fuller and more fundamental the sound becomes.|$|R
50|$|The {{different}} {{sounds of}} these tonal families of pipes arise from their individual construction. The tone of a <b>flue</b> <b>pipe</b> {{is affected by}} {{the size and shape of}} the pipes as well as the material out of which it is made. A pipe with a wide diameter will tend to produce a flute tone, a pipe with a medium diameter a diapason tone, and a pipe with a narrow diameter a string tone. A large diameter pipe will favor the fundamental tone and restrict high frequency harmonics, while a narrower diameter favors the high harmonics and suppresses the fundamental. The science of measuring and deciding upon pipe diameters is referred to as pipe scaling, and the resulting measurements are referred to as the scale of the pipe.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sound of}} a <b>flue</b> <b>pipe</b> is {{produced}} with no moving parts, solely from the vibration of air, {{in the same manner}} as a recorder or a whistle. Wind from the [...] "flue", or windway is driven over an open window and against a sharp lip called a Labium. By Bernoulli's principle this produces a lower pressure region just below the window [...] When the vacuum under the window is large enough, the airstream is pulled under the Labium lip. Then the process works in reverse, with a low pressure region forming over the Labium which pulls the airstream to the other side again. This 'fluttering' airflow creates high and low pressure waves within the pipe's air column. A high and a low pressure wave form a single [...] "cycle" [...] of the pipe's tone. (See Wind Instrument.) ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the system}} of organ <b>flue</b> <b>pipe</b> scaling, [...] "flutes" [...] are {{generally}} the widest flue pipes and produce the tone with the most fundamental and the least harmonics among flue pipes. They are so named because they sound like the orchestral flute; though most flute stops are not intended to imitate the orchestral instrument, they produce a similar sound. A stopped flute, such as the [...] (German for [...] "covered"), produces a more muffled sound, while an open flute, such as the [...] (German for [...] "forest flute"), produces a rounder, open sound. The [...] (French for [...] "harmonic flute"), whose use the great 19th-century French organ builder Aristide Cavaillé-Coll advocated, is a metal flute pipe of double length with a hole punched in the center, which causes the pipe to speak at its first partial with a very round, intense sound. Cavaillé-Coll used the names [...] and [...] for the 4-foot and 2-foot harmonic flutes, respectively. The [...] (German for [...] "pipe flute", or more commonly [...] "chimney flute" [...] in English) is a stopped flute rank with a small pipe or chimney built into the cap.|$|E
50|$|Tonal {{revisions}} and refinements {{were carried}} out in 2008/09 by the South Island Organ Company (SIOC) of Timaru, New Zealand. This included lengthening the resonators of the chorus reeds {{to provide a more}} fundamental tone quality and a thorough cleaning and regulation of the <b>flue</b> <b>pipes</b> to improve the overall quality and cohesion of the sound.|$|R
50|$|String pipes are the smallest-scaled <b>flue</b> <b>pipes.</b> They {{produce a}} bright sound that {{is low in}} {{fundamentals}} and rich in upper partials. String stops are generally named after bowed string instruments such as the Violoncelle, the Gamba, the Geigen (from the German , for violin), and the Viol. One {{of the most famous}} organs with a String Division is the Wanamaker Organ.|$|R
50|$|A {{reed pipe}} (also {{referred}} to as a lingual pipe) is an organ pipe that is sounded by a vibrating brass strip known as a reed. Air under pressure ({{referred to as}} wind) is directed towards the reed, which vibrates at a specific pitch. This is in contrast to <b>flue</b> <b>pipes,</b> which contain no moving parts and produce sound solely through the vibration of air molecules. Reed pipes are common components of pipe organs.|$|R
