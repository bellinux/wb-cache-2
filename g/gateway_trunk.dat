5000|$|The {{key to the}} {{new system}} was {{two-stage}} multi-frequency pulsing. The outgoing sender sent its Class 4 toll center an off-hook signal as usual, received a wink as usual as a [...] "proceed to send" [...] signal, and outpulsed only a special 3-digit (later 6-digit) access code. The toll center picked a trunk through the long distance network to the gateway office, which sent a second wink to the originating office, which then sent the whole dialed number. Thus the toll switching system needed no modification except at the <b>gateway.</b> The international <b>trunks</b> used Signaling System No. 5, a [...] "North Atlantic" [...] version of the North American multi-frequency signaling system, with minor modifications including slightly higher digit rate. European MF systems of the time used compelled signalling, which would slow down too much on a long transoceanic connection.|$|R

The goal of the MSF is to promote multi-vendor interoperability {{as part of a}} drive to accelerate the deployment of next generation networks. To this end the MSF looks to adopt pragmatic solutions in order to maximize the chances for early deployment in real world networks. To date the MSF has defined a number of detailed Implementation Agreements and detailed Test Plans for the signaling protocols between network components and is developing additional Implementation Agreements and Test Plans addressing some of the other technical issues such as QoS and Security to assist vendors and operators in deploying interoperable solutions. The MSF welcomes feedback and comment and would encourage interested parties to get involved in this work program.
