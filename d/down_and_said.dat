5|$|Wembley bosses were {{in dispute}} with {{newsreel}} companies over the broadcast {{rights for the}} 1936 final. Gaumont British Film Company initially had offered £900 to film inside the ground, but this was refused by the authorities who wanted a sum of £1,500. They later backed <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that they would accept the initial offer, but the film company was now only willing to pay £500. A solution could not be reached, and the media were banned from inside of the stadium. To get around the ban {{and be able to}} report on the match, a number of autogyros were hired to fly the reporters over the stadium giving them a birds–eye view of the match, with the only filming inside Wembley conducted by the official stadium cameraman. Autogyros had been used to film the final in 1935, and also by the Metropolitan police for crowd control.|$|E
500|$|Members of Ferraro's {{family were}} indeed facing legal issues. Her husband John Zaccaro had {{pleaded guilty in}} , to fraudulently obtaining bank {{financing}} in a real estate transaction and had been sentenced to 150hours of community service. Then in , he was indicted on unrelated felony charges regarding an alleged 1981 bribery of Queens Borough President Donald Manes concerning a cable television contract. A full year later, he was acquitted at trial. The case against him was circumstantial, a key prosecution witness proved unreliable, and the defense {{did not have to}} present its own testimony. Ferraro said her husband never would have been charged had she not run for vice president. Meanwhile, in , the couple's son John had been arrested for possession and sale of cocaine. He was convicted, and in , sentenced to four months imprisonment; Ferraro broke down in tears in court relating the stress the episode had placed on her family. Ferraro worked on an unpublished book about the conflicting rights between a free press and being able to have fair trials. Asked in , whether she would have accepted the vice-presidential nomination had she known of all the family problems that would follow, she said, [...] "More than once I have sat <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to myself, oh, God, I wish I had never gone through with it...

[...] However, Gu Li brandished his sword at the crew and threatened, [...] "I'll execute any person who does not go to Fankou."

2500|$|The song {{attracted}} {{attention from}} the start due {{to some of the}} language used in its second verse, where MacGowan's character refers to MacColl's character as [...] "an old slut on junk" [...] (heroin), and MacColl responds with a tirade that includes the words [...] "faggot" [...] and [...] "arse". On 18 December 2007, BBC Radio 1 banned the words [...] "faggot" [...] and [...] "slut" [...] from [...] "Fairytale of New York" [...] to [...] "avoid offence". MacColl's mother, Jean, called the ban [...] "too ridiculous", while The Pogues said they found it [...] "amusing". The BBC said, [...] "We are playing an edited version because some members of the audience might find it offensive". Later that evening Radio 1 backed <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that after a day of criticism from listeners, the band, and MacColl's mother, they reversed the decision. The unedited version was then played later on that day. Other BBC radio stations, including the traditionally more conservative Radio 2, had continued to play the original version throughout this period, the ban having applied to Radio 1 only. The MTV channels in the UK also removed and scrambled the words [...] "slut", [...] "faggot" [...] and [...] "arse" [...] from the song.|$|E

The Mishnah taught that [...] required the passer-by to unload the animal, but not to reload it. But Rabbi Simeon said that [...] required the passer-by to load it too.

2500|$|In 1950, the spinners Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine had confounded the England batsmen to {{give the}} West Indies a 3–1 series win. Ramadhin still exerted his hold, taking 7/49 to dismiss England for 186 in the first innings of the First Test at Edgbaston. The West Indies made 474 and Cowdrey joined Peter May at 113/3 in the second innings, still 175 runs behind. May wrote of Cowdrey's [...] "steadying {{influence}} on me when I was charging down the wicket and trying to hit everyone into the car park. I recall he calmed me <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> occupation of the crease was the vital requirement!" [...] Cowdrey ruthlessly padded away any ball from Ramadhin outside off stump, where {{he could not be}} given out leg before wicket. [...] "It was typical of Cowdrey that he should work out the theory so punctiliously", but his tactic became popular with less talented batsmen to the complaints of purists and detriment of the game. May made 285 not out and Cowdrey 154, his first Test century in England, and together they added 411 runs in 511 minutes, the third highest stand in Test cricket at the time, the highest for the fourth wicket until 2009, the highest stand ever made for England and the highest stand against the West Indies by any team.|$|E

I believe he will not deceive me." [...] The following day, Sun Ce hosted a banquet and had a pole erected in the middle, so as to keep track of time by observing its shadow. By midday, when the shadow was shortest, Taishi Ci returned as promised. Sun Ce was overjoyed. He often consulted Taishi Ci on military affairs later on.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E
