Northern blot analysis showed a significant <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>FAT</b> mRNA in the epithelial layer of circumvallate papillae.

Vpr-induced cell cycle dysregulation and apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells are important components of the pathogenesis of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). FAT 10 is a ubiquitin-like protein that is upregulated in renal tubular epithelial cells in HIVAN. In these studies, we report that Vpr induces increased <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>FAT</b> 10 in tubular cells and that inhibition of FAT 10 expression prevents Vpr-induced apoptosis in human and murine tubular cells. Moreover, we found that Vpr interacts with FAT 10 and that these proteins colocalize at mitochondria. These studies establish FAT 10 as a novel mediator of Vpr-induced cell death...|$|E

The present study evaluated the ameliorative effect of extract of Psoralea corylifolia L. seed (PCS) on high fat diet-induced NAFLD in C 57 BL/ 6 mice after daily administration at 300 or 500 mg/kg for 12 weeks. Treatment with PCS extract significantly reduced body weight and blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. In addition, PCS extract treatment significantly attenuated lipid accumulation in liver and adipose tissue and reduced serum lipid and hepatic triglyceride levels. Furthermore, the expression of lipogenic genes and inflammatory genes were reduced, and the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> oxidation-related genes was increased in the liver of PCS extract-treated mice compared with control mice. Our study suggests the therapeutic potential of PCS extract for NAFLD by inhibiting lipid accumulation and inflammation in liver...|$|E

40|$|The orphan nuclear {{receptor}} chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII; Nr 2 f 2) {{is expressed}} in adipose tissue in vivo and declines during differentiation. Overexpression of COUP-TFII prevents adipogenesis, whereas shRNA-mediated reduction of COUP-TFII promotes differentiation, as shown by increased lipid accumulation and elevated <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> cell marker proteins. Furthermore, reduction of COUP-TFII allows uncommitted fibroblasts to be differentiated into fat cells. COUP-TFII represses {{the expression of a}} number of proadipogenic factors in adipocytes, with direct action noted at the CAAT enhancer-binding protein α promoter. We show that COUP-TFII acts downstream of hedgehog signaling and is required for the full antiadipogenic effect of this pathway. This effect is mediated in part by interaction with GATA factors. COUP-TFII and GATA 2 are physically associated and repress target gene expression in an additive manner. Taken together, our data demonstrate that COUP-TFII represents an endogenous suppressor of adipogenesis, linking antiadipogenic extracellular signals to the core transcriptional cascade...|$|E
40|$|Pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IFN-γ (TI), play {{important}} yet diverse {{roles in}} cell survival, proliferation, and death. Recent evidence highlights FAT 10 as a downstream molecule in the pathway of inflammation-induced tumorigenesis through mediating {{the effect of}} cytokines in causing numerical CIN and protecting cells from cytokines-induced cell death. cDNA microarray analysis of cells treated with TI revealed 493 deregulated genes with FAT 10 being the most up-regulated (85. 7 -fold) gene and NF-κB being the key nodal hub of TI-response genes. Silibinin {{is reported to be}} a powerful antioxidant and has anti-C effects against various carcinomas by affecting various signaling molecules/pathways including MAPK, NF-κB and STATs. As NF-κB signaling pathway is a major mediator of the tumor-promoting activities of TI, we thus examine the effects of silibinin on TI-induced FAT 10 expression and CIN. Our data showed that silibinin inhibited <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>FAT</b> 10, TI-induced chromosome instability (CIN) as well as sensitizes cells to TI-induced apoptosis. Significantly, silibinin suppressed intra-tumorally injected TNF-α-induced tumor growth.

40|$|The Hippo pathway is {{emerging}} as a critical nexus that balances self-renewal of progenitors against differentiation; however, upstream elements in vertebrate Hippo signalling are poorly understood. High <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fat</b> 1 cadherin within the developing neuroepithelium and the manifestation of severe neurological phenotypes in Fat 1 -knockout mice suggest roles in neurogenesis. Using the SH-SY 5 Y model of neuronal differentiation and employing gene silencing techniques, we show that FAT 1 acts to control neurite outgrowth, also driving cells towards terminal differentiation via inhibitory effects on proliferation. FAT 1 actions were shown to be mediated through Hippo signalling where it activated core Hippo kinase components and antagonised functions of the Hippo effector TAZ. Suppression of FAT 1 promoted the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of TAZ leading to enhanced transcription of the Hippo target gene CTGF together with accompanying increases in nuclear levels of Smad 3. Silencing of TAZ reversed the effects of FAT 1 depletion thus connecting inactivation of TAZ-TGFbeta signalling with Hippo signalling mediated through FAT 1. These findings establish FAT 1 as a new upstream Hippo element regulating early stages of differentiation in neuronal cells...|$|E

40|$|Many homeostatic processes, {{including}} {{appetite and}} food intake, {{are controlled by}} neuroendocrine circuits involving the CNS. The CNS also directly regulates adipocyte metabolism, as we have shown here by examining central action of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin. Chronic central ghrelin infusion resulted in increases in the glucose utilization rate of white and brown adipose tissue without affecting skeletal muscle. In white adipocytes, mRNA <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> various <b>fat</b> storage–promoting enzymes such as lipoprotein lipase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase α, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase– 1 was markedly increased, while that of the rate-limiting step in fat oxidation, carnitine palmitoyl transferase– 1 α, was decreased. In brown adipocytes, central ghrelin infusion resulted in lowered <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the thermogenesis-related mitochondrial uncoupling proteins 1 and 3. These ghrelin effects were dose dependent, occurred independently from ghrelin-induced hyperphagia, {{and seemed to be}} mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. Additionally, the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> some <b>fat</b> storage enzymes was decreased in ghrelin-deficient mice, which led us to conclude that central ghrelin is of physiological relevance in the control of cell metabolism in adipose tissue.

It is argued that muscle development and total carcase fatness play the primary role in determining the degree to which intramuscular fat accumulates. In older animals such as mature ewes, fat turnover is also likely to exert a significant influence. The elusive target is to influence partitioning <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> between different fat depots.

Recent {{studies showed that}} human Fat 2 was expressed at squamous cell carcinoma and mammal fat cadherins related to tumor. It is possible to speculate that Fat 2 relate skin tumors. Canine skin tumor {{is one of the}} most common diseases and some skin tumors like melanoma are devastating. Therefore, many kinds of investigation about skin tumor are necessary for a certain and prompt diagnosis and prediction. We investigated the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fat</b> 1 and Fat 2 mRNA in canine skin biopsies by RT-PCR. Samples of skin tissue were obtained from five healthy dogs and skin tumors of nine dogs from private veterinary hospital (Kitasuma Animal Hospital and Matsuoka Animal Hospital). Fat 2 mRNA was not expressed in normal canine skin. However, we found that canine Fat 2 mRNA was expressed in six of nine (67 %) canine skin tumors. On the other hand, canine Fat 1 mRNA was not detected in canine normal skin and skin tumors. These results indicate that Fat 2 might relate to skin tumors in dogs. The further study of Fat 2 in dog might be important for clarifying the mechanism of skin tumors and developing the treatment...|$|E

Previously, the altered <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fat</b> 1 cadherin has been implicated {{in a number of}} solid tumors. In this report, in vitro analysis shows that Fat 1 protein is expressed by a range of leukemia cell lines, but not by normal peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cells from healthy donors. In silico analysis of expression of array data from clinical leukemias found significant levels of Fat 1 transcript in 11 % of acute myeloid leukemia, 29 % and 63 % of ALL of B and T lineages, respectively, and little or no transcript present in normal PB or BM. Furthermore, in two independent studies of matched diagnosis–relapse of precursor B-cell (preB) ALL pediatric samples (n= 32 and n= 27), the level of Fat 1 mRNA expression was prognostic at the time of diagnosis. High Fat 1 mRNA expression was predictive of shorter relapse-free and overall survival, independent of other traditional prognostic markers, including white blood cell count, sex and age. The data presented demonstrate that Fat 1 expression in preB-ALL has a role in the emergence of relapse and could provide a suitable therapeutic target in high-risk preB-ALL...|$|E
40|$|The FAT 10 gene encodes a diubiquitin-like protein {{containing}} two tandem head-to-tail ubiquitin-like domains. There is a {{high degree}} of similarity between murine and human FAT 10 sequences at both the mRNA and protein levels. In various cell lines, FAT 10 expression was shown to be induced by gamma interferon or by tumor necrosis factor alpha. In addition, FAT 10 expression was found to be up-regulated in some Epstein-Barr virus-infected B-cell lines, in activated dendritic cells, and in several epithelial tumors. However, forced <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>FAT</b> 10 in cultured cells was also found to produce apoptotic cell death. Overall, these findings suggest that FAT 10 may modulate cellular growth or cellular viability. Here we describe the steps to generate, by genetic targeting, a FAT 10 gene knockout mouse model. The FAT 10 knockout homozygous mice are viable and fertile. No gross lesions or obvious histological differences were found in these mutated mice. Examination of lymphocyte populations from spleen, thymus, and bone marrow did not reveal any abnormalities. However, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the lymphocytes of FAT 10 knockout mice were, on average, more prone to spontaneous apoptotic death. Physiologically, these mice demonstrated a high level of sensitivity toward endotoxin challenge. These findings indicate that FAT 10 may function as a survival factor...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe Fat pathway {{controls}} both planar cell polarity (PCP) and organ growth [1, 2]. Fat signaling {{is regulated}} by the graded <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Fat</b> ligand Dachsous (Ds) and the cadherin-domain kinase Four-jointed (Fj). The vectors of these gradients influence PCP [1], whereas their slope can influence growth [3, 4]. The Fj and Ds gradients direct the polarized membrane localization of the myosin Dachs, which is a crucial downstream component <b>of</b> <b>Fat</b> signaling [5 – 7]. Here we show that repolarization of Dachs by differential <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> Fj or Ds can propagate through the wing disc, which indicates that Fj and Ds gradients can be measured over long range. Through characterization of tagged genomic constructs, we show that Ds and Fat are themselves partially polarized along the endogenous Fj and Ds gradients, providing a mechanism for propagation of PCP within the Fat pathway. We also identify a biochemical mechanism that might contribute to this polarization by showing that Ds is subject to endoproteolytic cleavage and that the relative levels of Ds isoforms are modulated by Fat...|$|R

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator- 1 α (PGC- 1 α) plays an important role during brown fat development. However, the potential roles of PGC- 1 α in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and the differentiation of iPSCs are still unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of adenovirus-mediated PGC- 1 α overexpression in 3 -gene iPSCs. PGC- 1 α overexpression resulted in increased mitochondrial mass, reactive oxygen species production, and oxygen consumption. Microarray-based bioinformatics showed that the gene <b>expression</b> pattern <b>of</b> PGC- 1 α-overexpressing 3 -gene iPSCs resembled the expression pattern observed in adipocytes. Furthermore, PGC- 1 α overexpression enhanced adipogenic differentiation and the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> several brown <b>fat</b> markers, including uncoupling protein- 1, cytochrome C, and nuclear respiratory factor- 1, whereas it inhibited the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the white <b>fat</b> marker uncoupling protein- 2.

This study investigated whether phyllodulcin could improve metabolic abnormalities in high-fat diet (HFD) -induced obese mice. Animals were fed a 60 % HFD for 6 weeks to induce obesity, followed by 7 weeks of supplementation with phyllodulcin (20 or 40 mg/kg body weight (b. w.) /day). Stevioside (40 mg/kg b. w. /day) {{was used as a}} positive control. Phyllodulcin supplementation reduced subcutaneous fat mass, levels of plasma lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and improved the levels of leptin, adiponectin, and fasting blood glucose. In subcutaneous fat tissues, supplementation with stevioside or phyllodulcin significantly decreased mRNA expression of lipogenesis-related genes, including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein- 1 C (SREBP- 1 c) compared to the high-fat group. Phyllodulcin supplementation significantly increased the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> browning-related genes, including PR domain containing 16 (Prdm 16), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 -α (PGC- 1 α), compared to the high-fat group. Hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor-tropomyosin receptor kinase B (BDNF-TrkB) signaling was upregulated by phyllodulcin supplementation.

40|$|Adipose tissues {{constitute}} {{an important component}} of metabolism, the dysfunction of which can cause obesity and type II diabetes. Here we show that differentiation of white and brown adipocytes requires Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 (DLC 1), a Rho GTPase Activating Protein (RhoGAP) previously studied for its function in liver cancer. We identified Dlc 1 as a super-enhancer associated gene in both white and brown adipocytes through analyzing the genome-wide binding profiles of PPARγ, the master regulator of adipogenesis. We further observed that Dlc 1 expression increases during differentiation, and knockdown of Dlc 1 by siRNA in white adipocytes reduces the formation of lipid droplets and the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> marker genes. Moreover, knockdown of Dlc 1 in brown adipocytes reduces expression of brown fat-specific genes and diminishes mitochondrial respiration. Dlc 1 -/- knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts show a complete inability to differentiate into adipocytes, but this phenotype can be rescued by inhibitors of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and filamentous actin (F-actin), suggesting the involvement of Rho pathway in DLC 1 -regulated adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, PPARγ binds to the promoter of Dlc 1 gene to regulate its expression during both white and brown adipocyte differentiation. These results identify DLC 1 as an activator of white and brown adipocyte differentiation, and provide a molecular link between PPARγ and Rho pathways...|$|E

The total PhA did not significantly change in the middle of the competition but was significantly reduced at the end. The arm PhA did not change significantly at both times of the competition, whereas a significant reduction was reported for leg PhA in the middle and at the end of the competition.

The spray-drying technique and process conditions selected were effective in microencapsulating and stabilizing the flavonoids content giving satisfactory encapsulation efficiency, product yield, morphology and enteric release [...] Conclusion: This approach might be suitable for delivering natural bioactive extract such as Citrus Aurantium, avoiding gastric degradation of the molecule and improving its bioavailability from solid oral dosage forms...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the hallmark neurological manifestations of Huntington's disease (HD), weight loss with metabolic dysfunction is often observed in the later stages of disease progression and is associated with poor prognosis. The mechanism for weight loss in HD is unknown. Using two mouse models of HD, the R 6 / 2 transgenic and CAG 140 knock-in mouse strains, we demonstrate that adipose tissue dysfunction is detectable at early ages and becomes more pronounced as the disease progresses. Adipocytes acquire a ‘de-differentiated’ phenotype characterized by impaired <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> storage genes. In addition, HD mice exhibit reduced levels of leptin and adiponectin, adipose tissue-derived hormones that regulate food intake and glucose metabolism. Importantly, some of these changes occur prior to weight loss and development {{of some of the}} characteristic neurological symptoms. We demonstrate that impaired gene expression and lipid accumulation in adipocytes can be recapitulated by expression of an inducible mutant huntingtin transgene in an adipocyte cell line and that mutant huntingtin inhibits transcriptional activity of the PGC- 1 α co-activator in adipocytes, which may contribute to aberrant gene expression. Thus, our findings indicate that mutant huntingtin has direct detrimental effects in cell types other than neurons. The results also indicate that circulating adipose-tissue-derived hormones may be accessible markers for HD prognosis and progression and suggest that adipose tissue may be a useful therapeutic target to improve standard of life for HD patients...|$|E

The current study investigated the effects of fetal growth restriction induced by MH during {{the last half of}} gestation on bone structure and volume in the offspring of the fetus near term and the pup in adolescence. Methods. During 35 - 62 -day gestation (term, 69 d), guinea pigs were housed in room air (21 % O 2; control) or 12 % O 2 (MH). Offspring femur and tibia were collected at 62 d gestation and 120 d after birth. Results. MH decreased fetal birth weight but did not affect osteogenic potential pools in the fetal bone marrow. Histological analysis showed no effects of MH on tibial growth plate thickness in either fetal or postnatal offspring, although there was increased VEGF mRNA expression in the growth plate of postnatal offspring. MH did not change primary spongiosa height but lowered collagen- 1 mRNA expression in postnatal offspring. There was increased mRNA expression of adipogenesis-related gene (FABP 4) in bone from the MH postnatal offspring. Conclusion. MH during late gestation did not change the pool of osteogenic cells before birth or growth plate heights before and after birth.

The present study investigated the anti-obesity/anti-diabetic effects of AP using obese diabetic KKAy mice. KKAy mice received either normal diet, high-fat diet or high-fat diet with additional AP for 7 weeks. After the end of administration, body weight, plasma glucose and insulin were measured. Furthermore, mRNA and protein expression of obesity/diabetic suppression-related genes were measured in skeletal muscle, liver and white adipose tissue. As a result, compared to the high-fat diet group, increases in body weight, plasma glucose and insulin were significantly suppressed for AP groups. Furthermore, compared to the high-fat diet group, mRNA expression of energy expenditure-related genes (PPARα, PPARδ, CPT 1, ACO and UCP 3) was significantly higher for AP groups in skeletal muscle. Protein expressions of CPT 1, ACO and UCP 3 for AP groups were also significantly higher {{when compared to the}} high-fat diet group. Moreover, AP lowered the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> acid synthesis-related genes (SREBP- 1 c, ACC and FAS) in the liver. AP also increased mRNA expression of adiponectin and decreased expression of TNF-α in white adipose tissue. In conclusion, the anti-obesity actions of AP are considered attributable to increased expression of energy expenditure-related genes in skeletal muscle, and decreased fatty acid synthesis and fat intake in the liver. These results suggest that AP {{is expected to be a}} useful plant extract for alleviating metabolic syndrome...|$|E

A role of ghrelin {{in the regulation}} of lipid and energy metabolism is suggested by fat gain independent of changes in food intake during exogenous ghrelin administration in rodents. We investigated the potential effects of peripheral ghrelin administration (two times daily 200 -micrograms [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] sc injection for 4 days) on triglyceride content and mitochondrial and lipid metabolism gene expression in rat liver and muscles. Compared with vehicle, ghrelin increased body weight but not food intake and circulating insulin. In liver, ghrelin induced a lipogenic and glucogenic pattern of gene expression and increased triglyceride content while reducing activated (phosphorylated) stimulator of fatty acid oxidation, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK, all P < 0. 05), with unchanged mitochondrial oxidative enzyme activities. In contrast, triglyceride content was reduced (P < 0. 05) after ghrelin administration in mixed (gastrocnemius) and unchanged in oxidative (soleus) muscle. In mixed muscle, ghrelin increased (P < 0. 05) mitochondrial oxidative enzyme activities independent of changes in <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> metabolism genes and phosphorylated AMPK. Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, the activation of which reduces muscle fat content, was selectively increased in mixed muscle where it paralleled changes in oxidative capacities (P < 0. 05). Thus ghrelin induces tissue-specific changes in mitochondrial and lipid metabolism gene expression and favors triglyceride deposition in liver over skeletal muscle. These novel effects of ghrelin in the regulation of lean tissue fat distribution and metabolism could contribute to metabolic adaptation to caloric restriction and loss of body fat...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{determine}} the effect of supplementing purebred and crossbred weaner lambs with Spirulina on fatty acid composition and the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> metabolism and lipogenesis related genes in the muscle, adipose, liver, heart and kidney organs. The transcription levels of Aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), Adrenergic beta- 3 receptor (ADRB 3), B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG 2) and Fatty acid synthase (FASN) genes provided consistent evidence that 10 % dietary supplementation with Spirulina increased prime lamb growth and meat quality through heavier liveweights, longer body lengths (BL) and enhanced polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) compositions under pasture-fed management. Under simulated drought conditions when sheep lose weight and body condition, supplementation with Spirulina compensated for weight loss and sequestrated for sheep production losses. The transcription levels of AANAT, ADRB 3, BTG 2 and FASN genes under simulated drought conditions assisted in shedding light on the underlying biological mechanisms at the molecular level; significant increases in n- 3 and n- 6 fatty acids were observed in lambs supplemented with 10 % Spirulina indicating a positive impact on meat quality performance. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) study was carried out {{to determine the effect}} of ADRB 3 gene mutations on the growth performance of purebred and crossbred sheep. SNP analyses revealed that Black Suffolk breed was less mutated compared to other breeds resulting in higher liveweight and an improved PUFA profile. Taken together, these results suggest that in crossbred sheep production, supplementation with Spirulina, a linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) rich diet induced SFA depression and an increase in PUFA...|$|E
40|$|Background: 3 T 3 -L 1 {{cells are}} widely used to study adipogenesis and insulin response. Their adipogenic {{potential}} decreases with time in the culture. Expressing exogenous genes in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells can be challenging. This work tries to establish and characterize an alternative model of cultured adipocytes that is easier to work with than the 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: Induced cells were identified as adipocytes based on the following three characteristics: (1) Accumulation of triglyceride droplets as demonstrated by oil red O stain. (2) Transport rate of 2 -deoxyglucose increased after insulin stimulation. (3) <b>Expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> specific genes such as Fabp 4 (aP 2), Slc 2 a 4 (Glut 4) and Pparg (PPARc). Among the cell lines induced under different conditions in this study, only NIH/ 3 T 3 cells differentiated into adipocytes after prolonged incubation in 3 T 3 -L 1 induction medium containing 20 % instead of 10 % fetal bovine serum. Rosiglitazone added to the induction medium shortened the incubation period from 14 to 7 days. The PI 3 K/AKT pathway showed similar changes upon insulin stimulation in these two adipocytes. C/EBPa mRNA was barely detectable in NIH/ 3 T 3 adipocytes. NIH/ 3 T 3 adipocytes induced {{in the presence of}} rosiglitazone showed higher 2 -deoxyglucose transport rate after insulin stimulation, expressed less Agt (angiotensinogen) and more PPARc. Knockdown of C/EBPa using shRNA blocked 3 T 3 -L 1 but not NIH/ 3 T 3 cell differentiation. Mouse adipose tissues from various anatomical locations showed comparable levels of C/ EBPa mRNA...|$|E

Currently, platinum-based chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin and carboplatin, are the most effective treatment for NSCLC. However, the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy is markedly reduced later in the treatment because drug resistance develops during the treatment. Recently, a series of studies has suggested the involvement <b>of</b> <b>FAT</b> 10 in the development and malignancy of multiple cancer types. In this study, we focused our research on the function <b>of</b> <b>FAT</b> 10 in NSCLC, which has not been previously reported in the literature. We found that the <b>expression</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>FAT</b> 10 were elevated in quick chemoresistance NSCLC tissues, and we demonstrated that FAT 10 promotes NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, the protein levels <b>of</b> <b>FAT</b> 10 were elevated in cisplatin- and carboplatin-resistant NSCLC cells, and knockdown <b>of</b> <b>FAT</b> 10 reduced the drug resistance of NSCLC cells. In addition, we gained evidence that FAT 10 regulates NSCLC malignancy and drug resistance by modulating the activity of the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway.

40|$|Consumption of Pu-erh {{has been}} {{reported}} to result in numerous health benefits, but the mechanisms underlying purported weight-loss and lowering of lipid are poorly understood. Here, we used the nematode Caenorhaditis elegans to explore the water extract of Pu-erh tea (PTE) functions to reduce fat storage. We found that PTE down-regulates the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the master <b>fat</b> regulator SBP- 1, a homologue of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) and its target stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), a key enzyme in fat biosynthesis, leading to an increased ratio of stearic acid (C 18 : 0) to oleic acid (C 18 : 1 n- 9), and subsequently decreased fat storage. We also found that both the pharyngeal pumping rate and food uptake of C. elegans decreased with exposure to PTE. Collectively, these results provide an experimental basis for explaining the ability of Pu-erh tea in promoting inhibition of food uptake and the biosynthesis <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> via SBP- 1 and SCD, thereby reducing fat storage...|$|R

The total absence of staining with HMFG 1 was possibly associated with a favourable outcome, although this did not quite achieve significance with the small numbers involved.
