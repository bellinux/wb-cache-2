5|$|The ice trade {{enabled the}} {{consumption}} {{of a wide range}} of new products during the 19th century. One simple use for natural ice was to chill drinks, either being directly added to the glass or barrel, or indirectly chilling it in a wine cooler or similar container. Iced drinks were a novelty and were initially viewed with concern by customers, worried about the health risks, although this rapidly vanished in the US. By mid-19th century, water was always chilled in America if possible. Iced milk also popular, and German lager, traditionally drunk chilled, also used ice. Drinks such as sherry-cobblers and mint juleps were created that could only be made using crushed ice. There were distinct differences in 19th-century American and European attitudes to adding ice directly to drinks, with the Europeans regarding this as an unpleasant habit; British visitors to India were surprised to see the Anglo-Indian elite prepared to drink <b>iced</b> <b>water.</b> Some Hindus in India regarded ice as unclean for religious reasons, and as such an inappropriate food.|$|E

25|$|An older {{method of}} {{harvesting}} {{is to use}} a sweep net, which operates a bit like a purse seine net. The sweep net is a big net with weights along the bottom edge. It is stretched across the pen with the bottom edge extending {{to the bottom of the}} pen. Lines attached to the bottom corners are raised, herding some fish into the purse, where they are netted. Before killing, the fish are usually rendered unconscious in water saturated in carbon dioxide, although this practice is being phased out in some countries due to ethical and product quality concerns. More advanced systems use a percussive-stun harvest system that kills the fish instantly and humanely with a blow to the head from a pneumatic piston. They are then bled by cutting the gill arches and immediately immersing them in <b>iced</b> <b>water.</b> Harvesting and killing methods are designed to minimise scale loss, and avoid the fish releasing stress hormones, which negatively affect flesh quality.|$|E

40|$|The optical {{properties}} of ice clouds are a primary issue for climate and climate change. Evaluating these {{optical properties}} in three-dimensional models for studying climate {{will require a}} method to calculate the <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> content of such clouds. A procedure is developed to parameterize <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> content {{as a function of}} large-scale meteorological characteristics for use in circulation models in which the <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> content is not calculated by means of a three-dimensional prognostic equation for condensed water. The technique identifies large-scale flows in which ice clouds exist and calculates their <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> content by reconstructing the trajectory associated with cloud formation. As the cloud forms, its ice content changes both by deposition of <b>ice</b> from <b>water</b> vapor and by ice removal by sedimentation. The sedimentation process is found to modify significantly the <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> content expected from deposition alone. <b>Ice</b> <b>water</b> contents predicted by the parameterization are compared with aircraft observations collected in the middle latitudes and the tropics, and show reasonable agreement over four orders-of-magnitude of <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> content. A parameterization for the sublimation of ice crystals settling into ice-subsaturated environments is also presented...|$|R

2500|$|In 19th century Parisian cafés, upon {{receiving}} {{an order for}} an absinthe, a waiter would present the patron with a dose of absinthe in a suitable glass, sugar, absinthe spoon, and a carafe of <b>iced</b> <b>water.</b> It {{was up to the}} patron to prepare the drink, as the inclusion or omission of sugar was strictly an individual preference, as was the amount of water used. [...] As the popularity of the drink increased, additional accoutrements of preparation appeared, including the absinthe fountain, which was effectively a large jar of <b>iced</b> <b>water</b> with spigots, mounted on a lamp base. This let drinkers prepare a number of drinks at once—and with a hands-free drip, patrons could socialise while louching a glass.|$|E

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{athletic}} training, <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> immersion is a commonly used therapeutic intervention when dealing with the {{signs and symptoms of}} delayed onset muscle soreness. These signs and symptoms include pain, swelling, stiffness, and reduced force production of the muscle. <b>Ice</b> <b>water</b> immersion, involves submerging an athlete in a tub of <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> up to their waist or neck for a prolonged period of time. <b>Ice</b> <b>water</b> immersion is thought to reduce signs and symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness by limiting the body's acute inflammatory response; however, there is currently no physiological evidence to support these claims. In this critically appraised topic, I will be researching the current literature to find the best evidence on effectiveness of <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> immersion in the treatment of pain and reduced muscle function associated with delayed onset muscle soreness. I will use this evidence to provide a recommendation for current clinical practice and comment on implications for future research. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?...|$|R
50|$|Ice sculptures, ice walls {{for fire}} fighting, {{property}} protection and cooling stations may be cast {{by a process}} in which <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> (one part), crushed ice or ice cubes (three parts) and tiny, floating, dry ice pellets (one part) are placed in a cement mixer. The tiny dry ice pellets super cool the <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> so that the <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> acts like glue to cement or freeze the crushed ice or ice cubes together within several seconds once the mixture stops moving within the mold. The <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> component of the mixture will expand 9% on freezing, so rubber, foam or foam lined casting materials work best to combat the <b>water</b> to <b>ice</b> expansion problem not encountered with wax, cement, casting plaster or metal casting materials.|$|R
40|$|Cloud <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> {{content and}} cloud {{geometrical}} thickness have been determined {{using a combination}} of near-infrared, thermal infrared and thermal microwave radiometric measurements. The radiometric measurements are from a Multispectral Cloud Radiometer, which has seven channels ranging from visible to thermal infrared, and an Advanced Microwave Moisture Sounder, which has four channels ranging from 90 to 183 GHz. Studies indicate that the microwave brightness temperatures depend not only on the amount of <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> content but also on the vertical distribution of <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> content. Studies also show that the low brightness temperature at 92 GHz for large <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> content is due to cloud reflection which reflects most of the irradiance incident at the cloud base downward. Therefore the 92 GHz channel detects a low brightness temperature at the cloud top...|$|R
2500|$|The {{traditional}} French preparation involves {{placing a}} sugar cube {{on top of}} a specially designed slotted spoon, and placing the spoon on a glass filled with a measure of absinthe. <b>Iced</b> <b>water</b> is poured or dripped over the sugar cube to mix the water into the absinthe. The final preparation contains 1 part absinthe and 3-5 parts water. As water dilutes the spirit, those components with poor water solubility (mainly those from anise, fennel, and star anise) come out of solution and cloud the drink. The resulting milky opalescence is called the [...] (Fr. opaque or shady, IPA [...] ). The release of these dissolved essences coincides with a perfuming of herbal aromas and flavours that [...] "blossom" [...] or [...] "bloom," [...] and brings out subtleties that are otherwise muted within the neat spirit. This reflects what is perhaps the oldest and purest method of preparation, and {{is often referred to as}} the French Method.|$|E

40|$|One of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program {{important}} {{goals is}} to develop and test radiation and cloud parameterizations of climate models using single column modeling (SCMs) (Randall et al. 1996). As forcing terms, SCMs need advection tendency of cloud condensates besides the tendencies of temperature, moisture and momentum. To compute the tendency terms of cloud condensates, 3 D distribution of cloud condensates over a scale {{much larger than the}} climate model's grid scale is needed. Since they can cover a large area within a short time period, satellite measurements are useful utilities to provide advection tendency of cloud condensates for SCMs. However, so far, most satellite retrieval algorithms only retrieve vertically integrated quantities, for example, in the case of cloud <b>ice,</b> <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> path (IWP). To fulfill the requirement of 3 D <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> content field for computing <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> advection, in this study, we develop an <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> content profile retrieval algorithm by combining the vertical distribution characteristics obtained from long-term surface radar observations and satellite high-frequency microwave observations that cover a large area. The algorithm is based on the Bayesian theorem using a priori database derived from analyzing cloud radar observations at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) site. The end product of the algorithm is a 3 D <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> content covering 10 {sup o} x 10 {sup o} surrounding the SGP site during the passage of the satellite. This 3 D <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> content, together with wind field analysis, can be used to compute the advection tendency of <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> for SCMs...|$|R
