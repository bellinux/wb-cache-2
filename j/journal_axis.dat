50|$|Piper wrote {{extensively}} on {{modern art in}} books and articles. With his wife Myfanwy Piper he founded the contemporary art <b>journal</b> <b>Axis.</b> From 1946 until 1954, Piper served as a trustee of the Tate gallery. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s he would regularly spend time painting in Pembrokeshire. He was a theatre set designer, including for the Kenton Theatre in Henley. He designed many of the premiere productions of Benjamin Britten's operas at Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Royal Opera House, La Fenice and the Aldeburgh Festival, {{as well as for}} some of the operas of Alun Hoddinott. Piper also designed firework displays, most notably for the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 1977.|$|E
40|$|A finite-element {{approach}} to thermoelastohydrodynamic lubrication analysis is developed by extending a previous mass- and energy-conserving algorithm to include wall-convection boundary conditions, groove-mixing theory, and thermo-mechanical deformations. To this end, the cross-film-averaged energy equation is {{coupled with the}} heat conduction equations relevant to the bearing sleeve and the journal by fitting the temperature profile across the film thickness with a fourth-order polynomial. A finite-element condensation technique is used to reduce the unknowns in heat conduction equations in the bush and in the journal to the temperatures of the sleeve surface and <b>journal</b> <b>axis,</b> respectively. Applied {{to the analysis of}} steadily loaded journal bearings, the proposed method shows good agreement with published experimental results and incurs low computational cost...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a survey {{conducted}} on an experimental system consisting of a rigid rotor supported on two radial bearings each with five tilting pads is presented. In particular, the system {{was set up in}} order to assess the dynamic behaviour of the bearing in unusual operating conditions. The response of the bearing to different unbalance values was determined after acquiring and analysing the orbits described by the <b>journal</b> <b>axis</b> for assigned unbalance values in different operating conditions. Analysis of the results shows some particular operating features that were not entirely predicted by the theoretical model and which may give rise to malfunctions in the rotor-tilting pad bearings system. The tests were carried out in the rotor dynamics laboratory of the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Meccanica per l'Energetica at the University of Naples...|$|E

We applied this approach to discrete kinematics analysis of upper cervical spine (UCS) during axial rotation (AR) and flexion extension (FE) to create anatomical models with movement simulation including helical <b>axis.</b> <b>Journal</b> ArticleValidation StudiesSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{collector}} dish is continuously {{oriented toward}} the sun in a system adapted to perform both diurnal and seasonal solar tracking. The mount {{is characterized by a}} rigid, angulated axle having a linear midportion supporting a collector dish, and oppositely extended end portions normally related to the midportion of the axle and received in spaced <b>journals.</b> The longitudinal <b>axis</b> of symmetry for the midportion of the axle is coincident with a seasonal axis while the axes of the journals are coincident with a diurnal axis paralleling the earth's polar axis. Drive means are provided for periodically displacing the axle about the diurnal axis at a substantially constant rate, while other drive means are provided for periodically indexing the dish through 1 deg about the seasonal axis whereby the position of the dish relative to the axle is varied for accommodating seasonal tracking as changes in the angle of inclination of the polar axis occurs...|$|R
40|$|When a {{force is}} applied on a {{hydrodynamic}} journal bearing of combustion engines under operating conditions, the <b>journal</b> <b>axis</b> moves with relation to the bearing center. This displacement can {{be determined by the}} eccentricity factor c and the attitude angle alpha. Initially, it is necessary to calculate the dynamic forces that act on the bearing during actual operation. Based on the force and the bearing characteristics, it is then possible to design and implement a mathematical algorithm that calculates the journal orbit {{as a function of the}} crank angle. The algorithm is based on the solution of an algebraic system of force equilibrium under transient state. The hydrodynamic force at each time step is obtained by the solution of the Reynolds equation via the Finite Element Method. This paper analyzes the journal orbit of combustion engine bearings using the Newton-Euler and the traditional pseudo-dynamics approaches for the load calculation...|$|E
40|$|Multilobe journal {{bearings}} operate at high speeds, low or medium external loads and at small eccentricities. These high performance bearings find the application in the responsible rotating machinery as the steam and gas turbines, turbochargers or turbo compressors. Excellent operating properties and reliable design of multilobe {{journal bearings}} {{can be achieved}} by calculation of static and dynamic characteristics and the correct choice of bearing geometry, bearing material, and lubricant. Static characteristics of bearing include the oil film pressure and temperature distributions, minimum oil film thickness, power loss, oil flow, maximum oil film temperature. Dynamic characteristics are determined by four stiffness and damping coefficients of oil film. The paper introduces the calculation of static and dynamic characteristics of multilobe journal bearings which are applied in the high speed rotating machinery. Reynolds, energy, viscosity and geometry equations were solved on the assumptions of thermo-hydrodynamic theory of lubrication. Aligned orientation of bearing and <b>journal</b> <b>axis</b> without deflections was assumed...|$|E
