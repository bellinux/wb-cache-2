25|$|A fiduciary, {{such as the}} administrator, {{executor}} or {{guardian of}} an estate, may be legally required to file with a probate court or judge a surety bond, called a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>bond</b> or probate bond, to guarantee faithful performance of his duties. One of those duties may be to prepare, generally under oath, an inventory of the tangible or intangible property of the estate, describing the items or classes of property and usually placing a valuation on them.|$|E

25|$|Court {{bonds are}} those bonds {{prescribed}} by statute and {{relate to the}} courts. They are further broken down into judicial <b>bonds</b> and <b>fiduciary</b> <b>bonds.</b> Judicial bonds arise out of litigation and are posted by parties seeking court remedies or defending against legal actions seeking court remedies. <b>Fiduciary,</b> or probate, <b>bonds</b> are filed in probate courts and courts that exercise equitable jurisdiction; they guaranty that persons whom such courts have entrusted with the care of others’ property will perform their specified duties faithfully.|$|R

Post-market surveillance {{has emerged as a}} potential policy tool to address food safety concerns. This manuscript develops a framework for analyzing four stylized approaches to food safety; direct regulation, post market surveillance, legal liability and bonding/branding. The paper challenges each of the four policies with characteristics that pose risks to a modern food system; dynamic complexity, acute immeasurability, and non-trivial harm. Important results of the model differentiate with respect to food safety; ex-ante versus ex-post policies, direct versus indirect approaches, Europe’s precautionary principle and the US’s liability framework, and Type I and Type II errors. Results suggest that all four policies have weaknesses, but <b>fiduciary</b> <b>bonding</b> as a policy to mitigate risk may justify more attention...|$|R
