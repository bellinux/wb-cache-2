25|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} regeneration or renewal {{was that the}} Doctor's body would rebuild itself in a younger, healthier form. The Second Doctor {{was intended to be}} a literally younger version of the First; biological time would turn back, and several hundred years would <b>get</b> <b>taken</b> off the Doctor's age, rejuvenating him. In practice, however, since the Doctor stated his age in the Second Doctor serial The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967), his age has been recorded progressively (see below). In six out of ten transitions, the new actor was younger than his predecessor had been when he began the role. In the revived programme, the pattern is resumed with the transition of the Ninth to the Tenth and the Tenth to the Eleventh Doctor, although Steven Moffat is on record stating the intention was to cast an actor in his mid-30s to 40s for the role of the Eleventh Doctor, despite casting Matt Smith, who is the youngest actor to ever have played the role.|$|E
500|$|Morley {{concludes that}} [...] "Anti-rockism was always violently pro-pop, largely because we {{original}} campaigning anti-rockists {{had been given}} such a tough time at school for liking [...] Bowie and [...] Bolan and not ELP and Led Zep." [...] Regarding the definition, music writer Ned Raggett noted: [...] "Every article, every discussion, anything which involves the word seems to get bogged down or <b>get</b> <b>taken</b> apart in ways which prevent there from being any consensus." [...] Accordingly, some people have used rockism as a polemical label to identify and critique a cluster of beliefs and assumptions in music criticism. Rockism is therefore not a connotatively neutral term, according to Raggett: [...] "You’re {{not going to find}} anyone arguing FOR [...] any time soon, or at least coming out and saying sobut that’s precisely because of the terms of the discourse." [...] Popmatters Robert Loss wrote that [...] "traditionalism" [...] describes the policing of the present with the past, making it a better word for [...] "rockism". Design critic and indie pop musician Nick Currie (aka Momus) compared rockism to the international art movement Stuckism, which holds that artists who do not paint or sculpt are not true artists.|$|E
500|$|In 1969, the Revue's {{profile in}} their home country was raised after opening for the Rolling Stones on their US tour. In 1970, they {{performed}} on The Ed Sullivan Show. The tour's success resulted in the Revue signing with Liberty Records, where they released two albums, Come Together and Workin' Together, released in 1970 and 1971 respectively. Come Together produced the duo's first top 40 single with their cover of Sly and the Family Stone's [...] "I Want to Take You Higher." [...] Come Together marked {{a turning point in}} their careers in which they switched from their usual R repertoire to incorporate more rock tunes. In early 1971, their cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's [...] "Proud Mary" [...] became their biggest hit, reaching number 4 on the Hot 100 and selling over a million copies, winning them a Grammy for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group. Later in 1971, their live album, What You Hear Is What You <b>Get,</b> <b>taken</b> from a performance at Carnegie Hall, was their first to be certified gold. In 1972, Ike Turner created the studio, Bolic Sounds, near their home in Inglewood. After Liberty was bought by United Artists Records, the duo was assigned to that label, releasing ten albums in a three-year period. The duo's final major hit single, [...] "Nutbush City Limits", was released in 1973, reaching number 22 on the Hot 100, and peaking at number 4 in the UK. In 1974, Tina released her first solo album, Tina Turns the Country On!, winning a Grammy nomination.|$|E

2500|$|His {{ability to}} {{correctly}} identify the biggest goats {{of a game}} is also widely admired, particularly when contrasted to archrival Russell Hantz's inability to not only keep the respect of a jury as Rob can, but to accurately judge the weakest opponents {{to bring to the}} end as Rob does. [...] However, many fans criticize Rob for his huge advantage in being a four-time player and having no real competition the entire season, giving him perhaps the easiest win in Survivor history. His tribemates were criticized for being too starstruck to act against Rob. Some fans also criticize him for probably having been unable to beat anyone other than his 2 ultimate goats (based upon cast interviews, amongst other indicators). [...] The jury has even indicated Phillip Sheppard could have beaten him had he followed through with his plan to [...] "own his game" [...] and reveal that he had purposely played the villain role to <b>get</b> <b>taken</b> to the end by Rob, and in doing so had duped Rob and his entire alliance. Instead Sheppard was rude, lashed out at Julie Wolfe after she had asked him if his son would be proud of the way he played the game, and gave all the credit to Rob, thus receiving only 1 vote (from Ralph Kiser, the one jury member Phillip showed respect towards at Final Tribal and throughout the game) and giving Rob the easy finish glove side.|$|E
