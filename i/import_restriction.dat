50|$|An {{important}} transformation {{occurred in}} Korea's trade {{policy in the}} sixth five-year plan, which witnessed the change in trend from heavy industry toward export - oriented consumer products, including electronics and high tech. Foreign investment policies were relaxed {{in response to a}} decrease in domestic investment, cross-border capital movement increased significantly. Restrictions on imports were removed, but a variety of non-tariff barriers complicated trade structure. In 1986, Korea for the first time achieved a favorable trade balance, a trade surplus of US$4.2 billion. However the transformations in the trade policy eventually lead to challenges in the 1990s. In 1990's domestic consumption of luxury goods increased including high tech and electronics products which reduced exports which resulted in Korea's trade deficit and current account deficit. In mid-1990's Korea reduced tariff rates and <b>import</b> <b>restriction</b> on autos, high tech products and financial services.|$|E

5000|$|Mongolia {{became a}} member of the International Monetary Fund on February 14th, 1991 with a money of $54 million. Six years after {{becoming}} a member, Mongolia received a $45 million three-year loan from the IMF under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) in 1997. Through this loan and support from IMF, Mongolia began to make economic reforms which included liberalization of wages and prices, allowed a larger mining capacity, a reduction in <b>import</b> <b>restriction,</b> privatization of some state enterprises, the establishment of a commercial banking system, easing of capital controls, and an introduction of a floating exchange rate system. However, even with these progressive steps serious fundamental problems remained, such as a weak banking system, a large and inefficient public sector, a discretionary tax system, and a legal infrastructure that did not support private sector sufficiently. In addition, the progress was stalled in 1998 due to large declines in export prices, spillovers from regional crises, and political problems. Based on the impressive economic growth in the past, the IMF executive board approved Mongolia's Second Annual Program under ESAF. This time they sought to solve the structural problems that remained after the first program under ESAF.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the welfare loss of <b>import</b> <b>restrictions</b> on bananas in Australia {{and whether the}} <b>import</b> <b>restrictions</b> have turned into a particular form of export promotion. We set up a model {{in which there is}} free domestic entry, with banana producers accepting losses in normal years, off-set by large profits in years when cyclones destroy {{a large proportion of the}} banana plants because of sufficiently low elasticity of demand. Using the cyclones of 2006 and 2011 as exogenous events, we identify the elasticity of demand for bananas in Australia to be around - 0. 5. We indeed find limited evidence for an 9 ÃÜ 1 over-shooting 9 ÃÜ 2 in terms of the supply response after these cyclones, leading to positive exports years after cyclones have hit and re-planted banana plants have become productive. Combining the elasticity estimates with information on turnover, we get an estimated welfare loss of 600 million dollars per year due to banana <b>import</b> <b>restrictions...</b>|$|R

They bought the property and named it [...] "Bareacres" [...] after the character Lord Bareacres in Vanity Fair by Thackeray. Lord Bareacres was land-poor; his only asset was his estate. Mary wrote Powell: [...] "God help us ... We've put our last penny into 90 acres of rocks and rattlesnakes." [...] Although Parrish' life at Bareacres had its ups and downs, its course was a downward spiral. He continued to paint, and Powell staged an exhibition of his works.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I test the {{hypothesis}} that trade policies leading to higher prices for capital goods have a negative influence on the steady state level and transitional growth rate of per capita GDP. I derive this hypothesis from {{a modified version of}} a Solow-Swan model, in which capital variety increases productivity. This model has the implication that <b>import</b> <b>restrictions</b> on foreign capital goods reduce the steady state level and the transitional growth rate of per capita GDP. However, although I assume that technological progress spreads over different countries via the import of new capital goods, <b>import</b> <b>restrictions</b> do not reduce the steady state growth rate. A reduction of the steady state growth rate is only possible, if the number of varieties of imported capital goods were restricted. The empirical results show that capital goods prices as well as the relative input ratios of domestic and foreign capital goods are significantly positively affected by the level of import tariffs on capital goods and the coverage ratio of non-tariff measures on capital goods. A test of the steady state version of the Solow-Swan model displays a statistically significant negative relation between <b>import</b> <b>restrictions</b> on foreign capital goods and the level of per capita GDP.
