5|$|After graduation, Holmes {{quickly became}} a <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> the local medical scene by joining the Massachusetts Medical Society, the Boston Medical Society, and the Boston Society for Medical Improvement — an {{organization}} composed of young, Paris-trained doctors. He also gained a greater reputation after winning Harvard Medical School's prestigious Boylston Prize, for which he submitted a paper {{on the benefits of}} using the stethoscope, a device with which many American doctors were not familiar.|$|E
5|$|Clarinets {{were soon}} {{accepted}} into orchestras. Later models had a mellower tone than the originals. Mozart (d. 1791) liked {{the sound of}} the clarinet (he considered its tone the closest in quality to the human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for the instrument., and by the time of Beethoven (c. 1800–1820), the clarinet was a standard <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|In July 1986, Andy Roxburgh was the {{surprise}} appointment {{as the new}} manager of Scotland.

5|$|The {{national}} team's {{record for}} highest-scoring victory was achieved in 2016, a 10–0 result over San Marino. Croatia's worst defeat {{is a joint}} record; the Independent State of Croatia side lost 5–1 to Germany twice in the 1940s. The modern Croatian team also lost to England by the same scoreline in a 2010 World Cup qualifying <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> London.|$|E
5|$|Though Swift quickly {{established}} himself as a <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> the Manchester City first team line-up, his performances were not all positive. In one of his early matches, against West Bromwich Albion, Swift conceded seven goals. This led Swift to believe he would not be picked again, but with Langford unavailable due to a knee injury, Swift kept his place.|$|E

5|$|After {{playing in}} the first two Tests against Pakistan during October, Buttler was dropped for the third Test, {{replaced}} as wicket-keeper by Jonny Bairstow, and was not selected for any of the Test matches during England's tour of South Africa, although he did play again in the one-day fixtures during the tour. Buttler again played for England in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 and was a regular <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> the limited-overs squad throughout the year. He scored an unbeaten 90 runs against Pakistan as part of an England record score of 444/3, the fastest half-century by an Englishman.|$|E
5|$|After the {{cancellation}} of the annual Scotland v England <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> 1989, questions were raised as to whether Scottish football required a separate national stadium. Rangers proposed Ibrox as an alternative venue, while Murrayfield {{was about to be}} redeveloped without public funding. None of these arguments impressed the National Stadium committee, which consisted of the SFA, Scottish Football League and Queen's Park. The West Terrace was converted to seating in 1991 for only £700,000, but this left two terraces and therefore disqualified Hampden from hosting FIFA World Cup qualification matches.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2015–16 season Aston Villa {{had spent}} 105 seasons in the top tier of English {{football}}; the only club to have spent longer in the top flight are Everton, with 114 seasons, making Aston Villa versus Everton the most-played <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> English top-flight football. Aston Villa were relegated in from the top tier of English football in 2016, having played in every Premier League season since its establishment in 1992–93. They are seventh in the All-time FA Premier League table, and have the fifth highest total of major honours won by an English club with 21 wins.|$|E

5|$|Flagstaff {{grew and}} prospered through the 1960s. During the 1970s and 1980s, however, many {{businesses}} {{started to move}} from the city center, and the downtown area entered an economic and social decline. Sears and J.C. Penney left the downtown area in 1979 to open up as anchor stores in the new Flagstaff Mall, joined in 1986 by Dillard's. By 1987, the Babbitt Brothers Trading Company, which had been a retail <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> Flagstaff since 1891, had closed its doors at Aspen Avenue and San Francisco Street.|$|E

He also played in the away <b>fixture,</b> <b>in</b> front of 38,000 spectators. Faced with snowy conditions in Prague, Watford were eliminated 7–2 on aggregate. Gibbs made his first Football League appearances in Watford's final three First Division games of 1983–84, including as a substitute in a 2–1 win over Arsenal. However, he was not selected for the 1984 FA Cup final.|$|E
5|$|Other {{legislation}} {{of importance}} includes the Treason Act of 1351. It {{was precisely the}} harmony of the reign that allowed a consensus on the definition of this controversial crime. Yet the most significant legal reform was probably that concerning the Justices of the Peace. This institution began before the reign of Edward III but, by 1350, the justices {{had been given the}} power not only to investigate crimes and make arrests, but also to try cases, including those of felony. With this, an enduring <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> the administration of local English justice had been created.|$|E

5|$|Still an {{automatic}} choice under new national manager Javier Clemente, Žigić scored the only goal in Serbia's first competitive match {{as a separate}} country, a Euro 2008 qualifier at home to Azerbaijan in September 2006. He scored once, missed two more good chances and was then sent off for elbowing an opponent in stoppage time of the March 2007 qualifying defeat in Kazakhstan, so missed the next, a home draw with Portugal, and also missed the Finland <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> June after surgery on a facial injury. He still scored seven goals as Serbia failed to qualify.|$|E
5|$|The 1998–99 {{season was}} the most {{successful}} season {{in the history of}} Manchester United Football Club. After finishing the previous season without winning any titles, United won a treble of trophies (the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League), the first side in English football to achieve such a feat. During the campaign United lost only five times, including a one-off Charity Shield <b>fixture,</b> <b>in</b> the League Cup against eventual winners Tottenham Hotspur and their only home defeat, a league match against Middlesbrough in December 1998. A run of 33 games unbeaten in all competitions began on 26 December at home to Nottingham Forest.|$|E

5|$|The club {{moved to}} the second Hampden Park, 150yards from the original, because the Cathcart District Railway planned a new line through {{the site of the}} ground's western terrace. A lawn bowling club at the {{junction}} of Queen's Drive and Cathcart Road marks the site of the first Hampden. The second Hampden Park opened in October 1884. It became a regular home to the Scottish Cup Final, but Celtic Park shared some of the big matches including the Scotland v England <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> 1894.|$|E
5|$|The first {{competitive}} match followed {{four days}} later, a UEFA Cup match between Manchester City and Welsh Premier League side The New Saints, which City won 5–0 with Trevor Sinclair scoring the first competitive {{goal in the}} stadium.

5|$|The {{incident}} {{has become}} a <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> American history due to the personal nature of the feud between the Earps and the McLaury and Clanton brothers and {{the symbolism of the}} fight between lawmen and the Cowboys. The Cowboys maimed Virgil and murdered Morgan but escaped prosecution, and Wyatt's extra-legal campaign for revenge captured people's attention. The gunfight and its aftermath stand for the change overcoming America as the Western frontier ceased to exist, as a nation that was rapidly industrializing pushed out what had been a largely agrarian economy.|$|E
