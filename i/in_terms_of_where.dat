2500|$|<b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>where</b> ethnogenesis took place, Philippide, {{based on}} {{historic}} and linguistic investigation, proposed {{that this happened}} after 268 AD in the Roman provinces south of the Danube: Pannonia Inferior, Moesia (Superior and Inferior) and Dardania, and not in Dacia Traiana. Later research using discoveries in archaeology and numismatics {{that had not yet}} been made in Philippide's day cast doubt on his hypothesis that the Roman population of Dacia withdrew south of the Danube during the reign of Emperor Gallienus. The linguistic portion of his hypothesis dealt with affrication, and he based his conclusions on the chronology of this phenomenon that was accepted in his time. Since then, a new timeline has come to be accepted. Nevertheless, Philippide was not strident in his conclusions, suggesting that a Romanized remnant stayed in Dacia even after 268, while in the parts of Romania that were not under Roman rule, there were people [...] "not Romanized, but only Romanianized, and who live there, where they are now, since time immemorial".|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe give {{a general}} method of characterizing {{symmetric}} orthogonal polynomials through {{a certain type}} of connection relations. This method is applied to Al-Salam–Chihara, Askey–Wilson, and Meixner–Pollaczek polynomials. This characterization technique unifies and extends some previous characterization results of Lasser and Obermaier and Ismail and Obermaier. Along the way we explicitly evaluate the connection coefficients in the expansion of Dq 2 pn <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> {pk}, <b>where</b> Dq is the Askey–Wilson operator and {pk} are general Askey–Wilson polynomials. As a limiting case we derive the corresponding connection coefficients in the expansion of W 2 Wn <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> {Wk}, <b>where</b> W is the Wilson operator and {Wk} are general Wilson polynomials. Using the connection relation for Askey–Wilson polynomials, we obtain a characterization for the two-parameter symmetric Askey–Wilson polynomials.
