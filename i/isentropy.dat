40|$|We {{investigate}} the correspondence between a perfect fluid and a scalar field and show a possible {{way of expressing}} thermodynamic quantities such as entropy, particle number density, temperature and chemical potential {{in terms of the}} scalar field phi and its kinetic term X. We prove a theorem which relates <b>isentropy</b> with purely kinetic Lagrangian. As an application, we study the evolution of the gravitational potential in cosmological perturbation theory.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} of a newly developed conjugate filter oscillation reduction (CFOR) scheme for shock-capturing {{under the influence of}} natural high-frequency oscillations. The conjugate low-pass and high-pass filters are constructed based on the principle of the discrete singular convolution. Two Euler systems, the advection of an <b>isentropy</b> vortex flow and the interaction of shock-entropy wave are considered to demonstrate the utility of the CFOR scheme. Computational accuracy and order of approximation are examined and compared with the literature. Some of the best numerical results are obtained for the shock-entropy wave interaction. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed scheme is stable, conservative and reliable for the numerical simulation of hyperbolic conservation laws. Comment: 25 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
30|$|As a {{byproduct}} of our test simulations, we obtained two results of astrophysical interest. We demonstrated that {{the failure of the}} self-similar model of the jet reconfinement in power-law atmospheres with the index κ< 8 / 3 (Kohler et al. 2012) is rooted in the assumption of <b>isentropy</b> of the shocked layer, which is made in this model. In reality, the reconfinement shock becomes stronger with the distance along the jet, resulting in a strong spatial variation of the entropy. We also found that the radial oscillations of steady-state jets, discovered in the analytical models of Poynting-dominated jets (Lyubarsky 2009) is a generic part of the jet adjustment to the space-variable external pressure and not specific to the high-magnetization regime only. The oscillations are standing waves induced by the variation.|$|E

Amount of sound energy is generated by focused ultrasound {{in the body of}} narrow area. Present HIFU treatment cannot be applied to the part surrounded by bones, such as brain, because focal point is changed by refraction and reflection of ultrasound. In this research transskull ultrasound propagation is analyzed by finite difference method for HIFU treatment to brain. Assumption of <b>isentropy</b> and small disturbance of Euler equation gives the governing equation. The density and speed of sound of each medium are given at the center of Cartesian grid cells so as to model arbitrary human body from Computerized Tomography scan images.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduced}} {{a kind of}} fluid supply system on ejector throttling. Comparing with the fluid supply system of thermodynamic expansion valve, this paper studied two kinds of fluid supply system on the freezing time, overall energy consumption and uniformity temperature distribute. The results showed that, in this working condition, the fluid supply system of ejector is 14 % shorter than the thermodynamic expansion valve in freezing time, which reducing the power consumption by shortening the working time of compressor, condenser and other equipment. Meanwhile, Ejector can act like <b>isentropy</b> and recycle some expansion work, which could increase the refrigerant capacity of evaporator to save about 6. 3 % power consumption compared with the isoenthalpy throttling of thermodynamic expansion valve. The system can reducing 10 °C temperature difference by avoiding two-phase flow fluid supply of the evaporator and reduce the flow resistance of refrigerant in evaporator. Thus, {{the quality of the}} product is improved...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulation (DNS) and linear analysis (LIA) of isotropic turbulence interacting {{with a shock}} wave are performed for several upstream shock normal Mach numbers (M(sub 1)). Turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) is amplified across the shock wave, but this amplification tends to saturate beyond M(sub 1) = 3. 0. TKE amplification and Reynolds stress anisotropy obtained in DNS are consistent with LIA predictions. Rapid evolution of TKE immediate downstream of the shock wave persists for all shock strengths and is attributed to the transfer between kinetic and potential modes of turbulence energy through acoustic fluctuations. Changes in energy spectra and various length scales across the shock wave are predicted by LIA, {{which is consistent with}} DNS results. Most turbulence length scales decrease across the shock. Dissipation length scale (rho-bar q(exp 3) / epsilon), however, increases slightly for shock waves with M(sub 1) less than 1. 65. Fluctuations in thermodynamic variables behind the shock wave stay nearly isentropic for M(sub 1) less than 1. 2 and deviate significantly from <b>isentropy</b> for the stronger shock waves due to large entropy fluctuation generated through the interaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{gravitational}} fluctuations confined inside a finite cutoff at radius r=r_c outside the horizon {{in a general}} class of black hole geometries is considered. Consistent boundary conditions at both the cutoff surface and the horizon are found and the resulting modes analyzed. For general cutoff r_c the dispersion relation is shown at long wavelengths {{to be that of}} a linearized Navier-Stokes fluid living on the cutoff surface. A cutoff-dependent line-integral formula for the diffusion constant D(r_c) is derived. The dependence on r_c is interpreted as renormalization group (RG) flow in the fluid. Taking the cutoff to infinity in an asymptotically AdS context, the formula for D(∞) reproduces as a special case well-known results derived using AdS/CFT. Taking the cutoff to the horizon, the effective speed of sound goes to infinity, the fluid becomes incompressible and the Navier-Stokes dispersion relation becomes exact. The resulting universal formula for the diffusion constant D(horizon) reproduces old results from the membrane paradigm. Hence the old membrane paradigm results and new AdS/CFT results are related by RG flow. RG flow-invariance of the viscosity to entropy ratio η /s is shown to follow from the first law of thermodynamics together with <b>isentropy</b> of radial evolution in classical gravity. The ratio is expected to run when quantum gravitational corrections are included. Comment: 34 pages, harvmac, clarified boundary conditio...|$|E
