The physical CableCARD is inserted into a slot in the host (typically a digital television set or a set-top box) {{in order to identify}} and authorize the customer, and to provide proprietary decoding of the encrypted digital cable signal without the need for a proprietary set-top box. The cable tuner, QAM demodulator, and MPEG decoder are part of the <b>host</b> <b>equipment.</b> The card performs any conditional access and decryption functions, and provides a MPEG-2 transport stream to the host. The card also receives messages sent over the out-of-band signaling channel by the cable company's headend servers and forwards them to the host.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePrecise {{displacement}} sensors are {{an important}} topic in precision engineering. At present, this type of sensors typically have a single feature of either translation or rotation measurement. They are also inconvenient to integrate with the host devices. In this report we propose {{a new kind of}} sensor that enables both translation and rotation measurement by using the combined effect of magnetostriction and piezoelectricity. As a proof of concept, we experimentally realized a prototype of non-contact translation-rotation precise sensor. In the current research stage, through both theoretical and experimental study, the non-contact displacement sensor is shown to be feasible for measuring both translation and rotation either in coarse or fine measurement. Moreover, owing to its compact, rigid structure and fewer components, it can be easily embedded in <b>host</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|E
30|$|In mobile networks, {{more than}} 80 % {{of the energy}} is {{consumed}} by the network infrastructure [2], of which more than 70 % at the base station sites [4, 5]. These sites are on the access part of the network and <b>host</b> <b>equipment</b> that enables wireless transmission and reception, connecting subscriber mobile terminals to the core network. The reason why these sites are responsible for {{so much of the}} overall energy consumption is twofold. Besides having to deploy a large quantity of such sites, to ensure full network coverage, these sites are very energy inefficient. Assuming that the effective transmitted power of a typical 3 -sector base station site is in the order of 120 W, while the total input power for the site is in excess of 2 kW, this gives an efficiency of just 6 %. Thus, the biggest saving opportunities are likely to be achieved from optimizing base stations.|$|E

The work was started by identifying the demands that SAAB Aerotech and their customer have on portable bat- tery packs. A survey was done, forming {{the basis of a}} design specication that species what an implementation should aim at fullling. The resulting design specication closely matches what is known as a smart battery, but with dierent character- istics {{especially when it comes to}} driving high power loads and coping with rough conditions. Therefore, this report describes one possible way to implement Battery" functionality in a battery pack while at the same time adressing the special de- mands of the company. A Smart Battery is capable of measuring and logging data, and uses this data to predict performance. A communication inteface can then convey this information to <b>host</b> <b>equipment</b> and chargers. A background to what smart batteries do dierently than dumb batteries is given in the beginning of the report. Following chapters discuss battery technology and smart batteries in more detail. The main portion of the report is the description of the design and implementation of a prototype smart battery pack. This section describes choice of hardware, circuit board design and coding in C. The report is concluded with results from the design and implementation. Recommendations on further work are also presented...|$|E

50|$|In November 2013, Somalia {{received}} its first fiber optic connection. The country previously {{had to rely}} on expensive satellite links due to the civil conflict, which limited internet usage. However, residents now have access to broadband internet cable for the first time after an agreement reached between Hormuud Telecom and Liquid Telecom. The deal will see Liquid Telecom link Hormuud to its 17,000 km (10,500 mile) network of terrestrial cables, which will deliver faster internet capacity. The fiber optic connection will also make online access more affordable to the average user. This in turn is expected to further increase the number of internet users. Dalkom Somalia reached a similar agreement with the West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC) Ltd, which it holds shares in. Effective the first quarter of 2014, the deal will establish fiber optic connectivity to and from Somalia via the EASSy cable. The new services are expected to reduce the cost of international bandwidth and to better optimize performance, thereby further broadening internet access. Dalkom Somalia is concurrently constructing a 2600 km2 state-of-the-art data center in Mogadishu. The site will facilitate direct connection into the international fiber optic network by <b>hosting</b> <b>equipment</b> for all of the capital's ISPs and telecommunication companies.|$|R
