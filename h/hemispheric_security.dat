Nossa hipótese é de que, tanto na dimensão regional, quanto global, o Brasil tem atuado no sentido de contrabalançar a hegemonia norte-americana, reforçando a correlação entre o status de potência regional e o cálculo de opções internacionais. The {{main purpose}} of this article is to analyse the evolution of a <b>hemispheric</b> regime of <b>security</b> using two basic issues: the impact of Mercosur in the regional geopolitical balance and the role of Brazil as a key-actor in the establishment of this agenda for regional security. Our hypothesis is that Brazil, as much in the regional, as in the global dimension, has acted so as to counterbalance the United States hegemony, strengthening the correlation between the status of regional power and the calculus of international options...|$|R

Its mission statement is [...] "To be a highly professional, well trained combat ready force that will respond effectively in support of our regular forces and the national community". The Defence Force Reserves is capable of providing reinforcement and be a force multiplier {{in the event that}} the Defence Force is called upon to carry out its roles of aid to the civil power. Established in September 1963, its primary purpose at that time was to provide essential reinforcements to the regular force. Today, those roles have grown to include assisting in the promotion of <b>hemispheric</b> and international <b>security</b> and development, with a well equipped force, trained in a broad range of disciplines and actively involved in community development.In recent years, the Reserves have been called out to assist with law enforcement and most recently to assist with the security in Trinidad's hosting the 5th Summit of the Americas in 2009.|$|R

5000|$|With the spectre of War {{again in}} Europe {{in the late}} 1930s, <b>hemispheric</b> <b>security</b> became a {{paramount}} concern of the Roosevelt Administration. There were memories of German U-Boat activities in the Caribbean and near the Panama Canal in 1918. Two agreements with the British provided for significant United States force deployment {{to a number of}} British bases in the Caribbean area, the 1940 Destroyers for Bases agreement and the 1941 Lend-Lease act. As a result of these agreements, United States military forces moved into Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Antigua, St. Lucia, Trinidad, and British Guiana. Military survey teams moved into these areas and construction proceeded in the expansion of existing British facilities and construction of new ones. The Trinidad and British Guiana bases became major stopping points for transient aircraft, bridging the 2,000 mi that separated Puerto Rico from Belem, Brazil, the northernmost base in that country capable of handling heavy traffic. Other bases used principally for defense but provided emergency landing fields for transient aircraft were constructed through Pan American Airlines agencies in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela.|$|E
5000|$|Dating {{from the}} {{election}} of President Ramón Grau San Martin in June, 1944, the Cuban Government experienced a complete turnover {{in the administration of}} its executive, military and police branches. Under the Batista government, SIS personnel in Cuba had established a close, efficient liaison with officials of the Cuban National Police, which afforded the Bureau perhaps better coverage in Cuba than in any other Latin American nation. Most of these officials were forced into exile with the change in government, but SIS representatives have been very successful in building new contacts and establishing effective relationships with the new government and police officials so that coverage in Cuba is still excellent.The political situation in Cuba is unsettled at present, principally due to the inability of the Grau administration to solve shortages in meat, milk and other essentials. One of the most unique results of the reported inefficiency of the Grau administration is the present shortage of sugar in Cuba, which has necessitated the freezing of all sugar supplies until a system can be devised whereby the Cuban people will receive a sufficient supply. Internal dissension within Grau ranks has been evidenced by the open enmity of his revolutionary adherents for his so-called “Palace Clique” which is led by Chief of Police Jose Carreno (Fiallo), Sub-Secretary of Defense. Luis Collado and Army Chief of Staff General Genovevo Perez. The revolutionary groups have served notice on Grau that they consider this clique is responsible for blocking the “true revolution” in Cuba, and if not eliminated, the revolutionaries will be forced to take things in their own hands. On April 24, 1945, Erique Enriquez, head of the Cuban Palace Secret Police which serves as a bodyguard to the President, was murdered in downtown Havana by three assailants who machine-gunned him from a passing automobile. It was generally acknowledged the assailants were members of the revolutionary group, and the murder was a warning to Grau that the revolutionaries would stop at nothing to accomplish their ends. It is of interest to note that Enriquez, who was assassinated at 10:30 a.m. had a luncheon engagement for 1:00 p.m. with our Legal Attache on the same day.The revolutionary groups in Cuba are the offspring of numerous secret organizations formed in 1932 and 1933 to combat the dictatorship of former Cuban President Gerardo Machado. Ramon Grau San Martin, a professor in the University of Havana Medical School, at that time, was regarded as a true exponent of the principles professed by these revolutionary organizations. Throughout the succeeding years, the revolutionary groups have opposed the various administrations set up in Cuba, and have resorted to blackmail, kidnapping and terrorist activities {{in the name of the}} “sacred revolution.” Under the Batista administration, a special Police unit, under Major Mariano Faget, was established to control these elements, and numerous revolutionaries were arrested and convicted of violent crimes. These same elements, through their continued support of Grau San Martin, are now in control of many branches of the Cuban government, and although it is stated that Grau is not in favor of their violent methods, he is reportedly unable to restrain them successfully.The SIAE Division (Servioio de Investigaciones de Actividades Enemigas) of the Cuban National Police, which is the branch with which Bureau personnel has cooperated closely in its <b>hemispheric</b> <b>security</b> program, was under the control of Major Mario Salabarria during the past year. Salabarria, although he is a revolutionary with no previous police experience, proved to be a valuable source of information and was most cooperative with our representatives in Cuba. President Grau, himself, advised our Legal Attache that it was his intention to establish the Cuban Police as an efficient, military, non-political organization similar to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Throughout the year, numerous cases within the primary jurisdiction of the Bureau have been referred to SIS personnel in Havana. During the last eight months of the fiscal year, twenty-four Selective Service cases have been forwarded to Cuba for investigation. Other Federal violations which have been handled by SIS personnel in Cuba included White Slave Traffic Act cases, Passport and Visa matters, Impersonation, Custom Laws and Smuggling, NSPA, UFAP, Servicemen’s Dependence Allowance Act, Illegal Wearing of the Uniform, Theft of Government Property, Federal Reserve Act, Censorship Violations and others. In February, 1945, one Thomas Desmord Paul Manion, a Canadian national, was apprehended by Cuban National Police at the request of our Legal Attache, due to the numerous conflicting stories he had told concerning his background and because he had in his possession documentation made out in several different names as well as both R.C.A.F. and United States Naval uniforms. Inquiry of the Bureau reflected Manion was a fugitive from process issued by the United States Commissioner at Newark, New Jersey, for illegally wearing the uniform of a friendly power, i.e., Canada. Further investigation at Miami, Florida, reflected subject had stolen the United States Naval property, had illegally worn the uniform of a Canadian officer in Florida and had married (name redacted) of Summit, New Jersey, under an alias and succeeded in getting his wife to withdraw her savings of approximately $1200 which subject promptly spent. Arrangements were made to return the subject to the United States, where he was sentenced to sixteen months’ imprisonment by the Federal Court at Miami, Florida on June 1, 1945. Deportation proceedings are pending against the subject after he serves his prison sentence.Prior to the termination of the European war, the SIS personnel in Havana maintained an extensive Foreign Travel Control program, which was closely coordinated with the program established by the Bureau. Members of the Office of the Legal Attache, in conjunction with Cuban Police agents, interviewed all passengers arriving in Cuba from Europe and forwarded interrogation reports to the Bureau. These passengers disembarked in Havana from Spanish vessels which arrived every six weeks carrying an average of 150 passengers to Cuba on each trip. Passengers were interrogated for data of value to the war effort, as well as information concerning their background, political sympathies and reason for travel to this hemisphere. The Havana office also prepares memoranda regarding passengers proceeding by air from Havana to Miami, Florida, which are forwarded directly to the Miami Field Division so these data are available when the passengers arrive. The names of all passengers embarking at Havana for Europe on Spanish vessels are searched against our Havana office indices and arrangements are made for the interrogation of those passengers concerning whom derogatory information is recorded.(paragraph redacted)Informant coverage on Communist matters in Cuba has been very productive and of great value to the Bureau, inasmuch as Cuba is the center of extensive Communist activities. For a time, it appeared that the administration of President Grau San Martin would curb the Communist influence over the Cuban labor unions, but the control of the Confederacion de Trabajadores de Cuba (which effectively dominates practically all the Cuban labor unions) has remained in Communist hands, and recently, the Grau Government has allotted $725,000 for the construction of a Cuban labor palace. This has been regarded as a payment to the Communists for their continued support of the present administration. Russian diplomatic representatives have been very active in promoting cultural and propaganda activities in Cuba directed at the intellectual elements as well as the Cuban masses. Extensive coverage is being maintained on this phase of Communist activities. (More complete data on Communist matters in Cuba may be found in the section of this report dealing with Communism).|$|E

40|$|This article {{sheds light}} on the adventures of the Germans and {{citizens}} from other Axis countries resident in Latin America during the Second World War. Considered a threat to <b>hemispheric</b> <b>security,</b> and given the political, economic and diplomatic pressure exercised by the United States in the region, the Italians, Japanese, and especially the Germans were subject to expulsion, reclusion, and expropriation. This interference, aimed at aligning all the governments in a common struggle against the foreign enemy {{shed light on the}} fact that the Good Neighbour Policy, established by the northern power after the Great Depression to repair its relations with Latin America, in truth, was used during the war to exaggerate what a danger they were and, as such, combat –in an apparent framework of legality, and in law- competitors that hindered the expansion of North American capital. The article outlines the way in which deportations, Proclaimed Lists or blacklists, confinement in concentration camps, expropriations and the nationalization of the property of citizens for the Axis countries, especially Germans, were used to make it easier for people from the US to enter Latin America together with their industries and businesses. This occurred in the context of industrialisation that a number of countries were developing and in which the US was also interested as a way to expand its economic imperialism...|$|E
40|$|The South American Defense Council (CSD), {{created in}} March 2009 as a {{military}} coordinating body of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) demonstrates a growing trend among Latin American countries to approach matters of regional security independent of the United States. The CSD also indicates a maturation of democratic civil military relations in a region once dominated by authoritarian military regimes. The CSD aims to facilitate the exchange of information about regional defense policies, promote collaboration for disaster relief, and promote civil-military engagement. In {{less than a year}} it is hardly a tested entity, but the presence of 12 South American states coming together around security policy marks an important moment in the evolution of civil-military relations in the region. Brazil has taken on an important leadership role in the CSD, acting as a leader in recent regional peacekeeping efforts. As a geopolitical move, Brazil also sees a benefit in promoting good relationships with all countries of South america, given its common border with nine of them. Although the United States is {{not a member of the}} CSD, the organization 2 ̆ 7 s agenda of infromation exchange of defense policies, military cooperation, and capacity building, including disaster assistance and preparedness provide opportunities for greater collaboration. The CSD is not part of the Inter-American System created after the Second World War. It is unclear how its work will coincide with the OAS Committee on <b>Hemispheric</b> <b>Security</b> or its Secretariat for Multidimensional Security. The U. S. should view the CSD as a mechanism to promote joint initiatives that encourage democratic governance in the region...|$|E
40|$|On April 9, 1940, Germany invaded Denmark. Instantly, {{the fate}} {{and status of}} Greenland, a Danish colony, was thrust into limbo. During the war, Greenland’s vital mineral {{resources}} and location made it significant for the warring parties {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. However, conflicting international corporate and political interests made any act to defend the island on the part of the Allies, or the officially neutral Americans, problematic. Within a year of the Danish occupation, the American government had signed an agreement for the defense of Greenland, extending the protection of both the Monroe Doctrine and the American military to the island. This action was an important step in the formal expansion of American influence in the Western Hemisphere that occurred during the Second World War. This thesis argues that global economic, political, and technological changes led to Greenland’s increased geopolitical significance and set the stage for a shift in the balance of power within the North Atlantic Triangle. It demonstrates how decisions relating to the security of the island came to be made and how conflicting interests within and between governments affected the genesis of the occupation. It explores how Winston Churchill’s decision to mine the North Sea led to the American occupation of Greenland and examines the ways in which the effects of Churchill’s actions raised concerns in Canada about the possibility of a British defeat, which in turn led Mackenzie King, the Canadian Prime Minister, to align his foreign policy closer to that of the United States’ President Roosevelt. This thesis also asserts that Roosevelt successfully used the potential foreign occupation of Greenland to demonstrate to the American public the dangers of foreign conflicts to the United States and to further his <b>hemispheric</b> <b>security</b> objectives both domestically and abroad. These events had a profound and lasting impact on the relationships within the North Atlantic Triangle and on political identity in Greenland, and signalled an important shift in the foreign policy of the United States toward greater American involvement in world affairs. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E
