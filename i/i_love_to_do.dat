500|$|The film {{features}} a musical score by Aaron Zigman, {{who was hired}} after Alison Krauss {{backed out of the}} job. Zigman mentioned that there are similarities between the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia and the film Flicka in that [...] "...at times there's a bit of a Celtic influence but not much", but he also {{went on to say that}} there was a more modern feel to the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia. He did so as Csupó requested him to do not compose [...] "your typical Hollywood Score"; he then mixed up orchestral melody with [...] "a bit of a modern flavor." [...] The score he composed for the film is described as [...] "very large" [...] compared to his other work, and Zigman commented that [...] "Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> I also like big orchestral stuff, and want to do more of that, and this film enabled me to spread my wings out a bit." [...] The official soundtrack for the film was released as Music from and Inspired by Bridge to Terabithia by Hollywood Records on February 13, 2007.|$|E

He categorised his style of music [...] "ome of it is not strictly blues but it has {{the basis of that}} genre. I like to think that the listener gets a good feeling and doesn't take me too seriously. I'm a little irreverent at times but tongue in cheek".|$|E
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 11 Key Wane {{began playing}} the piano in the church every first Sunday, {{initially}} teaching himself melodies before his mom heard him and got involved in his learning. He would tell XXL, “She ordered me this Yamaha keyboard out of a JCPenney catalog. It got mailed to the house, and I just started making beats on it. Then I started taking piano lessons, and the stuff I learned from my piano lessons, I would combine that with beats, and it really was just something that <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> man. <b>I</b> really didn’t go out a lot cause I was always coming up with stuff." [...] In December 2012, Key Wane graduated from Tennessee State University {{with a degree in}} Musical Arts and Sciences.|$|R

But I'll put it out there: <b>I</b> would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a tour where it's me, T.I. and Young Jeezy. Me, Tip and Jeezy would be outrageous. But nothing is confirmed at the moment." ...|$|R

She took lessons in tap dance, and states that her parents were supportive of her career choice. Describing her childhood, she says it [...] "was filled with things that <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and also very normal things: I lived in New York, I have a family life and went to a regular school." ...|$|R

6000|$|What <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is {{to walk up}} {{and down}} among them and catch the little scraps of conversation. The other day I heard one lean forward and say, [...] "Well, I offered him {{a million and a half}} and said I wouldn't give a cent more, he could either take it or leave it--" [...] I just longed to break in and say, [...] "What! what! a million and a half! Oh! say that again! Offer it to me, to either take it or leave it. Do try me once: I know I can: or here, make it a plain million and let's call it done." ...|$|E
60|$|This idea {{caught the}} fancy of many. By our {{dispersing}} instantly Seth would seemingly show himself a lad {{ready to make}} mischief among the king's people. It would be a mighty neat way of turning the tables on the traitor, and right thoroughly would <b>I</b> have <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it but {{for the fact that}} we would be abandoning Hiram.|$|R

She writes: Learning folktales was {{something}} <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> as a child. Every night, I asked my parents, brothers, sisters, and familiar guests to tell stories. Children {{who lived in}} remote herding pastures were proud of knowing many stories at that time, {{when there was no}} electricity to watch TV and videos. We children shared our stories with each other when we herded yaks and during our free time, especially afterdinner. We shared stories in turn. When it was my turn, I often told the story of the frog boy and his family because, when I first learned this story from my eldest sister (Chosenyi Drolma; b. 1975), I found the characters to be interesting, mysterious, and frightening...|$|R
500|$|In June 2007, The Stage {{reported}} that Moffat and Sawalha {{are interested in}} reviving Press Gang. He said: [...] "I would revive that like a shot. <b>I</b> would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a reunion episode—a grown-up version. I know Julia Sawalha is interested—every time I see her she asks me when we are going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. Maybe it will happen—I would like it to." ...|$|R

"Why, {{my father}} {{stretched}} his rainbow over here this morning, {{so that one}} end of it touched this road," [...] was the reply; [...] "and I was dancing upon the pretty rays, as <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and never noticed I was getting too far over the bend in the circle. Suddenly I began to slide, and I went faster and faster until at last I bumped on the ground, at the very end. Just then father lifted the rainbow again, without noticing me at all, and though I tried to seize {{the end of it}} and hold fast, it melted away entirely and I was left alone and helpless on the cold, hard earth!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 16. I {{design to}} stay here this week by myself, about some {{business}} that lies on my hands, and will take up {{a great deal of}} time. Dr. Adams,(7) one of the canons, invited me to-day to dinner. The tables are so full here on Sunday {{that it is hard to}} dine with a few, and Dr. Adams knows <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so; which is very obliging. The Queen saw company in her bed-chamber; she looks very well, but she sat down. I supped with Lord Treasurer as usual, and stayed till past one as usual, and with our usual company, except Lord Keeper, who did not come this time to Windsor. I hate these suppers mortally, but I seldom eat anything.|$|E

5000|$|On March 27, 2003, Sue TL Fox of WBAN interviewed Cathy [...] "Cat" [...] Davis, and Davis {{spoke to}} her about {{what she was doing}} since {{retiring}} from boxing. Davis said, [...] "Just after I retired, I returned to University to study Sports Psychology/Philosophy. I had been recruited by the coach of the National Championship San Jose State fencing team so it was an easy choice of where to study. So I fenced and studied happily. Then my other <b>love</b> came <b>to</b> the fore when I started to work in a 4 Star French Restaurant to support myself. I had been taught to cook by my Grandmother since I was very young and it had always been something <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for friends. Now I was working my way up the ladder of a tough profession that, at that time, had few women. Obviously, that didn't stop me in boxing, so why should it stop me in cooking? <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> the challenge and learned quickly.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II, {{the owners of the}} Spanish and Indian Trading Company decided to switch to war-related opportunities, and in 1943 the company closed down, putting McKibbin out of a job. Then in March 1943, she was approached by three men from California seeking to establish a new office in Santa Fe, who offered to hire her as a secretary. She was particularly impressed by one of them. She later wrote: I thought to be associated with that person, whoever he was, would be simply great! I never met a person with a magnetism that hit you so fast and so completely as his did. I didn't know what he did. I thought maybe if he were digging trenches to put in a new road, <b>I</b> would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, or if he were soliciting ads for a magazine or something, <b>I</b> would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. <b>I</b> just wanted to be allied and have something <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with a person of such vitality and radiant force.|$|R

Gordon had made Hard Times (1975) and The Driver (1978) with Walter Hill; he sent the script to Hill {{with a copy of}} Sol Yurick's novel. Hill recalls, [...] "I said 'Larry, <b>I</b> would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, but nobody will let us do it.' It was going to be too extreme and too weird." ...|$|R
