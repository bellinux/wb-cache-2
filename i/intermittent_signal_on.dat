40|$|Abstract. Aiming at {{relieving}} {{the mode}} mixing of the intrinsic time-scale decomposition (ITD) method used {{to process the}} <b>intermittent</b> <b>signals,</b> the improved intrinsic time-scale decomposition (IITD) method is proposed in the paper. The IITD method employs white noise which has the uniform power distribution in different frequencies as a reference to resolve the problem. Furthermore, a simulation signal was utilized to examine {{the performance of the}} IITD method {{as well as that of}} the original ITD method. As a result, the comparison between the results from the two methods indicates that the IITD method reflects an obvious improvement on the original ITD method for processing the <b>intermittent</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} problem of quickly {{detecting}} a change between a normal and an anomalous state in an <b>intermittent</b> <b>signal</b> (i. e., a signal which is potentially persistently changing between these states). We pose our <b>intermittent</b> <b>signal</b> detection (ISD) problem as an optimal stopping problem, and establish that its optimal solution can be expressed as a stopping rule with a threshold structure. We also show how our ISD problem reduces to the classical Bayesian quickest detection problem as a special case. We then propose a new conditional mean estimate filter to estimate {{time spent in the}} anomalous state when an alert is declared. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm in a simulation study...|$|R
40|$|Bluetooth is a {{promising}} wireless technology aiming at supporting electronic devices to be instantly interconnected into short-range ad hoc networks.

In order to cope up with this interference source, this paper proposes a sophisticated interference aware Bluetooth segmentation algorithm ([BLUES), where Bluetooth packet types are selected depending on the packet success probability, which {{is calculated based on}} the interference generated by multiple piconets. Among other things, we show that when the number of bridge nodes are larger than five the propagation delay between piconets increases rapidly. We have also observed a drastic overhead in the current Bluetooth piconet switching procedure and conclude that future enhancements to this procedure are crucial to efficiency of Bluetooth-based ad hoc networking...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of Bluetooth as a defacto radio interface has allowed handheld electronic devices to be instantly interconnected as ad hoc networks. Recent {{studies show that}} since Bluetooth operates in the unlicensed 2. 45 GHz frequency band, the presence of multiple piconets in the vicinity creates <b>intermittent</b> interference <b>on</b> <b>signal</b> reception which, in turn, degrades the overall throughput of the network. Another kind of interference, called as persistent interference, is the one generated by IEEE 802. 11 enabled devices as they use the same frequency band as Bluetooth, and thus may lead to significant performance degradation. In order to cope up with both of these interference sources, this paper proposes an interference aware Bluetooth segmentation algorithm (IBLUES), where Bluetooth packet types are selected depending on the packet success probability, which {{is calculated based on}} the interference generated both by multiple piconets, as well as by IEEE 802. 11 devices.

This approach removes the need to perform global multi-sensor/multi-target data association, e.g. as necessary in [20], thereby maintaining computational feasibility, even for large scale problems.|$|R

50|$|When Johnny Ray was {{implanted}} in 1998, {{one of the}} neurotrophic electrodes started providing an <b>intermittent</b> <b>signal</b> after it had become anchored in the neuropil, and as a result, Dr. Kennedy was forced {{to rely on the}} remaining devices. Therefore, even if there is no complication from surgery, there is still a possibility that the electronics will fail. In addition, while the implants themselves are encased in the skull and are therefore relatively safe from physical damage, the electronics {{on the outside of the}} skull are vulnerable. Two of Dr. Kennedy's patients accidentally caused damage during spasms, but in both cases only the external devices needed to be replaced.|$|R

40|$|In many physical, technological, {{social, and}} {{economic}} applications, one is commonly {{faced with the}} task of estimating statistical properties, such as mean first passage times of a temporal continuous process, from empirical data (experimental observations).

We propose here a theoretical-computational framework which provides us with a systematic and rational estimation of statistical quantities of a given temporal process, such as waiting times between subsequent bursts of activity in <b>intermittent</b> <b>signals.</b> Our framework is illustrated with applications from real-world data sets, ranging from marine biology to paleoclimatic data...|$|R

50|$|A {{major concern}} is that the {{broadcast}} technology used for ATSC signals called 8VSB has problems receiving signals inside buildings and in urban areas, largely due to multipath reception issues which cause ghosting and fading on analog images, but can lead to <b>intermittent</b> <b>signal</b> or no reception at all on ATSC programs. DTV broadcasts exhibit a digital cliff effect, by which viewers will receive either a perfect signal or no signal at all with little or no middle ground. Digital transmissions do contain additional data bits to provide error correction for a finite number of bit errors; once signal quality degrades beyond that point, recovery of the original digital signal becomes impossible, and the image on the screen freezes, or blinks back and forth to totally blank black.|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{organization}} of bristles on the Drosophila notum has long {{served as a}} popular model of robust tissue patterning. During this process, membrane-tethered Delta activates intracellular Notch signaling in neighboring epithelial cells, which inhibits Delta expression. This induces lateral inhibition, yielding a pattern in which each Delta-expressing mechanosensory organ precursor cell in the epithelium is surrounded on all sides by cells with active Notch signaling. Here, we show that conventional models of Delta-Notch signaling cannot account for bristle spacing or the gradual refinement of this pattern. Instead, the pattern refinement we observe using live imaging is dependent upon dynamic, basal actin-based filopodia and can be quantitatively reproduced by simulations of lateral inhibition incorporating Delta-Notch signaling by transient filopodial contacts between nonneighboring cells. Significantly, the <b>intermittent</b> <b>signaling</b> induced by these filopodial dynamics generates a type of structured noise that is uniquely suited to the generation of well-ordered, tissue-wide epithelial patterns...|$|R
40|$|The {{orientation}} of insects towards attractive odour sources depends upon both the {{temporal and spatial}} distribution of odorants downwind from the source. This was first investigated by Wright (1958) and studied in further detail using male moths, which are attracted by female pheromones over long distances (Baker and Vickers, 1997; Cardé and Mafra-Neto, 1997; Murlis et al., 1992; Kaissling and Kramer, 1990). An odour evaporating from a small source such as a female pheromone gland remains confined to a thin filament of pheromone-laden air near the source. During downwind transport, however, the filament becomes increasingly disrupted and diluted due to turbulence in the air. This results in a highly <b>intermittent</b> <b>signal,</b> whose temporal and structural characteristics vary with distance from the source (Murlis, 1997; Murlis and Jones, 1981).
