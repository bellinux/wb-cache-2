40|$|This report {{describes}} the thermal properties, strength, and elastic modulus of lightweight, normal, and high strength concrete at elevated temperatures. Section 6 (Design for Fire Resistance) of the New Zealand standard for concrete structure (NZS 3101, 1995) provides recommended values and minimum requirements for concrete at elevated temperatures. These values will be reviewed {{with respect to}} overseas standards and experimental data to find their applicability to lightweight and high strength concretes. A series of tests were performed on 1 m x 1 m lightweight and high strength concrete specimens to determine their <b>insulation</b> fire <b>resistance.</b> The specimens were produced in three thicknesses; 60, 130, and 175 mm. This follows the method of earlier tests by Wade et al. (1991) and Wade (1992) on New Zealand aggregate concretes. It was determined that the strength reduction curve given by NZS 3101 over-predicts the strength of high strength concrete at elevated temperatures, though the values for elastic modulus and <b>insulation</b> fire <b>resistance</b> {{can be applied to}} high strength concrete. The <b>insulation</b> fire <b>resistance,</b> strength, and elastic modulus values given by NZS 3101 were found to also apply to lightweight concrete. The report recommends a change to the elastic modulus curve given in NZS 3101. The purpose of this is to give consistency between the strength and elastic modulus curves, which do not currently reach zero at the same temperature...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the risk of {{electric}} shock during a surgical procedure, it’s important to know the insulation paths and {{the values of the}} insulation impedances of Medical Electrical (ME) equipment and then to draw “leakage circuits ” and monitor the intensity of “leakage currents”. The aim of this work is to propose a circuit based model of a ME equipment to simulate the leakage currents measured during electrical safety tests. The set-up of these measures are described in the standard EN 60601 - 1, which also describes the insulations composing a ME equipment and where they are placed. While the standard EN 62353 describes the <b>insulation</b> <b>resistances</b> should be measured. This information is the references for the model development which is subsequently implemented with the circuit simulation software National Instruments Multisim. The application of the circuit model allows the simulation of an earth leakage current, touch current and patient leakage current similar to real equipment, both in normal and in single fault conditions. The values of the electrical parameters of the model from a measurement report of a commercial defibrillator are assigned. The results of circuit model leakage currents are compared with the measurement data. The output of this comparison may be considered quite satisfactory. In this paper the extension of the model to other ME equipment is also discussed in view of the assessment of the risk of electrical shock during a surgical procedure...|$|R
