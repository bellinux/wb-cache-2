5|$|In the United States, Ohno is {{credited}} with popularizing and being {{the face of his}} sport. He said <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> being a role model to younger skaters. Growing up, he did not have that influence within his sport, but looked up to other athletes outside his sport, such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and Lance Armstrong. Training for short track has been the main focus of Ohno's life, but {{he has been able to}} work on other endeavors. He studied business at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> {{to think}} that this is the only country in Europe where this form of sport is not permitted... There seems to be the mistaken idea that it would be {{necessary}} to close the roads. This, of course, is entirely wrong... There would be no better time than now to introduce this form of racing to the roads, what with the decreased amount of motor traffic and the important part that the cycle is playing in wartime transport.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{in all four}} categories appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Hülkenberg revealed that Porsche's objective was to have one car featured on the podium and was astonished over the team's first and second-place results. He {{said that he was}} proud and delighted at his team's achievement: [...] "We had a flawless race with a great pace and we didn't make any mistake. The last lap was a bit weird because it was drizzling and people got nervous in the garage. After the finish line, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> to see thousands and thousands of people cheering up." [...] Bamber stated that the win was [...] "beyond my dreams" [...] and hoped to return to the event in future years with Porsche. Tandy described his success as [...] "surreal": [...] "I can’t think of two better people to share the car with. We haven’t put a wheel wrong all race and we’ve just won the biggest race in the world." ...|$|E

500|$|Director Radha Mohan {{expressed}} a desire to remake the film but decided against it: [...] "If there is one film I want to remake, [...] will be the one, but I know I will not, because I believe classics should be left alone." [...] Director and choreographer Prabhu Deva ranked Server Sundaram among his favourite films. A restaurant named [...] "Hotel Server Sundaram" [...] is located in the Thuraipakkam area of Chennai. In December 2014, G. Babu Jayakumar of The New Indian Express included the film in his list of Balachander's noted films. Clips from Server Sundaram were screened along with clips from other films such as Iru Kodugal (1969), Arangetram (1973), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), Avargal (1977) and Azhagan (1991) at a function held in Balachander's honour at Tiruchirappalli in January 2015, a month after his death. Server Sundaram is also used as the title of an 2017 film starring Santhanam and Nagesh's grandson Bijesh, with its producer Selva having bought the title rights from AVM Productions. On why that title was chosen, Selva said, [...] "Santhanam plays a chef in the film and we felt that Server Sundaram, in which Nagesh played the role of a server, would be apt for this film, too. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> how well the title suited the concept of our film, which is why we went right ahead with our decision." [...] S. Jegathiswaran, writing for Daily News Sri Lanka, noted, [...] "In [...] Sundaram, [...] showed that after having gained the social status one shouldn't forget one's past." [...] Actor Vikram, who became popularly known by the moniker [...] "Chiyaan" [...] after the release of Sethu in 1999, stated in August 2016, [...] "After Nagesh sir [...] becomes something else, he still holds his server uniform close to his heart as a memento. Chiyaan is something like that to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Franciscus Peeters was {{employed}} in the ammunition factory to help maintain the machinery. One day he went to inspect the interior {{of one of the}} machines on the shell-shop. The current was supposed to be switched off at his request, but for some reason his colleague failed to do so. The machine suddenly started up and ripped his left arm off in an instant. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> he survived, but he did. Because of his handicap he was given the choice between a lump sum (unknown amount) or a monthly payment. Seen the difficult circumstances he chooses the first solution. (He also became the projectionist for the camp cinema.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{design was}} {{theatrical}} in the extreme. The imposing principal facade of Oamaru Stone consisted almost solely of one huge portico constructed of six ionic columns, while the facade was crowned {{by a high}} pediment more {{in the style of}} Vitruvius than Palladio, and behind the great facade stretched the single body of the church, with the remaining facades in a less severe Romanesque style. Considering that his brief was that [...] "a serviceable church in brick should be erected {{on the site of the}} old Cathedral", <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> that such an almost avant-garde style should have been permitted. The completed structure would not be out of place in 17th century or 18th century Rome or Venice.|$|E

2500|$|... "The lyrics on {{this record}} are unrelenting in their unpleasantness," [...] lamented Peter Clarke in Hi-Fi News & Record Review, {{awarding}} the album a rock-bottom [...] "D:4" [...] rating. [...] "The cumulative effect is like listening to an endless fight next door. The music on this record is {{without a hint}} of dynamics or melody." [...] "In the wake of Public Enemy and KRS-One, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> that something this lightweight could cause such a stir," [...] snorted Charlie Dick in a two-star review for Q. [...] "The all-mouth-and-trousers content is backed up by likable drum machine twittering, minimal instrumentation and duffish production... This regressive nonsense will be passed off as social commentary by thrill-seekers all across the free world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ruthenium is {{the most}} active of the F-T catalysts. [...] It works at the lowest {{reaction}} temperatures, and it produces the highest molecular weight hydrocarbons. It acts as a Fischer Tropsch catalyst as the pure metal, without any promotors, thus providing the simplest catalytic system of Fischer Tropsch synthesis, where mechanistic conclusions should be the easiest—e.g., much easier than with iron as the catalyst. Like with nickel, the selectivity changes to mainly methane at elevated temperature. Its high price and limited world resources exclude industrial application. Systematic Fischer Tropsch studies with ruthenium catalysts should contribute substantially to the further exploration of the fundamentals of Fischer Tropsch synthesis. There is an interesting question to consider: what features have the metals nickel, iron, cobalt, and ruthenium in common to let them—and only them—be Fischer–Tropsch catalysts, converting the CO/H2 mixture to aliphatic (long chain) hydrocarbons in a ‘one step reaction’. The term ‘one step reaction’ means that reaction intermediates are not desorbed from the catalyst surface. In particular, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> that the much carbided alkalized iron catalyst gives a similar reaction as the just metallic ruthenium catalyst.|$|E
2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But I must say that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E
