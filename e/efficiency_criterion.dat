In a for-profit organization, the [...] "criterion of efficiency" [...] states than an individual will select an alternative that will maximize income and minimize cost so as to [...] "yield the greatest net (money) return to the organization".

40|$|International audienceThe {{evaluation}} of hydrologic model behaviour and performance is commonly made and reported through comparisons of simulated and observed variables. Frequently, comparisons are made between simulated and measured streamflow at the catchment outlet. In distributed hydrological modelling approaches, additional comparisons of simulated and observed measurements for multi-response validation may {{be integrated into}} the evaluation procedure to assess overall modelling performance. In both approaches, single and multi-response, <b>efficiency</b> <b>criteria</b> are commonly used by hydrologists to provide an objective assessment of the "closeness" of the simulated behaviour to the observed measurements. While there are a few <b>efficiency</b> <b>criteria</b> such as the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, coefficient of determination, and index of agreement that are frequently used in hydrologic modeling studies and reported in the literature, there are a large number of other <b>efficiency</b> <b>criteria</b> to choose from. The selection and use of specific <b>efficiency</b> <b>criteria</b> and the interpretation of the results can be a challenge for even the most experienced hydrologist since each criterion may place different emphasis on different types of simulated and observed behaviours.

40|$|The paper {{argues that}} the notion of Pareto {{efficiency}} builds on two normative assumptions: the more general consequentialist norm of any <b>efficiency</b> <b>criterion,</b> and the strong no-harm principle of the prohibition of any redistribution during the economic process that hurts at least one person. These normative concerns lead to a constrained and static notion of efficiency in mainstream economics, ignoring dynamic efficiency gains from more equal allocations of resources. The paper argues that a weak no-harm principle instead provides an endogenous <b>efficiency</b> <b>criterion,</b> which shifts attention away from equilibrium analysis in hypothetically perfect markets towards an evolutionary analysis of efficiency in real-world, non-equilibrium markets.

40|$|Analytical {{relationships}} between the investment performance criteria (net present value (NPV), levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), {{internal rate of return}} (IRR), discounted payback period (TPB), and discounted costs (Z)) and basic engineering-economic parameters of nuclear reactors (capital costs K, annual operating costs Y, annual revenue R, NPP construction TC and operation TE periods), characterizing the NPP profitability and competitiveness at the microeconomic level, are defined for the first time. The power function of discounted cash flows was used in calculations. It is shown that the joint analysis of the entire set of investment <b>efficiency</b> <b>criteria</b> (not only LCOE as it is often done) can help avoid contradictions in assessing the NPP project profitability and formulate optimal requirements on the reactor engineering and economic parameters. The obtained analytical expressions provide solutions not only of the traditional «direct problem» (assessing <b>efficiency</b> <b>criteria</b> according to the forecasted capital and operating costs and profit stream) but, which is of equal importance, the solution of the «inverse problem»: assessing restrictions on capital and operating costs, i. e. identifying «investment corridors», based on the desired values of <b>efficiency</b> <b>criteria.</b> The investment risk assessment results obtained by Monte-Carlo method are presented in order to account for the inherent uncertainties in the forecasts of long-term cash flow during the NPP construction and operation required for assessing the efficiency of investments.
