500|$|On March 28, 2012, Jessica Sanchez, a {{contestant}} of {{the eleventh}} season of American Idol, covered [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] performing a slow-tempo ballad {{version of the}} song accompanied at the beginning by harps. Her performance received favorable comments and a standing ovation from the judges of the show. Jennifer Lopez commented, [...] "You did a beautiful job on it...If I was Beyoncé and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>home</b> and I heard that, I'd be like 'I got {{to do that in}} my next concert, slow that one down.'" [...] Steven Tyler described Sanchez's performance as [...] "great" [...] while Randy Jackson noted that it was [...] "unbelievable, sensational". James Montgomery of MTV News graded her performance with a B, and called the cover [...] "a bit of an odd choice, and yet also a supremely confident one". He added, [...] "For once, she pulled things back, and maybe suffered a bit for doing so, but there were still plenty of subtly great moments, particularly in the verses. Might not have been her best—it definitely lacked in vocal fireworks...And really, it was good enough".|$|E
2500|$|Clare Tyler (later Bates) was {{introduced}} by {{the executive producer of}} EastEnders, Leonard Lewis. Gemma Bissix was cast in the role. Reflecting on the casting process in 2001, Bissix said, [...] "I was nine when I started on EastEnders. I did drama classes after school and my mum took me to an audition. There were about 50 others. I read through the script and by the time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>home</b> they had phoned my dad to tell him I had the role. I was only supposed to be in it for three episodes, but it turned into five years." [...] It was her first acting job and she had received no formal training. In 2008, Bissix stated, [...] "that was my training [...] quite a lot of people [...] drama school, I was trained by EastEnders." [...] The character made her first appearance in July 1993 as the daughter of Debbie Tyler (played by Nicola Duffett), a love interest for an EastEnders regular, Nigel Bates (played by Paul Bradley).|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>home</b> again, in San Francisco, without {{means and}} without employment.

I showed it to several friends, but they all shook their heads. They said nobody would come to hear me, and I would make a humiliating failure of it.|$|E

60|$|Having been so {{successful}} in our first attempt at foraging, we went almost boldly around the village when our store of provisions ran low, begging at this house or at that without questioning whether the occupants might be for the king or for the colony, receiving sometimes with a generous hand, and then again in niggardly manner, at least enough of food to keep us alive, although I am free to confess that never once from the day the Jerseyman left us until <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>home</b> again on the plantation, did I feel as though my stomach was well filled.|$|E

All I remember is that Uncle Eugene never came to see us or spoke to us when he met us anywhere, and we were all afraid of him somehow. I used to think of him as an ogre who would come creeping up the back stairs after dark and carry me off bodily if I wasn't good. What made him our enemy? And how did he come to get all of Grandfather Page's property when Father got nothing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, dear lass, {{the thing}} that gives me so much {{pleasure}} and hope is not absolutely fixed, and I don't {{want you to be}} made anxious.

The day of the murder we heard the news very early in the morning. Mother prepared breakfast--and other meals afterward--as usual; but not a mouthful was eaten all day by either of us. We each drank half a cup of coffee; that was all. Little was said. We got every newspaper morning and evening, and the frequent extras of that period, and pass'd them silently to each other.) ...|$|E
