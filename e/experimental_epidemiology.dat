40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{attempted}} to describe the manner of spread of an endemic, native, respiratory infection and a method for its control. The essential factor determining the prevalence of such an endemic disease is, we believe, host susceptibility, which is controlled by hereditary and environmental influences. Furthermore, it seems probable {{that the amount of}} this population susceptibility determines the dosage of specific microbes available to the population. An increase in dosage in the herd is followed by an increase in the spread and severity of the infection, and a decrease by a corresponding alleviation. Hence, two methods for the prevention of epidemics are available: (1) an enhancement of population resistance, and (2) the reduction to a minimum of available dosage. These procedures have proved successful for 3 years in maintaining a population of breeding rabbits, {{in the midst of a}} badly infected community, entirely free from Bact. lepisepticum infection. Confirmation of the above conclusions has been gained from other studies in the field of <b>experimental</b> <b>epidemiology.</b> Dr. D. T. Smith (2), at Saranac, New York, found that changes in population susceptibility were responsible for a severe outbreak of Bact. lepisepticum infection and septicemia. Freund (3), at Berlin, has just published an interesting account of respiratory epidemics of rabbits and guinea pigs, apparently brought about by sudden changes in temperature and housing conditions. Pneumonia and Pasteurella infection, endemic in the population, increased suddenly in extent and severity. Nevertheless, neither endemic nor epidemic strains of the microorganisms were found to be especially virulent. Dr. Theobald Smith (4), in a study of paratyphoid epidemics of guinea pigs, has made similar observations. He noted that pregnant females acted as the foci of infection, and that from these individuals, presumably of lessened resistance, the bacteria were given off and infection was spread. The studies in <b>experimental</b> <b>epidemiology</b> are rapidly reaching a stage where they may be applied to the problems of human disease. Indeed, more recent observations of the mode of spread of pneumonia (5 – 7), scarlet fever (8), typhoid (9, 10), plague (11), diphtheria (12 – 14), measles (15), and tuberculosis (16 – 18) increasingly show a tendency to discard the theory of fluctuating microbic virulence and to emphasize the importance of the host factors...|$|E

Major advances in descriptive psychiatric epidemiology in recent years include the development of reliable and valid fully structured diagnostic interviews, the implementation of parallel cross-national surveys of the prevalences and correlates of mental disorders, and the initiation of research in clinical epidemiology. Remaining challenges include the refinement of diagnostic categories and criteria, recognition and evaluation of systematic underreporting bias in surveys of mental disorders, creation and use of accurate assessment tools for studying disorders of children, adolescents, the elderly, and people in less developed countries, and setting up systems to carry out small area estimations for needs assessment and programme planning. Advances in analytical and <b>experimental</b> <b>epidemiology</b> have been more modest. A major challenge is for psychiatric epidemiologists to increase the relevance of their analytical research to their colleagues in preventative psychiatry as well as to social policy analysts.

METHOD: A narrative review of the studies published since the last IARC assessment in 1991 (genotoxicity, <b>experimental</b> carcinogenesis, and <b>epidemiology).</b> RESULTS: Two different mechanisms of genotoxicity, DNA breakage induced by cobalt metal and especially hard metal particles, and inhibition of DNA repair by cobalt (II) ions contribute to the carcinogenic potential of cobalt compounds.

40|$|Understanding how parasites {{adapt to}} changes in host {{resistance}} is crucial to evolutionary <b>epidemiology.</b> <b>Experimental</b> {{studies have demonstrated that}} parasites are more capable of adapting to gradual, rather than sudden changes in host phenotype, as the latter may require multiple mutations that are unlikely to arise simultaneously. A key, but as yet unexplored factor is precisely how interactions between mutations (epistasis) affect parasite evolution. Here, we investigate this phenomenon in the context of infectivity range, where parasites may experience selection to infect broader sets of genotypes. When epistasis is strongly positive, we find that parasites are unlikely to evolve broader infectivity ranges if hosts exhibit sudden, rather than gradual changes in phenotype, in close agreement with empirical observations. This is due to a low probability of fixing multiple mutations that individually confer no immediate advantage. When epistasis is weaker, parasites are more likely to evolve broader infectivity ranges if hosts make sudden changes in phenotype, which can be explained by a balance between mutation supply and selection. Thus, we demonstrate that both the rate of phenotypic change in hosts and the form of epistasis between mutations in parasites are crucial in shaping the evolution of infectivity range...|$|R

The estimated relative risk for neck and low back were 11. 2 (95 % CI 1. 34 – 93. 41) and 4. 48 (95 % CI 1. 61 – 12. 42) respectively. Other association to cold exposition such as discomfort with cold draughts and thermal protective clothing were not evident in this research. The work shift, the type of contract with company and psychosocial work-related risks were not controlled in this research, which could have had some influence upon the results. The association between cold exposure and musculoskeletal problems are mainly still obscure {{and the need for}} further research is necessary from <b>experimental</b> designs and <b>epidemiology</b> studies (case-control or preferably cohort studies) that look to analyse the causes.

40|$|International audienceThe {{analysis}} of combined effects of substances or risk factors {{has been a}} subject to science {{for more than a}} century. With different goals, combined effect analysis was addressed in almost all experimental biosciences. The major theoretical foundation {{can be traced back to}} two distinct origins. First, to the work by the pharmacologist Loewe on the concept of concentration additivity and second to the biometrician Bliss and the concept of independent action. In the search for a general solution and a unified terminology the interrelations of the concepts have extensively been studied and experimental findings reviewed. Meanwhile there seems to be consensus in experimental sciences that each concept has its role in predicting combined effect of agents and both are used for hazard und risk management. In contrast, epidemiologists describe combined effects mainly in terms of interactions in regression models. Although this approach started from a probabilistic model equivalent to the concept of independent action this origin is rarely acknowledged and effect summation is usually the preferred concept nowadays. Obscure biological meaning, the scale dependency of interaction terms as well as unavoidable residual confounding are taken as reasons why no new insights in combined effect analysis are likely to occur from epidemiology. In this paper we sketch the history of ideas and the state of the arts in combined effect analysis. We point to differences and common grounds in <b>experimental</b> biosciences and <b>epidemiology...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{permutation}} testing methods have increased both {{in number of}} applications and in solving complex multivariate problems. A large number of testing problems may also be usefully and effectively solved by traditional parametric or rank-based nonparametric methods, although in relatively mild conditions their permutation counterparts are generally asymptotically {{as good as the}} best ones. Permutation tests are essentially of an exact nonparametric nature in a conditional context, where conditioning is on the pooled observed data as a set of sufficient statistics in the null hypothesis. Instead, the reference null distribution of most parametric tests is only known asymptotically. Thus, for most sample sizes of practical interest, the possible lack of efficiency of permutation solutions may be compensated by the lack of approximation of parametric counterparts. There are many complex multivariate problems (quite common in biostatistics, clinical trials, engineering, the environment, <b>epidemiology,</b> <b>experimental</b> data, industrial statistics, pharmacology, psychology, social sciences, etc.) which are difficult to solve outside the conditional framework and outside the nonparametric combination (NPC) method for dependent permutation tests. In this paper we review this method along with a number of applications in different experimental and observational situations (e. g. multi-sided alternatives, zero-inflated data and testing for a stochastic ordering) and we present properties specific to this methodology, such as: for a given number of subjects, when the number of variables diverges and the noncentrality of the combined test diverges accordingly, then the power of combination-based permutation tests converges to one. <br /...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{gap between}} the level of {{knowledge}} of health-care providers and consumers and their respective behavior. Our normal analytic methods (statistical analysis, <b>epidemiology,</b> <b>experimental</b> science) can quantify this fact but remain unable to explain it. However, an understanding of the cause would allow specific corrective action to be taken. Qualitative research methods, originally born in the human sciences, have increased the ability of researchers for understanding the complex behavior of the different health-care players. Prevention programs and other behavior-modifying initiatives based on qualified expert opinion, similar to those emanating from Regional Health Agencies (ARH) and Health-care Office Regional Unions (URCAM), often use qualitative research methods. However, this important part of the work of healthcare professionals who analyse the organisation and delivery of health-care is only infrequently published in scientific journals. This is probably {{due to the fact that}} qualitative studies do not appear to follow the normal academic standards for communication. Quantitative studies are more commonly accepted for publication even though they may overly simplify problems by trying to express reality in numbers. A qualitative presentation can more easily hide shoddy study methodology and this fact may explain why scientific journals hesitate to publish them. Nevertheless, when they utilise reproducible study designs, their procedures and results could be exchanged, discussed and published by health-care players. In this article, we suggest the quality criteria to consider for accepting articles which qualitatively analyse the organisation and delivery of health-care for publication in scientific journals...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that receptor-mediated events impact {{one or more}} stages responsible for tumor development in experimental animals and humans. Although many chemicals and endogenous hormones require receptor interactions as a necessary event in their carcinogenic activity, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and its structural analogs are the most visible examples of receptor-mediated carcinogens. TCDD, or dioxin as it is frequently called, interacts with the Ah receptor (AhR), which functions in a manner analogous to receptors for steroids. TCDD produces {{a wide spectrum of}} biochemical and toxic responses in in vitro and in vivo systems, and the Ah receptor is generally considered necessary for most if not all of these responses. Risk assessments for dioxin made by the United States and other countries throughout the world have been based on its carcinogenecity in <b>experimental</b> animals. Recently, <b>epidemiology</b> studies have indicated that TCDD is a human carcinogen at high doses. Because TCDD appears to be acting like a potent and persistent hormone agonist, it appears reasonable to incorporate mechanistic information on receptor-mediated events in risk assessments for TCDD. This information may be obtained from steroid receptor action and from molecular data on the Ah receptor. In this paper, we evaluate the scientific foundation on which mechanistic models for estimating dioxin's risks should be based. These models need to recognize the mechanisms possible for the diversity of biological responses that are initiated by a single receptor interacting with a single ligand. The U. S. EPA is currently reevaluating dioxin's risks by examining the possibility of developing biologically based models. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
