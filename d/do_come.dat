25|$|Crematogaster brevispinosa rochai is one {{subspecies}} of ant whose {{interaction with}} N. corniger has been studied. C. b. rochai lives {{in areas of}} caatinga in Brazil. No queens of the ant {{have been found in}} the nests but their larvae of all castes and sexes have been. Nests that contain C. b. rochai do not have a termite queen in either. It can therefore be concluded that both the ants and termites are members of polydomous colonies that each have multiple nest sites. The ants and termites are segregated within the nest and do not normally come into contact with each other. C. b. rochai plug channels at the boundary of the areas they occupy to cause this segregation. On occasions when the ants and termites <b>do</b> <b>come</b> into contact with each other (e.g. if the nest is broken into) they are rarely aggressive and tend to avoid each other instead. It has been hypothesised that the hydrocarbon content of their cuticles may have changed to allow them to live together relatively peacefully.|$|E

[...] On 12January therefore, Kent enlisted the aid of the two physicians who attended Fanny in her last days, and with Broughton, went to Cock Lane. [...] On the house's upper floor Elizabeth Parsons was publicly undressed, and with her younger sister was put to bed. [...] The audience sat around the bed, positioned in the centre of the room. [...] They were warned that the ghost was sensitive to disbelief and told that they should accord it due respect. [...] When the séance began, a relative of Parsons, Mary Frazer, ran around the room shouting [...] "Fanny, Fanny, why don't you come? [...] <b>Do</b> <b>come,</b> pray Fanny, come; dear Fanny, come!" [...] When nothing happened, Moore told the group the ghost would not come as they were making too much noise.
