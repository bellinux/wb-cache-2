The image went viral after it was Photoshopped into various [...] "impressive" [...] places and situations, e.g. {{on top of the}} Great Wall of China and standing next to Usain Bolt. Maroney stated that she found the Internet meme [...] "kinda funny". Maroney later poked fun at the meme on various occasions including appearances on The Late Show with David Letterman, The Colbert Report, , Extra, and most notably when she {{and the rest of the}} U.S. Gymnastics team met United States President Barack Obama at the White House in November 2012. She and President Obama posed for a photo together, both making the same pursed-lips expression. The podium picture made the top spot on Yahoo's list of [...] "Most Viral Photos" [...] of 2012.|$|E
60|$|And {{still at}} times she would smear {{him with the}} name of black (to his delight when he learned the reason). That was when some podgy red-sealed blue-crossed letter arrived from Vailima, {{inviting}} me to journey thither. (His directions were, ‘You take the boat at San Francisco, and then my place is the second to the left.’) Even London seemed to her to carry me so far away that I often took a week to the journey (the first six days in getting her used to the idea), and these letters terrified her. It was not the finger of Jim Hawkins she now saw beckoning me across the seas, it was John Silver, waving a crutch. Seldom, I believe, did I read straight through one of these Vailima letters; when in the middle I suddenly remembered who was upstairs and what she was probably doing, and I ran to her, three steps at a jump, to find <b>her,</b> <b>lips</b> <b>pursed,</b> hands folded, a picture of gloom.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>pursed</b> {{as if to}} spit venom at the word; pursed they remained. All she did was to {{take her}} glove and rub hard at {{a spot on the}} window-pane. She rubbed as if she would rub {{something}} out for ever--some stain, some indelible contamination. Indeed, the spot remained for all her rubbing, and back she sank with the shudder and the clutch of the arm I had come to expect. Something impelled me to take my glove and rub my window. There, too, was a little speck on the glass. For all my rubbing it remained. And then the spasm went through me; I crooked my arm and plucked at the middle of my back. My skin, too, felt like the damp chicken's skin in the poulterer's shop-window; one spot between the shoulders itched and irritated, felt clammy, felt raw. Could I reach it? Surreptitiously I tried. She saw me. A smile of infinite irony, infinite sorrow, flitted and faded from her face. But she had communicated, shared her secret, passed her poison; she would speak no more. Leaning back in my corner, shielding my eyes from her eyes, seeing only the slopes and hollows, greys and purples, of the winter's landscape, I read her message, deciphered her secret, reading it beneath her gaze.|$|E
2500|$|The 1899 {{portrait}} of Williams depicts her wearing a pleated black {{dress with a}} high white collar. Her hair is in a tight bun, set against a dark brown background. Williams is turned slightly to the right, with a strong light cast {{on that side of}} <b>her</b> body. <b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> are <b>pursed</b> and <b>her</b> brow is furled; her expression is nearly a scowl. Dark circles are visible under her eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{broke into}} a trot, and Madge's <b>lips</b> <b>pursed,</b> forming an avenue for the caressing sound {{that it was the}} will of her to send forth. But the caressing sound was not made. She was impelled to look at her husband, and she saw the sternness with which he watched <b>her.</b> The <b>pursed</b> <b>lips</b> relaxed, and she sighed inaudibly.|$|R
60|$|Larry and Nora {{are left}} {{together}} for the first time since his arrival. She looks at him with a smile that perishes as she sees him aimlessly rocking his chair, and reflecting, evidently not about <b>her,</b> with his <b>lips</b> <b>pursed</b> as if he were whistling. With a catch in her throat she takes up Aunt Judy's knitting, and makes a pretence of going on with it.|$|R

Our reverend friend and I {{understand}} each other. He will make allowances for a sensitive woman, {{who has had}} sad experience of conversions in her own household. My eldest daughter, Father Benwell--a poor foolish creature--was converted into a nunnery. The last time I saw her (she used to be sweetly pretty; my dear husband quite adored her)--the last time I saw her she had a red nose, and, what is even more revolting at her age, a double chin. She received me with <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>pursed</b> up, and {{her eyes on the}} ground, and she was insolent enough to say that she would pray for me. I am not a furious old man with a long white beard, and I don't curse my daughter and rush out into a thunderstorm afterward--but I know what King Lear felt, and I have struggled with hysterics just as he did. With your wonderful insight into human nature, I am sure you will sympathize with and forgive me. Mr. Penrose, as my daughter tells me, behaved in the most gentleman-like manner. I make the same appeal to your kind forbearance. The bare prospect of our dear friend here becoming a Catholic--" ...|$|E

60|$|That evening, {{some young}} people {{came in to}} tea, {{two of the four}} big Catherwood boys, Anne Brinsmade and her brother Jack, Puss Russell and Bert, and Eugenie Renault. But Virginia lost her temper. In an evil moment Puss Russell started the subject of the young Yankee who had {{deprived}} her of Hester. Puss was ably seconded by Jack Brinsmade, whose reputation as a tormentor extended far back into his boyhood. In vain; did Anne, the peacemaker, try to quench him, while the big Catherwoods and Bert Russell laughed incessantly. No wonder that Virginia was angry. She would not speak to Puss as that young lady bade her good night. And the Colonel, coming home from an evening with Mr. Brinsmade, found his daughter in an armchair, staring into the sitting-room fire. There was no other light in the room Her chin was in her hand, and <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> were <b>pursed.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The {{sunlight}} {{was not too}} kind to her, but at evening parties, {{where the}} lighting has been well considered, I have seen her look quite girlish. At her best she was not beautiful, but at her worst there was about her an air of breeding and distinction that always saved her from being passed over, and she dressed to perfection. In character she was the typical society woman: always charming, generally insincere. She went to Kensington for her religion and to Mayfair for her morals; accepted her literature from Mudie's and her art from the Grosvenor Gallery; and could and would gabble philanthropy, philosophy, and politics with equal fluency at every five-o'clock tea-table she visited. Her ideas could always be guaranteed as the very latest, and her opinion {{as that of the}} person to whom she was talking. Asked by a famous novelist one afternoon, at the Pioneer Club, to give him some idea of her, little Mrs. Bund, the painter's wife, had remained for a few moments with <b>her</b> pretty <b>lips</b> <b>pursed,</b> and had then said: ...|$|R
60|$|Such a busy {{little woman}} as she was! So full of self-importance and {{trying so hard}} not to smile, or seem {{uncertain}} about anything! It was a perfect treat to Tom to see her with her brows knit, and <b>her</b> rosy <b>lips</b> <b>pursed</b> up, kneading away at the crust, rolling it out, cutting it up into strips, lining the basin with it, shaving it off fine round the rim, chopping up the steak into small pieces, raining down pepper and salt upon them, packing them into the basin, pouring in cold water for gravy, and never venturing to steal a look in his direction, lest her gravity should be disturbed; until, at last, the basin being quite full and only wanting the top crust, she clapped her hands all covered with paste and flour, at Tom, and burst out heartily into such a charming little laugh of triumph, that the pudding need have had no other seasoning to commend it to the taste of any reasonable man on earth.|$|R
60|$|It was Avice Caro, {{as she had}} {{appeared}} during the summer month or two which he had spent {{with her on the}} island twenty years before this time, <b>her</b> young <b>lips</b> <b>pursed</b> up, <b>her</b> hands meekly folded. The effect of the glass was to lend to the picture much of the softness characteristic of the original. He remembered when it was taken--during one afternoon they had spent together at a neighbouring watering-place, when he had suggested her sitting to a touting artist on the sands, there being nothing else for them to do. A long contemplation of the likeness completed in his emotions what the letter had begun. He loved the woman dead and inaccessible as he had never loved her in life. He had thought of her but at distant intervals during the twenty years since that parting occurred, and only as somebody he could have wedded. Yet now the times of youthful friendship with her, in which he had learnt every note of her innocent nature, flamed up into a yearning and passionate attachment, embittered by regret beyond words.|$|R

5000|$|Tongue Blocking and <b>Lip</b> <b>Pursing</b> are two {{different}} ways of playing the harmonica with your mouth. Tongue Blocking is when put your mouth over three or more holes on the harmonica but you cover all the holes but one with your tongue. This technique gives you the ability to play a variety of sounds. <b>Lip</b> <b>Pursing</b> is playing a single note by <b>pursing</b> the <b>lips</b> and covering only one hole. The Tongue Blocking Technique is used by Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson I (John Lee Williamson), Sonny Boy Williamson II (Aleck Ford [...] "Rice" [...] Miller), Big Walter Horton, James Cotton, George Smith,Taj Mahal, among many others. The <b>Lip</b> <b>Pursing</b> Technique is used by Paul Butterfield, Junior Wells, Sugar Blue, Stevie Wonder, Jason Ricci among many others.|$|R

60|$|Early in the {{afternoon}} on finding that her patient was little better, my landlady {{went off to the}} chemist's to get me some physic; I could bear inactivity no longer, and rose and dressed. The fire was low, the room sluggish, when in the dusk, as I sat dismally brooding in my chair, the door opened, and a stranger came in with my tea. She was dressed in black, and was carrying a light. With that raised in one hand, and my tea-tray held between finger and thumb of the other, she looked at me with face a little sidelong. Her hair was dark above her clear pale skin, and drawn, without a fringe, smoothly over her brows. Her eyes were almost unnaturally light in colour. I looked at her in astonishment; she was new in my world. She put the tray on my table, poked the fire into a blaze, blew out her candle at a single puff from <b>her</b> <b>pursed</b> <b>lips,</b> and seating herself on the hearthrug, clasped her hands round her knees.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this pilot}} study was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of measuring the change in magnitude, speed, and motion similarity of facial animations in head and neck oncology patients, before and after lip split mandibulotomy. Seven subjects (four males, three females) aged 42 – 80 years were recruited. The {{subjects were asked to}} perform four facial animations (maximal smile, <b>lip</b> <b>purse,</b> cheek puff, and grimace) from rest to maximal position. The animations were captured using a Di 4 D motion capture system, which recorded 60 frames/s. Nine facial soft tissue landmarks were manually digitized on the first frame of the three-dimensional image of each animation by the same operator and were tracked automatically for the sequential frames. The intra-operator digitization error was within 0. 4  mm. <b>Lip</b> <b>purse</b> and maximal smile animations showed the least amount of change in magnitude (0. 2  mm) following surgery; speed difference was least for smile animation (− 0. 1  mm/s). Motion similarity was found to be highest for <b>lip</b> <b>purse</b> animation (0. 78). This pilot study confirmed that surgery did influence the dynamics of facial animations, and the Di 4 D capture system can be regarded as a feasible objective tool for assessing the impact of surgical interventions on facial soft tissue movements...|$|R

If four seconds is too long, simply exhale for twice the length of time that you inhale.|$|R

60|$|In his {{own room}} he sat with his open hands reposing on his knees, his <b>lips</b> <b>pursed</b> up, and the {{horizontal}} furrows on his forehead marked very heavily.
