25|$|Following {{his third}} regeneration, the Doctor briefly becomes delirious and then falls {{unconscious}} {{in front of}} Sarah Jane Smith and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart of UNIT. The Brigadier has Lieutenant Harry Sullivan take the Doctor into his care. Soon, the Doctor wakes, eludes Harry, and tries to sneak off in his TARDIS, but the Brigadier and Sarah Jane stop him, convincing him to help in finding the culprit in the theft of top secret plans for a <b>disintegrator</b> gun. The Brigadier takes the Doctor to the Ministry of Defence advanced research centre where the plans were stored, where the Doctor observes crushed flowers and a rectangular footprint. UNIT sets to protect factories where critical parts for the gun are manufactured, but find the culprit is able to outwit them, including burrowing up underground to collect the final component necessary for the weapon.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the {{production}} on Enterprise, there were rumours that William Shatner {{would make a}} guest appearance. During season four, this idea was raised once again with the Reeves-Stevens suggesting that the tantalus field (previously {{thought to be a}} <b>disintegrator)</b> seen in The Original Series episode [...] "" [...] actually sent its victims back in time to a penal colony in the regular universe. This in turn would allow Shatner to reprise his role as the Mirror Universe version of Captain James T. Kirk. He pitched this to Braga and Berman, but instead they pitched another idea back to the actor in which he could play the chef of the Enterprise, who was taken to the future by Daniels and required to impersonate Kirk. After they couldn't settle on an idea, the Mirror Universe concept was reworked into the two-part episode [...] "In a Mirror, Darkly".|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "Foo Fighters" [...] {{was taken}} from the {{description}} World War II aircraft pilots would use to describe various UFOs. This science fiction theme is further continued with the name of Grohl's Capitol Records imprint, Roswell Records, a reference to the city of Roswell, New Mexico, known for the Roswell UFO incident of 1947; and the album cover done by Grohl's then-wife, photographer Jennifer Youngblood, featuring a Buck Rogers XZ-38 <b>Disintegrator</b> Pistol. Some reviewers considered the gun on the cover as insensitive, given Kurt Cobain died by shooting himself, but Grohl dutifully disregarded it as just a coincidence. [...] Goldsmith later explained, [...] "It was all pretty much based on the whole Foo Fighters thing—Roswell, the space stuff, an antique Buck Rogers raygun. It's really a completely separate thing. Dave wasn't even conscious of that." [...] Despite Grohl being the album's only contributor, at Capitol's insistence the liner notes included a picture of the full band that Grohl had recruited.|$|E

500|$|Similarly, Dan Stapleton of IGN became bored {{when his}} superhero protagonist had little [...] "to overcome", and {{ultimately}} likened {{the game to}} [...] "enabling god-like cheat codes" [...] in its predecessor. He wrote {{that it was very}} difficult to die, given the large amount of power-ups dropped by enemies, and that the otherwise praiseworthy features from Saints Row: The Third felt [...] "vestigial" [...] when outmoded by superpowers. Stapleton said the player received the powers too early, which let the player play without caring about the city, and thus removed the [...] "sense of place and character it had in the previous game". He considered the game's large number of collectibles an acknowledgement of this hole, which while originally rewarding, quickly becomes a [...] "chore". Stapleton praised the Red Faction-style <b>Disintegrator</b> and Abductor guns, though considered the dubstep gun an [...] "ineffective disappointment". As a symbol, though, Polygon described the dubstep gun as [...] "iconic" [...] of Saints Row IV.|$|E

He stumbles into an incident where he rescues a girl from a gangster named Rudnick, who had murdered the girl's father. She tells him about her father's discovery: the Loc-Nar, an artifact over which people are killing each other. Harry takes the girl back to his apartment, where she climbs into his bed and has sex with him. The next day, one of his fares is Rudnick, who threatens Harry {{if he does not}} cooperate. The girl decides to sell the Loc-Nar to Rudnick and split the proceeds with Harry. At the exchange, Rudnick takes the Loc-Nar out of its case and is disintegrated. Meanwhile, the girl informs Harry that she's keeping the money for herself and pulls a gun on him. Harry is forced to use his <b>disintegrator</b> on her. He keeps the money and writes it up as a [...] "two-day ride with one hell of a tip." ...|$|E
2500|$|Winters sends a list {{of demands}} to the world governments and gives them thirty minutes to comply, and {{subsequently}} orders Kettlewell to connect to the launch computers and prepare to send the launch codes. Kettlewell, who never expected their plan {{to get to this}} stage, hesitates, and in the ensuing discussion, Sarah Jane and Harry attempt to escape with Kettlewell's assistance. Winters orders K1 to stop the pair, but the robot, already conflicted to its programming, inadvertently fires the <b>disintegrator</b> gun at Kettlewell, killing him. The death of its creator puts K1 in a further confused state, falling to the ground and apparently shutting down. [...] Winters attempts to program the countdown, but the Doctor arrives and successfully counters it. As UNIT forces take Winters and Jellicoe away, K1 reactivates and begins to attack UNIT. K1 seeks out Sarah Jane to protect her, a result of an Oedipus complex it developed from Sarah Jane's previous compassion, according to the Doctor. UNIT fires the <b>disintegrator</b> gun at the robot but the blast is absorbed, causing the robot to grow to an enormous size. Realising the growth is due to the living metal that Kettlewell used in constructing K1, the Doctor races back to Kettlewell's lab to synthesize a batch of metal-biodegradable virus, a side discovery made by Kettlewell. The Doctor throws a bucket of solution containing the virus onto K1, and the robot slowly shrinks down in size before it vanishes.|$|E

After they escape, they discover an ultralight aircraft, which they use {{to search for the}} Dark Overlord and Beverly. At the laboratory, the Dark Overlord ties Beverly down to a metal bed and plans to transfer another one of his kind into her body with the dimension machine. Howard and Phil arrive and apparently destroy the Dark Overlord with an experimental [...] "neutron disintegrator". However, the creature has only been forced out of Jenning's body. The Dark Overlord reveals his true form at this point. Howard fires the neutron <b>disintegrator</b> at the hideous beast, obliterating him. He then destroys the laser spectroscope, preventing more Dark Overlords from arriving on Earth, but also ruining Howard's only chance of returning to his planet. Howard then becomes Beverly's manager, hires Phil as an employee on her tour, and plays guitar with Beverly on stage.|$|E
2500|$|Unknown to UNIT, Winters and Jellicoe have {{instructed}} K1 to kill Cabinet Minister Joseph Chambers as [...] "an {{enemy of}} humanity", {{and to use}} the completed <b>disintegrator</b> gun to steal papers from his personal safe. UNIT discovers this death, and the Brigadier explains the importance of Chambers; the stolen papers were launch codes for the nuclear weapons of the major nations, given voluntarily to British as a neutral entity to only be released in the time of great need. Further, Winters, Jellicoe, and others of the Think Tank are found to be members of the Scientific Reform Society, seeking to put scientists in charge of the world believing they can make better decisions for humanity than the current governments. Learning of a Reform meeting that night, UNIT prepares to move out, while Sarah Jane, after discovering Kettlewell is also a member, convinces him to go to the meeting to allow her to sneak into it.|$|E

6000|$|This is {{perfectly}} true; much as Lönnrot botched and vamped the Finnish lays {{he made no}} epic out of them. But, as it is true, how did the late Athenian drudge of Pisistratus succeed where Lönnrot failed? [...] "In the dovetailing of the ODYSSEY we see the work of one mind," [...] says Sir Richard. [Footnote: Homer, p. 129.] This mind cannot have been the property of any one but a great poet, obviously, as the Odyssey is confessedly [...] "an artistic whole." [...] Consequently the <b>disintegrators</b> of the Odyssey, when they are logical, are reduced to averring that the poem is an exceedingly inartistic whole, a whole not artistic at all. While Mr. Leaf calls it [...] "a model of skilful construction," [...] Wilamowitz Mollendorff denounces it {{as the work of}} [...] "a slenderly-gifted botcher," [...] of about 650 B.C., a century previous to Mr. Leaf's Athenian editor.|$|R

40|$|Aim of this {{research}} work was to develop mouth dissolve tablet that disintegrates rapidly in mouth and formulate tasteless complex of drug Cefixime. Cefixime is an oral third generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It is used to treat gonorrhea, tonsillitis, and pharyngitis. The tablets were prepared using different concentration of disintegrant by direct compression method. The superdisintegrants {{used in this study}} were Sodium starch glycolate (SSG), cropovidone (CP), Cross‐carmillose sodium (CCS) and Kyron T 314. The formulated tablets were evaluated for uniformity of weight, thickness, hardness, friability, wetting time, water absorption ratio, disintegration time (DT) and dissolution study. The conventional tablets of Cefixime were prepared by using the same excipients,without addition of Super fast tablet <b>disintegrators</b> and were evaluated in the similar way. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that the tablet formulation (batch FDT 5) showed Disintegration time of 30 ± 2. 4 seconds in vitro. Also the hardness, friability and dissolution rate of prepared tablets (batch FDT 5) were found to be acceptable according to standard limits...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: The {{importance}} of Nitric oxide (NO) andAsymmetric dimethylargininie (ADMA) in pathophysiology of Sickle celldisease (SCD) is being increasingly clarified. Since {{very few of}} the studieshave been conducted in the word and no study has been carried out in Iran,especially in Khuzestan province where is the main center of Sickle Celldisorder (SCD) in Iran, We decided to conduct the present study. Material and Methods: EDTA anticoagulated plasma samples were obtainedfrom 35 healthy controls (Hb AA), 35 heterozygous (HB AS) and 35 homozygous (HB SS) sickle cell anemia patients. Plasma concentration of NOwas measured by Colorimetric and Griess reaction and the concentration ofADMA by employing ELISA method. Then the results were analyzed by tstudenttest and OneWay ANOVA. Results: There is a positive significance correlation between Hemoglobin(Hb) and NO in SS (r= 0. 703) and AS (r= 0. 366) groups. Also, a negativecorrelation between Hb and ADMA in SS (r=- 0. 786) and AS (r=- 0. 478) groups is seen. No correlation is found between these parameters in AAgroup. Conclusion: The prevention of Hb concentration decrease and prescription ofNO donors and (or) ADMA <b>disintegrators</b> can be helpful for improvingclinical signs of sickle cell patients.

40|$|Excess sludge {{treatment}} and disposal {{is currently a}} major challenge in wastewater treatment plants due to associated high costs and environmental regulation factors. Sludge disintegration technology (e. g., ultrasonic sludge <b>disintegrators),</b> {{can result in a}} significant reduction of the excess sludge produced in both municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants when integrated as a solubilisation step in the sludge recycle of the activated sludge plant. For modelling the process of ultrasonic sludge disintegration, knowledge about the release of soluble COD (sCOD) and soluble Kjeldahl nitrogen (sKN) {{as a function of the}} applied specific ultrasonic energy (ES, kJ/kg DS) provides insufficient information to result in a successful sludge disintegration model that is consistent with existing IWA Activated Sludge Models (ASM). In the research proposed in this paper, it was shown that respirometric data can be used to characterize the different COD fractions that are released and converted during the ultrasonic treatment of waste activated sludge. From the experiments it was concluded that the ultrasonically released COD in the supernatant liquid consists for approximately 70 % of slowly biodegradable COD (XS), mainly in the form of colloidal particulate material, 20 % of readily biodegradable COD (SS), and a remaining part of inert soluble COD (Si). Based on the performed COD fractionation experiments, also a saturation-based solubilisation model was proposed that is compatible with existing ASMs and that describes the ultrasonic sludge disintegration as a function of the specific energy (ES). status: publishe...|$|R
