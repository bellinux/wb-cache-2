5|$|The {{reason for}} this is that the {{pressure}} difference across a fluid interface is proportional to the mean curvature, as seen in the Young–Laplace equation. For an open soap film, the pressure <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.|$|E

If the trip {{costs more than}} $3.60 the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> deducted from the cash balance of a SmarTrip card, possibly after the necessary value is added at the Exitfare machine. A non-negative stored value is required to enter the Metrorail system.|$|E
40|$|There <b>are</b> <b>differences</b> {{between human}} beings, {{and some of}} these <b>differences</b> <b>are,</b> for many, a matter of identity. Some people are men, and some are white. Some people are poor, others are wealthy. These identity-constituting <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> deeply {{connected}} with different kinds of injustices. Susan Hekman's main contention in The Future of <b>Differences</b> <b>is</b> that a new epistemology is required if we are to acknowledge all these differences (p. 27) and, consequently, address these injustices...|$|R
30|$|Results were {{presented}} as mean ± SEM. For comparison between two groups, <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> analyzed by 2 -tailed Student’s t-test. <b>Differences</b> <b>were</b> considered significant at {{a value of}} P < 0.05.|$|R
30|$|Intergroup {{analysis}} showed time dependent {{significant differences between}} the groups.

5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – The {{difference between the}} expected and received frequency of transmissions. The <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> caused by doppler shift as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink. This measure can be analysed to determine where along the BTO rings the aircraft was located.|$|E

5|$|Challenge mode employs similar {{gameplay}} {{to that of}} the Story mode. The <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} gameplay for Challenge mode is faster-paced, offers more puzzles, and sacrifices any storyline in this mode. It consists of 30 levels and players must fulfill certain conditions before succeeding. Each level lasts only a few minutes, offering more exciting, yet harder, gameplay. The time needed for players to complete a level is recorded in an online leaderboard which can be viewed by other players.|$|E
30|$|As can be seen, {{the number}} of {{correlation}} coefficients with context constructs exhibiting differences between the rotation results and the original results varies across the three subject domains. The smallest number of <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> recorded for mathematics—a minor domain in PISA 2006. Here, only 19 <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> larger than 0.03. For science, 28 differences exceed that size. The domain recording the most <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> reading. The only sizeable difference for a country is that for Hong Kong SAR.

30|$|Significant <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> {{found between}} pre-op and 3 rd day VAS values and also pre-op and 1 st month VAS values. No {{significant}} <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found between pre-op and 6 th month VAS values.|$|R
5|$|Cockatoos {{have a large}} bill, {{which is}} kept sharp by rasping the two mandibles {{together}} when resting. The bill is complemented by a large muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill {{so that they can}} be de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the lower mandible applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in place and the upper mandible acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the mandibles sideways. The bills of male cockatoos are generally slightly larger than those of their female counterparts, but this size <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> quite marked in the palm cockatoo.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The grey fox and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> not strongly supported.|$|E
5|$|Early {{drafts of}} the novel {{entitled}} Trimalchio: An Early Version of The Great Gatsby have been published. A notable difference between the Trimalchio draft and The Great Gatsby is a less complete failure of Gatsby's dream in Trimalchio. Another <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> that the argument between Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby is more even, although Daisy still returns to Tom.|$|E

5|$|Genes with a {{most recent}} common ancestor, {{and thus a}} shared {{evolutionary}} ancestry, are known as homologs. These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they are known as paralogous genes, or {{are the result of}} divergence of the genes after a speciation event, where they are known as orthologous genes, and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms. It is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes, although the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> minimal.|$|E
5|$|Herbal medicines, as a whole, {{are poorly}} {{supported}} by evidence. The herbal treatments Devil's claw and white willow {{may reduce the}} number of individuals reporting high levels of pain; however, for those taking pain relievers, this <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> not significant. Capsicum, in the form of either a gel or a plaster cast, has been found to reduce pain and increase function.|$|E
5|$|Hill plotted {{the remains}} of 102 lodges. Pike {{reported}} finding 44 lodges at the village; the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> {{probably due to the}} abandonment or destruction of lodges and the building of new ones on different sites. At least 90 graves have been investigated by archaeologists; an estimated 75–100 additional graves are thought to have been opened by relic hunters.|$|E
30|$|The only {{significant}} between group <b>differences</b> <b>was</b> {{for a greater}} reduction in uterine volume at 6 [*]months in the E group.

5|$|In 2016, Cathay Pacific, Dragonair's Parent Company, {{announced}} {{that they would be}} re-branding Dragonair to Cathay Dragon. For this change, a new livery has been adopted. The new livery is similar to Cathay Pacific's new livery in the tail logo and font. The major <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> instead of the Cathay Pacific green theme, it has a light maroon theme. The titles say Cathay Dragon along with Chinese lettering reading the name. Dragonair's Dragon logo has been retained and appears next to the cockpit windows. Airbus A330-300, B-HYQ, was the first aircraft to wear the new livery.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, Karelian Trains, a {{joint venture}} by VR and RZhD, started a new service linking Helsinki to St. Petersburg, Russia using {{a new model of}} the Pendolino called the Sm6 Allegro. The Sm6 is {{technically}} based on the Pendolino Nuovo, but its looks are similar to the Sm3. The most significant <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> that an Sm6 unit is composed of seven carriages. The train is capable of dual-voltage running due to differences between the electric systems of the Finnish and Russian rail network and is equipped with four pantographs.|$|E
