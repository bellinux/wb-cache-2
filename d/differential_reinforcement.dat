25|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of low {{response}} rate (DRL) described by Ferster and Skinner {{is used to}} encourage low rates of responding. It is derived from research in operant conditioning that provides an excellent opportunity to measure the hyperactive child's ability to inhibit behavioral responding. Hyperactive children were relatively unable to perform efficiently on the task, and this deficit endured regardless of age, IQ, or experimental condition. Therefore, {{it can be used}} to discriminate accurately between teacher rated and parent rated hyperactive and nonhyperactive children. In this procedure, responses that occur before a set time interval has passed are not reinforced and reset the time required between behaviors.|$|E
2500|$|Direct tuition (differential reinforcement): The first {{concept is}} {{represented}} through direct tuition, {{also known as}} <b>differential</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Early in a child’s development, parents are already encouraging gender-appropriate activities and discouraging cross-gender activities. Adults reward children when they display gender-appropriate behavior and punish children when they display cross-gender behavior. The idea of direct tuition expresses that gender-typed behavior begins with the child adopting views they learn from their parents. Therefore, parents reinforce the developmental of gender stereotypes by providing gender-appropriate toys and activities. Adults influence a child’s gender identification when they encourage gender-typed behaviors like teaching “boys how to be boys and girls how to be girls”.|$|E

A <b>differential</b> negative <b>reinforcement</b> procedure was implemented for specific conditions that evoked problem behavior.

40|$|The study {{examines}} two {{approaches to the}} development of behavioral strategies: i) the evolutionary approach manifested in a Genetic Algorithm, which accounts for gradual development and simultaneous refinement of an entire population; and ii) the behavioral learning approach, which focuses on reinforcements at the individual's level. The current work is part from an ongoing project dealing with the development of strategic behavior. The reported study evaluates the potential of <b>differential</b> <b>reinforcements</b> to provide probabilistic noisy Tit-For-Tat strategies with the motivation to adopt a pure Tit-For-Tat strategy. Results show that provocability and forgiveness, the traits that account for Tit-For-Tat's successes, also prevent it from gaining relative fitness and become an attractor for noisy (non-perfect) Tit-For-Tat strategies.

40|$|Twenty-three pigeons were {{subjected}} {{to a series of}} procedures in which the key-peck's effects ranged from immediate, <b>differential</b> food <b>reinforcement,</b> through delayed reinforcement, the production of stimulus changes with and without probable secondary reinforcement, the prevention of food presentation (“food-avoidance”), to extinction. Neither primary nor secondary food reinforcement appeared to be essential for the maintenance or acquisition of key pecking. The food-avoidance contingency failed to suppress responding in any subject. Only complete extinction, when pecking produced neither food nor stimulus changes, eliminated all pecking for most subjects. A combination of stimulus-change reinforcement and food reinforcement appeared to account for the results, but only if it could be assumed that the presence of food in a procedure enhanced the reinforcing power of stimulus change, whether or not the food was also dependent upon responding. Such an interaction between reinforcers may be involved in the phenomenon of autoshaping...|$|R
40|$|We {{extended}} {{research on}} the role of noncontingent positive reinforcement following a functional analysis of attention-maintained self-injurious behavior to self-injury maintained by negative reinforcement in 2 young males with developmental disabilities. During a pretreatment functional analysis, each participant's self-injury was shown to be differentially sensitive to escape from instructional activities as negative reinforcement. During noncontingent escape, escape from learning activities was provided on a fixed-time schedule that was not influenced by the participant's behavior. One participant was also exposed to <b>differential</b> negative <b>reinforcement</b> of other behavior. During this condition, escape from instructional activities was provided contingent on the omission of self-injury for prespecified intervals. Results showed that the provision of escape, even when noncontingent, resulted in significant reductions in self-injury. These results are particularly interesting in light of the experimental history of noncontingent reinforcement as a control rather than as a therapeutic procedure. Noncontingent escape is discussed as a form of extinction that may be less likely than other forms of extinction to produce severe side effects...|$|R

An emergent theory of MI is proposed that emphasizes two specific active components: a relational component focused on empathy and the interpersonal spirit of MI, and a technical component involving the <b>differential</b> evocation and <b>reinforcement</b> of client change talk.

50|$|Time-out is one {{behavior}} {{control method}} based on removing positive reinforcement {{for a brief}} time. Less elaborate methods from the same class like tactical ignoring, or planned ignoring, also can be effective in cases where parental/care-giver attention is the positive reinforcement for negative behavior. This class of methods are more effective if the child gets a significant amount positive reinforcement (praise, attention) for good behavior. All punishment procedures can evoke other problem behaviors, damage rapport, or evoke escape or avoidant behaviors. For this, and other ethical reasons, behavior analysts exhaust all options for using <b>differential</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and/or extinction procedures to reduce problem behavior, before considering the use of punishment procedures.|$|E

The research also assessed the short- and long-term effects of the laboratory procedures on children 2 ̆ 7 s behavior in a free-play setting. Subjects were 9 pairs of preschool-aged children. In the laboratory situation pairs of subjects performed a block-stacking task which allowed them to respond either cooperatively or independently. Following baseline periods of varying lengths, the pairs of children were exposed to one of three videotapes of cooperative models. In Tape 1 adult models demonstrated cooperative behavior, but exhibited no verbal behavior. In Tape 2 the models made positive statements about cooperation contiguous with the demonstration of cooperative behavior. In Tape 3 the models demonstrated cooperation, made contiguous positive statements about cooperation, and in addition, they received <b>differential</b> positive <b>reinforcement</b> for cooperation. Although three of nine teams showed a significant increase in mutually cooperative responding, consistent multiple baseline control was not demonstrated. Therefore, it could not be conclusively stated that the videotaped cooperative models were effective in increasing children 1 s mutually cooperative responding in the laboratory.

In this study, an alternating treatment design was used to evaluate the effects of varied rates of teacher-presented demands (1 s, 5 s, 10 s) on the occurrence of problem behavior, opportunities to respond, responses emitted, accuracy of responding, and magnitude and rate of reinforcement for two children with autism. Results indicated that fast presentation rate (1 s) resulted in lower rates of problem behavior, higher frequencies of instructional demands, higher frequencies of participant responding, and greater magnitudes and rates of <b>reinforcement.</b> <b>Differential</b> effects on accuracy of responding across conditions were not observed.
