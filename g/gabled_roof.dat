5|$|The pyramid has a T-shaped {{substructure}} with a descending corridor {{leading to}} a chamber with a <b>gabled</b> <b>roof.</b> Similarly to the main pyramid, the substructure was constructed in a shallow open pit dug into the ground before the pyramid construction started and is therefore located just below ground-level.|$|E
5|$|The smokehouse, {{measuring}} about , is {{adjacent to}} the kitchen addition. It is set into a hillside, allowing at-grade entry to its two levels. Built of square-cut logs with white chinking atop a rubble masonry foundation, the smokehouse is topped with a standing seam metal <b>gabled</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
5|$|A brick privy with a <b>gabled</b> <b>roof</b> clad in {{corrugated}} asbestos sheeting {{is located}} {{to the north}} of the cottage building. It was probably constructed circa 1930. Further north is the workshop building, which also housed the electricity generators at one point, dating from the 1950s. It features a flat and skillion roof, and concrete mounting blocks. Its most recent use was as a fishermen's cabin.|$|E

5|$|Chamunda Devi Temple {{is located}} in a {{prominent}} position on the spur of Shah Madar range of hills, opposite to the Chamba town. It was built by Raja Umed Singh, and was completed in 1762. It is the only wooden temple with <b>gabled</b> <b>roof</b> (single storied) in Chamba, while all others in the town are built from stone in the north Indian Nagara architectural style.|$|E
5|$|Monds Roller Mills {{building}} is a four-level, three-story, bluestone building with an iron <b>gabled</b> <b>roof</b> built c1846 by John Kinder Archer. The mill, and its associated storage and transportation needs, was the main employer in Carrick for many years. It was the last mill in Tasmania to be powered by water.|$|E
5|$|The smokehouse is {{a square}} two-story {{building}} with a hipped roof, and is believed to date to the early 19th century. East of the smokehouse, a 1-story {{building with a}} three bay facade and a <b>gabled</b> <b>roof</b> {{was used as a}} post office in the late 19th century, and may have served as a schoolhouse originally. The manager's farmhouse stands 2 stories high and is L-shaped with a porch. The springhouse is also 2 stories.|$|E

50|$|Ternopil {{construction}} {{styles are}} considered a mix of Carpathian and Kiev styles. Two styles prevail: Ternopil Nave Style and Ternopil Cruciform Style. The nave style used a long rectangular shape with <b>gabled</b> <b>roofing</b> on opposite ends with a small decorative onion dome, often not visible from inside the church. The cruciform style uses an equidistant cruciform pattern with a structural central onion dome, and <b>gabled</b> <b>roofing</b> over each cruciform section. While constructed in wood in villages, this style often used masonry in urban areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is a well-composed example of high Victorian Gothic, with architectural language of pointed arched windows, steeply pitched <b>gabled</b> <b>roofs,</b> decorative brickwork and picturesque massing and siting.|$|R
5|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{taken into}} account when designing the building include the polycarbonate cladding, used for natural light and passive heating; and a hydronic heating and cooling system using the constant temperature of the sea water below the pontoon. As a floating structure, {{it will not be}} affected by rises in the sea level. The <b>gabled</b> <b>roof</b> design is intended to fit in with the other buildings in Sullivans Cove including PW1, Elizabeth Street Pier and the Mac02 Cruise Terminal– which themselves are based on the historic use of the area as a freight port.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundations}} that Jackson discovered {{during the}} excavations were left exposed {{for the benefit}} of visitors and larger numbers of tourists began to come to the castle to see the ruins, including Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte in 1846. The lead coffins in the chapel crypt were popular with tourists, although the coffins were extensively damaged by those visitors keen to see the contents inside. The south-west tower, completely covered by thick ivy, collapsed in 1842, after local children accidentally set fire to the vegetation that was, by then, holding the tower together. Battlements were added to the east gatehouse during this period, transforming the appearance of its original <b>gabled</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} at {{the north}} side is a short descending corridor lined with red granite followed by a passageway ending at the burial chamber with its <b>gabled</b> <b>roof</b> comprising large limestone beams. Today these beams are damaged, which weakens the pyramid structure. Fragments of the sarcophagus were found here in the burial chamber, {{when it was first}} entered by John Shae Perring in the mid 19th century. The colossal roof blocks of Sahure's temple weighed up to about 220 tons based on estimates by Perring. He estimated the size of the largest blocks at 35 feet by 9 feet by 12 feet. One end of these blocks was tapered so the estimated volume is 95 cubic meters or 2.4 tons. The mortuary complex immediately around the pyramid also comprises a second pyramid built for the Ka of the king.|$|E

50|$|Cooee and its unnamed {{neighbour}} originally {{formed a}} pair of semi-detached, single-storeyed brick cottages with separate, steeply pitched <b>gabled</b> <b>roofs</b> containing attic spaces lit by dormer windows. The galvanised iron roofs {{are likely to have}} been shingled originally.|$|R
50|$|Other {{structures}} in the complex include a <b>gabled</b> <b>roofed</b> generator shed behind the Head Keeper's cottage, a painted brick workshop room behind the shed, a paint store {{to the north of}} the Assistant Keepers' cottages, and a garage.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} New Paltz station {{burned down}} around 4:45 A.M. on April23, 1907, damaging freight and killing station agent E. J. Snyder's dog. The fire {{originated in the}} office stove, and spread rapidly before local fire companies could arrive. A passenger car {{was used as a}} temporary station while the building was rebuilt. By late September 1907, the concrete foundation and the framework of the new building had been put in place, but work on the interior did not begin until November because the lumber had not arrived. The depot was completely rebuilt by December31, 1907, and in active use by February7, 1908. While the original station had a <b>gabled</b> <b>roof,</b> the rebuilt station was hipped. The direction of the new station's battens was horizontal; the original station had had vertical slats. The rebuilt freight house was placed a distance from the depot.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of Madagascar {{is unique in}} Africa, bearing strong resemblance to the {{architecture of}} southern Borneo from which the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar {{are believed to have}} emigrated. Traditional construction in this part of Borneo, also known as South Kalimantan, is distinguished by rectangular houses raised on piles. The roof, which is supported by a central pillar, is steeply sloped; the gable beams cross to form roof horns that may be decoratively carved. The central Highlands of Madagascar are populated by the Merina, peoples who bear strong physiological and cultural resemblance to their Kalimantan ancestors; here, the traditional wooden houses of the aristocracy feature a central pillar (andry) supporting a steeply sloped roof decorated with roof horns (tandro-trano). In the southeast of Madagascar, actual zebu horns were traditionally affixed to the gable peak. Throughout Madagascar, houses are rectangular with a <b>gabled</b> <b>roof</b> as in Kalimantan, central pillars are widespread, and in all but a handful of regions, traditional homes are built on piles in a manner handed down from generation to generation, regardless of whether the feature is suited to local conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} a timber frame house that was {{originally}} constructed {{on the west side}} of Pine Street, but its original form is not known for sure due the extent of its expansion and remodeling. The NRHP nomination states that it could have been a -story <b>gabled</b> <b>roof</b> cottage with a cross-gable in the center, a style popular during the mid-century in Pawtucket. This original structure retains little of its form except for the Gothic hood moulds on the second floor end windows and the Gothic bargeboards. A two-story hipped roof addition was constructed in two phases, one completed before 1877 and the other between 1895 and 1902. Though the NRHP also states that the original house was enlarged in the late 1860s or 1870s without specification to the work done at the time. The additions include a bay window on the facade and openwork on the porch sides. The later alterations to the building worked to compliment the distinctive bargeboards of the cottage with the work on the eaves and window heads of the addition.|$|E
25|$|The four frame {{structures}} {{from the}} original 1921 Van Platen - Fox Lumber Camp are similar singe-story buildings with <b>gabled</b> <b>roofs</b> and vertical pine plank siding. Three of the buildings are unaltered, but the camp office/store has two small, single-story additions.|$|R
25|$|The Ernest Baynes Stand is a {{substantial}} brick structure located to the southwest of the Main Arena, adjacent to the Council Stand. It features face brickwork with decorative rendered panels along the parapet and in a broad band across {{the middle of the}} facade. At street level, offices open directly off the street. There is a later cantilevered awning with mock <b>gabled</b> <b>roofs</b> over the western end of this level. The eastern end is obscured by a set of concrete fire escape stairs with offices beneath. Cantilevered off the rear wall parapet are two small landings with later <b>gabled</b> <b>roofs,</b> which formerly serviced two rear staircases between the upper and lower seating tiers.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, Tudor Revival homes {{draw from}} the medieval {{architecture}} of Europe. These dwellings feature steeply pitched <b>gabled</b> <b>roofs,</b> and are often ornamented with half timbering. They also are identifiable by their picturesque massing, multiple pane window groupings and massive brick chimneys.|$|R
5|$|The New Parishes Act 1844 {{allowed for}} the {{creation}} of a parish for Chadderton, dedicated to St Matthew the Evangelist. Services were initially held in the stables of Chadderton Hall, and then in a temporary wooden structure opened in 1848. The Church of St Matthew was opened for the parish in 1857 by the then Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee. A steeple was added in 1881. Following the construction of this church, four followed. There are now several Anglican parishes, and within them daughter and mission churches, serving the town. The parish of St Matthew united with the neighbouring parish of St Luke, and the United Benefice of St Matthew with St Luke now lies within the Oldham West Deanery of the Diocese of Manchester. The parish of Christ Church, founded in 1870, which also contains the church of St Saviour's and Crossley Christian Centre, is one of the largest numerically in the township and lies on the border with Werneth. The parish of Emmanuel, now meeting in the St George's building on Broadway, was originally part of Christ Church parish. Also within this deanery is the Parish Church of St Mark, built in the early1960s. It is a blue brick building with a graduated slate pitched roof, and a rectangular brick steeple with a high <b>gabled</b> <b>roof.</b> It was granted Grade II listed building status in 1998.|$|E
25|$|A similar design {{incorporating}} a <b>gabled</b> <b>roof</b> {{has also been}} suggested.|$|E
25|$|The pre-1934 Storage {{building}} is a rectangular, one story structure on a concrete foundation. It has a <b>gabled</b> <b>roof</b> and wood siding, when the district was nominated in 1994 the storage building's <b>gabled</b> <b>roof</b> had asbestos shingles. The interior of the {{building is}} open, its walls and ceilings are plywood {{and it has a}} concrete floor.|$|E
50|$|Lemko churches {{most often}} used a three-section design with very tall <b>gabled</b> <b>roofs</b> and a tower over each section, with the tower over the {{entrance}} being the tallest. Topping each tower is a spire, resembling a Gothic spire, albeit constructed in Ukrainian style.|$|R
50|$|Constructed in 1909, the 2-1/2 story {{house was}} {{designed}} by the distinguished local architect Alexander C. Eschweiler. It has exterior walls of mauve-brown Ohio brick trimmed with Lake Superior sandstone of a similar but lighter hue. Steeply pitched intersecting <b>gabled</b> <b>roofs</b> top the house.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} was realised in a Gothic Revival style. It was built of Kentish ragstone, with ashlar stone dressings and has steeply pitched <b>gabled</b> <b>roofs,</b> {{of more than}} forty roof slopes. The roof is slate, in varying coloured bands of pale and dark grey tiles.|$|R
