5|$|Stivetts {{was again}} {{reserved}} by Boston, and later re-signed for $2000. Due to the Beaneaters' solid, four-man starting pitching rotation of Nichols, Klobedanz, Lewis, and rookie Vic Willis, his role {{with the team}} {{was expected to be}} as an extra outfielder. Stivetts claimed that he had never felt better in <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> outlook on the up-coming season was positive.|$|E
5|$|Alkan's {{attachment}} to his Jewish origins is displayed both in <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> work. He {{was the first}} composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, {{like many of his}} musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works.|$|E

5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E
5|$|In {{later life}} Lilly {{obtained}} a large atlas and marked {{the path of}} his movements in {{the war and the}} location of battles and skirmishes. He often used the atlas when telling war stories. His colonel's title stayed with him for the rest of <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> friends and family used it as a nickname for him. Lilly served as chairman of the Grand Army of the Republic, a brotherhood of Union Civil War veterans, in 1893. During his term he helped organize an event that brought tens of thousands of Union war veterans, including Lilly's battery, together in Indianapolis for a reunion and a large parade.|$|E

25|$|Liao's parents {{divorced}} early in <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> {{father was in}} and out of jail. Raised by his grandparents, he dropped out of junior high school and blamed the education system for his actions, although a school official cited numerous instances where they attempted to contact his grandparents and uncle. Liao ran errands for Weng, who reputedly had a bad temper and a stingy nature, prompting him to leave Weng's service for Yang's employ.|$|E
25|$|The {{work was}} fatiguing, and {{during these years}} he {{suffered}} from an increasingly fragile constitution. In addition {{to his home in}} Paris, from 1844 he also lived at a small cottage in Champrosay, where he found respite in the countryside. From 1834 until his death, he was faithfully cared for by his housekeeper, Jeanne-Marie le Guillou, who zealously guarded his privacy, and whose devotion prolonged <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> ability to continue working in his later years.|$|E
25|$|Rand's {{explanation}} of values presents {{the view that}} an individual's primary moral obligation is to achieve his own well-being—it is for <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> self-interest that an individual ought to adhere to a moral code. Ethical egoism is a corollary of setting man's life as the moral standard. Rand believed that rational egoism is the logical consequence of humans following evidence wherever it leads them. The only alternative would be that they live without orientation to reality.|$|E

25|$|After {{reconciliation}} with son, Milan returned to Serbia in 1897, {{to be appointed}} as commander-in-chief of the Serbian army. In this capacity he {{did some of the}} best work of <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> success in improving the Serbian military system was very marked. His relations with the young king also remained good for a time. The Serbian pro-Democratic opposition was blamed him for the increasingly authoritarian rule of the young King, and a member of Radical Party, attempted to kill him on 6 July 1899, (24 June OS), on the Orthodox holiday of Ivanjdan (Birth of St. John the Baptist).|$|E
25|$|The {{poet and}} {{journalist}} Louis Latourette, upon visiting the artist's previously well-appointed studio after his transformation, discovered {{the place in}} upheaval, the Renaissance reproductions discarded from the walls, the plush drapes in disarray. Modigliani was already an alcoholic and a drug addict by this time, and his studio reflected this. Modigliani's behaviour at this time sheds some light upon his developing style as an artist, in that the studio had become almost a sacrificial effigy for all that he resented about the academic art that had marked <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> training up to that point.|$|E
25|$|Valentino's {{hometown}} of Castellaneta, Italy, has created several services in his honor. The Museo Rodolfo Valentino was opened {{in his childhood}} home and a statue was unveiled in 1961.

In 2009, a film school was also opened in his hometown, Centro Studi Cine Club Rodolfo Valentino Castellaneta. At the 1995 centennial of his birth, several events were held in his honor. From 1972 to 2006, an Italian acting award—The Rudolph Valentino Award—was handed out every year. Several actors {{from all over the}} world received this award, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Elizabeth Taylor.|$|E
