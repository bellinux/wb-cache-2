5|$|<b>Involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> {{involves}} the causing {{of the death}} of another person without intent to kill or intention to commit grievous bodily harm. Some cases are in form similar to murder cases; whilst, in others, had death not been caused, the defendant would only be liable for an insignificant crime.|$|E
5|$|Mehserle's {{trial was}} {{subsequently}} moved to Los Angeles following concerns {{that he would}} be unable to get a fair trial in Alameda County. On July 8, 2010, Mehserle was found guilty on a lesser charge of <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter.</b> He was released on June 13, 2011 and is now on parole.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main forms of {{manslaughter}} in English law: voluntary manslaughter, cases which would otherwise amount to murder {{but for some}} legally recognised mitigating factor; and <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> which includes cases of gross negligence manslaughter and unlawful act manslaughter.|$|E
50|$|The jury deliberated for 41 {{hours over}} a period of six days, acquitting Nichols on December 24, 1997, of {{actually}} detonating the bomb, but convicting him of conspiring with McVeigh to use a weapon of mass destruction, a capital offense. They acquitted Nichols on the charges of first degree (premeditated) murder, but convicted him on the lesser charge of <b>involuntary</b> (unintentional) <b>manslaughter</b> in the deaths of the federal law enforcement officers.|$|R
50|$|On 11 September 2013 {{the court}} in Coutances found the Vitesse captain Paul Le Romancer and first officer Yves Tournon (both of whom no longer work for Condor) guilty of <b>manslaughter,</b> <b>involuntary</b> injury and failure to respect {{maritime}} regulations. Tournon was later exonerated by the Caen appeal court, which quashed his conviction.|$|R
5000|$|During [...] "Farewell, My Lovely", Spencer {{notices a}} message from Drake in a wine bottle while she was with the other Liars. Following its instructions, Spencer headed to the Lost Woods where she found Mary {{awaiting}} her. Preparing to leave town, Drake divulges to her daughter that she put the resort's deed in her name and Alison’s so they could use it for money in case they needed legal assistance. Mary further states that preventing Lieutenant Tanner from obtaining arrest warrants for her family was the least she could do. Later that day, Mona confesses to having murdered Charlotte after realizing that her mental health hadn't improved and her true intentions were to torture the Liars again. This revelation led to the final {{pieces of the puzzle}} being left for the Liars to find on Hanna’s car. They placed the pieces into the board game, which A.D. had moved to the DiLaurentis residence. The phone from the game bid the Liars congratulations and through augmented reality informed them the grand prize was to discover Archer’s corpse buried at Carol Ward's house. The girls rushed over there with shovels to dig the body up but Aria persuades her friends to stop playing the game and walk away. As they did, Tanner and the authorities turned up and the girls were all taken into custody. Fearing that they were about to be charged with first degree murder, the Liars are shocked to observe Drake in the interrogation room confessing to the murders of Dunhill and Jessica. While the Liars (minus Alison) knew she was accountable for her sister's homicide, they were shocked to witness Mary take the fall for Archer's <b>involuntary</b> vehicular <b>manslaughter.</b> Tanner allows the girls to walk away free but made it clear that she knew Drake wasn't accountable for Dunhill's death. Spencer tearfully watches Mary get taken away and whilst the two briefly make eye contact, Drake puts her finger to her lips, instructing Spencer not to stop her from sparing them a prison sentence.|$|R
5|$|When Dan White {{was found}} guilty of <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter,</b> his {{successful}} diminished capacity defense enraged the gay community. That the police and fire departments had raised money for his defense gave their anger a focus, turning it against the city government and especially the SFPD.|$|E
5|$|While {{preparing}} {{for a series of}} comeback concerts scheduled to begin in July 2009, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication after suffering cardiac arrest on June 25, 2009. His personal physician was convicted of <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> in his death and sentenced to four years in prison.|$|E
5|$|Although McCarthy {{had been}} charged with first-degree murder, the judge allowed the jury to {{consider}} lesser charges of second-degree murder and <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter.</b> On June 26, 2017, the jury returned a verdict of second-degree murder and two days later he was sentenced to life imprisonment; he will be eligible for parole in 2037.|$|E
5000|$|During [...] "Farewell, My Lovely", Caleb divulges to the Liars that Mona has {{the board}} game and they {{jump to the}} {{conclusion}} that she is Uber A. Spencer notices a message from Drake in a wine bottle while she was with the other Liars. Following its instructions, Spencer headed to the Lost Woods where she found Mary awaiting her. Preparing to leave town, Drake divulges to her daughter that she put the resort's deed in her name and Alison’s so they could use it for money in case they needed legal assistance. Mary further states that preventing Lieutenant Tanner from obtaining arrest warrants for her family was the least she could do. Later that day, Hanna notices rose petals falling from the church's bell tower which prompts her to investigate. There she finds Mona dressed like she used to in high school. Hanna is puzzled over the fact that her friend keeps referring to her as Charlotte. Mona divulges she killed Charlotte and through flashbacks we see the two of them engaging in a heated confrontation. After realizing that her health condition hadn't improved after all and her intentions were to torture the Liars again through even worse approaches, Mona held a screwdriver to Charlotte's back. She taunted her former tormentor to jump or else she'd push her. Shortly after narrating a portion of the events, Mona suddenly grabs Hanna and attempts to throw her off the bell tower until Caleb and Spencer arrive just in time to prevent any collateral damage from happening. Mona is then taken to the Lost Woods and discloses to Spencer she messed up killing Charlotte. Asking what she meant by that, Spencer coaxed the full story from Vanderwaal who revealed that a fight broke out. Charlotte cruelly assures Mona the Liars will never love her back, causing Vanderwaal to gain the upper hand and shove her against a wall. A metal rod impales and snaps her spine, killing Charlotte instantly. Vanderwaal then threw her lifeless body from the bell tower and placed a rose on her hand. This revelation led to the final pieces of the puzzle being left for the Liars to find on Hanna’s car. They placed the pieces into the board game, which A.D. had moved to the DiLaurentis residence. The phone from the game bid the Liars congratulations and through augmented reality informed them the grand prize was to discover Archer’s corpse buried at Carol Ward's house.

In the episode's closing sequence, Alex is seen driving off into the sunrise with the Liars' game pieces in a plastic bag.|$|R
5|$|The total {{compensation}} demanded by {{families of the}} victims came to 830,000 euros. Victims' families were also reported to want the police inspector who did not confiscate Saari's gun {{in the days before the}} shooting (Saari was interviewed in relation to his internet videos), who was charged with dereliction of duty, to be additionally charged with <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Jackson had been {{administered}} propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam, and the Los Angeles coroner decided to treat the death as a homicide. Law enforcement officials conducted a manslaughter investigation of his personal physician Conrad Murray, and charged him with <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> in Los Angeles on February 8, 2010. Jackson's body was entombed on September 3, 2009, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.|$|E
5|$|Nichols stood trial twice. He {{was first}} tried {{by the federal}} {{government}} in 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to build {{a weapon of mass destruction}} and of eight counts of <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> of federal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998 to life without parole, the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death-penalty conviction on 161counts of first-degree murder (160non-federal agent victims and onefetus). On May 26, 2004 the jury found him guilty on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylor then determined the sentence of 161consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. In March 2005, FBI investigators, acting on a tip, searched a buried crawl space in Nichols' former house and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested.|$|E
5|$|Paisley {{retired in}} 1983 and was {{replaced}} by his assistant, Joe Fagan. Liverpool won the League, League Cup and European Cup in Fagan's first season, becoming the first English side to win three trophies in a season. Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985, against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium. Before kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence which separated the two groups of supporters, and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster. The match was played in spite of protests by both managers, and Liverpool lost 1–0 to Juventus. As a result of the tragedy, English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years; Liverpool received a ten-year ban, which was later reduced to six years. Fourteen Liverpool fans received convictions for <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aspects of Jackson's {{personal}} life, {{including his}} changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. In 1993, {{he was accused}} of child sexual abuse, but the civil case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his comeback concert series, This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician, Conrad Murray, was convicted of <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter.</b> Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief, and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world. Forbes ranks Jackson the top-earning dead celebrity, with earnings of $825 million in 2016, the highest yearly amount ever recorded by the publication. Jackson is also remembered for his generous philanthropy and his pioneering efforts in charitable fundraising within the entertainment industry. In October 2017, Forbes announced that Jackson had topped the publication's list of top-earning dead celebrities for the fifth straight year with annual earnings of $75 million.|$|E
25|$|The {{shooting}} {{has been}} variously classified as an <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> since the officer later claimed {{he thought he}} was using his taser gun. On January 30, 2010, Alameda County prosecutors charged Mehserle with murder for the shooting. He resigned his position, and pleaded not guilty. The trial began on June 10, 2010. On July 8, 2010, Mehserle was found guilty of <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> and not guilty of second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter.|$|E
25|$|Judge Perry offered jurors three {{conviction}} options: {{second-degree murder}} (with {{a sentence of}} 15 years to life in prison), voluntary manslaughter (3 to 11 years), or <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> (2 to 4 years); in addition the jury could have decided to acquit. Prosecutor Michael O'Brien said that by shooting Grant, Mehserle inherently committed a crime. Intention meant murder or voluntary manslaughter, and an accident indicated recklessness on Mehserle's part and thus <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter.</b> Judge Perry gave two interpretations of Mehserle's shocked reaction after shooting Grant: either Mehserle had intended to use his Taser or he realized that many people were witnesses to his action.|$|E
25|$|On August 5, 2011, Winfield, {{charged with}} premeditated murder and {{conspiracy}} to commit murder, pleaded guilty under a plea deal to <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> and use of an illegal controlled substance. The <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> charge stems from Winfield's failure to intervene and prevent the other soldiers from carrying out the attack against the Afghan in U.S. custody. Under the plea deal he didn't admit to the killing of Mullah Adahdad. He claimed that he fired his automatic weapon away from Adahdad but that he did nothing to stop the murder. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison. He {{was released from prison}} in August 2012.|$|E
25|$|All the {{defendants}} belonged to C Company, 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division.

Three employees of the park were charged with <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter.</b>|$|E
25|$|Snuka {{was indicted}} and arrested in September 2015 on third-degree murder and <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> charges, in {{relation}} to the May 1983 death of his girlfriend, Nancy Argentino. Snuka pleaded not guilty, but was ultimately found unfit to stand trial in June 2016 due to being diagnosed with dementia. As his health declined, the charges were dismissed on January 3, 2017. He died twelve days later.|$|E
25|$|On June 16, 2017, Judge Lawrence Moniz of the Bristol County Juvenile Court of Massachusetts, in Taunton found Carter legally {{guilty of}} <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter.</b> He stated {{prior to his}} ruling that it was Carter's phone calls with Roy {{when he was in}} his truck gassing himself (as {{described}} by Carter's texts to friends), rather than the preceding text messages, that caused him to go through with killing himself.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a series}} of Article 32 {{hearings}} on March 5, 2012, investigators dropped the most serious charge, <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter,</b> which carries a maximum penalty of ten years in prison, against the defendants. However, four of the eight soldiers were then recommended for court-martial on the remaining charges such as negligent homicide, which carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison. Subsequent trials were held at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.|$|E
25|$|On May 1, the six {{officers}} were charged in Gray's death.

One of the officers trials ended in mistrial. Three of the {{officers were}} found not guilty at trial and the remaining charges against the officers were dropped on July 27, 2016.|$|E
25|$|Several {{people have}} been convicted of <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> in cases {{involving}} insufficient and slow medical help to athletes who experienced commotio cordis during sports events, as well as in cases of intentional delivery of contusive blows. In 1992, Italian hockey player Miran Schrott died after a blow to his chest from the stick of Canadian-Italian player Jimmy Boni. Boni was charged with culpable homicide, and eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter, paying a $1,300 fine and $175,000 restitution to Schrott's family.|$|E
25|$|Today Casale, in {{the middle}} of the {{industrial}} triangle Turin-Milan-Genoa, is an important industrial center, known for the production of cement and the closed factory Eternit, that produced the homonymous material, very dangerous due to the presence of asbestos. Thousands of inhabitants of Casale have died from mesothelioma, a fatal disease caused by the breathing of asbestos. In 2012, former executives and Eternit shareholders Stephan Schmidheiny and Louis de Cartier were ordered to pay $32.5 million to the town of Casale Monferrato after being convicted of <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> for exposing workers and townspeople to asbestos.|$|E
25|$|On July 7, {{charges of}} <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> were filed against five {{officials}} and employees of Ringling Bros. Within days {{of these charges}} being filed, the circus reached an agreement with Hartford officials to accept full financial responsibility and pay whatever amount the city requested in damages. This resulted in the circus paying out almost US$5,000,000 to the 600 victims and families who had filed claims against them by 1954. All circus profits {{from the time of}} the fire until then had been set aside to pay off these claims.|$|E
25|$|On April 26, 2006, Taylor {{received}} {{national attention}} when a University van {{was involved in}} a fatal accident outside Marion, Indiana, while traveling between the Fort Wayne and Upland campuses. The accident happened when a northbound semi-trailer truck driver fell asleep at the wheel, crossed the median and struck the southbound passenger van on I-69. Four students and one staff member were killed, and three staff members and one student were injured. The accident occurred two days before former University president Eugene Habecker's inauguration ceremony. The truck driver was convicted of reckless, <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> and received a four-year prison sentence.|$|E
25|$|On September 1, 2015, 32 {{years after}} the incident, Snuka {{was arrested and charged}} with third-degree murder and <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> for Argentino's death. It is the oldest case to result in charges in Lehigh County's history. On October 7, Snuka's lawyers agreed to forego a {{preliminary}} hearing, which the prosecution contended was a waste of court resources, given the thorough grand jury investigation. In return, they received transcripts and other evidence from that investigation, which defense attorney Robert J. Kirwan II said would be much more helpful in preparing Snuka's case than a hearing would have been.|$|E
25|$|Santana {{was signed}} by CBS Records {{and went into the}} studio to record their first album in January 1969. They were not {{satisfied}} with the subsequent release (which consisted of tracks recorded in May 1969) and decided changes needed to be made. This resulted in the dismissal of drummer Bob Livingston. Santana replaced him with Mike Shrieve, who had a strong background in both jazz and rock. Percussionist Marcus Malone was forced to quit the band due to <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> charges, and the band re-enlisted Michael Carabello. Carabello brought with him percussionist Jose Chepito Areas, who was already well known in his native Nicaragua, and, with his skills and professional experience, was a major contributor to the band.|$|E
25|$|Murder {{will make}} the killer a {{constructive}} trustee of whatever property they acquire as a result. This applies to murder, as in In the Estate of Crippen, inciting someone to murder, as in Evans v Evans, and causing death by reckless driving, as in R v Seymour (Edward). In Re K, {{it was confirmed that}} <b>involuntary</b> <b>manslaughter</b> will not require constructive trusts, and neither will situations where there is a successful plea of insanity, as in found in Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964. Curiously, there is no requirement that the defendant be found guilty in criminal proceedings; in Re Sigsworth, it was decided that claims can be brought without criminal proceedings having taken place providing the defendant is held up to the criminal standards of guilt in the equity case.|$|E
