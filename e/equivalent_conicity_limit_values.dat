40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that railway dynamics {{is far from being}} trivial, mostly because of the wheel/rail contact phenomenon. Except for specialists in this field who are obviously familiar with notions like wheelset <b>equivalent</b> <b>conicity,</b> hunting motion, <b>limit</b> cycles, etc., most of people, including engineers, have no or few idea about the guidance principle of railway vehicles equipped with standard bogies with rigid wheelsets. The present project has been initiated at the Center for Research in Mechatronics of the Université catholique de Louvain within the framework of a master thesis under our supervision. The main objective is essentially educational and led us to build an experimental bench to highlight the wheel/rail guidance phenomenon of railway vehicles...|$|R

Among the four types of wheel profiles, the type XP 55 wheel had the smallest cumulative wear depth, and LM had the largest wear.

40|$|Railway {{vehicles}} {{are among the}} most complex dynamical systems in engineering due to the large number of degrees of freedom and the non-linear interaction between wheel and rail. The purpose of this research is to analyse the dynamic stability of a railway vehicle travelling on a tangent track at constant speed. As instability index, the establishment of a self-sustained limit cycle is considered. In reality, a limit cycle is almost always present. What separates stability from instability is the amplitude of such cycle. In fact, cycles characterised by small amplitudes can't endanger the vehicle's behaviour. This paper discusses both numerical integration methods of the non-linear equations of motion of the railway vehicle and the linear methods based on the <b>equivalent</b> <b>conicity</b> concept to assess the vehicle's critical velocity limit...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{interaction}} between a railway freight vehicle and a track switch is studied by simulations of vehicle dynamics. In particular, {{the influence of}} a stochastic spread (scatter) in traffic parameters on damage in the switch is assessed. The considered parameters are wheel profile and wheel–rail friction coefficient. To form a database for sampling, 120 wheel profiles from freight wagons in traffic have been measured and categorised with respect to wear. Among the investigated parameters, it is shown that <b>equivalent</b> <b>conicity</b> is the wheel profile parameter correlating best to damage in the switch and crossing panels. The influence of hollow worn wheels on damage is also investigated and it is found that such wheel profiles display a different running behaviour at the crossing transition. Convergence properties for samples of runs generated by Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) are compared to the corresponding properties obtained by pure random sampling. It is concluded that the LHS generated samples exhibit a smaller variance...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} reduce the wheel profile wear of {{high-speed}} trains and extend the service life of wheels, a dynamic model for a high-speed vehicle was set up, in which the wheelset was regarded as flexible body, and the actual measured track irregularities and line conditions were considered. The wear depth of the wheel profile was calculated by the well-known Archard wear law. Through this model, the influence of the wheel profile, primary suspension stiffness, track gage, and rail cant on the wear of wheel profile were studied through multiple iterative calculations. Numerical simulation results show that the type XP 55 wheel profile has the smallest cumulative wear depth, and the type LM wheel profile has the largest wear depth. To reduce the wear of the wheel profile, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>conicity</b> of the wheel should not be too large or too small. On the other hand, a small primary vertical stiffness, a track gage around 1, 435 – 1, 438 mm, and a rail cant around 1 : 35 – 1 : 40 are beneficial for dynamic performance improvement and wheel wear alleviation.|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{evaluation}} of the <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> which are stated in CUR 236 – Micropiles is presented. This evaluation has been done by means of a dataset. The dataset contained information on failure tests performed on four different types of micropiles, and was initially used for research on relations between logged installation aspects and the final capacity of the piles; such relations were however not found. This was mainly caused by the shape in which the data was logged, and the lack of details in the data. During this research, significant differences between raw data and data adapted according the <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> stated in CUR 236, were found. This led to a change in research direction towards the evaluation of the <b>limit</b> <b>values.</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>values</b> are values that are used to build in additional safety in a design, and thus, to prevent unsafe situations. The values are based on the shape of data in which in general a linear relation between maximum mobilized shear stresses (τ_(mob;max)) and cone resistance (q_c). This relation continues up to a certain cone resistance level, after which τ_(mob;max) does not increase significantly anymore. The point where no significant increase in τ_(mob;max) over q_c was seen, was used as the <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> for the cone resistance. The limit for α_t was chosen to be 2. 5 % and the limit for τ_(mob;max) 2. 5 % of the cone resistance <b>limit.</b> Data with <b>values</b> above these <b>limits,</b> has to be reduced to the <b>limit</b> <b>values.</b> (CUR 236, 2011) Differences were thus found between raw data, the same data but then adapted according the <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> method stated in CUR 236, and values stated in CUR 236 Table 6. 1. For further investigation on how these differences were caused, the available dataset was combined with data from the appendix ‘Bijlage A. Proefbelastingen’ of CUR 236. This showed that the current <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> did not suit the shape of the data very well. Investigation on the usefulness of the <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> showed that they are useful for the design process by preventing under- and overestimations of the capacity. <b>Limit</b> <b>values</b> are thus useful, but not in their current form. New <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> were therefore proposed based on a statistical analysis of the available data points. Next to <b>limit</b> <b>values,</b> also design values (expectancy and lower bound) are added. Because no detailed data for all micropile types was available, it is advised to re-elaborate the limit- and design values for the types that were left out of the proposal given in this thesis, in a similar, statistical way. Furthermore is it advised to investigate a different method to estimate the shear stresses that can be mobilized along the anchor body of a micropile, based on a more fundamental approach. Currently are those stresses often based on full-scale tests from which τ_(mob;max) is derived, but bounded by the <b>limit</b> <b>values.</b> A different approach to this might be more time- and cost-effective.

40|$|This work {{describes}} an analytical approach {{to determine what}} degree of accuracy is required {{in the definition of}} the rail vehicle models used for dynamic simulations. This way {{it would be possible to}} know in advance how the results of simulations may be altered due to the existence of errors in the creation of rolling stock models, whilst also identifying their critical parameters. This would make it possible to maximize the time available to enhance dynamic analysis and focus efforts on factors that are strictly necessary. In particular, the parameters related both to the track quality and to the rolling contact were considered in this study. With this aim, a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess their influence on the vehicle dynamic behaviour. To do this, 72 dynamic simulations were performed modifying, one at a time, the track quality, the wheel-rail friction coefficient and the <b>equivalent</b> <b>conicity</b> of both new and worn wheels. Three values were assigned to each parameter, and two wear states were considered for each type of wheel, one for new wheels and another one for reprofiled wheels. After processing the results of these simulations, it was concluded that all the parameters considered show very high influence, though the friction coefficient shows the highest influence. Therefore, it is recommended to undertake any future simulation job with measured track geometry and track irregularities, measured wheel profiles and normative values of wheel-rail friction coefficient...|$|R
