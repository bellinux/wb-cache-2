40|$|International audienceMeasurement of skin {{absorption}} of ions requires specific experimental protocols {{regarding the use of}} pig skin as a model, the viability of <b>excised</b> <b>skin</b> in water medium over 24 h, the presence of endogenous ions, and evaluation of the contributions of facilitated transport through ion channels and ion transporters. Absorption experiments of halide anions F-, Cl-, Br- and I- in <b>excised</b> <b>skin</b> were performed in Franz diffusion cells. Experiments were performed on human and porcine skin under various conditions so as to define and validate experimental protocols. The distributions of endogenous ions and the absorption kinetics of halide ions were similar in both porcine and human skin models. Fresh skin kept its viability over 24 h in salt-free water, allowing experiments following OECD guidelines. Permeation increased in the order F- < Cl- < Br- < I- for all receptor media and skin samples. Absorption was larger in fresh skin due to the transport through chloride channels or exchangers. Skin absorption experiments of ions in Franz cells rely on working with fresh <b>excised</b> <b>skin</b> (human or porcine) and pure water as receptor fluid. Experiments with chloride blockers or frozen/thawed skin allow discriminating passive diffusion and facilitated transport...|$|E

Also a method is presented for observing changes in optical density (OD) of a sheet of stratum corneum subsequent to the application of an UVRAC and then washing it from the surface. Using these methods, p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and 2 -ethylhexyl p-dimethyl aminobenzoate (O-PABA) have been studied. In {{the presence or absence}} of the nonvolatile vehicle, isopropyl myristate (IM), significant amounts of PABA enter the skin but almost all of the O- PABA remains on the surface. Nevertheless subsequently PABA is more easily removed by water than is O-PABA.

40|$|A {{shortage}} of available experimental data {{exists in the}} available bibliography on the release rate of calcium dobesilate (CD) from hydrogel formulations. Thus, {{the aim of the}} study was to evaluate the effect of selected hydrophilic nonionic polymers and anionic polymers on the release rate of CD from formulation provided for dermal application, as compared to the reference product in the market. The work utilized <b>excised</b> pork <b>skin,</b> while, Methylcellulose (MC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and anionic polymers (copolymers of acrylic acid) were used as CD carriers. The release study was executed by the pharmacopoeial paddle method, with extraction cells and fresh <b>excised</b> porcine <b>skin</b> as a membrane. CD in aqueous acceptor fluid was quantified by UV-VIS spectrometry at 300 nm. Subsequently, the kinetic curves were fitted to a zero-order kinetics model, a first-order kinetics model, a second-order kinetics model, as well as to the Higuchi model. The work saw that porcine ear skin influences the release pattern of the CD, compared to the artificial membrane. In the study, the evaluated formulations with MC, polyacrylic acid (PA) and polyacrylate crosspolymer 11 (PC- 11) deliver over 60 % of the active component (AC), within 250 min, through the <b>excised</b> porcine ear <b>skin,</b> to the acceptor compartment. Moreover, the release observed via porcine ear skin to the aqueous acceptor compartment is congenial to zero-order or first-order kinetics.

30|$|The {{slope of}} the {{testosterone}} absorption curve is less steep indicating that the skin of X. laevis represents a greater barrier to the uptake of testosterone compared to caffeine. Nevertheless, the steepest slope was reached within the first hour of exposure (Fig.  1).

Percentages of testosterone after 8  h found in the receptor fluids were slightly less than mean percentages of caffeine absorbed after 4  h, ranging between 66.5  ±  6.3 and 84.8  ±  5.7  % (Table  1). Non-absorbed doses of testosterone washed off the skin surface after 8  h ranged from 9.6  ±  1.8 to 21.5  ±  4.1  %. With regard to the content of testosterone within the skin, trends were similar to those of caffeine: the highest percentage of testosterone was contained within freshly <b>excised</b> dorsal <b>skin</b> accounting for 16.5  ±  1.9  % of the applied dose. The maximum absorption rates, ranging from 5.3  ±  0.5 to 12.0  ±  5.6  µg/(cm 2  h), and maximum permeability coefficients, ranging from 1.3  ±  0.1 to 3.0  ±  1.4  ×  10 − 3  cm/h, again demonstrated that the skin of X. laevis seemed to be a greater barrier for testosterone than caffeine uptake.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Mohs {{micrographic}} {{surgery is}} a technique used to <b>excise</b> <b>skin</b> tumors based on comprehensive surgical mapping, in which the surgeon removes the tumor, followed by a complete histological evaluation of the tumor's margins. The correlation {{of the presence of}} a tumor in histological examinations and its precise location on the surgical map result in a complete removal of the tumor with maximum normal tissue preservation. The present article seeks to provide general practitioners and healthcare specialists with guidelines regarding recommendations for Mohs micrographic surgery to treat skin tumors, based on the most reliable evidence available in medical literature on the subject. This bibliographic review of scientific articles in this line of research was conducted based on data collected from MEDLINE/PubMed. The search strategy used in this study was based on structured questions in the Patient, Intervention, Control, and Outcome (PICO) format. MeSH terms were used as descriptors. The indications of this technique are related to recurrence, histology, size, definition of tumor margins, and location of tumors.

30|$|The dermal {{absorption}} in vitro method (OECD guideline 428), an established toxicological (mammal) test procedure, was adapted to amphibian skin, {{in a first}} approach using the laboratory model organism Xenopus laevis and reference compounds (caffeine and testosterone). Skin permeability to both reference substances was significantly higher compared to published mammalian data. Caffeine permeated faster across the skin than testosterone, with ventral skin tending to be more permeable than dorsal skin. As usage of frozen mammalian skin is accepted, frozen skin of X. laevis was tested in parallel. To the freshly <b>excised</b> <b>skin,</b> however, freezing led to increased skin permeability, in particular to caffeine, indicating a loss of skin integrity due to freezing (without additional preservation measures).|$|E
30|$|In {{line with}} the {{observed}} permeability differences, impedances of frozen skin samples were significantly {{lower than those of}} freshly <b>excised</b> <b>skin</b> samples indicating that freezing of the skin might affect impedance, possibly by affecting skin integrity. From this point of view, it might be suggested that impedance measurement is suitable for the assessment of skin integrity. In theory, epithelia such as amphibian skin are characterized by tight junctions, which separate apical from basolateral membranes. The tightness of adjacent cells sealed by these tight junctions determines the integrity of an epithelium [46]. By freezing, possible ice crystal formation followed by bursting of some epidermal cells might lead to impairment of this tight barrier, and consequently impedance decreases.|$|E
