5|$|A {{few months}} later, Mick and Tina go to Babe's house to confront her, as Stan's ashes have been {{replaced}} by custard powder, only to be greeted by a man who says that Babe has moved to Ramsgate. Along with Shirley, they track Babe down to a caravan in Ramsgate, where Babe states she was evicted from her house. Later, Shirley discovers a scrapbook of photos of young pregnant girls with <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> written on the back and realises that Babe and Queenie had kidnapped these girls and had their babies adopted out. Shirley is disgusted by Babe's actions and threatens to set her fire to her caravan, but Mick stops her. However, Babe burns the caravan down herself, realising that she needs to move on, and returns to Walford with Shirley, Mick and Tina. Linda's mother, Elaine Peacock (Maria Friedman), and her toyboy fiancé, Jason Adams (Scott Neal), temporarily move into the Vic. Babe does not trust Jason, although they have a passionate encounter, which is caught by Mick and Linda. Linda asks Babe to ensure Jason leaves Walford without informing Elaine of the reason, but when Elaine teases Babe, she reveals that she had sex with Jason. Elaine refuses to believe this, while Jason suggests that he and Babe steal from the pub and leave together. Babe secretly records the conversation and plays it to the Carters, who force Jason to leave. Babe admits to Elaine and Linda that she and Jason did not have sex and that she feels lonely. Babe continues to clash with Cora and is humiliated when Cora exposes her baby farming past to the Carter family and the pub's customers. Linda contemplates evicting Babe, but after Babe successfully leads a protest to house Cora, Linda allows Babe to stay.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} performance of <b>due</b> <b>date,</b> resource allocation, project release, and activity scheduling rules in a multiproject environment.

40|$|Abstract <b>Due</b> <b>date</b> {{assignment}} {{is an important}} task in shop floor control, affecting both timely delivery and customer sat-isfaction. <b>Due</b> <b>date</b> related performances are impacted {{by the quality of}} the <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment methods. Among the sim-ple and easy to implement <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment methods, the total work content (TWK) method achieves the best perform-ance for tardiness related performance criteria and is most widely used in practice and in study. The performance of the TWK method can be improved if the <b>due</b> <b>date</b> allowance factor k could render a more precise and accurate flowtime estimation of each individual job. In this study, in order to improve the performance of the TWK method, we have presented a model that incorporated a data mining tool – Decision Tree – for min-ing the knowledge of job scheduling about <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assign-ment in a dynamic job shop environment, which is represented by IF-THEN rules and is able to adjust an appropriate factor k according to the condition of the shop at the instant of job arrival, thereby reducing the <b>due</b> <b>date</b> prediction errors of the TWK method. Simulation results show that our proposed rule-based TWK <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment (RTWK) model is significantly better than its static and dynamic counterparts (i. e., TWK and Dynamic TWK methods). In addition, the RTWK model also extracted comprehensive scheduling knowledge about <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment, expressed in the form of IF-THEN rules, allowing production managers to easily understand the principles of <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{scheduling}} n jobs with a variable common <b>due</b> <b>date</b> {{on a single}} machine is studied. It is assumed that the job processing times are non-increasing linear functions of {{an equal amount of}} a resource allocated to the jobs. The <b>due</b> <b>date</b> and resource values can be continuous or discrete. The objective is to minimize a linear combination of scheduling, <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment and resource consumption costs. The resource consumption cost function may be non-monotonous. Algorithms with O(n 2 log n) running times are presented for scheduling costs involving earliness/tardiness and number of tardy jobs. Computational experiments show that the algorithms can solve problems with n = 5, 000 {{in less than a minute}} on a standard PC. We study a problem that combines scheduling, common <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment and resource allocation decisions. <b>Due</b> <b>date</b> scheduling is an important area of scheduling research because it focuses on customer satisfaction.

We show how this unified {{model can be}} useful in solving three different groups of scheduling problems. The first group includes four different <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment problems to minimize an objective function which includes costs for earliness, tardiness, <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment, makespan and total resource consumption. The second group includes three different <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment problems to minimize an objective function which includes the weighted number of tardy jobs, <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment costs, makespan and total resource consumption costs. The third group includes various scheduling problems which do not involve <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment decisions. We show that each of the problems from the first and the third groups can be reduced to a special case of our unified model and thus can be solved in O(n 3) time. Furthermore, we show how the unified model can be used repeatedly as a subroutine to solve all problems from the second group in O(n 4) time.
