5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{the city of}} Bellevue began {{studying}} a possible civic center with a new city hall, courthouses, a jail, a museum and a basketball arena for the Seattle SuperSonics. The civic center plan was scaled back to a single convention center in downtown Bellevue, Meydenbauer Center, and a new downtown library, both of which opened in 1993; the plan for a city hall was seen as controversial and unnecessary at the time. In 1990, the city hall area was proposed {{as the site of}} a county <b>jail</b> <b>and</b> courthouse to serve the Eastside. The proposed site, located north of city hall, was seen as undesirable because of its existing wetlands and was rejected in favor of a site near Overlake Hospital Medical Center.|$|E
