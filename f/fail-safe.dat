5|$|Octopus {{card reader}} {{includes}} a <b>fail-safe</b> that prevents reader from initiating transaction {{when more than}} one card is being detected at the same time. On 11 February 2009, Sing Tao Daily reported that the <b>fail-safe</b> has been abused for fare evasion through the railway station turnstile. A large amount of dishonest passengers at Sheung Shui Station and Lo Wu Station were stacking up 4 or more cards before breaking through the turnstile, pretending their cards have been touched with the reader correctly but triggering the <b>fail-safe</b> deliberately to avoid card value deduction. Because of this, if they get caught by the station staff, they can make an excuse of a hardware malfunction and offer the Octopus card with an unsuccessful transaction.|$|E
5|$|Another parodied film is the 1964 thriller <b>Fail-Safe</b> by Sidney Lumet: at the {{beginning}} of the third act of the episode, scenes of everyday life across Springfield are shown, and one by one, with a 'zooming' sound effect, they all freeze-frame in anticipation of the (supposedly) imminent nuclear blast; such was the ending of <b>Fail-Safe.</b> One of the scenes before the supposed nuclear blast shows Maggie picking flowers in a field, with the camera zooming into her eye, and then the minuscule blast occurs. This is a parody of the infamous and controversial Daisy ad used by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.|$|E
5|$|A {{working group}} {{produced}} a 34-page report with recommendations following the official inquiry, which {{was approved by}} the Jockey Club. Considerable public discussion had arisen over the possibility of introducing electronic devices, such as horns or flashing lights, to provide a <b>fail-safe</b> starting and recall system. The use of modern technology however was dismissed {{on the basis of a}} lack of total success overseas, and being open to sabotage and technical failure.|$|E

5|$|During {{the events}} of Halo 2, the Covenant and humans {{discover}} a second ringworld, Installation 05, or Delta Halo. It was monitored by 2401 Penitent Tangent, who completely ignored Flood warnings and was captured by their leader, the Gravemind. The Covenant leadership wants to activate the installation, believing it {{is the key to}} their salvation. At the same time, the Flood, led by an intelligence known as the Gravemind, lay siege to the Covenant's city-ship, High Charity. After 343 Guilty Spark informs Halo's true purpose to the Arbiter, a Covenant holy warrior, of the danger that the Halos truly represent, a group of humans and Covenant Elites prevent the firing of the ring. The unexpected shutdown activates a <b>fail-safe</b> protocol, priming the remaining Halo installations for remote activation from a location known as The Ark.|$|E
5|$|Herschel wedges, {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is {{destined for the}} eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface {{of a piece of}} glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected. The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device <b>fail-safe.</b> Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} {{may suffer}} thermal runaway and cell rupture if overheated or overcharged, and {{in extreme cases}} {{this can lead to}} combustion. To reduce these risks, lithium-ion battery packs contain <b>fail-safe</b> circuitry that shuts down the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range. When handled improperly, or if manufactured defectively, some rechargeable batteries can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Especially prone to thermal runaway are lithium-ion batteries. Reports of exploding cellphones have been reported in newspapers. In 2006, batteries from Apple, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell and other notebook manufacturers were recalled because of fire and explosions. Also, during the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's first year of service, at least four aircraft suffered from electrical system problems stemming from its lithium-ion batteries, resulting in the whole Dreamliner fleet being voluntarily grounded in January 2013.|$|E
5000|$|When adding {{equipment}} is impractical (usually because of expense), then {{the least expensive}} form of design is often [...] "inherently fail-safe". That is, change the system design so its failure modes are not catastrophic. Inherent <b>fail-safes</b> are common in medical equipment, traffic and railway signals, communications equipment, and safety equipment.|$|R

5|$|One {{week later}} the FIA {{announced}} a review panel {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals, and published its findings four weeks later. The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident. Instead, the contributing factors were found to include track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the circuit. The report also made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering stricken vehicles — which were subsequently introduced for the 2015 season — before concluding that {{it would not have been}} possible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries through changes to the cockpit design. The report also revealed that the <b>fail-safe</b> for the car's brake-by-wire system had failed. Despite this, Marussia was not found to be responsible for the accident.|$|E
5|$|This {{one-shot}} {{issue was}} published in March 1993. The story was originally published in graphic-novel form in 1991 as Avengers-Deathtrap: The Vault (1991), but was later reprinted under the Venom label. As a result, the fictional events precede those of Venom: Lethal Protector and are referenced in that series. The issue follows a supervillain prison outbreak at The Vault, led by Brock, that allows the inmates to overrun the prison and take its staff hostage. The Avengers and Freedom Force attempt to defeat the villains in a race against time because the prison's final <b>fail-safe,</b> a powerful explosive device, has been activated by Vault warden Truman Marsh. DCD estimated that the comic was their 13th-bestselling trade paperback of 1993.|$|E
5|$|When Altares {{encounters}} a star cluster, Anna tells Jane of Einstein's accomplishments {{in the areas}} of special relativity and unified field theory. Shortly after, the ship is hit by a meteor shower that damages various systems and causes the photon drive to re-activate, hurling Altares through space at such velocity that the travellers are knocked out. A <b>fail-safe</b> brings the vessel, now powerless, to a halt within the gravitational field of a red giant on the brink of supernova. Donning a heat suit, Captain Masters risks his life by entering the reactor core in a bid to repair the drive. He succeeds, and Anna and Jane pilot the ship outside the blast radius of the star before it explodes.|$|E
50|$|Miller made 20 recommendations, mainly {{concerning}} better administrative {{policy to}} ensure the protection of wards of Child Services, <b>fail-safes</b> for catching abuse, and better training and placement for staff working directly with youth and in sensitive situations.

5|$|Between {{the events}} of the first game and Halo 2, the Chief and a few other {{survivors}} return to Earth, warning of an impending Covenant attack; this attack forms the first mission of the game. Meanwhile, the Covenant, unaware of the destructive nature of the rings, attempt to fire another ring, Installation 05, to fulfill their religious prophecy and to do so launch an attack on Earth. Helping the Chief to defend the Earth are Sergeant Avery Johnson and Commander Miranda Keyes. One race in the Covenant, the Elites, learn the truth about the rings and are led by a former Elite commander named the Arbiter (also a player character) to join forces with humanity to stop the firing of the ring. Though they are successful, the unexpected shutdown of the installation triggers a <b>fail-safe</b> protocol, priming all the rings for firing from the Ark.|$|E
5|$|By {{the events}} of Drakengard 3, Zero had forged a {{partnership}} with the dragon Michael: as dragons are the only beings that can destroy Intoners, Michael would help Zero kill her sisters, then kill her to finish off the flower. Their first attempt to take down all the Intoners ends in disaster, with Zero losing her arm and Michael being wounded and forced to reincarnate as the child dragon Mikhail. During their second attempt, they attack each one individually: after killing one, Zero takes on their disciple, a servant created to magnify the Intoners' powers, who each help in battle and act as a personal harem. Before facing One, Zero reverts her disciples to their original bird forms, releasing them from their servitude. During the battle, both One and Mikhail are killed, then Zero is killed by a male clone of One created as a <b>fail-safe</b> in the event of Zero's victory.|$|E
5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The chain of events, as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started with {{a failure of the}} hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation. The gunner responsible for closing and locking the breech failed to do so and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing, was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training the gun to be concerned with this matter. He delegated the checkup routine to an enlisted man, but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the breech lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical <b>fail-safe</b> interlocks to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Clark and Lisa {{celebrate}} of {{the latter}} obtaining {{a job as a}} model. Unbeknownst to them, Lisa accidentally drops one of her earrings on Clark's couch. At The Daily Planet, Clark and Jim discuss why Lois is investigating his past. Jim reveals to Clark that Lois is jealous of Clark's Superman story. Lois subsequently warns Superman that she learned from her uncle, a United Nations delegate, that the U.N. is developing <b>fail-safes</b> against Superman.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} proposes {{a series of}} {{multilevel}} double hashing schemes called cascade hash tables. They use several levels of hash tables.

Poisonous gas is released into the ore processing unit.|$|R
5|$|The very {{expensive}} project of 1910, costing Coandă about one million francs, {{left him with}} limited funds. The possibility of a new contract with the French government led Coandă to build the Coandă-1911. He wished to win an army-organised competition at Reims in October, one that required two engines in each aircraft as a <b>fail-safe</b> strategy. At the third aviation salon in Paris 1911, Coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two Gnome rotary engines mounted back to back, connected by a bevel gear to a single two-bladed propeller. The combination of two engines connected to one propeller was originally intended to drive a new turbine, but Coandă was unable to fund one. During trials the assembly did not provide enough traction and a four-bladed propeller was ordered. The mounting support of the engines, initially intended for a jet propulsion version, was not adequate for the new configuration so the forward chassis had to be modified.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{the concept of}} {{robustness}} in neuroscience. Various mechanisms for making systems robust have been discussed across biology and neuroscience (e. g. redundancy and <b>fail-safes).</b> Many of these notions originate from engineering.

Furthermore, I argue that the significant disanalogies between brains and engineered artefacts raise important questions about {{the applicability of the}} engineering framework. I argue that the use of such concepts should be understood as a kind of simplifying idealization...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, Poka yoke {{as one of}} the {{effective}} quality design techniques experienced in manufacturing has been suggested and developed for service <b>fail-safing.</b> For this purpose, the subjects of service failure and service recovery have been introduced. Then, service Poka yoke has been demonstrated and its solutions have been classified. This paper also has proposed a framework, by which the common and uncommon elements of service Poka yoke and Service recovery solutions have been classified and addressed schematically. In the new methodology, service recovery and service Poka yoke are assumed as post and pre solutions on service failure, respectively. The proposed framework seems very helpful for managers as an effective toolbox if they are about to fix problems both at the design and at the delivery stages of the service processes. Finally, some barriers and critical success factors of the application of Poka yoke in services have been discussed...|$|R
