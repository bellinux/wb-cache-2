500|$|On 27 February 2007, the Spanish Family Forum {{presented}} an initiative signed by 1.5 million people to legislate marriage as {{the union of}} a man and a woman only (thus effectively prohibiting same-sex marriage). The initiative was rejected by the Spanish Congress. On 30 May 2007, the aforementioned judge of Dénia was condemned by the Disciplinary Committee of the General Council of Judiciary Power (Comisión Disciplinaria del Consejo General del Poder Judicial -CGPJ-) to pay 305 euros for refusing to marry a gay couple and was also strictly warned against <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> She attributes this action to the [...] "propagandistic machinery" [...] of the Government.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Lewis told Tom Eames that Glassheart has a running theme about [...] "star-crossed lovers that can't be together", {{and so it was}} likely that this idea would feature on the tour. Lewis also cited William Shakespeare as another source of inspiration. She spent the three days of the final tour rehearsals at The Backstage Centre in Purfleet, Essex (UK). The Glassheart Tour was scheduled to visit twenty-one venues across Germany and the United Kingdom. The tour was expected to begin on 15 April in Berlin. The list had expanded from an initial sixteen to include five dates in Germany. Lewis would then proceed with UK dates beginning in Glasgow, including two dates at London's Royal Albert Hall before finishing on 18 May in Plymouth. Speaking about the tour, Lewis said [...] "I can't wait {{to get out there and}} play my new songs. I had such fun on my last tour and I'm really excited about <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> next year." [...] Barclaycard ran a competition which gave fans the chance to win tickets to 6 May concert at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Jackson {{released}} her eighth studio album, Damita Jo. The album debuted at number two on Billboard 200, was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and sold over three million copies worldwide. However, its singles received minimal airplay {{due to a}} blacklist of Jackson's music and videos on many music channels and radio formats caused by legalities surrounding the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. Jackson then decided to start {{to work on a}} new project in the coming year, involving her then-fiancé, record producer Jermaine Dupri, who was commissioned to executive produce the project, in addition to a number of other producers. She decided to create a modern record, while returning to dance music, in the vein of her hit album, Control (1986). Producer Jimmy Jam revealed that while recording the album, Janet became more confident with her writing ability, doing the bulk of the writing. He also commented, [...] "We're all kind of back in there <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> together, which I really enjoy." [...] It's the physical nature of sitting in the same room and really hashing it out. It's like, 'You're not going to leave until we have a lyric,' so it's fun." [...] Jackson and Jimmy both agreed that Dupri molded well into their tri due to him being a fan of Jam and Lewis' work and vice versa.|$|E

At 6:39p.m., Ravi tweeted, [...] "Anyone with iChat, I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes, it's happening again." [...] Ravi had set up the webcam and initially pointed it towards Clementi's bed. Ravi has stated that he realized that his [...] "joke" [...] was [...] "stupid", and pointed the webcam towards his own bed before the planned viewing on September 21. The police say, however, that it was subsequently found still pointed directly at Clementi's bed. When Ravi's friend suggested that Clementi and his guest might use his bed, Ravi said [...] "My webcam checks my bed, hahaha." [...] At trial, two Rutgers students testified that Ravi had spent part of that early evening in their dorm rooms, and used their computers to verify that the webcam was still focused on the bed. The captain of Ravi's Ultimate Frisbee team testified that, after practice that evening, Ravi [...] "told me he had set up a webcam of some sort to capture images of his roommate. He told me he had done it before that date" [...] and [...] "that he was planning on <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> That night." [...] When Clementi returned to his room, he noticed the camera and texted a friend saying he had unplugged Ravi's powerstrip to prevent further video streaming during his date. Ravi has said that he had changed his mind regarding the broadcast and disabled the camera himself by putting the computer in sleep mode.|$|E
