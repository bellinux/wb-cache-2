40|$|Usually, {{there are}} two types of <b>fishing</b> <b>lamp</b> used by bagan {{fisherman}} to attract and catch fish: pressured kerosene lamp and electric lamp. The first type is commonly used on the small sized bagan like raft bagan in Pelabuhan Ratu Bay and the second type is used on the large bagan like boat bagan (known as "bagan rambo" in south Sulawesi) in Makassar strait. 	The pattern of light intensity distribution of both fishing lamps in the air was almost the same, i. e., is butterfly shaped. The highest intensity was recorded at the angle of 90,??? i. e., 170 lx for kerosene and 2, 700 lx for mercury lamps. The pattern of the underwater light intensity was found different between the bagan. Due to the pattern of light position and lighting power, mercury lamps can illuminate deeper water column than pressured kerosene lamp. At 8 m depth The underwater illumination of boat bagan and raft bagan were 47 lx and 0. 1 lx, respectively. 	The catch of both bagan was dominated by anchovy Stolephorus sp. The others species caught are spotted sardinella Sardinella sirm, scad mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, fringe-scale sardine Sardinella fimbriata, black tipped ponyfish Leiognathus splendens, squid Loligo sp and stripped mackerel Rastreliger kanagurta. Skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis and barred spanis mackerel Scomberomorus commersoni were only caught by boat bagan. It is supposed that boat bagan was operated in the off-shore waters.

The epitokes occurred in the period from late February to mid-November. The peak of epitokal swarming activity was in warm season, but its time in the season differed among years, i. e. late June in 1992 and early April in 1993, presumably, depending on weather conditions. The synchronous epitokal swarming was evidenced, superficially as asymmetrically semi-lunar with the major concentration of activity around {{a few days after}} full moon. The difference in the periodicity from the Californian forms exhibiting swarming activity around new moon is postulated to be attributable to populational genetic difference, if it is not due to the artificial induction of swarming by using a <b>fish</b> <b>lamp</b> in the present form. In either case, an annual relative density of the present species which may be an useful indicator of the environmental quality of coastal waters including eelgrass beds can be given by the samplings of epitokes using a <b>fish</b> <b>lamp</b> in the evening a few days after full moon and new moon in the warmer months from March to September...|$|R

40|$|Factors that {{influence}} squid catch {{of the coastal}} squid jigging fishery were analyzed using data sets recorded by 9 boats in Tsushima Strait in January and February 2010 including daily catch amount, lighting pattern of <b>fishing</b> <b>lamps,</b> presence of dolphins during operations, {{and the number of}} other jigging boats operating within 2 nautical miles from the boat. Generalized linear modeling analysis indicated that catch is explained by the fishing ability of the captain and crew of each boat, illuminated fraction of the moon (lunar phase) and presence of dolphin, with assuming monthly differences in squid abundance. Influences on lighting patterns of <b>fishing</b> <b>lamps</b> and number of operating boats around the boat that fishermen always have keen interests are not detected in the analysis. The factor of fishing ability of the captain and crew of the boat may be interrupted as the ability to search the promising fishing locations in the fishing ground.

The author observed {{the relation between the}} behavior of mackerel and the sea conditions. The mackerel apparently shoaled along the current rip which was formed between the continental coast water and the Kuroshio warm water. However, as the water temperature changed rapidly, the behavior of the mackerel also changed markedly. When <b>fish</b> <b>lamp</b> was switched on, the mackerel were attracted to the light and schooled in the surface layer of water, but they often went down into the deep layer with the entire school. While they were in the surface layer, sometimes they voraciously bit at the bait but sometimes they showed no interest to the bait at all. The causes of these phenomena will be clarified in the future. 旧長崎丸でサバはね釣を実習した記録によって,サバはね釣漁場の漁獲と海況の関係を考察した｡東支那海では,大陸沿岸水と黒汐系水の汐境にサバが集るが,海況が短時間に変化するので,魚群の行動もこれに伴って複雑に変化する｡集魚灯やまき餌をしても浮上しなかったり,浮上しても釣れなかったりする｡薩南漁場では根付と思われるゴマサバがよく釣れたが,ムロアジが群来するとゴマサバは去った｡五島嵯峨ソネ漁場ではゴマサバが主に釣れたが,浮上時問が短かかった｡これらサバの習性について今後明らかにしたい...|$|R

We tested a stepwise lighting method termed "stage reduced lighting" in the Tsushima Strait in January and February 2010 using nine fishing boats. LEDs (9 kW) and 50 MHs (150 kW) were lit for 3. 9 h on average, and then the number of MHs was reduced to either 30 or 36 until the end of fishing (7. 3 h on average).

40|$|Light fishing has rapidly {{developed}} and widely {{spread all over}} Indonesia. In the past, lamps (kerosene-pressured lamp) was used in shallow coastal fishing using scoop net and hand line. Nowadays, <b>fishing</b> with <b>lamp</b> (electric lamp), is widely practices from the coastal fishery to offshore fisheries in combination for boat seine, lift net, purse seine etc. In the new millennium, there are two aspects development of light fishing technology, are how to increase the catch, {{but at the same}} time how to conserve the fish resources which is an implementation of sustainable fisheries. In Indonesia, research on the impact of light fishing has been limited especially for purse seine and lift net (bagan). Bagan is a lift net formed of box-shaped net with fine mesh size of 0. 5 cm, operated with lamp for attracting pelagic species. The purpose of this paper is to review of some research on light fishing in Wallacea Area in Indonesia in relation to the impact on sustainable fisheries with special reference to purse seine and lift net. These two fishing gears have different characteristic in relation to the fish species. In the respect of first of maturity of fish, purse seine is friendly for big eye scad but did not friendly for sardine and Indian mackerel. On the other hand, purse seine produces low by catch and discarded catch. The other fishing gear, lift net of bagan rambo (large typed lift-net), generate negative impact which catch higher number of immature fish such as Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) and Russel scad (Decapterus ruselly) and this gear needs high energy consumption for <b>fish</b> <b>lamp.</b> According to the biological aspect bagan rambo was, however environmentally friendly for ancovy (Stolephorus insularis) big eye scad and big size pelagic fish with less amount of discarded catch. It is very important that fishing regulation which is declared in the Code of Conduct for Sustainable Fisheries (CCRF) is to reduce catching the juvenile fish. Therefore, an environmentally friendly light fishing technology should be considered in the near future. To establish the environmentally friendly technology of lift net (bagan), better management of fishing unit, fishing ground and the fishing season should be taken in the first priority. Meanwhile, necessary other factors are strongly considered such as improving mesh selectivity of fishing gear and increase of awareness of fishermen to be more responsibl...|$|R

Moreover, {{it was found that}} degrees of fish's aversion to light vary not only with blinking frequencies and contrast ratios of intermittent light and wavelengths of light, but also with the state of dark/light adaptation of fish's eye. In addition, the limit within which the school showed aversion to the intermittent light were different from the limits obtained from the physiological studies, such as critical fusion frequency and the differental threshold of brightness and darkness. Acclimation to light is another subject to be checked, when behavior of fish school in response to lights is obseved. The experiment was undertaken to clarify the acclimational influence on the fish's aversion to intermittent light. There was almost no change in fish's appearance times, even after continuous projection of intermittent light for 4 hours. That is, an acclimation phenomenon was not detected. On the contrary, it is known that the alluring effect of a <b>fish</b> attracting <b>lamp</b> on a school of horse mackerel, mackerel, and sardine starts to decrease 2 - 3 hours after the operation. It was concluded that the occurrence of the acclimation phenomenon in the fish's aversion to intermittent light was far less than for the case of the alluring effect by continuous lights. 　Behavioral activation and inactivation can also be regarded as the general efｆects of light on the behavior of a fish school. Moving speeds of the fish school exposed to constant and intermittent lights were compared. The average moving speed under the constant light was about 20 cm/s, ｗhile the speed under the intermittent light was 14 cm/s. This means that the fish's moving speeds under the intermittent light was reduced by 30 % of its speed under the constant light. It seems that the slowing down of the fish's moving speeds can be considered as an indication of fish's aversion to the intermittent light. II Control of a fish school's behavior with a leader net made of a projected beam In order to apply the above-mentioned results to the control of a fish school's behavior, a multiple beam projector was constructed. 1) Multiple beam projeetor The multiple beam projector was designed to irradiate the 8 beams having an angle of 2 degrees to the optical axis, a diameter of 26 mm, and a maximum projecting irradiance of 2, 000 lx. Both the blinking frequency and the contrast ratio could be changed. A light from a halogen lamp was converted into intermittent lights by a rotating shutter disk (optical chopper). The wavelength of light longer than 750 nm was cut out with infared absorbing filter. The light was distributed to 8 optical fibers, and projected as 8 beams from the terminal lenses of each fiber. For the experiments, 8 beams having a blinking frequency of 1. 36 c/s were projected orthogonally and vertically to the circular free passage with 12 cm intervals, that is, by creating a leader net of light. Under such lightings, the movements of the school were traced. The same kind of experiment was repeatedly carried on, by irradiances of the beams being changed into 8 grades from 1, 235 to 0. 025 lx and background irradiances of 0. 1 lx and 0. 003 lx. 2) Response to the leader net made of light The leader net of light having irradiances of the beam over 0. 25 lx for dark adaptation (background irradiance, 0. 003 lx), and over 506 lx for light adaptation (background irradiance, 0. 1 lx) were confirmed to exert a prominent barrier effect on the swimming behavior of the school of fish. In other words, the obstruction effect of the net against the passage of a fish school occurred under a dark adaptation with the contrast ratio of the beam being more than 83 : 1 and under a light adaptation with the ratio being over 5, 060 : 1. In order to apply such an effect to practical fisheries, an estimation was made on the effective range of the leader net of light which could obstruct the passage of a fish school, using the coastal waters of Sagami Bay as an example. Results of the estimation indicated that a fish could find the leader net of light at a horizontal distance of 30 m, with the effective range of about 16 m, Factors were set as follows: underwater irradiance, less than 0. 01 |x; differential threshold of the fish's eye, 0. 05; and beam attenuation coefficient, 0. 5 m- 1. Vertical downward projection of beams with 2, 000 lx irradiance was used as the condition for the construction of the leader net. Consequently, satisfactory passage obstruction effect by the ieader net of light can be expected in practicai fisheries. Since {{it has been reported that}} underwater irradiance in the Sagami Bay was reduced by 10 - 3 even at a depth of 20 m from the surface, applcatbn of natural lghts to the leader net of light could be considered a support, by introducing the surface lights into the sea through optical fibers in the daytime. In addition, the behavior-controlling effect could be improved further by changing the direction and phase of the beam. This study made it clear through a series of experiments on Japanese horse mackerel, Trachurus japonicus, that an inconstant lighting conditoon can exert a remarkable influence on fish schooling behavior. Further development of the achievement will result in its broad applications to fisheries and culture fisheries in the future, such as in the alluring and controlling of the swimming behavior of a fish school...|$|R
