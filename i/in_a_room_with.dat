5|$|Each episode {{typically}} follows Bauer, {{officials in}} the U.S. government, and the conspirators behind {{the events of the}} day, often simultaneously. 24 is known for employing plot twists which may arise as antagonists adapt, objectives evolve or larger-scale operations unfold. Stories also involve interpersonal drama, delving into the private lives of the characters. As part of a recurring theme, characters are frequently confronted with ethical dilemmas. Examples of this are a bombing in Season 2, which can only be prevented by blowing Bauer's cover, and an ultimatum in Season 3, in which a terrorist agrees not to carry out an attack if a high-ranking CTU official is killed. Season 4 is also notable for a scene in which two men — one of whom possesses crucial information — are dying <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> only one surgeon.|$|E

5|$|In Seattle, {{two friends}} argue about {{applying}} for college. Landon Bryce (Christopher Kennedy Masterson) tells his friend Howard Gordon (Michael R. Coleman) to apply, but Gordon has been convinced by school counselor Teresa Roe (Mariangela Pino) that his progress is too mediocre {{to make it}} worthwhile. Bryce accosts Roe, calling her a failure. That night, Gordon is killed, and Bryce is kidnapped. Millennium Group criminal profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) learns that Gordon {{died of a heart}} attack, which the coroner believes was caused by fear. Black visits the crime scene, and sees visions of Lucy Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond), a woman who killed his friend and colleague Bob Bletcher (in season one's Lamentation). Meanwhile, Bryce is bound and gagged in a remote farmhouse, then left <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> the would-be escapee. The woman from earlier tells Bryce she loves him.|$|E
5|$|The agents find Banton at {{the train}} station, but he runs to a poorly lit area. He {{declares}} that walking into his shadow will kill the agents, so Mulder shoots out the overhead lights. Banton allows himself {{to be taken to}} a mental hospital, where he is put <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> soft light per his own request. He tells the agents that the accident in his lab caused his shadow to behave like a black hole, splitting atoms into component particles and reducing matter into pure energy. Banton claims that the deaths were all accidents, and that the government wants to exploit him. Detective Ryan and her superior officer stop the questioning, declaring the case closed, despite Mulder's objections. Mulder contacts X (Steven Williams), who assures him that the government has no interest in Banton. However, X and two associates later attempt to remove Banton from the hospital by cutting the power. In the process, the two attendants are killed when the emergency lights turn on and Banton's shadow falls upon them. Banton flees from the hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Secret of Evermore {{begins with a}} black and white {{flashback}} to 1965, in a small town called Podunk, USA. In a laboratory situated on the roof of a mansion, a malfunction occurs which floods the area with white flash of light. Thirty years later, the game's young protagonist is leaving a theater when his pet dog chases after a cat in the street. The boy hurriedly follows after him, eventually reaching a large, abandoned mansion. He discovers the hidden laboratory with a large machine built in the center. When the dog begins to chew on some wires, the pair find themselves transported to the surreal world of Evermore, beginning in the space station Omnitopia. A butler dressed in a white tuxedo greets the boy when he appears, only to lock him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> several attack robots. The boy manages to escape in a shuttle pod, where he finds his dog holed up in the cockpit.|$|E

5|$|The {{victims were}} gassed with diesel exhaust {{from the engine}} of a Red Army tank. SS-Scharführer Erich Fuchs was {{responsible}} for installing it. The engine was brought in by the SS {{at the time of}} the camp's construction and housed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> a generator that supplied the camp with electricity. The tank engine exhaust pipe ran just below the ground and opened into all three gas chambers. The fumes could be seen seeping out. After about 20 minutes the bodies were removed by dozens of Sonderkommandos, placed onto carts and wheeled away. The system was imperfect and required a lot of effort; trains that arrived later in the day had to wait on layover tracks overnight at Treblinka, Małkinia, or Wólka Okrąglik.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Paramore holding {{electric}} guitars, heading towards {{the side of}} a bridge. They begin smashing clocks with guitars on a roadside, and a title screen appears, announcing that the band broke the record of smashing 30 clocks with guitars— at a time of 31.33 seconds. The camera shifts to a room where the group attempts to catch flying feathers; Davis breaks the record of catching the most (18) feathers in 30 s. The next scene shows the group wearing eye goggles, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> white walls, destroying vinyl records in several ways—such as ripping them, stepping on them or punching them. The band breaks another record, after smashing 58 vinyl records in a minute, the highest number of broken records for that time. While the band is destroying more records, York makes a record as an individual by spinning a record on his finger for 32.81 s—the least time ever for that accomplishment.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E

All of the children refrained from playing with the forbidden toy (the steam shovel).|$|E
