5|$|Life in the Middle Ages {{centred on}} the {{families}} who owned the manor {{in what was then}} an isolated rural community. Agriculture, <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> weaving, quarrying and mining occupied the few inhabitants until the middle of the 19th century. A chapel built before 1541 was replaced by the present church in 1666 and by 1703 Nonconformism led to the building of a Presbyterian church, now a Unitarian Chapel. A grammar school was founded by charter of Queen Elizabeth I in 1556.|$|E
5|$|Power looms {{introduced}} in the early 19th century {{put an end to}} the last remnants of the domestic system in Crompton, but not without resistance. Weavers and spinners were paid according to the amount of cloth they produced; independent <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> weavers saw a drop in their income, and could not compete with the mechanised mass production that was gathering pace in the township. Luddites rioted in the township in 1826, smashing 24power looms at Clegg's mill at High Crompton in protest against their worsening standard of living.|$|E
5|$|Until the 19th century Rivington was a rural village {{built around}} {{what is now}} the village green. Its {{inhabitants}} were employed in agriculture on scattered local farms, <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> weaving in their own homes, working in the local quarries or the small coal mines on Winter Hill Coal mining was on a very small scale. Nicholas Fish, Brooker and Company had a coal pit on Wilders Moor that was mentioned on the 1869 and 1880 mines lists. in 1896 the Rivington Moor Colliery employed two workers mining coal from the Mountain coal seam for own or local use.|$|E

25|$|The <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> with {{jacquard}} is {{a wooden}} <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> {{typical of the}} many thousands of looms {{that were used in}} the domestic cottage industry throughout the British Isles. They were gradually replaced by all-metal looms (see the Hattersley domestic loom) and new methods of working practice, such as the factory system, during the Industrial Revolution. The loom has a four-shuttle drop box to weave up to four colours of weft, and has John Kay's flying shuttle method of inserting the weft. Most of the handlooms used in the home were ordinary shaft looms. These do not require roof space and would be weaving standard cloths, unlike this loom which is fitted with a 360 hook de Vogue jacquard and can weave very complex fabrics.|$|E
25|$|When a <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> {{was located}} in the home, {{children}} helped with the weaving process from an early age. Piecing needs dexterity, and a child can be as productive as an adult. When weaving moves from the home to the mill, children are often allowed to help their older sisters, and laws {{have to be made}} to prevent child labour becoming established.|$|E
25|$|While in the past, the {{majority}} of jumpers and other Aran garments were knitted by hand, today {{the majority}} of items for sale in Ireland and elsewhere are either machine knit or produced on a <b>hand</b> <b>loom.</b> There are very few people still knitting jumpers by hand on a commercial basis but hand knit jumpers are still available at local craft initiatives.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1760s, textile {{production}} was {{a cottage industry}} using mainly flax and wool. A typical weaving family would own one <b>hand</b> <b>loom,</b> which would be operated by the man with help of a boy; the wife, girls and other women could make sufficient yarn for that loom. The knowledge of textile production had existed for centuries, and the manual methods had adequately provided enough cloth {{for the needs of}} that society.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> {{with the}} witch {{is typical of}} many {{that were used in}} the mills by cloth {{designers}} to develop new fabric designs and patterns. They are still used in the textile departments of universities and colleges for training students in weaving and the designing of fabrics. The shafts are lifted by a witch, an early form of dobby, with weights underneath to pull the shafts down, and can work up to 50 shafts to produce very complicated patterns. The weft is put in by hand using the flying shuttle method invented in 1733 by John Kay, and up to four colours can be woven in the weft using Robert Kay's (son of John Kay) 1760 invention of the multiple shuttle box. On this simple-to-operate loom the designer is able to explore the application of new design ideas before beginning production trials on a wider loom. Many of the designs for woven fabrics made today were developed and created long ago on similar narrow-width pattern looms.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the dense}} {{forestry}} in Giresun, woodwork {{is among the}} common handcrafts in the region. Some small wooden handcrafts peculiar to the city are churns, külek (a storing pot for cheese), and spoons. One of the oldest handcrafts in the city is weaving. Wool, linen threads and similar raw marerials are spun in <b>hand</b> <b>looms</b> to produce various local clothes, heybe (shoulder bags) and bags. Strong threads and knitted threads are also produced in <b>hand</b> <b>looms.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In {{the peak}} years of {{handloom}} weaving around 1820, there were 170,000 handloom weavers in Lancashire. The 1851 census recorded 55,000 <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> weavers {{in the county}} while the 1861 census records 30,000 and the 1871 census 10,000. By 1891, few were left.

2500|$|The 1790 mule was {{operated}} by brute force: the spinner drawing and pushing the frame while attending to each spindle. Home spinning was {{the occupation of}} women and girls, but the strength needed to operate a mule caused {{it to be the}} activity of men. <b>Hand</b> <b>loom</b> weaving, however, had been a man's occupation but in the mill it could and was done by girls and women. Spinners were the bare-foot aristocrats of the factory system. It replace decentralized cottage industries with centralized factory jobs, driving economic upheaval and urbanization ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the eve of}} the Industrial Revolution, {{spinning}} and weaving were done in households, for domestic consumption and as a cottage industry under the putting-out system. [...] Occasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver. Under the putting-out system, home-based workers produced under contract to merchant sellers, who often supplied the raw materials. [...] In the off season the women, typically farmers' wives, did the {{spinning and}} the men did the weaving. [...] Using the spinning wheel, it took anywhere from four to eight spinners to supply one <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> weaver. [...] The flying shuttle patented in 1733 by John Kay, with a number of subsequent improvements including an important one in 1747, doubled the output of a weaver, worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving. [...] It became widely used around Lancashire after 1760 when John's son, Robert, invented the drop box, which facilitated changing thread colors.|$|E

2500|$|Tamil Nadu {{is one of}} {{the leading}} States in the textile sector and it houses the country's largest {{spinning}} industry accounting for almost 80 per cent of the total installed capacity in India. When it comes to yarn production, the State contributes 40 per cent of the total production in the country. There are 2,614 Hand Processing Units (25 per cent of total units in the country) and 985 Power Processing Units (40 per cent of total units in the country) in Tamil Nadu. According to official data, the textile industry in Tamil Nadu accounts for 17 per cent of the total invested capital in all the industries. Coimbatore is often referred to as the [...] "Manchester of South India" [...] due to its cotton production and textile industries.

The region around Coimbatore, Tirupur, Palladam, Karur and Erode is referred to as the [...] "Textile Valley of India" [...] with the export from the Tirupur [...] 50,000 million ($1,000million) and Karur generates around [...] 35,500 million ($750million) a year in foreign exchange. Rajapalayam, Gobichettipalayam, Pollachi, Udumalpet, Theni and Vedasandur are known for its cotton spinning mills. Gobichettipalayam is a prominent producer of white silk with the country's first automated silk reeling unit present here.

60|$|Meanwhile, the {{practical}} character {{of our work}} has shown itself in efforts to help in various ways the lowest {{of the people to}} improve their circumstances. The need for this is instantly apparent when one reflects that some 40,000,000 of the inhabitants of India are always hungry. A system of loan banks, which has now been adopted in part by the Government, has been of great service to the small agriculturalists. The invention of an extremely simple and yet greatly improved <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> has proved, and will prove, very valuable to the weavers. New plans of relief in times of scarcity and famine have also greatly helped in some districts to win the confidence of the people. Industrial schools, chiefly for orphan children, have also been a feature of the work in some districts.|$|E
50|$|Another {{reason for}} this sea {{of change in the}} {{aptitude}} of the inhabitants is the low price per unit put into making these <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> items; the overheads being much too higher for houses having lesser looms that the ones, mass-producing these items with the help of separate work place close to the residence. All such varieties, which were reserved for exclusive production in the <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> sector, are now extensively and widely produced in power looms making the <b>hand</b> <b>loom</b> products not competitive in the market.|$|E
