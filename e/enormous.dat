5|$|A Gothic {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The screen is composed of three <b>enormous</b> open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that two towers of very different height pop up from behind the screen. Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the <b>enormous</b> diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E
5|$|In Iran, {{the impact}} was <b>enormous</b> and {{according}} to an estimation, between 902,400 and 2,431,000 or 8.0% and 21.7% {{of the total population}} died.|$|E
5|$|Judging by his {{achievements}} alone, {{he must have}} been a remarkable man. He had <b>enormous</b> drive, an ability to remain calm despite <b>enormous</b> pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He was a man of honour who always kept his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E
5|$|POWER and SPARC {{remained}} strong, {{while the}} 32-bit x86 architecture {{continued to grow}} into the enterprise space, building on economies of scale fueled by its <b>enormous</b> installed base.|$|E
5|$|September 13, 1988- Squalls {{from the}} <b>enormous</b> Hurricane Gilbert bring rain to South Florida {{as the storm}} lashed the Cayman Islands in the western Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|The <b>enormous</b> {{effect of}} the Sun on Earth has been {{recognized}} since prehistoric times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity.|$|E
5|$|The narrow pavement, {{which could}} {{accommodate}} {{a maximum of}} 12,000 per day, was transformed into an <b>enormous</b> plaza that could hold in excess of 400,000.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the member}} states of the Eurasian Economic Union's populations are {{comparatively}} large, its density is low because of the <b>enormous</b> size of Russia and Kazakhstan.|$|E
5|$|Toucans are near-passerine birds {{from the}} Neotropics. They are brightly marked and have <b>enormous</b> {{colorful}} bills {{which in some}} species amount to half their body length.|$|E
5|$|A {{similarly}} <b>enormous</b> {{number of}} lac bugs {{are needed to}} make a kilogram of shellac, a brush-on colourant and wood finish. Additional uses of this traditional product include the waxing of citrus fruits to extend their shelf-life, and the coating of pills to moisture-proof them, provide slow-release or mask the taste of bitter ingredients.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, {{service members}} {{returned}} to the area, spurring an <b>enormous</b> population explosion which dwarfed the 1920s boom. The 1960 Census counted 83,648 people in the city, about 230% of the 1950 figure. A 1967 report estimated {{that the city was}} approximately 85% developed, and the 1970 population figure was 139,590.|$|E
5|$|An {{abbreviated}} {{and less}} profane {{version of the}} speech became iconic thanks to the 1970 movie Patton, where it was performed by the actor George C. Scott while standing before an <b>enormous</b> American flag. The performance was instrumental in bringing Patton into popular culture and transforming him into a folk hero.|$|E
5|$|Anarky's {{abilities}} were increased {{during the}} character's two eponymous series, being portrayed as having <b>enormous</b> talents in both engineering and computer technology, {{as well as}} prodigiously developing skills in martial arts. This was indicated in several comics published just before the Anarky miniseries, and later elaborated upon within the series itself.|$|E
5|$|As {{construction}} began, Tenrikyo followers {{founded the}} Oyasato Construction Young Men's Association Hinokishin Corps, which volunteered time and labor {{to help build}} the yakata. The corps still continues their work today. By 1956, {{one corner of the}} complex had been built at the cost of 23billion yen, an <b>enormous</b> expense given the economic depression of the time.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1917, the British and French were still searching {{for a way to}} achieve a strategic breakthrough on the Western Front. The previous year had been marked by the costly success of the Anglo-French offensive astride the river Somme, while the French had been unable to take the initiative because of intense German pressure at Verdun until after August 1916. The battles consumed <b>enormous</b> quantities of resources while achieving virtually no strategic gains on the battlefield. The cost to Germany of containing the Anglo-French attacks had been <b>enormous</b> and given that the material preponderance of the Entente and its allies could only be expected to increase in 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided on a defensive strategy on the Western Front for that year. This impasse reinforced the French and British commanders' belief that to end the stalemate they needed a breakthrough; while this desire may have been the main impetus behind the offensive, the timing and location were influenced by political and tactical considerations.|$|E
5|$|British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was {{concerned}} that, given the <b>enormous</b> size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe {{at the end}} of the war, and the perception that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was unreliable, there existed a Soviet threat to Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|By March 1945 the Luftwaffe {{had lost}} air superiority over all fronts. Western Allied Air Forces held air {{supremacy}} over the German Reich and remaining German-occupied territory. German industrial cities were now subjected to intensive bombardment which inflicted <b>enormous</b> {{damage on the}} German war effort. The United States Army Air Forces attacked by day, while RAF Bomber Command operated by night.|$|E
5|$|Cyrus {{performed}} the song during the Gypsy Heart Tour. She also {{performed the}} song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour. She {{wore a black}} sequined bra and furry monochrome chaps with falconry gloves during the performance. She was also accompanied by an <b>enormous</b> replica of her dog, Floyd. The performance received positive reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|Due {{in part to}} the {{political}} conditions in what would become a united Kingdom of Italy only in 1861, the variation of apothecaries' systems and standard weights in this region was <b>enormous.</b> (For background information, see History of Italy during foreign domination and the unification.) The libbra (pound) generally consisted of the standard twelve ounces, however.|$|E
5|$|Events in {{southern}} Britain to 796 have sometimes been {{portrayed as a}} struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity in their power was <b>enormous.</b> By 796 Charlemagne had become master of an empire which stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Hungarian Plain, and Offa and then Coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison.|$|E
5|$|Girls had equal {{inheritance}} {{rights with}} boys if their father died without leaving a will. A Roman mother's {{right to own}} property and to dispose of it as she saw fit, including setting the terms of her own will, gave her <b>enormous</b> influence over her sons even when they were adults.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate the}} extent to which Geneva was a theocracy. On the one hand, Calvin's {{theology}} clearly called for separation between church and state. Other historians have stressed the <b>enormous</b> political power wielded on a daily basis by the clerics.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Oliver Butterworth {{authored}} a children's book, The <b>Enormous</b> Egg. The {{book and}} a movie adaptation televised in 1968 by the NBC Children's Theatre {{tell the story of}} a boy who finds an <b>enormous</b> egg laid by a hen that hatches a baby Triceratops. The dinosaur, named Uncle Beazley, becomes too big, so the boy brings him to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Beazley is first kept at National Museum of Natural History, but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo's Elephant House because there is a law against stabling large animals in the District of Columbia.|$|E
5|$|In 2286, an <b>enormous</b> {{cylindrical}} probe {{moves through}} space, sending out an indecipherable signal and disabling {{the power of}} ships it passes. As it takes up orbit around Earth, its signal disables the global power grid and generates planetary storms, creating catastrophic, sun-blocking cloud cover. Starfleet Command sends out a planetary distress call and warns starships not to approach Earth.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, some pure-blooded desert-bred Arabians in Syria had <b>enormous</b> {{difficulties}} {{being accepted}} as registrable purebred Arabians {{because many of}} the Bedouin who owned them saw no need to obtain a piece of paper to verify the purity of their horses. However, eventually the Syrians developed a stud book for their animals that was accepted by the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Riley-Smith {{considers}} {{that much of}} the popular understanding of the Crusades derives from the novels of Walter Scott and the French histories by Joseph François Michaud. The Crusades provided an <b>enormous</b> amount of source material, stories of heroism, and interest that underpinned growth in medieval literature, romance, and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet {{and two of}} his divisions—-those {{commanded}} by Pickett and John Bell Hood—-were detached from Lee's main army in April while participating in the Suffolk Campaign. They thus missed the Battle of Chancellorsville. The Suffolk Campaign was minor and inconclusive, while the Battle of Chancellorsville was an <b>enormous</b> Confederate victory.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn was a {{fine and}} {{enthusiastic}} artist in pencil and watercolour, a skill which he used throughout his life for his own amusement {{and that of his}} friends. His <b>enormous</b> correspondence shows that he could also be a witty writer in German and English– sometimes accompanied by humorous sketches and cartoons in the text.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{the summits}} {{that make up}} the Metacomet Ridge, West Rock, in New Haven, Connecticut, bears special mention because it was not formed by the {{volcanic}} flooding that created most of the traprock ridges. Rather, it is the remains of an <b>enormous</b> volcanic dike through which the basalt lava floods found access to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Pathan {{was then}} {{selected}} for the India Under-15 team in mid-2000 to play a series of matches against their colleagues from other countries. He took 15 wickets at 12.66 in ten matches, including a best of 3/2 against Thailand, and scored 15 runs at 7.50. India won {{all but one of}} the matches, most by <b>enormous</b> margins.|$|E
5|$|Problems with moving {{dunes and}} {{desertification}} were subsequently {{brought under control}} in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries by establishing large plantations of grasses, bushes and fir trees. Two significant migratory dunes remain in the area, {{one of which is}} the <b>enormous</b> Råbjerg Mile.|$|E
5|$|September 4, 1917 – <b>Enormous</b> {{waves and}} {{extremely}} high tides {{from a major}} hurricane to the east inundate low-lying areas, including the entirety of Market Square in St. George's; individuals at Town Hall become stranded by the rising waters. A large section of Higgs' Island is swept away.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj was a {{sizeable}} city {{with the principal}} architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an <b>enormous</b> investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments.|$|E
5|$|The An Lushan Rebellion {{began in}} December 755, {{and was not}} {{completely}} suppressed for almost eight years. It caused <b>enormous</b> disruption to Chinese society: the census of 754 recorded 52.9 million people, but ten years later, the census counted just 16.9 million, the remainder having been displaced or killed.|$|E
5|$|The BBC granted {{licences}} to a {{small number}} of British firms, who first manufactured the product in 1975. The product underwent a change in 1987 due to consistency issues in manufacturing, and again in around 2003 when original parts from KEF ran out. Upwards of 60,000 pairs of the speaker have been sold. Reviewers have recognised its <b>enormous</b> importance as a bookshelf design.|$|E
