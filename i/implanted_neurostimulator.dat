40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} {{has become}} an increasingly common treatment for Parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders. Consequently, {{it is important to}} understand the concepts of appropriate patient selection, the implantation process, and the various drugs and techniques that can be used to facilitate this treatment. Currently, none of the anaesthetic techniques for neurostimulator implantation has proven to be superior to others, although awake or sedation techniques are popular as they facilitate intraoperative neurological testing. However, even with meticulous anaesthetic care, perioperative complications such as hypertension and seizures do occasionally occur and close monitoring is required. Anaesthesia in patients with an <b>implanted</b> <b>neurostimulator</b> requires special considerations because of possible interference between neurostimulators and other devices. We have reviewed the current knowledge of anaesthetic techniques and perioperative complications of neurostimulator insertion. Anaesthetic consider-ations in patients with an <b>implanted</b> <b>neurostimulator</b> are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNeurostimulation is an {{emerging}} treatment for drug-resistant epilepsies when surgery is contraindicated. Recent clinical results demonstrate significant seizure frequency reduction in epileptic patients, however the mechanisms underlying this therapeutic effect are largely unknown. This study aimed at gaining insights into local direct current stimulation (LDCS) effects on hyperexcitable tissue, by i) analyzing {{the impact of}} electrical currents locally applied on epileptogenic brain regions, and ii) characterizing currents achieving an "anti-epileptic" effect (excitability reduction). First, a neural mass model of hippocampal circuits was extended to accurately reproduce the features of hippocampal paroxysmal discharges (HPD) observed in a mouse model of epilepsy. Second, model predictions regarding current intensity and stimulation polarity were confronted to in vivo mice recordings during LDCS (n = 8). The neural mass model was able to generate realistic hippocampal discharges. Simulation of LDCS in the model pointed at a significant decrease of simulated HPD (in duration and occurrence rate, not in amplitude) for cathodal stimulation, which was successfully verified experimentally in epileptic mice. Despite the simplicity of our stimulation protocol, these results contribute {{to a better understanding}} of clinical benefits observed in epileptic patients with <b>implanted</b> <b>neurostimulators.</b> Our results also provide further support for model-guided design of neuromodulation therapy...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECT: The aim of {{this study}} was to study the effects of MR imaging on the {{electrical}} settings of deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems and their clinical consequences. METHODS: The authors studied the effects of 1. 5 -T MR imaging on the electrical settings of implanted DBS systems, including 1 or more monopolar or quadripolar leads, extension leads, and single- or dual-channel implantable pulse generators (IPGs). The IPG was switched off during the procedure and the voltage was set to 0. The impedances were checked before and after MR imaging. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy patients were treated with DBS for movement disorders and underwent brain MR imaging after lead implantation and before IPG implantation. None of the patients experienced any adverse events. Thirty-one of these patients underwent 61 additional MR imaging sessions after the entire DBS system had been implanted. The authors report neither local cutaneous nor neurological disorders during or after the MR imaging session. No change in the IPG settings occurred when the magnet reed switch function remained disabled during the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that 1. 5 -T MR imaging can be performed safely with continuous monitoring in patients with a DBS system. The ability to disable the magnet reed switch function of the IPG prevents any change in the electrical settings and thus any side effects. The increasing number of DBS indications and the widespread use of MR imaging indicates the need for defining safety guidelines for the use of MR imaging in patients with <b>implanted</b> <b>neurostimulators...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patients with {{suspected}} mesial {{temporal lobe}} (MTL) epilepsy typically undergo inpatient video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring with scalp and/or intracranial electrodes for 1 to 2 weeks to localize and lateralize the seizure focus or foci. Chronic ambulatory electrocorticography (ECoG) {{in patients with}} MTL epilepsy may provide additional information about seizure lateralization. This analysis describes data obtained from chronic ambulatory ECoG in patients with suspected bilateral MTL epilepsy {{in order to assess}} the time required to determine the seizure lateralization and whether this information could influence treatment decisions. METHODS: Ambulatory ECoG was reviewed in patients with suspected bilateral MTL epilepsy who were among a larger cohort with intractable epilepsy participating in a randomized controlled trial of responsive neurostimulation. Subjects were implanted with bilateral MTL leads and a cranially <b>implanted</b> <b>neurostimulator</b> programmed to detect abnormal interictal and ictal ECoG activity. ECoG data stored by the neurostimulator were reviewed to determine the lateralization of electrographic seizures and the interval of time until independent bilateral MTL electrographic seizures were recorded. RESULTS: Eighty-two subjects were implanted with bilateral MTL leads and followed for 4. 7 years on average (median 4. 9 years). Independent bilateral MTL electrographic seizures were recorded in 84 %. The average time to record bilateral electrographic seizures in the ambulatory setting was 41. 6 days (median 13 days, range 0 - 376 days). Sixteen percent had only unilateral electrographic seizures after an average of 4. 6 years of recording. SIGNIFICANCE: About one third of the subjects implanted with bilateral MTL electrodes required > 1 month of chronic ambulatory ECoG before the first contralateral MTL electrographic seizure was recorded. Some patients with suspected bilateral MTL seizures had only unilateral electrographic seizures. Chronic ambulatory ECoG in patients with suspected bilateral MTL seizures provides data in a naturalistic setting, may complement data from inpatient video-EEG monitoring, and can contribute to treatment decisions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Implanted</b> <b>neurostimulators</b> are {{commonly}} used to activate peripheral nerves or brain cells through one or more electrodes. Because of the variable conditions, the stimulation parameters required to obtain the seeked effect vary from subject to subject {{and from time to}} time in the same subject. Sensing the evoked compound action potential is therefore an important aspect of neural stimulation. However, physiological signals are typically in the mu V to mV range and generated at a short distance from stimulating pulses with magnitudes 3 to 6 orders larger. Anatomical and surgical constraints typically do not allow the stimulation and recording location to be separated by large distances. There is a pressing demand to combine both features in a single electrode. Avoiding a prolonged amplifier saturation induced by the huge stimulation artefact becomes a major challenge. Because of the geometrical proximity between the electrode contacts, the response to be recorded is often expected to emerge within no more than one ms after the stimulus, putting even more emphasis on the required fast amplifier recovery. A last challenge is the fact that the stimulator and recording electronics must be integrated to reduce the size of an implant. The galvanic insulation usually exploited to further reduce stimulation artefacts cannot be applied here. In this paper, we describe a recording circuit sharing common power supplies with a neuro-stimulator. The circuit features an specific artefact suppression system based on highpass filter switching and ac coupling. It is further completed with digital filtering and noise rejection algorithms including the possibility to average responses to repeated stimuli in order to improve signal to noise ratio when necessary. Satisfactory results have been obtained in vivo on rat vagus nerves using a single cuff electrode with adequate organization of the stimulation and recording contacts. The recordings allow neural response thresholds measurements to be performed in vivo. Anglai...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the last}} decade, {{the number of}} <b>neurostimulator</b> systems <b>implanted</b> in {{patients}} has been rapidly growing. Nearly 50, 000 <b>neurostimulators</b> are <b>implanted</b> worldwide annually. The {{most common type of}} implantable neurostimulators is indicated for pain relief. At the same time, commercial use of other electromagnetic technologies is expanding, making electromagnetic interference (EMI) of neurostimulator function an issue of concern. Typically reported sources of neurostimulator EMI include security systems, metal detectors and wireless equipment. When near such sources, patients with <b>implanted</b> <b>neurostimulators</b> have reported adverse events such as shock, pain, and increased stimulation. In recent in vitro studies, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has been shown to inhibit the stimulation pulse of an implantable neurostimulator system during low frequency exposure at close distances. This could potentially be due to induced electrical currents inside the implantable neurostimulator leads that are caused by magnetic field coupling from the low frequency identification system. Methods To systematically address the concerns posed by EMI, we developed a test platform to assess the interference from coupled magnetic fields on implantable neurostimulator systems. To measure interference, we recorded the output of one implantable neurostimulator, programmed for best therapy threshold settings, when in close proximity to an operating low frequency RFID emitter. The output contained electrical potentials from the neurostimulator system and those induced by EMI from the RFID emitter. We also recorded the output of the same neurostimulator system programmed for best therapy threshold settings without RFID interference. Using the Spatially Extended Nonlinear Node (SENN) model, we compared threshold factors of spinal cord fiber excitation for both recorded outputs. Results The electric current induced by low frequency RFID emitter was not significant to have a noticeable effect on electrical stimulation. Conclusions We demonstrated a method for analyzing effects of coupled magnetic field interference on implantable neurostimulator system and its electrodes which could be used by device manufacturers during the design and testing phases of the development process. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background—We {{hypothesize that}} {{left-sided}} low-level vagus nerve stimulation (LL-VNS) can suppress sympathetic outflow and reduce atrial tachyarrhythmias in ambulatory dogs. Methods and Results—We <b>implanted</b> a <b>neurostimulator</b> in 12 dogs {{to stimulate the}} left cervical vagus nerve and a radiotransmitter for continuous recording of left stellate ganglion nerve activity, vagal nerve activities, and ECGs. Group 1 dogs (N 6) underwent 1 week of continuous LL-VNS. Group 2 dogs (N 6) underwent intermittent rapid atrial pacing followed by active or sham LL-VNS on alternate weeks. Integrated stellate ganglion nerve activity was significantly reduced during LL-VNS (7. 8 mV/s; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 6. 94 to 8. 66 versus 9. 4 mV/s [95 % CI, 8. 5 to 10. 3] at baseline; P 0. 033) in group 1. The reduction was most apparent at 8 AM, along with a significantly reduced heart rate (P 0. 008). Left-sided low-level vagus nerve stimulation did not change vagal nerve activity.

40|$|This {{research}} explores {{methods of}} accurately measuring DC current flowing in a circuit sub-block or an entire chip. The major application demonstrated {{is a novel}} mixed-signal system to monitor DC current imbalance on the supply/ground lines of the stimulation circuitry in a <b>neurostimulator</b> <b>implant</b> chip, which indicates a fault {{that may lead to}} dangerous levels of DC current leaking into tissue. The system can detect all known failure modes that cause leakage current including ESD damage, fluid leaks and electrode/PCB/component shorts. Furthermore, the system is agnostic of {{the inner workings of the}} stimulation circuitry it monitors, and can be applied to highly complex implants containing any number of electrodes, without having to scale circuit area and power. The system is sensitive to DC current imbalances 50 - 56 dB smaller than the full-scale current, programmable in the range 0. 25 - 8 mA, yielding an absolute detection sensitivity of 0. 75 - 12 uA; sufficient to make it useful in current and future implants. Static and dynamic power consumption of the system in a typical implant scenario with 10 V stimulation supply are 0. 22 - 0. 49 mW and 0. 64 - 1. 17 mW respectively, while the supply/ground current sensors consume a total of up to 1 V of stimulation voltage headroom. The trade-off between sensitivity and headroom loss can be programmed digitally, as can all other aspects of the system. Practical guidelines on integrating the system into real implant systems are given. The system was developed and tested on a mainstream 0. 35 um CMOS process, with care taken to ensure mass-producibility. An essential part of this was the development of 2 - 3 ns latency HV digital level-shifters that outperform all prior designs. The supply/ground current sensor itself performed up to 22 dB better than comparable prior art. The level-shifter and the sensor have general applicability to many systems beyond <b>neurostimulator</b> <b>implants...</b>|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Urodynamic {{parameters}} that {{predict the}} outcome of sacral nerve stimulation are difficult to define. We studied the predictive value of urethral instability and other urodynamic parameters on the efficacy of sacral nerve stimulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with refractory voiding disorders were <b>implanted</b> with a <b>neurostimulator</b> after responding with more than 50 % improvement in main symptoms after percutaneous nerve evaluation. Filling cystometry was performed with 3 urethral sensors and 1 bladder sensor at baseline and 6 months after implantation. Urethral pressure variations more than 15 cm H(2) O were considered pathological and defined as urethral instability. Clinical efficacy was evaluated by voiding diary data and defined as successful when greater than 50 % improvement was observed. RESULTS: A total of 19 female patients enrolled in the study. At baseline detrusor overactivity was observed in 9 patients, while 18 showed urethral instability. Sacral nerve stimulation therapy was successful in 13 patients (68 %). The number of pads used per day and the severity of leakage decreased significantly. Of the 13 successfully treated patients 12 showed urethral instability at baseline. Detrusor overactivity was present in 4 successfully treated patients. Urethral instability disappeared in 7 of the 13 successfully treated patients and detrusor overactivity disappeared in only 1 of these patients.

40|$|Vagus nerve {{stimulation}} (VNS) {{represents one of}} the main surgical options for the treatment of the refractory epilepsy in pediatric and adult patients. There are several mechanism involved in vagal {{nerve stimulation}} which could influence the pathophysiology of seizures like neuromodulation of the thalamic and subthalamic nuclei involved in seizure initiation and the modulation of the neurotransmitters pattern norepinefrin, GABA, and serotonin. The VNS system is composed of the implanted components (the generator, the lead with the electrodes attached) and the programming system components (programming wand and handheld computer). The authors present their experience with 81 patients diagnosed with refractory epilepsy, investigated, selected and <b>implanted</b> with vagal <b>neurostimulators</b> between December 2012 and January 2015 in Neurosurgery Clinic, "Bagdasar-Arseni" Emergency Hospital.

40|$|Migraine {{attacks are}} {{believed}} to involve activation of the trigeminovascular system and trigeminal-parasympathetic reflex, which is mediated through the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG). An implantable SPG neurostimulator has been developed to apply on-demand SPG stimulation {{for the treatment of}} severe primary headache. The <b>neurostimulator</b> is <b>implanted</b> via an oral incision and placed along the maxilla, with the lead placed at the SPG. The neurostimulator contains no battery and is powered and controlled via a handheld remote controller. The potential interest of patients with high-frequency, high-disability migraine in having a SPG <b>neurostimulator</b> <b>implanted</b> to treat migraine is unknown. We aimed to evaluate patient interest to undergo such an implantation procedure and to participate in a clinical investigation of on-demand SPG stimulation for migraine by conducting a survey at the Ghent University Hospital in 41 migraineurs.

40|$|Background Drug-resistant chronic duster {{headache}} (drCCH) is {{a devastating}} disorder for which various destructive procedures {{have been tried}} unsuccessfully. Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) is a new, safe strategy for intractable headaches. We undertook a prospective pilot trial of ONS in drCCH to assess clinical efficacy and pain perception. Methods Eight patients with drCCH had a suboccipital <b>neurostimulator</b> <b>implanted</b> {{on the side of}} the headache and were asked to record details of frequency, intensity, and symptomatic treatment for their attacks in a diary before and after Continuous ONS. To detect changes in cephalic and extracephalic pain processing we measured electrical and pressure pain thresholds and the nociceptive blink reflex. Findings Two patients were pain free after a follow-up of 16 and 22 months; one of them still had occasional autonomic attacks. Three patients had around a 90 % reduction in attack frequency. Two patients, one of whom had had the implant for only 3 months, had improvement of around 40 %. Mean follow-up was 15. 1 months (SD 9. 5, range 3 - 22). Intensity of attacks tends to decrease earlier than frequency during ONS and, on average, is improved by 50 % in remaining attacks. All but one patient were able to substantially reduce their preventive drug treatment. Interruption of ONS by switching off the stimulator or because of an empty battery was followed within days by recurrence and increase of attacks in all improved patients. ONS did not significantly modify pain thresholds. The amplitude of the nociceptive blink reflex increased with longer durations of ONS. There were no serious adverse events. Interpretation ONS could be an efficient treatment for drCCH and could be safer than deep hypothalamic stimulation. The delay of 2 months or more between implantation and significant clinical improvement suggests that the procedure ads via slow neuromodulatory processes at the level of upper brain stem or diencephalic centres.

40|$|TOPIC: This study {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} chronic endocardial parasympathetic neural stimulation for dynamic ventricular rate control during atrial fibrillation {{and the development of}} an implantable neurostimulator with transvenuous intracardiac lead fixation and evaluation of its long-term efficacy. BACKGROUND: Efficient pharmacological ventricular rate control in patients with chronic permanent atrial fibrillation is not always easy to achieve and limited by potential side effects such as hypotension or bradycardia. Previous studys have shown, that the inferior interatrial ganglionated plexus (IAGP) selectively innervates the AV node. Temporary electrical stimulation of this plexus elicits a reduction of ventricular heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS: In 10 mongrel dogs, the small endocardial area in the right atrium overlying the IAGP was identified by neuromapping with probatory high-frequency stimulation (20 Hz) by using a custom-made positioning catheter with a distal pair of electrodes. After identification of the stimulation area, an active-fixation pacemaker lead was advanced through the inner lumen of the positioning catheter while leaving the catheter in the target area. After transvenuous lead fixation, the positioning catheter was slit and removed and the lead was connected with an implantable neurostimulator. An additional conventional DDD-pacemaker was implanted for initial induction of atrial fibrillation by high-frequency atrial stimulation (600 ppm) and for measurement of ventricular heart rate. In the first study group (n= 5) long-term lead stability was examined by weekly-intermittent neurostimulation. In the second study group (n= 4) continuous neurostimulation was performed during a period of 1 – 2 years for reduction of ventricular rate in a range of 100 – 140 bpm. RESULTS: Implantation of the neurostimulation lead was achieved in 37 ± 12 min. Neurostimulation resulted in a reversible negative dromotropic effect. The on-/offset of the negative dromotropic effect was sudden within 1 second after the initiation or termination of parasympathetic neurostimulation. The major determinants of neurostimulation efficacy were stimulation frequency, voltage and impulse duration. The required voltage for a reduction of the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation of about 40 % was less than 5 V with a chronaxie time of 0. 07 ± 0, 02 ms for a 50 % reduction in ventricular rate. In the first study group (n = 5) weekly-intermittent neurostimulation was effective and well tolerated by the animals during a 6 month follow-up. In the second study group (n = 4) continuous neurostimulation adjusted to achieve a mean ventricular rate decrease during atrial fibrillation of about 40 % was effective during a 1 - 2 years follow-up. CONCLUSION: Continuous parasympathetic stimulation via a cardiac <b>neurostimulator</b> <b>implanted</b> by transvenuous lead fixation and without the need of thoracotomy is possible and provides effective ventricular heart rate control during long-term follow-up. AV node selectivity and the possibility of a dynamic adjustment of the negative dromotropic effect within seconds may be an advantage over pharmacological rate control...|$|R
