25|$|There is some {{difficulty}} over the correct {{name of the}} capital. Early despatches contain reference to both Port Stanley and Stanley. Port Stanley was accepted by the Naming Commission set up in 1943 to consider the names then being included on the War Office maps. Local opinion differs on the matter, {{but there is no}} doubt that Stanley is now common usage and has been for some considerable time. The capital is defined as Stanley in the Interpretation and General Law Ordinance. In the circumstances <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>advise</b> that the correct name for the capital is Stanley.|$|E

500|$|In a 1920 essay, {{after the}} World War I, Gandhi wrote, [...] "where {{there is only}} a choice between cowardice and violence, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>advise</b> violence." [...] Rahul Sagar interprets Gandhi's efforts to recruit for the British {{military}} during the War, as Gandhi's belief that, at that time, it would demonstrate that Indians were willing to fight. Further, it would also show the British that his fellow Indians were [...] "their subjects by choice rather than out of cowardice." [...] In 1922, Gandhi wrote that abstinence from violence is effective and true forgiveness only when one has the power to punish, not when one decides not to do anything because one is helpless.|$|E

She wrote about the ideal qualities found in an actress, and what girls might do to develop them. She received a torrent of letters from readers—many were from girls asking [...] "Must I be able to ride" [...] and [...] "Must I be able to swim". In response, Michelena described in the column how those skills were helpful to a movie actress, but not absolutely necessary; she said they [...] "are accessories to, rather than {{the substance of the}} thing... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>advise</b> every girl entering motion pictures to learn to ride and swim and do all the rest of it, but I would have her realize their subordination to the really artistic side of the profession." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clarke advised Madeleine Albright {{during the}} Genocide in Rwanda, to request the UN to {{withdraw}} all UN troops from Rwanda. She refused, but permitted General Dallaire {{to keep a}} few hundred troops who managed to save thousands from the genocide.

2500|$|On 3 August 2009, RIA Novosti {{published}} {{an interview with}} South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity. Kokoity said that he ruled out a new [...] "Georgian aggression". He said he would demand ceding of the Truso Gorge (part of the Georgian administrative unit of Mtskheta-Mtianeti) to South Ossetia. He also talked about Georgian president Saakashvili: [...] "As for that lover of wars and bellicose slogans, that international criminal, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>advise</b> him to be careful.

2500|$|The {{statements}} sparked {{public outrage}} in Georgia, and Kovalenko was summoned by Georgia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for explanations while the opposition factions in the Parliament of Georgia demanded {{the withdrawal of}} Kovalenko from Georgia. Georgian Parliamentary Chairperson, Nino Burjanadze, responded to the ambassador’s prediction: [...] "Maybe, certain forces in Russia {{really want to see}} the extinction of Georgian nation, but this will not happen... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>advise</b> Mr. Kovalenko to think about Russia and its demographic problems and we will ourselves take care of Georgian problems, including the demographic ones." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gandhi {{rejected}} the idea that injustice should, or even could, be fought against “by any means necessary”– if you use violent, coercive, unjust means, whatever ends you produce will necessarily embed that injustice. To those who preached violence and called nonviolent actionists cowards, he replied: “I do believe that, where {{there is only a}} choice between cowardice and violence, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>advise</b> violence....I would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honour than that she should, in a cowardly manner, become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonour....But I believe that nonviolence is infinitely superior to violence, forgiveness is more manly than punishment.” ...|$|E
