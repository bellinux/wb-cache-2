5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E
5|$|Billy Talent II hit {{the shelves}} on June 27, 2006. It fared {{very well in}} Canada in its debut week, landing in at number 1 on the Canadian charts. It also enjoyed {{significant}} success in Germany, where it also debuted at number 1 in the album charts in its debut week, {{and was one of}} the top 10 selling albums in the country. As of June 15, 2007, the album has sold almost 700,000 units worldwide, 215,000 of them in Canada making it certified 2x Platinum, and 200,000 shipped units in Germany achieved it platinum status there. However, the success did not duplicate itself in the U.S. The band has expressed that they <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a new band there, and they are choosing to concentrate their attention on Canada, Europe, and other places overseas instead.|$|E

Scully is in disbelief until Mulder proves his point by {{shooting}} Skinner in the chest; the yellow substance oozes out of the bullet wounds. Once again, their surroundings melt away as they awaken underground again in the cave. Mulder sticks his hand through the earth ceiling as Skinner {{and a team of}} rescue staff manage to locate them and drag them out and haul them to the safety of an ambulance. Once inside the ambulance, Mulder and Scully weakly hold hands.|$|E

25|$|Just as Jane Goodall studied {{chimpanzee}} {{social and}} family life by careful observation of chimpanzee behavior in the field, psychologists conduct naturalistic observation of ongoing human social, professional, {{and family life}}. Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed, and other times the participants do not <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> being observed. Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out.|$|E

Many crack addicts get no medical care at all and have extremely poor diets, and children who live around crack smoking are at risk of inhaling secondary smoke. Cocaine using mothers also have a higher rate of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV and hepatitis.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} be {{knowledgeable}} contributors, children {{must be aware of}} their surroundings and community's goals. Children's learning in Indigenous-heritage communities is mainly based upon observing and helping out others in their community. Through this type of participation within their community, they gain purpose and motivation for the activity that they are doing within their community and become active participants because they <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> doing it for their community.|$|E
25|$|When {{intermediates}} lay eggs, {{their eggs}} are often eaten by the egg laying wasp herself. This {{is known as}} oophagy. This may occur because this practice increases energy circulation. These wasps {{may not be able}} to store protein well, so they consume their own eggs, reintroducing the protein into their bodies. This supports the idea that queens do in fact control reproduction in the colonies. Intermediates <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not in charge, so they consume their own eggs.|$|E
25|$|Folic acid food {{fortification}} became mandatory in Canada in 1998, with the fortification of 150µg of folic acid per 100grams of enriched flour and uncooked cereal grains. The purpose of fortification was {{to decrease the}} risk of neural tube defects in newborns. It is important to fortify grains {{because it is a}} widely eaten food and the neural tube closes in the first four weeks of gestation, often before many women even <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> pregnant.|$|E

25|$|Planetary nebulae are {{generally}} faint objects, and none are {{visible to the}} naked eye. The first planetary nebula discovered was the Dumbbell Nebula in the constellation of Vulpecula, observed by Charles Messier in 1764 and listed as M27 in his catalogue of nebulous objects. To early observers with low-resolution telescopes, M27 and subsequently discovered planetary nebulae somewhat resembled the gas giants, and William Herschel, discoverer of Uranus, eventually coined the term 'planetary nebula' for them, although, as we now <b>know,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> very different from planets.|$|E
25|$|Starting in January 2016, Austrian {{police forces}} will be trialling the use of body cameras, which {{will be used to}} film their {{interactions}} with civilians. The hope is that this will make the prosecution of any officers who are excessively violent or forceful a lot easier as there will be solid evidence, and also that it will deter officers from behaving violently in the first place, as they will <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> being monitored. It is unsure how long the trial will last, however as of July 2016 it is still ongoing.|$|E

Due to their chief purpose as a neutral presence here, they are not allowed to marry Singaporean women, hence the allowance to bring their wives and children from Nepal to the camp. At the end of their contract, they are expected to return to their villages and back to a rural life dependent on agriculture. Only a handful have ever been known to have broken this tradition and chosen to stay in the city-state.|$|E
500|$|Jim Reid's piece {{appeared}} in The Observer on 25 September 1994. This is [...] "one {{of the most}} peculiar stories of the year", he cautioned readers. [...] "Peculiar because pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine {{is going to have}} trouble believing a word of it. Peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is the truth." [...] "It took about two hours for that cash to go up in flames", he added. [...] "I looked at it closely, it was real. It came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More importantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation I <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> capable of this." ...|$|E

We don’t have the same training facilities, theirs is better than ours. I <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> determined to win but we are also equally determined." [...] She competed in the sixth heat of the 400 metres competition on 13 August; she came in last place with a time of 1:10:14, over 18 seconds behind the heat's winner Salwa Eid Naser of Bahrain.|$|E
