5|$|At about 7:30 PM Khartoum time (17:30 GMT), two American {{warships}} in the Red Sea fired thirteen {{missiles at}} Sudan's Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, which the U.S. claimed was helping bin Laden build chemical weapons. The entire factory was destroyed {{except for the}} administration, water-cooling, and plant laboratory sections, which were severely damaged. One night watchman was killed and ten other Sudanese were wounded by the strike. Worried about the possibility for <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> leakages, analysts ran computer simulations on wind patterns, climate, and chemical data, which indicated a low risk of collateral damage. Regardless, planners added more cruise missiles to the strike on Al-Shifa, aiming to completely destroy the plant and any dangerous substances.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015 two No. 38 Squadron King Airs were {{deployed}} to Vanuatu {{as part of}} Australia's aid effort following Cyclone Pam. The aircraft were used to conduct flights over the affected areas to assess {{the extent of the}} damage, and also evacuated Australian and New Zealand citizens. In February 2016 it was reported that the RAAF was considering consolidating its two squadrons equipped with King Airs into a single squadron located at RAAF Base East Sale. All of the RAAF's King Airs were grounded from 30 June 2016 after the <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> strontium chromate was detected in the aircraft; in the period immediately before the grounding No. 38 Squadron had been involved in flying politicians during the 2016 federal election. The King Airs began to return to service on 4 August that year after being cleaned. As part of its budget for the 2016-17 financial year, the Australian Government announced that Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance, Electronic Warfare equipment would be acquired for three of No. 38 Squadron's King Airs. This equipment will comprise roll-on/roll-off kits, and will be delivered during the financial year.|$|E

25|$|The Disaster Research Center, or DRC, was {{the first}} social science {{research}} center in the world devoted {{to the study of}} disasters. It was established at Ohio State University in 1963 and moved to the University of Delaware in 1985. The Center conducts field and survey research on group, organizational and community preparation for, response to, and recovery from natural and technological disasters and other community-wide crises. DRC researchers have carried out systematic studies on a broad range of disaster types, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> incidents, and plane crashes. DRC has also done research on civil disturbances and riots, including the 1992 Los Angeles unrest. Staff have conducted nearly 700 field studies since the Center's inception, traveling to communities throughout the United States and internationally, including Mexico, Canada, Japan, Italy, and Turkey. Core faculty members are from the Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and the School of Public Policy and Administration. The staff also includes postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduates and research support personnel.|$|E

50|$|Substitution of <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemicals</b> in {{the working}} {{environment}} is a method to a fundamental and continued improvement of occupational health by selection and development of alternative technical processes using less <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemicals</b> or no chemicals at all. In a substitution the chemicals in the final situation must be potentially less hazardous than in the initial situation, and the difference should be as great as possible. It is especially important to avoid chemicals with long-term effects of a carcinogenic, reprotoxic, allergenic, or neurotoxic nature.Less <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemicals</b> are not necessarily harmless, so the traditional preventive measures may {{still have to be}} used, but the substitution has reduced the level of hazards.Successful substitution may, however, require technical and organizational changes.Substitution cuts the cycle of <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemicals</b> - also in the environment.

2500|$|On {{the night}} of July 14, 1991, a Southern Pacific train derailed into the upper Sacramento River at a sharp bend of track known as the Cantara Loop, {{upstream}} from Dunsmuir, California, in Siskiyou County. Several cars made contact with the water, including a tank car. Early {{in the morning of}} 15 July, it became apparent that the tank car had ruptured and spilled its entire contents into the river – approximately 19,000 gallons of a soil fumigant – metam sodium. Ultimately, over a million fish, {{and tens of thousands of}} amphibians and crayfish were killed. Millions of aquatic invertebrates, including insects and mollusks, which form the basis of the river's ecosystem, were destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of willows, alders, and cottonwoods eventually died. Many more were severely injured. The chemical plume left a 41-mile wake of destruction, from the spill site to the entry point of the river into Shasta Lake. The accident still ranks as the largest <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> spill in California history. This substance was not classified as a hazardous material at the time of the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Type B1 and B2 {{cabinets}} have {{a minimum}} inflow velocity of 100ft/min, and these cabinets must be hard-ducted to an exhaust system rather than exhausted through a thimble connection. Their exhaust systems must also be dedicated (one BSC per duct run, per blower). In contrast to the type A1 and A2 cabinets, Type B BSCs use single pass airflow (air that does not mix and recirculate) in order to also control <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> vapors. Type B1 cabinets split the airflow so that the air behind the smoke-split is directed to the exhaust system, while air between the operator and the smoke-split mixes with inflow air and is recirculated as downflow. Since exhaust air is drawn from the rear grille, the CDC advises that work with hazardous chemistry be conducted {{in the rear of}} the cabinet. This is complicated, since the smoke split (demarking the [...] "rear of the cabinet") is an invisible line that extends the width of the cabinet (approximately 10-14 inches from the front grille) and drifts as the internal HEPA filters load with particulate.|$|E

Titan Salvage assembled a salvage team consisting of the following companies: Harbor Star, a Philippine tug and salvage company; Global Diving & Salvage, a U.S. based diving company specializing in hazardous diving operations; and South Pacific Environmental, a Guam-based company specializing in <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> mitigation. The salvage team began the actual endosulfan recovery operations on September 24, 2008, and by October 5, all 402 of the 25kg drums had been safely recovered from the first 40ft container located near the aft end of [...] "D" [...] deck in about 85ft of water. The salvage team then proceeded to remove the other dangerous cargos from a 20ft container located {{toward the center of}} [...] "D" [...] deck in about 35ft of water. On October 11, it was determined that all of the dangerous cargo located in the second container had been safely recovered. The salvage team drilled into the ship's hull to remove the ship's fuel, and this phase was completed by October 17. Approximately 200,000 liters were recovered.|$|E
