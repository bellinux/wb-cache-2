50|$|The Tema Oil Refinery in Ghana {{underwent}} {{the first}} phase of a major rehabilitation in 1989. The second phase began in April 1990 at an estimated cost of CN¥220.8 million or GH₵77.8 million (US$36 million). Once rehabilitation was completed, distribution of liquified petroleum gas was to be improved, and the quantity supplied was to rise from 28,000 to 34,000 barrels per day. Construction on the new Tema-Akosombo oil products pipeline, designed to improve the distribution system further, began in January 1992. The pipeline was to carry refined products from Tema to Akosombo Port, where they will be transported across Lake Volta to northern regions. Distribution continued to be uneven, however. Other measures to improve the situation included a CN¥171.7 million or GH₵60.5 million (US$28 million) project to set up a national network of storage depots in all regions. The Tema Lube Oil Company commissioned its new oil blending plant, designed to produce 25,000 tons of oil per year, in 1992. The plant was to satisfy both North Ghana and Ghana's requirements for motor and <b>gear</b> <b>lubricants</b> and 60% of the country's need for industrial lubricants, or, in all, 90% of Ghana's demand for lubricant products.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. A tribo-dynamics {{model of a}} {{differential}} hypoid gear pair is presented, integrated with lubricated contact of meshing teeth pair with lubricants of varying rheological properties. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the effect of lubricant formulation and gear geometry on the system efficiency. The influence of gear torsional dynamic response is taken into account in a 4 -Degree of Freedom (DoF) model. The contact geometry and kinematics of the hypoid gear pair are estimated, using Tooth Contact Analysis (TCA). Two fully formulated <b>gear</b> <b>lubricants</b> of the same viscosity grade (SAE 75 W- 90) blended with the same additive pack, but with different types and concentration of viscosity modifier (VM) are considered. Conjunctional friction is predicted for viscous shear of fully characterised lubricants as well as boundary interaction of rough surfaces. The results show loss of friction resulting in resonant response of the gear pair with impact of meshing teeth exhibiting non-linear jump phenomenon. The predictions also show that lubricants with higher pressure – viscosity (PV) coefficients tend to exhibit increased power loss...|$|E
40|$|A {{constitutive}} lubricant friction {{model for}} rolling/sliding concentrated contacts such as gears and cams was developed, {{based upon the}} Johnson and Tevaarwerk fluid rheology model developed earlier. The friction model reported herein differs from the earlier rheological models in that very large slide to roll ratios can now be accommodated by modifying the thermal response of the model. Also the elastic response of the fluid has been omitted from the model, thereby making it much simpler {{for use in the}} high slide to roll contacts. The effects of this simplification are very minimal on the outcome of the predicted friction losses (less than 1 %). In essence then the lubricant friction model developed for the high slide to roll ratios treats the fluid in the concentrated contact as consisting of a nonlinear viscous element that is pressure, temperature, and strain rate dependent in its shear response. The fluid rheological constants required for the prediction of the friction losses at different contact conditions are obtained by traction measurements on several of the currently used <b>gear</b> <b>lubricants.</b> An example calculation, using this model and the fluid parameters obtained from the experiments, shows that it correctly predicts trends and magnitude of gear mesh losses measured elsewhere for the same fluids tested here...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{offshore}} wind turbines {{as a source}} of renewable energy is promising. However, many challenges have to be solved before they will be cost effective. The operation time, without any maintenance required, is desired to be as long as possible, because downtime and maintenance costs are high. Thus {{it is important that the}} rotating parts in the turbine have a long operational time. The harsh marine environment, combined with the desire for elongated operating times and little or no maintenance, give rise to many tribological challenges. It is important that the chosen materials and lubricants can withstand the marine environment, and the high loads. The effect of marine environment on lubricating properties of lubricants is not well understood. The objective of this thesis has been to investigate this effect. Two lubricants that are commonly used as <b>gear</b> <b>lubricants</b> in onshore wind turbines were tested in this work; polyalphaolefin and polyalkylene glycol. They were both contaminated with different amounts of artificial seawater in order to investigate the effect on the lubricating properties. The lubricants were tested in a rotating ball-on-disc tribometer, with self-mated stainless steel, and self-mated silicon carbide. Stainless steel was selected as it is commonly used in gear bearings, whereas silicon carbide was chosen due to its promising excellent properties. The results obtained from this work show that PAO has a very low saturation limit for water, and an emulsion will be formed even at low contamination levels. This made the lubricant unstable, and the measured COF were unstable. It was found that the amount of two-body abrasive wear increased as a function of seawater content. The PAG lubricant managed to dissolve much larger quantities of seawater that PAO. But even though the system was one-phased, the results for COF were unstable. Wear induced pitting was found for both clean and contaminated lubricant. It is believed that it is caused by the additive package of the lubricant. For dry tribological testing COF was found to be mush less for self-mated silicon carbide than for self-mated stainless steel. This is as expected, since silicon carbide has shown outstanding tribological properties in previous work. For self-mated silicon carbide testing only abrasive wear could be found for both dry contact, and lubricated. The results from PAO contaminated with seawater, showed a clear increase in COF as a function of seawater content. Further, the COF all stabilized after the running-in period. PAG showed no such trend with increasing amounts of seawater, but the standard deviation of the measurements increased. </p...|$|E

Only high grade engine oil should be used in the engine. Oil of this kind reaches the bearing surfaces with greater east and cuts down frictional heat. It should have sufficient body so that the pressure between the two bearing surfaces will not force out the oil and allow the metal to come in actual contact. Inferior oils have a tendency to carbonize quickly, also "gu m up" the piston rings, valve stems and bearings. In cold weather a light grade of oil having a low cold test is absolutely essential for the proper lubrication of the car. In general an oil having the body S. A.

Three different types of lubricant’s viscosity; VG 100, VG 460 and VG 680 were used in the study to serve the sliding friction of worm gears.

The results revealed that a lubricant with higher viscosity contributes to less vibration amplitude.

In this case, VG 100 showed the highest vibration amplitude followed by VG 460 and VG 680.
