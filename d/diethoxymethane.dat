Experiment results showed that four selected diethers, including 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane, 2, 2 dimethoxypropane, <b>diethoxymethane,</b> and 1, 1 -diethoxyethane, converted a methanol/oil two-phase system into a diether/methanolloil one-phase system when they were added up to a critical volume. There {{were no significant differences}} among these four diethers in forming one-phase system with sunflower oil. The conversion rates using diethers as cosolvents were slightly higher than those using monoethers under the same reaction condition. The optimal catalyst (KOH) concentration of 6. 90 g/L and methanol/oil molar ratio of 9 : 1 were determined when <b>diethoxymethane</b> was used to intensify the transesterification. The higher the reaction temperature (from 25 - 65 degrees C) was, the quicker the transesterification was. It took 7 min to get a 97. 0 % methyl ester concentration at 25 degrees C and only 2 min to reach 96. 7 % at 65 degrees C.

40|$|The {{densities of}} dilute aqueous {{solutions}} of 11 ethers [oxeiane, oxepane, 1, 3 -dioxane, 1, 3 -dioxepane, 1, 3, 5 - trioxane, 2, 4, 6 -trlmethyl- 1, 3, 5 -trioxane (Paraldehyde), 2, 5 - dimethoxytetrahydrofuran, dimethoxymethane, <b>diethoxymethane,</b> 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane, 1, 2 - diethoxyethane] have been determined at 25 O C {{by means of}} a differential buoyancy technique.

40|$|Vapor-liquid equilibria for {{dichloromethane}} or chlorobutane+a linear mono-, or diether (diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, methyl butyl ether, 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane,) or an acetal (<b>diethoxymethane),</b> {{were determined}} at 25 °C by head-space gas chromatographic {{analysis of the}} vapor phase directly withdrawn from an equilibration apparatus. Excess Gibbs energies, GE, activity coefficients at infinite dilution, fi o as well as free energy of solvation, ΔGo, were evaluated for all the systems. A tentative approach is presented based either on an additivity scheme of surface interactions and scaled particle theory to calculate group contribution to the free energy of solvation...|$|E
40|$|Vapor-liquid equilibria for {{tetrachloromethane}} + {{a linear}} mono-, di-, or triether (diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, dibutyl ether, methyl butyl ether, ethyl butyl ether, 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane, 1, 2 -diethoxyethane, di(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether) or an acetal (dimethoxymethane, <b>diethoxymethane)</b> were determined at 298. 15 K by head-space gas chromatographic {{analysis of the}} vapor phase directly withdrawn from an equilibration apparatus. Excess molar Gibbs energies GE for the investigated mixtures were determined by a least-squares treatment of the equilibrium data. The GE values are generally negative and, though small, reflect effects due to (i) chain lengthening, (ii) position of the oxygen atom in the chain structure of monoethers, and (iii) distance of two -O-groups in diethers or acetals...|$|E
40|$|A self-assembled supramolecular host catalyzes the {{hydrolysis}} of acetals {{in basic}} aqueous solution. The mechanism of hydrolysis {{is consistent with}} the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model. Further investigation of the rate limiting step of the reaction revealed a negative entropy of activation ({Delta}S{double_dagger} = - 9 cal mol{sup - 1 }K{sup - 1 }) and an inverse solvent isotope effect (k(H{sub 2 }O) /k(D{sub 2 }O) = 0. 62). These data suggest that the mechanism of hydrolysis that takes place inside the assembly proceeds through an A- 2 mechanism, in contrast to the A- 1 mechanism operating in the uncatalyzed reaction. Comparison of the rates of acetal hydrolysis in the assembly with the rate of the reaction of unencapsulated substrates reveals rate accelerations of up to 980 over the background reaction for the substrate <b>diethoxymethane...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} of paraffin oxidation in intact {{cells of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated. Oxidation of 14 C-heptane by cell-free extracts of adapted cells {{showed that the}} activity of whole cells is a reliable reflection of the synthesis of the first enzyme in the degradation of n-alkanes. Induction was significantly affected by glucose and could be completely repressed by malate. The amino acids l-proline, l-alanine, l-arginine, and l-tyrosine exhibited a rather low repressor action. Malonate, a nonrepressive carbon source, allowed gratuitous enzyme synthesis. A number of compounds which did not sustain growth {{were found to be}} suitable substitutes for paraffins as an inducer. Among these were cyclopropane and <b>diethoxymethane.</b> The induction studied under conditions of gratuity with the latter compound as an inducer showed immediate linear kinetics only at saturating inducer concentrations. With n-hexane as the inducer, a lag time was always observed, even when high concentrations were used...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDisubstituted trialkyloxonium ions R 1 OCH 2 O+(R 1) CH 2 OR 2 (R 1, R 2 = CH 3 or C 2 H 5) {{have been}} {{prepared}} by chemical ionization of dimethoxy- and <b>diethoxymethane</b> individually or as a mixture, and their fragmentation has been studied by means of metastable ion and collision-induced dissociations. It is found that when a methoxymethyl group {{is attached to the}} charged oxygen atom, the oxonium ions can fragment by C–O bond cleavage to generate a methoxymethyl cation/dialkoxymethane ion–neutral complex, in which methyl cation transfer occurs to expel neutral formaldehyde. When an ethoxymethyl group is connected with the central oxygen atom, a reaction channel involving loss of C 2 H 4 O is observed and found to be insensitive to collisions. This process is proposed to involve isomerization prior to fragmentation leading to methylated dialkoxymethanes coordinated with neutral acetaldehyde in ion–neutral complexes; these ion–neutral complexes are estimated to be 35 kJ mol− 1 more stable than the original oxonium ions...|$|E
40|$|A rapid in situ {{transesterification}} {{process of}} sunflower oil with methanol assisted by <b>diethoxymethane</b> (DEM) {{is described in}} this article. DEM served as both extraction solvent and reaction promoter in the process. The effects of moisture content of sunflower seeds, catalyst category, molar ratio of catalyst/oil, molar ratio of methanol/oil, molar ratio of DEM/oil, reaction time, reaction temperature, and agitation speed on the in situ transesterification were investigated. The most important factors which influenced the crude biodiesel yield, free fatty acid (FFA) content, and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) purity were the molar ratio of DEM/oil, molar ratio of catalyst/oil, and molar ratio of catalyst/oil, respectively. An empirical model of the rapid in situ transesterification process was established and {{used to determine the}} optimal reaction conditions. When the in situ transesterification was carried out at the molar ratio of catalyst/oil of 0. 5 : 1, the molar ratio of methanol/oil of 101. 39 : 1, the molar ratio of DEM/oil of 57. 85 : 1, the agitation speed of 150 rpm, and reaction temperature of 20 degrees C, a product containing 97. 7 % FAME and 0. 74 % FFA was obtained within 13 min...|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of dimethoxymethane (DMM or methylal) and <b>diethoxymethane</b> (DEM or ethylal) {{to a rich}} ethylene/oxygen/argon flame has been investigated by measuring the depletion of soot precursors. Three rich premixed ethylene/oxygen/argon (with and without added methylal or ethylal) flat flames have been stabilized at low-pressure (50 mbar) on a Spalding–Botha type burner with the same equivalence ratio of 2. 50. Identification and monitoring of signal intensity profiles of species within the flames {{have been carried out}} by using molecular beam mass spectrometry (M. B. M. S.). The replacement of some C 2 H 4 by C 3 H 8 O 2 or C 5 H 12 O 2 is responsible for a decrease of the maximum mole fractions of the detected intermediate species. This phenomenon is noticeable for C 2 –C 4 intermediates and becomes more effective for C 5 –C 10 species, mainly when C 3 H 8 O 2 added. A new kinetic model has been elaborated and contains 546 reactions and 107 chemical species in order to simulate the three investigated flames: C 2 H 4 /O 2 /Ar, C 2 H 4 /DMM/O 2 /Ar and C 2 H 4 /DEM/O 2 /Ar. The reaction mechanism well reproduces experimental mole fraction profiles of major and intermediate species, and underlines the effect of methylal and ethylal addition on species concentration profiles for these flames...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} of potential age markers of Madeira wine is of paramount significance {{as it may}} contribute to detect frauds and to ensure the authenticity of wine. Considering the chemical groups of furans, lactones, volatile phenols, and acetals, 103 volatile compounds were tentatively identified; among these, 71 have been reported {{for the first time}} in Madeira wines. The chemical groups that could be used as potential age markers were predominantly acetals, namely, <b>diethoxymethane,</b> 1, 1 -diethoxyethane, 1, 1 -diethoxy- 2 -methyl-propane, 1 -(1 -ethoxyethoxy) -pentane, trans-dioxane and 2 -propyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane, and from the other chemical groups, 5 -methylfurfural and cis-oak-lactone, independently of the variety and the type of wine. GC × GC-ToFMS system offers a more useful approach to identify these compounds compared to previous studies using GC−qMS, due to the orthogonal systems, that reduce coelution, increase peak capacity and mass selectivity, contributing to the {{establishment of}} new potential Madeira wine age markers. Remarkable results were also obtained in terms of compound identification based on the organized structure of the peaks of structurally related compounds in the GC × GC peak apex plots. This information represents a valuable approach for future studies, as the ordered-structure principle can considerably help the establishment of the composition of samples. This new approach provides data that can be extended to determine age markers of other types of wines...|$|E
