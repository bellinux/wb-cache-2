25|$|Knowledge Representation (KR) {{research}} involves {{analysis of}} how to reason accurately and effectively {{and how best to}} use a set of symbols to represent a set of facts within a <b>knowledge</b> <b>domain.</b> A symbol vocabulary and a system of logic are combined to enable inferences about elements in the KR to create new KR sentences. Logic is used to supply formal semantics of how reasoning functions should be applied to the symbols in the KR system. Logic is also used to define how operators can process and reshape the knowledge. Examples of operators and operations include, negation, conjunction, adverbs, adjectives, quantifiers and modal operators. The logic is interpretation theory. These elements—symbols, operators, and interpretation theory—are what give sequences of symbols meaning within a KR.|$|E
2500|$|Knowledge {{representation}} and knowledge engineering {{are central to}} AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of [...] "what exists" [...] is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The semantics of these are captured as description logic concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the Web Ontology Language. The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge by acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular <b>knowledge</b> <b>domain</b> (field of interest or area of concern). Such formal knowledge representations are suitable for content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery via automated reasoning (inferring new statements based on explicitly stated knowledge), etc. Video events are often represented as SWRL rules, which can be used, among others, to automatically generate subtitles for constrained videos.|$|E

Such an optimization can significantly affect the work-related {{skills of the}} labor force yielding a better match to the requirements of the jobs, since every occupation requires a different mix of knowledge, skills, and abilities. In this paper, we identify critical competencies for a specific job family by analyzing the characteristics of the jobs-knowledge bipartite weighted network for the 48 jobs and the 33 <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b> comprising the “Life, Physical and Social Sciences ” job family of the O*NET (Occupational Information Network) database, USA's primary source of occupational information.

2500|$|Pedagogical content {{knowledge}} {{is understood as}} the “blending of content and pedagogy” that guides the organization, representation and adaptation of the material for all learners through instruction. This concept goes beyond the consideration of the {{content knowledge}} as isolated from the pedagogical knowledge teachers must possess to effectively cater {{to the needs of}} their students. In order to illustrate how pedagogical content knowledge operates in reference to a specific <b>knowledge</b> <b>domain,</b> we can turn to the field of second language teaching. In this field, pedagogical content knowledge can be considered a “developmental construct” [...] initiated in pre-service teacher education programs and continued through in-service classroom experiences or “knowledge in action”. From this perspective, it is useful to look at the various components. Pedagogical knowledge refers to the different instructional approaches and techniques used to teach languages as well as the consideration of how the linguistic knowledge progresses and grows in complexity along the continuum of a curriculum (i.e., Schulman’s lateral curricular knowledge). This pedagogical knowledge also involves a growing understanding of content choice and pedagogy that views language learning as communication, performance in tasks, student-centered instruction, attention to accuracy and message. On the other hand, if we were to characterize the content knowledge in language teaching, we would be talking about the target language. What it entails for the second language teacher is not only the mastery of the target language but also “discipline-derived understandings from applied linguistics, SLA, psychology and curriculum development, among other areas, in a deeper examination of [...] subject matter -language- as it becomes classroom content”. However, if we are to enhance the definition of the pedagogical content knowledge in second language teaching, we need to include aspects related to language knowledge for teaching by following Schulman’s dimension of “subject matter knowledge for teaching”. These aspects include language teachers’ use of effective ways to represent the various types of knowledge involved in learning a language [...] that include {{but are not limited to}} syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and phonology. Besides it will require teachers to have a wide understanding of their language learners’ characteristics to be able to identify and explore the conceptions and misconceptions and, more importantly, “potential misunderstandings of [...] subject area” [...] these learners bring and/or develop in the learning situation. It also includes ways to help learners overcome these difficulties. For instance, Spanish speakers tend to omit subjects while learning a language with weak nominal features such as English, due to the fact that Spanish is predominantly a null subject language. Therefore, this may turn into a source of overgeneralization while these learners learn the target language. [...] The two main aspects of pedagogical content knowledge presented here correspond to the two domains defined by Ball, Thames and Phelps [...] as knowledge of content and teaching as well as knowledge of content and students respectively. The consideration of all these components constitutes the pedagogical content knowledge language teachers need to possess to become effective practitioners.|$|E

Moreover, the study intends to identify the <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b> {{that are important to}} providing clinical supervision in rehabilitation. In examining the <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b> for clinical supervision in rehabilitation The Rehabilitation Counselor Supervision Inventory (RCSI) was utilized. More than 120 rehabilitation supervisors employed within state-federal vocational rehabilitation field offices, community rehabilitation programs, and centers for independent living in Illinois comprised the sample.

Descriptive statistics were computed on the six clinical supervision <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b> on the RCSI in order to examine the mean and standard deviation for the subjects 2 ̆ 7 responses to the knowledge and skills scale. For the study, the supervisors rated the following clinical supervision <b>knowledge</b> and skills <b>domains</b> in order of importance: ethical and legal issues, rehabilitation counseling knowledge, intervention techniques and models, assessment and evaluation, supervisory relationship, and theories and models.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{pedagogical}} content knowledge {{is integral to}} teaching as a profession and is often {{considered to be an}} important aspect of a teacher's lived experience. Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) is described as a transformation of teacher knowledge from a variety of <b>domains</b> of <b>knowledge,</b> which includes subject matter knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and knowledge about content. This exploratory study reports on in-service natural science teachers' inferences regarding preservice teachers' performance in natural science teaching, as observed during a practice teaching period. Perspectives of in-service teachers of the different <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b> of pre-service teachers during their final year were investigated. Semi-structured interviews, incorporating a specific set of open-ended questions, were conducted with in-service teachers following a practice teaching period of four weeks.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a new concept}} called <b>domain</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{management}} for informationproviding dialogue systems is introduced. <b>Domain</b> <b>knowledge</b> management includes issues related to representation and use of <b>domain</b> <b>knowledge</b> as well as access of background information sources, issues that previously have been incorporated in dialogue management. The work on <b>domain</b> <b>knowledge</b> management reported in this thesis can be divided in two parts. On a general theoretical level, knowledge sources and models used for dialogue management, including <b>domain</b> <b>knowledge</b> management, are studied and related to the capabilities they support. On a more practical level, <b>domain</b> <b>knowledge</b> management is examined in the contexts of a dialogue system framework and a specific instance of this framework, the ÖTRAF system. In this system <b>domain</b> <b>knowledge</b> management is implemented in a separate module, a <b>Domain</b> <b>Knowledge</b> Manager. The use of a specialised <b>Domain</b> <b>Knowledge</b> Manager {{has a number of}} advantages. The first is that dialogue management becomes more focused as it only has to consider dialogue phenomena, while domain-specific reasoning is handled by the <b>Domain</b> <b>Knowledge</b> Manager. Secondly, porting of a system to new domains is facilitated since domain-related issues are separated out in specialised <b>domain</b> <b>knowledge</b> sources.
