40|$|In {{apartment}} buildings with a collective heating system usually a weather compensator {{is used for}} controlling the heat delivery to the various apartments. With this weather compensator the supply water temperature to the apartments is regulated depending on the outside air temperature. With decreasing outside air temperature, the supply water temperature is increased because {{of the increase in}} the heat demand. The relation between the supply water temperature and outside air temperature is called the <b>heating</b> <b>curve.</b> After implementation these heating curves are usually set according to the design of the heating system. Often there is no check whether this setting is indeed correct in practice. Due to safety marges in the design, in practice often a some what lower <b>heating</b> <b>curve</b> is possible. Furthermore in practice adjustments on the heating curves are often used as an easy way to prevent complaints. Heating curves are for instance increased in case of complaints about too low inside air temperatures. The actual cause for the complaints is often not further investigated and the <b>heating</b> <b>curve</b> is often not set back and kept at an unnecessary high level in the future. The result of the above mentioned is that in a lot of situations the setting of the <b>heating</b> <b>curve</b> will not be the optimum for the specific building. This can, amongst other things, lead to thermal discomfort and unnecessary energy consumption. A method for determining the optimum setting of the <b>heating</b> <b>curve</b> in practice is developed by CSTB (France). With this method an easy and rational optimalisation can be obtained. Within the framework of the Sprint program of the European Community, this method is tested and improved by cooperation between CSTB (France), CSTC (Belgium), IBP (Germany), SINTEF (Norway) and TNO (the Netherlands).

40|$|This study {{proposed}} a new binder {{as an alternative}} to conventional cement to reduce the heat of hydration in mass concrete elements. As a main cementitious material, low-heat cement (LHC) was considered, and then fly ash (FA), modified FA (MFA) by vibrator mill, and limestone powder (LP) were used as a partial replacement of LHC. The addition of FA delayed the induction period at the hydration <b>heat</b> <b>curve</b> and the maximum heat flow value (qmax) increased compared with the LHC based binder. As the proportion and fineness of the FA increased, the induction period of the hydration <b>heat</b> <b>curve</b> was extended, and the qmax increased. The hydration production of Ca(OH) 2 was independent of the addition of FA or MFA up to an age of 7 days, beyond which the amount of Ca(OH) 2 gradually decreased owing to their pozzolanic reaction. In the case of LP being used as a supplementary cementitious material, the induction period of the hydration <b>heat</b> <b>curve</b> was reduced by comparison with the case of LHC based binder, and monocarboaluminate was observed as a hydration product.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review and {{classify}} the various patterns of isosteric heat versus loading for adsorption of gases on graphitised thermal carbon black at temperatures ranging from below the 3 D triple point to temperatures above it, {{but less than}} the 3 D critical point. We have identified the features of <b>heat</b> <b>curve</b> and highlighted the microscopic origin of these features. The patterns vary with temperature and with the relative strength of the fluid-fluid interaction and solid-fluid interaction. For simple adsorptives (by simple we meant there is no strong association between fluid particles), the <b>heat</b> <b>curve</b> is typified by fluid-fluid attraction and layering phenomena. For adsorptives showing strong association such as water, ammonia and methanol, the <b>heat</b> <b>curve</b> essentially begins below the condensation heat and then approaches it as loading is increased. This is mainly due to the strong hydrogen bonding in these fluids. A third group includes adsorprives such as benzene, where the <b>heat</b> <b>curve</b> is constant in the sub-monolayer coverage region (but {{is higher than the}} condensation heat) and then drops off to the condensation heat when higher layers are formed. The constant heat in the sub-monolayer region is due to the balance between the energy factor (from fluid-fluid interaction) and entropy factor (due to re-orientation of adsorbed molecules). Our proposed classification is supported by detailed GCMC simulations of various gases that {{have been reported in the}} literature, and we supplement these with new results for the adsorption of xenon on graphite to investigate in more detail the change in heat pattern with temperature. Xenon is chosen because of its high fluid-fluid interaction, allowing us to study the 2 D-phase transition in the first as well as higher layers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

It can be obtained that between 20 °C and 100 °C, the largest variable quantity of the resistivity is just about 0.28 Ω. After linear fitting, {{the slopes of the}} <b>heating</b> <b>curve</b> and the cooling curve, which can be called temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), approximately have the same slope (kh = kc = 0.0007 aR/°C− 1), indicating the good thermal stability of the conductive silver line. The TCR is a little different compared with the TCR of bulk silver (0.0038 aR/°C− 1). This phenomenon is mainly caused by the complex microstructure of the silver thin film which will bring more barriers during the electron-transfer process. Moreover, it also can be seen that though the <b>heating</b> <b>curve</b> and cooling curve have the same TCR, the cooling curve is always below the <b>heating</b> <b>curve.</b> This is mainly because the natural cooling process (about 28 min) needs more time than the heating process (15 min).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{magnetic}} nanoparticles for magnetic hyperthermia cancer treatment is a rapidly developing field of multidisciplinary research. From the material's standpoint, the main {{challenge is to}} optimize the heating properties of the material while maintaining {{the frequency of the}} exciting field as low as possible to avoid biological side effects. The figure of merit in this context is the specific absorption rate (SAR), which is usually measured from calorimetric experiments. Such measurements, which we refer to as heating curves, contain a substantial amount of information regarding the energy barrier distribution of the sample. This follows because the SAR itself is a function of temperature, and reflect the underlying magneto-thermal properties of the system. Unfortunately, however, this aspect of the problem is seldom explored and, commonly, only the SAR at ambient temperature is extracted from the <b>heating</b> <b>curve.</b> In this paper we introduce a simple model capable of describing the entire <b>heating</b> <b>curve</b> via a single differential equation. The SAR enters as a forcing term, thus facilitating the use of different models for it. We discuss in detail the heating in the context of Néel relaxation and show that high anisotropy samples may present an inflection point related to the reduction of the energy barrier caused by the increase in temperature. Mono-disperse and poli-disperse systems are discussed in detail and a new alternative to compute the temperature dependence of the SAR from the <b>heating</b> <b>curve</b> is presented...|$|E

The proposed method was tested to predict the heating curves for methane hydrate dissociation in a mesoporous silica glass for saturated conditions (liquid volume = pore volume) and for a fractional conversion of water to hydrate of 1 (100 % of the available water was converted to hydrate). The shape factor (F) of the hydrate-water interface was found equal to 1, supporting a cylindrical shape for the hydrate particles during hydrate dissociation. Using F = 1, it has been possible to predict the <b>heating</b> <b>curve</b> for different ranges of pressure and temperature.

40|$|When {{interpreting}} thermomagnetic {{curves of}} non-saturated magnetic minerals, irreversible {{heating and cooling}} curves need not necessarily imply chemical or structural changes. Increased aligning of magnetic moments on heating in an applied magnetic field can also induce an irreversible cooling curve. The two processes can be distinguished by stirring the sample between subsequent thermomagnetic runs. Sample redispersion considerably enhances the interpretative value of thermomagnetic analysis and is therefore strongly recommended, in particular when analysing non-saturated magnetic minerals. Stirring between subsequent runs was extensively used {{in the analysis of}} the thermomagnetic behaviour of haematite and goethite as a function of grain size (i. e. coercivity) in various non-saturating magnetic fields (10 - 350 mT). The shape of the thermomagnetic heating curves of haematite is shown to be dependent on the competitive interplay between the temperature dependence of the exchange energy and that of the coercive force with respect to the applied field. On heating, pure defectpoor haematite, which is magnetically dominated by the canted moment, has an initially increasing thermomagnetic <b>heating</b> <b>curve.</b> Further heating causes the magnetization to increase smoothly up to a certain temperature which depends critically on the applied field and the coercivity of the sample. The irreversible block-shaped thermomagnetic cooling curve lies above the <b>heating</b> <b>curve,</b> and shows hardly any dependence on applied field and grain size. In contrast to the <b>heating</b> <b>curve,</b> the shape of the cooling curve depends only on the temperature variation of the exchange energy. Our data seem to indicate that for defect-poor haematites the domain configuration acquired at the maximum heating temperature is retained on cooling to room temperature. More defect-rich haematite has a gently decreasing thermomagnetic <b>heating</b> <b>curve.</b> On heating to increasingly elevated temperatures (800 °C) the defects are annealed out off the lattice, because the thermomagnetic curves approach those of defect-poor haematite. The defect moment due to lattice defects seems to be additive to, but softer than, the canted moment. The canted and defect moment appear to have the same Neel (or Curie) temperature (= 680 °C), because no change in temperature was observed, whilst the relative contributions did change. The thermomagnetic behaviour of goethite is shown to be dependent on its coercivity and the amount of substituted ions...|$|E

These curves depend on only five parameters: temperature, density, redshift, [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe]. They are easily tabulated and can be efficiently interpolated during a simulation. The ionization equilibrium of 14 key elements is determined for temperatures between 10 K and 10 (9) K and densities up to 100 amu cm(- 3) taking into account collisional and radiative ionization, by the cosmic UV background and an interstellar radiation field, and by charge-transfer reactions.
