50|$|At {{the height}} of its popularity, richly {{decorated}} <b>japanned</b> ware was {{to be seen in}} every middle-class home, but from the mid-19th century, this began to change. By the 1880s, the <b>japanning</b> and tin-plate industries were in decline. This was due partly to changes in fashion and taste and partly due to the development of electroplating. In response, makers of <b>japanned</b> ware began to focus on more utilitarian items, including <b>japanned</b> cash boxes. Many turned to other trades, including enamelling, electroplating and the manufacture of copper and brass coal scuttles, fire screens and kettles. By the 1920s, the West Midlands' decorative <b>japanned</b> ware industry had largely died out. Many firms began to supply <b>japanned</b> metal to the newly established bicycle and motor vehicle industries, and some even made their own bicycles. The most successful of these was John Marston, whose <b>japanning</b> factory began making bicycles in 1887. The bicycle manufacturing part of the business quickly became more successful than the production of decorative <b>japanned</b> ware. Marston's wife thought the gilt on the black <b>japanned</b> bicycles looked like sunbeams and the bicycles were branded Sunbeam and their factory was named Sunbeamland.|$|R

[...] According to Samuel Timmins' book Birmingham and the Midland Hardware District, published in 1866, there were 2000 people employed in the <b>japanning</b> and tin-plate industries in Wolverhampton and Bilston at the time. <b>Japanning</b> firms ranged in size from small family workshops, which often adjoined the proprietor's home, to a few large factories employing over 250 people. In the larger workshops, the production of tin plate and papier-mâché articles and the <b>japanning</b> process all took place under one roof, while small workshops tended to carry out {{only one or two}} of the trades, usually tin-plate working and <b>japanning.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Japanning</b> is {{most often}} a heavy black [...] "lacquer", almost like enamel paint. Black is common and <b>japanning</b> is often assumed to be synonymous with black <b>japanning.</b> The European {{technique}} uses varnishes that have a resin base, similar to shellac, applied in heat-dried layers which are then polished, to give a smooth glossy finish. It can also come in reds, greens and blues.|$|R
50|$|As {{the demand}} for all things <b>japanned</b> grew, the Italian {{technique}} for imitating Asian lacquerwork also spread. The art of <b>japanning</b> developed in seventeenth-century Britain, France, Italy, and the Low Countries. The technique was described in manuals such as Stalker and Parker's Treatise of <b>Japanning</b> and Varnishing, published in Oxford in 1688. Colonial Boston was a major center of the <b>japanning</b> trade in America, where {{at least a dozen}} cabinetmakers included it among their specialties. In England, decoupage, the art of applying paper cutouts to other items, became very popular, especially the botanically inspired works of Mary Delany.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} Chinoiserie {{which appeared in}} English furniture during the period between the Glorious Revolution and the mid-eighteenth century. Chinoiserie in furniture originated {{in the attempt to}} imitate the brilliant coating and the decoration of Chinese and Japanese lacquer. The attempt to do this started during 1630 s in England, and was called ‘japanning’ in English. When a sharpened taste for luxury arose after the Restoration, Chinoiserie was accepted as the decoration of a great interior, in which both imported lacquer ware and English <b>japanned</b> furniture became constituent elements. English <b>japanned</b> furniture came into fashion and reached its peak between 1690 and 1720. The English style of <b>japanned</b> furniture is characterised by a glossy surface and a wider range of different coloured grounds, which developed in Europe. It was made after the current fashion of European furniture. At first, Chinese decoration was copied realistically, but in this period the western method of drawing in perspective was introduced. Consequently, a different style of lacquer furniture from the original Chinese lacquer ware was established. Even after the peak of its popularity, the publication of <b>japanning</b> manuals continued, in which drawing in perspective was also taught. <b>Japanning</b> was tried by amateurs, and was counted as polite accomplishments of ladies. Also, <b>japanned</b> furniture was exported to continental Europe, while the <b>japanning</b> technique was transmitted to North America. During the 1740 s <b>japanning</b> on metal ware developed in Pontypool, in south Wales, and during the next decade three-dimensional Chinoiserie appeared in English furniture. In this way, English Chinoiserie spread beyond the palaces of the rich to the homes of ordinary people...|$|R
