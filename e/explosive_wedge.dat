40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was conducted {{for the purpose of}} achieving a more fundamental understanding of the shaped charge liner shock loading environment. The test configuration, representing the middle portion of a shaped charge, consists of a 50 mm deep, 100 mm tall, and 2 mm thick copper plate driven by 50 mm deep, 100 mm tall, tapered thickness wedge of LX- 14. An electrically driven 50 mm square flyer is used to surface initiate the base of the LX- 14 causing a plane detonation wave to propagate into the <b>explosive</b> <b>wedge</b> along the liner surface. Fabry-Perot laser velocimetry measures the particle velocity time history of the plate. The CTH and DYNA 2 D hydrocodes are used to simulate the experiments. Calculations of the velocity profiles are compared to the experimental results. The effects of mesh density, copper material failure and strength models, and explosive detonation models are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are the determination of detonation velocity, shock sensitivity, impact sensitivity, etc.; and the acquisition of high-precision one-dimensional hydrodynamic data for use in establishing detonation product equations-of-state, performance of <b>explosives,</b> etc. A <b>wedge</b> test series was begun on RX- 25 -AA. This is the first attempt in this work to study a composite <b>explosive</b> with the <b>wedge</b> test. Behavior appears to be quite different from the standard explosives...|$|R
50|$|During the Vadamarachchi Operation (Operation Liberation) the Sri Lanka Army {{took over}} Nelliady Madhya Maha Vidyalayam {{and turned it}} into a {{military}} base. The LTTE resolved to capture the base which was heavily reinforced and surrounded by barbed wire. Miller volunteered to drive a bomb filled vehicle into the heart of the base. Miller visited his family on 29 June 1987 and treated them and his friends to ice cream. On 5 July 1987 the LTTE filled a truck with <b>explosives</b> and <b>wedged</b> Miller's body into the driver's seat so that couldn't move even if he wanted to. His hands were tied to the steering wheel and one foot to the accelerator. Fellow LTTE cadres started the truck which started moving. Miller steered the explosive filled truck into the army camp at Nelliady Madhya Maha Vidyalayam. Miller was most likely killed at the first barricades when soldiers opened fire but the truck kept going, ramming into the main school building and exploding. The explosion created a crater as big as a bus. Other LTTE cadres who were following Miller's truck launched an attack on the camp and captured it. Scores of soldiers were killed and wounded.|$|R
