40|$|The {{particle}} number method {{based on the}} Particle Measurement Programme (PMP) {{is part of the}} light duty legislation and starts to expand to other sectors as well. As a consequence systems for <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>conformity</b> and random driving emissions procedures will be necessary. These systems should be small and compact. The commercial systems at the moment are not ready for on-road use because the Particle Number Counters (PNCs) sensors (condensation particle counters, CPC) are sensitive to vibrations. For this reason a different concept has been suggested: Diffusion chargers (DC). The main target of this report was to evaluate theoretically and experimentally in the lab various PN-PEMS using diffusion chargers as PNCs as alternative technique to the PMP method for on-road measurements. It was shown theoretically that DCs introduce an extra 50 % uncertainty due to a size dependency since the size is not known during a test; PMP systems should have < 15 % differences [...] Then various protottype PN-PEMS were evaluated in the lab. It was shown experimentally that it is feasible to cover a size range of 35 - 90 nm (for polydisperse aerosol) with differences within - 33 % and + 50 % to the PMP system. Based on the experience gained during the evaluations a suitable calibration setup and procedure is recommended. In addition calibration specifications {{for the next generation of}} PN-PEMS is given. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of three Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS) for Particulate Matter (PM) was assessed in our laboratory against reference instrumentation in engine dynamometer testing of five Heavy Duty Engines (HDEs) of different aftertreatment technologies. The candidate systems were designed around the minimum requirements of allowing a gravimetric {{determination of the}} total emitted PM mass and incorporating a real time particle sensor. All PEMS-PM systems were found to reproduce within ± 30 % the gravimetric PM results determined with reference measurement systems under non-regenerative operating conditions, at emission levels lying at and above the Euro VI limit of 10 mg/kWh. The use of prolonged sampling times envisaged in <b>In</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Conformity</b> (ISC) testing (> 120 min) {{was found to be}} beneficial, as it reduced the limit of detection of the PEMS-PM instrumentation to 1 - 3 mg/kWh (120 min) from 3 to 9 mg/kWh (30 min). The real time aerosol instrumentation exhibited a much higher sensitivity, being capable of quantifying emission levels below the EURO VI particle number limit of 6 × 1011 #/kWh. Some modifications were required though in two particle sensors that were based on diffusion charging, in order to avoid a disproportional increase in their responses in the presence of homogeneously nucleated particles. Passive regeneration of the particulate filter resulted in excessive emission of volatile PM but also large discrepancies between the PEMS-PM and reference systems. The accurate quantification of absolute emission levels of non-volatile PM from the real time sensors can assist in the identification of such excessive volatile PM fractions, to avoid properly working DPF systems to fail an ISC test.

When Charles arrived in Milan, he faced a daunting task. Milan was the largest archdiocese in Italy at the time, with more than 3,000 clergy and 800,000 people. Both its clergy and laity had drifted from church teaching. The selling of indulgences and ecclesiastical positions was prevalent; monasteries were [...] "full of disorder"; many religious were [...] "lazy, ignorant, and debauched". Charles made numerous pastoral visits, and restored dignity to divine <b>service.</b> <b>In</b> <b>conformity</b> with the decrees of the Council of Trent, which suggested simplifying church interiors, he cleared the cathedral of ornate tombs, rich ornaments, banners and arms. He did not even spare the monuments of his own relatives. He divided the nave of the church into two compartments to separate the sexes at worship.|$|R

Besides, this study compares some factors expectedbetween micro, small and medium enterprise bank customers. It is based on theory relationship of relational benefit and satisfaction. With the sample of 150 conventional bank customers of Micro, Small and Medium enterprise in Surabaya and cities surround, analysis is done. This analysis is conducted by descriptive analysis, factor, and multiple regressions using SPSS 18. Relational benefits are expected by micro enterprise is that the customer intimacy to contact personnel, and trust over quality, both factors are influencing satisfaction. For small enterprises, relational benefits expected are that customer intimacy to contact personnel and also <b>conformity</b> of <b>services</b> and priority. From these three factors, factors influencing satisfaction is <b>conformity</b> of <b>services</b> and priority. While for medium enterprises relational benefits expected is customer intimacy to contact personnel, additional <b>services</b> and <b>conformity</b> of <b>services.</b> From these three factors, factors influencing satisfaction is additional <b>services</b> and <b>conformity</b> of <b>services...</b>|$|R
