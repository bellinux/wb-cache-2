2500|$|The tanagers (singular [...] ) {{comprise}} the bird family Thraupidae, {{in the order}} Passeriformes. The family has an American distribution. The Thraupidae are the second-largest family of birds and represent about 4% of all avian species and 12% of the Neotropical birds. Traditionally, about 240 species of tanagers have been described, but the taxonomic treatment of this family's members is currently {{in a state of}} flux. As more of these birds are studied using modern molecular techniques, some genera are expected to be relocated elsewhere. Already, species in the genera <b>Euphonia</b> and Chlorophonia, which were once considered part of the tanager family, are now treated as members of Fringillidae, in their own subfamily (Euphoniinae). Likewise, the genera Piranga (which includes the scarlet tanager, summer tanager, and western tanager), Chlorothraupis, and Habia appear to be members of the cardinal family, and have been reassigned to that family by the American Ornithologists' Union.|$|E
6000|$|A dispute {{occurred}} {{whether the}} Gaelic or Italian language was most liquid, and best adapted for poetry; the opinion for the Gaelic, which probably {{might not have}} found supporters elsewhere, was here fiercely defended by seven Highland ladies, who talked {{at the top of}} their lungs, and screamed the company deaf with examples of Celtic <b>euphonia.</b> Flora, observing the Lowland ladies sneer at the comparison, produced some reasons to show that it was not altogether so absurd; but Rose, when asked for her opinion, gave it with animation in praise of Italian, which she had studied with Waverley's assistance. [...] "She has a more correct ear than Flora, though a less accomplished musician," [...] said Waverley to himself.

50|$|The black-throated <b>euphonia</b> is {{a bird in}} the Thraupidae, or Tanager family. It {{is known}} only by a single {{specimen}} in the British Natural History Museum with the type locality given as Rio de Janeiro, and was originally described as <b>Euphonia</b> vittata by Philip Sclater in 1861.

Some species may also eat some insects.|$|R

50|$|Phoradendron {{species are}} hemiparasites which {{produce their own}} {{chlorophyll}} but rely on the host plant to provide water, minerals, and other nutrients. Birds are the primary means of dispersal of the parasite. Birds consume the drupes of the mistletoe and excrete or regurgitate the seeds onto {{the branches of the}} host plant. Germinating seeds produce a radicle, a holdfast, and eventually the germinated seeds produce haustoria. The haustorium is a root-like structure that penetrates the host plant's bark and cambium, reaching the xylem and phloem where it extracts water and minerals, primarily carbon and nitrogen compounds. The most important birds for effective dispersal include the cedar waxwing, <b>euphonias,</b> silky-flycatchers, bluebirds, and thrushes.|$|R

5000|$|Birds are {{the primary}} disease vector in the {{dispersal}} of the plant parasite leafy mistletoe. Birds consume the seeds from the fruit of P. tomentosum, also called drupes, and excrete or regurgitate the seeds onto the branches of which the birds perch. The most important birds for effective dispersal include cedar waxwings, <b>euphonias,</b> silky flycatcher, bluebirds, thrushes, robins, and solitaires. The seeds germinate within the tree for several years, eventually producing a haustorium, a root-like structure, that penetrates the host plant and extracts water and minerals from the infected tree or plant. Phoradendron is a hemiparasite, meaning that it produces its own chlorophyll, but relies on the host plant to provide essential elements for growth and survival. [...] Stems, flowers, and fruits also grow from the seed following germination with fruits being produced several years after infection.|$|R
