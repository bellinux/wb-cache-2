500|$|Liam Geddes {{submitted}} [...] "Sometimes" [...] to {{the judging}} panel at RTÉ, written by Susan Hewitt. The song {{was performed by}} Geddes {{on the night of}} the contest in a red shirt and suit, as well as with a female pianist, a violinist and cellist, as well as a male and a female backing singer. The song began with Geddes sitting on a stool, leaning against the piano, before he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> around the stage.|$|E
500|$|Fearnet critic Alyse Wax wrote [...] "This episode made {{my brain}} hurt. [...] And I {{mean that in}} the nicest way possible. They were {{throwing}} a lot of weird shit at us. It was great because I feel like we are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just maybe {{get rid of the}} Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> out of the room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E
2500|$|The movie did poorly {{at the box}} office. Huston {{suggests}} that it was possibly because it [...] "brought war very close to home." [...] Huston recalls that at the preview showing, before the film was halfway through, [...] "damn near {{a third of the}} audience <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> out of the theater." [...] Despite the [...] "butchering" [...] and weak public response, film historian Michael Barson describes the movie as [...] "a minor masterpiece." ...|$|E
60|$|Alone again, he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> stretched, <b>walked</b> absently {{the length}} of the room and back.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wentworth {{looked at}} him and then at all the others; then he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> slowly <b>walked</b> away.|$|R
60|$|Thorn {{sat down}} and when Mrs. Osborn had given him some tea they talked about other matters. Presently Grace <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> he <b>walked</b> with her across the lawn.|$|R
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} during a hiatus time in The Who's touring schedule. The top single off the album, [...] "Giving it All Away", reached number {{five in the}} UK and the album made the Top 50 in the United States. He also released a single in 1973, [...] "Thinking" [...] with B-side [...] "There is Love" [...] which features Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin on guitar. Bizarrely, the British release, with considerable airplay of [...] "Giving it All Away" [...] (first lines [...] "I paid all my dues so I picked up my shoes, I <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> away") coincided with news reports of The Who being sued for unpaid damage to their hotel on a recent tour, including a TV set being {{thrown out of the}} window.|$|E
2500|$|Shamrock {{was then}} matched up with UFC 5 tournament {{champion}} Dan Severn at UFC 6 on July 14, 1995 {{to determine the}} reigning champion of the UFC. The 'superfight', a match presented as a fight between the [...] "best of the best", was still the match that would determine the UFC champion and the tournament winners would be considered the #1 contender for the newly created UFC Superfight Championship (later replaced by the UFC Heavyweight Championship when weight categories {{were introduced to the}} UFC). Their feud began at the pre-fight press conference. After most of the attention from the media was given to Shamrock, Severn <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> out of the door without explanation. Shamrock took Severn's action as a sign of disrespect. Severn later said that he walked out because he felt that it would be unfair to Shamrock for him to be present in the room while Shamrock was discussing his fight strategy to the media. Shamrock became even more furious when he found a newsletter back at the hotel that explained to readers how Severn was going to destroy Shamrock. During the match, Shamrock forced Severn to tap out to a choke in 2:14 to win the UFC Superfight Championship.|$|E

5000|$|... "The Pig <b>Got</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> Slowly <b>Walked</b> Away" [...] is a 1933 temperance-themed {{song with}} lyrics by Benjamin Hapgood Burt. It was also sung by Fozzie Bear in episode 209 of The Muppet Show.|$|R
60|$|Kirk <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{began to}} <b>walk</b> quickly <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down. Steve watched him furtively.|$|R
60|$|He <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> plainly agitated, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> to the window. Then {{he turned}} to me appealingly.|$|R
60|$|Charnock <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> {{about the}} floor. Then he stopped {{opposite}} his wife.|$|E
60|$|Then he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> {{across to}} where the others were chatting together.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Leeds <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> up {{and down}} the room two or three minutes.|$|E
60|$|Denis <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> they <b>walked</b> off {{together}} into the darkness. The music grew fainter behind them. Some {{of the higher}} notes faded out altogether. Jenny's drumming and the steady sawing of the bass throbbed on, tuneless and meaningless in their ears. Henry Wimbush halted.|$|R
60|$|Then he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> slow <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> to the wigwam, {{and went}} in there without saying {{anything}} but that. But that was enough. It made me feel so mean I could almost kissed HIS foot {{to get him to}} take it back.|$|R
60|$|He <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> yawning, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> to the door, and Mr. Spriggs, after a {{momentary}} idea of breaking him in pieces and throwing him {{out into the}} street, blew out the lamp and went upstairs {{to discuss the matter}} with his wife until morning.|$|R
60|$|I <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> to the window, {{and came}} back again and stood before her.|$|E
60|$|After some uneasy {{moving in}} his seat, he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> about, looking very much dissatisfied.|$|E
60|$|She <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> {{about the}} room, angrily {{brushing}} aside the proffered attentions of Mr. Tucker.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you imagine}} that!" [...] <b>and</b> they all <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> dispersed, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> about <b>and</b> lit cigarettes, and {{generally}} {{tried to show}} they were perfectly amiable and disengaged, and entirely free from the slightest curiosity about me and the sphere. [...] "I'm going {{to keep an eye}} on that ship out there all the same," [...] I heard one of them remarking in an undertone. If only they could have forced themselves to it, they would, I believe, even have gone out and left me. I went on with my third egg.|$|R
60|$|I <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{began to}} <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the room, while she watched {{me with a}} silent calm which was incomprehensible. In vain I summoned my faculties to meet it.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned and}} {{looked at me as if}} I were a stranger; she <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> began to <b>walk</b> about the room; then she left the room, and I heard her go out of the house.|$|R
60|$|She <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> to the door, and {{her brother}} {{did not attempt to}} stop her.|$|E
60|$|At this point, finding Hans hopeless, I <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> away, {{leaving him}} to finish our preparations.|$|E
60|$|The gentleman <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> to {{the window}} again and back: seriously uneasy, though giving his uneasiness this {{peculiar}} expression.|$|E
60|$|The {{clock on}} the tower over the senior block chimed quarter after quarter, but Mike sat on, thinking. It was quite late when he <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> began to <b>walk</b> back to Acacia Road. He felt cold and stiff and very miserable.|$|R
50|$|On June 18, Fred Lynn had one {{of those}} games that players can only dream about. The Red Sox were in Detroit and had won the first two games of the series, with second-year regular Juan Beníquez having two big games - a triple to start a winning rally in the opener and a homer to win the second. Unable to sleep, Fred Lynn <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> <b>got</b> dressed <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> the streets of {{downtown}} Detroit {{for an hour or two}} after 6 a.m. Still restless, he had breakfast and then went to Tiger Stadium to get extra batting practice. Whatever it was in the recipe that worked, it worked remarkably well.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know; I know. I saw it. He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> again, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> off {{as well as}} ever. A fall on {{the leaves}} didn't hurt a spry fellow like him. He did not come this way," [...] he added, significantly. [...] "I suppose he went to look for his horse. I tried to find him, but could not. But after seeing him go away under the trees I found the horse, and have led it home for safety. So he must walk. Now, don't you stay out here in this night air." ...|$|R
60|$|Festing <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> about irresolutely for {{a moment}} or two. Then he stopped with some color in his face.|$|E
60|$|Insall <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> {{to the end}} of the terrace, {{gazing at}} a bluebird on the edge of the lawn.|$|E
60|$|He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> quickly out of {{the room}} into his study. Philip heard him shut the door and lock it.|$|E
5000|$|Canadian author Thomas Chandler Haliburton {{used the}} phrase twice in his 1835 book The clockmaker; or the sayings and doings of Samuel Slick of Slickville: [...] "And with that he turned right round, {{and sat down to}} his map and never said another word, lookin' as mad as a hatter the whole blessed time" [...] and [...] "Father he larfed out like any thing; I thought he would never stop - and sister Sall <b>got</b> right <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> out of the room, as mad as a hatter. Says she, Sam, I do believe you are a born fool, I vow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe it}} was that that brought Bill round, and the next moment Dodgy was on ’is back with a blow that nearly knocked his ’ead off. Charlie grabbed at Tom’s watch and began to count, and after a little bit called out Time,’ It was a silly thing to do, as it would ’ave stopped the fight then and there if it ’adn’t been for Tom’s {{presence}} of mind, saying it was two minutes slow. That gave Dodgy a chance, <b>and</b> he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> again <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> round Bill very careful, swearing ’ard at {{the small size of}} the fo’c’s’le.|$|R
60|$|The {{officer and}} his men mounted at once, and rode off at full speed. Leigh {{remained}} quiet until Menou and the other officers rode out from the courtyard and proceeded down the street, followed by their escort. Then he <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> stretched himself, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> slowly {{to the spot where}} his two comrades were awaiting him.|$|R
