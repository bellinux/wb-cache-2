The technical term is [...] "electrosurgical branding". Though it is technically possible to use a medical laser for scarification, this term refers not an actual laser, but rather an <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>unit</b> which uses electricity to cut and cauterize the skin, {{similar to the way}} an arc welder works. Electric sparks jump from the hand-held pen of the device to the skin, vaporizing it. This is a more precise form of scarification, because it is possible to greatly regulate the depth and nature of the damage being done to the skin. Whereas with traditional direct branding, heat is transferred to the tissues surrounding the brand, burning and damaging them, electrosurgery branding vaporizes the skin so precisely and so quickly that little to no heat or damage to the surrounding skin is caused. This means that pain and healing time after the scarification is greatly lessened.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Despite of {{more than}} a hundred years of electrosurgery, only a few {{electrosurgical}} equipment manufacturers have developed methods to regulate the active power delivered to the patient, usually around an arbitrary setpoint. In fact, no manufacturer has a method to measure the active power actually delivered to the load. Measuring the delivered power and computing it fast enough so as to avoid injury to the organic tissue is challenging. If voltage and current signals can be sampled in time and discretized in the frequency domain, a simple and very fast multiplication process can be used to determine the active power. Methods This paper presents an approach for measuring active power at the output power stage of <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>units</b> with mathematical shortcuts based on a simple multiplication procedure of discretized variables – frequency domain vectors – obtained through Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) applied on time-sampled voltage and current vectors. Results Comparative results between simulations and a practical experiment are presented – all being in accordance with the requirements of the applicable industry standards. Conclusion An analysis is presented comparing the active power analytically obtained through well-known voltage and current signals against a computational methodology based on vector manipulation using DFT only for time-to-frequency domain transformation. The greatest advantage of this method is to determine the active power of noisy and phased out signals with neither complex DFT or ordinary transform methodologies nor sophisticated computing techniques such as convolution. All results presented errors substantially lower than the thresholds defined by the applicable standards...|$|R

3000|$|... hen the <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>unit</b> is {{activated}} without the active electrode {{in contact with}} the tissue (i.e., open circuit activation), a high-voltage level emerges at the active instrument. This may cause stray currents. Poor quality of contact between the dispersive pad and the patient’s skin compromises a safe return of the current to the generator. The dispersive pad must be of low resistance with a large enough surface (> 20  cm 2). When the dispersive pad is (partially) detached through bony prominences, adipose, excessive hair, scar tissue, presence of fluid or lotions, or dryness of the pad, the current exiting the body can have a high density. This may produce heat and unintended burns {{at the site of the}} dispersive pad. The use of a return electrode monitoring system averts these burns.

40|$|Introduction The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} the potential electromagnetic interference of electronic apex locators (EALs) on implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Methods Four different EALs were tested {{for their ability to}} interfere with the correct function of 3 different ICDs. Each ICD was placed in a plastic container with 1. 5 L physiological saline, and the EAL unit was placed at a distance of 2. 5 cm from the ICD. The file electrode and lip clip were placed directly against the ICD. The EAL was turned on for 30 seconds while continuously showing the "APEX" mark. As a negative control, the ICD was tested without EAL for 30 seconds. An <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>unit</b> served as a positive control.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the long-term follow-up {{results of the}} eyelid margin tumor resection using a radio-frequency electro-surgical unit. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 53 patients (55 eyes) diagnosed with eyelid margin tumor and who underwent eyelid tumor resection using a radio-frequency <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>unit</b> more than 5 years prior. Age, gender, undergoing a biopsy, recurrence,- and complications were examined through phone questions and the out-patient department. Results: The study included 23 eyes of 22 males and, 32 eyes of 31 females, (age range 8. 6 - 76. 8 years). Surgical success rate was 95 % (52 of 55 eyes) and mean follow-up period was 8. 9 years. Thirty-four of 55 patients underwent a biopsy, and the most common cases were intradermal nevus and compound nevus (13 cases each), 2 cases of basal cell carcinoma (5. 9 %), 2 cases of actinic keratosis (5. 9 %), and, 2 cases of chronic inflammation (5. 9 %). Other cases included 1 case of squamous papilloma (2. 9 %) and 1 case of fibrosis (2. 9 %). There were 3 cases of recurrence.

30|$|Implantable {{devices that}} use {{electric}} current {{may be affected}} by the use of electrosurgery. In monopolar surgery, interaction of the current with a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) may have life-threatening consequences. Adverse effects include damage to the device, inability to deliver pacing or shocks, lead tissue interface damage, and electrical reset. The preoperative management of the CIED function should be guided by the cardiologist or anesthesiologist [42]. The risk of interference is low in procedures where the path between the active electrode and dispersive pad does not cross the CIED or its leads. There may be some diffusion of current and it is therefore safer to use bipolar electrosurgery or ultrasonic technology in patients with implantable electronic devices [55, 56]. Conductive prosthetics should as well be placed out of the direct path of the circuit since activation of the <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>unit</b> may cause heating of the prosthetic material.|$|E
