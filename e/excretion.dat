Presumably these phenomenons were caused by the anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria in the sludge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} effect of root <b>excretions</b> of spring cereal seedlings on seed germination of field pea and common vetch. The experiment carried out in March and April 2009 under laboratory conditions (in the IUNG laboratory) involved oat, barley, wheat, triticale, field pea and common vetch. Two concentrations of <b>excretions</b> were applied: I – corresponding to the effect of one cereal seedling on one legume seed, II – corresponding to the effect of five cereal seedlings on one legume seed. The effects were examined after 4 and 8 days. Root <b>excretions</b> applied in a lower concentration usually had no effect on the tested parameters characterizing the germination of peas and vetch seeds. However, the stimulating effect of barley <b>excretions</b> on the length of the pea and vetch rootlet was recorded as well as the effect of triticale on the length of rootlet and the mass and length of germ in pea. Favorable effect of triticale <b>excretions</b> was found both after 4 and 8 days from their application. Cereal <b>excretions</b> with higher concentrations, except for oat <b>excretions,</b> had mostly an inhibitory and in some cases even destructive effect on seed germination. No favorable effect of wheat <b>excretions</b> on seeds of both legume species was observed on any treatments...|$|R

The results have been expressed in the principal ways used in clinical practice. The best way to express the <b>excretions</b> of GGT and AGL was with the fractional <b>excretions.</b> For LYS and MAD, the fractional clearances appeared to be theoretically valuable. They were not significantly influenced by sex or by the different urinary collections. Forced diuresis caused a significant scattering of enzymuria...|$|R

40|$|The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera:  Psyllidae) is {{the main}} vector of {{bacteria}} responsible for citrus huanglongbing (citrus greening), the most serious citrus disease worldwide. Behavioral and ultrastructural studies on ‘honeydew’ <b>excretions</b> by ACP indicated interesting differences between nymphs, males and females. The anal opening in ACP, near the posterior end of the abdomen, is on the ventral side in nymphs and on the dorsal side in adults. Video recordings showed that males produce clear sticky droplets of honeydew gently laid behind them on the leaf surface, whereas females powerfully expel whitish, different shaped pellets that travel away from the female, probably to get these sticky <b>excretions</b> away from eggs and newly-hatched nymphs. ACP nymphs produce long ribbons or tubes of honeydew <b>excretions</b> that frequently stay attached to the exuviae after molting. Honeydew <b>excretions</b> of both nymphs and adult females are covered with {{a thin layer of}} whitish wax-like material ultrastructurally composed of a convoluted network of thin filaments apparently produced by the “wax” glands underneath the anal ring, which is absent in males of this and other psyllid species.

40|$|We {{investigated}} which variables possibly {{influence the}} amount of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) shed in secretions and <b>excretions</b> by FMDV infected animals, as {{it is likely that}} {{the amount of}} FMDV shed is related to transmission risk. First, in a separate analysis of laboratory data, we showed that the total amount of FMDV in secretions and <b>excretions</b> from infected animals is highly correlated with maximum titres of FMDV. Next, we collected data from 32 published scientific articles in which FMDV infection experiments were described. The maximum titres of FMDV reported in different secretions and <b>excretions</b> (the response variable) and the experimental conditions in which they occurred (the explanatory variables), were recorded in a database and analyzed using multivariate regression models with and without random effects. In both types of models, maximum titres of FMDV were significantly (p < 0. 05) associated with types of secretions and <b>excretions,</b> animal species, stage of the disease and days post infection.

40|$|The {{complement}} system {{plays an important}} role in the activation of the inflammatory response to injury, although inappropriate complement activation (CA) can lead to severe tissue damage. Maggot therapy is successfully used to treat infected wounds. In this study, we hypothesized that maggot excretions/secretions influence CA in order to modulate the host's inflammatory response. Therefore, the effect of maggot <b>excretions</b> on CA was investigated in preoperatively and postoperatively obtained sera from patients. Our results show that maggot <b>excretions</b> reduce CA in healthy and postoperatively immune-activated human sera up to 99. 9 %, via all pathways. Maggot <b>excretions</b> do not specifically initiate or inhibit CA, but break down complement proteins C 3 and C 4 in a cation-independent manner and this effect proves to be temperature tolerant. This study indicates a CA-reducing substrate that is already successfully used in clinical practice and may explain part of the improved wound healing caused by maggot therapy. Furthermore, the complement activation-reducing substance present in maggot <b>excretions</b> could provide a novel treatment modality for several diseases, resulting from an (over) active {{complement system}}...|$|R

5|$|As much as 80% of {{therapeutic}} doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters.

Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal <b>excretion</b> becomes increasingly important.|$|E

Both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion act {{in the liver}} as potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP2D6, which metabolizes not only bupropion itself but also {{a variety of other}} drugs and biologically active substances.
