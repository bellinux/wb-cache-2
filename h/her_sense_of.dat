5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills. Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and <b>her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but <b>her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E
5|$|While a French citizen, Marie Skłodowska Curie, {{who used}} both surnames, never lost <b>her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Polish identity. She taught her daughters the Polish {{language}} {{and took them}} on visits to Poland. She named the first chemical element that she discoveredpolonium, which she isolated in 1898after her native country.|$|E

5|$|The {{disaster}} gained international notoriety {{due in part}} to {{a photograph}} taken by photographer Frank Fournier of a young girl named Omayra Sánchez, who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. Following the eruption, relief workers gathered around the girl, speaking with her and listening to her responses. She attracted the attention of the reporters at the site because of <b>her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> dignity and courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment).|$|E
5|$|Being the South's {{first line}} of defense against foreign threats, the NSS houses {{technology}} unavailable to their sister intelligence agencies. The two primary tech agents, Yang Mi-jung (Juni) and Hwang Tae-sung (Na Yoon), are often responsible for ensuring field agents have all that is required to see their missions through. Mi-jung does not meet the expected conventions of someone involved in national intelligence. Given that <b>her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> fashion and general interests are more contemporary than that of her associates, she often stands out from the others, but her status as the top hacker in Korea has made her irreplaceable. Still, Tae-sung remains the more perdurable of the two and is often instrumental in the success of a number of operations.|$|E

60|$|At night Carley gazed {{over and}} into the black void. But for the awful <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> depth {{she would not have}} known the Canyon to be there. A soundless {{movement}} of wind passed under her. The chasm seemed a grave of silence. It was as mysterious as the stars and as aloof and as inevitable. It had held <b>her</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> beauty and proportion in abeyance.|$|R
5000|$|Diana {{left the}} show after episode 4 due to illness. Her {{departure}} was {{announced at the}} start of episode 5. The night before episode 5 was scheduled to be taped, she suffered a head injury, resulting in an overnight stay in A&E and a loss <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> taste and smell that persisted.|$|R
5|$|Driving on, Marion {{stops for}} {{the night at the}} Bates Motel. The proprietor, Norman Bates, invites her to a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts, but then hears an {{argument}} between Norman and his mother about bringing a woman into her house. They eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have a life outside of her. <b>Her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> compassion and responsibility awakened by Norman's story, Marion decides to go back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, and prepares for bed. As she is showering, a shadowy figure comes in and stabs her to death with a chef's knife. Norman discovers the murder and assumes his mother is responsible. He meticulously cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions—including the embezzled money—into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{received}} general critical acclaim, with critics praising Gaga's singing abilities, the theatricality of the show, and <b>her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{style and}} fashion. The Monster Ball was a commercial success, with sold-out shows {{and demand for}} tickets prompting organizers to add more dates to the itinerary. It ultimately grossed an estimated US$227.4million from 200reported shows and an audience of 2.5million. At the 2010 Billboard Touring Awards, Gaga won the Breakthrough Performer Award, {{as well as the}} Concert Marketing & Promotion Award, the latter being an acknowledgment of her partnership with sponsor Virgin Mobile.

5|$|Welcome to Alflolol (Bienvenue sur Alflolol) brings Laureline's rebellious {{nature to}} the fore; unlike Valérian, {{she has not}} been born and raised by Galaxity and is {{prepared}} not only to question Galaxity's authorities but to rebel openly against them when their orders run contrary to <b>her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> morality. It also demonstrates her impulsive streak; she sides with the native Alflololians against Galaxity and Valérian with no thought for the personal consequences she may have to face herself. Her position as the true star of the series is cemented in Ambassador of the Shadows (L'Ambassadeur des Ombres), which is virtually a solo adventure for her as she searches the vast space station Point Central for the kidnapped Valérian and the Earth Ambassador. Later, when acting as independent agents, it is Laureline who questions the ethics of some of the jobs they are forced to take to make ends meet, notably in The Living Weapons (Les Armes Vivantes).|$|E

25|$|Martineau began losing <b>her</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> {{taste and}} smell at a young age, {{becoming}} increasingly deaf and having to use an ear trumpet. It {{was the beginning of}} many health problems in her life. In 1821 she began to write anonymously for the Monthly Repository, a Unitarian periodical, and in 1823 she published Devotional Exercises and Addresses, Prayers and Hymns.|$|R
5000|$|With time, {{the cancer}} burrowed through her sinuses, nasal cavities, and eye socket, leaving her face {{severely}} disfigured. She also lost <b>her</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> sight, taste, and smell and suffered severe pain that {{she refused to}} relieve with morphine due to its side effects, stating, [...] "drugs are chemicals, chemicals are poison, and I won't make matters worse by poisoning myself." ...|$|R
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains <b>her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E

25|$|In several {{sections}} Murasaki reveals her {{dissatisfaction with}} court life. She describes feelings of helplessness, <b>her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> inadequacy compared to higher-ranked Fujiwara clan relatives and courtiers, and the pervasive loneliness after her husband's death. In doing so, she adds {{a sense of}} self to the diary entries.|$|E
25|$|If {{fertility}} is not {{the primary}} aim, then menstruation can usually be regulated with a contraceptive pill. The purpose of regulating menstruation, in essence, is for the woman's convenience, and perhaps <b>her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> well-being; there is no medical requirement for regular periods, {{as long as they}} occur sufficiently often.|$|E
25|$|The {{killing of}} Monaldeschi in a French palace was legal, since Christina had {{judicial}} rights over {{the members of}} her court, as her vindicator Gottfried Leibniz claimed. As her contemporaries saw it, Christina as queen had to emphasize right and wrong, and <b>her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> duty was strong. She continued to regard herself as queen regnant all her life.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to feminine personality and wardrobe, the series characterized Maggie as extremely loyal {{and the ultimate}} friend. <b>Her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor is brought together by witty one-liners, often relying on such when angry, confrontational, or happy. Somewhat of a risk-taker, the character is frequently known to handle matters her way, no matter the consequence.|$|E
25|$|Soraya was 12 {{years old}} when her mother was first {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer, 18 when her mother had a recurrence, and 22 when her mother died in 1992. Soraya had said that <b>her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> responsibility increased because she needed {{to take care of}} her mother and do all the household chores. She would also accompany her mother to the doctor's office; together they did breast-cancer research and participated in the Race for the Cure.|$|E
25|$|Agnes Mundy: Agnes {{is quiet}} and contemplative, {{knitting}} gloves with Rose whilst also helping {{to keep the}} house in order, along with Maggie. She appears to be silently infatuated with Gerry and is quick to leap to his defence. However, Michael's narratives reveal Agnes' future to be bleak. Her knitting fails to support her when the knitware factory opens. Due to <b>her</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> parental regard for Rose, she immigrates with her to London, breaking off all contact with the family, and dies in dire circumstances in the 1950s.|$|E
