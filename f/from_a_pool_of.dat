5|$|Calabozos lies in an {{area between}} thick and thin {{continental}} crust, and its eruptions are probably fed <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> andesitic and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its caldera.

Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates.|$|E

5|$|The {{differences}} between these two deposits can {{be accounted for by}} a few factors, including time of eruption and placement. The material inside the caldera must be younger and erupted <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> magma that had larger crystals. Its extensive erosion {{can be explained by the}} presence of hydrothermal vents, and its high levels of lithics probably originate from either being exposed to the rocks after they were erupted, lying adjacent to them while they underwent subsidence, or is a result of long, slow formation. Any of these reasons would also effectively account for the poor mixing of the lavas.|$|E
5|$|Benet's band program, {{practically}} nonexistent in {{the late}} 1950s, was revitalized by director Andy Marchese in the mid-1960s, who introduced new uniforms, regularly scheduled concerts, and marching band trophies.
