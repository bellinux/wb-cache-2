25|$|The Indian subcontinent {{has served}} as a stage for intense human and tiger confrontations. The region affording habitat where tigers have {{achieved}} their highest densities is also one which has housed one of the most concentrated and rapidly expanding human populations. At the beginning of the 19th century tigers were so numerous <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> question as to whether man or tiger would survive. It became the official policy to encourage the killing of tigers as rapidly as possible, rewards being paid for their destruction in many localities. The United Provinces supported large numbers of tigers in the submontane Terai region, where man-eating had been uncommon. In {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, marauding tigers began to take a toll of human life. These animals were pushed into marginal habitat, where tigers had formerly not been known, or where they existed only in very low density, by an expanding population of more vigorous animals that occupied the prime habitat in the lowlands, where there was high prey density and good habitat for reproduction. The dispersers had no where else to go, since the prime habitat was bordered in the south by cultivation. They are thought to have followed back the herds of domestic livestock that wintered in the plains when they returned to the hills in the spring, and then being left without prey when the herds dispersed back to their respective villages. These tigers were the old, the young and the disabled. All suffered from some disability, mainly caused either by gunshot wounds or porcupine quills.|$|E

500|$|When Eden succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister in 1955 he {{promoted}} Home to {{the cabinet}} as Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. At {{the time of this}} appointment Home had not been to any of the countries within his ministerial remit, and he quickly arranged to visit Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, India, Pakistan and Ceylon. He {{had to deal with the}} sensitive subject of immigration from and between Commonwealth countries, where a delicate balance had to be struck between resistance in some quarters in Britain and Australia to non-white immigration on the one hand, and on the other the danger of sanctions in India and Pakistan against British commercial interests if discriminatory policies were pursued. In most respects, however, when Home took up the appointment <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> relatively uneventful period in the history of the Commonwealth. The upheaval of Indian independence in 1947 was well in the past, and the wave of decolonising of the 1960s was yet to come. However, it fell to Home to maintain Commonwealth unity during the Suez Crisis in 1956, described by Dutton as [...] "the most divisive in its history to date". Australia, New Zealand and South Africa backed the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt to regain control of the Suez Canal. Canada, Ceylon, India and Pakistan opposed it.|$|E

Chief American Horse’s camp was a rich prize. “It was the season when the wild plums ripen. All the agency Sioux were drifting back to the agencies with their packs full of dried meet, buffalo tongues, fresh and dried buffalo berries, wild cherries, plums and all the staples and dainties which tickled the Indian palate.” [...] The lodges were full of furs and meat, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very rich village.

2500|$|While Iturbide's reign lasted {{less than}} a year, it {{was the result of}} and further defined the {{struggle}} between republican and traditional ideals, not only in Mexico, but also in Europe. For a number of Mexican autonomists, a constitutionally sanctioned monarchy seemed a logical {{solution to the problem of}} creating a new state as <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> compromise between those who pushed for a representative form of government and those who wished to keep Mexico's monarchist traditions. One must keep in mind that a Republican, Federalist government was virtually unheard of, and that for 300 years New Spain had lived in a monarchy. When things are viewed in this light, historian Eric Van Young states that Iturbide's seizure of the crown [...] "seems less cynical and idiosyncratic when it comes along at the end of the independence struggle." [...] However, the rest of the 19th century would be marked by oscillation between the two political extremes, with each side gaining the upper hand at one point or another. The old Mexican nobility kept their titles and coats-of-arms close at hand, ready for a comeback. Members of the Iturbide family intrigued against the Mexican government in Madrid, New York City, Paris, and Rome as late as the 1890s.|$|E
2500|$|Eagles {{defensive}} back Eric Allen ended Washington's possession by intercepting a pass from Mark Rypien on their 46. But in {{what turned out}} to be a critical defensive stand, the Eagles could not move the ball and had to punt. From this point on, Washington took over the game. Faced with third and 9 on his own 33-yard line, Rypien completed a 28-yard pass to receiver Art Monk, and followed it up with a 23-yard completion to running back Earnest Byner. On the next play, his 16-yard touchdown pass to Monk gave the Redskins a 7-6 lead with 5:54 left in the half. Coleman recovered a fumble from Sherman to end the Eagles next drive. Philadelphia's defense forced a punt, but their next drive fared no better as Cunningham was intercepted by Darrell Green at midfield. A few plays later, Byner lost a fumble that turned into a 94-yard touchdown by cornerback Ben Smith. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> repeat of Byner's infamous play known as [...] "The Fumble" [...] in the 1987 AFC Championship Game, but this time it was overturned by replay review, as replays showed Byner was down by contact before the ball came out. Washington kept possession and ended up increasing their lead to 10-6 on a 20-yard Chip Lohmiller field goal.|$|E
