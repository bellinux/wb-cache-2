40|$|This thesis {{includes}} both experimental and theoretical investigations of fluctuation-induced transport phenomena, {{presented in a}} series of nine papers, by studies of the dynamics of cold atoms in dissipative optical lattices. With standard laser cooling techniques about 108 cesium atoms are accumulated, cooled to a few μK, and transferred into a dissipative optical lattice. An optical lattice is a periodic light-shift potential, and in dissipative optical lattice the light field is sufficiently close to resonance for incoherent light scattering to be of importance. This provides the system with a <b>diffusive</b> <b>force,</b> but also with a friction through laser cooling mechanisms. In the dissipative optical lattices the friction and the <b>diffusive</b> <b>force</b> will eventually reach a steady state. At steady state, the thermal energy is low enough, compared to the potential depth, for the atoms to be localized close to the potential minima, but high enough for the atoms to occasionally make inter-well flights. This leads to a Brownian motion of the atoms in the optical lattices. In the normal case these random walks average to zero, leading to a symmetric, isotropic diffusion of the atoms. If the optical lattices are tilted, the symmetry is broken and the diffusion will be biased. This leads to a fluctuation-induced drift of the atoms. In this thesis an investigation of such drifts, for an optical lattice tilted by the gravitational force, is presented. We show that even though the tilt over a potential period is small compared to the potential depth, it clearly affect the dynamics of the atoms, and despite the complex details of the system it can, to a good approximation, be described by the Langevin equation formalism for a particle in a periodic potential. The linear drifts give evidence of stop-and-go dynamics where the atoms escape the potential wells and travel over one or more wells before being recaptured. Brownian motors open the possibility of creating fluctuation-induced drifts in the absence of bias forces, if two requirements are fulfilled: the symmetry has to be broken and the system has to be brought out of thermal equilibrium. By utilizing two distinguishable optical lattices, with a relative spatial phase and unequal transfer rates between them, these requirements can be fulfilled. In this thesis, such a Brownian motor is realized, and drifts in arbitrary directions in 3 D are demonstrated. We also demonstrate a real-time steering of the transport as well as drifts along pre-designed paths. Moreover, we present measurements and discussions of performance characteristics of the motor, and we show that the required asymmetry can be obtained in multiple ways...|$|E

The DE method is based on a regression equation of the {{electrical conductivity}} of the extract of the soil sample at 1 :x soil-water ratio, EC 1 :x, on x. The ECSAT can also be measured automatically using time domain reflectometry (TDR) in the field, when the parameters of two models have to be identified for the soil concerned. The concentrations of exchangeable ions, such as Na+, in the solution in a saturated soil, such as [Na+]SAT, are used as well. They are also determined by the DE method. The physical properties of the field soils of the Pingbu experimental field and the parameters of the two models identified for the typical soil in the field were presented.

40|$|Hazardous natural flows such as snow avalanches, debris-flows, lahars and {{pyroclastic}} flows {{are part}} of a much wider class of granular avalanches, that frequently occur in industrial processes and in our kitchens! Granular avalanches are very efficient at sorting particles by size, with the smaller ones percolating down towards the base and squeezing the larger grains up towards the free-surface, to create inversely-graded layers. This paper provides a short introduction and review of recent theoretical advances in describing segregation and remixing with relatively simple hyperbolic and parabolic models. The derivation from two phase mixture theory is briefly summarized and links are drawn to earlier models of Savage & Lun and Dolgunin & Ukolov. The more complex parabolic version of the theory has a <b>diffusive</b> <b>force</b> that competes against segregation and yields S-shaped steady-state concentration profiles through the avalanche depth, that are able to reproduce results obtained from particle dynamics simulations. Time-dependent exact solutions can be constructed by using the Cole-Hopf transformation to linearize the segregation-remixing equation and the nonlinear surface and basal boundary conditions. In the limit of no diffusion, the theory is hyperbolic and the grains tend to separate out into completely segregated inversely graded layers. A series of elementary problems are used to demonstrate how concentration shocks, expansion fans, breaking waves and the large and small particles paths can be computed exactly using the model. The theory is able to capture the key features of the size distribution observed in stratification experiments, and explains how a large particle rich front is connected to an inversely graded avalanche in the interior. The theory is simple enough to couple it to the bulk flow field to investigate segregation-mobility feedback effects that spontaneously generate self-channelizing leveed avalanches, which can significantly enhance the total run-out distance of geophysical mass flow...|$|E

The freedom of movement of the polymers has a strong effect on their ability to interdigitate, and hence, on diffusive bonding.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{investigation of the}} second law performance of double <b>diffusive</b> <b>forced</b> convection in microreactors with the inclusion of nanofluid and radiation effects. The investigated microreactors consist of a single microchannel, fully filled by a porous medium. The transport of heat and mass are analysed by including the thick walls and a first order, catalytic chemical reaction on the internal surfaces of the microchannel. Two sets of thermal boundary conditions are considered on the external surfaces of the microchannel; (1) constant temperature and (2) constant heat flux boundary condition on the lower wall and convective boundary condition on the upper wall. The local thermal non-equilibrium approach is taken to thermally analyse the porous section of the system. The mass dispersion equation is coupled with the transport of heat in the nanofluid flow through consideration of Soret effect. The problem is analytically solved and illustrations of the temperature fields, Nusselt number, total entropy generation rate and performance evaluation criterion (PEC) are provided.

In this work, we utilized our long-circulating polymeric magnetic nanocarriers, encapsulating increasing amounts of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) in a biocompatible oil carrier, to study the effects of SPION loading and of applied magnetic field strength on magnetic tumor targeting in CT 26 tumor-bearing mice. Under controlled conditions, the in vivo magnetic targeting was quantified and found to be directly proportional to SPION loading and magnetic field strength. Highest SPION loading, however, resulted in a reduced blood circulation time and a plateauing of the magnetic targeting.

The binding affinity between F 1 -JY is found to be approximately 15 - 20 times larger than the corresponding affinity for F 1 -F 1. The number of binding sites of F 1 for attachment to JY is approximately the same for binding F 1 to another F 1 and vary between 10 (5) and 10 (6) ...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{multistage}} numerical modeling {{approach to}} simulate acoustic-wave generation and propagation of an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) is presented. the model assumes a uniform {{static magnetic field}} in a conducting half-space. A meander coil winding situated above the half-space is driven by a transient high-frequency current pulse. the numerically computed eddy currents in the conducting specimen are combined with the static magnetic field to yield spatially and temporally <b>diffusive</b> Lorentz <b>forces</b> which in turn are coupled into the elastic-wave equation. This hyperbolic elastodynamic system is solved for the displacement field vector which gives rise to propagating elastic waves. Numerical transduction results are discussed for a generic two-wire transient EMAT configuration and for an isotropic half-space with electric and acoustic material parameters equivalent to those of aluminum...|$|R
