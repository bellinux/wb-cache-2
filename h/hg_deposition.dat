40|$|AbstractWe {{evaluated}} spatial {{patterns of}} mercury (<b>Hg)</b> <b>deposition</b> through analysis of foliage and forest floor samples from 45 sites across Adirondack Park, NY. Species-specific differences in foliar Hg were evident {{with the lowest}} concentrations found in first-year conifer needles and highest concentrations found in black cherry (Prunus serotina). For foliage and forest floor samples, latitude and longitude were negatively correlated with Hg concentrations, likely because of proximity to emission sources, while elevation {{was positively correlated with}} Hg concentrations. Elemental analysis showed moderately strong, positive correlations between Hg and nitrogen concentrations. The spatial pattern of <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> across the Adirondacks is similar to patterns of other contaminants that originate largely from combustion sources such as nitrogen and sulfur.

40|$|Abstract. Prescribed {{fires are}} likely to re-emit atmospherically {{deposited}} mercury (Hg), and comparison of soil Hg storage in areas affected by prescribed fire to that in similar unburned areas may provide cross-validating estimates of atmospheric <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition.</b> Prescribed fires are common in the southeastern United States (US), a region of relatively high <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> compared {{to the rest of}} the US, and are thus a potentially significant source of re-emitted atmospheric Hg. Accordingly, Hg was determined in soil layers of a prescribed fire experiment in a Florida longleaf pine forest. The Hg deficit in the annually burned forest floor relative to the forest floor unburned for 46 years (0. 180 g ha- ' yr-') aped to within 5 % of an independent estimate of <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> for this site based on a regional monitoring network and computer model (0. 171 g ha- ' yr-I). Consideration of other potential inputs and outputs of Hg suggested that atmospheric deposition was the primary input of Hg to the site. If extrapolated, these results suggest that prescribed fires in the southeastern US mainly re-emit atmospherically deposited Hg and that this re-emission is less than 1 % of total US anthropogenic emissions. However, emissions at other sites may vary due to the possible presence of Hg in underlying geological strata and differences in fire regime and levels of atmospheric <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition...</b>|$|E
40|$|During 2009 – 2010, the State of Florida {{established}} {{a series of}} {{air quality monitoring stations}} to collect data for development of a statewide total maximum daily load (TMDL) for mercury (Hg). At three of these sites, located near Ft. Lauderdale (DVE), Pensacola (OLF), and Tampa Bay (TPA), passive samplers for the measurement of air Hg concentrations and surrogate surfaces for measurement of <b>Hg</b> dry <b>deposition</b> were deployed. While it is known that <b>Hg</b> in wet <b>deposition</b> in Florida is high compared {{to the rest of the}} United States, there is little information on <b>Hg</b> dry <b>deposition.</b> The objectives of the work were to: (1) investigate the utility of passive sampling systems for Hg in an area with low and consistent air concentrations as measured by the Tekran ® mercury measurement system, (2) estimate dry deposition of gaseous oxidized Hg, and (3) investigate potential sources. This paper focuses on Objective 3. All sites were situated within 15 km of 1000 MW electricity generating plants (EGPs) and major highways. Bi-weekly dry deposition and passive sampler Hg uptake were not directly correlated with the automated Tekran ® system measurements, and there was limited agreement between these systems for periods of high deposition. Using diel, biweekly, and seasonal Hg observations, and ancillary data collected at each site, the potential sources of Hg deposited to surrogate surfaces were investigated. With this information, we conclude that there are three major processes/sources contributing to <b>Hg</b> dry <b>deposition</b> in Florida, with these varying as a function of location and time of year. These include: (1) in situ oxidation of locally and regionally derived Hg facilitated by mobile source emissions, (2) indirect and direct inputs of Hg from local EGPs, and (3) direct input of Hg associated with long range transport of air from the northeastern United States. Based on data collected with the surrogate surface sampling system, natural background dry deposition for Florida is estimated to be 0. 03 ng m − 2 h − 1. Deposition associated with mobile sources is 0. 10 ng m − 2 h − 1 at TPA and DVE, and 0. 03 ng m − 2 h − 1 at OLF. Long range transport contributes 0. 8 ng m − 2 h − 1 in the spring. At DVE ~ 0. 10 ng m − 2 h − 1 is contributed directly or indirectly from local point sources. We also suggest based on the data collected with the Tekran ® and passive sampling systems that different chemical forms of GOM are associated with each of these sources...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{comprehensive}} biomonitoring programme should integrate several methods distributed {{along the}} biomonitoring chain, allowing to detect exposure, threads and impacts. In {{the case of}} a municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI), biomonitoring of air pollution can contribute to source attribution, detection of ongoing processes and assessment of environmental effects. Three different methods were used to assess the biological effects of air pollution around a using lichens as biomonitors: (1) lichen diversity; (2) bioaccumulation of trace elements; and (3) physiological status (photosynthetic efficiency, cell membrane damage, viability). The first method takes into account the native lichen flora, while the other two were applied to thalli of the lichen Evernia prunastri transplanted for 6 months in the study area. Lichen diversity and physiological parameters reflected the effects of air pollution around the incinerator and the surrounding industrial area. High frequencies of non-nitrophilous species corresponded to sites with higher environmental quality, while high frequencies of nitrophilous species corresponded to sites with higher level of eutrophication. Transplanted samples showed increased cell membrane damage and reduced vitality respect to control samples. Bioaccumulation of trace elements pointed at the atmospheric origin of <b>Hg</b> <b>depositions</b> in the area. These results suggest that an integrated use of lichen-based methods along the biomonitoring chain can provide useful biological outputs for decision-makers to establish correct sustainable waste management policies...|$|R

However, the nested model overestimates <b>Hg</b> wet <b>deposition</b> over the Ohio River Valley region (ORV) by 27 %.

Over the contiguous US, the correlation coefficient (r) between MDN observations and our IPR simulation increases from 0. 63 to 0. 78. The IPR nested simulation generally reproduces the seasonal cycle in surface concentrations of speciated Hg from the Atmospheric Mercury Network (AMNet) and Canadian Atmospheric Mercury Network (CAMNet).

An extensive monitoring record for wet and dry <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> was compiled for 2001 – 2016, including 4666 weekly precipitation samples at 13 sites and 27 annual litterfall-Hg samples at 7 sites. This study {{is the first to}} examine these Hg data for the Midwestern USA. The median annual precipitation-Hg deposition at the study sites was 10. 4 micrograms per square meter per year (µg/m 2 /year) and ranged from 5. 8 µg/m 2 /year to 15. 0 µg/m 2 /year. The median annual Hg concentration was 9. 4 ng/L. Annual litterfall-Hg deposition had a median of 16. 1 µg/m 2 /year and ranged from 9. 7 to 23. 4 µg/m 2 /year. Isopleth maps of annual precipitation-Hg deposition indicated a recurring spatial pattern similar to one revealed by statistical analysis of weekly precipitation-Hg deposition. In that pattern, high <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> in southeastern Indiana was present each year, frequently extending to southern Illinois. Most of central Indiana and central Illinois had similar <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition.</b> Areas with comparatively lower annual <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> were observed in Michigan and Ohio for many years and frequently included part of northern Indiana. The area in southern Indiana where high <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> predominated had the highest number of extreme episodes of weekly <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> delivering up to 15 % of the annual Hg load from precipitation in a single week. Modeled 48 -h back trajectories indicated air masses for these episodes often arrived from the south and southwest, crossing numerous stationary sources of Hg emissions releasing from 23 to more than 300 kg Hg per year. This analysis suggests that local and regional, rather than exclusively continental or global Hg emissions were likely contributing to the extreme episodes and at least in part, to the spatial patterns of precipitation-Hg deposition in the study area. Statistically significant temporal decreases in weekly precipitation-Hg concentrations in the study area between the periods 2001 – 2013 and 2014 – 2016 were observed, coinciding with reported reductions in Hg emissions in the USA required by implementation of national Hg emissions-control rules. These decreases in atmospheric-Hg concentrations are believed to have resulted in the reduced atmospheric-Hg deposition recorded because precipitation depths between the two periods were not significantly different.

During most of the prehistoric period, atmospheric deposition rates were rather constant {{with an average of}} about 2 microg/m 2 /yr. Peak deposition, ranging from 4 to 6 microg/m 2 /yr, occured at least during two periods between 3, 300 and 3, 600 BP and between 8, 500 to 12, 000 BP, and during the last glacial maximum (LGM), at about 18, 000 years BP. These periods were characterized by drier, colder climates with high frequency of forest fires, as shown by correlation with coal and pollen distribution data. During the colonial period Hg atmospheric deposition rates were much higher, about four times the prehistoric background and reached 6 to 8 microg/m 2 /yr. These increasing <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> rates can only be explained by the large Hg emissions in South and Central America from Spanish silver mines, which emitted to the continent's environment about 200, 000 tons of Hg from 1, 580 to 1, 820. During the present century, <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> rates varied according to the region of the country.

40|$|A {{modelling}} {{study was}} conducted to explore the emission, transport, transformation and deposition behaviour of atmospheric Hg. A detailed natural Hg emission model was developed to estimate the natural Hg emissions from soil, water and vegetation. U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Hg model system was improved by incorporating the detailed treatment of natural Hg emissions, adopting boundary conditions from a global Hg model (Seigneur et al., 2004) and including the calculation of the dry deposition velocity of elemental Hg. The natural Hg emission model and the improved CMAQ-Hg model were validated with some measurements and then applied to North America for a whole year (2002). A detailed natural Hg emission model was developed in this study. This model made use of detailed soil Hg concentration measurements, meteorological data and soil conditions to estimate Hg emissions from soil, water and vegetation. The influence of snow cover and low temperature was also considered in the model. This model was then applied to simulate one-year natural Hg emissions in North America in 2002. The modelled results, compared to some reported natural Hg emission measurements, demonstrated a strong simulation ability. The spatial and temporal variations of emission fluxes were examined through numerical simulations. A pronounced diurnal cycle and a seasonal cycle were found in the emissions from most land uses. Compared with summer, natural Hg emission was significantly limited in winter. Simulation results showed that about 229 metric tons of total natural Hg emission, 1. 8 times anthropogenic Hg emission, was emitted from the simulation domain in 2002. U. S. EPA CMAQ Hg model system was improved and then applied to simulate the emission, transport, transformation and <b>deposition</b> of atmospheric <b>Hg</b> in North America for the year 2002.

The good agreement between them demonstrated the good performance of this improved model in modelling the behaviour of emission, transport, transformation and <b>deposition</b> of atmospheric <b>Hg.</b> Hg budget and net evasion of Hg in North America were also investigated. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effects of emissions, including Hg and non-Hg emissions, on the air concentration and <b>deposition</b> of atmospheric <b>Hg.</b> The results indicated that ambient concentration of TGM was much more sensitive to Hg emissions than non-Hg emissions. Natural Hg emission was more significant than anthropogenic emission to affect ambient concentration of TGM, illustrating natural Hg emission is a key factor influencing TGM ambient concentration. Unlike TGM concentration, <b>Hg</b> dry <b>deposition</b> was not only sensitive to Hg emissions but also to non-Hg emissions such as VOCs and NO x. Anthropogenic Hg emission, natural Hg emission and NO x emission had almost the same effect on total dry <b>deposition</b> of <b>Hg.</b> The results also illustrated that <b>Hg</b> wet <b>deposition</b> was only sensitive to non-Hg emissions such as NO x and VOCs, especially of VOCs emission.

In the heating and non-heating season, Hg concentrations in precipitation were similar. <b>Hg</b> wet <b>deposition</b> flux dominated in summer, when the production of biomass in the aquatic system was able to actively adsorb Hg. Input of metal to the sea was attributed to regional and distant sources. Maritime air masses, through transformation of Hg(0), were an essential vector of mercury in precipitation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new artificial turf surrogate surface (ATSS) sampler for use in the measurement of mercury (<b>Hg)</b> dry <b>deposition.</b> In contrast to many existing surrogate surface designs, the ATSS utilizes a three-dimensional deposition surface that may more closely mimic the physical structure of many natural surfaces than traditional flat surrogate surface designs (water, filter, greased Mylar film). The ATSS has been designed to overcome several complicating factors that can impact the integrity of samples with other direct measurement approaches by providing a passive system which can be deployed for both short and extended periods of time (days to weeks), and is not contaminated by precipitation and/or invalidated by strong winds. Performance characteristics including collocated precision, in-field procedural and laboratory blanks were evaluated. The results of these performance evaluations included a mean collocated precision of 9 %, low blanks (0. 8 ng), high extraction efficiency (97 %– 103 %), and a quantitative matrix spike recovery (100 %) ...|$|R

Calculations were based on a large survey of published and unpublished data on litterfall and Hg concentrations in litterfall samples from the Amazonian region. Litterfall based on 65 sites located in the Amazon rainforest averaged 8. 15  ±  2. 25  Mg ha(- 1)  y(- 1). Average Hg concentrations were calculated from nine datasets for fresh tree leaves and ten datasets for litter, and a median concentration of 60. 5  ng Hg g(- 1) was considered for <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> in litterfall, which averaged 49  ±  14  μg m(- 2)  yr(- 1).

40|$|Establishing mercury (Hg) source-receptor (SR) {{relationship}} matrices {{provides a}} tool to improve {{the understanding of the}} geographic relationship between regions of Hg release and its eventual deposition. SR relationship matrices are therefore a useful starting point for the development of policies aimed at reducing the impact of Hg emissions from anthropogenic activities (Hganthr) on sensitive ecosystems and areas potentially at risk of Hg contamination. A global Chemical Transport Model (CTM) has been used to simulate the emission, transport and fate of Hganthr from 12 source regions, considering a range of uncertainty in the modelled chemical and physical processes. This ensemble of simulations gives an estimate of the <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> which derives from each source region, as well as an estimate of the uncertainty of the calculated deposition flux. The uncertainty has been calculated using the bootstrap method to estimate this uncertainty in terms of the normalised confidence interval amplitude of the mean (NCIAM). Within the calculated confidence ranges, for almost all regions the contribution to the <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> flux from remote sources is greater than that from domestic sources. Europe and South Asia, where the contributions are statistically indistinguishable, are exceptions, as is East Asia, with local sources dominating the <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> flux. East Asia {{is the single most important}} remote source region for most receptor regions. The results yield such high uncertainties in the deposition flux for many receptor regions that the results are unlikely to be taken into consideration by policy makers. This uncertainty is particularly relevant when considering the “domestic” contribution to regional deposition, highlighting the need for more studies to resolve remaining uncertainties in the atmospheric Hg cycle, and Hganthr emission inventories...|$|E
40|$|A {{long-term}} mining history {{introduced a}} series of environmental problems in Wanshan Hg mining area, Guizhou, China. The spatial distribution of gaseous elemental Hg (Hg 0 ) concentrations in ambient air were investigated using RA- 915 + Zeeman Mercury Analyzer during day time and night time in May 2010, which showed that calcines and mine wastes piles located at Dashuixi and on-going artisanal Hg mining activities at Supeng were major sources of atmospheric mercury in Wanshan Hg mining area. Meanwhile, both precipitation and throughfall samples were collected weekly at Shenchong, Dashuixi, and Supeng from May 2010 to May 2011, respectively. Our data showed that the concentrations of different Hg species varied with a large range, and the annual volume-weighted mean total mercury (THg) concentrations in precipitation and throughfall samples were 502. 6 ng L− 1 and 977. 8 ng L− 1 at Shenchong, 814. 1 ng L− 1 and 3392. 1 ng L− 1 at Dashuixi, 7490. 1 ng L− 1 and 9641. 5 ng L− 1 at Supeng, respectively. Besides, THg concentrations in all throughfall samples were 1 – 7 folds higher than those in precipitation samples.

40|$|Atmospheric mercury (Hg) is a toxic {{pollutant}} and can {{be transported}} over the whole globe due to its long lifetime in the atmosphere. For the purpose of assessing Hg hemispheric transport and better characterizing regional Hg pollution, a global nested atmospheric Hg transport model (GNAQPMS-Hg – Global Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System for Hg) has been developed. In GNAQPMS-Hg, the gas- and aqueous-phase Hg chemistry representing the transformation among three forms of Hg: elemental mercury (Hg(0)), divalent mercury (Hg(II)), and primary particulate mercury (Hg(P)) are calculated. A {{detailed description of the}} model, including mercury emissions, gas- and aqueous-phase chemistry, and dry and wet deposition is given in this study. Worldwide observations including extensive data in China have been collected for model evaluation. Comparison results show that the model reasonably simulates the global mercury budget and the spatiotemporal variation of surface mercury concentrations and deposition. Overall, model predictions of annual total gaseous mercury (TGM) and wet deposition agree with observations within a factor of 2, and within a factor of 5 for oxidized mercury and dry deposition. The model performs significantly better in North America and Europe than in East Asia. This can probably be attributed to the large uncertainties in emission inventories, coarse model resolution and to the inconsistency between the simulation and observation periods in East Asia. Compared to the global simulation, the nested simulation shows improved skill at capturing the high spatial variability of surface <b>Hg</b> concentrations and <b>deposition</b> over East Asia. In particular, the root mean square error (RMSE) of simulated <b>Hg</b> wet <b>deposition</b> over East Asia is reduced by 24 % in the nested simulation. Model sensitivity studies indicate that Chinese primary anthropogenic emissions account for 30 and 62 % of surface mercury concentrations and deposition over China, respectively. Along the rim of the western Pacific, the contributions from Chinese sources are 11 and 15. 2 % over the Korean Peninsula, 10. 4 and 8. 2 % over Southeast Asia, and 5. 7 and 5. 9 % over Japan.

Measurements of Hg fluxes were performed during middayperiods using the ORNL Teflon dynamic flux chamber. Mean Hg emission fluxes were 1. 4 ± 0. 3 – 2. 4 ± 1. 0 ng m - 2 hr - 1 for three shaded forest sites and 7. 6 ± 1. 7 ng m - 2 hr - 1 for an open field site. <b>Hg</b> dry <b>deposition</b> was observed at a heavily shaded forest site overwet soils (mean = – 0. 3 ± 0. 2 ng m - 2 hr - 1). Theoverall mean Hg flux was 1. 4 ± 1. 4 ng m - 2 hr - 1 for the four shaded forest sites. The Hg fluxes observed at these sites are similar to those found at other northern background sites. Significant, rapid response of Hg emission to solar radiation was observed over these background soils. Artificial irrigation over these soils induced immediate andmeasurable increases in Hg emission.

Our results showed that HG activated AKT signaling pathway, followed by an increase in PPARγ that induced CD 36 overexpression, ultimately causing lipid deposition in HK- 2 cells. We also found that inhibition of AKT-PPARγ signaling pathway or knockdown of CD 36 could reduce HG-induced lipid accumulation in HK- 2 cells. These results indicated that AKT-PPARγ signaling pathway mediated HG-induced lipid deposition by upregulating CD 36 expression in HK- 2 cells and that inhibition of AKT-PPARγ signaling pathway had the potential beneficial effects of reducing lipid deposition in diabetic kidney...|$|R

This study utilizes three recent biomass burning inventories (FINNv 1. 0, GFEDv 3. 1, and GFASv 1. 0) and the global Hg chemistry model, ECHMERIT, to investigate the annual variation of Hg emissions, and the geographical distribution and magnitude of the resulting <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> fluxes.

Deposition flux distributions proved to be more sensitive to the emission inventory and the oxidation mechanism chosen, than all the other model parametrizations. Over 75 % of Hg emitted from biomass burning is deposited to the world’s oceans, with the highest fluxes predicted in the North Atlantic and the highest total deposition in the North Pacific.

40|$|The {{legacy of}} {{long-term}} mining activities in Wanshan mercury (Hg) mining area (WMMA), Guizhou, China including {{a series of}} environmental issues related to Hg pollution. The spatial distribution of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg 0) concentrations in ambient air were monitored using a mobile RA- 915 + Zeeman Mercury Analyzer during daytime and night time in May 2010. The data imply that calcines and mine wastes piles located at Dashuixi and on-going artisanal Hg mining activities at Supeng were major sources of atmospheric mercury in WMMA. For a full year (May 2010 to May 2011), sampling of precipitation and throughfall were conducted {{on a weekly basis}} at three sites (Shenchong, Dashuixi, and Supeng) within WMMA. Hg in deposition was characterized by analysis of total Hg (THg) and dissolved Hg (DHg) concentrations. The corresponding data exhibit a high degree of variability, both temporarily and spatially. The volume-weighted mean THg concentrations in precipitation and throughfall samples were 502. 6 ng l − 1 and 977. 8 ng l − 1 at Shenchong, 814. 1 ng l − 1 and 3392. 1 ng l − 1 at Dashuixi, 7490. 1 ng l − 1 and 9641. 5 ng l − 1 at Supeng, respectively. THg was enhanced in throughfall compared to wet deposition samples by up to a factor of 7.

[Hg] tot in C. sativa was greatest on Etna's SE flank reflecting <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition</b> from the typically overhead volcanic plume. [Hg] tot also showed Hg accumulation over the growing season, increasing with leaf age and recent eruptive activity. [Hg] tot in C. sativa was not controlled by [Hg] tot in soils, which instead was greatest on Etna's NW flank, and was correlated with the proportion of organic matter in the soil (% Org). An elevated [Hg] tot/% Org ratio in soils on Etna's SE flank is indicative of increased <b>Hg</b> <b>deposition.</b> This ratio was also found to decrease with local soil pH, suggesting that Hg deposited to the low pH and organic-poor soils on Etna's SE flank may not be retained but will instead be released to groundwater or re-emitted to the atmosphere.

In this study, a comprehensive model performance evaluation for the full year of 2002 is performed {{for the first time}} for CMAQ-MP using the surface networks and satellite measurements. CMAQ-MP shows a comparable and improved performance for most CAPs species as compared to an older version of CMAQ that did not treat HAPs and used older versions of na-tional emission inventories. CMAQ-MP generally gives better performance for CAPs than for HAPs. Max 8 -h ozone (O 3) mixing ratios are well reproduced in the O 3 season. The seasonal-mean performance is fairly good for fine particu-late matter (PM 2. 5), sulfate, and mercury (<b>Hg)</b> wet <b>deposition</b> and worse for other CAPs and HAPs species.

40|$|China {{presently}} contributes {{the largest}} amount of anthropogenic mercury (Hg) emission {{into the atmosphere}} in the world. Over the past decade, numerous studies have been conducted to characterize the concentration and forms of atmospheric Hg in China, which provide insights into the spatial and temporal distributions of atmospheric Hg through ground-based measurements at widely diverse geographical locations and during cruise and flight campaigns. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the state of understanding in atmospheric Hg in China. Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) and particulate-bound mercury (PBM) measured at the remote sites in China are substantially elevated compared to the background values in the Northern Hemisphere. In Chinese urban areas, the highly elevated GEM, PBM and gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) were mainly derived from local anthropogenic Hg emissions, whereas regional anthropogenic emissions and long-range transport from domestic source regions are the primary causes of the elevated GEM and PBM concentrations at remote sites. Using 7 – 9 years of continuous observations at a remote site and an urban site, a slight increase in atmospheric GEM (2. 4 – 2. 5 % yr − 1) was identified (paired samples test: p < 0. 01), which is in agreement with the increasing domestic anthropogenic emissions. Anthropogenic GEM emission quantity in China estimated through the observed GEM / CO concentration ratios ranged from 632 to 1138 t annually over the past decade, 2 – 3 times larger than published values using emission activity data. Modeling results and filed measurements show dry deposition is the predominant process for removing Hg from the atmosphere, 2. 5 – 9. 0 times larger than wet deposition, due to the elevated atmospheric GEM and PBM concentrations that facilitate dry deposition to terrestrial landscapes. Further studies to reconcile the observed and simulated Hg concentrations, to understand the impact of domestic emission reduction on <b>Hg</b> concentration and <b>deposition</b> and to delineate the role of <b>Hg</b> emission and <b>deposition</b> of China in the global Hg biogeochemical cycle, are needed...|$|R
