40|$|It {{is shown}} through a {{detailed}} calculation that in strained layers grown along arbitrary crystallographic directions, the strain components {{can be determined}} from oblique transmission experiments. The analysis {{is based on the}} <b>elasto-optical</b> <b>effect.</b> Electro-optical contributions due to piezoelectric fields are also considered. Specific examples are treated in detail...|$|E
40|$|A {{depressed}} cladding waveguide with record low loss of 0. 12 dB/cm is inscribed in YAG:Nd(0. 3 at. %) crystal by femtosecond laser pulses with an elliptical beam waist. The waveguide is formed {{by a set}} of parallel tracks which constitute the {{depressed cladding}}. It is a key element for compact and efficient CW waveguide laser operating at 1064 nm and pumped by a multimode laser diode. Special attention is paid to mechanical stress resulting from the inscription process. Numerical calculation of mode distribution and propagation loss with the <b>elasto-optical</b> <b>effect</b> taken into account leads {{to the conclusion that the}} depressed cladding is a dominating factor in waveguide mode formation, while the mechanical stress only slightly distorts waveguide modes...|$|E
40|$|Single {{tracks and}} pairs of tracks were written into undoped and Nd-doped YAG {{crystals}} using a commercial femtosecond laser system delivering pulses with pulse duration of 140 fs and pulse energies up to 10 mu J. The pulses were focused by a 50 x microscope objective {{below the surface}} of the crystals. Due to the <b>elasto-optical</b> <b>effect,</b> stress-induced birefringence was observed in domains surrounding the single tracks and between the pairs of tracks. Waveguiding was demonstrated in certain channels in these domains. To investigate the underlying guiding mechanism highly selective chemical etching of the modified material was performed with etching rates up to 5 mu m/h. Pumped at 808 nm, laser operation at a wavelength of 1064 nm was achieved. The maximum output power was 25. 5 mW at 261 mW of launched pump power with a slope efficiency of 23 %...|$|E
40|$|Poled {{nonlinear}} optical polymers are molecular dipole electrets {{and must}} therefore exhibit pyro- and piezoelectricity. As a complement to pyroelectrical techniques, piezoelectrical investigations may offer additional possibilities for {{looking into the}} physical mechanisms of various effects found in poled polymers. First results of ongoing piezoelectrical experiments are described and discussed. In particular, the direct and the inverse piezoelectric responses of nonlinear optical guest-host and side-chain polymers were obtained from acousto-electric and interferometric measurements, respectively. This research may eventually shed new light on more fundamental aspects such as e. g. indirect contributions to the electro-optical response in poled polymers {{as well as on}} more practical features such as the application of piezo- and <b>elasto-optical</b> <b>effects</b> in polymer-waveguide devices...|$|R
40|$|In SNAP (Surface {{nanoscale}} axial photonics) resonators {{propagation of}} a slow {{whispering gallery mode}} along an optical fiber is controlled by nanoscale variation of the effective radius of the fiber [1]. Similar behavior can be realized in so - called nanobump microresonators in which the introduced variation of the effective radius is asymmetric, i. e. depends on the axial coordinate [2]. The possibilities of realization of such structures “on the fly” in an optical fiber by applying external electrostatic fields to it is discussed in this work. It is shown that local variations in effective radius of the fiber and in its refractive index caused by external electric fields can {{be large enough to}} observe SNAP structure - like behavior in an originally flat optical fiber. Theoretical estimations of the introduced refractive index and effective radius changes and results of finite element calculations are presented. Various effects are taken into account: electromechanical (piezoelectricity and electrostriction), electro-optical (Pockels and Kerr effects) and <b>elasto-optical</b> <b>effect.</b> Different initial fibre cross-sections are studied. The aspects of use of linear isotropic (such as silica) and non-linear anisotropic (such as lithium niobate) materials of the fiber are discussed. REFERENCES [1] M. Sumetsky, J. M. Fini, Opt.

40|$|Alkali halides {{containing}} substitutional OH- ions {{have become}} prominent and well investigated examples and model systems for paraelectric and paraelastic crystal substances. Controlled doping between 10 - 6 and 10 - 2 allows {{the study of}} both interaction-free and interacting dipole systems with various experimental techniques. Here the optical and caloric techniques are reviewed. The basis for electro-optical and elasto-optical work is a detailed knowledge of the optical absorption itself. This is reviewed first, covering the electronic (~ 6 eV), vibrational (~ 0. 45 eV) and the recently discovered direct librational absorption (~ 0. 04 eV) of the OH- center. The electro- and <b>elasto-optical</b> <b>effect</b> (change of optical absorption under applied electric and elastic fields) reveals for most investigated cases that the dipoles are confined to the directions by the octahedral crystalline potential. Values for the effective electric and elastic dipole moment and the optical anisotropy of the center are obtained from these experiments. Using the electro-caloric effect and varying the rise- and decaytime of the applied electric field, the dipole-lattice relaxation time can be directly measured. Recent experiments on six different alkali halides show a considerable dependence of this relaxation time on the host lattice, varying between 2 × 10 - 5 and 2 × 10 - 9 sec at 2 °K. From the field- and temperature-dependence of the dipole-lattice relaxation time, conclusion can be drawn about the coupling mechanism between dipole and phonons. Interaction effects among concentrated OH- dipole systems and among systems of diluted OH- dipoles and charged point defects (Frenkel pairs) were quantitatively studied, using the electro- and elasto-optical {{as well as the}} electro-caloric technique...|$|E
