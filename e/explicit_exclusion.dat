5|$|The Flavian {{approach}} to government {{was one of}} both implicit and <b>explicit</b> <b>exclusion.</b> When Vespasian returned to Rome in mid-70, he immediately embarked {{on a series of}} efforts to consolidate his power and prevent future revolts. He offered gifts to the military and dismissed or punished those soldiers loyal to Vitellius. He also restructured the Senatorial and Equestrian orders, removing his enemies and adding his allies. Executive control was largely distributed among members of his family. Non-Flavians were virtually excluded from important public offices, even those who had been among Vespasian's earliest supporters during the civil war. Mucianus slowly disappears from the historical records during this time, and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77. That it was Vespasian's intention to found a long-lasting dynasty to govern the Roman Empire was most evident in the powers he conferred upon his eldest son Titus. Titus shared tribunician power with his father, received seven consulships, the censorship, and perhaps most remarkably, was given command of the Praetorian Guard. Because Titus effectively acted as co-emperor with his father, no abrupt change in Flavian policy occurred during his brief reign from 79 until 81.|$|E

40|$|Background: Although {{observational}} {{data show}} social {{characteristics such as}} gender or socio-economic status to be strong predictors of health, their impact is seldom investigated in randomised controlled studies (RCTs). Objective & design: Using {{a random sample of}} recent RCTs from high-impact journals, we examined how the most often recorded social characteristic, sex/gender, is considered in design, analysis, and interpretation. Of 712 RCTs published from September 2008 to 31 December 2013 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal, Lancet, Canadian Medical Association Journal, or New England Journal of Medicine, we randomly selected 57 to analyse funding, methods, number of centres, documentation of social circumstances, inclusion/exclusion criteria, proportions of women/men, and reporting about sex/gender in analyses and discussion. Results: Participants’ sex was recorded in most studies (52 / 57). Thirty-nine percent included men and women approximately equally. Overrepresentation of men in 43 % of studies without <b>explicit</b> <b>exclusions</b> for women suggested interference in selection processes. The minority of studies that did analyse sex/gender differences (22 %) did not discuss or reflect upon these, or dismissed significant findings. Two studies reinforced traditional beliefs about women's roles, finding no impact of breastfeeding on infant health but nevertheless reporting possible benefits. Questionable methods such as changing protocols mid-study, having undefined exclusion criteria, allowing local researchers to remove participants from studies, and suggesting possible benefit where none was found were evident, particularly in industry-funded research. Conclusions: Social characteristics like sex/gender remain hidden from analyses and interpretation in RCTs, with loss of information and embedding of error all along the path from design to interpretation, and therefore, to uptake in clinical practice. Our results suggest that to broaden external validity, in particular, more refined trial designs and analyses that account for sex/gender and other social characteristics are needed...|$|R

An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was used to study Section Four of the exclusionary clause of Specific Learning Disability (SLD) that states students must be excluded from identification if their learning difficulties are primarily the result of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage. The Contextual Interaction Theory (CIT) was borrowed from water governance policy analysis to provide a theoretical framework for better understanding the complexity of context and interaction processes in special education policy implementation in Oregon. Survey (n = 100) and interview (n = 6) results showed that 87 % of Oregon school psychologist respondents demonstrated some level of non-compliant behavior on Section Four implementation. Barriers to implementation included unclear state and federal guidelines, lack of measurable terms, unclear roles and responsibilities, external pressures to find students eligible, and lack of confidence that Section Four can be applied in every case for 69 % or more of the sample. Recommendations for future research include defining the Section Four terms, developing a measurement tool with cut offs, and training to improve implementation; however, there is concern that this may be an impossible task. Recommendations were made to develop a state level Task Force to begin the dialogue; however, future research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of validity of CIT, definitions of Section Four terms that are measurable, identification and definitions of the mitigating mechanisms in the determination of Section Four for appropriate and possible implementation.

This type of discrimination certainly exists, but it is in no way justified by the presence of evolved prejudices. However, discriminate sociality {{is an integral part of}} group living, as different individuals afford different threats and opportunities. For instance, indiscriminate cooperation is inherently unstable because it is easily invaded by cheats and free-riders. Thus, cooperative groups cannot exist without mechanisms to recognize and punish non-cooperators. Indiscriminate association in other domains, such as pathogen avoidance and intergroup conflict, has similar consequences, and indiscriminate social actors will generally have lower fitness than those who are able to respond functionally to the affordances of others.|$|E

40|$|A person-centred counsellor’s use of self {{may be seen}} {{to include}} {{offering}} a non-possessive, and certainly non-sexual, love. For any practitioner, the question arises as to what underpins conformance to professional codes of ethics, both theoretically and personally. Generally, counselling approaches align with professional prohibitions against sexual activity through some combination of predefined techniques and <b>explicit</b> theoretical <b>exclusion.</b> The person-centred approach avoids the systematic use of techniques and the theory might be considered less explicit, and so maybe demands careful consideration. This research thus considers the underpinning which supports how a therapist can trust themselves not {{to fall in love}} with clients, and not to engage in any form of sexual exploitation. The research addresses self-trust through a highly reflexive, heuristic exploration of a therapist’s fundamental beliefs. These are discussed in relation to literature on ethics and to counselling theory. What emerges is a greater separation between falling in love and sexual exploitation, supporting a therapist’s ability not to engage in unethical activity with clients and opening the way to greater discussion of such concerns within the person-centred arena...|$|R

40|$|The Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA) {{was enacted}} by Congress in 1990 {{in order to}} bring our laws into {{compliance}} with Article 6 bis of the Berne Convention and to acknowledge that protecting moral rights will foster “a climate of artistic worth and honor that encourages the author in the arduous act of creation. ” The passage of this legislation is said to show Congress’s “belief that the art covered by the Act ‘meet[s] a special societal need, and [its] protection and preservation serves an important public interest. ’” Notwithstanding these lofty statements about artistic worth, honor and encouraging creation, VARA is a narrowly drafted addition to the Copyright Act. This legislation recognized several moral rights in the United States for the first time, but it does not extend to all works of authorship. It protects only a very select group of artists and only very narrowly defined works. As enacted well over twenty years ago VARA might have fulfilled initially our nation’s obligations under Article 6 bis of the Berne Convention even though it provides less protection than most European moral rights legislation. It has been called weak, anemic and insufficient. As interpreted and applied by the courts since 1991, it is now reasonable to conclude that VARA has not come close to fulfilling our obligations under Article 6 bis. The federal judiciary, at both the trial and appellate levels, has taken seriously the statute’s restrictive language, its <b>explicit</b> <b>exclusions</b> from coverage, and the legislative history’s emphasis on VARA’s limited scope. In addition, severe tensions between an artist’s moral rights and the defendant’s rights, particularly property rights, have been palpable in many of the cases brought under VARA. As a consequence, courts have shown great reluctance to permit an artist’s moral rights to prevail over a defendant’s rights. Successful reported VARA claims seem to be few and far between. This article, after summarizing VARA’s provisions, presents a pre-VARA moral rights case that might come out much differently if it were litigated today. This hypothetical case highlights many of the issues raised by VARA. Subsequent sections of the article analyze the act’s narrow definition of works of visual art as well as its several limitations on the attribution and integrity rights. These are the key provision which have been interpreted and applied by the courts since VARA’s passage in 1990. Time after time the courts have applied this narrowly drawn statute to deny plausible moral right...|$|R

Results suggest explicit rationing has continued to spread, but the focus has shifted from exclusions of whole treatments from NHS provision towards a reconciliation of implicit and explicit approaches. There is growing interest in explicit criteria to guide decision making, within which clinicians exercise discretion in individual cases. The market contributed to the growth in explicit rationing, notably by decoupling healthcare purchasers (health authorities and GP fundholders) and providers (hospital and community health services) from their previously shared responsibility to manage resources. However, other factors have been influential, especially concern to control rising expenditure. Having originally prompted more <b>explicit</b> decisions (especially <b>exclusions),</b> resource pressures are now rekindling interest in fixed provider budgets and implicit clinical decision making.

40|$|Growing {{opportunities}} for academic scientists to commercialize their science {{has led to}} a new commercial marketplace. Recent evidence suggests that “commercial science ” participation is characterized by gender stratification. Using interviews with life science faculty at one high-status university we examine the mechanisms that instituted, reinforced, and reduced the gender gap in commercial science between 1975 and 2005. We find gender differences from processes on both the demand—(opportunity) and supply—(interest) sides; of deeper significance are the intersections between these sides of the market. Specifically, <b>explicit</b> early <b>exclusion</b> of women left them with fewer opportunities in the marketplace, weakening their socialization and skills in commercial science. This uneven opportunity structure left senior/mid-career women with fewer chances to confront the ambiguities of this new practice, resulting in their greater ambivalence. Gender differences remain significant among junior faculty but we find their decline prompted by greater gender-equality in advisor mentoring and the presence of institutional support which together have started to reshape the supply-side of commercial science. 1. The gender gap in commercial science 1. 1 The rise of commercial science Many academic research projects are characterized by the production of dual-purpose knowledge—knowledge that is simultaneously valuable as a scientific discovery and as a useful, inventive construct (Stokes, 1997; Biagioli, 2000; Murray, 2002; Murray and Stern, 2006). Such knowledge offers opportunities in two distinct markets. The first is the traditional academic science marketplace in which individuals use their knowledge to garner priority and prestige through publication, peer-review and participation in scientific conferences (Merton, 1973; Dasgupta and David, 1994). The second is the pursuit of the practical and commercial aspects of their knowledge in the “commercial science ” marketplace. While these dual option...|$|R

Irrespective of the wording, specific prohibitions which focus on the conduct of the victim are unrealistic in that they fail to account for the multitudinous and interconnected nature of loss of control/provocation claims. Nevertheless, exclusionary conduct models which concentrate on the conduct of the victim ought to be distinguished from clauses which focus on the defendant's actions. If the defendant undertakes to cause the victim to respond in a manner for the purpose of providing an excuse to use violence it is clear that the defence ought not to apply. Similarly, where a defendant becomes voluntarily intoxicated, it may be appropriate to exclude that intoxication from consideration when making the objective assessment as to whether an ordinary/reasonable person would have reacted as the defendant did in the circumstances.
