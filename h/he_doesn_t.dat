40|$|Conquanto a expectativa comum da igreja cristã seja a ressurreição dos mortos para redenção plena dos que crêem em Cristo, entre os grupos católico-romano e protestante-reformado há divergência sobre o que ocorre durante o estado intermediário. O católico-romano crê nas doutrinas do purgatório e da intercessão pelos mortos razão pela qual reza para que a Santa Maria interceda na hora da morte e entrega-se a São José, o padroeiro da boa morte; participa da eucaristia, dá esmola, pratica obras de misericórdia, faz orações e oferece sufrágios em benefício das almas no purgatório; reza para que as almas {{dos santos}} defuntos intercedam por eles diante de Deus; louva à virgem Maria como a primeira, dentre todos os remidos, a ser ressuscitada dentre os mortos; e pratica boas obras para atenuar sua situação no dia do juízo final (em razão de crerem que a salvação é alcançada pela fé em Cristo e pelas boas obras). O protestante-reformado crê que enquanto a alma do justo está gozando da comunhão com Cristo, a alma do ímpio está sofrendo afastada de Cristo. Essa situação é temporária, pois ambos aguardam a ressurreição dos mortos e julgamento final para que tanto o justo possa desfrutar da salvação integralmente (no corpo e na alma) assim como o ímpio possa receber o justo juízo integralmente (no corpo e na alma) razão pela qual não intercede pelos mortos (nem mesmo tem o hábito de visitar os túmulos) e nem pede a intercessão dos santos defuntos; não pratica boas obras com vistas à salvação (nem mesmo procura ocasião para as boas obras); não pratica a extrema unção (mas evangeliza o moribundo no leito da morte); e mantém uma visão polarizada do status pós-morte: céu ou inferno. O cristão protestante-reformado tem a firme convicção de sua salvação (conforme doutrina da perseverança dos santos). Essa é a razão pela qual enfrenta serenamente o luto e a idéia de sua própria morte. Although the expectative common of the Christian church is the resurrection ofthe dead for the {{absolute}} redemption {{of those who}} have faith in Christ, among the catholic-roman and protestant-reformed groups there is divergence about what happens during the intermediate state. The catholic-roman has the faith in the doctrine of the purgatory and interception for the dead reason for the which pray for Mary, Jesus Christ mother s, to intercede in the hour of the death and surrenders himself to St. Joseph, the patron of the good death; he participles of the Sacrament of Eucharist, gives alms, practices mercy works, makes prayers and offers suffrage in benefit of the souls of the purgatory; he prays for souls of the dead saints intercede to him before God; he praises to the virgin Mary as the first, among the redeemed, to be resurrected among the dead s; and he practices good works to attenuate his situation in the day of the final judgment (in reason of believe that the salvation is reached by the faith in Christ and the good woks). The protestant-reformed believes that while the soul of the fair is enjoying of the communion with Christ, the heretic s soul is suffering faraway from Christ. That situation is temporary, because both wait for the resurrection of the dead and the final judgment in order to the fair can to enjoy of the salvation integrally (in the body and in the soul) and heretic can to receive the fair judgment integrally (in the body and in the soul) reason for the which doesn t intercede for the dead s (not even has the habit of visiting the graves) and nor asks for the dead saint s intercession; <b>he</b> <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> practice good works with views the salvation (not even look for occasion for the good works); <b>he</b> <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> practice the extreme unction (but evangelizes the dying in the bed of death); and he maintains a polarized vision of the status powder-death: heaven or hell. The protestant-reformed Christian has the firm conviction of his salvation (according to doctrine of the saint s perseverance). That is the reason for which calmly faces the mourning and the idea of his own death...|$|E
40|$|O processo de abertura {{comercial}} e de flexibilização da conta capital, iniciado nos anos 1990, aliado à adoção de um regime de câmbio flutuante a partir {{de janeiro}} de 1999, fizeram da taxa de câmbio uma das principais variáveis econômicas brasileiras. Diante disso, este trabalho analisou os impactos de variações na taxa de câmbio sobre as demais variáveis econômicas como taxa interna de juros, exportações líquidas, preços internos e valor da produção. Isso se torna ainda mais interessante quando é levado em consideração que no período da análise, de janeiro de 1999 a março de 2007, vigorou um regime de câmbio flutuante. Os resultados apresentados pelas políticas monetária e fiscal nesse regime seriam significativamente diferenciados aos que ocorreriam em um regime de câmbio controlado, que vigorou, praticamente, nos últimos cinqüenta anos na economia brasileira. Contudo, o mercado cambial brasileiro pode apresentar alguns vieses que seriam gerados, por exemplo, pela existência de um prêmio de risco cambial significativamente volátil, a ocorrência de erros e/ou desvios das expectativas racionais e a desconsideração da simultaneidade entre a taxa interna de juros e a taxa de câmbio. Sendo assim, verificou-se a existência de cada um desses vieses, concluindo que apenas o viés de simultaneidade ocorreu no período. Esse resultado, aliado ao de que os agentes do mercado de câmbio brasileiro formam suas expectativas racionalmente, possibilitou concluir que, ao considerar a simultaneidade entre a taxa de câmbio e a taxa interna de juros, o mercado cambial brasileiro estaria sendo eficiente no período analisado. Para eliminar o viés de simultaneidade foi utilizada a metodologia de equações simultâneas, valendo-se do estimador de Mínimos Quadrados em Dois Estágios (MQ 2 E). Em suma, o resultado referente à verificação de viés no mercado de câmbio possibilitou concluir que o prêmio de rico cambial existe, no período da análise, mas, ele não varia significativamente a ponto de influenciar a determinação da taxa de câmbio. Além disso, não foi possível rejeitar a hipótese de que os agentes do mercado de câmbio agem de forma racional. Mesmo ocorrendo intervenções governamentais nesse mercado, comprovado pela estimativa de um índice de intervenção para período analisado, as informações referentes à essas intervenções foram assimiladas pelos agentes de modo a eliminar esse viés. Restou apenas o viés de simultaneidade, eliminado pela estimação por MQ 2 E. Incorporando a informação da simultaneidade, foi estimado um modelo monetário contendo as equações da paridade descoberta dos juros, do equilíbrio no mercado de moeda e de bens, da paridade do poder de compra e das exportações líquidas, para o período de janeiro de 1999 a março de 2007. A partir daí foram realizadas simulações que possibilitaram concluir que variações na taxa de câmbio afetam significativamente o nível da taxa interna de juros, das exportações líquidas e, consequentemente, da produção brasileira. Além disso, foi possível observar que as políticas monetárias, representada por variações na taxa de juros, tiveram maior influência sobre a produção do que políticas fiscais. O trabalho possibilitou verificar também que, embora as exportações líquidas tenha sido a grande responsável pelo crescimento da economia brasileira no período, seus efeitos foram praticamente anulados pelas altas taxas de juros praticadas e, que pequenas reduções nos juros internos são capazes de gerar um estímulo consideravelmente maior sobre o crescimento da produção, se comparado com variações de mesma magnitude sobre as exportações líquidas. The process of commercial opening and flexible of capital account, {{started in the}} 1990 s, ally {{to the adoption of}} a regimen of floating change, since of January of 1999 and transformed the tax of change in one of the main Brazilian economic variables. Faced with that, this work analyzed the impacts of variations in the tax of change on the other economic variables as interest rates internal, liquid exportations, internal prices, and value of the production. It becomes more interesting, when it s considered that in the period of analyze of January of 1999 to March of 2007, invigorated a regimen of floating change. The results presented by the political monetary, and fiscal in that regimen would be differentiated to the others that would occur in a regimen of controlled change, that invigorated, practically, in the last fifty years in the Brazilian economy. However, the Brazilian exchange market can present some bias that would be generated, for example, by the existence of a prize of significantly volatile exchange risk, the occurrence of error and shunting of the rational expectations and the simultaneity between the interest rates internal and the tax of change. Send asset, it was verified the existence of each one of those bias, concluding that only of the simultaneity bias occurred in the period. The result, ally to the agents of the market of Brazilian change form his expectations rationally, and it was possible to conclude that the consideration of the simultaneity between the tax of change and the interest rates internal, the Brazilian exchange market would be being efficient in the period analyzed. To eliminate of the simultaneity bias, was utilized the methodology of simultaneous equations considering the Two-Stage Least Squares Estimator. In short, the result that refers to the verification of the bias in the market of change enabled to conclude that the prize of exchange risk exists, in the period of analyze, but <b>he</b> <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> vary significantly to the point to influence the determination of the tax of change. And it wasn t possible reject the hypothesis that the agents of the market of change act in a rational way. Still occurring governmental interventions in that market, verified by the estimate of an index of intervention for period analyzed, the information that refer to those interventions were assimilated by the agents in a way to eliminate this bias. It was remained only the simultaneity bias that was eliminated by the estimation by Two-Stage Least Squares. Incorporating the information of simultaneously, it was estimated a monetary model containing the equations of parity discovered by the interest, of the equilibrium in the market of currency, and property, of the parity of the power of purchase, and of the liquid exportations for the period of January of 1999 to March of 2007. Then, simulations were realized, and were enabled to conclude that variations in the tax of change affect significantly the level of the interest rate internal, of the liquid exportations, and consequently, of the Brazilian production. And it was possible to observe that the political monetary, represented by variations in the interest rate had bigger influence on the production than political fiscal. The work enabled to verify also, that although the liquid exportations have been the main responsible for the growth of the Brazilian economy in the period, his effects practically were annulled by the high interest rate practiced, and that small reductions in the interest rate internal are capable to generate a stimulus considerably bigger on the growth of the production, if it is compared with variations of same magnitude on the liquid exportations...|$|E
