Combining a wrong type of routing metric with a geographic routing protocol may produce unexpected results, such as geographic routing loops and unreachable nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel routing algebra system {{to investigate the}} compatibilities between routing metrics and three geographic routing protocols including greedy, face and combined-greedyface routing. Four important algebraic properties, respectively named odd symmetry, transitivity, source independence and local minimum freeness, are defined in this algebra system.

We evaluate the performance of HBR in combination with two simple energy-aware geographic greedy routing algorithms based on physical coordinates and virtual coordinates, respectively.

40|$|Abstract — Stateless {{geographic}} routing provides {{relatively good}} performance {{at a fixed}} overhead, which is typically much lower than conventional routing protocols such as AODV. However, the performance of geographic routing is impacted by physical voids, and localization errors. Accordingly, virtual coordinate systems (VCS) were proposed as an alternative approach that is resilient to localization errors and that naturally routes around physical voids. However, VCS also faces virtual anomalies, causing their performance to trail geographic routing. In existing VCS routing protocols, {{there is a lack}} of an effective stateless and <b>delivery</b> <b>guaranteed</b> complementary routing algorithm that can be used to traverse voids. Most proposed solutions use variants of flooding or blind searching when a void is encountered.

With this approach, and for the first time, we demonstrate a stateless and <b>delivery</b> <b>guaranteed</b> geometric routing algorithm on VCS. When used in conjunction with our previously proposed aligned virtual coordinate system (AVCS), it out-performs not only all geometric routing protocols on VCS, but also geographic routing with accurate location information.

Accordingly, virtual coordinate systems (VCS) were proposed as an alternative approach that is resilient to localization errors and that naturally routes around physical voids.

Meanwhile, only greedy forwarding was proposed as routing algorithm on VCS without an even comparable performance to the greedy forwarding on physical coordinates. Our previous work improved the performance of greedy forwarding on VCS to a comparable or even better solution. However, it still faces the virtual void problem sometime. In all existing proposed geometric routing protocols based on VCS, a stateless and <b>delivery</b> <b>guaranteed</b> complementary routing algorithm was absent.
