[...] He then became calm and the mayor gave his speech. Franz Ferdinand had to wait as his own speech, still wet with blood from being in the damaged car, was brought to him. To the prepared text he added a few remarks about the day's events thanking the people of Sarajevo for their ovations [...] "as <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> them an expression of their joy at {{the failure of the}} attempt at assassination." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Penrose–Lucas {{argument}} {{about the implications of}} Gödel's incompleteness theorem for computational theories of human intelligence has been widely criticised by mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers, and the consensus among experts in these fields seems to be that the argument fails, though different authors may choose different aspects of the argument to attack. Marvin Minsky, a leading proponent of artificial intelligence, was particularly critical, stating that Penrose [...] "tries to show, in chapter after chapter, that human thought cannot be based on any known scientific principle." [...] Minsky's position is exactly the opposite – he believed that humans are, in fact, machines, whose functioning, although complex, is fully explainable by current physics. Minsky maintained that [...] "one can carry that quest [...] too far by only seeking new basic principles instead of attacking the real detail. This is what <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> Penrose's quest for a new basic principle of physics that will account for consciousness." ...|$|E

[...] He later told Lyell that [...] "Having burnt my own fingers so consumedly with the Wealden, I am fearful for you", and advised caution: [...] "for Heaven-sake take care of your fingers; to burn them severely, as I have done, is very unpleasant." [...] The third edition, as published on 30 April 1861, stated [...] "The computation of time required for the denudation of the Weald omitted.

[...] Lin Yong, former President of the Guangdong Artists' Association, waxes poetic in a memorable passage: [...] "Yim Mau-Kun has spent decades quietly, calmly, diligently and thoughtfully painting. [...] I don't know how many drawings and paintings he's created, and I don't know how many books he has read. [...] But over the decades, whenever we talk he often has impressive insights; he has never stopped thinking. [...] It's his diligence in studying, thinking, and articulating his thoughts that make me {{think of him as a}} Confucian scholar. [...] His insights have been very beneficial for me. [...] I see deep wrinkles in an old tree, ripples in a river, a rock unmoved by thunder and storms, a massive tree that remains unbent, and <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> Yim Mau-Kun a refreshing spring breeze."
