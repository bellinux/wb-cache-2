Alonso stayed in Merseyside to be at her side while she gave birth, later saying, [...] "It was a little frustrating to miss the match against Inter but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with my family at times like these." [...] His decision to place his family ahead of a Champions League tie caused much friction with former manager Rafael Benítez.

[...] the other. The cello provides an intricate counterpoint throughout, which Albert Schweitzer describes as [...] "a motif of purified happiness". The voices and the cello form a trio, another symbol of the Trinity. The musicologist Anne Leahy of the Dublin Institute of Technology notes that Bach had possibly stanza 3 in mind, which speaks of love, and used the instrument which is named after love.|$|E

He scored two goals in that final as Brazil beat Sweden 5–2 in Stockholm, the capital. His first goal where he flicked the ball over a defender before volleying into the corner of the net, was selected {{as one of the best}} goals in the history of the World Cup. Following Pelé's second goal, Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment; [...] "When Pelé scored the fifth goal in that Final, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> honest and say I felt like applauding". When the match ended, Pelé passed out on the field, and was revived by Garrincha. He then recovered, and was compelled by the victory to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker Just Fontaine, and was named best young player of the tournament.|$|E

Although he initially feared that it would prevent future appearances of Bobby, {{he was able to}} maintain his Supernatural [...] "quota" [...] with seven episodes. The character's role increased for the fifth season, which made sense for the actor due to the apocalyptic storyline. The season also introduced a new story arc for Bobby: his use of a wheelchair. Series creator Eric Kripke explained that it [...] " [...] the Apocalypse matter"; the writers wanted [...] "real stakes and real loss and real obstacles thrown in our heroes' way" [...] to differentiate it from prior seasons. Though he found it to be a challenge, Beaver enjoyed the experience because he could perform tricks on set that his wheelchair-using college roommate had taught him. However, the actor did [...] " [...] very seriously", and commented, [...] "I can get out of the chair {{at the end of the}} day and go home and I recognize that, so many people can't and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considerate to them and respect that." ...|$|E

Vialli also praised Zola, but felt that the honours had to be shared by all the players including Vialli himself, {{who took part in}} the match: [...] "It was a great first touch – he put the ball in the net and we won the cup. But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon."

500|$|Profitable though La fille du tambour-major was, {{composing}} it left Offenbach {{less time}} to work on his cherished project, the creation of a successful serious opera. Since the beginning of 1877, he had been working when he could on a piece based on a stage play, Les contes fantastiques d'Hoffmann, by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré. [...] Offenbach had suffered from gout since the 1860s, often being carried into the theatre in a chair. Now in failing health, he was conscious of his own mortality and wished passionately to live long enough to complete the opera Les contes d'Hoffmann ("The Tales of Hoffmann"). He was heard saying to Kleinzach, his dog, [...] "I would give everything <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at the première". However, Offenbach did not live to finish the piece. He left the vocal score substantially complete and had made a start on the orchestration. [...] Ernest Guiraud, a family friend, assisted by Offenbach's 18-year-old son Auguste, completed the orchestration, making significant changes as well as the substantial cuts demanded by the Opéra-Comique's director, Carvalho. [...] The opera was first seen at the Opéra-Comique on 10 February 1881; Guiraud added recitatives for the Vienna premiere, in December 1881, and other versions were made later.|$|E

He filmed Ban Geum-ryeon in 1975, but it was banned at the time, and not released until 1981, with 40 minutes of footage censored. The government also coerced Kim into making an anti-Communist propaganda film. The resulting film, Love of Blood Relations (1976), transcended the bounds of propaganda by portraying the communist agent as one of Kim's typical femme fatale characters. Kim later commented, [...] "North or south, capitalist or communist, ideology is far less interesting to me than the things that divide the sexes." ...|$|E

Sim had mixed feelings about its success and believed it could affect his songwriting in the future: [...] "This album was done with no expectations. No one knew who we were.

When Coexist debuted in September 2012, xx was still on the British chart at number 37 and had sold 446,734 copies in the UK. The following year, it was ranked number 237 on NMEs list of the top 500 albums of all time and named the 74th greatest debut record by Rolling Stone, who found its music radical as [...] "an exercise in restraint, in the artful use of space and silence" [...] during popular music's period of maximalism.|$|E
500|$|Nagy set the {{adaptation}} {{several years later}} than the time in which the novel is set, so [...] "the dawn of the Eisenhower administration {{and the rise of}} HUAC could be front and center". One of the challenges of adapting the novel was translating the subjective and limited third-person viewpoint whereby the narrator [...] "sits on the shoulder of Therese and makes regular advances into (and retreats from) her head" [...] and Carol is thus largely seen through Therese's fanatical prism. Nagy was initially apprehensive of the narrative structure, considering [...] "there's no character of Carol. She's a ghost appropriately, as she should be, in the novel", adding that she was [...] "overwhelmed by the task of {{trying to come up with}} the visual equivalent for it structurally." [...] Nagy decided to split the point of view and shift perspectives from Therese to Carol, as [...] "the point of view is always with the more vulnerable party". She made Therese a photographer instead of a set designer, allowing her [...] "to be seen moving from objects to people", which Nagy likened to Highsmith as Therese is a [...] "clear stand-in" [...] for the author. Nagy drew from her personal knowledge of Highsmith for Therese, describing one of Therese's lines, [...] "I started taking pictures of people because my friend says <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more interested in humans", as the epitome of Highsmith: [...] "that ability to step outside of life and comment on it before participating in it". For the character of Carol, Nagy took inspiration from the silhouette and underpinning of Grace Kelly's character in Rear Window (1954). Nagy had freedom in [...] "inventing a life for , for whom, basically, we knew the outline of what was going on." [...] Once Nagy was able to dig into and understand the inner life of Carol, her motivations given the circumstances, then the character became easy to write. Nagy aimed to [...] "focus on the nature of what it's like to fall in love from two points of view", and show the characters [...] "just behaving ... not inhabiting positions." ...|$|E

[...] Lewis described the album's style as [...] "classic songs with a contemporary edge", containing R and [...] "fresh pop" [...] styles, ballads and [...] "soulful up-tempo numbers". It has an American style, with some electronic 1980s sounds; however, the songs are not beat-driven or following the latest trends, but are songs that can be performed acoustically.|$|E
