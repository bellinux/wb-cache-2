40|$|This {{fact sheet}} answers the most {{frequently}} asked health questions (FAQs) about <b>fuel</b> <b>oils.</b> For more information, call the ATSDR Information Center at 1 - 888 - 422 - 8737. This fact sheet is {{one in a series}} of summaries about hazardous substances and their health effects. It’s important you understand this information because this substance may harm you. The effects of exposure to any hazardous substance depend on the dose, the duration, how you are exposed, personal traits and habits, and whether other chemicals are present. SUMMARY: <b>Fuel</b> <b>oils</b> are liquid mixtures produced from petroleum, and their use mostly involves burning them as fuels. Drinking or breathing <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> may cause nausea or nervous system effects. However, exposure under normal use conditions {{is not likely to be}} harmful. <b>Fuel</b> <b>oils</b> have been found in at least 26 of the 1, 430 National Priorities List sites identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). What are <b>fuel</b> <b>oils?</b> (Pronounced fy 6 !;l oilz) <b>Fuel</b> <b>oils</b> are a variety of yellowish to light brown liquid mixtures that come from crude petroleum.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{organosulfur}} compound {{present in all}} petroleum fractions is thiophene (C4H4S), a cyclic and aromatic liquid. In addition, the heavy fractions of oil contain benzothiophene (C8H6S, thianaphtene) and dibenzothiophene. Most of the last compounds are solids and smell like naphthalene. Many methylated, dimethyl, diethyl benzothiophene derivatives are present in diesel and <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> which make <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> very difficult to clean.|$|R

5|$|On 25 October 1960, {{in thick}} fog {{and a strong}} tide, two barges (named the Arkendale H and Wastdale H) which had {{overshot}} Sharpness Dock, collided {{with one of the}} columns of the bridge after being carried upstream. Two bridge spans collapsed into the river. As they fell, parts of the structure hit the barges causing the <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> and petroleum they were carrying to catch fire. Five people died in the incident.|$|E
5|$|The MOD {{commissioned}} {{a series of}} multi-beam sonar surveys to image the wreck and appraise its condition. The high-resolution sonograms showed Royal Oak to be lying almost upside down with her top works forced into the seabed. The tip of the bow had been blown off by U-47s first torpedo and a gaping hole on the starboard flank {{was the result of}} the triple strike from her second successful salvo. Following several years of delays, Briggs Marine was contracted by the MoD to conduct the task of pumping off the remaining oil. Royal Oaks mid-construction conversion to <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> had placed her fuel tanks in unconventional positions, complicating operations. By 2006, all double bottom tanks had been cleared and the task of removing oil from the inner wing tanks with cold cutting equipment began the next year. By 2010, some 1600 tonnes of <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> had been removed, and the wreck was declared to be no longer actively releasing oil into Scapa Flow. Operations continue at a reduced pace to tackle the oil known to be remaining (state for 2012).|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} underwater protection {{was replaced}} by the Pugliese system that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo warhead. It lacked enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes. A major problem of the reconstruction was that the ships' increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load.|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} the effect of water soluble {{fractions}} (WSF) of petroleum products (diesel, kerosene and petrol), on two test microalgae — Desmodesmus quadricauda and Eudorina elegans — was conducted in the laboratory for 14 days using various concentrations (0 %, 10 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 %). The growth response was measured spectrophotometrically using optical density at 680 nm. A general assessment indicates that both microalgae used were impaired by the high concentrations of WSF of these <b>fuel</b> <b>oils,</b> while lower concentrations stimulated growth. For Eudorina elegans, maximum growth was obtained at 10 % in all <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> except kerosene, where maximum growth was obtained at 25 %. For Desmodesmus quadricauda, maximum growth was recorded at 10 % in diesel, 25 % in kerosene and 50 % in petrol. The study revealed that both test microalgae had their minimum growth and were highly inhibited in 100 % concentration of water soluble fractions of the <b>fuel</b> <b>oils.</b> E. elegans was more inhibited than D. quadricauda in all concentrations of water soluble fractions of the <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> except at 100 % concentration, where D. quadricauda was more inhibited.

5|$|A new {{main drain}} to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, {{using one of the}} first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically in the early twentieth century. The last regular commercial traffic was the tanker barge Shellfen, which delivered <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> to pumping stations until 1971.|$|E
5|$|After Germany's {{conquest of}} Romania (see Romania during World War I), the German Imperial Navy had {{sufficient}} <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> for submarines {{located in the}} Black Sea. UB-44 and three of her sister ships in the Pola Flotilla were ordered to Constantinople and, en route, had to navigate through the Dardanelles, which had been heavily mined by the Allies {{in the middle of}} 1916.

The library's plaster cornice and other architectural details have been restored based on a 1912 photograph. In 1964 the home was donated {{to the city of}} DeKalb and converted into a museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{evolution in}} dreadnought protection {{came with the}} development of the anti-torpedo bulge and torpedo belt, both attempts to protect against underwater damage by mines and torpedoes. The purpose of underwater protection was to absorb the force of a detonating mine or torpedo well away from the final watertight hull. This meant an inner bulkhead {{along the side of the}} hull, which was generally lightly armoured to capture splinters, separated from the outer hull by one or more compartments. The compartments in between were either left empty, or filled with coal, water or <b>fuel</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} since the bombing, scientists, {{security}} experts, and the ATF have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with <b>fuel</b> <b>oil.</b> The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the fertilizer (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive.|$|E
