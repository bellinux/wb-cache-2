40|$|In {{this study}} I address {{the moral and}} {{cultural}} disagreement and conflict regarding the interpretation of human rights norms that threatens {{the legitimacy of the}} human rights enterprise. Such disagreements present an opportunity to probe, question and dissect beliefs to uncover inconsistencies and false assumptions and attain a deeper insight into human rights norms that are presently left in a rather abstract form in international human rights documents and conventions. I describe and defend an institutionally-driven dialogical approach that promises to systematically address these moral and cultural disagreements. My approach rests on two claims. First, clearer content for human rights norms will emerge from within particular cultures if critical cultural and moral investigation through dialogue is encouraged. By engaging <b>in</b> <b>dialogical</b> <b>processes,</b> we not only discharge our obligation to aid in a process that leads to a fair specification of human rights norms, but we also come to understand how human rights norms are, at their very core, participative. Second, one way that international human rights institutions (IHRIs) can legitimately fulfill their function of supporting human rights is by encouraging critical moral investigation through dialogue. I make this proposal more concrete by discussing the case law on the issue of transsexuals that has come before the European Court of Human Rights. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{presentation}} was drawing methods and their application in thinking through 'wicked problems'. The presentation focussed on three aspects of drawing and diagramming: drawing as observation; drawing as imagination/speculation; drawing and 'rich pictures'. The presentation was delivered {{as part of}} the HEA-funded workshop 'Interdisciplinary Imaginations: using creative methodologies to solve 'wicked problems'. Organisers were Rowan Bailey, Katie Beverley, Karen Shah and Juliet MacDonald. This presentation and workshop event sought to foster new knowledge and understanding of creative methodologies in the context of interdisciplinary problem solving. ‘Wicked problems’, broadly defined, are social or cultural issues that are almost impossible to solve, due to their complexity. Humanitarian issues are familiar wicked problems: poverty, education, health, sustainability and equality are all indeterminate in scope and scale and thus never resolvable with one clear-cut solution. The magnitude of these complex global issues highlights a growing demand for interdisciplinary teams to come together to effect social change through collaboration. At the core of this growing cultural and social phenomenon is an understanding of the value and benefits of working collectively and creatively, divergently and discursively. This event set out to promote the idea that the condition of the interdisciplinary imagination has the potential to create new learning experiences. Participants at the workshop were encouraged, through designed tasks, to explore different disciplinary perspectives and world-views, actively engage <b>in</b> <b>dialogical</b> <b>processes</b> to produce new dynamics, deploy and invent creative approaches to wicked problems, and experience first-hand, interdisciplinary learning across the disciplines...|$|E
40|$|Creative methodologies {{are often}} used to {{facilitate}} interdisciplinary solutions for ‘wicked problems’. But can these divergent thinking tools aid interdisciplinary learning {{in the arts and}} humanities and with what benefits? This group workshop invites delegates to creative collaborative solutions by testing different art and design approaches to problem-solving. This workshop intends to generate new knowledge and understanding of creative methodologies in the context of interdisciplinary problem solving. Delegates will be introduced to what constitutes a ‘wicked problem’ and how one might tackle it within a teaching and learning context. It will contextualise different approaches to the use of creative methodologies in postgraduate education, through art and design methodologies and more widely through interdisciplinary networks of social entrepreneurship. The workshop activities will equip delegates with the skills of practicing soft systems methodologies (rich pictures), Edward de Bono’s six thinking hats approach, inference based actions and design thinking models (empathy building and divergent thinking). These skills will be applied to different problems with the purpose of delegates experiencing first-hand interdisciplinary learning across the disciplines. This event promotes the idea that the condition of the interdisciplinary imagination has the potential to create new learning experiences. The interdisciplinary group can facilitate differing perspectives, deploy and invent new methodologies, actively engage <b>in</b> <b>dialogical</b> <b>processes</b> to produce different dynamics from that of the established disciplines. In this context, the interdisciplinary imagination is also a cross-, trans-. multi-, and intra-creative process to be experienced within the group. ‘Wicked problems’, broadly defined, are social or cultural issues that are almost impossible to solve, due to their complexity. Humanitarian issues are familiar wicked problems: poverty, education, health, sustainability and equality are all indeterminate in scope and scale and thus never resolvable with one clear-cut solution. In the 1970 s, Horst Rittel and Melvin M. Webber identified ten characteristics that make problems ‘wicked’ (Rittel and Webber, 1973). These features soon became the benchmark for identifying new and innovative ways to address to the complex barriers of large-scale issues. Bell and Morse (1999), Brown, Harris and Russell (2012), Crouch and Pearce (2012) present current theories and debates within which wicked problems sit, including the positive effects design thinking can bring to these dilemmas. Calls to actively tackle wicked problems have become a popular feature of macro research trends in design and social entrepreneurship (see Austin Center for Design, Studio H and RSA – Ideas and Actions for a 21 st Century enlightenment). The magnitude of complex global issues highlights a growing demand for interdisciplinary teams to come together to effect social change through collaboration. At the core of this growing cultural and social phenomenon is an understanding of the value and benefits of working collectively and creatively, divergently and discursively. Such approaches provide opportunities to tap into interdisciplinary learning experiences, and can be used to actively problem-solve specific issues (see De Bono, 1985; Checkland and Poulter, 2006).

40|$|Dialogic {{pedagogy}} involves {{students as}} critical inquirers, who can analyze their perspectives and attitudes. Dialogic creates liminal space (Buber, 1965) where conversation generates knowledge and personal relations. I intend to explore these ‘dialogic spaces’ {{where a group}} of 20 students and their teacher engage in dialogue around literary texts in an advanced English composition and literature major class of female students of one university in United Arab Emirates (UAE). My study takes further, growing interest in the value of <b>dialogical</b> <b>process</b> <b>in</b> second language learning. It describes the ways in which learners engaged <b>in</b> <b>dialogical</b> <b>process</b> begin to challenge perspectives and power relations. Because of the positive response that followed the sessions (conducted for the pilot study), I wanted to explore the process in relation to gender and culture. My dissertation research takes further the questions raised in the assignment study. I want to consider the conditions that will allow perspectives to remain in dialogue. My research explores how dialogic literacy practices function in relation to particular cultural and ideological discourses (Fairclough, 1992; Gee, 1996; Luke, 1991). The data include: class observations, field notes, semi-structured interviews (of students and the teacher) and writing assignments. The study employs an exploratory research design to discover and understand perspectives of the people involved (Merriam, 1998). I therefore emphasize that the analyses of the data are offered as partial and unfinished interpretations based on a specific theoretical framework. Although the research findings cannot be generalized across all female students in the UAE, they provide some insight into the learning experiences and preferences of Emirati women. Knowledge is finding light in darkness and staying warm in the cold. This is the knowledge our students must acquire. Not facts and theories, but a deep knowing (O’Reilley, 1998). Thus it seems appropriate to me to call this study, ‘the lighting of a fire’ (W. B. Yeats). EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

All these tools are made concrete for engineering practice by means of schemes, drawings, design questions, moral standards, check-off lists and design heuristics.

Design: Leiman's (2000) definition of reflexivity {{was used as a}} starting-point for an exploratory investigation of the use of language as reflective activity. Grounded theory was chosen as an appropriate methodology to distil an explanatory account across the qualitative data collected. Method: Six psychologist-client pairs supplied three tapes of therapy sessions spread out across the course of therapy. Each participant was separately interviewed on two occasions to ascertain their views of therapy and of the emerging grounded theory. Results: A grounded theory was developed conceptualizing the processes and activities in psychological therapy in psychosis. Conclusions: Building bridges to observational perspectives summarizes the core process in psychological therapy in psychosis.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a dialogical {{approach}} to empirical ethics, based upon hermeneutic ethics and responsive evaluation. Hermeneutic ethics regards experience as the concrete source of moral wisdom. In order to gain {{a good understanding of}} moral issues, concrete detailed experiences and perspectives need to be exchanged. Within hermeneutic ethics dialogue is seen as a vehicle for moral learning and developing normative conclusions. Dialogue stands for a specific view on moral epistemology and methodological criteria for moral inquiry. Responsive evaluation involves a structured way of setting up <b>dialogical</b> learning <b>processes,</b> by eliciting stories of participants, exchanging experiences in (homogeneous and heterogeneous) groups and drawing normative conclusions for practice. By combining these traditions we develop both a theoretical and a practical approach to empirical ethics, in which ethical issues are addressed and shaped together with stakeholders in practice. Stakeholders' experiences are not only used as a source for reflection by the ethicist; stakeholders are involved in the process of reflection and analysis, which takes place in a dialogue between participants in practice, facilitated by the ethicist. This dialogical approach to empirical ethics may give rise to questions such as: What contribution does the ethicist make? What role does ethical theory play? What is the relationship between empirical research and ethical theory <b>in</b> the <b>dialogical</b> <b>process?</b> <b>In</b> this article, these questions will be addressed by reflecting upon a project in empirical ethics that was set up <b>in</b> a <b>dialogical</b> way.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that “no use” drug {{education}} programs, {{with the objective of}} scaring or shaming youth into abstinence, have not been effective in addressing problematic substance use. The ineffectiveness of such scare tactic approaches has led program developers to focus on prevention and harm reduction associated with drug use, or in general, health literacy promotion. While significant ‘discussion-based’ drug education programs have been developed over the past decade and has encouraged students to be expressive and critical thinkers regarding drug use, their effective implementation has been a challenge. This paper introduces Engaged Philosophical Inquiry (EPI) as a pedagogical approach in order to promote drug literacy. The EPI approach is used both as the content and means of professional development for high school teachers to address the significant role of teachers in these programs. Its goal is to help teachers become aware of and re-evaluate their biases, beliefs and behaviors, before they are able to facilitate a non-stereotyped, open, and thoughtful discussion on drug use related topics. The overall idea of this paper is based on an in-progress research project sponsored by Mitacs organization. It discusses the significance of the project by first presenting the existing methods and theoretical approaches to drug education. On that basis, it shows how EPI can contribute to traditional drug education approaches. It then describes how the methodology and phases of the project are rooted <b>in</b> a <b>dialogical</b> <b>process</b> that aim for a close collaboration with teachers...|$|R
40|$|Motivation – Learning {{from the}} shared design process of a {{cognitive}} tool: how it promotes changes in designers’ activities {{as well as}} in those of potential users, and how the tool evolves in such a process. Research approach – Three groups of potential users worked in interaction with agronomist researchers who had designed the tool’s concepts, and ergonomists who assisted them in building this interaction and in the debriefings. After explorative surveys to build a prototype of the cognitive tool in line with users’ activities, this prototype was used in collective groups of agronomists and potential users and then put {{into the hands of the}} users for a two-week period to give them a personal view of the tool. Data collected during this “test” period were then analysed to further develop the tool and to discuss with the users the changes they encountered in their activity, in relation to the process as a whole. Findings/Design – The interface but also the concepts underlying the tool were altered profoundly, thus raising new scientific questions for agronomists. The users developed a new understanding of their cognitive task. We suggest that this was achieved by (i) group discussions around the prototype between actors with diverse points of view; and (ii) the way the users were asked to “play” with the prototype by focusing specifically on cognitive dimensions of their activity. Take-away message – We explored three dimensions of tool design, namely crystallization, plasticity and development, as well as their evolution over time.

40|$|The {{paradoxical}} co-existence {{of conflicting}} logics governs practices in cultural organizations. This requires ‘balancing acts’ between artistic and managerial efforts, {{which are often}} subjects to struggle among the organizational members. This ethnographic study aims to go beyond either-or thinking on the paradoxical organizational context by examining how the organizational members of an opera house construct views on their organization <b>in</b> <b>dialogical</b> meaning-making <b>processes.</b> Various professional groups, dozens of upcoming productions, increased international cooperation, and global competition combined with scarce financial resources make opera houses a complex though interesting context for organization studies. In order to provide a deeper knowledge of the internal dynamics of an opera organization this thesis takes an interpretative view to examine the ways organizational members construct {{and make sense of}} their organization. How is the opera organization constructed by the organizational members? How do the members draw on different logics when relating to their organization? Or what are the elements that characterize the relational processes of organizational identity construction in an opera organization? The thesis aims to answer these questions by providing {{a detailed description of the}} everyday life of an opera organization and a particular focus put on organizational identity construction. The processes of organizational identity construction are approached from a relational point of view. This may involve various relations between multiple positions, different professional groups, other organizations in the cultural field or between past and present understandings of an organization. The study shows that the construction of an opera organization involves not only the two conflicting logics of art and economy, but also the logic of a national institution. The study suggests also that organizational identities are constructed through processes related to the dialogics of positions, work and management practices. The dialogics involve various struggles through which the organizational members find themselves between the different organizational aspects such as visiting ‘stars’ and an ensemble or between ‘Finnishness’ of opera productions and internationalization. In addition, the study argues that a struggle between different elements is a general mode of relation in cultural organizations and therefore an inherent and enduring aspect in the organizational identity construction. However, the space of ‘being in between’ involves both the enabling and constraining elements <b>in</b> the <b>dialogical</b> identity construction <b>in</b> the context of cultural organizations, which present the struggle in a more generative light...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse music teachers’ collegiate discourses on {{ensemble}} playing with regard to dialogically expressed criteria and conceptions of quality, and to relate these criteria and conceptions to the national governing documents for upper secondary ensemble education. The study has two theoretical perspectives, that is, a didactical perspective and a dialogical perspective. The research setting {{as well as the}} research questions are clearly didactical, whilst dialogical theory is used both as a foundation for the research method and as an ontology against which the findings are interpreted. Topic analysis, which is based on a dialogical theory of sense-making according to which meaning is constituted <b>in</b> a double <b>dialogical</b> <b>process</b> between interactants, situation and socio-cultural traditions is the method used. Four groups of music teachers have discussed video excerpts of popular music ensembles from ensemble classes, and these discussions have been analysed with respect to topics displaying conceptions of musical and didactical quality. Topics are created through communicative projects, in which two or more people display a mutual understanding of what they are talking about. Thus, all conceptions of quality elicited from the participant groups of ensemble teachers are the result of intersubjective sense-making. The results show that the ideal of informal music-making is so strong that the groups describe teacher intervention as detrimental to musical progress. Very little is said about the sounding music, whereas physical expressivity, autonomy and joy of playing are prominent topics. The apparent lack of music-specific, “contextual” criteria and the low valuation of the teachers’ work are discussed as possible threats to the existence of music as a subject in the national curriculum...|$|R

40|$|Falar sobre a família como foco de intervenção exige aprofundar a discussão sobre o que é uma família e como ela pode servir ou não de recurso em programas de intervenção; exige também problematizar um elemento básico do processo de intervenção: a comunicação entre técnicos que atuam na intervenção e a população-alvo. Assim, neste trabalho, sugere-se, num primeiro momento, algumas pistas analíticas que podem ajudar o técnico a perceber dinâmicas familiares em grupos populares do Brasil. Descobrimos assim que, da perspectiva espacial, redes de parentesco se estendem além do grupo consangüíneo e da unidade doméstica para esferas mais amplas. Da perspectiva temporal, as pessoas se inserem em uma sucessão de gerações, possibilitando projeções para o futuro ou resgates de elementos do passado. Passa-se então a {{considerar}} a contribuição específica de uma teoria da prática e as implicações metodológicas de uma análise centrada em "modos de vida", arraigados numa situação de classe. Finalmente, comenta-se o olhar reflexivo - um elemento fundamental do processo dialógico que permite a escuta do outro em qualquer situação de intervenção. Propõe-se com essa abordagem descolonizar o olhar do técnico, propiciando uma interação dialógica capaz de reforçar, antes de reprimir, recursos tradicionais na situação em que se pretende intervir. To {{speak of}} the famliy as focus of intervention not only demands a probing discussion about what constitutes a family and how this social group {{may or may not}} be an important ressource in intervention programs, it also demands a close look at a basic element of the intervention process: the communication between intervening professionals and the target population. Thus, in this article, we first consider certain analytical leads that might help professionals perceive family dynamics in Brazilian working-class groups. We discover that, from a spatial perspective, family networks reach beyond the consanguineal or household units to much wider spheres; from a temporal perspective, individuals are embedded in the play of successive generations, allowing for a projection of relations into the future or salvaging of elements from the past. We then consider the specific contribution of an approach involving practice theory, and the methodological implications of centering the analysis on "lifestyles", involving class-bound specificities. Finally, we outline properties of the "reflexive gaze" - a fundamental element <b>in</b> the <b>dialogical</b> <b>process</b> that permits one to hear what others are saying. We propose, with this approach, to contribute toward the "decolonization" of intervention projects, encountering manners to reinforce rather than repress traditional social and community ressources...|$|R
40|$|Restructuring {{practices}} {{belong to}} today's organizational life. Even if {{the phenomenon is}} not new it significantly evolved over time, {{both in terms of}} motives and in terms of expressions, from major events to permanent practices, from crisis to competitiveness restructurings, from reactive to more proactive decisions, from highly visible to more silent decisions. Much debated in popular medias, restructuring issues have been also inspiring scholars from various fields (sociology, economics, management, law [...] .) for now three decades. But at the same time, academic literature, especially in management, has hardly contributed in understanding the deep complexity and the multiple hidden dimensions of restructuring situations. We suggest ethnographic studies could open the " black box " of restructuring issues, thus complementing the inevitably over-simplified models testing the explanatory relationships between a set of variables or constructs. Traditional ethnographic method is scarcely chosen by scholars analyzing restructuring issues, mainly for reasons related to practical access to fieldwork: restructuring is a hot issue, and it remains difficult to access information and informants in a restructuring organization. In order to overcome these issues, we developed a specific research method what we call an Art-Based, Collective and Dialogic Ethnographic method (1.), both in its deliberate choices (1. 1.) and its emergent dimensions (1. 2.). Then we describe the outputs of the method (2.), in terms of creating new knowledge about restructuring issues (2. 1.), but also in terms of fostering new ways of teaching, thinking or practicing restructurings (2. 2.). In the final section, we discuss the basic principles of the method as well as its outcomes, especially in terms of creating "vicarious experiential knowledge" (3.). This method is based on three main features. First, we suggest investigate restructuring issues through artworks. Second, as restructurings are multi-actor situations and multi-dimensional phenomena, research on restructurings could benefit from a heterogeneous and multi-disciplinary group of actors as a community of inquirers confronting their points of view and reflecting together about the complexity and the heterogeneity of restructuring phenomena <b>in</b> a <b>dialogical</b> <b>process</b> of investigation. Third, combining in the same research design a heterogeneous group of actors and a series of artworks about restructurings can lead to innovative research methods: collective comments about artworks and indirect analysis of restructuring, reflexive analysis of actors' involvement, comments and discussions used as data, what we propose here as a new form of organizational ethnographic research...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Susswein et al’s {{analysis}} of the existing discourse on internalization in psychology continues the dialogue within the socio-cultural field on the prioritization of person-centered (focusing on the “inside””outside ” separation) or communion-centered (emphasizing the core meanings of “participation”, “mastery”) tactics for theory construction. Taking the latter axiomatic stand, Susswein et al. decide not to build their account {{through the use of}} the internalization concept, persuading their readers to accept the notions of mastery and adaptation instead. In contrast, I start from the axiomatic perspective within which internalization is necessarily the central concept. My theoretical construction prioritizes subjective experiencing as culturally mediated through the personal construction of the self that coincides with re-construction of the cultural (semiotic) mediating devices. The multi-layer model of internalization/externalization guarantees the production of novelty and openness to innovation together with selective buffering of the intra-psychological affective and mental worlds through <b>dialogical</b> <b>processes</b> at the always ambiguous quadratic boundary of the unity of INSIDE/OUTSIDE and PAST/FUTURE functionally related opposites. Possible forms of <b>dialogical</b> <b>processes</b> at the transfer loci are discussed...|$|R
