5000|$|Acalypha indica (English: Indian Acalypha, Indian Mercury, Indian Copperleaf, <b>Indian</b> <b>Nettle,</b> Three-seeded Mercury) is a {{herbaceous}} annual {{that has}} catkin like inflorescences with cup-shaped involucres surrounding the minute flowers. It is mainly {{known for its}} root being attractive to domestic cats, and for its various medicinal uses. It occurs throughout the Tropics.|$|E
50|$|Trema lamarckiana, the Lamarck's trema or West <b>Indian</b> <b>nettle</b> tree, is {{a species}} of a plant in the Cannabaceae family {{belonging}} to a genus of Treme Lour. It is a small evergreen shrub that is native of Florida and the West Indies. It has several common names such as pain-in-back, cabrilla and Lamarck trema. It is 6 m tall growing all year.|$|E

5000|$|November 27, 1972: John Ellis, Jerry Kenney, Charlie Spikes, and Rusty Torres were traded by the Yankees to the Cleveland <b>Indians</b> for Graig <b>Nettles</b> and Jerry Moses.|$|R
50|$|On December 10, 1969, the Twins traded Nettles with Dean Chance, Ted Uhlaender, and {{a player}} to be named later (PTBNL) to the Cleveland Indians for Luis Tiant and Stan Williams. After playing three seasons with the Indians, the New York Yankees {{acquired}} Nettles with Jerry Moses for John Ellis, Jerry Kenney, Charlie Spikes, and Rusty Torres. The <b>Indians</b> traded <b>Nettles</b> due to a feud between Nettles and manager Ken Aspromonte.|$|R
50|$|Spikes {{was drafted}} {{in the first round}} of the 1969 Major League Baseball Draft by the Yankees. He made his major league debut with the Yankees in 1972. Following the 1972 season, he was traded by the Yankees with John Ellis, Jerry Kenney and Rusty Torres to the <b>Indians</b> for Graig <b>Nettles</b> and Jerry Moses. He played for the Indians through the 1977 season, when he was traded to the Tigers for Tom Veryzer.|$|R
40|$|Bio-active {{compounds}} {{present in}} West <b>Indian</b> Wood <b>Nettle</b> Laportea aestuans (L.) Chew (Urticaceae), used in ethno medicine as antioxidant and antimicrobial were studied. The {{aim of this}} research work was to isolate and characterize the bio-active compounds in the n-hexane fraction of L. aestuans, determine the toxicity and subject it to in-vitro antimicrobial and free radical scavenging activities. The chemical constituents were isolated by gradient elution column chromatographic technique and Ultra Violet/visible (UV), Infrared (IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopies were used for structural elucidation. The free radical scavenging activity of the isolate was assessed using three methods; scavenging effect on 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH), hydroxyl radical generated from hydrogen peroxide and ferric thiocynate method. Antimicrobial screening was done by agar well diffusion method while toxicity was determined by Brine shrimp lethality test. Structures were proposed for the white crystalline solids isolated; (4 E) - 3, 6 -dimethylhep- 4 -en- 3 -ol (AB) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 a, 4 b, 5, 6, 6 a, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10 a, 10 b, 11 -hexadecahydro- 1, 1, 6 a, 10 b-tetramethyl- 7 -((E) - 4, 7 -dimethyloct- 5 -enyl) chrysen- 2 -ol (AC). Percentage yield of AC was 91. 2 and was non-toxic with LC 50 (Î¼g/ml) value of 1581233000. 0. AC significantly scavenged free radical at 0. 0625 mg/ml in the DPPH (64. 73 %) and hydrogen peroxide (99. 22 %) tests. It also showed 65. 23 % inhibition at 1. 0 mg/ml in the ferric thiocyanate test. AC also inhibited microbial growth significantly when compared with gentamicin and tioconazole which are antibacterial and antifungal standards respectively. The presence of Chrysen- 2 -ol derivative in L. aestuans which was non-toxic and possessed significant antimicrobial and antioxidant activities supports its ethno medicinal application...|$|R
