25|$|In 269, Ding Feng {{was ordered}} to {{garrison}} at Xu embankment (徐塘) and later attack the Jin territory of Guyang (穀陽). When the residents in Guyang learnt of the Wu army's approach, they immediately evacuated the area and Ding Feng did not obtain anything in the campaign. Sun Hao was furious when he <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> and he had Ding Feng's army guide (導軍) executed.|$|E
25|$|In January 1910 Griffith and Lee Dougherty {{with the}} rest of the Biograph acting company {{traveled}} to Los Angeles. While the purpose of the trip was to shoot Ramona in authentic locations, it was also to determine the suitability of the West Coast as a place for a permanent studio. The group set up a small facility at Washington Street and Grand Avenue (where the Los Angeles Convention Center now stands). After this, Griffith and his players decided to go a little further north to a small village they had <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> was friendly and had beautiful floral scenery. They decided to travel there and fell in love with this little place called Hollywood. Biograph then made the first film ever in Hollywood called In Old California, a Latino melodrama about the early days of Mexico-owned California. Griffith and the Biograph troupe filmed other short movies at various locations, then traveled back to New York. After the East Coast film community heard about Hollywood, other companies began to migrate there. Biograph’s little film launched Hollywood as the future movie capital of the world. It opened a studio at Pico and Georgia streets in downtown Los Angeles in 1911, and sent a film crew to work there each year until 1916.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Beatty {{convinced}} cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki {{and film}} critic Leonard Maltin to make The Dick Tracy TV Special for Turner Classic Movies, which featured Beatty as Tracy having a retrospective interview with Maltin. Maltin explicitly asks the fictional Tracy if Warren Beatty is planning on making {{a sequel to}} the 1990 film and he responds that he's <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> but Maltin needs to ask Beatty himself. By March 2009, Tribune was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and lawyers for the company began to declare their ownership of television and film rights to Dick Tracy. [...] "Mr. Beatty's conduct and wrongful claims have effectively locked away certain motion picture and television rights to the Dick Tracy property," [...] lawyers for Tribune wrote in a filing. Fields responded that it was [...] "a nuisance lawsuit by a bankrupt company {{and they should be}} ashamed of themselves." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I've <b>heard</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{king and}} his wives. But about Lampard, it do seem strange I've never heard that name before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You haven't <b>heard</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> fellow Saton?" [...] he asked. [...] "You don't {{know whether}} {{he is in the}} neighborhood or not?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Did {{you watch}} the {{television}} show about the local drug problem {{a few days ago}} when a local policeman appeared for a long time? Have you <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> show? Have you read or heard about recent newspaper articles to the effect that the local drug problem is bad? Would you try this case {{solely on the basis of}} the evidence presented in this courtroom? Would you be influenced by the circumstances that the prosecution’s witness, a police officer, has publicly spoken on TV about drugs? ...|$|E
2500|$|In 219, Guan Yu led an army {{to attack}} Cao Cao's {{fortress}} at Fan (樊; or Fancheng, present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei), which was defended by Cao Ren. He left behind his subordinates Shi Ren and Mi Fang to defend Gong'an County and Nan Commandery (南郡; around present-day Jiangling County, Hubei) respectively. When Lü Meng <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> {{he wrote to}} Sun Quan: [...] Sun Quan agreed to Lü Meng's plan and pretended to approve his request to return to Jianye for medical treatment.|$|E

5000|$|In Psych (2006-2014) Pluto's {{demotion}} from planetary {{status was}} used by the character Burton [...] "Gus" [...] Guster as a consistently unsuccessful pick-up line: [...] "You <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Pluto? <b>That's</b> messed up, right?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's it, is it!" [...] cried {{one of the}} men. [...] "Seems to me I <b>heard</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Your uncle {{played the}} regular hero act." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> affair at Clamart," [...] {{they demanded}} eagerly. [...] "They say the line behaved shamefully, and that Trochu {{declares}} they shall be decimated." ...|$|E
6000|$|He did not {{laugh at}} this; on the contrary, his face darkened. [...] "I've <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Did he advise your uncle {{to go into}} this same {{transportation}} company?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that was}} before our fathers went to Putnam Hall," [...] {{answered}} Randy. [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> too. But while our fathers were there, the food was very good, indeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are several}} reasons," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Locker. [...] "For one thing, that musical uproar last night. I have not <b>heard</b> anything <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> and I don't know where I stand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What was that, if I may ask?' Mr. Singleton said. 'I have <b>heard</b> nothing <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> and I {{am quite}} sure that Ned Hampton would not have doubted Dorothy without what he {{believed}} to be very strong evidence.' ...|$|R
60|$|When Tom Dillon <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> {{the light}} <b>that</b> {{had been seen}} and the {{determination}} to walk to it, {{he wanted to know}} how far off it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, we <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{business}} from Mr. Nolan, and although you speak lightly of it, it was, he tells us, a very gallant affair indeed. But now as to this other matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O no, {{he has not}} gone; {{he would}} not when he <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Higg," [...] said Janet, with uneasy and much disgusted face. [...] "He couldn't do any good after his meddling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess you're too square," [...] {{said the}} girl. [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Brophy business." [...] And then she laughed softly. [...] "Do {{you know who}} the biggest backers of that graft were?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was {{not only}} that, added Tom; 'but I've more to say to you, while one {{can be sure of}} a quiet moment. Have you <b>heard</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> place?' and he pointed {{in the direction of the}} Vintry Mill.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>heard</b> all <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Ike hasn't {{any of his}} {{own money}} in the thing. He's getting twenty-five per cent of the show for running it. The angel is the long fellow you see jumping around. Pilkington his name is." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1954, they <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> {{a contest}} <b>that</b> {{was being held}} by an arranger/pianist named Freddy Johnson at the old CBS building. The Wrens entered and won, and Johnson became their manager.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is most interesting," [...] Mr. Brand continued. [...] "I {{only wish}} she would speak French; {{it would seem}} more in keeping. It must be quite the style that we have <b>heard</b> <b>about,</b> <b>that</b> we have read about--the style of {{conversation}} of Madame de Stael, of Madame Recamier." ...|$|E
60|$|But she {{was willing}} to sit and talk to Mr. Burke, for she wanted to ask him some {{questions}} about Mrs. Cliff. She had <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> lady's new house, or rather the improvement to her old one, and she had driven past it, and she did not altogether understand the state of affairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] she said, {{speaking}} aloud in her earnestness, [...] "I {{believe that}} that is what Miss Panney meant. She has spoken so well of him to me; she has <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> girl, and she said, yes, she certainly did say, 'It shall be done.' She wants it, I truly believe; she wants me to marry him." ...|$|E
60|$|BENNET [very quietly he turns, {{lets his}} eyes for a moment meet Fanny's. Then answers as he crosses to the windows]. The last I <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> her was <b>that</b> she was married.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{after this}} she {{announced}} that she meant to see Morris once {{to say good-bye to}} him before she went to London, and left me. Practically the next thing I <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> her was <b>that</b> she was dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But surely {{all these}} men cannot {{be guilty of}} great crimes," [...] Godfrey said, [...] "for I have <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> twenty {{thousand}} a year are sent away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It didn't {{take them}} long {{to learn that}} it wouldn't be {{possible}} for all to live if they all ate {{the same kind of}} food. So some learned to eat one thing and some another, and all went happily until there came a time when all food was scarce, and more stomachs were empty than full. You've <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> hard time and sad time?" ...|$|E
60|$|When {{they were}} through {{laughing}} Nimbleheels answered Old Mother Nature's questions. He {{explained that he}} had <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> school, as by this time almost every one in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows had. By chance he learned that Danny Meadow Mouse was attending. He thought {{that if it was}} a good thing for Danny it would be a good thing for him, so he had come.|$|E
6000|$|... "My brother, I mean. Look {{at the way}} {{he keeps}} staring at Maud. Edwin's awfully in love with Maud," [...] she rattled on with {{engaging}} frankness. [...] "At least, he thinks he is. He's {{been in love with}} a different girl every season since I came out. And now that Reggie Byng has gone and married Alice Faraday, he thinks he has a chance. You <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> I suppose?" ...|$|E
60|$|Euphemia and I exclaimed, {{with one}} voice, against this. We had just reached the most {{exciting}} part, and, I added, we had <b>heard</b> nothing yet <b>about</b> <b>that</b> affair of the taxes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Ayala! I {{am afraid}} that her other aunt, Aunt Tringle, was not as good to her as your wife. I have <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> how all <b>that</b> {{occurred}} in Rome. She was very much admired there. I am told that she is perfectly lovely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why! sure enough!" [...] {{cried the}} judge, [...] "we have <b>heard</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> extraordinary law of their being, already--nothing very definite, it is true, as regards dates and durations of power, but I {{see it is}} definite enough as regards to-night.
