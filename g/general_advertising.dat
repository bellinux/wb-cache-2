2500|$|After the Great Depression, {{which was}} blamed {{in part on}} a rise in {{speculative}} investments in unregulated small companies, startup investing was primarily a word of mouth activity reserved for the friends and family of a startup's co-founders, business angels and Venture Capital funds. In the United States {{this has been the}} case ever since the implementation of the Securities Act of 1933. Many nations implemented similar legislation to prohibit general solicitation and <b>general</b> <b>advertising</b> of unregistered securities, including shares offered by startup companies. In 2005, a new Accelerator investment model was introduced by [...] Y Combinator that combined fixed terms investment model with fixed period intense bootcamp style training program, to streamline the seed/early stage investment process with training to be more systematic.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately for him, General Bonaparte, {{then head}} of the Armée d'Italie, intercepted a royalist agent, Louis-Alexandre de Launay, comte d'Antraigues, in {{possession}} of documents revealing the conspiracy and the treason of Pichegru. He sent General Pierre Augereau and his army to Paris, where the <b>general</b> <b>advertised</b> the treason with posters in the streets. The principal conspirators were either arrested and deported to Guyana (like Pichegru and Barthélémy), or forced to flee (like Carnot and Vaublanc). The latter managed to escape the city limits of Paris, which was then still {{in a state of}} siege, by hiding in a carriage. This escape was achieved through the connivance of Rochambeau. Vaublanc made it to Italy with the help of various disguises; on his way he passed through Switzerland, where he stayed with his friend Pastoret.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{public attitudes}} towards advertising {{within the context}} of transition in central and eastern Europe. Drawing on a consumer survey conducted in three cities within Romania, the study conceptualises Pollay and Mittal's (1993) model of beliefs and attitudes towards advertising. This study introduces a novel differentiation between image and the social integration role of advertising, extending in this way the concept of the personal uses of advertising. It highlights variations in public opinion towards advertising between socio-cultural areas in Romania. Attitudes towards the institution of advertising, attitude-instrument, product information and hedonic/pleasure {{have a positive effect on}} <b>general</b> attitude to <b>advertising</b> as expected. Consumers who perceive an informational and entertaining value of advertising, those holding positive attitudes towards advertising as an institution in a free market economy and the instruments used to further it, are more likely to hold positive <b>general</b> attitudes towards <b>advertising.</b> The role of advertising exhibits a positive effect on general attitude. Image has a surprisingly negative effect on <b>general</b> attitude towards <b>advertising,</b> which contrasts with expectations based upon developed countries. Finally, the managerial implications are discussed...|$|R
