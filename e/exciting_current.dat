50|$|To obtain {{very quick}} torque control {{response}} in induction motor, it {{is required to}} suppress electromagnetic transients which might be caused by the control. Then {{it is necessary to}} investigate the electromagnetic transients of an induction motor. Within the induction motor, the largest inductance is the exciting inductance of exciting reactance. <b>Exciting</b> <b>current</b> flows there. If it is accompanied by any transient, delay time constant will be very large. it is necessary to avoid transients of <b>exciting</b> <b>current.</b> It is therefore necessary to maintain continuity of amplitude and phase of <b>exciting</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E
50|$|Herrera-May et al. {{fabricate}} {{a sensor}} with similar piezoresistive read-out approach but with different mechanical motion. Their sensor {{relies on the}} torsional motion of a micro-plate fabricated from silicon substrate. The <b>exciting</b> <b>current</b> loop contains 8 turns of aluminum coil. The location of the current loop enables a more uniform Lorentz force distribution compared with the aforementioned U-shape cantilever beam. The reported sensitivity is 403 mVrms/T with a resolution 143 nT.|$|E
50|$|The {{key point}} of FAM control {{is that the}} <b>exciting</b> <b>current</b> is kept {{constant}} in magnitude and continuous in the equivalent circuit. The speed of rotating air gap flux is made free or adjustable. This means that the magnetic field in the air gap is kept constant in its amplitude and that its speed is adjustable so that a desired value of torque is produced. When the air gap flux is kept constant, other variables like voltages, current and torque are functions of slip frequency only. By accelerating or decelerating rotation of the air gap flux to choose the slip frequency, the torque can be controlled as desired.|$|E

5000|$|Beroulle et al. have {{fabricated}} a U-shape {{cantilever beam}} on silicon substrate. Two piezo-resistors are {{laid on the}} support ends. There are 80-turns Al coil passing current along the U-shape beam. Wheatstone bridge is formed by connecting two [...] "active" [...] resistor with another two [...] "passive" [...] resistor free of strain. When there is an external magnetic field applying to the current carry conductor, motion of the U-shape beam will induce strain in two [...] "active" [...] piezo-resistors and thereby generating an output voltage across the Wheatstone bridge which {{is proportional to the}} magnetic field flux density. The reported sensitivity for this sensor is 530 m Vrms/T with a resolution 2 µT. Note that the frequency of the <b>exciting</b> <b>current</b> is set to be equal to the resonant frequency of the U-shape beam in order to maximize the sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|The {{focusing}} {{effect of}} a rotationally symmetrical magnetic field on the trajectory of electrons {{is the result of}} the complicated influence of a magnetic field on a moving electron. This effect is a force proportional to the induction B of the field and electron velocity v. The vector product of the radial component of induction Br and axial component of velocity va is a force perpendicular to those vectors, causing the electron to move around the axis. Additional effect of this motion in the same magnetic field is another force F oriented radially to the axis, which is responsible for the focusing effect of the magnetic lens. The resulting trajectory of electrons in the magnetic lens is a curve similar to a helix. In this context it should be mentioned that variations of focal length (<b>exciting</b> <b>current)</b> cause a slight rotation of the beam cross-section.|$|E
50|$|FAM {{control of}} {{induction}} motor torque has {{two types of}} control namely current control and voltage control. Constant <b>exciting</b> <b>current</b> produces good linearity’s between torque and slip frequency. In current control, the primary current is the control input to the induction motor whereas the primary terminal voltage is the control input in voltage control. Two transient phenomena are associated with induction motor operation. One is the mechanical transient of the dynamic system driven by induction motor {{and the other is}} the electromagnetic transient within the induction motor. In the first, speed and position of the motor shaft are state variables whereas in latter voltage, current, magnetic field are the state variables. Even though the two systems are interconnected but they can be treated separately. In numerical analysis of electromagnetic transients, it is assumed that the related dynamic state variables are constant and the instantaneous value of the motor torque is found and is fed into the analysis of transients in the dynamic system.|$|E

50|$|The main {{limitation}} of LWIR HgCdTe-based detectors {{is that they}} need cooling to temperatures near that of liquid nitrogen (77K), to reduce noise due to thermally <b>excited</b> <b>current</b> carriers (see cooled infrared camera). MWIR HgCdTe cameras can be operated at temperatures accessible to thermoelectric coolers with a small performance penalty. Hence, HgCdTe detectors are relatively heavy compared to bolometers and require maintenance. On the other side, HgCdTe enjoys much higher speed of detection (frame rate) and is significantly more sensitive than some of its more economical competitors.|$|R
