5|$|Akishio {{took part}} in the Pacific Reach 2000 <b>drills,</b> which took place from 2 to 14 October 2000, off of Singapore. The navies of the United States, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea took part. Because of the Kursk {{submarine}} disaster which had happened earlier that year, the Pacific Reach 2000 <b>drills</b> involved submarine rescue exercises, which Akishio performed in. This was the first time Japanese ships had taken part in a multilateral submarine rescue drill, although they had taken part in similar exercises bilaterally, with the US Navy. Japan's constitution places limits on their ability to perform collective-defence <b>drills.</b> Because of this, Japan joined the <b>drills</b> from a humanitarian standpoint, rather than a military one.|$|E

The Grand Fleet conducted a sweep into the central North Sea on 1719 May without encountering any German vessels. In mid-June, the fleet conducted another round of gunnery training. On 25 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery <b>drills.</b> Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo test a {{modified}} otologic <b>drill</b> under different <b>drilling</b> conditions {{for its ability}} to identify <b>drilling</b> faults and stop <b>drilling.</b> MethodsBased on force analysis and previous works, anotologic <b>drill</b> was modified and equipped with three sensors. Under various conditions, the <b>drill</b> was used to simulate three <b>drilling</b> faults and normal <b>drilling,</b> and signals from the <b>drill</b> were analyzed to extract the characteristic signal. A multi–sensor information fusion system and a stop program were designed to recognize <b>drilling</b> faults and stop <b>drilling.</b> ResultsSignals from each sensor changed consistently in response to <b>drilling</b> condition changes, with high repeatability and regularity. The average identification rate was 72. 625 %, 68. 575 %, 70. 5 % and 81. 3 % respectively for the three simulated <b>drilling</b> faults and normal <b>drilling.</b> The stop program stopped <b>drilling</b> in 0. 2 ~ 0. 3 seconds when a <b>drilling</b> faults was detected. ConclusionsThis study shows that the forces acting on the <b>drill</b> bit change predictably in the three simulated <b>drilling</b> conditions; that using suitable BP neural networks, the <b>drilling</b> faults can be reliably identified, and that a stop program based upon characteristic signal recognition can stop <b>drilling</b> quickly upon detecting <b>drilling</b> faults.
