40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>track</b> {{undergoes}} complex loading patterns under {{moving traffic}} conditions compared to roads {{due to its}} continued and discontinued multi-layered structure, including rail, sleepers, ballast layer, sub-ballast layer, and subgrade. Particle size distributions (PSDs) of ballast, subballast, and subgrade layers can be critical in cyclic plastic deformation of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> under moving traffic on frequent <b>track</b> degradation of <b>rail</b> <b>tracks,</b> especially at bridge transition zones. Conventional test approaches: static shear and cyclic single-point load tests are however unable to replicate actual loading patterns of moving train. Multi-ring shear apparatus; {{a new type of}} torsional simple shear apparatus, which can reproduce moving traffic conditions, was used in this study to investigate influence of particle size distribution of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> layers on cyclic plastic deformation. Three particle size distributions, using glass beads were examined under different loading patterns: cyclic sin-gle-point load, and cyclic moving wheel load to evaluate cyclic plastic deformation of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> under different loading methods. The results of these tests suggest that particle size distributions of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> structural layers have significant impacts on cyclic plastic deformation under moving train load. Further, the limitations in con-ventional test methods used in laboratories to estimate the plastic deformation of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> materials lead to underestimate the plastic deformation of <b>rail</b> <b>tracks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Precise {{assessment}} of cyclic plastic deformation of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> subgrade {{is essential in}} designing cost effective <b>rail</b> <b>tracks.</b> Plastic deformation of <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> is often underestimated due to the omission of effects of principal stress axis rotation and water content on subgrade deformation. Moisture content of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> subgrade is influenced by infiltration, seasonal ground water table variation and climate changes. To understand the influence of principal stress axis rotation and moisture content on the plastic deformation of soil, a series of cyclic moving wheel loading tests and cyclic triaxial compression tests were performed on unsaturated Toyoura sand, using a modified multi-ring shear apparatus. Results show {{that the presence of}} water in sand affects the cyclic plastic deformation of subgrade of <b>rail</b> <b>tracks,</b> significantly. The subgrade water content variation combined with the principal stress axis rotation further increases the accumulation of the cyclic plastic deformation of subgrade under moving wheel loads. Experimental results further conclude that the conventional experimental methods are unable to accurately assess the <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> deterioration process introduced by water content of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> subgrade under repeated moving wheel load and highlight the requirements of realistic test methods such as the cyclic moving load multi-ring shear test, the cyclic hollow cylindrical test, or the model test in predicting <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> deterioration process of unsaturated subgrade under moving wheel loads...|$|R
40|$|Construction of <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> {{requires}} appropriate improvement {{techniques for}} ballast and underlying soft formation soil, {{both of which}} deform and degrade progressively under heavy train loads. This paper aims to demonstrate and discuss some major aspects in relation to stabilisation of ballasted <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> overlaying soft formation soils. The use of geocomposites (i. e. bonded geogrid-geotextile layers) for enhancing the performance of <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> is described, {{with the aim of}} achieving reduced track settlement, increased resilient modulus and decreased ballast degradation. The effects of increasing the confining pressure on <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> in regard to particle breakage are studied using laboratory tests. The utilization of prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) to improve soft subgrade and provide better drainage system is introduced. Finite element analysis using an equivalent plane strain conversion is employed to predict settlements, excess pore pressures and lateral displacements under <b>rail</b> <b>tracks.</b> Finally, the use of native vegetation to stabilise soft formations of <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> is discussed, with the aid of preliminary suction models based on evapotranspiration mechanics applied to tree roots...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the automatic extraction of centerlines of railroads. Mobile Laser Scanning systems are able to capture the 3 D environment of the <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> {{with a high level}} of detail. Our approach first detects laser points that were reflected by the <b>rail</b> <b>tracks,</b> by making use of local properties such as parallelism and height in relation to neighboring objects. In the modeling stage, we present two approaches to determine the centerline location. The first approach generates center points in a data-driven manner by projecting <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> points to the parallel track, and taking the midpoint as initial center point. Next, a piecewise linear function is fitted through the center points to generate center points at a regular interval. The second approach models the <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> by fitting piecewise 3 D track models to the <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> points. The model consists of a pair of two parallel <b>rail</b> <b>tracks.</b> The fitted pieces are smoothened by a Fourier series interpolation function. After that the centerline is implicitly determined by the geometric center of the pair of tracks. Reference data has been used to analyze the quality of our results, confirming that the position of the centerlines can be determined with an accuracy of 2 – 3 cm...|$|R

40|$|German Rail {{maintains}} a global data base where all <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> information is managed in a consistent way. The data base {{is used as}} a reference frame for all facilities. However, rail maintenance work leads to geometrical changes in the situation. The same is true for <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> improvements with respect to a higher design speed. Both activities require updating concepts and procedures for the <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> data base which have to guarantee consistency and a high degree of up-to-date-ness. This is of special importance as all emergency management can only be based on such a valid <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> data base, and the ongoing building activities have to be synchronized with the maintenance activities resulting from the measurements.

40|$|Rail {{transport}} authorities {{around the}} world have been facing a significant challenge when predicting rail infrastructure maintenance work {{for a long period of}} time. Generally, maintenance monitoring and prediction is conducted manually. With the restrictions in economy, the rail transport authorities are in pursuit of improved modern methods, which can provide precise prediction of rail maintenance time and location. The expectation from such a method is to develop models to minimize the human error that is strongly related to manual prediction. Such models will help them in understanding how the track degradation occurs overtime under the change in different conditions (e. g. rail load, rail type, rail profile). They need a well-structured technique to identify the precise time that <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> fail in order to minimize the maintenance cost/time and secure the vehicles. The <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> characteristics that have been collected over the years will be used in developing <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> degradation prediction models. Since these data have been collected in large volumes and the data collection is done both electronically and manually, it is possible to have some errors. Sometimes these errors make it impossible to use them in prediction model development. This is one of the major drawbacks in <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> degradation prediction. An accurate model can play a key role in the estimation of the long-term behavior of <b>rail</b> <b>tracks.</b> Accurate models increase the track safety and decrease the cost of maintenance in long term. In this research, a short review of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> degradation prediction models has been discussed before estimating <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> degradation for the curve sections of Melbourne tram track system using Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model...|$|R
40|$|Ballasted <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} used <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> structure and to be {{designed to provide a}} stable, safe and economical foundation. Main components of ballasted <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> structure could be subdivided as track superstructure and track substructure. The loading from the train will be distributed from the superstructure to substructure. The main structural component of substructure is considered as track ballast which is generally crushed hard stones. Railway authorities specify gradation specifications for selection of ballast for <b>rail</b> <b>tracks.</b> Sri Lanka railways also specified a gradation limits in the selection of ballast for <b>rail</b> <b>tracks.</b> Current standard is closely resembled to the Indian <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> ballast specifications. Commonly, the ballast used in Sri Lanka is crushed gneiss rocks which are in abundance. It is well understood that granular materials derive its strength by resistance to shearing. However, there is no examination conducted to evaluate the performance of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> ballast used in Sri Lanka considering the shear behaviour. The objective of this preliminary study is to investigate the shear strength characteristics of ballast gradation used in Sri Lanka and compare with selected other ballast gradation specifications. Parallel gradation technique was used to model the sample as it is difficult to handle large size ballast in the conventional direct shear box. Direct shear tests were conducted under three normal pressures of 15 kPa, 45 kPa and 90 kPa on different ballast gradations including current Sri Lankan specification. The results showed that the Current Sri Lankan ballast gradation specification which is the same as Indian standard gradation has the highest shear strength compared to other ballast gradations tested...|$|R
