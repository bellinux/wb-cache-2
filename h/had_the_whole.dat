25|$|Later {{that summer}} Mackintosh petitioned for a Commission {{of fire and}} sword against Cameron, unsuccessfully at first but in 1663 he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of Clan Cameron {{declared}} outlaws. The commission against Cameron authorised various noblemen to implement it, but when approached by Mackintosh, they all told him to accept the financial compensation {{that had already been}} offered to him by Cameron. So Mackintosh decided to take matters into his own hands and having failed to induce his neighbours to join him, resorted to bribery to get them on his side. Meanwhile, in January 1665, the Duke of Rothes, Lord Chancellor of Scotland, ordered the Commission of Fire and Sword into abeyance until the Privy Council had decided what to do.|$|E

25|$|Rosenborg {{was still}} not Trondheim's {{dominant}} football team, and clubs such as Brage, Falken, Freidig, Kvik, Nidelv and Ranheim were still capable of beating Rosenborg on a good day. Rosenborg signed forward Tor Kleveland ahead of the 1963 season, and still <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> cup-winning team and Krogh, which made Rosenborg {{the most popular of}} the Trondheim teams. Up to 8,000 spectators would see matches at Lerkendal. The season ended with a third place, but afterwards Krogh transferred to Sweden's Högadal. Rosenborg again ended in third place in the league, behind Nidelv—the city's best team for the season. However, Rosenborg managed to reach the cup final, after beating Skeid in the round of 16, Vålerengen in the semi-finals, and won the cup after beating Sarpsborg 2–1 in the final. The season also saw a trip to Astrakhan in the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} {{hour or so}} of Full Metal Jacket, Stanley Kubrick's 1987 movie portraying the Vietnam War, Matthew Modine (Private Joker), Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother) and their platoon go into Huế, a Vietnamese city, to clear it of Viet Cong and snipers. Kubrick <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> {{gasworks}} selectively demolished and the art department then dressed the 'set' with latticework and appropriate advertising hoardings to make it believable. At one point the soldiers enter a building to flush out a sniper. This building {{was one of several}} located between the central buildings of the old gasworks and about 200 yards from the river Thames. The final scene sees the soldiers marching off into the (London) sunset against the silhouettes of the burning gasworks' chimneys and buildings, singing the Mickey Mouse March from the US children's TV show. In the film a period of several days takes place in the protagonist's lives as they travel through the industrial quarters of Huế city; in reality the action took place within just one square mile. According to Kubrick collaborator Leon Vitali, who worked on Full Metal Jacket, the gasworks were built by an architectural firm that also constructed much of Huế.|$|E
25|$|The split of 1955-56 largely {{involved}} tactical {{disagreements over}} how to move the UE's progressive program and brand of unionism forward {{in the face of}} the AFL-CIO merger. It proved a bitter disappointment to UE activists who had managed to bring the union successfully through the hardest years of the McCarthy period and the Cold War but who were now unable to keep the union together. Most locals in the UE's New York-north Jersey district (UE District 4) voted to go into the IUE reasoning that they had the strength and experience to influence the policies of the newer union. While this move was resented by UE activists elsewhere, especially in Pennsylvania and the midwest, the District 4 activists felt that the UE forces could soon have regained control of the re-united organization <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> union followed their lead. By the mid-1960s, the former UE activists in IUE shops played a role in helping to bring about James Carey's ouster in a disputed election. Carey's departure eventually opened the way for the co-ordinated bargaining which partially healed the two decade old division in the industry.|$|E

I called Jeff and said, 'Dude, guess what, we don't have to make the movie, we can just shoot the best parts.'" [...] "Shooting the trailer was so much fun," [...] Roth has stated, [...] "because every shot is a money shot. Every shot is decapitation or nudity. It's so ridiculous, it's absurd.

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Kim Manners, who was extremely pleased with the final result. He explained, [...] "it {{was a lot of}} fun to shoot that show. It was the first show that the Gunmen carried and I had a real good time shepherding Tommy, Dean, and Bruce, 'cause [...] they were nervous, they <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> hour to carry." [...] One scene with which Manners was extremely pleased was the shot wherein Susanne Modeski breaks into the Lone Gunmen's hotel room and the Gunmen cower in fear in a corner. Manners was inspired by the 1939 film adaption of The Wizard of Oz, most specifically the image of [...] " [...] the Scarecrow, and the Tinman, and the Lion [...] shaking behind Dorothy." [...] Manners later noted that the sequence [...] "really worked out well".|$|E
500|$|In the New York {{magazine}} {{review of}} the tour, Lindsay Zolatz commended the dancers, especially during [...] "Illuminati", writing {{that it was the}} [...] "most impressive" [...] part of the show, with [...] "some guys in top hats flying through the air on wobbly stilts that <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> audience gasping". Kitty Empire of The Guardian said, [...] "Madonna’s interludes are as good as the main event", and that the performance of [...] "Illuminati" [...] "finds seven dancers strapped to the top of tall, flexible poles, swaying precipitously". The Hollywood Reporter Ashley Lee said, [...] "Madonna's dancers served impressive spectacles that left the crowd gasping in awe, as they leaned wildly into the audience from atop ten-foot stilts. It's arguable that her changeover dance sequences and stunts are more entertaining than other performers' entire sets." [...] The performance at the March 19-20, 2016 shows in Sydney's Allphones Arena was recorded and released in Madonna's fifth live album, Rebel Heart Tour.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} March 2011, with Connie Britton {{first to be}} cast, portraying female lead Vivien Harmon. Britton stated that she took a risk in taking the role of Vivien. When Murphy presented the role to her, he said, [...] "This is something we've never seen you do before. It will be turning what you've just been doing on its ear." [...] She was intrigued by what he had presented her and ultimately {{decided to take the}} part. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, series co-creator Ryan Murphy stated that he had told Connie Britton, early on, that her character Vivien would die in the first season. [...] "We've really <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> season mapped out from the beginning," [...] he said. [...] "In the meetings with the core actors, the three leads being Connie, Dylan [...] and Jessica , as we tried to snare them we were able to say this is where you start, this is the middle, and this is where you end up. So, yes, I was able to tell Connie really the whole run of the series." ...|$|E

On The Village Voices year-end Pazz & Jop singles list, [...] "Single Ladies" [...] was ranked at numbers three and forty one in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Additionally, the Maurice Joshua Club Mix of the song was ranked at number 443 on the 2008 list. [...] "Single Ladies" [...] was named the best song of the 2000s decade by Black Entertainment Television (BET). Sarah Rodman, writing for The Boston Globe, named [...] "Single Ladies" [...] the fourth most irresistible song of the decade, and stated, [...] " [...] combined leotards with crass engagement-bling baiting into one delicious sexy-yet-antiquated package. The video <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> world dancing and waving along via YouTube." [...] VH1 ranked [...] "Single Ladies" [...] at number sixteen on its list of The 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s. In his book Eating the Dinosaur (2009), Chuck Klosterman wrote that [...] "Single Ladies" [...] is [...] "arguably the first song overtly marketed toward urban bachelorette parties". Jody Rosen of The New Yorker credited the melodies that float and dart over the thump for creating a new sound in music that didn't exist in the world before Beyoncé. He further wrote, [...] "If they sound 'normal' now, it's because Beyoncé, and her many followers, have retrained our ears." ...|$|E
