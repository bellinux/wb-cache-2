50|$|This {{relationship}} between the half-life and the decay constant shows that <b>highly</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>substances</b> are quickly spent, while those that radiate weakly endure longer. Half-lives of known radionuclides vary widely, from more than 1019 years, such as for the very nearly stable nuclide 209Bi, to 10âˆ’23 seconds for highly unstable ones.|$|E
40|$|There is {{definitely}} a technical possibility that atomic power may gradually develop {{into one of the}} principal sources of useful power. If this expectation will prove correct, great advantages can be expected to come {{from the fact that the}} weight of the fuel is almost negligible. This feature may be particularly valuable for making power available to regions of difficult access and far from deposits of coal. It also may prove a great asset in mobile power units for example in a power plant for ship propulsion. On the negative side there are some technical limitations to be applicability of atomic power of which perhaps the most serious is the impossibility of constructing light power units; also there will be some peculiar difficulties in operating atomic plants, as for example the necessity of handling <b>highly</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>substances</b> which will necessitate, at least for some considerable period, the use of specially skilled personnel for the operation. But the chief obstacle in the way of developing atomic power will be the difficulty of organizing a large scale industrial development in an internationally safe way. This presents actually problems much more difficult to solve than any of the technical developments that are necessary, It will require an unusual amount of statesmanship to balance properly the necessity of allaying the international suspicion that arises from withholding technical secrets against the obvious danger of dumping the details of the procedures for an extremely dangerous new method of warfare on a world that may not yet be prepared to renounce war. Furthermore, the proper balance should be found in the relatively short time that will elapse before the 'secrets' will naturally become open knowledge by rediscovery on part of the scientists and engineers of other countries...|$|E
2500|$|By 29 March iodine-131 {{levels in}} {{seawater}} 330m south {{of a key}} discharge outlet had reached 138Bq/ml (3,355 times the legal limit), and by 30 March, iodine-131 concentrations had reached 180Bq/ml at the same location near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, 4,385 times the legal limit. The high levels could be linked to a feared overflow of <b>highly</b> <b>radioactive</b> water that appeared to have leaked from the unit -2 turbine building. On 15 April, I-131 levels were 6,500 times the legal limits.

30|$|In recent years, {{inventory}} {{problems for}} deteriorating items {{have been widely}} studied. In general, deterioration {{is defined as the}} damage, spoilage, dryness, vaporization, etc., which decrease of usefulness of the commodity. One of the important problems in inventory management is how to control and maintain the inventories of deteriorating items such as food items, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and blood. Analysis of inventory system is usually carried out without considering the effects of deterioration; however, there are items such as <b>highly</b> volatile <b>substances,</b> <b>radioactive</b> materials, etc., in which the rate of deterioration should not be ignored (Valliathal and Uthayakumar 2011). Some researchers assume that the deterioration of the items in inventory starts from the instant of their arrival; however, many goods maintain freshness or original condition for a period of time. During this period deterioration would not take place. This phenomenon is defined as non-instantaneous deterioration.|$|R
