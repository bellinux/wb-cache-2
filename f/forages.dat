5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow <b>forages</b> {{slowly on}} or near the ground by walking or hopping under shrubs or dense grasses. Though it {{occasionally}} <b>forages</b> in weedy areas, it is almost never observed foraging in the open. It has occasionally been observed feeding in branches and low shrubs. During the breeding season, it gleans its food from grasses and low shrubs. However, normally the species obtains its food by either pecking or less frequently scratching at leaf litter. This bird tends to forage in a small family group and in a limited area.|$|E
40|$|Key words: herbivory; {{functional}} response; grazing; food intake; food quality; selectivity; cattle; savanna The functional response, {{defined as}} the relationship of <b>forage</b> intake with <b>forage</b> availability, is the principal link between a forager and a <b>forage</b> resource, and as such connects the trophic levels of consumers and producers. This thesis deals {{with the effects of}} <b>forage</b> resource structure on the shape of the functional response curve. Special attention was paid to the effects of the proportion of high quality <b>forage</b> within a heterogeneous <b>forage</b> resource, and of the spatial arrangement of high quality <b>forage</b> items within a matrix of low quality <b>forage</b> items. African Nguni cattle grazing stemmy, semi-arid grasslands were used as a model for large herbivores <b>foraging</b> in patches of heterogeneous <b>forage</b> resources. Decreasing the proportion of high quality <b>forage</b> decreased the asymptotic rate of <b>forage</b> intake and changed the shape of the functional response curve from a linear type I over an asymptotic type II to a dome-shaped type IV. Increased clustering of high quality <b>forage</b> items compensated for this decrease in <b>forage</b> intake to some extent. It is proposed that these effects result from the physical interference of low quality <b>forage</b> items with the cropping process in selective herbivores, thus connecting plant growth form with <b>foraging</b> behaviour. The generally negative relationship of <b>forage</b> availability with <b>forage</b> quality in natural grasslands suggests a dome-shaped functional response curve in the natural <b>foraging</b> situation, with low <b>forage</b> intake at high <b>forage</b> availability. However, because of pronounced spatial variation in <b>forage</b> availability and quality, foragers could utilise local <b>foraging</b> opportunities and achieved high <b>forage</b> intake and high diet quality even when on average <b>forage</b> availability was high and <b>forage</b> resource quality was low. Simulation models showed that such a system of a forager and a <b>forage</b> resource with variation in <b>forage</b> quality can reach different stable states, the major difference between these states being the exclusion or persistence of foragers in the system. It is further proposed that the spatial variation of <b>forage</b> availability and quality partially results from the local concentration of <b>foraging</b> efforts during times of plenty in a seasonally variable <b>forage</b> resource. This de facto resource partitioning can form the basis of species co-existence in herbivore assemblages, and can be useful in the management of species diversity in natural grasslands...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{partitioning}} {{within an}} assemblage of seven species of insectivorous birds inhabiting remnant Melaleuca woodland on Rottnest Island {{off the coast of}} Western Australia was studied during May-July 1993. <b>Foraging</b> behaviour, <b>foraging</b> height, <b>foraging</b> substrate and <b>foraging</b> plant associations of all species (and of both sexes in two species) were recorded for each month. These data were used to calculate overlaps in each <b>foraging</b> dimension and for all <b>foraging</b> dimensions combined. The significance of total <b>foraging</b> overlap between species and sexes (defined as overlap > 0. 6) was low in May (only 14 % of all total <b>foraging</b> overlaps) but increased slightly in June and July (25 and 29 % of all total <b>foraging</b> overlaps respectively). <b>Foraging</b> habits were associated significantly both with bird species and month of observation, indicating that <b>foraging</b> partitioning occurred and that its pattern varied temporally.

40|$|Lean season <b>foraging</b> {{strategies}} {{are critical for}} the survival of species inhabiting highly seasonal environments such as alpine regions. However, inferring <b>foraging</b> strategies is often difficult because of challenges associated with empirically estimating energetic costs and gains of <b>foraging</b> in the field. We generated qualitative predictions for the relationship between daily winter <b>foraging</b> time, body size and <b>forage</b> availability for three contrasting <b>foraging</b> strategies including time minimization, energy intake maximization and net energy maximization. Our model predicts that for animals employing a time minimization strategy, daily winter <b>foraging</b> time should not change with body size and should increase with a reduction in <b>forage</b> availability. For energy intake maximization, <b>foraging</b> time should not vary with either body size or <b>forage</b> availability. In contrast, for a net energy maximization strategy, <b>foraging</b> time should decrease with increase in body size and with a reduction in <b>forage</b> availability. We contrasted proportion of daily time spent <b>foraging</b> by bharal, Pseudois nayaur, a dimorphic grazer, across different body size classes in two high-altitude sites differing in <b>forage</b> availability. Our results indicate that bharal behave as net energy maximizers during winter. As predicted by the net energy maximization strategy, daily winter <b>foraging</b> time of bharal declined with increasing body size, and was lower in the site with low <b>forage</b> availability. Furthermore, as predicted by our model, <b>foraging</b> time declined as the winter season progressed. We did not find support for the time minimizing or energy intake maximizing strategies. Our qualitative model uses relative rather than absolute costs and gains of <b>foraging</b> which are often difficult to estimate in the field. It thus offers a simple way to make informed inferences regarding animal <b>foraging</b> strategies by contrasting estimates of daily <b>foraging</b> time across gradients of body size and <b>forage</b> availability...|$|R

40|$|Master of Science - SciencePositive affective states {{guide the}} {{proximate}} {{performance of the}} appetitive and consummatory components of behaviours, such as <b>foraging,</b> that ultimately increase an animal’s fitness. Accordingly, promoting <b>foraging</b> in captive animals can enhance their welfare, defined as a predominance of positive (e. g. pleasure) over negative (e. g. stress) affective states. In three sets of experiments, I examined social <b>foraging</b> in two captive baboon troops housed at the Johannesburg Zoo, South Africa. I investigated (1) whether watching a demonstrator baboon <b>forage</b> cued conspecific observers to also forage; (2) how two factors known to influence the social transfer of <b>foraging</b> information and the motivation to <b>forage</b> (demonstrator status and hunger/satiation respectively) affected whether an animal was cued to <b>forage</b> upon watching a demonstrator forage; (3) the psychological mechanism through which this change in motivation to <b>forage</b> occurred; and (4) how socially-cued <b>foraging</b> behaviour could be incorporated into environmental enrichment protocols. I recorded the frequency of <b>foraging</b> for individual baboons and for each troop as a whole. I also scored the incidence of aggression in both troops. Upon watching a demonstrator <b>forage</b> from a monopolisable food source, observers increased their <b>foraging</b> efforts elsewhere in the enclosure. Demonstrator identity influenced the incidence of <b>foraging</b> by observers, with how well the demonstrator predicted food reward, rather than its status per se, determining observer <b>foraging</b> frequency. The psychological mechanism mediating the increase in <b>foraging</b> behaviour, {{as well as the}} effect of observer hunger/satiation on <b>foraging,</b> were unclear.

40|$|The grass {{layer of}} savannas is {{characterized}} by strong temporal and spatial heterogeneity in {{the quantity and quality}} of <b>forage.</b> Besides this, there is strong variation in other aspects of sward structure, here defined as sward chemistry, morphology, architecture and species composition. The <b>forage</b> maturation hypothesis (FMH) is based on the temporal dynamics of <b>forage</b> quantity and quality of grasslands. Recently this hypothesis has been used to explain the <b>foraging</b> behaviour of large herbivores as an optimal solution for balancing <b>forage</b> ingestion and <b>forage</b> digestion, leading to a maximization of daily rates of <b>forage</b> intake in patches of intermediate <b>forage</b> quantity. However, so far studies using this hypothesis have been constrained to mono-specific <b>forage</b> resources or have ignored inter-patch variation in sward structure. We studied the <b>foraging</b> behaviour of cattle in a South African savanna. We explicitly addressed <b>forage</b> quantity and quality, and the structure of seven sward types in order to investigate (i) their effects on <b>foraging</b> behaviour; and (ii) the assumptions and predictions of the FMH for <b>foraging</b> behaviour in grasslands with pronounced variation in sward structure. The results indicated that the assumptions of the FMH were met and that <b>forage</b> quantity affected <b>forage</b> intake the most, with sward structure having little or no effect. The predicted maximum rate of daily <b>forage</b> intake agreed with the results of previous studies. However, the <b>forage</b> quantity at which this maximum intake rate was found, was larger than expected based on the results of some studies.

40|$|Wide-ranging marine {{central place}} foragers often exhibit <b>foraging</b> site {{fidelity}} to oceanographic features over differing spatial scales (i. e., localized coastal upwellings and oceanic fronts). Few studies have tested how {{the degree of}} site fidelity to <b>foraging</b> areas varies {{in relation to the}} type of ocean features used. In order to determine how <b>foraging</b> site fidelity varied between continental shelf and oceanic <b>foraging</b> habitats, 31 lactating New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus australis forsteri 1) were satellite tracked over consecutive <b>foraging</b> trips (14 – 108 d).
