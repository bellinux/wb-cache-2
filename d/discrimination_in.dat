5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date.

The early actions have been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E

The results show that the dorsal prestriate area has a more general role in visuospatial processing than was known hitherto, and they suggest that it interacts with the hippocampal formation and fornix in visuospatial memory tasks...|$|R

Group C, in which rats were required to choose the same goal box when the original positive stimulus or the negative one was presented on the entrance of each goal box, learned shift problems faster than Group IC, in which rats were required to choose the right goal box when one of positive stimuli was presented and to choose the left goal box when the other was presented as well as negative stimuli, after overtraining, but not after criterion training. In Experiment 2, rats were trained on two <b>discriminations</b> <b>in</b> the Y maze, {{and then they were}} trained on either whole reversal (Group W) in which two tasks were reversed or partial reversal (Group P) in which one of two tasks was reversed in a straight runway.
