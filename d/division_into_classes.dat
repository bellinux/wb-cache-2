In {{order to}} {{conceive}} correctly {{the scope of}} this general science, and distinguish it from the subordinate departments of sociological speculation, it is necessary to fix the ideas attached to the phrase, “A State of Society.” What is called a state of society, is the simultaneous state of all the greater social facts or phenomena. Such are: the degree of knowledge, and of intellectual and moral culture, existing in the community, and in every class of it; the state of industry, of wealth and its distribution; the habitual occupations of the community; their <b>division</b> <b>into</b> <b>classes,</b> and the relations of those classes to one another; the common beliefs which they entertain on all the subjects most important to mankind, and the degree of assurance with which those beliefs are held; their tastes, and the character and degree of their æsthetic development; their form of government, and the more important of their laws and customs. The condition of all these things, and of many more which will readily suggest themselves, constitute the state of society, or the state of civilization, at any given time.|$|E
60|$|The {{object of}} the <b>division</b> <b>into</b> <b>classes</b> is instruction. Whenever it is {{desirable}} that several individuals should pursue a particular study, a list of their names is made out, a book selected, a time for recitation assigned, a teacher appointed, and the exercises begin. In this way {{a large number of}} classes have been formed, and the wishes of parents or the opinion of the Principal, and in many cases that of the pupil, determines how many and what shall be assigned to each individual. A list of these classes, with {{the average age of the}} members, the name of the teacher, and the time of recitation, is posted in a conspicuous place, and public notice is given whenever a new class is formed. You will therefore have the opportunity to know all the arrangements of school in this respect, and I wish you to exercise your own judgment and discretion a great deal, in regard to your studies. I do not mean I expect you to decide, but to reflect upon them. Look at the list, and consider what am most useful for you. Propose to me or to your parents, changes, whenever you think any are necessary; and when you finish one study, reflect carefully, yourself, on the question what you shall next commence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the basic {{research}} of cyclic damage during {{the initial stages of}} fatigue process using the non-destructive testing methods. The acoustic emission method was used for monitoring of the microstructure changes during fatigue loading. The electrical potential measurements of specimen and microscopic observation were used mainly to detect the first short cracks and their propagation. The fatigue tests at room temperature were conducted on titanium alloy and creep-resistant steel specimens under bending and tension loading. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the acoustic emission signal at different types of loading until fracture and to analyze in detail the signal changes in initial stages of fatigue process. This analysis was primarily based on the waveform similarity and <b>division</b> <b>into</b> <b>classes.</b> The results show the high sensitivity of the acoustic emission technology in the transition from the stage of surface relief evolution to the stage of crack nucleation and propagation...|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{an attempt}} at determinations of correlations existing between the social activity and the social structure. The social activity may represent a category of description of particular segnents of the social structure, and {{it can also be}} treated as one of mechanisms of changes in the social structure. Previous propositions of classification of participation in the social activity seem to be insufficient with the present stąte of researches on the social structure, which takes into consideration not only <b>division</b> <b>into</b> <b>classes</b> and social strata but also differentiation within big social groups. Therefore, it becomes necessary to perform a more precise taxonomy of participation in the social activity. The author proposes that the following classification criteria should be employed: 1. Membership in social and political organizations. 2. Co-operation with social organizations not based on membership principles. 3. Role of participation in activities of an organization ("ordinary member", tasks performer, co-organizer of activities). 4. Number of organizations with which one co-operates.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an adaptive content-based image denoising technique. This technique uses image area classification for two purposes: perform more precise filtering and decrease computation complexity compared to modern filters {{of the same}} quality performance. Overview of several top image filtering techniques was made. Spatial domain (LPA-ICI), transform domain (SW-DCT) and combined filters (SA-DCT and BM 3 D) were studied {{in order to understand}} basic principles of image denoising. Image area classification which gives reasonable <b>division</b> <b>into</b> <b>classes</b> with clearly distinguishable properties for image filtering was observed. We have chosen block-wise classification that maps each block to Texture, Smooth and Edge classes. Performance of discussed filters on image area classes was shown. Adaptive free parameters choise for filtering quality improvement was analysed. It was shown that for some classes best parameters set differs from the best parameter set for the entire image. Methods to improve denoising algorithms speed which we were using in our adaptive solution were proposed. The most suitable algorithms with appropriate parameters set for each image area class were chosen. Modi ed classi cation algorithm applied to noisy images was developed. Whereupon, a modi ed BM 3 D-based adaptive denoising algorithm was proposed. Finally, multiple tests were performed and verification of speed and quality performances improvement compared to a baseline BM 3 D algorithm was obtained...|$|E
