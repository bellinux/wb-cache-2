50|$|Platanthera leucophaea, {{commonly}} known as the prairie white fringed orchid or <b>eastern</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid,</b> is a rare species of orchid native to North America.

50|$|Platanthera praeclara {{arises from}} a fleshy tuber. It grows from 38 to 85 cm tall. Each plant can {{have up to}} two dozen or more flowers {{arranged}} in a stalk. P. praeclara is distinguished from Platanthera leucophaea, the <b>eastern</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid,</b> by its slightly larger flowers, petal shape, and longer nectar spur.|$|E
50|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid</b> is a {{long-lived}} perennial. Its tuberous rootstalk helps it survive grass fires. Fires {{and rain}} stimulate {{the plant to}} grow and flower. The plant emerges each year in May and flowering begins by late June. The flowers are pollinated at night by large sphinx moths. Certain night-flying insects that are attracted to the orchid's fragrance are able to obtain its nectar with their long probosces. Others cannot because of the flower's long, narrow, oddly positioned nectar spur.|$|E

40|$|A yet {{unresolved}} {{question in}} orchid biology is whether mycorrhizal fungi (= mycobionts) utilized as a carbon source by young seedlings (= protocorms) {{are different from}} those utilized by adult plants. This is the first report documenting the protocorm mycobionts of the Federally threatened <b>eastern</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid,</b> Platanthera leucophaea, and the first report describing a technique to culture mycotrophic seedlings to the green leaf stage. Seeds of P. leucophaea placed in retrievable nylon mesh packets were sown at Hildy Prairie (Grundy Co.), Illinois in November, 2000 and recovered in August, 2002. All resulting protocorms yielded mycobionts assignable to Ceratorhiza goodyerae-repentis (Costantin & Dufour) Moore - the same anamorphic fungus recovered from mature P. leucophaea plants in previous studies. Protocorms cultivated in vitro with a Ceratorhiza mycobiont were placed on a substrate of sand, activated charcoal, and modified oats medium and subjected to chilling (6 ºC) in darkness, followed by exposure to a 12 h photoperiod (L : D, 12 h : 12 h) at 24 ºC. Leaf length accelerated after the second week of incubation in light. Green leaf color became evident during the photoperiod implying that seedlings were capable of photosynthesis. Seedlings also maintained a mycotrophic capability evidenced by the presence of fungal pelotons in root-like organs. This study has significant merit for conservation by providing a protocol for P. leucophaea’s cultivation, and by underscoring the importance of C. goodyerae-repentis in the prairie ecosystem...|$|E

40|$|Western <b>prairie</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid</b> (Platanthera praeciara Sheviak and Bowles) populations at {{one time}} {{extended}} from southwestern Missouri north to northwestern Minnesota, and from eastern Iowa to the Sandhills of north central Nebraska. It is listed as endangered in Iowa and Minnesota and candidate for threatened or endangered status in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. The questions are, 2 ̆ 2 Why has it declined in numbers? 2 ̆ 2 How have uses such as mowing for hay or grazing by cattle or no use (control) affected the numbers? In 1987, permanently located individual plants were counted on the Sheyenne National Grasslands of southeastern North Dakota. Population trends of this orchid were compared regarding effects of mowing, grazing, and fire. The evaluation of the permanently located individual plants, and data on total counts per area in 1988 showed a difference between years and significant difference among grazed, mowed, or no use treatments.

40|$|A small, {{isolated}} {{population of}} the threatened western <b>prairie</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid</b> (Platanthera praeclara Sheviak & Bowles) occurs at Pipestone National Monument, Minnesota, in a mesic prairie that is periodically burned to control invasive cool-season grasses. During 1995 - 2004, monitoring counts of flowering orchids in the monument varied considerably for different years. Similar precipitation amounts {{in the spring and}} histories of burning suggest that fire and precipitation in the spring were not the causes of the variation. For the eight non-burn years in the monitoring record, we compared the number of flowering plants and the precipitation amounts during six growth stages of the orchid and found a 2 -variab 1 e model (precipitation during senescence/bud development and precipitation in the dormant period) explained 77 % of the annual variation in number of flowering plants. We also conducted a fire experiment in early May 2002, the typical prescribed burn period for the monument, and found that the frequency of flowering, vegetative, and absent plants observed in July did not differ between burned and protected locations of orchids. We used the model and forecasts of precipitation in the spring to develop provisional burn decision scenarios. We discussed management implications of the scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The western <b>prairie</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid,</b> Platanthera praeclara (Sheviak & Bowles), is an {{endangered}} species in North America. In Manitoba orchids produce lower numbers of seed capsules than more southern populations. Exploration of the pollination biology for P. praeclara is critical to preserve this endangered species. This study identified the pollinators of P. praeclara using cone and malaise traps and tested the effectiveness of marking pollinators with traces of Day-Glow® orange marker powder. Although Lepidoptera were numerous in orchid plots during daily observation periods, including day flying Sphingidae, none were pollinators for P. praeclara. Among the 5856 insects from 49 families captured over 45 trapping days, six sphinx moths, two specimens of Hyles gallii (Rottenburg) and four specimens of Sphinx drupiferarum J. E. Smith (Sphingidae), were found with two or more orchid pollinia attached to their eyes and were confirmed as pollinators of P. praeclara. S. drupiferarum is uncommon in southern Manitoba and H. gallii {{appears to be a}} less efficient pollinator than S. drupiferarum. Proboscis length, eye width and flight period may influence the efficiency of biotic pollination of the orchid.
