5|$|A few teleosts are dangerous. Some, like eeltail catfish (Plotosidae), scorpionfish (Scorpaenidae) or {{stonefish}} (Synanceiidae) have venomous spines {{that can}} seriously injure or kill humans. Some, like the electric eel and the <b>electric</b> <b>catfish,</b> {{can give a}} severe electric shock. Others, such as the piranha and barracuda, have a powerful bite and have sometimes attacked human bathers. Reports indicate {{that some of the}} catfish family can be large enough to prey on human bathers.|$|E
25|$|All catfish, except {{members of}} Malapteruridae (<b>electric</b> <b>catfish),</b> possess a strong, hollow, bony leading spine-like ray on their dorsal and {{pectoral}} fins. As a defense, these spines may be locked into place {{so that they}} stick outwards, which can inflict severe wounds. In several species catfish can use these fin rays to deliver a stinging protein if the fish is irritated. This venom is produced by glandular cells in the epidermal tissue covering the spines. In {{members of the family}} Plotosidae, and of the genus Heteropneustes, this protein is so strong it may hospitalize humans who are unfortunate enough to receive a sting; in Plotosus lineatus, the stings may result in death.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{fish are}} capable of {{generating}} an external electric fields or receive electric fields (electroreception). Electric fish can be further divided into three categories: strongly discharging, weakly discharging, and fish that sense but is unable to generate electric fields. Strongly electric fish generate strong electric field up to 500 volts for predatory purposes; Strongly electric fish include both marine and fresh water fishes (two freshwater taxa- African <b>electric</b> <b>catfish</b> (Malapterurus electricus) and the Neotropical electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) and the marine torpedo rays (Torpedo)). Weakly electric fish generates electric fields mainly for communication and electrolocation purposes; weakly electric fish are found in fresh water only and includes African freshwater Mormyridae and Gymnarchus and Neotropical electric knifefishes. Lastly, fish that are only able to detect electrical signals includes sharks, rays, skates, catfishes, {{and a number of}} other groups (see Electroreception).|$|E

5000|$|Strongly {{electric}} {{fish are}} fish with an EOD that is {{powerful enough to}} stun prey. Typical examples are the electric eel, the <b>electric</b> <b>catfishes,</b> and <b>electric</b> rays. The amplitude of the signal can range from 10 to 600 volts with a current of up to 1 ampere, according to the surroundings, for example different conductances of salt and fresh water. To maximize the power delivered to the surroundings, the impedances of the electric organ and the water must be matched: ...|$|R

5|$|His {{observations}} on <b>catfish,</b> <b>electric</b> fish (Torpedo) and angler fish are detailed, {{as is his}} writing on cephalopods including the octopus, cuttlefish and the paper nautilus. His claim that the octopus had a hectocotyl arm which was perhaps used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved, until its rediscovery in the 19th century.

50|$|Aristotle is the {{earliest}} natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle certainly did {{research on the}} natural history of Lesbos, and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research, the History of Animals, Generation of Animals, Movement of Animals, and Parts of Animals, contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on <b>catfish,</b> <b>electric</b> fish (Torpedo) and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on cephalopods, namely, Octopus, Sepia (cuttlefish) and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo). His description of the hectocotyl arm, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century.

50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>catfish</b> is {{the common}} name for the catfish (order Siluriformes) family Malapteruridae. This family {{includes}} two genera, Malapterurus and Paradoxoglanis with 19 species. Several species of this family {{have the ability to}} produce an electric shock of up to 350 volts using electroplaques of an electric organ. <b>Electric</b> <b>catfish</b> are found in tropical Africa and the Nile River. <b>Electric</b> <b>catfish</b> are usually nocturnal and carnivorous. Some species feed primarily on other fish, incapacitating their prey with electric discharges, but others are generalist bottom forager, feeding on things like invertebrates, fish eggs and detritus. The largest can grow to about 1.2 m long, but most species are far smaller.|$|E
5000|$|Later, {{during the}} fourth century BC, another Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC) {{attempted}} a comprehensive classification of animals which included systematic descriptions of many marine species, and particularly species found in the Mediterranean Sea. These pioneering works include History of Animals, a general biology of animals, Parts of Animals, a comparative anatomy and physiology of animals, and Generation of Animals, on developmental biology. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on <b>catfish,</b> <b>electric</b> fish (Torpedo) and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on cephalopods, namely, Octopus, Sepia (cuttlefish) and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo). His description of the hectocotyl arm, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays {{were part of a}} group he called Selachē (selachians). He gave accurate descriptions of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark Mustelus mustelus. His classification of living things contains elements which were still in use in the 19th century. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called [...] "animals with blood" [...] and [...] "animals without blood" [...] (he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of hemoglobin, but of a different kind from vertebrates). He divided animals with blood into live-bearing (mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates ("animals without blood") he divided into insects, crustacea (further divided into non-shelled - cephalopods - and shelled) and testacea (molluscs).|$|R
