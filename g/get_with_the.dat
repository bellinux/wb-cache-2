500|$|Critics {{had similar}} {{opinions}} of other versions. Mean Machines Sega described {{the game as}} [...] "the most complex Megadrive game ever created", and eulogised playability and longevity, but criticised the behaviour of the handymen. CU Amiga praised the addictiveness of the Amiga version, and called the game [...] "colourful". The visuals were likewise commended by Jeuxvideo.com on the PC and Macintosh versions, and the British humour was complimented as well. German magazine Mega Fun compared the SNES version to the Mega Drive version, and said the SNES version had better controls and music, creating atmosphere. Reviewing the PlayStation version, Maximum said that the game [...] "is {{probably one of the}} best sim games around. It manages {{to strike a balance between}} in-depth game play and personality, which you don't <b>get</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> more brow-furrowing games of this genre", although the only improvement being a view option was cited as a disappointment.|$|E

I disagree. What is more, I think banks that are not prepared for such new competitors face certain death." [...] The banking industry recognizes BBVA to be more pro-technology than many of its competitors.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{generally}} gave high {{remarks to}} the game's physics system. [...] Brett Todd of GameSpot called the physics [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "first-rate" [...] and added [...] "the ball rolls, spins, and bounces {{like it has}} real weight." [...] Destructoid's Brad Nicholson praised the game's [...] "lifelike pinball physics and [...] multiplayer options." [...] Daemon Hatfield of IGN stated that although no virtual table could perfectly replicate gameplay on a real table, he stated that [...] "Zen Pinball makes up for that with new features that you don't <b>get</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> real thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Alley has {{inspired}} professional {{artists such as}} Matthew Hoffman. On {{the east end of}} the alley, up high on the north-facing wall, a giant self-portrait of Hoffman titled [...] "Projectbubble Gum" [...] is created entirely with bubble gum. The picture of the artist blowing a bubble required a tremendous amount of gum, which he was able to <b>get</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> help of the community. His theory is, [...] "if an individual participates in their community they will earn an invested interest in their community. The community chewed the bubblegum, and many individuals [...] as though they were a part of its creation. This instills a sense of stewardship in one’s community". Even the robotics Team 1717, featured in the book The New Cool, is depicted in neon blue gum.|$|E
2500|$|On August 6, 2013, Taco Bell {{announced}} it was expanding its test market of waffle tacos to about 100 restaurants in Fresno, California, Omaha, Nebraska and Chattanooga, Tennessee, starting August 8. The waffle taco includes scrambled eggs, sausage and a side of syrup. It was the top selling item during breakfast hours at the five Southern California restaurants where they were tested earlier in 2013. The breakfast menu started on March 27, 2014. Other items include A.M. Crunchwrap, Cinnabon Delights, breakfast burrito, A.M. grilled sausage flatbread melt, hash browns, coffee and orange juice. The ad campaign which began March 27 used twenty-five men who were named Ronald McDonald, {{a reference to the}} famous clown of a rival chain. Another commercial advertising the Waffle Taco has the narrator singing [...] "I've been eating Egg McMuffins since 1984. [...] But when I saw Taco Bell made a Waffle Taco, I figured I would <b>get</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> times" [...] set to the tune of [...] "Old MacDonald Had a Farm", another shot at the rival hamburger chain.|$|E

If you ever slide into him head first--good-bye! He's a great player, and he can hit {{any kind of a}} ball. MacNeff now, just as you said, is weak on a high ball close in, and he kills a low ball. Kills is the word! He hits them a mile. But, Peg, I think you're a little off on Keene, Starke, and Martin, the other Place cracks. They're veterans, hard to pitch to; they make you cut the plate; they are as apt to bunt as hit, and they are fast. They keep a fellow guessing. I think Starke pulls a little on a curve, but the others have no weakness I ever discovered. But, Peg, I expect you to do more with them than I did. My control was never any too good, and you can throw almost as straight as a fellow could shoot a rifle. Then your high fast ball, that one you <b>get</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> long swing, it would beat any team. Only I'm wondering, I'm asking--can you use it right along, {{in the face of such}} coaching and yelling and hitting as you'll run against to-day? I'm asking deliberately, because I want to give you confidence." ...|$|E

50|$|In these models, two {{mechanisms}} are at work. For example, {{the rule in}} English for forming a past-tense form is to add -ed. In cases where the recall from memory instantly retrieves the form, the brain {{does not need to}} execute the rule, and skips execution. In cases where retrieval doesn't happen fast enough, the rule is executed. The more practice <b>the</b> speaker <b>gets</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> language, the more reliable is the retrieval.|$|R

"When {{we got to}} {{that place}} I got out and went and leaned my elbows on a low stone wall which {{enclosed}} a turfy and beautiful great field with heavy wood on all its sides except ours. Mrs. Blank sat in the dog-cart fifty yards away, which was as near as she could <b>get</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. I was full of interest, for I {{had never seen a}} fox-hunt. I waited, dreaming and imagining, in the deep stillness and impressive tranquility which reigned in that retired spot. Presently, from away off in the forest on the left, a mellow bugle-note came floating; {{then all of a sudden}} a multitude of dogs burst out of that forest and went tearing by and disappeared in the forest on the right; there was a pause, and then a cloud of horsemen in black caps and crimson coats plunged out of the left-hand forest and went flaming across the field like a prairie-fire, a stirring sight to see. There was one man ahead of the rest, and he came spurring straight at me. He was fiercely excited. It was fine to see him ride; he was a master horseman. He came like a storm till he was within seven feet of me, where I was leaning on the wall, then he stood his horse straight up in the air on his hind toe-nails, and shouted like a demon: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{was going}} to say that even those Germans are not so dear as they are in the fatherland, though rude. They do not tend much if at all to tables d'hôte, but the Italians and the French who do, serve you a better meal for a lower price than you would get in Paris, or Rome, or Naples. There the {{prevalent}} ideal is five francs, with neither wine nor coffee included. I'll allow that the cheap table d'hôte is mainly the affair of single men and women, and does not merit the consideration I've given it. If it helps a young couple to do with one maid, or with none, instead of two, it makes for cheapness of living. Service is costly and it is greedy, and except in large households its diet {{is the same as the}} family's, so that anything which reduces it is a great saving. But the table d'hôte which is cheap for one or two is not cheap for more, and it is not available if there are children. Housing and raw-provisioning and serving are the main questions, and in Europe the first and last are apparently much less expensive. Marketing is undoubtedly cheaper with us, and if you count in what you <b>get</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> newness, the wholesomeness, and handiness of an American flat, the rent is not so much greater than that of a European flat, with its elementary bareness. You could not, here, unless you descended from the apartment to the tenement, hire any quarter where you would not be supplied with hot and cold water, with steam heating, with a bath-room, and all the rest of it." ...|$|E
