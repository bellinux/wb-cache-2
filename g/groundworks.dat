5|$|During 1890 {{work began}} on an eighth fort, known as Linkuva; new {{construction}} techniques were introduced, particularly reinforced concrete. The Linkuva fort {{became the most}} modern entrenchment, equipped with electricity, sewerage, and casemates for a garrison of 1,000 personnel. At the same time, massive <b>groundworks</b> were laid along with additional defensive structures, effecting the complete enclosure of the city center between the Rivers Nemunas and Neris. By 1890, seven forts had been completed, supporting roads had been constructed, and a railroad bridge over the Nemunas had been adapted for military transport. By now, expenditures on the fortress had amounted to over nine million rubles. The first bricks for a church that would serve the garrison were laid in 1891; it was completed in 1893. The following year construction began on a dedicated narrow gauge railway.|$|E

Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the <b>groundworks</b> for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stowe House in {{the parish}} of Kilkhampton in Cornwall, England, UK, was a [...] mansion built in 1679 by John Grenville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628-1701) and {{demolished}} in 1739. The Grenville family were for many centuries lords of the manor of Kilkhampton, which they held from the feudal barony of Gloucester, as they did their other principal seat of nearby Bideford in Devon. It {{is possible that the}} family's original residence at Kilkhampton was Kilkhampton Castle, of which only the <b>groundworks</b> survive, unusual in that it had a motte with two baileys.|$|E
2500|$|Greene {{recognizes the}} [...] "great bases" [...] of line 3 to be a manor house which carry over into his {{understanding}} of the Second Quatrain. According to Greene, this [...] "manor house is faintly sustained by [...] "ruining", [...] "dwellers", [...] "rent", and the possible allusion to compound and simple interest". This economic terminology transforms the actions of the suitors into a sort of currency that is spent too quickly. In line 7, the compound sweet is seen by Greene as an artificial confection or overwrought style of poetry in great use by the other suitors who are themselves poets. It is a reference to Sonnet 76 in [...] "which the poet reproached himself for omitting it from his own verse". The symbolism behind dwellers and rent is meant to show {{that a large number of}} people are offering grand gestures of affection with nothing to show for it in the end. There is no returned investment when you rent a property, because the owner receives and retains all of the expense you put into it. Greene puts a great deal of meaning to the closing line of the Second Quatrain. According to Greene, the word [...] "spent" [...] means bankrupted, exhausted, and failed while also referring to being [...] "drained of semen". He sums this up by adding, [...] "Unsuccessful entrepreneurs, with only the <b>groundworks</b> built of their mansion of love, the failure of their misguided, formalist generosity is symbolized by the suitors' symbolic distance from their prize, observable but not touchable". The suitors are [...] "pittifull thrivors" [...] who have expended so much to win affection only to find themselves wanting.|$|E

40|$|In Dutch Design and Technology Education the {{beginning}} of a process of learning is usually determined by the teacher. In this paper it is argued that a beginning, determined in interaction with the students, is more profitable as the interaction will lead to joined-up exploring, creating and thinking and an increased motivation to learn. Furthermore, students are empowered to treat an activity as a means rather than an end. The interaction acts as <b>groundwork</b> in advance of the assignment. <b>Groundwork</b> is something that is done at an early stage and that makes later work or progress possible. Literature does however not cover the <b>groundwork</b> topic for children in the four-eight year age bracket. Therefore a model for the <b>groundwork</b> phase, consisting of five components, was designed and tested. The components are: context, communication, integration of acting and thinking, presentation of instruction and presentation of the problem. In this paper two case-studies, which handle <b>groundwork</b> in different ways, are described. The <b>groundwork</b> was in both cases addressed in group activities, aiming to prepare students to commence a process of learning. The cases show that, when used in combination, the five components appear to make <b>groundwork</b> successful. Careful communication gave added value. A communication link was configured between teacher and learner, between learners, and between subject and learner. Through <b>groundwork</b> the teacher shared both thoughts and knowledge with the students and this created a base for effective classroom communication and a common approach.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to outline recent trend and a new {{approach}} of <b>Groundwork</b> movement in the UK, especially focusing on new programme for low-carbon society and social inclusion through establishing social enterprise. Characteristics of development strategy of <b>Groundwork</b> are 1) making a project by matching national policy through a holistic approach, 2) developing a financially independent project in niche market and then setting up a subsidiary as social enterprise and 3) reforming a multilayered national network by <b>Groundwork</b> trusts and subsidiaries. <b>Groundwork</b> has established a type of operation model for non-profit organisation in community development and has been one of the largest bodies in the UK. Its next step is similar to establish an operation model for social enterprise through the <b>Groundwork</b> mechanism and network. It is expected to create an alternative body for regeneration in British society and to regenerate more employment in the intermediate labour market...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{consider}} characteristics of workings and a future direction of local partnership groups in Japan based on the <b>Groundwork</b> approach in the UK. Compared with <b>Groundwork</b> in the UK, characteristics of workings of local <b>Groundwork</b> groups in Japan are summarised as follows: 1) an approach to matters of natural environment in the local community; 2) simple programme contents; 3) a practical activity only by <b>Groundwork</b> group; 4) a vulnerable partnership with the private sector; 5) a support system by volunteer staff with high skill; 6) a low capacity of fund raising and a small fiscal scale; 7) a passive strategy toward government policies. In conclusion, the following four points are necessary for developing <b>Groundwork</b> movement in Japan: 1) a step-by-step approach to enhance social environment; 2) an intermediary to expand a local partnership; 3) an organisational structure composed of full-time staffs with a coordination skill and diversification of finance; 4) a consciousness of a holistic approach strategy...|$|R

5000|$|According to Seung's investigation, it {{has been}} the most grievous long-standing mistake in the study of Kant's ethics to assume that he has espoused no other moral theory than his formalistic ethics and that the <b>Groundwork</b> is his most {{important}} work in ethics. Prior to the <b>Groundwork,</b> according to Seung, Kant had embraced Platonic Ideas as the foundation of his ethics in his Inaugural Dissertation of 1770 and reaffirmed his Platonic allegiance in the Critique of Pure Reason (1781). [...] In his <b>Groundwork,</b> Kant had to abandon his Platonic ethics because he designed his ethical formalism as a Copernican revolution in ethics. [...] In distinction from this new position, Seung labels Kant's Platonic ethics his ethical Platonism. This version of his ethics had never been recognized until it was uncovered by Seung. He has further shown that Kant did not sustain his ethical formalism very long after the <b>Groundwork.</b> In Critique of Practical Reason, Kant may appear to retain his formalistic framework, but he injects Platonic content into this framework. [...] That was only three years later than the <b>Groundwork.</b>|$|R
