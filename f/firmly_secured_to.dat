500|$|The CSMIP Cape Mendocino {{station was}} {{installed}} in 1978 and was located just [...] from the epicenter on the slope of a ridge in the coast ranges. The instruments there had been mounted on a concrete platform adjacent to a roadway and remained <b>firmly</b> <b>secured</b> <b>to</b> the rock platform following the shocks. A landslide came within [...] of the device and left debris on the road, but a lack of large rocks close to the instrument and no cracking of the rocks near the platform left geologists with no clear explanation for the extraordinarily high vertical component reading of 1.85g. The tri-axial analog accelerometer that was in use was physically limited to that value and all three traces had uniformly significant values at three seconds into the recording. A post-earthquake lab test of the seismometer and an inspection of the photographically enlarged accelerogram revealed that the limit was hit twice, with a maximum deflection of 31mm, as the needle bounced off the unit's mass. An extrapolation of the vertical record led to a maximum acceleration estimate of 2.2g for that site, and the unit was eventually replaced with a higher capacity digital device.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Eversley told me afterwards, however, {{that the}} Kalubis had a {{tradition}} that the god once possessed a wife which died before the Pongo migrated to their present home. If so, these {{may have been the}} bones of that wife. When it was finally clear of the ground on which it had grown for so many generations, the great plant was lifted on to a large mat, and after it had been packed with wet moss by Stephen in a most skilful way, for he was a perfect artist at this kind of work, the mat was bound round the roots in such a fashion that none of the contents could escape. Also each flower scape was lashed to a thin bamboo so as to prevent it from breaking on the journey. Then the whole bundle was lifted on to a kind of bamboo stretcher that we made and <b>firmly</b> <b>secured</b> <b>to</b> it with palm-fibre ropes.|$|E
6000|$|But, {{for all the}} {{apparent}} security of this nest, so deep, so warm, so <b>firmly</b> <b>secured</b> <b>to</b> the twigs and branches, the little orioles are not entirely safe. Their mother may protect them from rain and cold; from winged enemies and creeping serpents, but she cannot defend them against the attacks of boys and men. An oriole's nest is such a curious structure, and the birds {{are known to be}} of such fine form and gorgeous plumage, that many boys cannot resist the temptation of climbing up after them and, if there are young ones within, of carrying the whole affair away in order to try and [...] "raise" [...] the young birds. Sometimes the nest is put in a cage, where the old bird can come and feed its young, and in other cases the captor undertakes to do the feeding himself. I have seen experiments of this kind tried, but never knew the slightest success to follow them, and the attempt, generally useless, is always cruel.|$|E

50|$|Wood floors, {{particularly}} older ones, {{will tend}} to 'squeak' in certain places. This {{is caused by the}} wood rubbing against other wood, usually at a joint of the subfloor. <b>Firmly</b> <b>securing</b> the pieces <b>to</b> each other with screws or nails may reduce this problem.|$|R
50|$|The cytotrophoblastic {{shell is}} the {{external}} layer of cytotrophoblasts from the fetus that is {{found on the}} maternal surface of the placenta. The cytotrophoblastic shell <b>firmly</b> <b>secures</b> the placenta <b>to</b> the mother's endometrium called the decidua basalis. Gaps in the cytotrophoblastic shell allow endometrial arteries and veins to reach the intervillous space.|$|R
60|$|While the {{children}} were looking at these scenes with wonder and admiration, as the ship passed down the harbor, a young-looking man, who appeared {{to belong to the}} ship, came to them and told them that, if they wished to remain on deck, they had better go and sit upon the settees. So saying, he pointed to several large and heavy-looking settees, which were placed near the middle of the deck, around {{what seemed to be a}} sort of skylight. These settees were all <b>firmly</b> <b>secured</b> <b>to</b> their places with strong cords, by means of which they were tied by the legs to some of the fixtures of the skylights. In obedience to this suggestion, {{the children}} went and took their places upon a settee. Jane carried the cage, containing Tiger, which she had kept carefully with her thus far, and put it down upon the settee by her side. The man who had directed the children to this place, and who was a sort of mate, as they call such officers at sea, looked at the kitten with an expression of contempt upon his countenance, but said nothing. He took the camp stools which the children had left, and carried them away.|$|E
60|$|The try-works {{are planted}} between the {{foremast}} and mainmast, the most roomy {{part of the}} deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength, fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is <b>firmly</b> <b>secured</b> <b>to</b> the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides, and screwing {{it down to the}} timbers. On the flanks it is cased with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened hatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in number, and each of several barrels' capacity. When not in use, they are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver punchbowls. During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing them--one man in each pot, side by side-- many confidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from any point in precisely the same time.|$|E
50|$|Under {{cover of}} {{the early hours of}} one Friday morning, a group of volunteers pushed the FJ Holden under the bridge next to the water on the Southern bank of the Torrens. The car was lifted using beams and lifting gear {{attached}} to a small hand operated crane located on the footbridge. The crane, with car attached was then pushed out to the centre of the bridge. The car was then <b>firmly</b> <b>secured</b> <b>to</b> the bridge using a large chain. The crane and volunteers then quickly disappeared into the night and were never found.|$|E
50|$|He {{developed}} a unique grip for his foil. He {{would replace the}} regular foil handle and pommel with a saber handle and pommel, which would be considerably shorter, and use adhesive tape <b>to</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>secure</b> the foil <b>to</b> his wrist. This handle system {{was known as the}} “Levis Grip”. Levis attributed his success to the shorter, faster, stronger hand movements that the lighter Levis Grip would provide.|$|R

50|$|Five Maneuvers were {{conducted}} to refine the orbit of Progress M-15M before rendezvous operations started early on 22 April. Progress M-15M docked with the ISS on April 22 at 14:39 GMT to the Pirs Docking Compartment Nadir Port. The port was vacated on 19 April by Progress M-14M. Fully automated rendezvous and docking operations using the Kurs docking system aboard the ISS and the Progress, drove the spacecraft to the linkup at orbital sunset. During the docking the ISS and Progress M-15M were orbiting 249 miles above northern China. Hooks and latches were engaged {{a few minutes after}} docking <b>to</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>secure</b> the spacecraft <b>to</b> the ISS.|$|R
50|$|Lighting {{fixtures}} {{and other devices}} installed in a dropped ceiling are required to be <b>firmly</b> <b>secured</b> <b>to</b> the dropped ceiling framework. In {{the event of a}} fire above a dropped ceiling it is often necessary for firemen to have to pull down the ceiling in a hurry to quickly gain access to the conflagration. Loose fixtures merely resting in the framework by force of gravity can become unseated and swing down on their armorflex power cables to hit the firemen below. Binding the fixtures to the framework assures that if the framework must be pulled down the fixture will come down with it and not become a pendulous swinging hazard to the firemen.|$|E
50|$|Kanazawa had {{a further}} {{expansion}} in 1661, when many samurai who had followed their retired Lord Toshitsune to his villa at Komatsu returned after his death. They built {{houses on the}} fringes of the city, with street layouts almost totally unplanned. These areas {{are some of the most}} labyrinthine parts of the city, but this was not done for defensive purposes at all: by this time peace was quite <b>firmly</b> <b>secured.</b> <b>To</b> alleviate crowding from the continual (illegal) inflow of peasants and other migrants, residents were permitted to rent land from neighbouring farmers, and these areas are some of the most convoluted of all, as the roads were laid out on the old winding paths through the fields.|$|E
50|$|The {{operating}} table system {{has a number}} of advantages. Transportation is easier since this unit is generally <b>firmly</b> <b>secured</b> <b>to</b> the floor and thus the foot and column of the unit no longer need to be transported. In addition, the transporter has light and large casters which are gentle not just to the floor. The entire operating area is more hygienic since the casters are not attached to the system, like on a mobile {{operating table}}. These are hard to clean and more unhygienic as a result. The operating table column can be rotated by 360° and offers ideal space for the feet of the team. The table top is, thanks to the use of x-ray-capable materials, almost completely radiolucent. The universal operating table is available as both stationary, mobile and moveable units. A mobile operating table is, however, used as a special table. The table top cannot be removed or replaced. Operation may, according to version, be manual, pedal or motorised.|$|E

5000|$|For Heinrich Schenker, [...] "all {{foreground}} is diminution".

This conception has been essential to Schenker's theory {{from some of}} his earliest writings. In Schenkerian analysis a diminution is an elaboration by which an event formed of notes of longer value is expressed in notes of smaller value. See nonchord tone.|$|R
40|$|A railway sleeper is the {{structural}} element which transversally connects the two rails {{by means of}} fastening components, thus ensuring its gauge. Its additional function is <b>to</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>secure</b> the track <b>to</b> the ballast and to distribute the loads transferred from railway carriages to the ballast. One {{of the most important}} parameters in the characterisation of performances given by railway sleepers is represented by their lateral resistance to the sliding: the higher its value increases, the better the track stability becomes, thus reducing the frequency of maintenance interventions necessary to keep the superstructure efficient. This article focuses on the performance profile of an innovative railway sleeper, patented in Italy and called ‘EGA’ (High Performance mono-Block sleeper), under different efficiency conditions of the ballast. The research is carried out through a comparative assessment of traditional mono and bi-block sleepers, evaluating the resistance of the single sleeper thought as independent of the other constituents of the track...|$|R

40|$|Tears of the patellar and {{quadriceps}} tendon {{are common}} in the active population, especially in athletes. At present, several techniques for surgical repair and reconstruction are available. When reruptures occur, a reconstruction is mandatory. In the present paper, we describe a surgical technique for patellar and quadriceps tendon reconstruction using ipsilateral hamstring autograft. After routine hamstring tendon harvesting, the tendon ends are prepared using a whip stitch. A transverse tunnel is drilled in the midportion of the patella, the hamstring graft is passed through the patella, and <b>firmly</b> <b>secured</b> <b>to</b> the patellar tunnel openings with sutures. The details of the technique are fully described. Autologous ipsilateral hamstring tendon grafts provide a secure sound means to manage these challenging injuries...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{guidelines}} is to provide effective safeguards. They cover the selection of safeguarding methods.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the osteoconductive nature of Bio-OssRTM (natural deproteinized bone mineral) when used as an onlay bone substitute in a Guided Bone Regeneration model. The lateral surface of the mandible was exposed bilaterally, in 8 rabbits. On {{one side of the}} mandible, two titanium chambers were filled with Bio-OssRTM material and the chambers were then <b>firmly</b> <b>secured</b> <b>to</b> the mandible using screws. The pores in the titanium chambers were covered with a layer of Bio-GideRTM material. On {{the opposite side of the}} mandible, chambers without Bio-OssRTM were placed on the lateral side of the mandible as a control. After a healing period of 3 months, histologic sections were obtained from each chamber. It was observed that new bone was generated in both test and control chambers to various degrees. In the test group, the newly generated bone was 18. 41 % and in the control group it was 5. 31 %. This difference was statistically significant. Thus, in this experiment, Bio-OssRTM was proven to be osteoconductive...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} a reinforcement intervention {{conceived by}} one of the authors (C. Bertolini) and performed on the historical timber roof structure of the Valentino Castle in Torino (Italy) some thirty years ago. The timber roof of the towers, dating back to 17 th century, is a three-dimensional frame structure with a height of about 12 m. In the transversal direction four main great trusses are present, and two small trusses are placed close to the transversal masonry walls. The pitch is strongly inclined. A ridge connects the structure in the longitudinal direction of the timber roof, in addition to five series of purlins and three orders of overlaid frames with stiffening functions. This structural complex is <b>firmly</b> <b>secured</b> <b>to</b> the covering planks that support the tiles of black stone. The intervention was carried out with timber elements anchored to the ancient masonry walls, in order to improve their seismic behaviour. This intervention proved to be particularly innovative, since at that time the regional area where the castle is located was not yet considered a seismic area by the national standards. Laser scanning surveying, non-destructive investigations and numerical simulations are adopted in the present study, in order to assess the efficiency of the intervention and the present condition of the joints...|$|E
40|$|Background: Repair of incisional hernia (IH) in {{the elderly}} is a {{challenge}} for the surgeon. Primary closure is preferable but is not always possible because of high recurrence rates of IH repaired without a prosthesis and/or possible respiratory and cardiovascular complications due to extreme tension of the margins. We report our experience with underlay mesh placement in elderly patients with large IH. Methods: A total of 72 patients from January 2003 to December 2009 underwent IH repair involving placement of an intraperitoneal Gore® DualMesh® prosthesis. The prosthesis was first anchored at eight points in a compass rose pattern using a Gore® suture passer and then <b>firmly</b> <b>secured</b> <b>to</b> the abdominal wall with a 360 ° internal crown running suture. Results: Two intraoperative intestinal tears occurred during debridement and were immediately sutured. Postoperative complications included seven seromas, four hematomas, and two infections, {{one of which was}} resolved with conservative treatment while one required prosthesis removal. Conclusion: This surgical procedure, like laparoscopic treatment, allows the surgeon to avoid dissection of the abdominal layer and improves prosthesis adhesion with reinforcement of the incisional area near the abdominal defect. The reduction in operation time is remarkable. Despite good results in terms of safety and minimal recurrence for laparoscopy in the management of IH, the use of minimally invasive techniques for large incisional wall defects, especially in elderly patients, is still controversial and practiced by few surgeons. This open technique avoids cardiopulmonary complications arising from pneumoperitoneum {{in the elderly}}...|$|E
