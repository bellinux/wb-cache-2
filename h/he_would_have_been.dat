5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> with Claudius {{and his family}} {{for the majority of}} the time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E
5|$|By Edwin's debt of {{allegiance}} to him, Rædwald {{became the first}} foreign king to hold direct influence in Northumbria. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> instrumental in Edwin's secure establishment as king of both Deira and Bernicia.|$|E
5|$|An inquest in April 2008 {{found that}} Jones had sped over a {{pedestrian}} crossing {{on the wrong}} side of the road, leading to a head-on collision. His death was recorded as an accident, but it was confirmed that had he survived, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> facing two charges of death by dangerous driving.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{compared}} Kilmer to British Catholic writers Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton—suggesting {{that his}} reputation might {{have risen to}} the level where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> considered their American counterpart if not for his untimely death.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} King family, members {{disagree}} about his {{religious and political}} views about gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. King's widow Coretta said publicly that she believed her husband would have supported gay rights. However, his youngest child, Bernice King, has said publicly that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> opposed to gay marriage.|$|E
5|$|Franco's plane {{landed in}} Gran Canaria on July 14, but, based in Tenerife, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{unable to make}} the plane without the death of General Amado Balmes, {{military}} commander in Gran Canaria, {{who was killed in}} a shooting accident on July 16. Whether his death was an accident, suicide, or murder is unknown.|$|E

5|$|However, during Act V, {{there is}} no mention of Egeus, nor does he have a {{speaking}} role. It is logical, however, that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in attendance since it is also his daughter Hermia's wedding that the group if there to celebrate.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, in 1518, the Kremers {{moved back}} to Rupelmonde, {{possibly}} motivated by the deteriorating conditions in Gangelt—famine, plague and lawlessness. Mercator would have attended the local school in Rupelmonde {{from the age of}} seven, when he arrived from Gangelt, and there <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> taught the basics of reading, writing, arithmetic and Latin.|$|E
5|$|Although Bosch's career flourished {{during the}} High Renaissance, {{he lived in}} an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{familiar}} with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.|$|E
60|$|That was {{the last}} Sergeant Flannagan had seen either of Billy Byrne or his companion. The trail had ceased at the open window of the washroom {{at the rear of}} the restaurant, and search as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unable to pick it up again.|$|R
60|$|Edward hesitated. His natural truthfulness obliged him {{to admit}} a {{knowledge}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> gladly <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to deny.|$|R
50|$|Parfit {{then moved}} to discuss the {{identity}} of future generations. He first posited that one's existence is intimately related to the time and conditions of conception. I would not be me if my parents waited two more years to have a child. While they <b>would</b> still <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a child, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> certainly <b>have</b> <b>been</b> someone else; even if he <b>had</b> still <b>been</b> their first-born son, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> me.|$|R
5|$|Although St. Gatien {{was entered}} in the Cambridgeshire Handicap at the next Newmarket meeting, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{required}} to carry 139 pounds, and his connections decided not to run, instead targeting the ten furlong Free Handicap at the same meeting on October 22. He started odds-on favourite and successfully conceded three pounds to Duke of Richmond, winning comfortably by {{three quarters of a}} length. On his final start of the year he won at Newmarket for the third time when taking the Jockey Club Cup.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, Headley's {{average in}} Test matches of 60.83 is third highest {{among those with}} 2,000 runs, behind Bradman and Graeme Pollock, and but for the Tests he played after the war, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> above Pollock. In all {{first-class}} matches, he has the third highest average with 69.86, behind Bradman and Vijay Merchant among those who played 50 innings. He averaged a century every fourth innings in which he batted, second again to Bradman, and did not suffer a poor series in his career before the war.|$|E
5|$|He {{was part}} of the England squad that reached fourth place in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, where he famously cried after {{receiving}} a yellow card in the semi-final with West Germany, which meant <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> suspended for the final itself had England won the game. He also helped the team to the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 1996, scoring a goal against Scotland which was described {{as one of the best}} of the tournament.|$|E
60|$|Away {{from her}} {{far-reaching}} influence, her vigilant contrivance and conquering resources, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> long courted or extolled.|$|R
60|$|Sam {{could not}} choose but {{go with the}} man. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>have</b> <b>been</b> alone, but could not shake him off.|$|R
60|$|His own {{strength}} was whole in him, {{he saw nothing}} of the treachery of his own heart; for <b>had</b> <b>he,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so free to make promises to God of amendment. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>have</b> <b>been</b> afraid, {{that if he had}} mended, he should have turned with the dog to his vomit, and have begged prayers of Saints, and assistance from heaven upon that account, that he might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> kept from doing so.|$|R
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Liverpool Football Club, he stated that if he wasn't a footballer <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a physio. On 12 September 2010, he was jailed for four months over a drunken attack on a taxi driver which had taken place on 9 August 2009 in Watford, Hertfordshire. He was tried for racially aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm but a jury acquitted him of that charge, but found him guilty of an alternative charge of assaulting the taxi driver.|$|E
5|$|In early summer, Jordan Cameron, {{a former}} {{freshman}} basketball player from Brigham Young University, also transferred to USC {{to play football}} as a wide receiver. However, when USC refused to accept some of Cameron's credits from Brigham Young, {{he was forced to}} withdraw and attend Ventura College. He missed the football season but was given the option to try to rejoin the team in 2008. Even if he had stayed at USC, due to NCAA transfer rules <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> ineligible to play in 2007. Cameron ended up enrolling at USC a year later.|$|E
5|$|Some {{accounts}} of Nostradamus's life state {{that he was}} afraid of being persecuted for heresy by the Inquisition, but neither prophecy nor astrology fell in this bracket, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in danger only if he had practised magic to support them. In 1538 he came into conflict with the Church in Agen after an Inquisitor visited the area looking for Anti-Catholic views. His brief imprisonment at Marignane in late 1561 was solely because he had violated a recent royal decree by publishing his 1562 almanac without the prior permission of a bishop.|$|E
60|$|The answer {{somewhat}} chilled Bateman. It {{seemed to}} him a little cynical. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sorry to act a noble part.|$|R
60|$|Bull {{strongly}} {{approved of}} the suggestion, and Terence, though in some respects <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>have</b> <b>been</b> alone, at last agreed to it.|$|R
60|$|Had I {{slapped the}} {{merchant}} {{in the face}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more surprised. He sprang {{to his feet and}} glared at me.|$|R
5|$|The 44th Bombardment Group {{took part}} in an even more costly raid, {{the attack on the}} Romanian Ploesti oil fields, on 1 August 1943. When Johnson arrived at the target leading his group, he found that the 93d Bombardment Group had already {{attacked}} their target by mistake, and as a consequence, the defenders were alert. Although <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> justified in turning back, Johnson led his group in through thick smoke, flak and explosions that concealed the tall smokestacks and barrage balloon cables. On the way home, they had to fight off Me109 fighters.|$|E
5|$|The NHL {{expanded}} in 1967, doubling from 6 teams to 12. Among the new entries was the Minnesota North Stars. The new team's coach and general manager, Wren Blair, had scouted Masterton while {{he played with}} the US Nationals and purchased his NHL playing rights from the Canadiens. Masterton was {{the first player to}} sign with Minnesota, agreeing to a two-year contract. He said {{prior to the start of}} the 1967–68 season that being able to play in Minnesota was key as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> unlikely to consider an offer with any other team.|$|E
5|$|These benefices {{provided}} an income without {{the obligation to}} perform any pastoral services. Their revenues were assigned {{to pay for his}} studies, leaving poorly paid vicars to carry out the pastoral work. Walter remained as a teacher and official at Orléans, perhaps without returning to Scotland at all, until the late 1350s, by when <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> absent from his native country for more than 25years. In an Aberdeen document dated 12 July 1356, it was noted that he was still absent from his post.|$|E
60|$|Had Richard {{been struck}} in the face <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more taken aback than he was by this short and cold speech.|$|R
