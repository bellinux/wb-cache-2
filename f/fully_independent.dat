5|$|Darkwatch {{was officially}} {{unveiled}} on January 12, 2004, its announcement {{accompanied by a}} showing of its playable multiplayer deathmatch mode, and was originally slated for a Q4 2004 release. At one point, the game remained in limbo for several months until May 2005, when High Moon Studios, by then a <b>fully</b> <b>independent</b> development company, found a publisher in Capcom.|$|E
5|$|In September 1962, {{the people}} of Singapore voted to join the Federation of Malaysia. The process was {{completed}} on 16 September 1963, when the Malaysian flag was hoisted on Singapore by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. The Singapore flag was reconfirmed as the national flag when Singapore became <b>fully</b> <b>independent</b> from Malaysia on 9 August 1965.|$|E
5|$|The accused had {{no right}} of appeal. The right was given to their {{relatives}} or other interested persons {{but they were not}} allowed to nominate psychiatrists {{to take part in the}} evaluation, because all psychiatrists were considered <b>fully</b> <b>independent</b> and equally credible before the law.|$|E

5|$|An early {{triumph for}} the Bristol Old Vic {{occurred}} when the 1954 première production of Salad Days transferred to the West End and became the longest-running musical on the London stage at that time. The Arts Council remained involved until 1963 when their role {{was taken over by}} the City Council. In the same year the London Old Vic was disbanded and the Bristol company became <b>fully</b> <b>independent.</b> The Bristol Old Vic also put plays on in the council-owned Little Theatre from then until 1980.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of 'joint' warfare {{was made clear}} to the Australian military during World War II when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands. Following the war, several senior officers lobbied for {{the appointment of a}} {{commander in chief of the}} three services. The government rejected this proposal and the three services remained <b>fully</b> <b>independent.</b> The absence of a central authority resulted in poor co-ordination between the services, with each service organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from this}} {{immediate}} effect, the case represented a clear {{recognition that the}} Australia Act 1986 finally and completely ended all legal ties between the United Kingdom and Australia, and that Australia has been a <b>fully</b> <b>independent</b> and sovereign nation {{in its own right}} since at least 3 March 1986, when the Act came into force. Some commentators have criticised the evolutionary approach adopted by the court, and the court's resultant failure to find a certain date on which Australia became independent, arguing that the distinction is more than merely symbolic and could have real consequences. However, even Justice Callinan, who questioned the evolutionary approach in this case, affirmed in a later case (Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet) that the effect of the Australia Act in finally recognising independence could not be doubted.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, it was a non-fee paying voluntary-aided school, but {{following}} {{local council}} plans to remove this status and merge the Grammar School with a nearby secondary modern school, the governors took the decision to become <b>fully</b> <b>independent</b> in 1983. Now a fee-paying day school, 650 pupils aged 4 to 18 attend from the three counties of Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire. Following {{the closure of the}} nearby St Audrey's Convent, a significant feeder for the senior school, a new junior and infant preparatory school was opened in 1997, now known as Magdalene House.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{had been}} de facto divided, and two {{independent}} states, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic were created within {{the borders of}} Allied and Soviet occupation zones, accordingly. The rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence. Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a <b>fully</b> <b>independent</b> policy, causing tension with the USSR.|$|E
5|$|Kruger was {{appointed}} Vice-President in March 1877, {{shortly before the}} South African Republic was annexed by Britain as the Transvaal. Over {{the next three years}} he headed two deputations to London to try to have this overturned and became the leading figure in the movement to restore the South African Republic's independence, culminating in the Boers' victory in the First Boer War of 1880–81. Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive triumvirate, then was elected President. In 1884 he headed a third deputation that brokered the London Convention, under which Britain recognised the South African Republic as a <b>fully</b> <b>independent</b> state.|$|E

5|$|Nasser made Egypt <b>fully</b> <b>independent</b> of British influence, and {{the country}} became a major power in the {{developing}} world under his leadership. One of Nasser's main domestic efforts was to establish social justice, which he deemed a prerequisite to liberal democracy. During his presidency, ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, jobs, health services and nourishment, as well as other forms of social welfare, while feudalistic influence waned. By the end of his presidency, employment and working conditions improved considerably, although poverty was still high in the country and substantial resources allocated for social welfare had been diverted to the war effort.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese troops {{began to}} suffer losses in November, {{fighting}} in the northern region of Xilama. With increasing support from the populace, and the low number of Portuguese regular troops, FRELIMO was quickly able to advance south towards Meponda and Mandimba, linking to Tete {{with the aid of}} forces from the neighbouring Republic of Malawi, which had become a <b>fully</b> <b>independent</b> member of the Commonwealth of Nations on July 6, 1964. Despite the increasing range of FRELIMO operations, attacks were still limited to small strike teams attacking lightly defended administrative outposts, with the FRELIMO lines of communication and supply utilising canoes along the Ruvuma River and Lake Malawi.|$|E
5|$|The affair came {{amid the}} larger dispute between Whitehall and Salisbury {{regarding}} the terms under which Rhodesia could be granted sovereign independence. Rhodesia's mostly white government insisted that statehood should {{come under the}} constitution introduced with Britain's approval in 1961, while Whitehall insisted that a set timetable for the introduction of black majority rule {{would have to be}} in place before the country could be <b>fully</b> <b>independent.</b> The Rhodesian government's stance on this matter caused it to become isolated within the Commonwealth, which from 1964 excluded it from most of its internal bodies, while the Rhodesian military became unofficially embargoed by its established British and American suppliers.|$|E

5|$|The need {{to include}} the various {{elements}} of the British Empire in coronations was not considered until 1902, when it was attended by the prime ministers and governors-general of the British Dominions, by then almost completely autonomous, and also {{by many of the}} rulers of the Indian Princely States and the various British Protectorates. An Imperial Conference was held afterwards. In 1911, the procession inside Westminster Abbey included the banners of the dominions and the Indian Empire along with the traditional banners of the Home Nations. By 1937, the Statute of Westminster 1931 had made the dominions <b>fully</b> <b>independent,</b> and the wording of the coronation oath was amended to include their names and confine the elements concerning religion to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{ownership}} {{group of}} the club is composed of four investors. The majority owner is the former owner of the now defunct USL-1 team Seattle Sounders Adrian Hanauer, with minority owners Joe Roth, a Hollywood producer; Paul Allen, Microsoft co-founder {{and owner of the}} Seattle Seahawks and Portland Trail Blazers; and Drew Carey, comedian and game show host. Allen's partnership allowed for the team to share certain resources with the Seahawks, including over half of the team's full-time staff, with merged ticket, marketing, and financial operations. This arrangement ended on April 30, 2014, with the Sounders becoming a <b>fully</b> <b>independent</b> business operation.|$|E
5|$|Field's {{government}} {{was startled by}} Britain's announcement in October 1963 that Nyasaland would become <b>fully</b> <b>independent</b> on 6 July 1964. While no date was set for Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised {{that it was going}} to follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were so inclined, go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the Labour Party might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to the polls, and preferably not after Nyasaland. The Federation dissolved as scheduled at the end of 1963.|$|E

5|$|On January 9, 1925, Vermont Senator Frank Greene {{introduced}} legislation for commemorative coins {{to mark the}} 150th anniversary of Vermont declaring itself <b>fully</b> <b>independent</b> in 1777 and of the American victory at the Battle of Bennington the same year. His bill passed the Senate without difficulty, but in the House of Representatives faced an array of problems. Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon sent a letter opposing the bill and dispatched three Treasury officials to testify against it, arguing that the public was being confused as special coin issues entered circulation. The committee's resolve to have no more commemorative coins—after this one—did not impress the full House, which added two more half dollars to the legislation to mark other anniversaries. The Senate agreed to the changes, and President Calvin Coolidge signed the authorizing act on February 24, 1925.|$|E
5|$|The British High Commissioner's role became {{that of an}} {{ambassador}} following Singapore's independence from Britain and merger with Malaysia in 1963. Apart from that {{the executive branch of}} the Singapore Government remained largely unchanged, although now it governed a state within a larger federation. However, with effect from 9 August 1965, Singapore left the Federation of Malaysia and became a <b>fully</b> <b>independent</b> republic. On separation from Malaysia, the Singapore Government retained its executive authority, and the executive authority of the Parliament of Malaysia ceased to extend to Singapore and vested in the Singapore Government. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Supreme Head of State of Malaysia, also ceased to be the Supreme Head of Singapore and relinquished his sovereignty, jurisdiction, power and authority, executive or otherwise in respect of Singapore, which revested in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara of Singapore. The Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965 then vested the executive authority of Singapore in the newly created post of President, and made it exercisable by him or by the Cabinet or by any Minister authorized by the Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The First and Second World Wars curtailed some {{university}} {{activities as}} {{undergraduate and graduate}} men eagerly enlisted. Intercollegiate athletic competitions and the Hart House Debates were suspended, although exhibition and interfaculty games were still held. The David Dunlap Observatory in Richmond Hill opened in 1935, followed by the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies in 1949. The university opened satellite campuses in Scarborough in 1964 and in Mississauga in 1967. The university's former affiliated schools at the Ontario Agricultural College and Glendon Hall became <b>fully</b> <b>independent</b> of the University of Toronto and became part of University of Guelph in 1964 and York University in 1965, respectively. Beginning in the 1980s, reductions in government funding prompted more rigorous fundraising efforts. The University of Toronto was the first Canadian university to amass a financial endowment greater than C$1 billion in 2007.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relation}} between semi and <b>fully</b> device <b>independent</b> protocols. As a tool, we use the correspondence between Bell inequalities and dimension witnesses. We present a method for converting the former into the latter and vice versa. This relation provides us with interesting results for both scenarios. First, we find new random number generation protocols with higher bit rates for both the semi and <b>fully</b> device <b>independent</b> cases. As a byproduct, we obtain whole new classes of Bell inequalities and dimension witnesses. Then, we show how optimization methods used in studies on Bell inequalities can be adopted for dimension witnesses. Comment: published versio...|$|R
