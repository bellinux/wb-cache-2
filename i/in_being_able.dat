5|$|Great {{confidence}} was placed <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> {{to reduce the}} noise of a turbojet and massive strides by SNECMA in silencer design were reported during the programme. However, by 1974 the spade silencers which projected into the exhaust were reported to be ineffective. The Olympus Mk.622 with reduced jet velocity was proposed to reduce the noise {{but it was not}} developed.|$|E
5|$|Michael makes several {{attempts}} {{to recapture the}} limelight, culminating with an overlong toast at the wedding banquet in which he impugns Phyllis' chastity. Outraged, Phyllis' husband Bob Vance (Bobby Ray Shafer) throws {{him out of the}} reception hall. Dwight does not let him re-enter, taking satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to eject a real wedding crasher. Michael finds company with Uncle Al, and eventually confesses that he is sorry for his behavior and worried that it may have sullied Phyllis' day.|$|E

50|$|Because {{estimates}} {{suggest that}} as much as one third of the Manx population only spoke Manx at this time, with an additional third speaking it significantly better than English, this might be behind the bookâ€™s great success and long-standing influence. Reports exist of an illiterate female weaver in Dalby <b>in</b> the 1850s <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to recite the poem in its entirety, and a preacher <b>in</b> Laxey <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to recite on demand any passage of the poem.|$|R

5|$|To the {{practical}} ornithologist there arises a considerable gratification <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> {{to ascertain the}} distinguishing characters of birds as they appear at a distance, whether at rest, or during their flight; for not only every genus has something peculiar to itself, but each species has its own appropriate marks, by which a judicious observer may discriminate almost with certainty.|$|E
5|$|Human {{language}} is also unique <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> {{to refer to}} abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events {{that took place in}} the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human {{language is}} also considered unique.|$|E
5|$|Michael takes relish <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> {{to freely}} {{proclaim}} {{his relationship with}} Jan to his bosses, making Jan uncomfortable. She eventually pulls him aside and tries {{to get him to}} have sex with her in the bathroom. Michael refuses and she becomes angry. As they drive home together, Jan hypothesizes that she only enjoyed being with Michael because their relationship was undisclosed and therefore unethical, and that disclosing it was a mistake. Michael is hurt and upset at this, and Jan takes back her comments to keep him from crying.|$|E

5|$|Weak {{attacks from}} uke {{allow for a}} {{conditioned}} response from tori, and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners. To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, {{in keeping with the}} core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to protect themselves and their training partners. Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format. Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that {{there is no need to}} adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.|$|E

25|$|In May 2010, ReelzChannel {{reported}} that {{production of the}} film would be delayed until February 2011. The report cited Singer's interest <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to pre-visualize scenes with the digital giants in-camera with the live-action actors (a la James Cameron's Avatar) {{and the need for}} more time to work out the complex process as reasons for the delay.|$|E

After the jutsu broke (thanks to Rurijo) she confesses to Hayate, but is rejected since {{he fell in love with}} Rurijo.|$|E
25|$|Transformative {{products}} are exciting, but robo-pets {{are even more}} exciting. We were interested in making the technology very visible, but also playing with translucency and transparency, soft boundaries. The irony of the digital age is that, as technology gets more invisible, people are more interested <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to see it again, as in Apple Computer's iMac, with its translucent blues and milky plastics that simultaneously tease and reveal.|$|E
25|$|As a {{nurse in}} a {{hospital}} ward, Lavinia speaks to wounded soldiers and prisoners of war in Washington, specifically asking about her brother, Isaac, who was imprisoned for assaulting a fellow government official. She had hoped that they had seen or heard from him {{while they were in}} the prison camps. The Washington officials ignore her plea to free Isaac. Lavinia is only able to speak to the president on Isaac's behalf because of the intervention of a man, Dr. Norval's friend, Mr. Sinclair. Lavinia then realizes that her belief <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to voice her opinions equally with men is unrealistic.|$|E

25|$|Federation Commander: Orion Attack {{returned}} to near the standard product format with 15 ships and a monster {{as well as}} counters for ships which appeared in several earlier products like the Briefing #1 and Booster Zero but contains no new map features. The pack concentrated on the operations and opponents of the Orion Pirates, a faction which have been seen since the original Klingon Border. Orion ships are unique in possessing a stealth coating making them harder to hit and <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to be customised with weapons belonging to any other race (with a few exceptions).|$|E
25|$|The Camel {{proved to}} have better {{manoeuvrability}} than the Albatros D.III and D.V and offered heavier armament and better performance than the Pup and Triplane. Its controls were light and sensitive. The Camel turned more slowly to the left, {{which resulted in a}} nose-up attitude due to the torque of the rotary engine, but the torque also resulted <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to turn to the right quicker than other fighters, although that resulted in a tendency towards a nose-down attitude from the turn. Because of the faster turning capability to the right, some pilots preferred to change heading 90Â° to the left by turning 270Â° to the right.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many {{instances}} showing {{that there is a}} form of aphasia among deaf individuals. Sign language is, after all, a form of communication that has been shown to use the same areas of the brain as verbal forms of communication. Mirror neurons become activated when an animal is acting in a particular way or watching another individual act in the same manner. These mirror neurons are important in giving an individual the ability to mimic movements of hands. Broca's area of speech production has been shown to contain several of these mirror neurons resulting in significant similarities of brain activity between sign language and vocal speech communication. Facial communication is a significant portion of how animals interact with each other. Humans use facial movements to create, what other humans perceive, to be faces of emotions. While combining these facial movements with speech, a more full form of language is created which enables the species to interact with a much more complex and detailed form of communication. Sign language also uses these facial movements and emotions along with the primary hand movement way of communicating. These facial movement forms of communication come from the same areas of the brain. When dealing with damages to certain areas of the brain, vocal forms of communication are in jeopardy of severe forms of aphasia. Since these same areas of the brain are being used for sign language, these same, at least very similar, forms of aphasia can show in the Deaf community. Individuals can show a form of Wernicke's aphasia with sign language and they show deficits in their abilities <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to produce any form of expressions. Broca's aphasia shows up in some patients, as well. These individuals find tremendous difficulty <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to actually sign the linguistic concepts they are trying to express.|$|E
