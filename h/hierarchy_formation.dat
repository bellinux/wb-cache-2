40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} are to {{investigate}} the evolutionary processes {{that lead to the}} <b>hierarchy's</b> <b>formation</b> and examine the role of natural selection in it. The approach used was critical analysis of key references to identify important processes in the <b>formation</b> of the <b>hierarchy</b> and then examine the role selection plays. First, the structural organisation of the ecological system was examined, and then processes that created the structure were identified. Third, the causal relationship between non-equilibrium thermodynamics and key processes was articulated. Fourth, the important processes were then incorporated into a general model to explain how they generate and maintain the ecological hierarchy. Finally, the model provided the conceptual framework in which to examine selection's role {{in the formation of the}} nested ecological hierarchy. The arguments in this paper showed that two key processes in the <b>formation</b> of the <b>hierarchy</b> are self-organisation and integration. Self-organisation creates the structure, whereas integration stabilises it. The iterative process adds levels and complexity to the nested hierarchical structure. The analysis showed that natural selection affects the structure within levels as well as at the level immediately above the target of selection.

The aim of this thesis is to create parallel Czech-Russian military terms and examine them in terms of their word formation, especially systematism, motivation and etymology. The thesis also includes a brief historical overview of the development of Czech and Russian military ranks. The following sources were used in this thesis; general and specialized lexicological literature on word formation, general and specialized dictionaries, publications and articles of the authors dealing with the issues of milatary terminology.

40|$|Seismology {{has several}} {{features}} that suggest it {{is a highly}} internationalized field: the subject matter is global, the tools used to analyse seismic waves are dependent upon information technologies, and governments are interested in funding cooperative research. We explore whether an emerging field like seismology has a more internationalised structure than the older, related field of geophysics. Using aggregated journal-journal citations, we first show that, within the citing environment, seismology emerged from within geophysics as its own field in the 1990 s. The bibliographic analysis, however, does not show that seismology is more internationalised than geophysics: in 2000, seismology had a lower percentage of all articles co-authored on an international basis. Nevertheless, social network analysis shows that the core group of cooperating countries within seismology is proportionately larger and more distributed than that within geophysics. While the latter exhibits an established network with a <b>hierarchy,</b> the <b>formation</b> of a field in terms of new partnership relations is ongoing in seismology...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} approach in accounting for hierarchical differentiation in biology {{and the social}} sciences considers a hierarchy as a static distribution of individuals possessing differing amounts of some valued commodity, assumes that the hierarchy is generated by micro-level processes involving individuals, and attempts to reverse engineer the processes that produced the hierarchy. However, sufficient experimental and analytical results are available to evaluate this {{standard approach}} in the case of animal dominance hierarchies (pecking orders). Our evaluation using evidence from <b>hierarchy</b> <b>formation</b> in small groups of both hens and cichlid fish reveals significant deficiencies in the three tenets of the standard approach in accounting for the organization of dominance hierarchies. In consequence, we suggest that a new approach is needed to explain the organization of pecking orders and, very possibly, by implication, for other kinds of social hierarchies. We develop an example of such an approach that considers dominance hierarchies to be dynamic networks, uses dynamic sequences of interaction (dynamic network motifs) to explain the organization of dominance hierarchies, and derives these dynamic sequences directly from observation of <b>hierarchy</b> <b>formation.</b> We test this dynamical explanation using computer simulation and find a good fit with actual dynamics of <b>hierarchy</b> <b>formation</b> in small groups of hens. We hypothesize that the same dynamic sequences are used in small groups of many other animal species forming pecking orders, and we discuss the data required to evaluate our hypothesis. Finally, we briefly consider how our dynamic approach may be generalized to other kinds of social hierarchies using the example of the distribution of empty gastropod (snail) shells occupied in populations of hermit crabs...|$|E

40|$|Within a {{population}} of social animals, conflict will arise between unacquainted animals over the division of a valuable resource that is in limited supply (Pusey and Packer, 1997; Moynihan, 1998). This conflict leads {{to the formation of}} a social dominance hierarchy that enables peaceful, if uneven, divisions of resources to occur whenever the resources are contested. Conflict can also occur between unacquainted animals when tangible resources are absent. This conflict, which has been seen to be a dispute over social dominance (or future access to resources) (Clutton-Brock and Parker, 1995), also leads to <b>hierarchy</b> <b>formation.</b> These patterns are followed in crayfish populations, in which agonistic interactions between unfamiliar pairs of crayfish lead to <b>hierarchy</b> <b>formation</b> both when tangible resources are in dispute and when they are not. For example, larger crayfish evict smaller conspecifics from burrows that are closer to food sources (Ranta and Linström, 1992), and groups of unacquainted crayfish fight and form dominance hierarchies when no resource other than space is contested (Bovbjerg, 1953; Lowe, 1956).

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{development}} of pattern formation {{from the viewpoint of}} symmetry, we applied a two-dimensional discrete Walsh analysis to a one-dimensional cellular automata model under two types of regular initial conditions. The amount of symmetropy of cellular automata (CA) models under regular and random initial conditions corresponds to three Wolfram’s classes of CAs, identified as Classes II, III, and IV. Regular initial conditions occur in two groups. One group that makes a broken, regular pattern formation has four types of symmetry, whereas the other group that makes a higher <b>hierarchy</b> pattern <b>formation</b> has only two types. Additionally, both final pattern formations show an increased amount of symmetropy as time passes. Moreover, the final pattern formations are affected by iterations of base rules of CA models of chaos dynamical systems. The growth design formations limit possibilities: the ratio of developing final pattern formations under a regular initial condition decreases in the order of Classes III, II, and IV. This might be related to the difference in degree in reference to surrounding conditions. These findings suggest that calculations of symmetries of the structures of one-dimensional cellular automata models are useful for revealing rules of pattern generation for animal bodies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Swarm {{robotics}} draws {{inspiration from}} decentralised, self-organising biological systems {{in general and}} from the collective behaviour of social insects in particular. In social insect colonies, many tasks are performed by higher-order group or team entities, whose task solving capacities transcend those of the individual participants. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of such higher-order entities. We report on an experimental study in which a team of physical robots performs a foraging task. The robots are “identical ” in hardware and control. They make little use of memory and take actions purely {{on the basis of}} local information. Our study advances {{the current state of the}} art in swarm robotics with respect to the number of real-world robots engaging in teamwork (up to 12 robots in the most challenging experiment). To the best of our knowledge, in this paper we present the first self-organised system of robots that displays a dynamical hierarchy of teamwork (with cooperation also occurring among higherorder entities). Our study shows that teamwork requires neither individual recognition nor differences between individuals. This result might also contribute to the ongoing debate on the role of these characteristics in the division of labour in social insects.
