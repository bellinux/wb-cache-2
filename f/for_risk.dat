5|$|Before the {{widespread}} application of technetium-99m in nuclear medicine, the radioactive isotope thallium-201, with a half-life of 73 hours, {{was the main}} substance for nuclear cardiography. The nuclide is still used for stress tests <b>for</b> <b>risk</b> stratification in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This isotope of thallium can be generated using a transportable generator {{which is similar to}} the technetium-99m generator. The generator contains lead-201 (half-life 9.33 hours) which decays by electron capture to the thallium-201. The lead-201 can be produced in a cyclotron by the bombardment of thallium with protons or deuterons by the (p,3n) and (d,4n) reactions.|$|E

40|$|One {{tenet of}} {{behavioral}} economics is the asymmetry in how decision makers evaluate risks involving gains versus risks involving losses. Correspondingly, {{an increasingly important}} question is what neuroanatomical and neurochemical correlates underpin valuation over gains and losses. By employing an imaging genetics strategy, this paper aims at identifying the specific neurotransmitter pathways underlying these decision making processes. We find enhanced striatal activation responding to increases in the magnitude of utility <b>for</b> <b>risks</b> over gains and to increases in the magnitude of disutility <b>for</b> <b>risks</b> over losses, while increased amygdala activation correlates only with the disutility <b>for</b> <b>risks</b> over losses. Stratifying brain activation by genotype, we find that a well-characterized polymorphism in the dopamine transporter (DAT 1) contributes to individual differences in striatal response <b>for</b> gain-oriented <b>risks,</b> whereas a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter (STin 2) partially accounts for individual differences in amygdala responses <b>for</b> loss-oriented <b>risks.</b> Together, our results suggest {{the role of the}} amygdala and corresponding serotonergic pathway in evaluating losses. This further corroborates the hypothesis of serotonin being linked to dopamine in an "opponent partnership". © 2011 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
5|$|Cancers can {{be induced}} in animals at many sites. At {{sufficiently}} high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, {{and this has}} long been a basis <b>for</b> <b>risk</b> assessment. Dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer {{does not seem to be}} linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not mutagenic or genotoxic, in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the cancer risk is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on indirect effects such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. Carcinogenicity is associated with tissue damage, and it is often viewed now as secondary to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|Fifty light {{infantry}} {{men were}} in pursuit of Mercer's men when a fresh brigade of 1,100 militiamen {{under the command of}} Cadwalader appeared. Mawhood gathered his men who were all over the battlefield and put them into battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle <b>for</b> <b>risk</b> of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move his men into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know even the most basic military maneuvers. When his men {{reached the top of the}} hill and saw Mercer's men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around and ran back down the hill.|$|E

25|$|In {{decision}} theory, and {{in particular}} in choice under uncertainty, an agent is described as making an optimal choice {{in the context of}} incomplete information. <b>For</b> <b>risk</b> neutral agents, the choice involves using the expected values of uncertain quantities, while <b>for</b> <b>risk</b> averse agents it involves maximizing the expected value of some objective function such as a von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function. One example of using expected value in reaching optimal decisions is the Gordon–Loeb model of information security investment. According to the model, one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be {{only a small fraction of}} the expected loss (i.e., the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyber/information security breach).|$|E
