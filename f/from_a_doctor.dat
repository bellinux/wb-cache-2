5|$|His neck {{continued}} to cause him pain, and Prince Philip commented on its crooked state as he gave Trautmann his winner's medal. Trautmann attended that evening's post-match banquet despite {{being unable to}} move his head, {{and went to bed}} expecting the injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to St George's Hospital, where he was told he merely had a crick in his neck which would go away. Three days later, he got a second opinion <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> at Manchester Royal Infirmary. An X-ray revealed he had dislocated five vertebrae, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} these suspicions, many African-American leaders {{supported}} efforts to supply birth control to the African-American community. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and leader of New York's Urban League, asked Sanger to open a clinic in Harlem.Engelman, p. 160. Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic, staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930. The clinic was guided by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. It was publicized in the African-American press and African-American churches, and received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In the early 1940s, the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA) initiated a program called the Negro Project, managed by its Division of Negro Service (DNS).Engelman, pp. 175–177. As with the Harlem clinic, the primary aim of the DNS and its programs was to improve maternal and infant health. Based on her work at the Harlem clinic, Sanger suggested to the DNS that African Americans {{were more likely to}} take advice <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> of their own race, but other leaders prevailed and insisted that whites be employed in the outreach efforts. The discriminatory actions and statements by the movement's leaders during the 1920s and 1930s have led to continuing allegations that the movement was racist.Allegations of racism can be found in Franks, Angela (2005), Margaret Sanger's Eugenic Legacy: The Control of Female Fertility, McFarland; and in Davis, Angela (1981), Women, Race, and Class.|$|E

40|$|Background Due {{to limited}} {{information}} on sugar drink counseling, characteristics {{of parents who}} reported ever receiving counseling <b>from</b> <b>a</b> child’s <b>doctor</b> to limit <b>a</b> child’s sugar drink intake were examined. Methods This cross-sectional analysis was conducted on a convenient sample of 1570 US parents (aged 18 years) using the 2009 HealthStyles Survey. The outcome measure was parents with children aged 18 years who reported being told by <b>a</b> child’s <b>doctor</b> to limit <b>a</b> child’s sugar drink intake.

25|$|Casting the Mertzes, as {{they were}} now called (the surname taken <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> that Lucy {{scriptwriter}} Madelyn Pugh knew {{as a child in}} Indianapolis), proved to be a challenge. Ball had initially wanted character actor James Gleason, with whom she appeared in Columbia Pictures film Miss Grant Takes Richmond (1949), to play Fred Mertz. However, Gleason wanted nearly $3,500 per episode to play the role, a price that was far too high to sustain.|$|E

25|$|Some memory {{issues are}} due to stress, anxiety, or depression. A {{traumatic}} life event, such as {{the death of a}} spouse, can lead to changes in lifestyle and can leave an elderly person feeling unsure of themselves, sad, and lonely. Dealing with such drastic life changes can therefore leave some people confused or forgetful. While in some cases these feelings may fade, it is important to take these emotional problems seriously. By emotionally supporting a struggling relative and seeking help <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> or counselor, the forgetfulness can be improved.|$|E
25|$|The {{foster parent}} {{licensing}} process is often {{similar to the}} process to become licensed to adopt. It requires preparation classes {{as well as an}} application process. The application varies but may include: a minimum age, verification that your income allows you to meet your expenses, a criminal record check at local, state and federal levels including finger printing and no prior record of child abuse or neglect; a reference <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> to ensure that all household members are free from diseases that a child could catch and in sufficient health to parent a child and; letters of reference from an employer and others who know them.|$|E
25|$|Some countries, {{including}} the Czech Republic, require that an alien {{who needs a}} visa on entry be {{in possession of a}} valid visa upon exit. To satisfy this formal requirement, exit visas sometimes need to be issued. Russia requires an exit visa if a visitor stays past the expiration date of their visa. They must then extend their visa or apply for an exit visa and are not allowed to leave the country until they show a valid visa or have a permissible excuse for overstaying their visa (e.g., a note <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> or a hospital explaining an illness, missed flight, lost or stolen visa). In some cases, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can issue a Return-Home certificate that is valid for ten days from the embassy of the visitor's native country, thus eliminating the need for an exit visa.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{lines that}} delineated an EMT from a Paramedic and a Paramedic <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> {{are becoming increasingly}} blurred. Skills that were once reserved for physicians are now routinely performed by paramedics, and skills once reserved for paramedics, such as defibrillation, are now routinely performed by Basic Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs). However, there is wide variation among states, and even among counties within states, of what type of care providers at different levels are allowed to provide. In addition to these variations, some states and counties allow for add-ons, such as defibrillation or IV therapy, which enable workers at a lower level to learn and use additional skills that would not normally be {{within the scope of}} practice of their qualification level (for example, an EMT is not generally permitted to start an IV, but after successfully completing an IV add-on course, he or she would then be able to do so.) Add-on skills are generally more common in rural areas where definitive care is further away geographically and immediate interventions by EMTs are beneficial for patient care.|$|E
25|$|Some {{drugs are}} {{approved}} by the FDA under subsection H, which has two subparts. The first sets forth ways to rush experimental drugs, such as aggressive HIV and cancer treatments, to market when speedy approval is deemed vital {{to the health of}} potential patients. The second part of subsection H applies to drugs that not only must meet restrictions for use due to safety requirements, but also are required to meet postmarketing surveillance to establish that the safety results shown in clinical trials are seconded by use in a much wider population. Mifepristone was approved under the second part of subsection H. The result is that women cannot pick the drug up at a pharmacy, but must now receive it directly <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor.</b> Due to the possibility of adverse reactions such as excessive bleeding, which may require a blood transfusion, and incomplete abortion, which may require surgical intervention, the drug is only considered safe if a physician who is capable of administering a blood transfusion or a surgical abortion is available to the patient in the event of such emergencies. The approval of mifepristone under subsection H included a black box warning.|$|E

5|$|House {{was created}} by David Shore, who {{got the idea for}} the misanthropic title {{character}} <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor's</b> visit.

Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are drug users, blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way and gave the character a damaged leg arising <b>from</b> <b>an</b> improper diagnosis.|$|R

500|$|Most of {{the scenes}} {{featuring}} Schnauz on plasterer's stilts were shot using stuntmen. In the scene where Scully meets Schnauz, a safety cable was attached to Vince to keep him upright on the stilts and was edited out in post-production. Ken Hawryliw created the lobotomy instrument Schnauz used from scratch when he was unsuccessful with his attempts to borrow one <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> or hospital. The title of the episode, [...] "Unruhe", is the German word for [...] "unrest" [...] or [...] "anxiety". When Scully talks in German to Schnauz, she says [...] "Ich habe keine Unruhe" [...] (literally [...] "I do not have anxiety"). The episode prominently features the drug scopolamine which can cause people to quickly become unconscious, and twilight sleep, which is a condition that can render people unconscious following great moments of pain.|$|E
500|$|Dworkin's {{reports of}} {{violence}} suffered {{at the hands}} of men sometimes aroused skepticism, the most famous example being the public controversy over her allegations of being drugged and raped in Paris. In 1989, Dworkin wrote an article about her life as a battered wife in the Netherlands, [...] "What Battery Really Is", in response to fellow radical feminist Susan Brownmiller, who had argued that Hedda Nussbaum, a battered woman, should have been indicted for her failure to stop Joel Steinberg from murdering their adoptive daughter. Newsweek initially accepted [...] "What Battery Really Is" [...] for publication, but then declined to publish the account at the request of their attorney, according to Dworkin, arguing that she needed either to publish anonymously [...] "to protect the identity of the batterer" [...] and remove references to specific injuries, or to provide [...] "medical records, police records, a written statement <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> who had seen the injuries". Instead, Dworkin submitted the article to the Los Angeles Times, which published it on March 12, 1989.|$|E
