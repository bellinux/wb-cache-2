In a profanity-laced speech, Williams instructed his players to deliberately try to injure several 49ers players. He ordered his men to try to knock out running back Kendall Hunter, {{even if it meant}} hitting him out of bounds. He specifically directed them to try to tear wide receiver Michael Crabtree's ACL, injure tight end Vernon Davis' ankles and go after kick returner Kyle Williams specifically because he had a history of concussions. He also appeared to put a bounty on quarterback Alex Smith; according to Pamphilon, after Williams told his men to hit Smith in the chin, [...] "then he rubs his thumb against his index and middle fingers – the cash sign – and says, I got the <b>first</b> <b>one.</b> <b>I</b> got the first one.

He also contributed vocals to two songs ("Little Man" [...] and [...] "I'm Not Your Fool Anymore") on jazz tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards' album Mississippi Lad. Edwards was extremely complimentary of Waits' contributions, saying:Tom Waits is the one who got me my contract with PolyGram. He's wonderful, he's America's best lyricist since Johnny Mercer. He came down to the studio on the Mississippi Lad album, that's the <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> did for PolyGram, and he sang two of my songs, wouldn't accept any money, just trying to give me the best boost that he could.|$|E

I'd always been very opinionated and very you know, I always voice my ideas and whatnot in my videos, but this was the <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> actually took credit for in co-directing.

I can't you know, she came to the set dressed in different outfits that related to the circus everyday, so she's such an imaginative, creative spirit that I just have such fun working with energy like that.|$|E
