5|$|Nike Zeus was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} straightforward development of the earlier Hercules system giving it the ability to hit ICBM warheads at about the same range and altitude as the maximum performance of the Hercules. In theory, hitting a warhead is no more difficult than an aircraft; the interceptor does not have to travel any further or faster, the computers that guide it simply have to select an <b>intercept</b> <b>point</b> farther in front of the target to compensate for the target's much higher speed. In practice, the difficulty is detecting the target early enough that the <b>intercept</b> <b>point</b> is still within range of the missile. This demands much larger and more powerful radar systems, and faster computers.|$|E

2500|$|GAPA used beam riding guidance, {{in which}} the missile {{attempts}} to keep itself centred {{in the middle of}} a radar signal that is pointed directly at the target.

However, beam riding also means that the missile has to fly directly at its target, and therefore cannot [...] "lead" [...] it to a calculated <b>intercept</b> <b>point.</b> This means of guidance is generally inefficient as it requires the missile to continue maneuvering throughout the approach as the radar is moved to continue tracking the target.
