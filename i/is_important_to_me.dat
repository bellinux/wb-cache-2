500|$|In June 2011, Levine {{took part}} in an {{educational}} campaign {{to raise awareness of}} Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The project, titled [...] "Own It", was created by Shire and organized in collaboration with the Attention Deficit Disorder Association (ADDA), Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADHD). The project targets people who were previously diagnosed with the disorder, focusing on how it may continue into adulthood. Levine, who himself was diagnosed with it as a teenager, said, [...] "This campaign <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> because it can help young adults and adults realize that there's a chance they may still have ADHD if they had it as a kid". In connection to this, he wrote an article in ADDitude Magazine about his personal experience with it.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his lack}} of {{experience}} in composing film music, Prokofiev began his Kijé score confidently, later writing: [...] "I somehow had no doubts whatever about the musical language for the film". He told the producers, [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is the era, the internal meaning of each event, the personality of each hero", and warned them not to expect mere musical [...] "illustrations". He attended rehearsals and made detailed notes of the action and the acting. The period setting of the film appealed to Prokofiev; Robinson comments that the Kijé score {{is one of several}} works, including the Classical Symphony, The Love of Three Oranges, Cinderella, and War and Peace, that show [...] "the composer's fondness for the eighteenth century". The language he chose combined elements of humour and romance with an underlying melancholy—he interpreted the story as more tragic than comic. Prokofiev had heard Ravel's Boléro in Paris, and had been much impressed by the French composer's use of the saxophone, an instrument then rarely used in orchestral compositions outside France but which suited Prokofiev's intentions perfectly. The composer Gerard McBurney has pointed out the [...] "haunting sounds of the tenor saxophone" [...] that punctuate the Kijé music.|$|E
500|$|After {{four years}} in the role, Irving decided to leave Holby City and return to {{performing}} in theatre. He stated: [...] "I've had four great years but I felt {{the time had come to}} leave. The show has gone from strength to strength so now seems a good time to go." [...] Of his decision to leave, Irving explained that, while he enjoyed Meyer's sureness and confidence, he found it difficult to [...] "switch off" [...] the character outside of work, and had been forced to [...] "put the rest of his life on hold" [...] whilst part of the series, deeming it to be an [...] "intense experience." [...] He felt that, had he stayed in the series, Meyer could not have remained enigmatic much longer, and believed: [...] "you have to stop when a character's time is through." [...] Following Irving's departure from Holby City, Benji Wilson of the Radio Times questioned whether he would ever consider returning. Irving responded: [...] "I don't know–my feeling is that Meyer was of his time. He's the kind of character that belongs at the launch of series like Holby and I think that's where he should remain. The memory of Meyer <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and I want it to stay as it is." ...|$|E

A reviewer for the Washington Post found unattributed sections lifted from websites about organic tea, tobacco, and [...] "an amateurish astrology site", as well as from Wikipedia. Goodall apologised and stated, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the proper sources are credited, and I will be working diligently with my team to address all areas of concern. My goal is to ensure that when this book is released it is not only up to the highest of standards, but also that the focus be on the crucial messages it conveys." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2011, Ahern said he {{believed}} {{that he would have}} [...] "done all right" [...] in the presidential election but for the decline in the popularity of Fianna Fáil. Ahern confirmed he considered running in the election. [...] "I still would have done all right. I mean they have done some figures and I would probably sit in around 30 per cent, which you haven’t a hope with as the party is on 20 per cent." [...] He added that [...] "the party popularity is the thing that snookers it, because if your party isn’t winnable..." [...] Mr Ahern said: [...] "If there was no downturn and if it wasn’t all the hassle of the tribunals and everything else, then you could have had a good run at it." [...] He predicted that [...] "nobody is going to win it outright – like Mary McAleese had it won on the first count". Asked about a possible future candidacy in the following presidential election, he said: [...] "Normally what happens in this country, if a president does a good job they stay on, so that’s 14 years, so that ends any chance that I’ll have." [...] He also rejected suggestions that the Mahon tribunal would reject the evidence he gave on his personal finances. [...] "The only thing that <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is the central allegations. And what the tribunal says about the other trash is irrelevant." [...] Michael Martin said the former taoiseach was [...] "out of touch with reality" [...] if {{he believed}} he could have won the presidency for Fianna Fáil. Martin also said expenses paid to Mr Ahern in his capacity as a former taoiseach were too high and should be reduced. He was commenting on reports that Mr Ahern had claimed €265,000 for [...] "secretarial services" [...] and €7,500 on mobile phone bills since he stepped down in May 2008. Under the current expenses regime, a former taoiseach may employ two secretarial assistants for up to five years after leaving office and one indefinitely after that.|$|E
