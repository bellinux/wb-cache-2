50|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} involves {{identifying and}} defining accumulations of hydrocarbons that {{are trapped in}} subsurface structures. These structures are often segmented by faults. For a thorough trap evaluation, {{it is necessary to}} predict whether the fault is sealing or leaking to hydrocarbons and also to provide an estimate of how 'strong' the <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> might be. The 'strength' of a <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> can be quantified in terms of subsurface pressure, arising from the buoyancy forces within the hydrocarbon column, that the fault can support before it starts to leak. When acting on a fault zone this subsurface pressure is termed capillary threshold pressure.|$|E
50|$|In general, fault zones {{with higher}} clay content, {{equivalent}} to higher SGR values, can support higher capillary threshold pressures. On a broader scale, other factors also exert a {{control on the}} threshold pressure, such as depth of the rock sequence {{at the time of}} faulting, and the maximum burial depth. As maximum burial depth exceeds 3 km, the effective strength of the <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> will increase for all fault zone compositions.|$|E
3000|$|The {{physical}} {{principles that}} affect <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> include principal stress sealing, lithological allocation sealing, shale smear sealing, time allocation sealing and occurrence allocation sealing (Liu 1998). Single factors include fault properties, fault plane pressure, lithological allocation, fault dip angle, shale smear and fault active time. Thus, being affected by numerous factors, <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> shows very strong complexity and randomness. Fortunately, the fuzzy evaluation method can take {{various types of}} single factors that affect <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> into consideration, and hence realize a comprehensive evaluation using the principle of fuzzy transformation and maximum membership degree. Using this mathematical method, <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> properties can be effectively identified. The process is as follows: First, based on regional geology and fault development, the single factors that affect <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> are selected and quantified {{in order to obtain}} a single-factor quantization matrix U_n × 1 (n is the number of single factors). Then, based on the general division of <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> and regional requirements, the number of evaluation grades is divided (m). Finally, a single-factor membership degree matrix is constructed {{based on the number of}} evaluation grades and the oil and gas exploration results of the work area, V_ 1 × m, based on which, U_n × 1 is evaluated in order to construct a fuzzy evaluation matrix R_n × m = U_n × 1 · V_ 1 × m. Since each single factor has different contributions to <b>fault</b> <b>sealing,</b> once the weighted matrix of each single factor is provided, W_ 1 × n, the fuzzy evaluation matrix B_ 1 × m = W_ 1 × n · R_n × m can be obtained. Finally, the maximum value of the fuzzy evaluation matrix B 1 ×m [...] is taken as the corresponding evaluation grades.|$|R
30|$|The {{evaluation}} of <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> properties {{is an important}} part of oil and gas exploration and development. Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is a systematic evaluation method for <b>fault</b> <b>sealing.</b> Since traditional methods are greatly affected by human factors during the establishment of the single-factor membership degree, the assignment method results in fuzzy evaluation values, so that the result only reflects the target interval. In this paper, the dynamic clustering method was introduced to determine the single-factor membership degree. Then, a single-factor evaluation matrix was constructed using the continuous grading function in order to determine the optimum comprehensive evaluation matrix and make a fuzzy {{evaluation of}} the <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> properties. A comparison of the fuzzy evaluation and its result before and after improvement, combined with current oil and gas distribution regularity, showed that the evaluation results before and after improvement are significantly different. For faults designated as “best” and “poorest,” the evaluation results are consistent with oil and gas distribution. However, for faults designated as “good” or “poor,” the evaluation results of sealing property are not completely consistent with the oil and gas distributions. The improved results reflect the overall and local sealing properties of target zones and embody the fuzziness of <b>fault</b> <b>sealing,</b> indicating the improved method is more precise for evaluating <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> properties under complicated conditions.|$|R

30|$|Fault {{surface normal}} stress, {{which is an}} {{important}} parameter used to characterize the fault opening degree, is crucial to <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> (Fu et al. 2005). Typically, this value is the vector sum of the gravitational force imparted by the overlying strata, the regional principal compressive stress, the regional principal stress {{as well as the}} fault dip angle. Fault F 1 is a shovel fault, where the fault plane normal stress increases from the bottom to the top, where the <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> properties become better.

The influence of composition and deformation conditions on the fluid flow properties of fault zones is investigated using discrete element simulations and laboratory experiments (cf. companioning paper by Giger et al.) of samples consisting of a low-permeability clay or shale layer, embedded in porous sandstone.

40|$|Faults can {{be either}} {{conduits}} or retarders for fluid flow. As the presence of faults increases the risks for hydrocarbon exploration, the sealing behaviour of a fault zone has been a focus for geological studies in the past 30 years. Due to the widespread occurrence of fault zones, either in extensional or contractional regimes, knowledge about the fault sealing behaviour is of great importance to {{a wide spectrum of}} disciplines in geosciences, for instance, structural geology, geochemistry, petroleum geology, etc. Geologists have extensively studied the sealing properties of a fault zone over the last decades, ranging fromfault zone architecture, <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> types, <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> processes, fault rock classification, research methods and controlling factors. Although there have not been universal agreements reached on the <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> classifications, two types of fault seals have already been recognised, which are juxtaposition seals and fault rock seals. The early foundation of Allanmap and triangle juxtaposition diagramallows the investigation on the effects of stratigraphic juxtaposition between hanging wall and footwall on the sealing properties of a fault zone. The study on the detailed fault zone architecture also implies the importance of fault arrays that increase the complexity of overall stratigraphic juxtaposition between hangingwall and footwall. The <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> processes and their generated fault rocks play an important control on sealing properties of a fault zone. Temperature and stress history, which are closely related to burial history, are also found to control the sealing capacity of a fault zone to some extent. The methods such as stratigraphic juxtaposition, clay smear indices, microstructural analysis and petrophysical assessment have significantly boosted the research of fault sealing behaviour. However, further research is still needed to increase the effectiveness of present <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> analysis...|$|E
30|$|With {{constant}} {{improvements in}} petroleum geology, scholars in China and abroad have gradually realized that <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> is jointly controlled by multiple factors, {{rather than just}} one or two single factors (Lü et al. 2007; Knott 1993; Knipe et al. 1997; Faulkner et al. 2010; Gibson 1994; Zhang et al. 2013; Pei et al. 2015). With a deepening of quantitative single-factor studies of <b>fault</b> <b>sealing,</b> many scholars tried to comprehensively evaluate <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> using mathematical theory methods, including nonlinear mapping methods, gray relational, logical information, fault connectivity probabilistic methods and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods (Fu et al. 2005, 2008, 2012; Lü et al. 1995; Lü and Fu 2002; Zhang et al. 2007; Jiang et al. 2008; Li 2009; Zhang et al. 2015). However, for all these methods, some key parameters are difficult to obtain and have regional limitations, so that human factors are generally introduced for value assignment or adjustment. Thus, scholars manage to optimize these parameters using a variety of mathematical approaches. Among them, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, which is strongly systematic and provides definite results, is accepted by many scholars and has been gradually improved over the years.|$|R
30|$|However, the {{improved}} method still has its limitations. First of all, this method still cannot solve the multi-scale <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> problem. As mentioned above, the N 1 s 1 section in profile III displays strong heterogeneity, {{and although the}} evaluation results of large scale are “poor,” the <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> properties exist at small scales. Secondly, this method can only explain the sealing properties of the faults in profile. When oil and gas migrate in multiple directions, the evaluation results will not be consistent with drilling results. For example, the evaluation results of section K in the III and IV profiles are good, but the fault is oil bearing in the hanging wall. This phenomenon is related to a two-way oil supply. Oil source comparison shows that {{the oil and gas}} migration in the study area is from east to west in the Changji Sag and from south to north in the Sikeshu Sag (Song et al. 2007). Therefore, this method is only applicable for studies of single-scale <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> properties. In addition, the direction of oil and gas migration should be vertical to the fault plane.|$|R
30|$|However, {{there are}} various methods {{that can be used}} to acquire the {{parameters}} mentioned above, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and which are constantly optimized (Lü and Fu 2002; Russell et al. 2003; Fu et al. 2012; Li et al. 2009). There are many single factors that affect <b>fault</b> <b>sealing,</b> generally including <b>fault</b> properties, fault plane pressure, fault lithological allocation and shale smear. Evaluation grades can be divided into five ranks: good, better, moderate, fairly poor and poor. The single-factor membership degree can be obtained via a discrete function method and/or a continuous function method. The former applies to qualitative single-factor membership degree, such as fault properties, while the latter applies to quantitative single-factor membership degree, such as fault plane pressure. Weighting coefficients can be obtained via the expert survey method, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), Delphi method and/or the weight matrix method (Ding and Jin 2012; Sun and Wu 1995; Qiu et al. 2007). The larger the weighting coefficient of a single factor, the greater the impact of the single factor on <b>fault</b> <b>sealing.</b> The mathematical model of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation includes the weighted-average type, the main factor highlight type and the main factor determination type (Sun et al. 2010). The weighted-average type can take a variety of single factors into consideration in order to avoid information loss. The main factor highlight type and the main factor determination type emphasize the main controlling factors and prevent interference factors. In the evaluation process of <b>fault</b> <b>sealing,</b> many scholars use the weighted-average type. However, determining the above parameters and effectively predicting <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> must be based on the actual petroleum geology of the study area and from suggestions made by local experts in order to reduce exploration risks.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that fault rock capillary properties {{are important in}} controlling the distribution of hydrocarbons in sedimentary basins, and methods exist for predicting the capillary seal capacity of prospect bounding faults. However, <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> capacity is rarely incorporated into models of hydrocarbon migration. This paper {{presents the results of}} migration modelling of the Oseberg Syd area of the Viking Graben incorporating fault rock capillary properties. Seal capacity is calculated in the model as a function of Shale Gouge Ratio (SGR), i. e. the percentage shale in the sequence moved past a point on a fault. Over 3 000 model realisations were run for different SGR to <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> capacity relationships and the calculated hydrocarbon distributions were compared with known distributions. Realisations were ranked according to the closeness of fit between model and actual oil-water contacts for 7 traps. The best-fit to all 7 traps was provided by realisations with significant seal capacity at SGR values greater than ca. 0. 2; a value which is in agreement with an independently derived fault-by-fault calibration between SGR and seal capacity. The level of fill calculated for an individual trap is extremely sensitive to minor changes in the seal capacity relationship because it is controlled not only by the seal capacities of the faults that bound the trap, but also by the pattern of fill-spill of upstream traps. This sensitivity to minor changes in seal capacity introduces large uncertainties when <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> capacity relationships are used in a predictive mode and emphasises the requirement for migration modelling in <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> prospect evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The {{overarching}} goal of {{fault zone}} analysis is to accurately estimate fault mechanical and hydraulic properties {{that may influence}} the connectivity either across a fault or along a fault and between reservoirs under variable stress conditions. <b>Fault</b> <b>seal</b> capacity is the term {{used to describe the}} ability of the fault to impede the migration of one or more fluid types under certain stress constraints. Academics and industry technologists have developed a number of techniques for assessing various physical characteristics of faults and these have often been grounded either in outcrop analogues or observations of faults in the subsurface thought to be either trapping hydrocarbons or showing evidence of breach.

The parameter characterizing possible sand shale contraposition is the sand/formation ratio, which is the ratio between the sandstone and layer formation thicknesses, N/G. When N/G is large, the possibility of a sand–sand connection is large, and hence the <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> ability is poor. When the N/G ratio is small, the <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> ability is in fact good. However, this single factor does not take the fault throw generated by fault slipping into consideration, Therefore, the following single factor is added.|$|R
30|$|In this study, the {{membership}} degree of each single factor is established {{by applying the}} dynamic clustering method. Based on a large sample dataset, pre-classification is roughly performed. Then, gradual adjustment is made until a reasonable classification is obtained. The maximum and minimum values of each class constitute the range of membership degrees. For <b>fault</b> <b>sealing,</b> the single-factor membership degree is established as follows: Firstly, {{a large number of}} samples of one single factor of the work area and their corresponding oil–gas show are constructed. Then, taking best, good, poor and poorest oil and gas show as the standard, the range of {{the membership}} degrees of the fault gouge ratio is determined. This means that the fault gouge ratio of a given area is clustered. In the process of clustering, the maximum and minimum values are the range limits of membership degree. The so-called dynamic clustering means the gradual adjustment of a value to a reasonable range using the dynamic clustering principle. This method has the advantages of incorporating the oil and gas geology of the study area, so that it has regional eigenvalues. It is closely related to the <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> properties of the study area and hence has a certain degree of predictability. The advantage of this method is that the regional petroleum geology has a regional characteristic value which is related to <b>fault</b> <b>sealing,</b> and is predictive.|$|R

40|$|The use of Shale-Gouge-Ratio (SGR) {{methods to}} predict across-fault seal {{capacity}} {{relies on a}} calibration of the methodology against field examples.

Recent work on hydrodynamics and seal capacity has provided insight on fine-tuning the calibration methodologies that should in turn lead to improved <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> capacity predictions.

For a fault that defines a hydraulic head discontinuity at the reservoir scale, there exists a hydraulic head gradient or distribution within the fault-zone that is determined by the detailed permeability distribution within the fault zone. As a result, the capillary threshold pressure varies across the fault. When compared with the hydraulic head, the fault zone seal capacity can be estimated at various locations within the fault zone. Theoretical examination of membrane seal capacity for various permeability distributions can be used to understand parameters that control the location of the critical leak point for a membrane <b>fault</b> <b>seal.</b> This can also be extended to examine possible up-fault leakage.

In this study, the characteristics of faults, as possible seals, are analysed, based on the latest well and 3 D seismic data. Evaluating <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> risk is a constitutive factor in hydrocarbon exploration and production. For this reason, to reduce uncertainty in the faults’ leaking facilities, we used a couple of known approaches, such as juxtaposition analysis, with building Allan diagrams, to determine the relationship between sand-sand juxtaposition and the occurrence of hydrocarbons-bearing sands. We used the Shale Gouge Ratio (SGR) calculation with prediction of clay content distribution along the faults, pressure data analysis, seismic at tributes modelling and self-organized map clustering analysis for accurate delineation of sand bodies shape. This represents a complex research method of integration of high-quality depth processing with seismic structural and stratigraphic interpretation and, also, geological modeling. In this paper, we assessed the Jurassic and Visean faults of the Solokha gas field, according to their fluid cross-flow facilities.

According to the field application, the relative error calculated by the model proposed in this paper is within ± 15 %. It is an effective evaluation method for the productivity of horizontal wells in fault block reservoirs. The productivity of the horizontal well increases logarithmically as the distance between the horizontal well and the fault increases.

30|$|Throughout {{geological}} history, faults {{have played}} {{a very important role}} in hydrocarbon migration and accumulation. Large faults, which form the boundaries of oil and gas fields, can generally control hydrocarbon accumulation (Agosta et al. 2012; Allan 1989; Balsamo et al. 2010; Bouvier et al. 1989; Braathen et al. 2009; Brogi and Novellino 2015; Choi et al. 2015; Collettini et al. 2014; Fisher and Jolley 2007). However, small faults generally separate oil and gas, resulting in an increase in well spacing that poses challenges in oil and gas exploration. Thereby, studies of <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> have become a very important focus for oil and gas exploration and development (Ciftci et al. 2013; Collettini et al. 2014; Davatzes and Aydin 2005; Fachri et al. 2013 a, b). Studies of <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> have evolved from trap theory, which is used to identify hydrocarbon sealing mechanism(s) and physical parameters of faults (Hubbert 1953; Smith 1980). Based on different mathematical principles and modes, the sealing properties of one or more given faults are quantitatively identified and predicted by considering various sealing mechanisms and factors. (Childs et al. 2009; Egholm et al. 2008; Fachri et al. 2011; Faulkner et al. 2003; Fisher and Knipe 1998; Wu et al. 2010; Knipe et al. 1997).|$|R

For this case study we used Eclipse reservoir modeling. The model for the Permian Upper Rotliegend Group includes the numerous gas fields in the area. Based on the configuration of these gas fields in combination with the observed regional overpressure distribution the original fault model could be improved. By creating a ‘dynamically stable’ model, fault multipliers were determined which gave a pressure drop below 1 bar over a period of 5000 years. The resulting distribution of the fault multipliers over the model area clearly identified differences within the study area. A large part of the estimated <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> capacity could be explained by the geometry of the fault (offset and sand-sand juxtaposition).

Late structural development of the P–M trap with respect to charge {{was thought to be}} the reason for under-filling. However, seismic amplitude anomalies and gas shows above the reservoir suggest vertical leakage may have controlled column heights. Hydrodynamic analysis of pressure data also suggests that faults separating the fields act as barriers to the migration of hydrocarbons and water, whilst faults within the Macedon Field do not. The reasons for hydrocarbon leakage and the difference in <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> capacities are investigated by integrating field observations, analysis of pressure and stress data, the appraisal of top (mercury porosimetry measurements) and fault (Shale Gouge Ratios; SGR) membrane seal capacities, constraining geomechanical properties (top and fault seals) and well-based fracture analysis. The top seals are at a low risk of capillary failure, but vertical leakage is possible via dynamic failure along pre-existing faults and conductive fractures, and lateral leakage across reservoir against thief zone fault juxtapositions. The difference in observed <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> capacities between different faults is explained by a combination of the spatial distributions of SGR and buoyancy pressure. The procedure presented delivers a robust description of the key risks concerning reservoir connectivity and the integrity and capacity of seals where static (geological timescale migration) and dynamic (tectonically related flow) conditions must be considered.

40|$|Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a {{suite of}} {{technologies}} available to directly reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions to the atmosphere from fossil fuelled power plants and large industrial point sources. For a safe deployment of CCS {{it is important that}} CO 2 injected into deep geological formations does not migrate out of the storage site. Characterising and understanding possible migration mechanisms and pathways along which migration may occur is therefore crucial to ensure secure engineered storage of anthropogenic CO 2. In this thesis naturally occurring CO 2 accumulations in the subsurface are studied as analogue sites for engineered storage sites with respect to CO 2 migration pathways and mechanisms that ensure the retention of CO 2 in the subsurface. Geological data of natural CO 2 reservoirs world-wide has been compiled from published literature and analysed. Results show that faults are the main pathways for migration of CO 2 from subsurface reservoirs to the surface and that the state and density of CO 2, pressure of the reservoir, and thickness of the caprock influence the successful retention of CO 2. Gaseous, low density CO 2, overpressured reservoirs, and thin caprocks are characteristics of insecure storage sites. Two natural CO 2 reservoirs have been studied in detail with respect to their <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> properties. This includes the first study of how fault rock seals behave in CO 2 reservoirs. It has been shown that the bounding fault of the Fizzy Field reservoir in the southern North Sea can with hold the amount of CO 2 trapped in the reservoir at current time. A initially higher gas column would have led to across fault migration of CO 2 as the fault rock seals {{would not have been able}} to withhold higher pressures. Depending on the present day stress regime the fault could be close to failure. At the natural CO 2 reservoir of St. Johns Dome, Arizona, migration of CO 2 to the surface has been occurring for at least the last 500 ka. <b>Fault</b> <b>seal</b> analysis shows that this migration is related to the fault rock composition and the orientation of the bounding fault in the present day stress field. Using the U-Th disequilibrium method the ages of travertine deposits of the St. Johns Dome area have been determined. The results illustrate that along one fault CO 2 migration took place for at least 480 ka and that individual travertine mounds have had long lifespans of up to 350 ka. Age and uranium isotope trends along the fault have been interpreted as signs of a shrinking CO 2 reservoir. The amount of CO 2 calculated to have migrated out of the St. Johns Dome is up to 113 Gt. Calculated rates span from 5 t/yr to 30, 000 t/yr and indicate that at the worst case large amounts of CO 2 can migrate rapidly from the subsurface reservoir along faults to the surface. This thesis highlights the importance of faults as fluid pathways for vertical migration of CO 2. It has been also shown that they can act as baffles for CO 2 migration and that whether a fault acts as pathway or baffle for CO 2 can be predicted using <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> analysis. However, further work is needed in order to minimise the uncertainties of <b>fault</b> <b>seal</b> analysis for CO 2 reservoirs...|$|E

40|$|Fractures {{significantly}} {{enhance the}} {{flow rate in}} rocks, if fracture density is high (Taylor 1999, Cox et al. 2001). This leads to rapid flux along a hydraulic gradient from high to low pressure reservoirs, and is represented in rocks as veins. Veins are precipitates from supersaturated fluid, and are formed by a change in pressure, temperature or geochemistry. The solubility of vein forming minerals such as quartz, calcite or halite is generally low and thus large (and sometimes unreasonable) fluid volumes are required {{to account for the}} precipitated mass. Rapid ascent of solution may explain the high supersaturation needed to seal fractures, either by fluid flow along deep reaching faults due to seismic ruptures, or mobile hydrofractures driven by pressure gradients in fluid filled fractured at deeper crustal sections (Bons 2001, Miller 2002). The vein microstructure is a unique tool to unravel the fracture sealing process. The most indicative microstructures are fractured minerals, which were sealed by a fluid of different composition. The repeated presence of fluid and solid host rock inclusions in fibrous, stretched crystal type veins (minerals which extend across the vein and into the host rock) also indicate repeated fracture-sealing processes (Ramsay 1980), although their presence is not a sufficient criteria (Hilgers 2005). In this study, we outline the different <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> processes associated in a still seismic zone. The faults are located in Carboniferous limestones, and thus present an analogue for <b>fault</b> <b>sealing</b> processes in hydrocarbon reservoirs and an in-depth study of seismogenic faults...|$|R
