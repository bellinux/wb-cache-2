Traditionally, {{this has been}} in the form of multiple paper (or microfiche) manuals encompassing millions of pages including hundreds of thousands of technical illustrations.

The Boeing Company is providing ever increasing amounts of this documentation in electronic form in a family of digital data products. The requirement for users to be able to interact intelligently with the illustrations is evident. In particular, users need a system that: • provides hyperlinks within illustrations so that users can navigate from graphic to graphic and from graphic to text • aids users in understanding complex schematics such as wiring diagrams • provides full text search capability across all text and graphic...|$|R
