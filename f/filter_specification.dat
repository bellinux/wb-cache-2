40|$|This paper {{presents}} an evolutionary design of digital IIR filters using the genetic algorithm (GA) with modified genetic operators and real-valued encoding. Conventional digital IIR filter design methods involve algebraic transformations {{of the transfer}} function of an analog low-pass filter (LPF) that satisfies prescribed <b>filter</b> <b>specifications.</b> Other types of frequency-selective digital filters as high-pass (HPF), band-pass (BPF), and band-stop (BSF) filters are obtained by appropriate transformations of a prototype low-pass filter. In the GA-based digital IIR filter design scheme, filter coefficients are represented {{as a set of}} real-valued genes in a chromosome. Each chromosome represents the structure and weights of an individual filter. GA directly finds the coefficients of the desired filter transfer function through genetic search for given <b>filter</b> <b>specifications</b> of minimum <b>filter</b> order. Crossover and mutation operators are selected to ensure the stability of resulting IIR filters. Other types of filters can be found independently from the <b>filter</b> <b>specifications,</b> not from algebraic transformations. 1...|$|R

50|$|In {{electronic}} filter design, a <b>filter</b> <b>specification</b> may require {{that within the}} filter passband, the gain is nominally 0 dB ± {{a small number of}} dB, for example within the ±1 dB interval. In the stopband(s), the required attenuation in dB is above a certain level, for example >100 dB. In a transition band the gain is not specified. In this case, the filter bandwidth corresponds to the passband width, which in this example is the 1 dB-bandwidth. If the filter shows amplitude ripple within the passband, the x dB point refers {{to the point where the}} gain is x dB below the nominal passband gain rather than x dB below the maximum gain.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} {{for the design of}} linear phase FIR filters with signed-powers-of-two (SPT) coefficients is proposed. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem is formulated that minimizes the number of SPT terms for a given <b>filter</b> <b>specification.</b> The method is applicable both for filters with a specified passband gain and filters where the normalized peak ripple magnitude is of interest. In both cases the globally minimal solution is found subject to the <b>filter</b> <b>specification,</b> filter order, and number of coefficient bits. A preprocessing method that removes 30 - 50 % of the variables is also proposed and it is shown by an example that this method speeds up the optimization process significantly. ...|$|E
