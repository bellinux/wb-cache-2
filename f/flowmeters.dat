50|$|Custody {{transfer}} {{is one of}} the most important applications for flow measurement. Many flow measurement technologies are used for custody transfer applications; these include differential pressure (DP) <b>flowmeters,</b> turbine <b>flowmeters,</b> positive displacement <b>flowmeters,</b> Coriolis <b>flowmeters</b> and ultrasonic <b>flowmeters.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ultrasonic {{flow meters}} come in three {{different}} types: transmission (contrapropagating transit time) <b>flowmeters,</b> reflection (Doppler) <b>flowmeters,</b> and open-channel <b>flowmeters.</b> Transit time <b>flowmeters</b> work by measuring the time difference between an ultrasonic pulse sent in the flow direction and an ultrasound pulse sent opposite the flow direction. Doppler <b>flowmeters</b> measure the doppler shift resulting in reflecting an ultrasonic beam off either small particles in the fluid, air bubbles in the fluid, or the flowing fluid's turbulence. Open channel flow meters measure upstream levels in front of flumes or weirs.|$|E
50|$|The turbine {{flowmeter}} is {{most useful}} when measuring clean, steady, high-speed flow of low-viscosity fluids. In comparison to other <b>flowmeters,</b> the turbine flowmeter {{has a significant}} cost advantage over ultrasonic <b>flowmeters,</b> especially in the larger line sizes, and {{it also has a}} favourable price compared to the prices of DP <b>flowmeters,</b> especially in cases where one turbine meter can replace several DP meters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The olivary <b>flowmeter,</b> a {{new type}} of {{differential}} pressure <b>flowmeter,</b> was presented. Its pressure loss was explored through experimental research. The experimental medium is diesel. In the condition of the same effective area of circulation, the pressure loss of the olivary and the orifice plate <b>flowmeter</b> was compared. As a result, the pressure loss of the olivary <b>flowmeter</b> is 14. 9 % of the orifice plate <b>flowmeter</b> at most, 7. 2 % on average. The olivary <b>flowmeter</b> can reduce energy consumption...|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) Fuel <b>Flowmeter</b> {{is located}} in the duct between the low and high {{pressure}} fuel turbopumps. In the <b>flowmeter</b> the rotation rate of a 4 -blade rotor positioned downstream of two flow straighteners is employed to measure the engine fuel flow rate and thereby control the engine mixture ratio via the engine controller. Hence, inaccurate operation of the <b>flowmeter</b> could have serious consequences for SSME engine operation and performance, forcing, for example, tanking of extra fuel to allow for inaccurate <b>flowmeter</b> measurement. Since the current flight <b>flowmeter</b> configuration was incorporated into the SSME in the early eighties, some anomalies in <b>flowmeter</b> behavior have been observed. The initial <b>flowmeter</b> incorporated an "egg crate" design for the two flow straighteners which turn the duct flow to make it more uniform and parallel after it has come out of the 90 degree bend just upstream of the <b>flowmeter...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel and}} {{oxidizer}} <b>flowmeters</b> were helical-vaned, rotor-type <b>flowmeters.</b> They {{were located in}} the fuel and oxidizer high-pressure ducts. The <b>flowmeters</b> measured propellant flowrates in the high-pressure propellant ducts. The four-vane rotor in the hydrogen system produced four electrical impulses per revolution and turned approximately 3,700 rpm at nominal flow. The six-vane rotor in the LOX system produced six electrical impulses per revolution and turned at approximately 2,600 rpm at nominal flow.|$|E
5000|$|Thorpe tube <b>flowmeters</b> are {{designed}} for use only on systems not supplying more than 50 PSI ( [...] about 3 bar). The <b>flowmeters</b> will be labelled for the gas they are specific to. Additional color-coding may be used, for example, O2 <b>flowmeters</b> may have white and green labels, since white and green are respectively the Canadian and American colours identifying this gas. The flowmeter will have a safety Relief valve to relieve excess pressure.|$|E
50|$|Lorentz force <b>flowmeters</b> {{are usually}} {{classified}} in several main conceptual setups. Some of them designed as static <b>flowmeters</b> where the magnet system is at rest and one measures the force acting on it. Alternatively, {{they can be}} designed as rotary <b>flowmeters</b> where the magnets are arranged on a rotating wheel and the spinning velocity {{is a measure of}} the flow velocity. Obviously, the force acting on a Lorentz force flowmeter depends both on the velocity distribution and on the shape of the magnet system. This classification depends on the relative direction of the magnetic field that is being applied respect to the direction of the flow. In Figure 3 one can distinguish diagrams of the longitudinal and the transverse Lorentz force <b>flowmeters.</b>|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to develop the <b>flowmeter</b> with flow range (50 - 200) ml/hr. In the {{presented}} investigation, the problem of accurate determination of low mass flow was studied. In this paper a <b>flowmeter</b> design applicable for measurement of low gas flow amounts is presented. To this end, the numeric model of designed <b>flowmeter</b> was made and the <b>flowmeter</b> was numerically simulated using compressible Navier - Stokes equations in two and three dimensions.

50|$|The use of {{ultrasonic}} <b>flowmeters</b> {{is continuing}} to grow for custody transfer. Unlike PD and turbine meters, ultrasonic <b>flowmeters</b> do not have moving parts. Pressure drop is much reduced with an ultrasonic meter when compared to PD, turbine, and DP meters. Installation of ultrasonic meters is relatively straightforward, and maintenance requirements are low.|$|E
50|$|Ultrasonic <b>flowmeters</b> {{were first}} {{introduced}} into industrial markets in 1963 by Tokyo Keiki (now Tokimec) in Japan. Custody transfer measurements {{have been around}} for a long time, and over the past ten years, Coriolis and ultrasonic meters have become the <b>flowmeters</b> of choice for custody transfer in the oil and gas industry.|$|E
50|$|Although Thorpe tube <b>flowmeters</b> {{are very}} similar in design and {{function}} to rotameters, the latter are more accurate. As a result, Thorpe fube <b>flowmeters</b> are often checked against rotameters to ensure their accuracy.

The turbine {{wheel of the}} <b>flowmeter</b> is mounted on a 	float, and the float is on liquid so that the friction 	against {{the rotation of the}} turbine wheel due to friction 	of the float to liquid is reduced to be negligible at 	slow rotating speeds.

50|$|An {{advantage}} {{of using a}} DP <b>flowmeters</b> {{is that they are}} the most studied and best understood type of flowmeter. A dis{{advantage of}} using a DP <b>flowmeters</b> is that they introduce a pressure drop into the flowmeter line. This is a necessary result of the constriction in the line that is required to make the DP flow measurement.|$|E
50|$|Positive {{displacement}} (PD) <b>flowmeters</b> {{are highly}} accurate meters that {{are widely used}} for custody transfer of commercial and industrial water, {{as well as for}} custody transfer of many other liquids. PD <b>flowmeters</b> have the advantage that they have been approved by a number of regulatory bodies for this purpose, and they have not yet been displaced by other applications.|$|E
50|$|The {{nutating}} {{motion is}} widely employed in <b>flowmeters</b> and pumps. The displacement of volume for one revolution is first determined.

50|$|If the {{magnetic}} field direction were constant, electrochemical and other effects at the electrodes would make the potential difference difficult to distinguish from the fluid flow induced potential difference.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a combined field, laboratory, and numerical study of electromagnetic borehole <b>flowmeter</b> measurements acquired {{without the use}} of a packer or skirt to block bypass flow around the <b>flowmeter.</b> The most significant finding is that inflow through the wellbore screen changes the ratio of flow through the <b>flowmeter</b> to wellbore flow. Experiments reveal up to a factor of two differences in this ratio for conditions with and without inflow through the wellbore screen. Standard practice is to assume the ratio is constant. A numerical model has been developed to simulate the effect of inflow on the <b>flowmeter.</b> The model is formulated using momentum conservation within the borehole and around the <b>flowmeter.</b> The model is embedded in the MODFLOW- 2000 ground water flow code...|$|R
