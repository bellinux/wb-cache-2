5|$|In {{international}} politics, {{food power}} {{is the use of}} agriculture as a means of political control whereby one nation or group of nations offers or withholds commodities from another nation or group of nations in order to manipulate behavior. Its potential use as a weapon was recognised after OPEC’s earlier use of oil as a political weapon. <b>Food</b> <b>has</b> a major influence on political actions of a nation. In response to acts of food power, a nation usually acts in the interest of its citizens to provide food.|$|E
5|$|Modern deep frying {{began in}} the 19th century with the growing {{popularity}} of cast iron, particularly around the American South which {{led to the development of}} many modern deep-fried dishes. French fries, invented in the late 18th century, became popular in the early 19th century western Europe. Doughnuts were invented in the mid-19th century, with foods such as onion rings, deep-fried turkey, and corn dogs all being invented in the early 20th century. In recent years, the growth of fast <b>food</b> <b>has</b> expanded the reach of deep-fried foods, especially French fries.|$|E
5|$|Prey may {{be crushed}} to death if large or eaten alive if small, {{swallowed}} head-first, and helped down by muscular contractions and neck flexing. Unusually, after <b>food</b> <b>has</b> been swallowed, the Gila monster immediately resumes tongue flicking and search behavior, probably {{as a result}} of a history of finding clumped prey such as eggs and young in nests. Gila monsters are able to climb trees and cacti in search of eggs.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{states that}} zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose, causing anosmia. Reports of anosmia were also {{observed}} in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections. On June 16, 2009, the FDA ordered removal of zinc-based intranasal cold products from store shelves. The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke, and cannot tell if <b>food</b> <b>has</b> spoiled before they eat it.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of genetic engineering, a whole new type of <b>food</b> <b>has</b> been brought into the world, and {{scholars}} in both academia and Judaic faith have differing viewpoints on whether these new strains of foods are to be considered kosher or not. The first genetically modified animal approved by the FDA for human consumption is the AquAdvantage salmon, and while salmon is normally an acceptably kosher food, this modified organism has a gene from a nonkosher organism.|$|E
5|$|An embargo is not {{the same}} as Food Power, however, food power can be used in an embargo. In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of {{restricted}} items often fail. For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany. However, the embargo was not complete nor effective until food was added to the list of restricted materials. <b>Food</b> <b>has</b> the real power. After food was introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food. Because the Allied Powers used the power of food in their embargo, Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.|$|E

5|$|The toxins in A.muscaria are water-soluble. When sliced thinly, or {{finely diced}} and boiled in {{plentiful}} water until thoroughly cooked, {{it seems to}} be detoxified. Although its consumption as a <b>food</b> <b>has</b> never been widespread, the consumption of detoxified A.muscaria has been practiced in some parts of Europe (notably by Russian settlers in Siberia) since at least the 19th century, and likely earlier. The German physician and naturalist Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th century, the French physician Félix Archimède Pouchet was a populariser and advocate of A.muscaria consumption, comparing it to manioc, an important food source in tropical South America that must be detoxified before consumption.|$|E
25|$|Variable, yet {{relatively}} {{rapid rate}} of absorption with a time to peak concentration of 2.8-3.9 hours. Bioavailability is close to 100% and <b>food</b> <b>has</b> {{no effect on the}} bioavailability of zonisamide but may affect the {{rate of absorption}}.|$|E
25|$|Aftertastes arise after <b>food</b> <b>has</b> been swallowed. An aftertaste can {{differ from}} the food it follows. Medicines and tablets may also have a {{lingering}} aftertaste, as they can contain certain artificial flavor compounds, such as aspartame (artificial sweetener).|$|E

25|$|Bengali <b>food</b> <b>has</b> {{inherited}} {{a large number}} of influences, both foreign and pan-Indian, arising from a historical and strong trade links with many parts of the world.

25|$|Processed foods, high-fructose corn syrup, and {{increased}} fat—the greater reliance on processed, packaged, microwaveable <b>food</b> <b>has</b> {{resulted in a}} rise in Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and other health concerns.

50|$|British fast <b>food</b> <b>had</b> {{considerable}} regional variation.

Since the Second World War, turkey has been used more frequently in fast <b>food.</b> The UK <b>has</b> adopted fast <b>food</b> from other cultures as well, such as pizza, kebab, and curry.

25|$|Drive {{theory has}} some {{intuitive}} or folk validity.

There are several problems, however, that leave the validity of drive reduction open for debate.|$|E
