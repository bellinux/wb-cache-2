500|$|In 1935, Somervell was {{appointed}} {{as head of}} the Works Project Administration in New York City. Over the next {{three and a half years}} he spent $10,000,000 a month on Great Depression relief works. He worked with the local politicians and labor leaders. He upheld the right of workers to form unions and improved relations with left-wing groups, once declaring that [...] "I wouldn't know a Red if <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one,</b> and wouldn't do anything about it if I did". The biggest project was the construction of LaGuardia Airport. Somervell established a reputation as a man who could handle projects involving hundreds of thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars.|$|E
2500|$|People {{talk about}} [...] "chav behaviour" [...] or [...] "chav insults" [...] {{and that sort}} of thing. Oh, don't believe the popular etymologies that you read {{sometimes}} in the press and on websites. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> the other day, people said, [...] "It's an acronym, 'chav', from 'council house and violent'"—well, no, it isn't, that was made up in recent times.|$|E
2500|$|Rowling stated on her {{website that}} the Harry Potter phrases 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' {{compared}} to [...] "some {{of the real}} charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> in the Holocaust Museum in Washington when I had already devised the 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' definitions, and was chilled to notice the similarity.|$|E
60|$|We rushed on deck. I {{seized the}} boat-hook {{and looked over}} the side. But <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> no <b>one.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the <b>one</b> she meant, {{a little}} chap {{operating}} in a detached sort of way above a spinney.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the second}} half of 1959, I took a long-distance bus from Xinyang to Luoshan and Gushi. Out of the window, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> corpse after another in the ditches. On the bus, no one dared to mention the dead. In one county, Guangshan, one-third of the people had died. Although there were dead people everywhere, the local leaders enjoyed good meals and fine liquor. ... I had seen people who had told the truth being destroyed. Did I dare to write it? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{remaining}} lions were roaring horribly. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> sneaking {{very slowly}} {{up the stairs}} toward us.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> but {{a moment}} ago--that is because I am lucky. It was coming behind me, {{but it was}} not laughing.|$|E
60|$|JAMES. What {{about that}} woman he was mixed up with? <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> some <b>one</b> uncommonly like her outside {{as we came}} in.|$|R
60|$|When I {{reached the}} deck, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> no <b>one</b> {{but a large}} man in a large {{dripping}} pea-jacket, who was calking down the main-hatches.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle, {{what is an}} association? <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>one.</b> What is its length, breadth, weight, value--ay, VALUE? What {{price will}} it bring in the market?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> of the buffaloes myself." [...] Captain Moore paused, {{not knowing}} how to go on. [...] "You are pretty close to the fort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw him, too. Just before I came in. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> of the {{men that}} visited us at Slingerland's.... Big, hulking fellow--red, ugly face--bad look." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, plague if you like,' Ollyett replied. 'They're {{only five}} measly Shorthorns. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> lying {{down in the}} park. She'll serve as a sub-stratum of fact.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> some <b>one</b> in the garden," [...] {{returned}} Demorest, quietly, satisfied of {{the illusion}} of his senses, [...] "but it was a mistake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've eaten cat-fish, but <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> like that," [...] she said. [...] "Look at its horrible mouth! And it has {{whiskers}} like a cat!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He sure does. Lions {{are never}} sure of their balance in a tree. But <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> make a misstep. He knows he doesn't belong there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Macumazahn," [...] he said, [...] "we had best be going, {{for those}} Umtetwas are coming back. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> {{of them on}} the brow of the rise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{is it that}} a fly {{can kill}} a horse? They are not larger than our blue-bottles at home, for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> in a naturalist's window in Pieter-Maritzburg." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was a smart}} man, though, to make a cuckoo-clock. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> myself, one time, {{and it was a}} {{wonderful}} thing. The cuckoo told what time it was every hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My window looks this way," [...] she said, [...] "and I fancied that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> some <b>one</b> {{cross the}} Park while I was dressing. The spinney gate was {{certainly}} open." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The horse dealer from St. Louis!" [...] ejaculated Pan in {{tremendous}} relief. [...] "Blink, I believe you're right. <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> {{of those}} men before, or the horses either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's go out {{and walk}} on the {{platform}} until the train starts," [...] suggested Honora, desperately. [...] "Oh, Howard, the shades are up! I'm sure <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> some <b>one</b> looking in!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, captin; no offence," [...] ses Ginger, {{holding up}} his ’and. [...] "I dreamt <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> on your mantelpiece, I s’pose. P’r’aps I oughtn’t to ha’ said {{anything}} about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll be {{off before}} long," [...] said one old soldier. [...] "I know because <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> of the captains saying good-by to his family. Such a parting means a good deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ten {{minutes ago}} <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> go by, {{followed}} by M. de St. Auban and a gentleman who greatly resembled M. de Vilmorin, besides an escort {{of four of}} the most villainous knaves--" ...|$|E
60|$|Out of {{the tail}} of my eye <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the center fielder running. When I rounded first base I {{got a good look}} at this fielder, and though I had seen the {{greatest}} outfielders the game ever produced, <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> that covered ground so swiftly as he.|$|R
6000|$|Alice {{could not}} help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: 'Do you know, I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters, too! <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> alive before!' ...|$|R
60|$|Isa. How Loveby fidges up and down! In what pain he is! well, {{if these}} be not they, they call whores, I'll be hanged, though <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> before. [Aside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{the game}} was about up. Already <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> man throw down his spear in token of surrender--which act of cowardice cost him his life, by the way--when {{suddenly}} a shout arose.|$|E
60|$|His {{attentive}} face relaxed a little. But <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> of his feet, softly, quietly, incessantly {{beating on}} the carpet under the table, and I {{felt that he was}} secretly as anxious as ever.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{was how it}} was. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> of them above---not Stebbing---No--- {{coming out}} to the brow; and after this last frost, not a doubt but {{that must have been}} enough to bring it down.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is a rare}} good fellow {{you have}} got there, that black with the curious hair," [...] the latter said. [...] "What is the man? <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> like him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This morning," [...] she said, [...] "it {{seemed to}} me that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>one</b> moment an epitome of your life. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> every nerve of your body strained, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you wound up to a great effort. It was to catch a ball! You succeeded, I believe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gee! Let me see." [...] She got up {{and came}} round to peer down closely, to finger the decoration. [...] "French! <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> before.... Daren, haven't you an American medal too?" ...|$|R
