5|$|Data {{is written}} to the flash memory in units called pages (made up of {{multiple}} cells). However, the memory can be erased only in larger units called blocks (made up of multiple pages). If the <b>data</b> <b>in</b> some of {{the pages of the}} block are no longer needed (also called stale pages), only the pages with good <b>data</b> <b>in</b> that block are read and rewritten into another previously erased empty block. Then the free pages left by not moving the stale data are available for new data. This is a process called garbage collection (GC). All SSDs include some level of garbage collection, but they may differ in when and how fast they perform the process. Garbage collection {{is a big part of}} write amplification on the SSD.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{staggering}} {{growth in}} Internet of Things (IoTs) technologies {{is the key}} driver for generation of massive raw <b>data</b> streams <b>in</b> big <b>data</b> environments. <b>In</b> addition, the collection of raw <b>data</b> streams <b>in</b> big <b>data</b> systems increases computational complexity and resource consumption <b>in</b> cloud-enabled <b>data</b> mining systems. <b>In</b> this paper, we are introducing the concept of pattern-based <b>data</b> sharing <b>in</b> big <b>data</b> environments. The proposed methodology enables local data processing near the data sources and transforms the raw data streams into actionable knowledge patterns. These knowledge patterns have dual utility of availability of local knowledge patterns for immediate actions {{as well as for}} participatory <b>data</b> sharing <b>in</b> big <b>data</b> environments. The proposed concept has the wide potential to be applied in numerous application areas...|$|R
