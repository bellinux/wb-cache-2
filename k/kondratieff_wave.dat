30|$|The rise of Nokia was {{emblematic of}} the age of ICT. But we must {{understand}} that it was a child of its age. Nokia went surfing on the fifth <b>Kondratieff</b> <b>wave</b> and showed its power, because the ICT applications greatly increased the productivity of the economic and social system. Once again we see how a specific innovation solved certain key questions relating {{to the development of the}} previous waves, simultaneously creating challenges for future waves. Moreover, Nokia developed a highly distinctive culture of leadership (see the following chapter). The global redistribution of production capacity and excess supply are among the factors inherited from the fifth <b>Kondratieff</b> <b>wave,</b> just when the new wave begins to develop its own characteristic drivers.

40|$|The article {{presents}} results of spectral analysis that has detected {{the presence of}} Kondratieff waves (their period equals approximately 52 – 53 years) in the world GDP dynamics for the 1870 – 2007 period. To estimate the statistical significance of the detected cycles a new methodology has been applied. The significance of K-waves in the analyzed data {{has turned out to}} be in the range between 4 and 5 per cent. Hence, this spectral analysis has supported the hypothesis of the presence of Kondratieff waves in the world GDP dynamics. In addition, the reduced spectra analysis has indicated a rather high (2 – 3 %) significance of Juglar cycles (with a period of 7 – 9 years), as well as the one of Kitchin cycles (with a period of 3 – 4 years). Thus our spectral analysis has also supported the hypothesis of the presence of Juglar and Kitchin cycles in the world GDP dynamics. On the other hand, our analysis suggests that the Kuznets swing should be regarded as the third harmonic of the <b>Kondratieff</b> <b>wave</b> rather than as a separate independent cycle. This research suggests two interpretations of the current global economic crisis. On the one hand, the spectral analysis suggests rather optimistically that the current world economic crisis might mark not the beginning of the downswing phase of the 5 th <b>Kondratieff</b> <b>wave,</b> but it may be interpreted as a temporary depression between two peaks of the upswing (whereas the next peak might even exceed the previous one). On the other hand, there also seems to be some evidence supporting another interpretation based on the assumption that the current world financial-economic crisis marks the beginning of the downswing phase of the 5 th <b>Kondratieff</b> <b>wave.</b> The article also explores the world GDP dynamics before 1870 and finds that it does not appear possible to detect Kondratieff waves in the world GDP dynamics for the pre- 1870 period, though for this period they appear to be detected for the GDP dynamics of the West. This suggests that in the pre- 1870 epoch the Modern World System was not sufficiently integrated, and the World System core was not sufficiently strong yet – that is why the rhythm of the Western core’s development was not quite felt on the world level. Only in the subsequent era the World System reached such a level of integration and its core acquired such strength that it appears possible to trace quite securely Kondratieff waves in the World GDP dynamics...|$|E
30|$|Within the long-wave theory framework, our {{observations}} {{fit into}} the general pattern of organisational change following and accompanying societal level changes, as the system reorganises following {{the emergence of new}} economic drivers. These observations coincide well with some of the earlier studies on the relationship between the long socio-economic cycles and the changes and demands on organisational life. Indeed, using the <b>Kondratieff</b> <b>wave</b> theory as a larger framework to understand the various demands of leadership, and the change of preferred values, shows that the values on which people build their lives on have an ever stronger link to the engagement levels of people [40]. The emerging new model of organisational behaviour suggested by Laloux [28] fits well into this larger framework of societal change.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{some special}} {{characteristics of the}} current recession. First, {{it began as a}} crisis of debt and of asset price inflation.

Forth, it represents a collapse of demand and, following from that rising unemployment. Finally, the rising unemployment exacerbates the debt crisis. This completes a vicious cycle.

The third wave saw the electrification of the world and the spread of chemicals in agriculture, speeding up innovation also in medicine. This wave came to an end with the great depression at the turn of the 1920 s and 1930 s. All these waves have been characterized by the leadership models, where there has been a huge difference between managers and workers in terms of their position to influence. Without too much of exaggeration, we might argue that workers more or less were possessed by the owners and they had very little to say about how their work should be conducted.|$|E

In-between is an "artificial" layer protected by the international regulatory framework. This layer has characteristics of both the "cream" and "cake" layers. On the one hand, the labor force in this layer suffers from low job mobility and low-paid blue-collar work of the "cake portion" and is dominated by female semi-skilled workers. On the other hand, industrialists and governments in this layer enjoy the profits and high export values of the "cream" portion.

40|$|The paper distinguishes four {{views on}} the impact of the financial-economic crisis on {{sustainability}} transitions (operationalized as diffusion of green niche-innovations). The first three views highlight the possibility of positive impacts of the financial-economic crisis on sustainability transitions and joint solutions: a) a comprehensive transformation of the capitalist system, b) a green Industrial Revolution, linked to a sixth green <b>Kondratieff</b> <b>wave,</b> c) green growth. The fourth view perceives the impact as mainly negative, because the financialeconomic crisis weakens public, political and business attention for environmental problems.

This emerging new wave of development calls for intelligent use of resources. Leading the human capital of the organization will become a key challenge for the companies as the shift in values demands more attention to the needs of employees. As a result, three key leadership themes are rising: first, how to build a vision that motivates people over profitmaking for the shareholders. Second, how to align business ends with social ends. And third, how to build a learning organization where the usual silos are being torn down.

When educational developments in the United States between 1790 and 1980 are analyzed in terms of Nikolai D. <b>Kondratieff's</b> <b>wave</b> theory of economic development, it is evident that the nation's educational system at all levels, public and private, has been significantly shaped by cyclical pressures and characterized by clear periods of contraction and expansion lasting approximately half a century. The educational developments analyzed in the study include changes in the continuum of public education, size of schools and school districts, length of public school calendar years, development of educational standards, extension of federally guaranteed liberties, relationships between church and state, attention to gender and racial diversity, and economic support for education at all levels and in all governmental agencies. To a considerable degree, the analysis indicates that, when applied to major developments in education, <b>Kondratieff's</b> <b>wave</b> theory has important predictive ability. In addition, the analysis indicates that two broad themes run through nearly all of the selected topics: a tendency toward centralization and the evolution of opposing climates. The combined effects of an accumulative growth of centralized authority at state and federal levels combined with increasing demands for demonstrable standards in education emerge as a cyclical phenomenon that is predicted to result in the equivalent of a national ministry of education in the United States by the year 2030. During the same 50 years between now and 2030, the current climate of economic contraction, which is characterized by conservative thought and increased attention to state and local prerogatives, will evolve first, into a climate of economic expansion, which will be characterized by more liberal thought and increased attention to national priorities, and then once again into a climate of economic contraction not dissimilar from that of today...|$|R

This trend is viewed {{as part of the}} process of transition from the modern (Third) to the post-modern (Fourth) epoch. Within this environment, non-state entities utilize asymmetric warfare against nation-states. The most dangerous of these opponents are those whose approach is asymmetric by nature (due to their network-type organization) and who thereby represent a direct challenger to the nation-state form. Al Qaeda fits both of these conditions and enough is known about its operations and structure to allow its asymmetric warfare components— based on its space-time, matter-energy, and doctrinal-organizational elements— to be analyzed. Findings indicate that Al Qaeda has a clear advantage with regard to the space-time and organizational-doctrinal components of warfare. It is currently deficient in the matter-energy component but it is projected that it (or its descendent form) will eventually obtain directed energy weapons.
