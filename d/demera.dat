5000|$|The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church {{also claims}} {{to have the right}} wing of the true cross buried in the monastery of Gishen Mariam. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church has an annual {{religious}} holiday, called Meskel or <b>Demera,</b> commemorating the discovery of the True Cross by Queen Helena. Meskel occurs on 17 Meskerem in the Ethiopian calendar (September 27, Gregorian calendar, or September 28 in leap years). [...] "Meskel" [...] (or [...] "Meskal" [...] or [...] "Mesqel", there are various ways to transliterate from Ge'ez to Latin script) is Ge'ez for [...] "cross".|$|E
5000|$|The Meskel celebration {{includes}} {{the burning of}} a large bonfire, or <b>Demera,</b> {{based on the belief}} that Queen Eleni, as she is known, had a revelation in a dream. She was told that she should make a bonfire and that the smoke would show her where the true cross was buried. So she ordered the people of Jerusalem to bring wood and make a huge pile. After adding frankincense to it the bonfire was lit and the smoke rose high up to the sky and returned to the ground, exactly to the spot where the Cross had been buried.|$|E
5000|$|Thousands {{gather at}} the Square {{annually}} on 17 Meskerem in the Ethiopian calendar (September 27 in the Gregorian calendar), with celebrations in Addis Ababa {{beginning in the early}} afternoon when a procession bearing flaming torches approaches Meskel Square from various directions. A burning pyramid (<b>demera)</b> is located in the center and is circled by priests in brightly colored cloaks, students, brass bands, and the army carrying around giant crosses and torches. They set the pyramid alight with their torches, and the burning pyramid is kept ablaze until dawn until the celebrations through the night have ended.|$|E
50|$|Epimachus {{was born}} in Pelusium, {{and worked as a}} weaver along with his two companions: Theodore and Callinicos. At age 27, he heard that Youlamis the {{governor}} of Egypt was torturing the Christians. He subsequently went to El-Bakroug, (near <b>Demera)</b> and came before the governor, confessing his Christianity. Youlamis the governor tortured him severely, then ordered him to be squeezed on the wheel. A drop of his blood splashed on the eyes of a blind maiden, and she was able to see instantenously. The maiden and her family converted to Christianity and were martyred by Youlamis. Furious, the governor ordered Epimachus to be crucified and his head to be cut off. The executioner drew his sword but his strength failed. The same thing happened with another executioner, and so with fourteen others. When they failed to cut off his head, they tied a rope around his neck and dragged him until he died.|$|E
5000|$|According {{to local}} traditions, this Demera-procession {{takes place in}} the early evening the day before Meskel or on the day itself. The {{firewood}} is decorated with daisies prior to the celebration. Charcoal from the remains of the fire is afterwards collected and used by the faithful to mark their foreheads with the shape of a cross (compare Ash Wednesday). Edward Ullendorff records a number of beliefs of the meaning of <b>Demera,</b> with some believing that it [...] "marks the ultimate act in the cancellation of sins, while others hold that the direction of the smoke and the final collapse of the heap indicate the course of future events - just as the cloud of smoke the Lord raised over the Tabernacle offered guidance to the children of Israel (Exod. 40:34-38)."One explanation for the high rank this festival has in the church calendar is that it is believed that a part of the true Cross has been brought to Ethiopia from Egypt. It is said to be kept at Amba Geshen, which itself has a cross-shaped plan.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{after their}} recent defeat, the Moamorias and the Kacharis started to regroup their forces within Kachari Kingdom. Anticipating trouble, Kamaleswar Singha, with the {{consultation}} of Prime Minister Purnananda Burhagohain, sent Haripad Dekaphukan, a veteran army commander, to the Moamoria-Kachari war in Nagaon with five companies of sepoys. The King also commanded {{the transfer of}} a portion of army stationed at Guwahati to the main theatre of war. Haripad Dekaphukan proceeded down by land and water and joined Chandra Gohain, the Captain and Bacha Rajkhowa at Roha-Chowki. Meanwhile, the Raja of Darrang came with two thousand soldiers, while Lakshmi Narayan Brahmachari, the Duariya Barua of Hadirachowki also came to the battle scene with five companies of soldiers. The newly arrived reinforcements were halted at Jagi-chowki in present-day Marigaon District. After making elaborate planning and preparation, Haripad Dekaphukan decided to conduct operations against the Moamorias and the Kacharis. Meanwhile, the Kacharis and the Moamorias burnt down peaceful villages {{on the banks of}} Kapili river. Haripad Dekaphukan set up his headquarters at Narikalguri and Chang-chowki and successfully suppressed the insurrection in those regions. But the rebels again appeared at Bebejia and Khagarijan. They were aided by Lalungs or Tiwa community people and local militia. The Bacha Rajkhowa marched against the rebel and halted at Birah-Bebejia. The rebels burned down the villages of Pathari, Potani-sija and Bheleuguri. Haripad Dekaphukan immediately came to the scene of battle and successfully chased the rebels from the regions. The Ahom army marched to Tetelikhana and afterward to Dabaka, from whence they proceeded to a fort {{on the bank of the}} Jamuna river. Meanwhile, the combine force of Moamorias and the Kacharis had advanced from Barthal to the village <b>Demera.</b> A quarrel then ensued between the Moamorias and the Kacharis, and some of the Kacharis abandoned the rank of Moamorias and offered their submission to the Ahom forces. Haripad Dekaphukan seized this opportunity, and escorted the Kacharis to Birah-Bebejia near the Kalang river where they were properly established. Haripad Dekaphukan started chasing the enemy force to permanently crush their resistance, however the enemy avoided to give any battle to the royal force. This hide and seek game continued for days, until one day, the royal forces unexpectedly came in face-to-face to combine force of Moamorias and Kacharis at the mouth of the Kalang river. There ensued a fierce battle between both sides, in which the combine force of Moamoria and Kacharis was decisively defeated. Many enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, while a large number of them were taken prisoner. Some of them again fled to the territories of Kachari Kingdom. This time, Haripad Dekaphukan chased the fugitives and entered into the territory of Kachari Kingdom. He captured a large number of Moamoria rebels, Kachari people and Assamese refugee, who fled the Ahom Kingdom during Moamoria rebellion and later settled them in Nagaon District. He also captured four Chieftains or Raja Powalis of Tiwa or Lalung community who were helping the Moamoria rebels and later put them to death along with other rebel leaders. Barmura Gohain, the Ahom prince who collaborates with the Moamoria rebels fled to Bengal, while other Moamoria leaders fled to Khaspur and Jaintiapur. Thus, the Kachari-Moamoria war in Nagaon came to an end in 1805 CE. During that time, Haripad Dekaphukan got news from his family in Jorhat that his wife gave birth to a son. Delighted, by this news and also with a desire to commemorate his victory in Kachari-Moamoria war, Haripad Dekaphukan, named his son as Ranonjoy, which literally mean victor of battles.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{concentration}} of heavy metals {{in drinking water}} is very important. Objectives: To to evaluate the chemistry of some heavy metals in surface drinking water of Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt. Methods: 51 surface drinking water samples were collected from the main surface water stations and compact units in October 2009 and analyzed chemically. 26 water samples were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer for iron, manganese, lead, nickel, chromium, zinc, copper, cobalt, aluminum, and cadmium concentrations. Results: Aluminum concentration was slightly high in water sample of Bosat network. Cadmium concentration in samples of up-streams of shark and Mit-Khamis stations, networks of Mit-Antar, <b>Demera,</b> Bosat, Bilqas, El-satamony, El-Gamalia, Mit-asim and Bilqas station exceeded the permissible limits of Egyptian Ministry of Health (EMH, 2007) and World Health Organization (WHO, 2008). The nickel concentration in the network samples taken from Shoha, Bosat and El-Gamalia as well as up-stream of Bosat station exceeded the permissible limits. Also, lead concentrations of the network samples of Shoha, Mit-Antar, <b>Demera</b> and Nabaru exceeded the permissible limits. Conclusion: Regular chemical analysis of surface drinking water is required. Since these heavy metals are most likely originate from steel, plastics and batteries industries working in the region, we believe that activities of these industries must be stopped or at least limited in urban zones. </p...|$|E
