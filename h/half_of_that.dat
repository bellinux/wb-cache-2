Here it meets the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10) and Chino Valley Freeway (SR 71) at the four-level Kellogg Hill Interchange.

5|$|Capital {{and energy}} of urban enterprisers {{affected}} {{the development of}} mining and metallurgy during the earlier Commonwealth period. There were several hundred hammersmith shops {{at the turn of}} the 17th century. Great ironworks furnaces were built in the first <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> century. Mining and metallurgy of silver, copper and lead had also been developed. Expansion of salt production was taking place in Wieliczka, Bochnia and elsewhere. After about 1700 some of the industrial enterprises were increasingly being taken over by land owners who used serf labor, which led to their neglect and decline in the second half of the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named after the Hawaiian volcanoes with which this eruptive type is hallmark. Hawaiian eruptions are the calmest types {{of volcanic}} events, characterized by the effusive eruption of very fluid basalt-type lavas with low gaseous content. The volume of ejected material from Hawaiian eruptions is less than <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> found in other eruptive types. Steady production of small amounts of lava builds up the large, broad form of a shield volcano. Eruptions are not centralized at the main summit as with other volcanic types, and often occur at vents around the summit and from fissure vents radiating out of the center.|$|E

5|$|The Przeworsk culture, {{named after}} a town in Lesser Poland, near which another burial ground was found, {{originated}} like the Oksywie culture around 250 BC, but lasted a long time. In its course it went through many changes, formed tribal and political structures, fought wars, also with the Romans, until in the 5th century AD its highly developed society of farmers, artisans, warriors and chiefs left for the temptations of the fallen empire lands (for many of them it happened possibly rather quickly, during the first <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> century).|$|E

The existence of lightning had been controversial outside of the former Soviet Union since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes. However, in 2006–2007 Venus Express was reported to detect whistler mode waves, which were attributed to lightning. Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity. The lightning rate is at least <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{clouds of}} Venus may {{be capable of}} {{producing}} lightning. The existence of lightning in the atmosphere of Venus has been controversial since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes. In 2006–07, Venus Express clearly detected whistler mode waves, the signatures of lightning. Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity. According to these measurements, the lightning rate is at least <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> on Earth.

BioWare announced that the game would be released on October 20, 2009, but pushed it back again to November 6, 2009, as the team wanted additional time to finalize some last-minute decisions.

5|$|The {{steam turbine}} {{section of a}} power plant, the turbine hall, {{generally}} costs about $1/W, and the electrical equipment to feed that power to the grid is about another $1/W. To reach the projected total CAPEX quoted in LIFE documents, this implies that the entire nuclear island has to cost around $4/W for LIFE.2, and just over $2/W for LIFE.3. Modern nuclear plants, benefiting from decades of commercial experience and continuous design work, cost just under $8/W, with approximately <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> in the nuclear island.
