5|$|In 2013, Juniper {{introduced}} {{new line}} cards for the MX series {{and a new}} switch fabric module, intended to upgrade the MX series' for higher bandwidth needs and for software defined networking applications. The capacity of the MX240, 480 and 960 were increased by double or more. A new Multiservice Modular <b>Interface</b> <b>Card</b> (MS-MIC) was incorporated that supports up to 9 Gbit/s for services like tunneling software.|$|E
25|$|While the {{electrical}} interface and {{the format of}} the data transmitted by commonly available mice is currently standardized on USB, in the past it varied between different manufacturers. A bus mouse used a dedicated <b>interface</b> <b>card</b> for connection to an IBM PC or compatible computer.|$|E
25|$|Before launch, {{testing of}} the {{assembled}} spacecraft uncovered a potential data corruption problem with an <b>interface</b> <b>card</b> {{that was designed to}} route MARDI image data as well as data from various other parts of the spacecraft. The potential problem could occur if the <b>interface</b> <b>card</b> were to receive a MARDI picture during a critical phase of the spacecraft's final descent, at which point data from the spacecraft's Inertial Measurement Unit could have been lost; this data was critical to controlling the descent and landing. This was judged to be an unacceptable risk, and it was decided to not use MARDI during the mission. As the flaw was discovered too late for repairs, the camera remained installed on Phoenix but it was not used to take pictures, nor was its built-in microphone used.|$|E
5000|$|A WIC is {{inserted}} into a WIC (or HWIC, or EHWIC) expansion slot in a Cisco device. According to Cisco, [...] "Cisco <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> are classified {{according to the}} technologies they support. For example, WAN <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> (WICs) support WAN technologies, such as Gigabit Ethernet; and voice <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> (VICs) support voice technologies. Voice/WAN <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> (VWICs) can support voice, data, and voice and data applications, depending on {{the capabilities of the}} router in which the VWIC is installed." [...] The WIC is supported by many Cisco devices, particularly their branch routers including the 2500 series routers and its successors.|$|R
50|$|Bandwidth pooling {{is used in}} network {{switches}} to optimize the use of network resources. It allows switch processing cards to be shared by physical <b>interface</b> <b>cards.</b> This innovation frees switch resources {{that would otherwise be}} stranded when lower-rate <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> are deployed in an aggregation switch.|$|R
50|$|Type-III PC Card {{devices are}} 16-bit or 32-bit. These cards are 10.5 mm thick, {{allowing}} them to accommodate devices with components that would not fit type I or type II height. Examples are hard disk drive <b>cards,</b> and <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> with full-size connectors {{that do not require}} dongles (as is commonly required with type II <b>interface</b> <b>cards).</b>|$|R
25|$|Many 64-bit PCI-X {{cards are}} {{designed}} to work in 32-bit mode if inserted in shorter 32-bit connectors, with some loss of performance. An {{example of this is}} the Adaptec 29160 64-bit SCSI <b>interface</b> <b>card.</b> However, some 64-bit PCI-X cards do not work in standard 32-bit PCI slots.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{original}} Apple Mouse IIc was compatible across all platforms, Apple renamed the mouse in 1985 and offered {{it as an}} optional purchase for all computers and separate from the Apple II <b>interface</b> <b>card.</b> It featured an updated mechanism and the new uniform rounded cable connector. Apple would briefly reuse this name later for a re-badged Apple Pro Mouse.|$|E
2500|$|Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE), later {{standardized}} {{under the}} name AT Attachment (ATA, with the alias P-ATA or PATA (Parallel ATA) retroactively added upon introduction of SATA) moved the HDD controller from the <b>interface</b> <b>card</b> to the disk drive. This helped to standardize the host/controller interface, reduce the programming complexity in the host device driver, and reduced system cost and complexity. The 40-pin IDE/ATA connection transfers 16bits of data at a time on the data cable. The data cable was originally 40-conductor, but later higher speed requirements for data transfer {{to and from the}} HDD led to an [...] "ultra DMA" [...] mode, known as UDMA. Progressively swifter versions of this standard ultimately added the requirement for an 80-conductor variant of the same cable, where half of the conductors provides grounding necessary for enhanced high-speed signal quality by reducing cross talk.|$|E

2500|$|The Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) was {{introduced}} {{as part of}} the Wired for Management framework by Intel and is described in the specification published by Intel and SystemSoft. PXE version 2.0 was released in December 1998, and the update 2.1 was made public in September 1999. The PXE environment makes use of several standard client‑server protocols like DHCP and TFTP (now defined by the 1992 published RFC 1350). Within the PXE schema the client [...] side of the provisioning equation is now {{an integral part of the}} PXE standard and it is implemented either as a Network <b>Interface</b> <b>Card</b> (NIC) BIOS extension or today in modern devices as UEFI code. This distinctive firmware layer makes available at the client the functions of a basic Universal Network Driver Interface (UNDI), a minimalistic UDP/IP stack, a Preboot (DHCP) client module and a TFTP client module, together forming the PXE application programming interfaces (APIs) used by the NBP when needing to interact with the services offered by the server counterpart of the PXE environment. TFTP's low throughput, especially when used over high-latency links, has been initially mitigated by the TFTP Blocksize Option RFC 2348 published in May 1998, and later by the TFTP Windowsize Option RFC 7440 published in January 2015.|$|E
