40|$|Yahoo! was in {{the late}} nineties the most {{profitable}} and successful internet company on the web. However, after the burst of the dotcom bubble, its competitive position changed dramatically as the banner advertising format, the center of its advertising-based business model, entered in decline. This dissertation uses dynamic capabilities to explain the failure of Yahoo! {{to respond to that}} change in the environment. For that purpose, we develop and analyze in detail a teaching case covering Yahoo!’s history from 1994 to 2007. As we succeed to explain the failure of Yahoo! as caused by a low level of dynamic capabilities, we conclude that the company had a low propensity to sense opportunities and threats, to make timely decisions and to make market-oriented decisions. We further identify problems in Yahoo!’s propensity to change its resource base that we classify as medium-low. Its low level of dynamic capabilities led Yahoo! to ignore the potential of search as a business and the emergence of <b>keywords</b> <b>advertising</b> as the dominant format of online advertising. Yahoo! reacted late and failed to transform its resource base in an effective manner to respond to those changes. These events still impact Yahoo!’s performance today...|$|R

50|$|<b>Keyword</b> <b>{{advertising}}</b> {{is a form}} {{of online}} advertising in which an advertiser pays to have an advertisement appear in the results listing when a person uses a particular phrase to search the Web, typically by employing a search engine. The particular phrase is composed of one or more keyterms that is linked to one or more advertisements.

50|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{trademark}} infringement cases brought by brand owners and companies concerned with how other keyword advertisers used their trademarks or brands in pay-per click or <b>keyword</b> <b>advertising.</b> Courts in the U.S. and around the world have been slow to issue clear guidance on the issue of whether use of trademarks as keywords constitutes trademark infringement. This lack of guidance, however, may be partially due to the fact that the majority of <b>keyword</b> <b>advertising</b> cases are settled out of court and do not proceed to trial. This leaves courts unable to make legal decisions on issues brought in these cases. As a result, there are still many unanswered questions on the issue of whether the sale or purchase and use of a trademark as a keyword to trigger Internet advertisements is trademark infringement.|$|E

In 1996, Chip Royce, head of online marketing for InterZine Productions of Boca Raton, Florida, approached Yahoo!'s sales agent (Flycast Communications) suggesting ads around keyword results to provide a more effective, targeted advertising within Yahoo!'s search results.
