30|$|In network coding, {{its very}} nature of {{combining}} information in the intermediate nodes makes it very susceptible to transmission errors.

40|$|Abstract—With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of the Internet, there is increasing interest in using it for audio and video transmission. Perceptual studies of audio and video viewing have shown that viewers find bursty losses, mostly caused by congestion, to be the most annoying disturbance, and hence these are critical issues to be addressed for continuous media streaming applications. Classical error handling techniques have mostly been geared toward ensuring that the transmission is correct, with no attention to timeliness. For isochronous traffic like audio and video, timeliness is a key criterion, and given the high degree of content redundancy, some loss of content is quite acceptable. In this paper, we introduce the concept of <b>error</b> <b>spreading,</b> which is a transformation technique that permutes the input sequence of packets (from a continuous stream of data) before transmission. The packets are unscrambled at the receiving end. The transformation is designed to ensure that bursty losses in the transformed domain get spread all over the sequence in the original domain, thus improving the perceptual quality of the stream. Our <b>error</b> <b>spreading</b> idea deals with both cases where the stream has or does not have inter-frame dependencies. We next describe a continuous media transmission protocol and experimentally validate its performance based on this idea. We also show that our protocol can be used complementary to other error handling protocols. Index Terms—Bursty <b>error,</b> <b>error</b> <b>spreading,</b> multimedia. I...|$|R

30|$|We {{propose a}} new {{framework}} about the network error correction coding in random network coding. The scheme introduces {{the combination of}} L 1 optimization method and list decoding to correct the propagated dense error in the random network coding. This method overcomes the shortcoming that the traditional block codes can correct corrupted errors no more than C/ 2 in random network coding. The experiments show our scheme can solve the <b>error</b> <b>spread</b> problem in random network coding. The rank code or the subspace code are the best cure methods to solve the <b>error</b> <b>spread</b> in the random network coding at present. Whether the rank code or the subspace code, they just can solve the <b>error</b> <b>spread</b> problem in the random network where the number of original error is less than C/ 2. Our scheme not only can correct the errors more than C/ 2 but also can correct errors which just pollute all the links. Although the information rate is low when the fraction of errors is near 100 %, the information rate is acceptable {{if there is a}} small penalty in the fraction of successful decoding. Our scheme is also efficient in time. The decoding time of L 1 optimization algorithm is no more than that of the decoding algorithm about the traditional block codes. Our scheme outperforms the existing network error correction coding schemes in random network coding. The scheme, which is the combination of L 1 optimization and list decoding, has great significance to applying the network coding theory to engineering practice.|$|E

40|$|Communication {{between a}} pair of nodes in the network may get {{disrupted}} due to failures of links/nodes resulting in zero effective bandwidth between them during the recovery period. It has been observed that such disruptions are not too uncommon and may last from tens of seconds to minutes.

40|$|For {{transmission}} of continuous media (CM) streams such as {{audio and video}} over the Internet, a critical issue is that periodic network overloads cause bursty packet losses. Studies on human perception of audio and video streams have shown that bursty losses have the most annoying affects. Hence, addressing this issue is critical for multimedia applications such as Internet phone, video conferencing, distance learning, etc. Classical error handling schemes like retransmission and forward error recovery have the undesirable effects of (a) introducing timing variations, which is unacceptable for isochronous traffic, and (b) using up valuable bandwidth, potentially exacerbating the problem. This paper introduces a new concept called <b>error</b> <b>spreading,</b> which is a transformation technique that takes an input sequence of packets (from an audio or video stream) and permutes them before transmission. The packets are then un-permuted at the receiver before delivery to the application. The purpose is to spread out bursty network errors, {{in order to achieve}} better perceptual quality of the transmitted stream. Analysis has been done to determine the provable lower bound on bursty errors tolerable by this class of protocols. An algorithm to generate the optimal permutation for a given network loss rate is presented. While our previous work had focused on streams with no inter-frame dependencies, e. g. MJPEG encoded video, in this paper the technique is generalized to streams with inter-frame dependencies, e. g. MPEG encoded video. It is also shown how the <b>error</b> <b>spreading</b> approach {{can be used as a}} module to be plugged into any existing CM transmission protocol to help improve the perceptual quality of the data stream without changing the bandwidth requirement of the base protocol. Thus, this approach is orthogonal to traditional error handling techniques. Finally, results from an experimental evaluation are presented to validate our claims...|$|R
