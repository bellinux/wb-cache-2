25|$|The sample {{mixture to}} be {{separated}} and analyzed is introduced, in a discrete small volume (typically microliters), into the stream of mobile phase percolating through the column. The components of the sample move through the column at different velocities, which are a function of specific physical interactions with the adsorbent (also called stationary phase). The velocity of each component depends on its chemical nature, {{on the nature of}} the stationary phase (column) and on the composition of the mobile phase. The time at which a specific analyte <b>elutes</b> (emerges from the column) is called its retention time. The retention time measured under particular conditions is an identifying characteristic of a given analyte.|$|E
25|$|At the hospital, the 99mTc {{that forms}} through 99Mo decay is {{chemically}} {{extracted from the}} technetium-99m generator. Most commercial 99Mo/99mTc generators use column chromatography, in which 99Mo {{in the form of}} water-soluble molybdate, MoO42− is adsorbed onto acid alumina (Al2O3). When the 99Mo decays, it forms pertechnetate TcO4−, which, because of its single charge, is less tightly bound to the alumina. Pulling normal saline solution through the column of immobilized 99MoO42− <b>elutes</b> the soluble 99mTcO4−, resulting in a saline solution containing the 99mTc as the dissolved sodium salt of the pertechnetate. One technetium-99m generator, holding only a few micrograms of 99Mo, can potentially diagnose 10,000 patients because it will be producing 99mTc strongly for over a week.|$|E

[...] HPLC is used for nonvolatile mixtures that would not be suitable for gas chromatography. [...] This is useful in drug analysis where the pharmaceutical is a combination drug since the components would separate, or elute, at different times allowing for the verification of each component. [...] The eluates from the HPLC column are then fed into various detectors that produce a peak on a graph relative to its concentration as it <b>elutes</b> off the column.

50|$|One {{requirement}} for SEC {{is that the}} analyte does not interact with {{the surface of the}} stationary phases, with differences in elution time between analytes ideally being based solely on the solute volume the analytes can enter, rather than chemical or electrostatic interactions with the stationary phases. Thus, a small molecule that can penetrate every region of the stationary phase pore system can enter a total volume equal to the sum of the entire pore volume and the interparticle volume. This small molecule <b>elutes</b> late (after the molecule has penetrated all of the pore- and interparticle volume—approximately 80% of the column volume). At the other extreme, a very large molecule that cannot penetrate any the smaller pores can enter only the interparticle volume (~35% of the column volume) and <b>elutes</b> earlier when this volume of mobile phase has passed through the column. The underlying principle of SEC is that particles of different sizes elute (filter) through a stationary phase at different rates. This results in the separation of a solution of particles based on size. Provided that all the particles are loaded simultaneously or near-simultaneously, particles of the same size should elute together.|$|E
