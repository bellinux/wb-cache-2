5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman {{can be kept}} as a pet, though {{providing}} suitable care is <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> requires extremely large enclosures. In many countries, permits or licenses {{are necessary}} and most veterinarians have little experience of these exotic animals.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the East German {{leadership}} considered {{proposals to}} replace the <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> intrusive fortifications with a high-technology system codenamed Grenze 2000. Drawing on technology used by the Soviet Army during the Soviet–Afghan War, it would have replaced the fences with sensors and detectors. However, the plan was never implemented.|$|E
5|$|Like palladium, {{powdered}} osmium effectively absorbs hydrogen atoms. This {{could make}} osmium a potential {{candidate for a}} metal-hydride battery electrode. However, osmium is <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> would react with potassium hydroxide, the most common battery electrolyte.|$|E

5|$|Pensford Colliery, {{which opened}} in 1909, had the latest {{equipment}} at the time including coal cutters. It had a red brick winding house, pithead baths and a coal washery. Faulting made coal production <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> it closed in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} in {{the city}} consists primarily of a First West of England bus network. Other providers are Abus, Stagecoach West, Stagecoach South West and Wessex Bus. Bristol's bus service has been criticised as unreliable and <b>expensive,</b> <b>and</b> in 2005 FirstGroup was fined for delays and safety violations.|$|E
5|$|Quinine wouldn't be {{successfully}} synthesized until 1918. Synthesis remains elaborate, <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> low yield, {{with the additional}} problem of separation of the stereoisomers. Though quinine {{is not one of}} the major drugs used in treatment, modern production still relies on extraction from the cinchona tree.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} gaseous or highly {{volatile}} brominated halomethane compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> their production and use {{has been greatly}} curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include bromochloromethane (Halon 1011, CH2BrCl), bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon 1211, CBrClF2), and bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301, CBrF3).|$|E
5|$|ACC teams viewed a {{berth in}} the Humanitarian Bowl as {{undesirable}} due to its location. Aside from {{being one of the}} lower priority tie-ins, the destination is far outside the conference's geographic footprint. Travel costs from the East Coast are prohibitively <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> historically caused low turnout among ACC fans. In addition, the game is hosted at a cold-weather venue, which is a disadvantage in comparison with ACC bowl games in places such as Florida, California, and Georgia.|$|E

50|$|It is {{believed}} that site monitoring costs account for about 20% of the clinical trial budget. Site monitoring involves among other things, 100% source data verification. This is a very exhaustive <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> process <b>and</b> often prone to errors resulting in FDA citations.|$|R
5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> could not be built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the cities}} {{that have been}} {{proposed}} to house {{the headquarters of the}} United Nations are Saint Petersburg, Montreal, Dubai, Jerusalem, and Nairobi. Critics of the relocation say that the idea would be <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> would also involve the withdrawal of the United States from the organization, and with it much of the agency's funding. They also state that the proposals have never gone from being mere declarations.|$|E
5|$|As his father's second son, Alexander {{was third}} {{in line to}} the throne, after his father and elder brother, George. His {{education}} was <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> carefully planned, but while George spent part of his military training in Germany, Alexander was educated in Greece. He joined the prestigious Hellenic Military Academy, where several of his uncles had previously studied and where he made himself known more for his mechanical skills than for his intellectual capacity. He was passionate about cars and motors, {{and was one of}} the first Greeks to acquire an automobile.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the Bessemer process and other modern production techniques, steel was <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> was only used where no cheaper alternative existed, particularly for the cutting edge of knives, razors, swords, and other items where a hard, sharp edge was needed. It was also used for springs, including those used in clocks and watches.|$|E
5|$|Bosi had {{previously}} been head chef and won a Michelin star at the Overton Grange restaurant, just outside the town. He had intended to open a restaurant in Warwickshire, but found the premises too <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> purchased a 25-year lease on the former Oaks property in Ludlow for £40,000. Within a year Hibiscus won its first Michelin star, {{and at the same}} time Overton Grange was downgraded before going into receivership.|$|E
5|$|Building a full spliced blank {{from scratch}} was an <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> {{painstaking}} process, {{and the large}} manufacturing facilities of Brunswick turned out good quality blanks, with beautiful points, veneers and sound construction. In Balabushka's case, his entire workshop consisted of a single lathe and other woodworking equipment {{in the confines of}} his modest garage, and building his own full-splice butts would have been prohibitively difficult and expensive for him.|$|E
