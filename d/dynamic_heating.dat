Under <b>dynamic</b> <b>heating,</b> the lac dye started to degrade at temperatures higher than 150  °C which mainly involved the thermo-oxidative reaction at carboxylic groups in conjugation with the C=C bonds of the anthraquinone ring. Before and after <b>dynamic</b> <b>heating</b> to 60 – 150  °C, the absorbance profiles of each lac dye solution {{were not significantly}} different. Under heating the lac dye to higher temperatures, the absorbance significantly dropped resulting from the degradation of the chromophores. Under long weathering period, the chemical change mainly involved O–H bonds of hydroxyl and carboxylic groups. This change also strongly lowered the absorbability of lac dye solution. The obtained results provided helpful information about thermo-oxidative and weathering stability of lac dye which is useful for maintenance, preparation, dyeing process and realistic applications.|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} an effective intelligent model {{to predict the}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>heat</b> supply of heat source. A hybrid forecasting method was proposed based on support vector regression (SVR) model-optimized particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. Due to the interaction of meteorological conditions and the heating parameters of heating system, {{it is extremely difficult}} to forecast <b>dynamic</b> <b>heat</b> supply. Firstly, the correlations among heat supply and related influencing factors in the heating system were analyzed through the correlation analysis of statistical theory. Then, the SVR model was employed to forecast <b>dynamic</b> <b>heat</b> supply. In the model, the input variables were selected based on the correlation analysis and three crucial parameters, including the penalties factor, gamma of the kernel RBF, and insensitive loss function, were optimized by PSO algorithms. The optimized SVR model was compared with the basic SVR, optimized genetic algorithm-SVR (GA-SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN) through six groups of experiment data from two heat sources. The results of the correlation coefficient analysis revealed the relationship between the influencing factors and the forecasted heat supply and determined the input variables. The performance of the PSO-SVR model is superior to those of the other three models. The PSO-SVR method is statistically robust and can be applied to practical heating system...|$|R

40|$|A modern {{gas turbine}} engine (GTE) is a complex {{nonlinear}} dynamic system with the mutual effect of gas-dynamic and thermal processes in its components. The engine devel-opment requires the precise real-time simulation of all main operating modes. One {{of the most complex}} operating modes for modeling is “cold stabilization, ” which is the rotors acceleration without completely heated up the turbine elements. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>heating</b> problem is a topical practical issue. Solving the problem requires coordinating a gas-path model with heat and stress models, which is also a significant scientific problem. The phenomenon of interest is the radial clearances change during engines operation and its influence on engines static and dynamic performances. To consider the clearance change, it is necessary to synthesize the quick proceeding stress-state models (QPSSM) of a rotor and a casing for the initial temperature and <b>dynamic</b> <b>heating.</b> The unique fea-ture of the QPSSM of GTEs is separate equation sets, which allow the heat exchange between structure elements and the gas (air) and the displacements of the turbine rotor and the casing.

We have applied these methods to the east model (a variation of the Ising model for glass forming systems) and a simple polymeric system via molecular dynamics simulation, and our results match what is seen in experiment. For the east model, since the dynamics are so simple, a mathematical model is developed that matches the simulated dynamics. For the polymeric system, since the system is a simulation, we can instantaneously 'quench' the system - removing all vibrational energy - to separate the vibrational dynamics from dynamics associated with particle rearrangements. This shows that the long-time glassy dynamics are due entirely to the particle rearrangements, i. e. basin jumping on the potential energy landscape.

40|$|El Niño events (warm) {{are often}} {{stronger}} than La Niña events (cold). This asymmetry is an intrinsic nonlinear {{characteristic of the}} El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. In order to measure the nonlinearity of ENSO, the maximum potential intensity (MPI) index and the nonlinear <b>dynamic</b> <b>heating</b> (NDH) of ENSO are proposed as qualitative and quantitative measures. The 1997 / 98 El Niño that was recorded as the strongest event {{in the past century}} and another strong El Niño event in 1982 / 83 nearly reached the MPI. During these superwarming events, the normal climatological conditions of the ocean and atmosphere were collapsed completely. The huge bursts of ENSO activity manifested in these events are attributable to the nonlinear dynamic processes. Through a heat budget analysis of the ocean mixed layer it is found that throughout much of the ENSO episodes of 1982 / 83 and 1997 / 98, the NDH strengthened these warm events and weakened subsequent La Niña events. This led to the warm–cold asymmetry. It is also found that the eastward-propagating feature in these two El Niño events provided a favorable phase relationship between temperature and current that resulted in the strong nonlinear dynamical warming. For the westward-propagating El Niño events prior to the late 1970 s (e. g., 1957 / 58 and 1972 / 73 ENSOs) the phase relationships between zonal temperature gradient and current and between the surface and subsurface temperature anomalies are unfavorable for nonlinear <b>dynamic</b> <b>heating,</b> and thereby the ENSO events are not strong. 1...|$|E

Another model is applied where the overall relaxation is made up of the relaxations of subdomains that each have their own characteristic times. Using Markov Chains, these times are computed numerically and symbolically, and the model is seen to match the simulations for low temperatures and high frequencies. The dynamics of the east model are tracked very well by this procedure, and we compare this to the parameters of the stretched exponential fits showing that a discrete number of relaxation times can give rise to stretched exponential like behavior.
