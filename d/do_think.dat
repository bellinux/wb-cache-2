5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we <b>do,</b> <b>think,</b> or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E
25|$|Despite expectations, {{prior to}} and during the season a total of sevenUT players were {{suspended}} for various infractions. Brown said “I am extremely disappointed that four of our student-athletes have had issues with the law this summer. That is not reflective of the high standard of class, character and integrity we have established at Texas for many years. It’s a shame that these recent events have generated {{a great deal of}} negative attention, because I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that overall, this is as good of a group of kids that I’ve ever coached. I think that will show over time.” The negative publicity was more extensive than in past instances but Mack Brown publicly supported the players while denouncing their actions.|$|E
500|$|Lin {{has turned}} down {{most of the}} {{sponsorship}} deals he has been offered. He stated that he declined {{tens of millions of}} dollars of endorsement opportunities during the peak of Linsanity. [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> my purpose is to play basketball, play well, and play for the glory of God," [...] he said. Lin called business outside of basketball [...] "definitely secondary to my primary job".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well! I <b>did</b> <b>think</b> {{that you}} {{was a gentleman}} that would not go back from your word. I <b>did</b> <b>think</b> that. I <b>did</b> <b>think</b> that you would never put a young lady to the {{necessity}} of bringing forward her own letters to prove {{that she is not}} expecting more than she has a right! You don't know! And that, after all that has been between us! John Eames!" [...] And again it seemed to him as though she were about to fly.|$|R

"I {{certainly}} <b>did</b> <b>think,</b> Mr. Philip," [...] {{said the}} gentleman alluded to, a very young-looking, apple-faced little man, with a timid manner, {{who stood in}} the background nervously rubbing his dry hands together--"I certainly <b>did</b> <b>think</b> that the squire looked aged when I saw him this morning." ...|$|R

500|$|Bruce Shapiro of Columbia University {{said that}} an engaged and empathetic {{reporter}} will {{be concerned about}} inflicting new trauma on the victim: [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that when the emotional valence of a story is this high, {{you really have to}} verify it." [...] He also explained that experienced reporters often work only with women who feel strong enough to deal with the due diligence required to bring the article to publication.|$|E
500|$|Marshall {{also cited}} [...] (1983), Zulu (1964), and works of {{director}} Terry Gilliam like The Fisher King (1991) as influences in producing Doomsday. Marshall acknowledged that his creation is [...] "so outrageous you've got to laugh". He reflected, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> it's going to divide audiences... I just {{want them to}} be thrilled and enthralled. I want them to be overwhelmed by the imagery they've seen. And go back and see it again." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard magazine, Elliott said, [...] "I really <b>do</b> <b>think</b> this is my best album. I was in a really great space with this album. I wasn't in a great space {{with some of the}} other albums I've done." [...] She went on to say, [...] "I played Lil' Kim the album the other day, and she told me it was incredible and that there was not one song on it that she didn't like." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I thought I {{might just}} try,' pursued he, disconsolately, 'whether she <b>did</b> <b>think</b> me any steadier. I hope she <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> me very troublesome. I {{tried not to}} harass her much.' ...|$|R
500|$|On December 11, 2007, {{four months}} after Jordan's death, it was {{announced}} that McDougal had chosen Brandon Sanderson to finish the final book in the series, although the decision itself had been made the preceding month. Sanderson had been chosen partly because McDougal had read and liked his novels, and partly because of a eulogy he had written for Jordan. McDougal later expanded on her reasons, saying, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> [...] has a natural feeling for the ethical and moral issues of life." ...|$|E
500|$|The type {{of letters}} written with {{a tone of}} incensed moral outrage have become {{commonly}} described as [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] letters, even though the writer may not be from Royal Tunbridge Wells. For example, actor Michael Caine once said: [...] "I don't want to sound like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, but I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> {{there should be some}} sort of national service for young men". People writing them have been claimed by commentators to be readers of the Daily Mail, despite the original letters not originating in that publication.|$|E
500|$|Artist Richard Chopping {{once again}} {{provided}} the cover art for the book. On 18 March 1959 Fleming {{had written to}} Chopping about the cover he had undertaken for Goldfinger, saying that: [...] "The new jacket is quite as big a success as the first one and I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> [...] Cape have made a splendid job of it". Moving on to For Your Eyes Only, Fleming said [...] "I am busily scratching my head {{trying to think of}} a subject for you again. No one in the history of thrillers has had such a totally brilliant artistic collaborator!" ...|$|E

500|$|On October 11, 2013, {{the band}} {{reportedly}} {{began working on}} their eighth studio album, Kintsugi, produced by Rich Costey. This was then confirmed by the group's official Instagram profile in which an image was uploaded with the caption [...] "DCFC LP8 begins". In an interview with Stereogum, Gibbard said of the new album, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> {{from start to finish}} it's a much better record than Codes And Keys. If that record turned anybody off, I feel pretty strongly that this one could win them back. There are threads in this one that connect back to our earliest stuff that people love." ...|$|E
500|$|CBC Sports head of {{programming}} Trevor Pilling {{explained that the}} large number of events being held, along with the stature of the Pan American Games in comparison to the Olympics, were a factor in the structure of CBC's coverage, stating that [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> we are the victim of our own success in that having Olympic coverage that is around the clock, but the Olympics are a different event than these Pan Am Games. But I feel like we've done the athletes justice by telling those stories or through live coverage, or with reporters on site. We've tried to make sure we're at all the significant events, and with Canada winning over 180 medals, that's a tall task." ...|$|E
500|$|New Line Cinema (one-time video {{distributor}} of the original) acquired {{the rights to}} the film from co-rights holder StudioCanal, who will control the European rights, and Carpenter, who will serve as an executive producer and said, [...] "Snake is one of my fondest creations. Kurt Russell did an incredible job, and {{it would be fun to}} see someone else try." [...] Russell has commented on the remake and on the casting of Butler as Plissken, saying, [...] "I will say that when I was told who was going to play Snake Plissken, my initial reaction was 'Oh, man!' [...] I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that character was quintessentially one thing. And that is, American." ...|$|E

500|$|Tessa {{is able to}} empathise with others, feel as they <b>do,</b> <b>think</b> as they do and so {{become like}} them. When MacLeod {{revealed}} his immortality to Tessa in [...] "Counterfeit Part Two", she can show compassion instead of the fear or disgust he expects: [...] "I was just thinking how lonely you must be. Your parents, your friends... having them all die." [...] Tessa is a very empathic and understanding character, for example, in [...] "Saving Grace", she is jealous of MacLeod's former lover Grace; however, when MacLeod assures her {{that he no longer}} loves Grace, her response is simply that [...] "...that's all that need to be said. She's your friend and she's been hurt. You'll help her. I'd expect you to do no less." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Who {{better to}} say those things don't matter than {{somebody}} who's experienced them? , 'How {{can you say}} they don't matter? How {{can you say that}} money won't bring you happiness if you don't have a lot of money? How can you say that fame and fortune are not a guarantee for happiness and joy and fulfillment in your life?' You have to have that experience to know. 'Cause you have all those things, I've had all those things, and I've had nothing but chaos around me. So I'm just sharing what I know with the world. 'Cause I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that we've become completely consumed with being rich and famous, our society has. And I just want to tell people, take it from me, I have all those things and none of them ever brought me one minute of happiness." ...|$|E
500|$|I've {{had this}} idea {{in my head}} for this show Tears of a Clown which is a {{combination}} of music and storytelling. Because {{at the end of the}} day I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> of myself as a story teller. But it's rough as f---, [...] so bear with me and give me all the support you can. It's from the heart. I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like I owe you a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer... If anyone thinks they came here to see a finished final show, there's the door. This is some brand spanking new shit. I don't know if you like it raw.|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} what critics called provocative {{statements}} and heresy from speakers. One example: Dr. Delores Williams stating, [...] "I <b>dont</b> <b>think</b> {{we need a}} theory of atonement (Atonement in Christianity)," [...] and, [...] "I <b>dont</b> <b>think</b> we need folks hanging on crosses, and blood dripping, and weird stuff." [...] These comments came during the {{question and answer session}} after her presentation.|$|R
500|$|In 2002, in {{collaboration}} with dynamicist Harold Levison, Stern wrote, [...] "we define an überplanet as a planetary body in orbit around a star that is dynamically important enough to have cleared its neighboring planetesimals ... And we define an unterplanet as one {{that has not been}} able to do so," [...] and then a few paragraphs later, [...] "our Solar System clearly contains 8 überplanets and a far larger number of unterplanets, the largest of which are Pluto and Ceres." [...] While this may appear to contradict Stern's objections, Stern noted in an interview with Smithsonian Air and Space that, unlike the IAU's definition, his definition still allows unterplanets to be planets: [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> from a dynamical standpoint, there are planets that really matter in the architecture of the solar system, and those that don't. They're both planets. Just as you can have wet and dry planets, or life-bearing and non-life-bearing planets, you can have dynamically important planets and dynamically unimportant planets." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{controversial}} from its beginning. The rebellious lead character at the time, Bart, frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior, which led some parents and conservatives to characterize {{him as a}} poor role model for children. Several US public schools banned The Simpsons merchandise and T-shirts, such as one featuring Bart and the caption [...] "Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')". In the season two opening episode [...] "Bart Gets an F", Bart fails four consecutive history exams and the school psychiatrist recommends that Bart repeat the fourth grade. Several critics thought that the episode [...] "Bart Gets an F" [...] {{was a response to}} these controversies. However, Brooks denied that it was a response and added, [...] "we're mindful of it. I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> it's important for us that Bart does badly in school. There are students like that. Besides, I'm very wary of television where everybody {{is supposed to be a}} role model. You don't run across that many role models in real life. Why should television be full of them?" ...|$|E
500|$|Sean Gregory of Time {{wrote of}} Lin's zero Division I {{scholarship}} offers: [...] " [...] was scrawny, but don't doubt {{that a little}} racial profiling, intentional or otherwise, contributed to his underrecruitment." [...] Diepenbrock stated, [...] "If [...] was African American or Caucasian, {{it might have been}} a different deal"; he did not think Lin's race affected his recruiting until later seeing 10 Division I coaches express interest in a black student who Diepenbrock assessed as [...] "a nice junior college player". Lin said: [...] "I'm not saying top-5 state automatically gets you offers, but I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> [...] did affect the way coaches recruited me. I think if I were a different race, I would've been treated differently." [...] Walters added, [...] "People who don't think stereotypes exist are crazy. If [...] white, he's either a good shooter or heady. If he's Asian, he's good at math. We're not taking him." [...] During Lin's college career, fewer than 0.5% of men's Division 1 basketball players were Asian-American.|$|E
