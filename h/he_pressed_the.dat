5|$|Glenn {{remained}} {{an officer in}} the Marine Corps after his selection, but was assigned to the NASA Space Task Group at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The task force moved to Houston, Texas, in 1962, and became part of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center. A portion of the astronauts' training was in space science, but it had a practical aspect, which included scuba diving and work in simulators. Astronauts secured an additional role in the spaceflight program: to provide pilot input in design. The astronauts divided the various tasks between them. Glenn's specialisation was cockpit layout design and control functioning for the Mercury and early Apollo programs. <b>He</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> other astronauts to set a moral example, living up to the squeaky-clean image of them that had been portrayed by Life magazine, a position that was not popular with the other astronauts.|$|E
5|$|The Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch, in March 1965, devolved {{power from}} the center, the National Command, to the Regional Command. From then on, the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command was {{considered}} Syria's ex officios head of state. The Regional Secretary {{had the power to}} appoint the Prime Minister, the cabinet, the chief of staff and top military commanders. Aflaq was unsettled by the way things were moving, and in May he convened the Eighth National Congress to get a showdown between his followers and those of the Military Committee. However, this never came to fruition. Several civilian members of the National Command, such as the Lebanese Jibran Majdalani and the Saudi Ali Ghannam, advised caution, believing that if <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> Military Committee too hard the military would take over the Syrian Regional Branch, and then the Ba'ath Party—as had happened in Iraq following the ousting of the Iraqi Regional Branch.|$|E

25|$|Creech Jones {{specialised}} in Colonial {{affairs in}} Parliament, {{especially those in}} Africa. In June 1936 <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> Government, which were encouraging colonies to set up memorials to King George V, to {{follow the example of}} Uganda and set up a technical educational institution. The Labour Party nominated him to the Colonial Office's Educational Advisory Committee in 1936, on which he served for nine years. In 1937, he was {{a founding member of the}} Trades Union Congress Colonial Affairs Committee, and in 1940 he founded the Fabian Colonial Bureau.|$|E
25|$|John {{has been}} {{assessed}} {{as the greatest}} of the Komnenian emperors. In {{the course of his}} twenty-five year reign, John made alliances with the Holy Roman Empire in the west, decisively defeated the Pechenegs, Hungarians and Serbs in the Balkans, and personally led numerous campaigns against the Turks in Asia Minor. John's campaigns fundamentally changed {{the balance of power in}} the east, forcing the Turks onto the defensive and restoring to the Byzantines many towns, fortresses and cities right across the peninsula. In the southeast, John extended Byzantine control from the Maeander in the west all the way to Cilicia and Tarsus in the east. In an effort to demonstrate the Byzantine ideal of the emperor's role as the leader of the Christian world, John marched into Muslim Syria at the head of the combined forces of Byzantium and the Crusader states; yet despite the great vigour with which <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> campaign, John's hopes were disappointed by the evasiveness of his Crusader allies and their reluctance to fight alongside his forces. Also under John, the empire's population recovered to about 10 million people.|$|E
500|$|By 1829, Anti-Masonry {{had evolved}} into a {{political}} party that proved popular in rural central Pennsylvania. Stevens quickly became prominent in the movement, attending the party's first two national conventions in 1830 and 1831. [...] At the latter, <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> candidacy of Supreme Court Justice John McLean as the party's presidential candidate, but in vain as the nomination fell to former Attorney General William Wirt. [...] Jackson was easily reelected; the crushing defeat (Wirt won only Vermont) caused the party to disappear in most places, though it remained powerful in Pennsylvania for several years.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{remained}} on cordial terms with Senator Seward, Greeley never seriously considered supporting {{him in his}} bid for the Republican nomination for president. Instead, during {{the run-up to the}} 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago, <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> candidacy of former Missouri representative Edward Bates, an opponent of the spread of slavery who had freed his own slaves. In his newspaper, in speeches, and in conversation, Greeley pushed Bates as a man who could win the North and even make inroads in the South. [...] Nevertheless, when one of the dark horse candidates for the Republican nomination, Abraham Lincoln, came to New York to give an address at Cooper Union, Greeley urged his readers to go hear Lincoln, and was among those who accompanied him to the platform. [...] Greeley thought of Lincoln as a possible nominee for vice president.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{spent the}} rest of the 1960s {{fighting}} 10-round contests. In October 1961 Robinson defeated future world champion Denny Moyer via unanimous decision. A 12–5 favorite, the 41-year-old Robinson defeated the 22-year-old Moyer by staying on the outside, rather than engaging him. In their rematch four months later, Moyer defeated Robinson on points, as <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> action and made Robinson back up throughout the fight. Moyer won 7–3 on all three judges scorecards. Robinson lost twice more in 1962, before winning six consecutive fights against mostly lesser opposition. [...] In February 1963 Robinson lost via unanimous decision to former world champion and fellow Hall of Famer Joey Giardello. Giardello knocked Robinson down in the fourth round, and the 43-year-old took until the count of nine to rise to his feet. Robinson was also nearly knocked down in the sixth round, but was saved by the bell. He rallied in the seventh and eight rounds, before struggling in the final two. Robinson then embarked on an 18-month boxing tour of Europe.|$|E
500|$|As Robert's advisor, <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> duke {{to dispute}} Henry's {{claim to the}} crown of England. The {{historian}} David Crouch says that Ranulf [...] "had to provide the strategic vision and energy that Duke Robert lacked", and other historians have agreed that Ranulf's arrival was the catalyst to Curthose's ability to mount an invasion. Ranulf {{was in charge of}} organising transport for the duke's invasion of England, and also secured the defection of some of Henry's ships, thus allowing the fleet to land safely. Robert invaded England in July 1101 along with Ranulf, but Robert agreed at the Treaty of Alton on 2 August 1101 to renounce his claim to the English throne. Although no chronicler mentions Ranulf being present at Alton, he probably was there. Ranulf was pardoned in the treaty and restored to his bishopric, but he chose to stay with Robert for five more years. Some historians, including C. W. Hollister, see the treaty as mainly Ranulf's work, as mainly an attempt to salvage his ecclesiastical career in England, along with a displacement of Ranulf from being the chief councillor of Curthose to merely being one of many.|$|E

500|$|Seward {{had been}} {{interested}} in whaling as a senator; his interest in Russian America was a byproduct of this. In his speech prior to the 1860 convention, he predicted the territory would {{become part of the}} U.S., and when he learned in 1864 that it might be for sale, <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> Russians (then a U.S. ally) for negotiations. The Russian minister, Baron Eduard de Stoeckl, returned home on leave in 1866. [...] Fearing that the territory might be overrun by American settlers and lost, he urged his government to sell it. [...] He was given the authority to make the sale and when he returned in March 1867, negotiated with the Secretary of State. Seward initially offered $5 million; the two men settled on $7 million and on March 15, Seward presented a draft treaty to the Cabinet. Stoeckl's superiors raised several concerns; to induce him to waive them, the final purchase price was increased to $7.2 million. The treaty was signed in the early morning of March 30, 1867, and ratified by the Senate on April 10. [...] Stevens sent the secretary a note of congratulations, predicting that the Alaska purchase would be seen as one of Seward's greatest accomplishments.|$|E
500|$|Due to Egan's {{failure to}} qualify for the playoffs, as soon as the season ended he was {{replaced}} by coach Tom Nissalke. Nissalke knew the Rockets had firepower but needed a rebounding center and a play-making guard, and <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> Rockets management to acquire college standout John Lucas – drafted first overall in the 1976 NBA draft, a pick Houston acquired by sending [...] Gus Bailey, Joe Meriweather and the ninth pick to the Atlanta Hawks – and his former player at the ABA's Utah Stars Moses Malone – while Malone started the 1976–77 season with the Buffalo Braves, Houston acquired him by sending Buffalo first-round picks in the next two drafts. After Malone led the Rockets in rebounding for the first of six straight times, and established a then-NBA record for offensive rebounds in a season, the Rockets posted a franchise-best 49-wins and won the franchise's first Division Title finishing on top of the Central Division. After a first round bye in the playoffs, Houston defeated the Washington Bullets led by former Rocket Elvin Hayes as well as Wes Unseld in seven games in the Eastern Conference semi-finals, and advanced to the conference finals {{for the first time in}} their history, but they lost to the top-seeded Philadelphia 76ers led by former ABA superstar Julius Erving. 4–2.|$|E
500|$|Many Byzantines {{feared the}} Crusade, a view {{endorsed}} by the numerous acts of vandalism and theft practiced by the unruly armies as they marched through Byzantine territory. Byzantine troops followed the Crusaders, attempting to police their behaviour, and further troops were assembled in Constantinople, ready to defend the capital against any acts of aggression. This cautious approach was well advised, but still the numerous incidents of covert and open hostility between the Franks and the Greeks on their line of march, for which it seems both sides were to blame, [...] precipitated conflict between Manuel and his guests. Manuel took the precaution – which his grandfather had not taken – of making repairs to the city walls, and <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> two kings for guarantees concerning the security of his territories. Conrad's army {{was the first to}} enter the Byzantine territory in the summer of 1147, and it figures more prominently in the Byzantine sources, which imply that it was the more troublesome of the two. Indeed, the contemporary Byzantine historian Kinnamos describes a full-scale clash between a Byzantine force and part of Conrad's army, outside the walls of Constantinople. The Byzantines defeated the Germans and, in Byzantine eyes, this reverse caused Conrad to agree to have his army speedily ferried across to Damalis on the Asian shore of the Bosphoros.|$|E

The BBC producer, Pat Dixon heard a tape and took interest in the group. <b>He</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> BBC for a long term contract for the gang, knowing that it would secure Sellers for more than just seasonal work, something for which the BBC had been aiming.

2500|$|In April 1957 Morris {{was ordered}} to pay £1,350 damages to a {{pedestrian}} whom he had knocked down on a zebra crossing while driving his car. Morris remained {{an active member of}} Swansea council and in July 1957 as chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> Minister of Works to remove Swansea Castle from the list of ancient monuments. He argued that the castle was a [...] "shambles" [...] and that the council did not have {{the money to pay for}} its repair, but redevelopment of the site was in the town's interests.

2500|$|A Jewish Ghetto {{police force}} {{enforced}} these rules. On {{at least one}} occasion, the police chief, one Pasternak, in early 1942, carried out a hanging, although it was perceived that {{he was reluctant to}} do so. In that case, the body of the executed woman, Mina Gittelson, whose crime was walking on the sidewalk and not in the street, and not wearing the Jewish badge, was left hanging for three days. [...] Another source says that she had resisted the advances of the manager at the hotel where she worked, and <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> charges of illegal trading against her in retaliation. Also executed was 48-year-old Chaya Mayerova (other sources give her name as Meyorvich and Mejerow), who was shot before the assembled ghetto inhabitants for exchanging a piece of cloth for two kilograms of flour.|$|E
2500|$|Tolkien {{described}} how, in {{the history}} of Dol Guldur, Sauron's growing activity and power increased the tensions among his enemies. The Wise (various Elf-lords and Wizards, including Gandalf the Grey) had sensed an evil power growing in Dol Guldur, and they tried to determine whether Sauron was alive and regaining strength. [...] Tolkien had portrayed the war fought by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men against Sauron {{at the end of the}} Second Age as a devastating struggle, one the Wise hoped not to have to repeat. In response to the growing threat at Dol Guldur, they formed the White Council in , shortly after Sauron's return to the fortress. Much later, in , Gandalf infiltrated the area to probe Dol Guldur, and discovered that the evil presence whose identity he had long suspected was indeed Sauron. The following year <b>he</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> White Council for an attack on Sauron.|$|E
2500|$|When President Wilson {{needed to}} fill the {{position}} of Attorney General {{at the start of}} 1919, party officials, including Palmer's colleagues on the Democratic National Committee and many recipients of his patronage during his tenure as Alien Property Custodian, backed him against other candidates with stronger legal credentials. They argued that the South was over-represented in the Cabinet and that Palmer's political intelligence was critical. Joseph Tumulty, the President's private secretary, advised the President that the office had [...] "great power politically. We should not trust it to anyone who is not heart and soul with us." [...] <b>He</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> President several times. He cabled Wilson in Paris: [...] "Recognition of Palmer ...would be most helpful and cheering to young men of the party....You will make no mistake if appointment is made. It will give us all heart and new courage. Party know of need in tonic like this." [...] He called Palmer [...] "young, militant, progressive and fearless." [...] The President sent Palmer's nomination to the Senate on February 27, 1919, and Palmer took office as a recess appointment on March 5.|$|E
