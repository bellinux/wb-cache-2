Using PCR-free sample preparation we achieved the first in-depth whole genome (hydroxyl) -methylcytosine, single-base-resolution maps from a glioblastoma tumour/margin sample of a patient. Our data provide {{new insights into}} how genetic and <b>epigenetic</b> <b>variations</b> are interrelated. In the tumour, global hypermethylation with a depletion of 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine was observed. The majority of single nucleotide variations were identified as cytosine-to-thymine deamination products within CpG context, where cytosine was preferentially methylated in the margin. Notably, we observe that cells neighbouring tumour cells display epigenetic alterations characteristic of the tumour itself although genetically they appear “normal”.

40|$|Investigation of the {{relationships}} of phenotypic and <b>epigenetic</b> <b>variations</b> {{might be a good}} way to dissect the genetic or molecular basis of phenotypic variation and plasticity in plants. Castor bean (Ricinus communis L.), an important non-edible oilseed crop, is a mono-species genus plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. Since it displays rich phenotypic variations with low genetic diversity, castor bean is a good model to investigate the molecular basis of phenotypic and <b>epigenetic</b> <b>variations.</b> Cytosine DNA methylation represents a major molecular mechanism of epigenetic occurrence. In this study, epigenetic diversity of sixty landrace accessions collected worldwide was investigated using the methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) technique. Results showed that the epigenetic diversity (based on the polymorphism of DNA methylated loci) exhibited a medium variation (Ne =  1. 395, He =  0. 242, I =  0. 366) at the population level though the variation was great, ranging from 3. 80 % to 34. 31 % among accessions. Both population structure analysis and the phylogenetic construction (using the neighbor-joining criteria) revealed that the two main clades were identified, but they did not display a distinct geographic structure. After inspecting the location of polymorphic methylated loci on genome we identified that the polymorphic methylated loci occur widely in nuclear and organelle genomes.

40|$|Background: Recent {{genome-wide}} studies {{suggested that}} in addition to genetic <b>variations,</b> <b>epigenetic</b> <b>variations</b> may also be associated with differential gene expression and growth vigor in plant hybrids. Maize is an ideal model system for the study of <b>epigenetic</b> <b>variations</b> in hybrids given the significant heterotic performance, the well-known complexity of the genome, and the rich history in epigenetic studies. However, integrated comparative transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses in different organs of maize hybrids remain largely unexplored. Results: Here, we generated integrated maps of transcriptomes and epigenomes of shoots and roots of two maize inbred lines and their reciprocal hybrids, and globally surveyed the <b>epigenetic</b> <b>variations</b> and their relationships with transcriptional divergence between different organs and genotypes. We observed that whereas histone modifications vary both between organs and between genotypes, DNA methylation patterns are more distinguishable between genotypes than between organs. Histone modifications were associated with transcriptomic divergence between organs and between hybrids and parents. Further, we show that genes up-regulated in both shoots and roots of hybrids were significantly enriched in the nucleosome assembly pathway. Interestingly, 22 - and 24 -nt siRNAs were shown to be derived from distinct transposable elements, and for different transposable elements in both shoots and roots, the differences in siRNA activity between hybrids and patents were primarily driven by different siRNA species. Conclusions: These results suggest that despite variations in specific genes or genomic loci, similar mechanisms may account for the genome-wide epigenetic regulation of gene activity and transposon stability in different organs of maize hybrids...|$|R

Some of the inherited methylation differences were specific to certain tissues, and the differential methylation at specific loci were not altered much after intercrossing between Red Junglefowl and domesticated laying hens for eight generations.The results hint that domestication has led to epigenetic changes, as domesticated chickens maintained a higher level of methylation for more than 70% of the genes.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Monosomic alien {{addition}} lines (MAALs) {{can easily}} induce structural variation of chromosomes {{and have been}} used in crop breeding; however, it is unclear whether MAALs will induce drastic genetic and epigenetic alterations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, wheat-rye 2 R and 5 R MAALs together with their selfed progeny and parental common wheat were investigated through amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) analyses. The MAALs in different generations displayed different genetic variations. Some progeny that only contained 42 wheat chromosomes showed great genetic/epigenetic alterations. Cryptic rye chromatin has introgressed into the wheat genome. However, one of the progeny that contained cryptic rye chromatin did not display outstanding genetic/epigenetic variation. 78 and 49 sequences were cloned from changed AFLP and MSAP bands, respectively. Blastn search indicated that almost half of them showed no significant similarity to known sequences. Retrotransposons were mainly involved in genetic and <b>epigenetic</b> <b>variations.</b> Genetic variations basically affected Gypsy-like retrotransposons, whereas epigenetic alterations affected Copia-like and Gypsy-like retrotransposons equally. Genetic and <b>epigenetic</b> <b>variations</b> seldom affected low-copy coding DNA sequences. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results in the present study provided direct evidence to illustrate that monosomic wheat-rye addition lines could induce different and drastic genetic/epigenetic variations and these variations might not be caused by introgression of rye chromatins into wheat. Therefore, MAALs may be directly used as an effective means to broaden the genetic diversity of common wheat...|$|R

50|$|Longitudinal studies {{follow a}} cohort of {{individuals}} {{over an extended period}} of time, usually from birth or before disease onset. Samples are taken and records are kept over many years, making these studies extremely useful to determine causality of particular phenotypes. Since the same individuals are followed at time points before and after disease onset, it removes the confounding effects of differences between cases and controls. Longitudinal studies are not only useful for risk studies (using DNA samples prior to disease onset), but also in intervention studies using pre- and posttreatment with specific exposures to investigate environmental impacts on the epigenome. A major disadvantage is the long timeline of the studies as well as the expense. Longitudinal studies using disease-discordant monozygotic twins gives the added benefit of ruling out genetic influences on <b>epigenetic</b> <b>variation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} {{is controlled by}} two different mechanisms: genetic and <b>epigenetic.</b> Genetic <b>variations</b> are based on differences in DNA-sequences due to mutation and recombination events. <b>Epigenetic</b> <b>variations,</b> on the other hand, are not encoded through the nucleotide sequences of DNA, but rather through the chemical modification of either DNA or its associated proteins which results in certain genes being turned on or off. It appears that methylation, but also acetylation or ubiquitylation, lead to different molecular outcomes, resulting in phenomena such as the inactivation of the X-chromosome, genomic imprinting, or different types of cancer. Epigenetics will have profound effects on our understanding of human and environmental health by forcing us to look afresh on interactions between (wo) men with their natural and social environment and by adding a transgenerational, even evolutionary, aspect to the debate.

50|$|Forms of histone {{methylation}} cause {{repression of}} certain genes that are stably inherited through mitosis {{but that can}} also be erased during meiosis or with the progression of time. The induction of flowering by exposure to low winter temperatures in Arabidopsis thaliana shows this effect. Histone methylation participates in repression of expression of an inhibitor of flowering during cold. In annual, semelparous species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, this histone methylation is stably inherited through mitosis after return from cold to warm temperatures giving the plant the opportunity to flower continuously during spring and summer until it senesces. However, in perennial, iteroparous relatives the histone modification rapidly disappears when temperatures rise, allowing expression of the floral inhibitor to increase and limiting flowering to a short interval. Epigenetic histone modifications control a key adaptive trait in Arabidopsis thaliana, and their pattern changes rapidly during evolution associated with reproductive strategy.Another study tested several epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana - lines with similar genomes but varying levels of DNA methylation - for their drought sensitivity and their sensitivity to nutritional stress. It was {{found that there was}} a significant amount of heritable variation in the lines in regards to traits important for survival of drought and nutrient stress. This study proved that variation in DNA methylation can result in heritable variation of ecologically important plant traits, such as root allocation, drought tolerance, and nutrient plasticity.

50|$|What is {{the origin}} of these changes? In earlier work Crow {{considered}} but was able to rule out a viral causation. There is a genetic component but its nature has been obscure. Crow {{is known for his}} suggestion that schizophrenia is a widespread genetic anomaly which arose quite recently in human evolution. He believes that it arose with the evolution of language and that the two are linked. In his argument, he says that schizophrenia is associated with atypical patterns of lateralisation - which is the differential functioning of the left and right cerebral hemispheres. He argues that through studying <b>epigenetic</b> <b>variation,</b> we can look at the changes in human evolution and see where the alterations in our genes have occurred, that lead to language development and henceforth schizophrenia. Crow reported that lateralisation occurs greater in males, who undergo more severe psychosis. Crow’s particular recent contribution has been the proposal that the origins of the psychoses relate particularly to those characteristics (e.g. cerebral asymmetry) that are associated with the specifically human capacity for language. This leads to a theory of {{the origin of}} psychotic symptoms - that they are associated with deviations in the subtle asymmetries of development of the cortex, and that the symptoms arise as confusions between thought and speech and through the abnormal attachment of meaning to perceived speech - and to its genetic basis in the change that led to the evolution of Homo sapiens as a species.|$|E

40|$|Tomato {{plants are}} used as a model system to study fruit {{development}} and quality. Tomato fruit development {{can be divided into}} three main phases: cell division, cell elongation and fruit ripening. All these phases are associated with deep changes at the gene expression {{as well as at the}} epigenetic level. Cytosine methylation is an epigenetic mark associated with genetic inactivity and heterochromatin state in higher eukaryotes, including plants. In plants cytosines are mainly methylated at CG and CXG contexts and, at low levels, at CXX. These methylated sequences are widespread in the whole genome, but are present at higher density at LTR-retrotransposons. Using genomic DNA methylation assays, we analysed the global and locus specific variations of CG and CXG methylation patterns to understand the potential role of epigenetic mechanisms during the development of tomato plants. The analysis showed changes in the cytosine methylation pattern at CG and CXG sites in fruits of the cultivated tomato Ailsa Craig (Teyssier et al., 2008, Planta 228 : 391 - 9). Domesticated and wild tomato species do show remarkable differences in terms of shape, colour, timing and development of fruits, therefore it is very interesting to compare these species also in terms of <b>epigenetic</b> <b>variations.</b> The preliminary comparative analysis of DNA methylation in wild and cultivated tomato species indicated contrasting situations, characterized by different patterns of DNA methylation at repetitive loci such as the 5 S rDNA, various retrotransposons and at single loci.
