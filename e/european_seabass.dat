50|$|In {{the place}} where the river flows into the sea, there has been formed over the years an {{extended}} Delta of 4.000 hectares, because of the large dam that was constructed and retains much of the brought matters. As a result, silting has benn greatly reduced and during the summer, when there is no much water, the sea enters and largely overwhelms the river bed. Flathead mullets and <b>European</b> <b>seabasses</b> are found in Haliakmon's Delta. In the shallow marine areas formed there, the fry of many Aegean Sea's fish finds a place to reproduce, while about 90% of Greece's mussels are produced in the Haliakmon-Axios(Vardar) Delta. Aliki Kitrous is an area of 254 hectares, where 15-20.000 tons of salt are produced per year.|$|R

40|$|The {{safety of}} {{azamethiphos}} (AZA), an organophosphorous insecticide and {{the active ingredient}} of Salmosan(,) ((R)) was evaluated in the <b>European</b> eel, <b>seabass</b> and rainbow trout. Fish were bathed in 0. 1 ppm AZA {{for a period of}} 60, 120 or 240 min. After termination of each treatment fish were transferred to clean aquaria and randomly sampled over 21 days. Compared to controls, brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was inhibited up to 44, 56 and 62 % in eels, seabass and trout, respectively, with the inhibition being significant for up to 4 days in eels and seabass and 7 days in trout. As result of the AChE depression, fish displayed motor hyperactivity and erratic jumping at the onset of treatment. Mortality was observed only in trout following exposure for 240 min. A variable correlation observed among species between the level of exposure, the reduced activity of brain AChE and the signs of toxicity suggest that brain AChE should be considered as an indicator of exposure rather than as an index of toxicity of AZA. The present data indicate that at the therapeutic dosage of 0. 1 ppm AZA for I h can be safely used in eels, seabass and trout. The extended treatment times up to 240 min were equally safe for eels and seabass but not for trout. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The larger fishing trawlers operate from Milford Haven, which was recognised by Lord Nelson as [...] "one of the greatest natural harbours in the world". In 1890, there were 1,660 fishing vessels using Milford Haven's docks and it became one of Britain's most successful fishing ports.

40|$|The photoreceptive teleost pineal is {{considered}} to be essential to the generation, synchronisation and maintenance of biological rhythms, primarily via melatonin release. The role of internal (circadian clock) and external (light) signals controlling melatonin production in the fish pineal differs between species, yet the reasons underpinning this remain largely unknown. Whilst in salmonids, pineal melatonin is apparently regulated directly by light, in all other studied teleosts, rhythmic melatonin production persists endogenously under the regulation of clock gene expression. To better understand the role of clocks in teleost pineals, this study aimed to characterise the expression of selected clock genes in vitro under different photoperiodic conditions in comparison to in vivo in both Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and in <b>European</b> <b>seabass</b> (Dicentrarchus labrax) (in vitro 12 L: 12 D), a species known to display endogenous rhythmic melatonin synthesis. Results revealed no rhythmic clock gene (Clock, Period 1 & 2) expression in Atlantic salmon or <b>European</b> <b>seabass</b> (Clock and Period 1) pineal in vitro. However rhythmic expression of Cryptochrome 2 and Period 1 in the Atlantic salmon pineal was observed in vivo, which infers extra-pineal regulation of clocks in this species. No rhythmic arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (Aanat 2) expression was observed in the Atlantic salmon yet in the <b>European</b> <b>seabass,</b> circadian Aanat 2 expression was observed.
