25|$|The actual {{temperature}} in a <b>drying</b> <b>kiln</b> is the dry-bulb temperature (usually denoted by Tg), {{which is the}} temperature of a vapour-gas mixture determined by inserting a thermometer with a dry bulb. On the other hand, the wet-bulb temperature (TW) {{is defined as the}} temperature reached by a small amount of liquid evaporating in a large amount of an unsaturated air-vapour mixture. The temperature sensing element of this thermometer is kept moist with a porous fabric sleeve (cloth) usually put in a reservoir of clean water. A minimum air flow of 2m/s is needed to prevent a zone of stagnant damp air formation around the sleeve (Walker et al., 1993). Since air passes over the wet sleeve, water is evaporated and cools the wet-bulb thermometer. The difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, the wet-bulb depression, is used to determine the relative humidity from a standard hygrometric chart (Walker et al., 1993). A higher difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures indicates a lower relative humidity. For example, if the dry-bulb temperature is 100°C and wet-bulb temperature 60°C, then the relative humidity is read as 17% from a hygrometric chart.|$|E
500|$|Altrincham Fair became St James's Fair or Samjam in 1319 and {{continued}} until 1895. Fair days {{had their own}} court of Pye Powder (a corruption of the French for [...] "dusty feet"), presided over by the mayor and held to settle disputes arising from the day's dealings. By 1348 the town had 120burgage plots– ownership of land used {{as a measure of}} status and importance in an area– putting it {{on a par with the}} Cheshire town of Macclesfield and above Stockport and Knutsford. The earliest known residence in Altrincham was [...] "the Knoll", on Stamford Street near the centre of the medieval town. An 1983 excavation on the demolished building, made by South Trafford Archaeological Group, discovered evidence that the house dated from the 13th or 14th century, and that it may have contained a <b>drying</b> <b>kiln</b> or malting floor. During the English Civil War, men from Altrincham fought for the Parliamentarian Sir George Booth. During the war, armies camped on nearby Bowdon Downs on several occasions.|$|E
