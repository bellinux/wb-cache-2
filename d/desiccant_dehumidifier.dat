H 577 P BSE 2017 WangLxxii, 173 pages :color illustrationsThe liquid {{desiccant}} dehumidification is {{a promising}} alternative method for removing {{moisture from the}} process air, which can achieve more effective independent humidity control in the built environment at lower energy cost. In recent years, a diversity of liquid desiccant hybrid air conditioning systems have been developed. Control issues are becoming critical for maintaining normal operation and improving {{the performance of the}} systems under dynamic working conditions. The dehumidifier is a critical component where the coupled heat and mass transfer between the desiccant solution and the air occurs. Understanding the dynamic characteristics of the dehumidifier is essential to design and tune controllers, and to develop operation strategies for the hybrid systems in the real operation. However, almost all existing researches on the liquid <b>desiccant</b> <b>dehumidifier</b> focus on steady state conditions. Few research efforts have been made on its dynamic characteristics. For better understanding the dynamic characteristics of the dehumidifier and for more realistic dynamic simulation of hybrid systems involving real-time control, the experimental study and a computationally efficient yet reasonably accurate dynamic model of the dehumidifier are needed. In addition, the liquid <b>desiccant</b> <b>dehumidifier</b> usually occupies large installation space. The potential drawback in big dimension of the liquid desiccant system hinders its wide applications. There is a lack of research on the dehumidification performance of a compact liquid <b>desiccant</b> <b>dehumidifier.</b> Therefore, this research aims to study the dehumidification performance of a compact liquid <b>desiccant</b> <b>dehumidifier</b> and the dynamic characteristics of the liquid <b>desiccant</b> <b>dehumidifier</b> using both experimental study and numerical modelling. The main works of this research are shown as follows. Firstly, an experimental test rig has been built to study the dehumidification performance of a liquid <b>desiccant</b> <b>dehumidifier.</b> The dehumidifier adopts counter flow configuration and structured packing. In order to examine the measurement accuracy and the adiabatic condition of the experiments, uncertainty analysis for the measured parameters, dynamic responses of the temperature and humidity sensors to step changes, and energy and mass balance analysis are conducted, respectively. Secondly, experimental studies on the dehumidification performance of a compact liquid <b>desiccant</b> <b>dehumidifier</b> using structured packing with a high specific surface area (650 m 2 /m 3) are conducted. New empirical equations correlating the moisture effectiveness and the enthalpy effectiveness as well as the heat and mass transfer coefficients with critical inlet parameters are developed. Lewis number during the dehumidification process is also discussed to analyze the coupled heat and mass transfer characteristics. The performance of the present type of packing is compared with other types of packing studied in literature. Besides, the influences of the inlet conditions of the air and the desiccant as well as the packing height on the dehumidification performance are also investigated and compared with the results reported in previous studies, which is valuable for the design of compact liquid desiccant dehumidifiers. Thirdly, the dynamic heat and mass transfer characteristics of a counter-flow packed-type liquid <b>desiccant</b> <b>dehumidifier</b> are studied experimentally. Two types of transient working conditions are tested in experiments: {{at the beginning of a}} dehumidification process (by two different scenarios) and the step changes of inlet fluids parameters (inlet air humidity ratio and the solution flow rate). Dynamic responses of the outlet air and desiccant solution as well as dynamic moisture removal rate are displayed and discussed. Fourthly, a simplified one-dimensional dynamic model is also developed for simulating the dynamic characteristics of the counter flow packed-type liquid <b>desiccant</b> <b>dehumidifier.</b> Convenient approaches to quantifying the thermal mass of the packing and the desiccant solution held in the dehumidifier are proposed, which are essential parameters of the dynamic model. Numerical solution for the proposed model is developed. The model is tested and validated experimentally under different transient operating conditions. Finally, the dynamic characteristics of the dehumidifier are investigated by parameter analysis method. Time constants of the dynamic humidity and temperature of outlet air are introduced to evaluate the dynamic response of the dehumidifier. The influences of two operation parameters (i. e. the air flow rate and the solution flow rate) and one configuration parameter (i. e. the height of the packing) on the time constants are analyzed experimentally. Besides, the influences of thermal mass of the dehumidifier on the time constants are also analyzed using the proposed dynamic model. Department of Building Services EngineeringPh.

Accurate determination of humidity ratio is critical to this work {{and an understanding of}} the capabilities of the available instrumentation is central to its proper application. This paper compares the minimum theoretical random error in humidity ratio calculation for three common measurement methods to give a sense of the relative maximum accuracy possible for each method assuming systematic errors can be made negligible. A series of experiments conducted also illustrate the capabilities of relative humidity sensors as compared to dewpoint sensors in measuring the grain depression of <b>desiccant</b> <b>dehumidifiers.</b> These tests support the results of the uncertainty analysis.

An interesting possible application of these starch-based adsorbents is the <b>desiccant</b> wheel <b>dehumidifier.</b> The <b>desiccant</b> wheel <b>dehumidifier</b> is used in conjunction with a standard air conditioning system. In this process, ambient air is passed through a stationary section while a wheel packed with desiccant rotates through that section. The desiccant adsorbs humidity (latent load) from the air, and the air conditioning system then cools the air (sensible load). Several starch based adsorbents were developed and tested for adsorptive capacity in a new high throughput screening system. The best formulations from the high throughput screening system, also taking into account economic considerations and structural integrity, were considered for use in the <b>desiccant</b> wheel <b>dehumidifier.</b> A suitable adsorbent was chosen and formulated into a matrix structure for the desiccant wheel system.

The control of moisture content in the air using traditional air conditioning techniques is not a suitable option due to large consumption of primary energy and hence emission of greenhouse gases. The evaporative cooling technology is a cost effective and eco-friendly alternative but can provide thermal comfort conditions only under low humidity conditions.

As the Building America program researches construction of homes that achieve greater source energy savings over typical mid- 1990 s construction, proper modeling of whole-house latent loads and operation of humidity control equipment has become a high priority. Long-term high relative humidity can cause health and durability problems in homes, particularly in a hot-humid climate. In this study, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) used the latest EnergyPlus tool equipped with the moisture capacitance model {{to analyze the}} indoor relative humidity in three home types: a Building America high-performance home; a mid- 1990 s reference home; and a 2006 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) -compliant home in hot-humid climate zones. They examined the impacts of various dehumidification equipment and controls on the high-performance home where the dehumidification equipment energy use can become a much larger portion of whole-house energy consumption. The research included a number of simulated cases: thermostat reset, A/C with energy recovery ventilator, heat exchanger assisted A/C, A/C with condenser reheat, A/C with <b>desiccant</b> wheel <b>dehumidifier,</b> A/C with DX dehumidifier, A/C with energy recovery ventilator, and DX dehumidifier. Space relative humidity, thermal comfort, and whole-house source energy consumption were compared for indoor relative humidity set points of 50 %, 55 %, and 60 %. The study revealed why similar trends of high humidity were observed in all three homes regardless of energy efficiency, and why humidity problems are not necessarily unique in the high-performance home. Thermal comfort analysis indicated that occupants are unlikely to notice indoor humidity problems. The study confirmed that supplemental dehumidification is needed to maintain space relative humidity (RH) below 60 % in a hot-humid climate home. Researchers also concluded that while all the active dehumidification options {{included in the study}} successfully controlled space relative humidity excursions, the increase in whole-house energy consumption was much more sensitive to the humidity set point than the chosen technology option. In the high-performance home, supplemental dehumidification equipment results in a significant source energy consumption penalty at 50 % RH set point (12. 6 %- 22. 4 %) compared to the consumption at 60 % RH set point (1. 5 %- 2. 7 %). At 50 % and 55 % RH set points, A/C with <b>desiccant</b> wheel <b>dehumidifier</b> and A/C with ERV and high-efficiency DX dehumidifier stand out as the two cases resulting in the smallest increase of source energy consumption. At an RH set point of 60 %, all explicit dehumidification technologies result in similar insignificant increases in source energy consumption and thus are equally competitive...|$|R
40|$|Vapour {{compression}} based {{air conditioners}} {{are being used}} for comfort cooling in residences, offices and commercial buildings in many countries throughout the world. Several issues arise seriously challenge the conventional technology which include harmful impact of CFCs and HCFCs on environment, energy and cost problems etc. However use of low energy and eco friendly techniques {{may be helpful to}} overcome these problems up to some extent. The evaporative cooling may be considered as one of such eco friendly methods of achieving comfortable conditions in buildings during summer. These systems have great potential to provide thermal comfort in places where ambient air humidity is low. Such systems alone are not efficient for humidclimatic conditions. However such systems can be used if combined with <b>desiccant</b> based <b>dehumidifier.</b> India with its widely different climates has been divided into six climatic zones viz. Hot and Dry, Moderate, Warm and Humid, Composite, Cold and Cloudy and Cold and Sunny. This paper examines the potential of a simple desiccant evaporative cooling cycle in five selected cities in Warm and Humid climatic zone of India. The coefficient of performance (COP) has been computed for each location and compared. It has been found that COP for different cities varies in the range of 0. 14 to 0. 21. Mumbai (coastal city) has been identified as the city where desiccant evaporative cooling system can be operated with higher COP compared to that of other cities in the same climatic zone...|$|R
