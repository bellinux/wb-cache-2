5|$|Given {{the sufferings}} that some Indigenous {{children}} {{experienced in the}} Canadian Residential School system, the Holy Father expressed his sorrow at the anguish caused by the deplorable conduct of {{some members of the}} Church and he offered his sympathy and prayerful solidarity. <b>His</b> <b>Holiness</b> emphasized that acts of abuse cannot be tolerated in society. He prayed that all those affected would experience healing, and he encouraged First Nations Peoples to continue to move forward with renewed hope.|$|E

As chancellor, Walter began the keeping of the Charter Roll, a record of all charters issued by the chancery. Walter was not noted for <b>his</b> <b>holiness</b> in life or learning, but historians have judged {{him one of the}} most outstanding government ministers in English history.|$|E

5|$|Stalin {{took several}} {{measures}} in persecuting the Armenian Church, already {{weakened by the}} Armenian Genocide and the Russification policies of the Russian Empire. In the 1920s, the private property of the church was confiscated and priests were harassed. Soviet assaults against the Armenian Church accelerated under Stalin, beginning in 1929, but momentarily eased in the following years to improve the country's relations with the Armenian diaspora. In 1932, Khoren Muradpekyan became known as Khoren I and assumed the title of <b>His</b> <b>Holiness</b> the Catholicos. However, in the late 1930s, the Soviets renewed their attacks against the Church. This culminated {{in the murder of}} Khoren in 1938 as part of the Great Purge, and the closing of the Catholicosate of Echmiatsin on August 4, 1938. The Church, however, managed to survive underground and in the diaspora.|$|E
5|$|While doctrinal {{controversy}} led to {{the withdrawal}} of ministers, the fellowship experienced growth in subsequent years. District councils were organized in various {{regions of the country}} and, where these did not exist, home missionary fields were designated to maximize evangelistic efforts. In 1917, W. Jethro Walthall led <b>his</b> <b>Holiness</b> Baptist Association of southwestern Arkansas into the Assemblies of God. District councils and missionary stations were established outside the U.S. also. By 1921, there were districts in Canada (see Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada), China, Japan (see Japan Assemblies of God), India (see Assemblies of God in India), and Egypt. Central Bible College was started {{in the basement of the}} Central Assembly of God church in Springfield, Missouri, in 1922. In 1929, the fellowship claimed 91,981 members in 1,612 churches.|$|E

5|$|Lesser Roman Catholic prelates use {{a variety}} of colors.

The lowest grade of monsignor, a Chaplain of <b>His</b> <b>Holiness,</b> uses a black hat with violet tassels. The superior general of an order displays a black galero with six tassels on each side, while provincial superiors and abbots use a black galero with six or three tassels on each side, although Norbertines (White Canons) use a white galero. Although a priest would rarely assume arms unless he had an ancestral right to arms independent of his clerical state, a priest would use a simple black ecclesiastical hat with a single tassel on each side. Priests who hold an office such as rector would have two tassels on each side.|$|E

25|$|Under Paul VI, the Secretariat of State set minimum {{qualifications}} {{of age and}} priesthood for the appointment of Chaplains of <b>His</b> <b>Holiness</b> (35 {{years of age and}} 10 of priesthood), Honorary Prelates (45 of age and 15 of priesthood) and Protonotaries Apostolic Supernumerary (55 of age and 20 of priesthood). However, it waived the minimum age limit for vicars general proposed for appointment as Honorary Prelates, {{in view of the fact}} that, as long as they hold the office of vicar general, they also held the still higher rank of Protonotary Apostolic Supernumerary. For the same reason, the Secretariat of State did not consider it appropriate that someone who was already a vicar general be appointed only a Chaplain of <b>His</b> <b>Holiness.</b> All these criteria have been superseded by the 2013 decision of Pope Francis to grant only the title of Chaplain of <b>His</b> <b>Holiness</b> and to require even for this a minimum age of 65 years.|$|E
