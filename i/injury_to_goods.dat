Findings illustrated that urban design and land use regulations could accomplish the complementary goals of preventing illness and ensuring environmental quality. For example, creating higher density, mixed-use developments closer to transit and job centers would enhance public safety, prevent motor-vehicle <b>injuries,</b> increase access <b>to</b> <b>goods</b> and services, encourage walking or bicycling, reduce air pollution, and limit global warming.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} the re-operation rate on the distal ureter after upper pole heminephrectomy with incomplete ureterectomy. Patients and methods The case notes from one institution were reviewed retrospectively; 60 upper pole heminephrectomies with incomplete ureterectomy were undertaken in 39 girls and 16 boys (mean age at primary surgery 27 months, range 3 - 88). Results Thirty-two children (58 %) had an antenatal diagnosis while 12 (22 %) {{presented with a}} urinary tract infection (UTI) and six (11 %) with urinary incontinence. Twenty-nine of the 60 renal units (48 %) had an associated ureterocele and in nine (15 %) the ureter was ectopic. Ten infants (18 %) underwent initial puncture of a ureterocele. Five patients (8 %), all females, required lower urinary tract re-operation. The indications for secondary surgery were recurrent UTIs in all and a prolapsed ureterocele in one. All five had ultrasonographic evidence of a dilated ureteric stump. Reflux into the retained stump was detected in one child. Conclusions The re-operation rate for a redundant ureteric stump in this series was 8 %. The risk of <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> the <b>good</b> ureter may outweigh {{the benefits of a}} complete ureterectomy...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Laryngotracheal {{trauma is}} a rare but {{clinically}} important injury. Complications are frequent. Early recognition, accurate evaluation and proper treatment is vital. In order to learn from our past experience and refine our management, we reviewed our cases. METHODS: Fifteen patients with external laryngotracheal injuries were analyzed retrospectively. The outcome was assessed {{both in terms of}} voice and airway, on short term and long term basis. RESULTS: Commonest cause of injury was cut throat injuries followed by road traffic accidents. The main presenting symptoms and signs were hoarseness, haemoptysis, odynophagia and stridor. Major laryngeal injuries (10 cases) outnumbered minor injuries (5 cases). A good association exists between the symptoms of haemoptysis and stridor at presentation and severity of the injury. Sites of laryngeal injury included; thyroid cartilage, mixed soft tissue and cartilaginous injuries, thyrohyoid membrane, aryepiglottic fold and cricothyroid membrane. Ten patients presented within 24 hours of the injury. Out come (airway and voice) was good in 12 patients whereas it was poor in 3 patients. Poor results were seen in patients who had delayed surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: The presence of stridor and haemoptysis are suggestive of major injury. Early surgical intervention is recommended for all major <b>injuries</b> <b>to</b> ensure a <b>good</b> outcome...|$|R

Finite element analysis is used to find the value of stress that has been used in analytical equation. The design of the model specimen drawn by Solidworks software and then imported into the Patran software to key in data such as load, material, element, and properties. Then, Nastran software is used as a solver and decision analysis model will be produced when the specimen is successful simulated. Comparisons are made between the simulation using finite element analysis and previous research. The result shows that the fracture toughness decreasing when the thickness is increasing.

Open reduction and internal fIXation with k-wire for displaced supracondylar fracture of the humerus is practiced widely in many centers. Various approaches and techniques for open reduction {{of this type}} of fracture have been described by various authors. (Ramsey and Griz 1973,Carcassonne et al 1972) In Hospital lpoh, posterior or lateral approach is commonly used. All patients treated with open reduction and k-wiring in Hospital lpoh from January 1997 till April 1998 were reviewed. Out of total patients operated during the study period, 36 returned for final follow-up. They were re-examined to assess the functional outcome, range af motion and incidence of cubitus varus of the affected elbow, as well as surgical and cosmetic complications. The posterior approach group was noted to have higher incidence of surgical complications eg cubitus varus defonnity and reduced range of elbow motion. This also included nerve <b>injury,</b> failure <b>to</b> achieve <b>good</b> reduction at first attempt of open reduction and unsightly scar and painful scar.
