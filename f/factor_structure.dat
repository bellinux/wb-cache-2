40|$|The paper {{develops}} a new modeling framework to study <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> and Arbitrage Pricing Theory in large asset markets. The asset economy in this framework {{consists of a}} continuum of assets. Finite subsets of assets are interpreted as random draws from the underlying economy. I show {{that the absence of}} arbitrage opportunities (or equilvalently, the continuity of the pricing function) implies, under the traditional assumptions, exact factor-pricing for a full measure of assets. In particular, with probability one, in a typical finite subset of assets, all assets are exactly factor-priced. I further show that approximate <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> exist in general, and that they can be chosedn efficiently according to a measure of explanatory power in the spirit of R(squared) in Econometrics. The definition of approximate <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> here is less stringent than in Chamberlain and Rothchild (1983), yet still sufficiently strong to imply approximate factor pricing for most assets. <b>Factor</b> <b>structures</b> in the present model are also robust to using proxies to replace the true factors. None of these results hold in the traditional modeling approach in which the large asset economy is represented by an infinite sequence of assets. I provide examples explaining the reasons for the sharp differences between the implications of the two modeling approaches. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{variability}} of health complaints within individuals across time {{has rarely been}} studied, and the question whether between- and within-person <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> of health-related variables are equivalent has not been tested so far. We examined self-reported health complaints in 101 younger (20 - 31 years) and 103 older adults (65 - 80 years) {{over a period of}} 100 daily assessments. Data were analyzed with confirmatory two-level <b>factor</b> analysis. One-factor <b>structures</b> of health complaints provided an acceptable fit at the between- and average within-person levels in both age groups, supporting the assumption of equivalent average within- and between-person <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> for health complaints. Age differences in loading patterns indicated that subjective health may be experienced differently by younger and older adults. Small age differences in mean levels of health symptoms were observed. Intraindividual variability in health complaints was reliable. Older adults fluctuated less from day to day than younger adults, presumably reflecting less fluctuation in objective health, differences in response styles, situational influences, or habituation processes. We conclude that future research should consider intraindividual variability as being descriptive of a person's health status, and take possible differences between within-and between-person <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> of subjective health into account...|$|R

30|$|Given {{that there}} is an {{increase}} in the use of computers in speaking assessments, it is necessary to better understand how the mode of computer delivery affects speaking assessments. Therefore, in the present study, the psychometric qualities of computer-delivered and face-to-face monologic tasks were examined; specifically, test scores and the underlying <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> of these tasks were compared. Indeed, professional testing standards (AERA et al. 1999) have underscored that score equivalence is significant and should be established prior to the interpretation of computerized test scores. Furthermore, exploring how the underlying <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> vary between the two modes will provide valuable insight into the interpretation of test scores on computer-delivered speaking tests.|$|R
