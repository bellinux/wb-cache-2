40|$|Attenuating {{primaries}} and free-surface multiples of vertical cable (VC) data while preserving receiver <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> primaries Luc T. Ikelle⁄ Marine vertical cable (VC) data contain primaries, re-ceiver ghosts, free-surface multiples, and internal multi-ples just like towed-streamer data. However, the imaging of towed-streamer data {{is based on}} primary reflections, while the emerging imaging algorithms of VC data tend to use the receiver <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> primary reflections instead of the primaries themselves. I present an algorithm for attenuating primaries, free-surface multiples, and the re-ceiver <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> free-surface multiples while preserving the receiver <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> primaries. My multiple attenuation algorithm of VC data {{is based on an}} inverse scattering approach known, which is a predict-then-subtract method. It assumes that surface seismic data are available or that they can be computed from VC data after an up/down wavefield separation at the receiver locations (streamer data add to VC data some of the wave paths needed for multiple attenua-tion). The combination of surface seismic data with VC data allows one to predict free-surface multiples and re-ceiver ghosts as well as the receiver <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> primary reflections. However, if the direct wave arrivals are re-moved from the VC data, this combination will not pre-dict the receiver <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> primary reflections. I use this property to attenuate primaries, free-surface multiples, and receiver ghosts from VC data, preserving only the receiver <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> primaries. This method can be used for multicomponent ocean bottom cable data (i. e., arrays of sea-floor geophones and hydrophones) without any modification to attenuate primaries, free-surface multiples, and the receiver <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> free-surface multiples while preserving the receiver <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> primaries...|$|R

5|$|Day-Lewis {{returned}} to the stage in 1989 to work with Richard Eyre, in Hamlet at the National Theatre, London, but collapsed during the scene where the <b>ghost</b> <b>of</b> Hamlet's father appears before him. He began sobbing uncontrollably and refused {{to go back on}} stage; he was replaced by Jeremy Northam who finished the performance word-and-action-perfect and received a standing ovation. Ian Charleson then formally replaced Day-Lewis {{for the rest of the}} run, except that Charleson's ill-health forced Northam to stand in again many times. Although the incident was officially attributed to exhaustion, Day-Lewis later claimed to have seen the <b>ghost</b> <b>of</b> his own father. He has not appeared on stage since. The media attention following his breakdown on-stage contributed to his decision to eventually move from England to Ireland in the mid-1990s to regain a sense of privacy amidst his increasing fame.|$|E

5000|$|Hungry ghosts are {{different}} from the <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> Chinese traditions, which all people are believed to become after death. According to the Buddha Dharma, there are three main groups of hungry ghosts: those with no wealth, those with a little and those with a lot. [...] Those with no wealth are broken into three groups: the torch or flaming mouths, in which food and drink become flames; the needle mouths, whose throats are so tiny that food cannot pass through; and the vile mouths, whose mouths are so decomposed and smelly that they cannot ingest anything. The ghosts with a little wealth are able to eat small amounts. The ghosts with great wealth also have three subgroups: the <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> sacrifices, who live off sacrifices offered by humans and are similar to spirits described in China; the <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> losses, who live off lost objects from the human world; and the <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> great powers, like yakshas and rakshasas, who are the powerful rulers <b>of</b> <b>ghosts.</b> The <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> sacrifices and losses sometimes suffer from hunger and thirst, whereas the <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> great powers have pleasures close to those of divine beings. Among hungry ghosts, however, most have little or no wealth and are extremely hungry.|$|R
