5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{represents}} {{the synthesis of}} masculine and feminine energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, <b>is</b> <b>inseparable</b> <b>from</b> (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God. The union of these principles is exalted as the root and womb of all creation. Another view is that Ardhanarishvara {{is a symbol of}} Shiva's all-pervasive nature.|$|E
5|$|Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935)—documenting the 1934 Nuremberg Rally—and Olympia (1938)—covering the 1936 Summer Olympics—pioneered {{techniques}} of camera movement and editing that influenced later films. New {{techniques such as}} telephoto lenses and cameras mounted on tracks were employed. Both films remain controversial, as their aesthetic merit <b>is</b> <b>inseparable</b> <b>from</b> their propagandising of National Socialist ideals.|$|E

All the {{constitutional}} conventions were held here, the seat of government again was here (in 1864–1882) and New Orleans was the center of dispute and organization in the struggle between political and ethnic blocks for the control of government.|$|E

He passed this attitude on to each of his five sons. Therefore, like {{his father and his}} brothers, Grace chose a professional career in medicine, though because of his cricketing commitments he did not complete his qualification as a doctor until 1879 when he was 31 years old.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{emigration}} of many film-makers and {{the political}} restrictions, the period was not without technical and aesthetic innovations, the introduction of Agfacolor film production being a notable example. Technical and aesthetic achievement could also be turned to the specific ends of the Nazi state, most spectacularly {{in the work of}} Leni Riefenstahl. Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935), documenting the 1934 Nuremberg Rally, and Olympia (1938), documenting the 1936 Summer Olympics, pioneered techniques of camera movement and editing that have influenced many later films. Both films, particularly Triumph of the Will, remain highly controversial, as their aesthetic merit <b>is</b> <b>inseparable</b> <b>from</b> their propagandising of Nazi ideals.|$|E
25|$|Webern's music, {{like that}} of both Brahms and Schoenberg, is marked by its {{emphasis}} on counterpoint and formal considerations; and Webern's commitment to systematic pitch organization in the twelve-tone method <b>is</b> <b>inseparable</b> <b>from</b> this prior commitment. Webern's tone rows are often arranged {{to take advantage of}} internal symmetries; for example, a twelve-tone row may be divisible into four groups of three pitches which are variations, such as inversions and retrogrades, of each other, thus creating invariance. This gives Webern's work considerable motivic unity, although this is often obscured by the fragmentation of the melodic lines. This fragmentation occurs through octave displacement (using intervals greater than an octave) and by moving the line rapidly from instrument to instrument in a technique referred to as Klangfarbenmelodie.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Nietzsche's {{greatest}} philosophical legacy lies in his 20th century interpreters, {{among them}} Pierre Klossowski, Martin Heidegger, Georges Bataille, Leo Strauss, Alexandre Kojève, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze (and Félix Guattari), Jacques Derrida and Albert Camus. Foucault's later writings, for example, adopt Nietzsche's genealogical method to develop anti-foundationalist theories {{of power that}} divide and fragment rather than unite politics (as evinced in the liberal tradition of political theory). The systematic institutionalisation of criminal delinquency, sexual identity and practice, and the mentally ill (to name but a few) are examples used to demonstrate how knowledge or truth <b>is</b> <b>inseparable</b> <b>from</b> the institutions that formulate notions of legitimacy from 'immoralities' such as homosexuality and the like (captured in the famous power-knowledge equation). Deleuze, arguably the foremost of Nietzsche's interpreters, used the much-maligned 'will to power' thesis in tandem with Marxian notions of commodity surplus and Freudian ideas of desire to articulate concepts such the rhizome and other 'outsides' to state power as traditionally conceived.|$|E

25|$|In Western cultures, {{predictors}} of happiness include elements that support personal independence, {{a sense of}} personal agency, and self-expression. In Eastern cultures, {{predictors of}} happiness focus on an interdependent self that <b>is</b> <b>inseparable</b> <b>from</b> significant others. Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how significant others appraise their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional experiences have a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example). There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving goals that are pleasing to or approved of by significant others compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that high self-esteem, {{a sense of personal}} control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures than they do in Eastern ones. However, {{this is not to say}} that these things are unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with high self-esteem and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture.|$|E

2500|$|A {{key part}} of most Pagan worldviews is the {{holistic}} concept of a universe that is interconnected. This is connected with a belief in either pantheism or panentheism.

2500|$|The {{practice}} of prayer had undergone very {{little change in}} the West from its origins until the 11th century, at which point a major change took place via the introduction of methods of meditation.
