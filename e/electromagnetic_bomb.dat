What Kittredge didn't count on is a tugboat captain, Lamont Dixon (Eddie Griffin), who survives an attack on his ship, and is soon recruited by an FBI agent (Vivica A. Fox) to infiltrate the oil rig and procure information about their plans, and if possible, stop them. In the process, Dixon meets an eager computer expert (Breckin Meyer) aboard the oil rig who helps Dixon even as he gets on his nerves and Lamont suspects he can't really trust him.|$|E

This thesis proposes hypothetical <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>bombs</b> (e-bomb) and classifies e-bombs into three isocategories depending on power sources. It also assesses the potential lethality effects on different targets based on a developed MATLAB Simulation Model. It also provides an understanding of the principles of High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) and High Power Microwave (HPM) Weapons. In addition, a measure of effectiveness model is proposed to compare the hypothetical e-bomb, HEMP and HPM weapons. The strategic effects on military affairs will be assessed. Finally, this study will help the Turkish Armed Forces decide on investment in e-bomb research and development (R&D) to improve combat capabilities in the future battlefield.

50|$|Air Force Officer Jack Tyree (Brian Bosworth) {{arrives at}} the cockpit (where Davis is held hostage) and overpowers one of Rogers' men, accidentally {{shooting}} the co-pilot in the process. He then helps fly the Concorde and later frees Davis. Later, another agent arrives and shoots Captain Roman and takes Tyree hostage. Having brought with them two pairs of parachutes, the men jump off the plane, after revealing {{that there was no}} nuclear device aboard the aircraft. The two men land and steal a car and escape along some cliffs. On the other hand, two French Secret Service Agents that have apparently overheard the hijacking, chase Rogers and his men down the road towards a pre-prepared road block. Rogers sets an <b>electromagnetic</b> pulse <b>bomb</b> to destroy the French car, until the officer at the roadblock fires a shell at the agents, causing them to skid off the road, violently roll down the cliffs and break up, killing Rogers and his men instantly.|$|R

After carrying out tests and experiments, investigating human disappearances caused as Viper feeds, they reach the conclusion that Viper is attracted to the uranium-contaminated town water system, where it has a concentrated point in an abandoned uranium mine. Connors orders an <b>electromagnetic</b> pulse <b>bomb,</b> though he encounters Viper {{at the police station}} and battles and kills Steve Elkins who revealed that he deliberately programmed Viper to kill humans and in doing so, rid himself of Bream and Stanton. Along with Burnham and a former suspicious sheriff Morgan, they successfully destroy Viper with the EMP bomb at the mine and escape unharmed, {{with the exception of the}} sheriff. Back at the NASA tracking facility, Connors, Burnham and the Secretary of Defense learn that the first prototype Viper aboard the shuttle Olympus re-enters atmosphere and crashed into the Pacific Ocean.|$|R
5000|$|After {{performing}} {{a number of}} tasks, such as destroying and capturing Strogg aircraft hangars and defense systems, [...] Kane and his remaining squad members {{make it to the}} USS Hannibal. There they are given their next mission: infiltrating one of the Strogg's central communication hubs, the Tetranode, with an <b>electromagnetic</b> pulse <b>bomb</b> in the hope that it will put the main Strogg Nexus in disarray. Kane is tasked with defending the mission convoy, which takes heavy casualties. After many setbacks, including the destruction of the EMP device by a Strogg ambush, Kane is left to complete the mission, assisted only by Private Johann Strauss and Lance Corporal Nikolai [...] "Sledge" [...] Slidjonovitch. Strauss figures out a way to destroy the core by shutting down its coolant systems. As Kane reaches the entrance to the Tetranode, however, he is greeted by two rocket-equipped network guardians, as well as the newly constructed Makron, which easily defeats Kane and knocks him unconscious.|$|R
5|$|The story, told {{through the}} use of voiced and {{animated}} comic panels, centers on Angel, a heroine in a post-apocalyptic United States that travels from town to town protecting helpless survivors of the war from attacking gangs. Angel defends the towns using Gypsy, the name given to her armored car equipped with mounted machine guns. The game uses an overhead view as the player speeds around a small town using Gypsy's machine guns to repel enemy gangs known as Wastelanders. There are three types of Wastelanders and each one unleashes attacks in a different manner: The Slavers class will attempt to capture the townspeople, Killers will only attack the player, and Duals can take on either the role of attacking or capturing during a raid. When enemies are killed, they leave behind weapons for the player such as napalm, land mines, or <b>Electromagnetic</b> pulse <b>bombs</b> (EMPs); or they drop upgrades which improve the car's weapons or armor. The EMPs are used to temporarily disable all the enemies on the screen while the napalm and land mines can be set between waves as traps for unsuspecting Wastelanders. One weapon upgrade offers players incendiary ammunition for the car's machine guns which makes it easier to destroy enemies by lighting them on fire.|$|R
40|$|A topological {{analysis}} {{of the structure of}} telecommunications networks is a very interesting topic in the network research, but also a key issue in their design and planning. Satisfying multiple criteria in terms of locations of switching nodes as well as their connectivity with respect to the requests for capacity, transmission speed, reliability, availability and cost are the main research objectives. There are three ways of presenting the topology of telecommunications networks: table, matrix or graph method. The table method is suitable for a network of {{a relatively small number of}} nodes in relation to the number of links. The matrix method involves the formation of a connection matrix in which its columns present source traffic nodes and its rows are the switching systems that belong to the destination. The method of the topology graph means that the network nodes are connected via directional or unidirectional links. We can thus easily analyze the structural parameters of telecommunications networks. This paper presents the mathematical {{analysis of}} the star-, ring-, fully connected loop- and grid (matrix) -shaped topology as well as the topology based on the shortest path tree. For each of these topologies, the expressions for determining the number of branches, the middle level of reliability, the medium length and the average length of the link are given in tables. For the fully connected loop network with five nodes the values of all topological parameters are calculated. Based on the topological parameters, the relationships that represent integral and distributed indicators of reliability are given in this work as well as the values of the particular network. The main objectives of the topology optimization of telecommunications networks are: achieving the minimum complexity, maximum capacity, the shortest path message transfer, the maximum speed of communication and maximum economy. The performance of telecommunications networks is analyzed in particular. Efficiency as an integral feature of reliability represents a measure of satisfying specific requirements of the mission (adequacy) over time (reliability) in a certain moment of time (availability). Today, modern telecommunications networks face another condition: the operation in extreme conditions (major floods, catastrophic earthquakes, forest fires, <b>electromagnetic</b> jamming and <b>bombing</b> from aircraft or remote control posts). In order to realize communication in such circumstances, it is necessary to introduce a new parameter - network survivability. The network survivability is defined as the ability of a network to maintain communication features while establishing, maintaining and terminating connections in extremely difficult conditions. This paper proposes a comprehensive definition of telecommunications networks including the network survivability as a very important factor. The best results in terms of network survivability are obtained by the network with full connection, but the drawback is its high implementation cost. The grid network is more favorable since it results in reducing the number of links between network nodes. With the number of branches increasing, the delay in the network also increases. The previous analysis shows that the average path length and the average length of links are critical values when selecting a configuration of functionally resistant telecommunications networks...|$|R
