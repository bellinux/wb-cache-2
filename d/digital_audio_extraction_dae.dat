50|$|The Jargon File {{entry for}} rip {{notes that the}} term {{originated}} in Amiga slang, where it referred to the extraction of multimedia content from program data. Another term used for the process of ripping Audio-CDs is <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Extraction</b> (<b>DAE).</b>|$|E
50|$|To rip {{contents}} is also {{different from}} grabbing an analog signal and re-encoding it, {{as it was}} done with early day CD-ROM drives not capable of <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>extraction</b> (<b>DAE).</b> Sometimes even encoding, i.e. digitizing audio and video originally stored on analog formats, such as vinyl records is incorrectly referred to as ripping.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1990s, CD-ROM {{and related}} <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Extraction</b> (<b>DAE)</b> {{technology}} introduced the term sector {{to refer to}} each timecode frame, with each sector being identified by a sequential integer number starting at zero, and with tracks aligned on sector boundaries. An audio CD sector corresponds to 2,352 bytes of decoded data. The Red Book does not refer to sectors, nor does it distinguish the corresponding sections of the disc's data stream except as [...] "frames" [...] in the MSF addressing scheme.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{types of}} {{protection}} existed. While basically {{intended as a}} means of copy-protecting compact discs, Copy Control discs cannot properly be referred to as CDs because the system introduces incompatible data, making the discs non-compliant with the Red Book standard for audio CDs. The system is intended to prevent <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>extraction</b> ("ripping") from the protected discs, and thus limit the file sharing of ripped music. The techniques used are: ...|$|R
50|$|CDex {{is a free}} {{software}} for <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Extraction</b> from <b>Audio</b> CD (a so-called CD ripper) and audio format conversion for Microsoft Windows. It converts CDDA tracks from a CD to standard computer sound files, such as WAV, MP3, or Ogg Vorbis. Released {{under the terms of}} the GNU General Public License (GPL), CDex is {{free software}}. It is developed and maintained by Georgy Berdyshev. It was originally written by Albert L. Faber.|$|R
50|$|In {{a process}} called ripping, <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>extraction</b> {{software}} {{can be used to}} read CD-DA audio data and store it in files. Common audio file formats for this purpose include WAV and AIFF, which simply preface the LPCM data with a short header; FLAC, ALAC, and Windows Media Audio Lossless, which compress the LPCM data in ways that conserve space yet allow it to be restored without any changes; and various lossy, perceptual coding formats like MP3 and AAC, which modify and compress the audio data in ways that irreversibly change the audio, but that exploit features of human hearing to make the changes difficult to discern.|$|R
5000|$|A {{newly created}} stereo mix of Smiley Smile was reissued by Capitol Records in 2012. Previously, the album {{had only been}} {{available}} in monaural and duophonic formats. <b>Digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>extraction</b> processes were used for tracks whose original master tapes had been lost, such as [...] "Good Vibrations". When The Smile Sessions box set was released in 2011, co-producer Mark Linett acknowledged that [...] "there's things that some people think - should Smiley Smile sessions be there - tracks such as 'Can't Wait Too Long', we get into a very fuzzy area." [...] In 2017, session highlights from the album were released {{for the first time}} on the rarities compilation 1967 - Sunshine Tomorrow.|$|R
50|$|In {{the context}} of <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>extraction</b> from compact discs, seek jitter causes {{extracted}} audio samples to be doubled-up or skipped entirely if the Compact Disc drive re-seeks. The problem occurs because the Red Book does not require block-accurate addressing during seeking. As a result, the extraction process may restart a few samples early or late, resulting in doubled or omitted samples. These glitches often sound like tiny repeating clicks during playback. A successful approach to correction in software involves performing overlapping reads and fitting the data to find overlaps at the edges. Most extraction programs perform seek jitter correction. CD manufacturers avoid seek jitter by extracting the entire disc in one continuous read operation, using special CD drive models at slower speeds so the drive does not re-seek.|$|R

2500|$|Heitaro Nakajima, who {{developed}} an early <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> recorder within Japan's national public broadcasting organization NHK in 1970, became {{general manager of}} Sony's audio department in 1971. His team developed a <b>digital</b> PCM adaptor <b>audio</b> tape recorder using a Betamax video recorder in 1973. After this, in 1974 the leap to storing <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> on an optical disc was easily made. Sony first publicly demonstrated an optical <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> disc in September 1976. A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a 30cm disc that could play 60 minutes of <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> (44,100Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution) using MFM modulation. In September 1978, the company demonstrated an optical <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> disc with a 150-minute playing time, 44,056Hz sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, and cross-interleaved error correction code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard compact disc format in 1980. Technical details of Sony's <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> disc were presented during the 62nd AES Convention, held on 13–16 March 1979, in Brussels.
