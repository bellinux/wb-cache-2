40|$|Problem statement: <b>Flows</b> <b>of</b> continuous-time {{dynamical}} {{systems with}} {{the same number of}} equilibrium points and trajectories, and which has no periodic orbit form an equivalence class under the topological conjugacy relation. Approach: Arbitrarily, two trajectories resulting from two distinct <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> this type of dynamical systems were written as a set of points (orbit). A homeomorphism which maps between these two sets is then built. Using the notion of topological conjugacy, they were shown to conjugate topologically. By the arbitrariness in selection <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> and their respective initial states, the results were extended to all the <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> dynamical system of that type. Results: Any two <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> such dynamical systems were shown to share the same dynamics temporally along with other properties such as order isomorphic and homeomorphic. Conclusion: Topological conjugacy serves as an equivalence relation in the set <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> continuous-time dynamical systems which have same number of equilibrium points and trajectories, and has no periodic orbit. </P...|$|R
