25|$|This {{distribution}} can {{be illustrated}} as an urn model with bias. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We {{will say that}} the odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now we are taking n balls, one by one, {{in such a way that}} the probability of taking a particular ball at a particular draw is equal to its proportion of the total weight of all balls that lie in the urn at that moment. The number of red balls x1 that we <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> experiment is a random variable with Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution.|$|E
500|$|In {{developing}} the Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP), an , Wheeler used a variant on Twenty Questions, called Negative Twenty Questions, {{to show how}} the questions we choose to ask about the universe may dictate the answers we <b>get.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> variant, the respondent does not choose or decide upon any particular or definite object beforehand, but only on a pattern of [...] "Yes" [...] or [...] "No" [...] answers. This variant requires the respondent to provide a consistent set of answers to successive questions, so that each answer can be viewed as logically compatible with all the previous answers. In this way, successive questions narrow the options until the questioner settles upon a definite object. Wheeler's theory was that, in an analogous manner, consciousness may play some role in bringing the universe into existence.|$|E
