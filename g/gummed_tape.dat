50|$|A {{specific}} type of <b>gummed</b> <b>tape</b> is called reinforced <b>gummed</b> <b>tape</b> (RGT). The backing of this reinforced tape consists of two layers of paper with a cross-pattern of fiberglass filaments laminated between. The laminating adhesive had previously been asphalt but now is more commonly a hot-melt atactic polypropylene.|$|E

50|$|Starch from {{waxy maize}} differs from regular maize starch in both {{molecular}} structure and pasting characteristics. Pastes made from waxy starch {{are long and}} cohesive, whereas pastes made from regular maize starch are short and heavy bodied. Waxy maize starch is a major starch component in adhesives used for making bottle labels. This waxy starch-based adhesive imparts resolubilizing resistance to the labels which prevents their soaking off the bottle if immersed in water or being subjected to very high humidity conditions. Moreover, waxy maize starches are commonly used in the US for the manufacture of <b>gummed</b> <b>tapes</b> and envelope adhesives.|$|R

5000|$|Baling wire is {{sometimes}} {{used in an}} informal, make-do manner as an easy fix. It is frequently referred to {{as one of the}} basic repair materials. Typical uses range from supporting loose mufflers to patching chain-link fences. Common phrases often include baling wire as an ad hoc, fix-anything material, alongside chewing <b>gum,</b> duct <b>tape,</b> and the cable tie.|$|R
5000|$|Gummed (water activated) tape {{dispensers}} measure, dispense, moisten, and cut gummed or water-activated adhesive tape. This tape {{is often}} {{composed of a}} paper backing and adhesive glue that is unable to adhere until it is [...] "activated" [...] by contact with water. To perform this step, gummed dispensers often employ a water bottle and wetting brush to moisten each piece of tape as it is dispensed. Many gummed dispensers feature a heater, which is mounted over the feed area to maintain the dispenser’s water temperature. These heaters ensure maximum wetting, and are ideal in cold climates. <b>Gummed</b> <b>tape</b> dispensers are often used in packaging or shipping departments for closing corrugated boxes.|$|E
50|$|Marquetry as {{a modern}} craft most {{commonly}} uses knife-cut veneers. However, the knife-cutting technique usually {{requires a lot of}} time. For that reason, many marquetarians have switched to fret or scroll saw techniques. Other requirements are a pattern of some kind, some brown <b>gummed</b> <b>tape</b> (IE as the moistened glue dries it causes the tape to shrink and so the veneer pieces are pulled closer together), PVA glue and a base-board with balancing veneers on the alternate face to compensate stresses. Finishing the piece will require fine abrasive paper always backed by a sanding block. Either ordinary varnish, special varnishes, modern polyurethane -oil or water based- good waxes and even the technique of french polish are different methods used to seal and finish the piece.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{on developing}} a synthesis method of paste-glue production for <b>gummed</b> <b>tape</b> using a corn-based starch {{as an alternative}} feedstock from laboratory-scale to pilot-scale and to near commercial scale. Basically, two methods of synthesis were developed to produce paste-glue in laboratory scale. Based on the two methods, we then scale-up the earlier laboratory scale data to pilot-scale and near commercial-scale for developing a large scale process production of paste-glue. Scaling up production from 1, 000 ml reactor to 500 L pilot-scale reactor and 1, 500 L near commercial scale reactor, we monitored pathway of temperature increase during reaction as well as adjustment of operating condition conducted for laboratory experimental data {{in order to produce}} a good quality of paste-glue. Some scaling up parameters have been found as well as critical parameters for a good product quality such as viscosity and ceiling temperature of the reaction which are very crucial in order to give optimum operating condition. We have selected synthesis method of paste-glue production and found the range of the parameters in order to produce a very good quality of paste-glue in pilot scale and near commercial scale...|$|E

5000|$|Compared to {{most other}} {{electrical}} and utility tapes, centerline tape {{is not particularly}} tough mechanically. Silicone rubber feels soft and is also susceptible to cuts and abrasion, having low tear resistance. This weakness is made worse because this tape is wrapped while stretched, and remains under internal tension even while fused, so that any nicks or cuts may start to tear and expand without additional external tension. [...] However, these same properties, combined {{with the lack of}} traditional <b>gum</b> adhesive, make <b>tape</b> removal, if needed, quick, clean, and easy.|$|R
500|$|Sinclair {{released}} {{only two}} official peripherals for the ZX81, a 16KB RAM pack (actually {{the same one}} previously released for the ZX80, but rebadged) and the ZX Printer, both of which plugged into the edge connector {{at the rear of}} the ZX81. They retailed at a launch price of £49.95 each but both had notable flaws. The RAM pack was top-heavy and was supported only by the edge connector. It had a habit of falling out of its socket at crucial points and crashing the ZX81, losing anything that the user had typed in. Users turned to using sticky lumps of chewing <b>gum,</b> double-sided <b>tape</b> or Blu-Tack to cure what became known as the [...] "RAM pack wobble" [...] problem. The ZX Printer was a tiny spark printer that used two electrically charged styli to burn away the surface of aluminium-coated paper to reveal the black underlay. It worked reasonably well at first but its output deteriorated rapidly after a time.|$|R
40|$|Costume {{mounting}} for {{an exhibition}} varies between museums and countries. Different mounting techniques {{can be used}} {{depending on how the}} object is to be presented. The most commonly used display form is a visible mannequin that shows head, arms and legs and creates an illusion of a human being. Another type of display form has become increasingly popular. A cut-out mannequin shows the human form but the mount is invisible. This mounting form displays the object in focus. There are many aspects to consider when a threedimensional textile is to be displayed in an exhibition, which materials are safe to use and what kind of display form is best for the object, the duration of the exhibition and what climate is optimal for the objects. This thesis explains and describes the mounting materials Fosshape™, <b>gummed</b> paper <b>tape</b> and mounting with plastic sheets such as the polycarbonate Lexan* and the co-polyester Vivak®. These materials were used to create cut-out mannequins for three swimsuits from the 1960 s. The cut-out mannequin gives the impression of a human body but without a visible form present and the swimsuits are to be {{the focal point of the}} mounts displayed. The materials used are presented and also how the mounting of these swimsuits were constructed. The mounts were then evaluated by the thesis author and people with museum competence, to determine if the mounts are indeed invisible. The result of the mounting of the three swimsuits shows that the mounting with <b>gummed</b> paper <b>tape</b> is an easy method to use but it takes time, especially for the mount to dry. To use Fosshape™ for a mount is a quick method and the mount gets a textile feel to it. Mounting with plastic sheets is more complicated especially with a three-dimensional textile with a lot of curves as the swimsuits. To mount a swimsuit I recommend using Fosshape™ but the other materials can also be used for costume mounting for an exhibition and this thesis describes one way of how to use them.

50|$|In 1924 Creed & Company, {{founded by}} Frederick G. Creed, entered the {{teleprinter}} field with their Model 1P, a page printer, which was soon superseded by the improved Model 2P. In 1925 Creed acquired the patents for Donald Murray's Murray code, a rationalised Baudot code. The Model 3 tape printer, Creed’s first combined start-stop machine, {{was introduced in}} 1927 for the Post office telegram service. This machine printed received messages directly on to <b>gummed</b> paper <b>tape</b> {{at a rate of}} 65 words per minute. Creed created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the Daily Mail for daily transmission of the newspaper contents. The Creed Model 7 page printing teleprinter was introduced in 1931 and was used for the inland Telex service. It worked at a speed of 50 baud, about 66 words a minute, using a code based on the Murray code.|$|R
