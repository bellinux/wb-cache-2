As described by Blatty, this new, updated edition features new and revised material.

First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable – plus one new character in a totally new very spooky scene. This is the version <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E

Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels. The famous encounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynic occurred during Alexander's stay in Corinth.

The Imperial Academy of Music and National Opera and the PedroII School were also founded, the latter serving as a model for schools throughout Brazil. The Imperial Academy of the Fine Arts, established by his father, received further strengthening and support. Using his civil list income, PedroII provided scholarships for Brazilian students to study at universities, art schools and conservatories of music in Europe. He also financed the creation of the Institute Pasteur, helped underwrite the construction of Wagner's Bayreuth Festspielhaus, as well as subscribing to similar projects. His efforts were recognized both at home and abroad. Charles Darwin said of him: [...] "The Emperor does so much for science, that every scientific man is bound to show him the utmost respect".|$|E

2500|$|Following Uro, Floberg starred {{opposite}} Trond Espen Seim in Bitre Blomster (2007). This was {{the first}} in a series of films based on Gunnar Staalesen's crime novels. As chief inspector Jakob Hamre, he serves as a foil for shabby private investigator Varg Veum (Seim). The film received mixed reviews, although most reviewers agreed that the two leads, particularly Seim, delivered good performances. Initially, a total of six films were produced, four of them intended for direct-to-video release. The second theatrically released film in the series was Falne Engler (2008), directed by Morten Tyldum, with Floberg and Seim reprising their roles as Veum and Hamre. The film was very well received, and shortly after the premiere, the producers announced that an additional six films based on Staalesen's Varg Veum character would be made. Bjørn Floberg expressed his satisfaction with the films: [...] " [...] have set a new standard for this genre, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of the continued development of the [...] universe, together with the script writers, and not least Trond Espen, with whom I've had a very good cooperation". Production of the new films were scheduled to begin in August 2009. In 2010 he played alongside Stellan Skarsgård in the Norwegian black comedy A Somewhat Gentle Man.|$|E

Madonna brought dance music into massive popularity in mainstream music scene, and it was similar to what Tsai would like to do in Greater China.
