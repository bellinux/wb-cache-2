40|$|Current {{manufacturing}} {{of precision}} tools for machining typically requires {{processes such as}} grinding, EDM or laser processing in order to comply with high requirements on tolerances. However even tools manufactured by these processes come short, when a new batch of workpieces are supplied, and their tolerances are not compliant. This approach presents a precision broaching tool for adjusting the inner diameter of an <b>external</b> <b>broach.</b> The tool compensates for the manufacturing tolerance chain of tool and workpieces by up to 37 [*]Î¼m. The approach is based on conventional shrink fitting of cold forging tools. A numerical and analytical model of the compression is compared with experimental results...|$|E
5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for <b>external</b> <b>broaching</b> the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBroaching is {{a highly}} {{efficient}} metal machining process in mass production. Parts with high quality requirements are manufactured by broaching, which can be influenced by different factors. One of them is vibration caused by process-machine-interactions. Such vibrations can easily be investigated with <b>external</b> <b>broaching,</b> where these vibrations result in varying process forces and wavily profiled machining surfaces. This paper presents a 2 D FEM-simulation approach for the prediction of surface rough-ness generated by broaching. In the simulation model, the solid machine structure that consists {{of a large number}} of machine parts is realized by using elements representing the stiffness and the dynamic properties of the machine structure. Thus, it is possible to avoid high calculation times. The broach is implemented as an elastic body and the resulting process forces are realized by an analytical model that considers the process parameters cutting thickness, cutting velocity and rake angle. These process parameters are calculated for each increment, which allows determining the resulting process forces and applying them onto the teeth. Finally, the presented simulation approach for the prediction of the surface roughness generated by broaching is validated by means of experiments. Broaches with different numbers of teeth are used for the experimental setup...|$|R
40|$|Broaching is a {{precision}} multipoint metal removal operation normally employed for manufacturing variety of complex parts having either internal or <b>external</b> features. <b>Broaching</b> can produce high precision and good surface finish {{at a high}} metal removal rate. The unique feature of a broach tool is that the feed/depth of cut for the teeth {{is built into the}} broach unlike other cutting tools. The tool design (e. g., rise per tooth and tooth geometry) {{play a vital role in}} the broach performance. A specially adapted machine tool modified to investigate a single broach tooth has been used. Cutting forces and material removal rate have been measured during experimental work for different combination of broaching parameters and broach tool geometry. The effect of the parameters on the surface quality produced has been established. The characteristics of chips formed have also been defined. Finally, optimum tooth geometry and rise per tooth have been recommended for tool performance, broached surface quality and efficient chip formation. The information provided in this paper will be beneficial for broach tool designers and manufacturing engineers...|$|R
