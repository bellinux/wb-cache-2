I feel the artist in me is dying and the dying is an agony... only one's self knows the craving and the best part in one is aching unsatisfied.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 1935, at Forbes Field, Babe Ruth hit {{the last}} three home runs of his career as his Boston Braves lost to the Pirates, 11-7. His last home run cleared the right field stands roofline, making him {{the first player to}} <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
5|$|On {{his trip}} to Germany, Ruisdael {{encountered}} water mills which he turned into a principal subject for painting, the first artist to <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> so. Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice, dated 1653, is a prime example. The ruins of Egmont Castle near Alkmaar were another favourite subject of Ruisdael's and feature in The Jewish Cemetery, of which he painted two versions. With these, Ruisdael pits the natural world against the built environment, which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Turner's {{painting}} achieved widespread critical acclaim, and accolades {{from the}} likes of John Ruskin and William Makepeace Thackeray. It was Turner's particular favourite; he only lent it once and refused to <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> so again. He also refused to sell it at any price, and on his death bequeathed it to the nation. It hangs today in the National Gallery, and in 2005 it was voted the nation's favourite painting in a poll organized by BBC Radio 4's Today programme.|$|E
5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

25|$|This {{raises the}} {{question}} why does an employer <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> {{more than it is}} legally obliged to do ? One theory seeking to explain this behaviour is that employment {{is an example of a}} relational contract, based upon a relationship of trust between the parties. The explicit terms of the contract are just an outline as there are implicit terms and understandings which determine the behaviour of the parties. The High Court has long held there is a distinction between the employment relationship and the contract of employment.|$|E

25|$|On August 23, in his 115th game of {{the season}} Joc Pederson of the Albuquerque Isotopes became the first player in the Pacific Coast League in 80 years (since Frank Demaree in 1934, in 186 games), and the fourth all-time, to hit 30 homers and steal 30 bases in the same season. The only other Pacific Coast League hitters to do it were Lefty O'Doul (1927, in 189 games) and Hall of Famer Tony Lazzeri (1925, in 197 games). He was also only the second Dodger minor leaguer to <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> it, joining Chin-Feng Chen (1999; 31/31 for Class A San Bernardino). Pederson was also named the Most Valuable Player of the PCL.|$|E
25|$|Several {{underlying}} {{themes were}} apparent throughout the show's run. For the characters, {{working at the}} camp was either a step up or step down the ladder of success in show-business. The younger staff (e.g. Spike Dixon and the Yellowcoats) were keen and enthusiastic about their jobs, which they saw as a lucky break {{at the start of}} their careers. For the older members of the staff (e.g. Yvonne, Barry and Mr Partridge), the camp was a step down from past glories. Caught in the middle were staff members close to middle age (e.g. Ted Bovis and Fred Quilley) who still believed they could achieve fame and fortune, and were reluctant to accept that working at a holiday camp was the best they would <b>ever</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
25|$|While the Queensland rugby league team's players mostly {{come from}} Queensland, up until 1980 when {{residential}} selection criteria were still used, some of New South Wales' most prominent footballers, such as Dally Messenger and Clive Churchill, also {{played for the}} Maroons. Queensland's players {{are some of the}} most famous athletes Australia produces, with goal-kicking centre Mal Meninga being named the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 1990, the first rugby league player to <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> so. Since the turn of the century Maroons players have become big name footballers not only in rugby league but in other codes as well. Rugby union's 2003 World Cup Final alone featured four former Queensland players: Brad Thorn playing for the All Blacks, and Mat Rogers, Lote Tuqiri and Wendell Sailor playing for the Wallabies. Former Maroons Karmichael Hunt and Israel Folau were both recruited by the AFL to play Australian rules football (and both also currently play professional rugby union).|$|E

25|$|Slaton and the Mountaineers {{clinched}} the 2007 Big East Championship with a 66-21 win over #20 Connecticut. Slaton had a sub-par performance, rushing for 54 yards and 2 touchdowns on ten carries and grabbing two receptions for 11 yards. However, he surpassed 1,000 {{yards on the}} season on a 31-yard touchdown run {{for the third straight}} year; and by him surpassing 1,000 yards on the season, Slaton and Patrick White both surpassed 1,000 yards rushing for the second consecutive season, a feat that made them only the third pair in FBS history to <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> so. The next week however, the #2 Mountaineers fell to 5–7 Pitt in the Backyard Brawl 13-9 to end their National Championship hopes. In the loss, Slaton only carried the ball nine times for eleven yards. Slaton was named to second-team all-Big East and was also awarded the team's Coaches Contribution Award by former head coach Rich Rodriguez.|$|E
25|$|Pederson homered in both {{games of}} a day-night doubleheader on June 2, {{with his second}} homer being {{estimated}} at 480 feet, the longest in the Majors at that point of the season. On June 3, he homered in his fifth consecutive game, becoming the first Dodgers rookie to <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> so. That also tied the team record, with Pederson joining Roy Campanella (1950), Shawn Green (2001), Matt Kemp (2010), and Adrian Gonzalez (2014–15). Coupled with his four-game home run streak in May, he became only the second rookie {{in the modern era}} to have two home run streaks of at least four games (joining Minnesota's Jimmie Hall; 1963). Pederson hit his 19th home run on June 22, passing Mike Piazza (1993) for most home runs by a Dodgers rookie before the All-Star break. He hit his 20th on June 29, making him one of only three rookies in MLB history to hit 20 or more homers before July, joining Wally Berger (1930) and Albert Pujols (2001).|$|E
25|$|On 3 April 2016, Djokovic won the 2016 Miami Open for {{the third}} {{consecutive}} year, and did so without dropping a set en route to his sixth career Miami Open title, tying him with Andre Agassi for most ever Miami Open men's singles titles. In addition, 2016 marked the third consecutive year that Djokovic swept both Indian Wells and the Miami Open, the first male singles player to <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> that. This was also the fourth time in his career Djokovic won both Miami and Indian Wells back-to-back. His finals win in Miami saw Djokovic surpass Roger Federer to become the all-time leading prize money winner on the ATP tour with career earnings of $98.2million. After an early round exit at the Monte Carlo Masters, Djokovic quickly bounced back by winning the Madrid title {{for the second time in}} his career with a three set victory over Murray. They met again in the Rome Masters final one week later with Murray the victor, despite a sluggish performance, Djokovic defeated Nadal and Nishikori in two long quarterfinals and semi-finals.|$|E
