5|$|Smith faced eleven {{other athletes}} {{during the final}} <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women's Olympic triple jump event. The Jamaican jumped 14.12meters, placing 11th. China's Xie Limei ranked {{directly}} behind Smith (14.09meters), while Estonia's Leibak ranked ahead (14.13meters). The leaders of the heat included gold medalist Francoise Mbango Etone of Cameroon (15.39meters), silver medalist Lebedeva (15.32meters), and bronze medalist Devetzi (15.23meters).|$|E
5|$|Tall eucalypts {{that are}} {{emergent}} over other trees in wooded areas are selected for roosting sites. It {{is here that}} the cockatoos rest for the night, and also rest to shelter from the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. They often socialise before dusk, engaging in preening, feeding young, and flying acrobatically. Flocks will return to roost earlier in bad weather.|$|E

However, overall, Danielle Beaubrun ranked forty-second, and, as a result, did not advance.|$|E
5|$|White roofs: Painting rooftops {{white has}} become a common {{strategy}} to reduce the heat island effect. In cities, there are many dark colored surfaces that absorb the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun in turn lowering the albedo of the city. White rooftops allow high solar reflectance and high solar emittance, increasing the albedo of the city or area the effect is occurring.|$|E
5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
25|$|Lim first {{competed for}} Singapore at the 2007 Hong Kong International Open, where, aged just 14, she {{finished}} 7th in <b>the</b> <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 50 metre freestyle in 27.94, 7th in <b>the</b> <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 100 metre freestyle in 1:00.17, 7th in <b>the</b> <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 200 metre freestyle in 2:12.35 and {{withdrew from the}} 400 metre freestyle. She was denied {{a place in the}} final in these events as the rules for the meet stipulated that <b>the</b> maximum number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competitors from each country was limited to two. Lim also swam in <b>the</b> <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay with Mylene Ong, Ruth Ho and Lynette Lim, setting the fastest qualifying time <b>of</b> 4:06.03.

5|$|Arriving in Brisbane for the Commonwealth Games, Brooks {{and some}} of his fellow sprinters shaved their heads, {{something}} that received much attention from the Australian public. He won his <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 100m freestyle in a Commonwealth and Commonwealth Games record of 51.09s. He swam slower in the final, but his time of 51.14s was enough to secure the gold medal in a close contest. Just 0.43s separated him and the bronze and silver medallists Greg Fasala and Michael Delany, both of Australia.|$|E
5|$|As {{the torch}} bearer {{approaches}} the Olympic Stadium he collapses, and the Doctor promptly and suddenly appears, {{picks up the}} torch, and completes the run to light the Olympic Flame. The <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flame and the emotion of the crowd power the pod, allowing the Isolus to leave Chloe and return home. The Doctor and Rose walk off to watch the games, and Rose remarks that nothing will ever split {{the two of them}} up. The Doctor becomes uneasy and muses that a storm is approaching.|$|E
5|$|Asafa Powell was 25 at {{the time}} he {{represented}} Jamaica in the men's 100meters race at the Beijing Olympics. Born in Linstead, a small town to the northwest of Kingston, and the brother of fellow Olympian Donovan Powell, Asafa Powell had participated earlier in the 2004 Athens Olympics while 21 years old. He took part in the men's 100meters and men's 200meters races. Powell competed in the second <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> August 14 qualifications, placing first with a time of 10.16seconds. Kim Collins of Saint Kitts and Nevis placed second in the heat (10.17seconds) and Great Britain's Craig Pickering placed third (10.21seconds). Overall, Powell place third out of 80 athletes a millisecond behind fellow Jamaican Michael Frater. He progressed to quarterfinals.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E
5|$|At war's end, Kent Hughes entered Christ Church, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, {{gaining a}} Bachelor of Arts with Honours in Modern History. He also captained the Oxford ski team and showed a {{proficiency}} for athletics, such that Kent Hughes {{was chosen to}} represent Australia in the 110 and 400 metre hurdles at the 1920 Summer Olympics. He finished fourth in his <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 110 metre hurdles and failed to progress but won his 400-metre heat before finishing fifth in the semi final. Kent Hughes {{did not return to}} England empty handed, as he later admitted to souveniring an official Olympic flag from the Olympic stadium.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus fled in the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle. One {{half of the}} Roman fleet was burned, sunk, or captured, and {{the other}} half {{followed}} the fugitive Basiliscus. The whole expedition had failed. Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert into Tripolitania, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he was reached by Basiliscus; the general was, however, assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves would remove from the world his most formidable antagonists.|$|E

With a time of 13.44seconds, Brathwaite ranked second in the event behind Jamaica's Maurice Wignall (13.36seconds) and ahead of Villar, who led Brathwaite's qualification heat (13.46seconds). The quarterfinal round included 32 advancing athletes, and 30 of those competitors finished their races. Of those, Brathwaite ranked tenth. He again advanced, this time to the semifinal round.|$|E
5|$|Calgary {{ended the}} {{exhibition}} season with several injuries to key players. Centre Daymond Langkow remained sidelined following a neck injury suffered the previous season, while Ryan Stone (knee) was also out. Matt Stajan suffered a shoulder separation, David Moss also suffered {{a shoulder injury}} and Ales Kotalik was lost to a knee injury. As {{a result of the}} injuries, the Flames signed centre Brendan Morrison to a contract; Morrison had been in training camp with the Canucks before being released. Rookie defenceman T. J. Brodie proved the surprise player of training camp. Expected to start the year with the Abbotsford <b>Heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Hockey League (AHL), Brodie impressed the Flames' coaching staff and earned a position on the team to begin the NHL season.|$|E
5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E
