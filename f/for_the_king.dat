These show that Henry bought part or all of 40 ships and paid out a year's wages for over a thousand sailors for the expedition. The total expenses for Henry's efforts totalled over 5,000 pounds.|$|E

Besides controlling Stafford Castle, Pantulf mediated between Henry {{and some of the}} Welsh princes, who had previously sided with Robert, and helped secure their support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>king.</b> Later Pantulf again acted as an envoy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>king,</b> being sent to secure the switch of sides of Robert's men who were holding Bridgnorth. Pantulf won their change of sides by offering the men lands worth a 100 pounds on the king's behalf.
