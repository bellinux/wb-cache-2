40|$|Increases in {{ridership}} are outpacing capacity expansions in {{a number}} of transit systems. By shifting their focus to demand management, agencies can instead influence how customers use the system, getting more out of the capacity they already have. However, while demand management is well researched for personal vehicle use, its applications for public transportation are still emerging. This thesis explores the strategies transit agencies can use to reduce overcrowding, with a particular focus of how automatically collected fare data can support the design and evaluation of these measures. A framework for developing demand management policies is introduced to help guide agencies through this process. It includes establishing motivations for the program, aspects to consider in its design, as well as dimensions and metrics to evaluate its impacts. Additional considerations for updating a policy are also discussed, as are the possible data sources and methods for supporting analysis. This framework was applied to a <b>fare</b> <b>incentive</b> strategy implemented at Hong Kong's MTR system. In addition to establishing existing congestion patterns, a customer classification analysis was performed to understand the typical travel patterns among MTR users. These results were used to evaluate the promotion at three levels of customer aggregation: all users, user groups, and a panel of high frequency travelers. The incentive was found to have small but non-negligible impacts on morning travel, particularly {{at the beginning of the}} peak hour and among users with commuter-like behavior. Through a change point analysis, it was possible to identify the panel members that responded to the promotion and quantify factors that influenced their decision using a discrete choice model. The findings of these analyses are used to recommend potential improvements to MTR's current scheme. by Anne Halvorsen. Thesis: S.

40|$|This thesis explores and {{evaluates the}} {{essential}} strategies needed for transit agencies {{to switch from}} traditional fare collection systems to smart cards. More transit agencies today are investing in smart card technology {{as part of their}} new automated fare collection (AFC) systems. Although the benefits of switching to smart card systems have been well-researched and acknowledged by transit agencies, it is unclear how a transit agency should go about implementing a smart card system in order to achieve optimum customer acceptance and to reap maximum benefits from the system. Recent experience has shown that a range of implementation policy decisions {{can go a long way}} towards speeding or slowing down the adoption of the technology by customers. A case study approach is used here to identify and evaluate the effectiveness and impacts of policies used by five transit agencies that currently employ smart cards. These policies fall into two categories: 1) distribution, operational and usage policies, and 2) fare policies. Distribution, operational and usage policies must be designed to facilitate and enhance customer adoption of smart cards, especially in the case where alternative fare media will co-exist. (cont.) Fare policies are designed to differentiate smart cards from other fare media through differential pricing strategies, frequent-use bonuses and low price guarantees. The thesis also examines the use of fare models in assisting transit agencies to predict ridership and revenue, especially focusing on the features needed in these models to predict the usage rates of smart cards and their associated unique fare options. Finally, the findings from the research are integrated and used to develop a set of guidelines for use by a transit agency that is switching to a smart card fare payment system. The main topics of these guidelines were identified as: 1) the use of <b>fare</b> policy <b>incentives,</b> 2) balance between restrictions and alternatives with respect to co-existing fare media, 3) accessibility to smart card support services, 4) capitalizing on the superiority of smart card technology, and 5) the use of a single card. To illustrate the usefulness of the guidelines, they were applied to a case study of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) 's new AFC program, the CharlieCard. by Yi Hong. Thesis (S.
