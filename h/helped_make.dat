Thornton agreed to let his talented younger brother {{continue}} his education, a sacrifice that Hobey Baker never forgot.

5|$|During the off-season, Brulé {{worked with}} a sports {{psychologist}} to address the mental aspect of his game, including his confidence. Near {{the end of the}} Oilers' training camp, on October 2, 2011, he was placed on waivers for the purpose of being assigned to the team's AHL affiliate, the Oklahoma City Barons. While the departure of Andrew Cogliano in July 2011 made room for Brulé to move up the Oilers' depth chart at centre, the performance of Oilers rookies Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Anton Lander <b>helped</b> <b>make</b> him expendable. Regarding the move, Oilers General Manager Steve Tambellini described Brulé as having lacked consistency. Brulé cleared waivers two days later; an Edmonton Sun article suggested that he would have likely been picked up by another team if not for his $1.85 million salary.|$|E
5|$|Indiana quarterback John Paci was the {{cornerstone}} of Indiana's offense, and completed 133 of 258passes for 1,796yards and eighttouchdowns during the regular season. During the team's regular-season game against Penn State, Paci completed the longest passing play in Indiana history, completing a 99-yard pass to wide receiver Thomas Lewis for a touchdown. That play in part <b>helped</b> <b>make</b> Paci's performance against Penn State the fourth-highest single-game passing total for an Indiana quarterback in school history. Paci suffered a separated shoulder during the regular season, but despite the injury, he was predicted to start at quarterback against Virginia Tech and undergo surgery following the Independence Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian {{quickly turned}} things around in 1964, re-establishing {{a sense of}} {{confidence}} and team spirit that had been lost under Kuharich and Devore. Practices were carefully planned and organized {{with the help of}} a coaching staff that consisted of three assistants from Northwestern and four former Notre Dame players. Parseghian listened to players' concerns about the program and addressed them. He updated the team's offense by favoring passing and bringing in smaller and quicker players. A rule change allowing unlimited substitutions starting in 1964 <b>helped</b> <b>make</b> this strategy successful; fast-running receivers could now be taken out of the game and rested as others replaced them.|$|E
