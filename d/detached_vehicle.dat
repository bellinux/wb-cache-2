50|$|Civil {{enforcement}} officers (England, Wales, Scotland), including those previously known as parking attendants (whose duties {{might still be}} limited to parking contraventions or might now be extended to other road traffic contraventions where a local authority has chosen to do so), are employed by local authorities or a contractor providing their services to a local authority. Since the advent of decriminalised parking enforcement, they have largely replaced traffic wardens as the primary enforcers of parking regulations. They {{have the power to}} issue penalty charge notices (PCNs) for parking contraventions dealt with by ss.63-79 Road Traffic Act 1991; in areas where their duties have been extended beyond that of a parking attendant they can also issue PCNs for parking offences coming under other legislation such as e.g. parking a vehicle entirely on a footway or the parking of a <b>detached</b> <b>vehicle</b> trailer or skip.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to use train integrity supervision, or by accepting limited speed and traffic volume to lessen the effect and probability of colliding with <b>detached</b> rail <b>vehicles.</b> ERTMS Regional has lower commissioning and maintenance costs, since trackside train detection devices are not routinely used, and is suitable for lines with low traffic volume. These low-density lines usually have no automatic train protection system today, and thus {{will benefit from the}} added safety.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: CGI {{image of}} human torpedo: British Mk 1 [...] "chariot" [...] ridden by two frogmen with UBA rebreathers. The warhead is <b>detached</b> from the <b>vehicle</b> for {{placement}} upon or under a ship, allowing the operators {{to use the}} machine for escape.|$|R
50|$|Goat {{provided}} a similar frame of explosives to Onion and Carrot, but carried horizontally {{to allow a}} much greater charge to be carried. This was released by prongs extending from the front, allowing it to pivot into a vertical position before <b>detaching</b> from the <b>vehicle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{test flight}} {{took place on}} June 28, 2014, with the test vehicle {{launching}} from the United States Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauaʻi, Hawaiʻi, at 18:45 UTC (08:45 local). A high-altitude helium balloon, which when fully inflated has a volume of , lifted the vehicle to around 120000 ft. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>detached</b> at 21:05 UTC (11:05 local), and four small, solid-fuel rocket motors spun up the vehicle to provide stability.|$|R
5000|$|The case {{concerned}} {{an action}} for damages. Diemont J determined that, if {{part of the}} mechanism or the equipment or the accessories to a motor <b>vehicle</b> become <b>detached</b> while the <b>vehicle</b> is being driven and cause injury to a third party, the injury [...] "arises out of" [...] the driving of the vehicle, {{within the meaning of}} that phrase in section 11(1) of the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act.|$|R
50|$|As Glenn Seton leapt off the line, chaos ensued behind. Skaife, Longhurst and Garnder tangled {{down the}} pack, which sent Skaife and Longhurst {{off into the}} infield. In a bizarre incident, Kevin Waldock's rear right wheel caught fire and <b>detached</b> from the <b>vehicle.</b> Brock passed Bowe for second and {{pressured}} Seton {{all the way to}} line, although this would prove to be not enough. Seton would win, with Brock in second and Johnson in third.|$|R
50|$|The {{approach}} railways {{were now}} complete, but considerable volumes of bad publicity {{resulted from the}} inadequate state of Edinburgh Waverley station. Many trains now attached and <b>detached</b> portions and <b>vehicles</b> in the station, and the track layout and platform accommodation was grossly inadequate. The NBR's partners in the Forth Bridge Company had, like the NBR itself, invested vast sums {{of money in the}} bridge, and they were dismayed to see the critical press coverage now that their investment had at last been completed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most severe}} {{happened}} in 2003: an entire 11th grade class of 21 {{students from the}} village of Makrochori (Prefecture of Imathia) perished when a truck carrying plywood, coming from the opposite direction, hit their bus on its side. Although the driver was able to reduce the truck's velocity in just a few seconds, sideways momentum was conserved by the plywood which <b>detached</b> from the <b>vehicle</b> and sliced into {{the left side of the}} coach, instantly killing many of the passengers.|$|R
5000|$|In this universe, Optimus Prime {{transforms}} into a fire engine. The {{front section}} of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>detaches</b> and becomes Prime himself, armed with [...] "Blaze Blaster" [...] cannons. To attack, {{he is able to}} use his headlights, known as the [...] "Fire Flash" [...] attack, and leg wheels, known as the [...] "Gyro-Strike". The rest of the vehicle transforms into a mobile battle station/refueling port/communications array and can combine with Prime as additional weapons and armor, forming his super mode referred to as [...] "Super Fire Convoy". The ladder/hose section houses Prime's Power Stream water cannon, capable of shooting freezing streams of water, called his Blizzard Storm attack. It also contains a quartet of rocket launchers. In super mode, his feet contain missile launchers than can mount to the shoulders of his regular robot mode. In this mode, he can fire his fists for his [...] "Flying Fist" [...] attack.|$|R
50|$|The bridge layer unfolds and {{launches}} its cargo, {{providing a}} ready-made {{bridge across the}} obstacle in only minutes. Once the span has been put in place, the AVLB <b>vehicle</b> <b>detaches</b> from the bridge, and moves aside to allow traffic to pass. Once all of the vehicles have crossed, it crosses the bridge itself and reattaches to the bridge on the other side. It then retracts the span ready to move off again. A similar procedure can be employed to allow crossings of small chasms or similar obstructions. AVLBs can carry bridges of 60 feet (19 metres) or greater in length. By using a tank chassis, the bridge layer is able to cover the same terrain as main battle tanks, {{and the provision of}} armour allows them to operate {{even in the face of}} enemy fire. However, this is not a universal attribute: some exceptionally sturdy 6x6 or 8x8 truck chassis have lent themselves to bridge-layer applications.|$|R
5000|$|ULA plans an [...] "incremental approach" [...] to {{rolling out}} {{the vehicle and}} its technologies. Deployment will begin with the first stage, based on the Delta IV's {{fuselage}} and expected to use two BE-4 engines. Aerojet Rocketdyne's AR-1 engine is retained as a contingency option, with a final decision {{to be made in}} 2016. The first stage can have from one to six solid rocket boosters (SRBs), and in the maximal configuration could launch a heavier payload than the highest-rated Atlas V, though still less than the Delta IV Heavy. A later development will be a partly reusable first stage, in which the engines <b>detach</b> from the <b>vehicle</b> after cutoff, descend with a heat shield and parachute, and finally are captured by a helicopter in mid-air. ULA calculates that reusing the engines could reduce the cost of the first stage propulsion by 90%, with propulsion being 65% of the total first stage build cost.|$|R
5000|$|ULA {{is taking}} an [...] "incremental approach" [...] to rolling out {{the vehicle and}} its technologies. Vulcan {{deployment}} will begin with the first stage, based on the Delta IV's fuselage diameter and production process {{and is expected to}} use two BE-4 engines. Aerojet Rocketdyne's AR1 engine is being retained by ULA as a contingency option, with a final decision to be made in 2016. The first stage can optionally have from zero to six solid rocket boosters (SRBs), and in the maximal configuration could launch a heavier payload than the highest-rated Atlas V, though still less than the Delta IV Heavy. A later feature is planned to make the first stage partly reusable. ULA plans to develop the technology to allow the engines to <b>detach</b> from the <b>vehicle</b> after cutoff, descend through the atmosphere with a heat shield and parachute, and finally be captured by a helicopter in mid-air. In April 2015, ULA estimated that reusing the engines would reduce the cost of the first stage propulsion by 90%, with propulsion being 65% of the total first stage build cost.|$|R
500|$|During {{the sixth}} {{hour of the}} race Gary Hirsch lost power in his Greaves Gibson-Nissan through the Esses {{and came to a}} halt; the car would later be {{abandoned}} after Hirsch was unable to repair a broken battery terminal. The No. 71 Ferrari was forced to the garage to fix starter motor problems, bowing out of its battle with Corvette and Aston Martin in LMGTE Pro. As dusk settled on the circuit, the No. 18 Porsche of Dumas braked too late for Mulsanne Corner and hit a tyre barrier. The car was able to return to the pit lane, only requiring new front bodywork, but the car fell to fifth position. Not long after Paul-Loup Chatin crashed his Signatech Alpine at Mulsanne Corner, bringing the safety cars out for the third time of the race. During this slow period Rob Bell pulled the No. 97 Aston Martin off course and onto the inside run-off area at the Mulsanne Straight and retired. When racing resumed, Hülkenberg was able to attack the leaders, first overtaking Webber's Porsche around the outside on the opening lap then passing Rast when he made a scheduled pit stop. Webber was later given a one-minute stop and go penalty for passing in a yellow flag zone, dropping him to fourth place. Nissan lost one of their three LMP1 entries when Tsugio Matsuda's No. 21 car stopped at Arnage with a suspension failure that caused its front-left wheel to <b>detach</b> from the <b>vehicle</b> and was unable to continue. The No. 22 Nissan also suffered a setback when it hit a loose wheel out on the Mulsanne Straight at [...] and required a lengthy repair to its front-end.|$|R
40|$|This NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) Phase I study {{examined}} the revolutionary concept of performing resource collection and utilization during Mars orbital operations in order to enable the landing of large payloads. An exploration architecture was developed, out of which several mission alternatives were developed. Concepts of operations were then developed for each mission alternative, followed by concepts for spacecraft systems, which were traded to assess their feasibility. A novel architecture using Mars Molniya Orbit Atmospheric Resource Mining is feasible to enable an Earth-independent and pioneering, permanent human presence on Mars by providing a reusable, single-stage-to-orbit transportation system. This will allow cargo and crew to be routinely delivered to and from Mars without transporting propellants from Earth. In Phase I, our study explored how electrical energy could be harnessed from the kinetic energy of the incoming spacecraft and then be used to produce the oxygen necessary for landing. This concept of operations is revolutionary in that its focus is on using in situ resources in complementary and varied forms: the upper atmosphere of Mars is used for aerocapture, which is followed by aerobraking, the kinetic energy of the spacecraft is transformed into usable electrical energy during aerobraking, and the atmospheric composition {{is the source of}} oxidizer for a landing under supersonic retropropulsion. This NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) Phase I study explores a novel mission architecture to establish routine, Earth-independent transfer of large mass payloads between Earth and the Mars surface and back to Mars orbit. The first stage of routine mission operations involves an atmospheric resource mining aerobraking campaign following aerocapture into a highly elliptical Mars orbit. During each pass through the atmosphere, the vehicle ingests the atmospheric oxidizer and stores it onboard, using solid oxide electrolysis to convert the primarily CO 2 atmosphere into usable O 2 for propellant. Power is made available through the use of magnetohydrodynamic energy generation, which converts the motion of the plasma in the shock later into usable electrical energy. Upon termination of the aerobraking sequence, the descent <b>vehicle</b> <b>detaches</b> from the orbit stack, deorbits, and executes the entry, descent, and landing sequence. Hypersonic deceleration is achieved via a deployable heat shield to lower the vehicle ballistic coefficient, and supersonic and subsonic deceleration are achieved via retropropulsion. Mars surface operations involve resource mining of the Martian regolith to produce CH 4 and O 2 propellant to be used for the subsequent MDAV ascent back to high Mars orbit (HMO) providing an apoapsis raise maneuver to initialize the aerobraking sequence, in addition to providing fuel from the Mars surface for EDL propulsive descent. The Resource Collector Vehicle (RCV), which is used for the orbital mining operations, is raised back to HMO via onboard deployable augmented solar electric propulsion. Concepts of operations were developed for each mission alternative, to evaluate between them and assess feasibility...|$|R
