Charles I (r. 1625–1649) issued plenty of edicts {{in an attempt to}} restrain the growing public demand. On 27 December 1633, he touched 100 people at Holyrood Palace.|$|E
5|$|Despite a large {{expansion}} of the prison system, the problem of overcrowding remained throughout the 20th century, as did Western Australia's high incarceration rate relative {{to the rest of}} Australia. The nature of prisoners changed, with three times the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds in 1984 compared to 1898, and a growing over-representation of Aboriginal prisoners to nearly half the incarcerated population. Sentences also increased in length, such that in 1984 more than 80% of inmates were serving more than a year. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> committed for violent crimes, but still a minority of the population. Both staff and prisoners, however, perceived a notable increase in violence during these years, coinciding with the rise of illegal drugs in prison, and of sentences for drug-related offences.|$|E

5|$|After the English Reformation of the 16th century, an <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{were unhappy}} with the control that the {{government}} and monarch had over the Church of England. This {{led to the formation}} of independent churches and schools by what are known as Dissenters. The worship of any faith other than Anglicanism was illegal, and those discovered taking part were arrested and even sentenced to death. Oliver Cromwell imposed a period of religious tolerance, but his death precipitated further persecution of Dissenters, principally through the Act of Uniformity 1549, which required the use of the Book of Common Prayer as the only legal form of worship in England. The South West of England in general, and Taunton specifically, had a significant Dissenter population. There was a Baptist community in the town by 1646, and despite continued persecution they erected their first Meeting House in Taunton, on Mary Street in 1670.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{the harbor}} and the beaches, there is another {{distinguishing}} feature of El Jebha: The Mosque. During the last decade El Jebha experienced an increasing population with a similar increase in size. This resulted in an overcrowded mosque, which could not hold this <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> For this reason a big new mosque {{was built in the}} tradition of Moroccan coastal places. This means that the color white prevails in both the exterior as the interior designs of the building structure.|$|E

25|$|It is the {{disagreement}} amongst {{the advocates of}} different approaches to problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources. That is why the Encyclopedia uses an approach that is as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility. The intent is first to contribute to clarify the nature, extent, and interrelationships of problems and solutions. Even the distinction between problems and solutions is not always clear. For instance, housing an <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> is a solution that may aggravate the problem of urban overcrowding, {{and the death of}} individuals is a problem that contributes to the solution of reducing ecological impact of overpopulation.|$|E

25|$|While amate {{is made in}} a {{few small}} villages in {{northern}} Puebla, northern Veracruz and southern Hidalgo state, only San Pablito in Puebla manufactures the paper commercially. San Pablito is a village in the municipality of Pahuatlán located in the Sierra Norte de Puebla. Tulancingo, Hidalgo is the closest urban center. The area is very mountainous and the village itself {{is on the side}} of a mountain called the Cerro del Brujo. The making of the paper is the primary economic activity of the community and has alleviated poverty in the village. Before the villagers only had very small houses made of wood, but now they have much larger houses made of block. The paper makers here guard the process greatly and will sever contact with anyone seeking to replicate their work. In addition to providing income to the paper makers themselves the craft has been employing an <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> to harvest bark, over an area which now extends over 1,500km2 in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region. The village manufactures large quantities of paper, still using mostly pre-Hispanic technology and various tree species for raw material. About half of this paper production is still sold to Nahua painters in Guerrero.|$|E
