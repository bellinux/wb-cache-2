5|$|Before his {{appointment}} {{to lead the}} Discovery Expedition, Scott had followed the career of a naval officer in the Royal Navy. In 1899, {{he had a chance}} encounter with Sir Clements Markham, the president of the Royal Geographical Society, and thus learned of a planned Antarctic expedition, which he soon volunteered to lead. Having taken this step, his name became <b>inseparably</b> associated with the Antarctic, the field of work to which he remained committed during the final 12 years of his life.|$|E
5|$|A History of British Birds, Bewick's great {{achievement}} and with which {{his name is}} <b>inseparably</b> associated, was published in two volumes: History and Description of Land Birds in 1797 and History and Description of Water Birds in 1804, with a supplement in 1821. The Birds is specifically British, but is the forerunner of all modern field guides. Bewick was helped by his intimate knowledge of the habits of animals acquired during his frequent excursions into the country. He also recounts information passed to him by acquaintances and local gentry, and that obtained in natural history works of his time, including those by Thomas Pennant and Gilbert White, {{as well as the}} translation of Buffon's Histoire naturelle.|$|E

25|$|The arms of Ulster are {{the arms}} of the de Burgh, Earls of Ulster, {{combined}} with the red hand seal of the O'Neills. These two dynasties and symbols are <b>inseparably</b> linked to Ulster. The combination of them is blazoned Or, on a Cross Gules, an inescutcheon Argent, charged with a dexter hand erect aupaumee and couped at the wrist Gules.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} of all Dalton's investigations are concerned with the atomic theory in chemistry. While his name is <b>inseparably</b> associated with this theory, the origin of Dalton's atomic theory is not fully understood. The theory may have been suggested to him either by researches on ethylene (olefiant gas) and methane (carburetted hydrogen) or by analysis of nitrous oxide (protoxide of azote) and nitrogen dioxide (deutoxide of azote), both views resting on the authority of Thomas Thomson.|$|E
25|$|Church {{and state}} were <b>inseparably</b> linked in Spanish policy, {{with the state}} {{assuming}} responsibility for religious establishments. One of Spain's objectives in colonizing the Philippines was {{the conversion of the}} local population to Roman Catholicism. The work of conversion was facilitated by the disunity and insignificance of other organized religions, except for Islam, which was still predominant in the southwest. The pageantry of the church had a wide appeal, reinforced by the incorporation of indigenous social customs into religious observances. The eventual outcome was a new Roman Catholic majority, from which the Muslims of western Mindanao and the upland tribal and animistic peoples of Luzon remained detached and alienated from (Ethnic groups such as the Ifugaos of the Cordillera region and the Mangyans of Mindoro).|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{for some}} Christians, {{it may be}} {{inferred}} that the Bible cannot both refer to itself as being divinely inspired and also be errant or fallible. For if the Bible were divinely inspired, then the source of inspiration being divine, would {{not be subject to}} fallibility or error in that which is produced. For them, the doctrines of the divine inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy, are <b>inseparably</b> tied together. The idea of Biblical integrity is a further concept of infallibility, by suggesting that current Biblical text is complete and without error, and that the integrity of Biblical text has never been corrupted or degraded. Historians note, or claim, that the doctrine of the Bible's infallibility was adopted hundreds of years after those books were written.|$|E
25|$|The Neo-Platonic {{interpretation}} of Plato prevailed until the beginning {{the nineteenth century}} when in 1804 Friedrich Schleiermacher published an introduction to his 1804 translation of Plato's dialogues and initiated a radical turn whose consequences are still felt today. Schleiermacher {{was convinced that the}} entire content of Plato's philosophy was contained in his dialogues. There never was, he insisted, any oral teaching that went beyond them. According to his conception, the genre of the dialogue is no literary replacement for Plato's philosophy, rather the literary form of the dialogue and the content of Plato's philosophy are <b>inseparably</b> bound together: Plato's way of philosophizing can by its nature only be represented as a literary dialogue. Therefore, unwritten doctrines with any philosophically relevant, special content that are not bound together into a literary dialogue must be excluded.|$|E
25|$|Demanding concert tour {{schedules}} caused Rachmaninoff's output as {{a composer}} to slow significantly, so that between {{his arrival in}} the US in 1918 and his death in 1943, he completed just six compositions. Clearly his composition time was limited {{because he had to}} keep performing to support his family, but also his nostalgia for Russia seemed to dampen his compositional creativity. So demanding was his schedule that he termed his concert season 'harvest time’, becoming increasingly disillusioned, and entrenched in the idea of his being a failure: ‘I was born a failure and therefore I bear all the burdens that are <b>inseparably</b> part of this status,’ he wrote to Yevgeny Somov in 1923. Despite Rachmaninoff’s concerns, he was lauded by the American public, who loved seeing the famous composer of their favourite Prelude in C-sharp minor.|$|E
25|$|From {{this time}} he was <b>inseparably</b> {{associated}} with Catherine in all important diplomatic affairs, though officially he was the subordinate of the vice-chancellor, Count Ivan Osterman. He wrote all the most important despatches to the Russian ministers abroad, concluded and subscribed all treaties, and performed all the functions of a secretary of state. He identified himself entirely with Catherine's political ideas, even with that of re-establishing the Greek empire under her grandson Constantine. The empress, as usual, richly rewarded her comes with pensions and principalities. In 1786 he was promoted to the Governing Senate, and it was through him that the empress communicated her will to that august state-decoration. In 1787 he accompanied Catherine on her triumphal progress through South Russia in the capacity of minister of foreign affairs. At Kanev he conducted the negotiations with the Polish king, Stanislaus II, and at Novaya Kaidaniya he was in the empress's carriage when she received Joseph II.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} her dissertation, the research of Anna Christensen came {{to concentrate on the}} law of Welfare Society, i.e. those parts of the legal system that are developed to protect everyday life of the common men and women; Labour Law, Housing Law and Social Security Law were all to become her domain and main fields of research. In Disqualification from Unemployment Benefits (Avstängning från arbetslöshetsförsäkring), from 1980, Christensen studied the Swedish rules on disqualification from unemployment benefits on the ground of refusal of work and other self-imposed unemployment. The main {{purpose of the study was}} to disclose the control and steering of the citizens that is built into the Swedish social security system. According to Christensen, there was a strong interest on the part of the state to conceal the role that the Job Service played in the system. Furthermore, Christensen meant that the state had an interest in concealing how the behavior-steering and repressive functions of the social security system were <b>inseparably</b> associated with the supportive functions of the system – a fact that contradicted the ideology surrounding the Welfare State. The study represented an important shift in Christensen’s research towards a more theoretical, social-science-oriented and critical approach.|$|E
25|$|Intimately and <b>inseparably</b> {{intertwined}} histories for millennia, Turkic Qajar state, which ruled today's Iran irrevocably {{lost the}} territory that is nowadays Azerbaijan {{in the course}} of the 19th century. With the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813 following the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) Turkic Qajar state had to cede eastern Georgia, its possessions in the North Caucasus and many of those in what is today the Azerbaijan Republic, which included Baku Khanate, Shirvan Khanate, Karabakh Khanate, Ganja Khanate, Shaki Khanate, Quba Khanate, and parts of the Talysh Khanate. Derbent (Darband) Khanate of Dagestan was also lost to Russia. These Khanates comprise most of what is today the Republic of Azerbaijan and Dagestan in Southern Russia. By the Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828 following the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828), the result was even more disastrous, and resulted in Turkic Qajar state being forced to cede the Nakhichevan Khanate and the Mughan regions to Russia, as well as Erivan Khanate, and the remainder of the Talysh Khanate. All these territories together, lost in 1813 and 1828 combined, constitute all of the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan, the Republic of Armenia, and southern Dagestan. The area to the North of the river Aras, among which the territory of the contemporary republic of Azerbaijan was historically a Turkic territory until they were occupied by Russia {{in the course of}} the 19th century.|$|E

500|$|The Admonitions {{argues that}} kingship is <b>inseparably</b> {{connected}} with the Catholic faith. Its author emphasized that a monarch is required to make donations to the Church and regularly consult his prelates, but is entitled to punish clergymen who do wrong. One of its basic ideas was that a sovereign has {{to cooperate with the}} [...] "pillars of his rule", meaning the prelates, aristocrats, ispáns and warriors.|$|E
500|$|In July 2008, American Prospect {{associate}} editor Ezra Klein derided the Conservapedia article on atheism in his weekly column: [...] "As Daniel DeGroot notes, you've got to wonder which 'unreasonable' explanations they rejected when formulating that entry". To this day on Conservapedia, dozens of articles assert that atheism is <b>inseparably</b> tied to {{such issues as}} anger, arrogance, narcissism, cowardice, emotional immaturity, hedonism, mass murder, psychological disorders, lack of social skills, lack of intellectual or emotional intelligence, disregard for health and well-being, slavery or forced labor, and general lack of morality.|$|E
500|$|State regalia were {{increasingly}} passed from one king to the next. The first {{example of this}} was HenryVIII's Crown. Its date of manufacture is unknown but it was probably created {{at the beginning of}} the Tudor dynasty. The gold crown was covered in pearls, rubies, sapphires and diamonds, and its rim was decorated with alternating crosses pattée and fleurs-de-lis. The centre petals of the fleurs-de-lis had images of Christ, the Virgin Mary and child, StGeorge, and possibly Edmund the Martyr and Edward the Confessor. Although some English monarchs laid claim to the French throne, the fleurs-de-lis on their crowns had evolved from the trefoil introduced by King Canute and were purely decorative. The concept of hereditary state regalia was enshrined in law after the Union of the Crowns when JamesVI andI decreed in 1605: [...] "Roiall and Princely ornaments and Jewells [...] to be indyvidually and <b>inseparably</b> for ever hereafter annexed to the Kingdome of this Realme".|$|E
500|$|Egyptian funerary art was <b>inseparably</b> {{connected}} to the religious belief that life continued after death – even more, it expressed a belief that [...] "death is a mere phase of life". Aesthetic objects and images connected with this belief were partially intended to preserve material goods, wealth and status for the journey between this life and the next, and to [...] "commemorate {{the life of the}} tomb owner... depict performance of the burial rites, and in general present an environment that would be conducive to the tomb owner's rebirth." [...] In this context, Egyptian mummies encased in one or more layers of decorated coffin, are famous; canopic jars preserved the internal organs. A special category of Ancient Egyptian funerary texts clarify the purposes of the burial customs. [...] The early mastaba type of tomb had a sealed underground burial chamber but an offering-chamber on the ground level for visits by the living, a pattern repeated in later types of tomb. A Ka statue effigy of the deceased might be walled up in a serdab {{connected to}} the offering chamber by vents that allowed the smell of incense to reach the effigy. [...] The walls of important tomb-chambers and offering chambers were heavily decorated with reliefs in stone or sometimes wood, or paintings, depicting religious scenes, portraits of the deceased, and at some periods vivid images of everyday life, depicting the afterlife. The chamber decoration usually centred on a [...] "false door", through which only the soul of the deceased could pass, to receive the offerings left by the living.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Yolanda M. Manora {{insisted that}} three women in Caged Bird—the [...] "hybridized mother" [...] of Angelou's {{grandmother}}, her mother, {{and her friend}} Mrs. Flowers—taught her {{how to be a}} mother to her son Guy. Although Angelou's grandmother died early in the series, in her third autobiography Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, Angelou quoted her many times throughout the series. Angelou's desire for security for Guy drove her to marry Tosh Angelos in Singin' and Swingin, and drove many of her decisions, job choices, and romantic relationships. Scholar Siphokazi Koyana stated that due to Angelou's race and economic background, her [...] "experience of motherhood is <b>inseparably</b> intertwined with work". [...] According to Koyana, [...] "...Black motherhood always encompassed work". Angelou's long list of occupations attested to the challenges, especially in her second autobiography Gather Together in My Name, she faced as a working teenager mother, which often led Angelou to questionable decisions. [...] Koyana stated that it was not until Angelou was {{able to take advantage of}} opportunities, such as her role in Porgy and Bess, when she was able to fully support her and Guy, and the quality of her life and her contribution to society improved. [...] It was impossible, however, for Angelou to become successful without her extended family to provide childcare for her; i.e., when she left Guy in the care of his grandmother in spite of the conflict and guilt she experienced as a result (something Koyana insisted was imposed on her by the larger society), a pattern established in Caged Bird by her own mother when she left Angelou and her brother in the care of Angelou's grandmother.|$|E

2500|$|Due to his helping {{gain the}} fall of Danby in December 1678, Sidney {{received}} 500 guineas from the French, getting another 500 guineas the next year. Sidney wished for an alliance of English and Dutch republicans against the Stuart–Orange alliance and told Barillon [...] "that it is an old error {{to believe that it}} is against the interest of France to suffer England to become a republic".

2500|$|In {{addition}} to simply arguing for their rights as Englishmen, the congress also asserted {{that they had}} certain natural rights solely because they were human beings.

2500|$|Poverty {{and poor}} health are <b>inseparably</b> linked. [...] Poverty has many {{dimensions}} – material deprivation (of food, shelter, sanitation, and safe drinking water), social exclusion, lack of education, unemployment, and low income – that {{all work together}} to reduce opportunities, limit choices, undermine hope, and, as a result, threaten health. Poverty {{has been linked to}} higher prevalence of many health conditions, including increased risk of chronic disease, injury, deprived infant development, stress, anxiety, depression, and premature death. According to Loppie and Wien, these health afflictions of poverty most burden outlying groups such as women, children, ethnic minorities, and the disabled. Social determinants of health – like child development, education, living and working conditions, and healthcare- are of special importance to the impoverished.|$|E
2500|$|Gauss's law for {{magnetism}} {{states that}} there are no [...] "magnetic charges" [...] (also called magnetic monopoles), analogous to electric charges. Instead, the magnetic field due to materials is generated by a configuration called a dipole. Magnetic dipoles are best represented as loops of current but resemble positive and negative 'magnetic charges', <b>inseparably</b> bound together, having no net 'magnetic charge'. In terms of field lines, this equation states that magnetic field lines neither begin nor end but make loops or extend to infinity and back. In other words, any magnetic field line that enters a given volume must somewhere exit that volume. Equivalent technical statements are that the sum total magnetic flux through any Gaussian surface is zero, or that the magnetic field is a solenoidal vector field.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{position}} as archdeacon, Scott {{was a member of}} the Legislative Council (ranking next behind the Lieutenant Governor) and had almost complete control of all church matters. The Colonial Office appointed him King's Visitor to schools and so he became responsible for public education throughout the colony. His educational policy was guided by the principle that the church and education were <b>inseparably</b> connected and the funds to sustain them were administered by the same trustees. Since this view was shared by the Colonial Office, the Governor Bathurst, in March 1826, created the Corporation of the Trustees of Church and School Lands, granting one-seventh of the lands of New South Wales to the corporation for the purposes of the Church of England and education in the colony. Scott became the ex officio Vice-President (the President being the Governor.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{mainstream}} of Roman philosophy, {{such as the}} Stoics, advocated contemplation and acceptance of the inevitability of death of all mortals. [...] "It is necessary for some to stay and for others to go, all the while rejoicing {{with those who are}} with us, yet not grieving for those departing." [...] To grieve bitterly is to fail to perceive and accept the nature of things. Famously, Epictetus encouraged contemplation of one's loved ones as a [...] "jar" [...] or [...] "crystal cup" [...] which might break and be remembered without troubling the spirit, since [...] "you love a mortal, something not your own.

2500|$|Greeks {{argue that}} the name Macedonia is {{historically}} <b>inseparably</b> associated with Greek culture, ever since the ancient kingdom of Macedonia and the ancient Macedonians. They therefore consider that only Greeks have a historical right to use the name today, since the modern southern Slavs arrived 1,000 years after that kingdom, lacking any relation to ancient Macedonia or its Greek culture. Efforts by ethnic Macedonians to construct a narrative of ethnic continuity linking them to the ancient Macedonians in various ways and symbolic actions underlining such claims, such as the public use of the Vergina sun symbol as a flag of the Republic of Macedonia, or the renaming of Skopje Airport to [...] "Alexander the Great Airport" [...] meet strong criticism from the Greek side, much of the international media that report on the issue, and even from moderate political views in the Republic of Macedonia itself.|$|E
2500|$|The interwar period {{dominated}} by Horthy's government {{is known in}} Hungarian as the Horthy-kor ("Horthy age") or Horthy-rendszer ("Horthy system"). Its legacy, and that of Horthy himself, remain among the most controversial political topics in Hungary today, tied <b>inseparably</b> to the Treaty of Trianon and the Holocaust. [...] According to one school of thought, Horthy was a strong, conservative, but not undemocratic leader and patriot who only entered into an alliance with Hitler's Germany in order to restore lands Hungary lost after the First World War and was reluctant, or even defiant, {{in the face of}} Germany's demands to deport the Hungarian Jewry. [...] Others see Horthy's alliance with Germany as foolhardy, or think that a positive view of Horthy serves a revisionist historical agenda, pointing to Horthy's passage of various anti-Jewish laws — the earliest in Europe, in 1920 — as a sign of his anti-Semitism and the prelude for the collaboration in the Holocaust.|$|E
2500|$|Some of Shakespeare's {{work was}} {{performed}} in continental Europe even during his lifetime; Ludwig Tieck pointed out German versions of Hamlet and other plays, of uncertain provenance, but certainly quite old. [...] {{but it was not}} until after the middle of the next century that Shakespeare appeared regularly on German stages. In Germany Lessing compared Shakespeare to German folk literature. Goethe organised a Shakespeare jubilee in Frankfurt in 1771, stating that the dramatist had shown that the Aristotelian unities were [...] "as oppressive as a prison" [...] and were [...] "burdensome fetters on our imagination". Herder likewise proclaimed that reading Shakespeare's work opens [...] "leaves from the book of events, of providence, of the world, blowing in the sands of time." [...] This claim that Shakespeare's work breaks though all creative boundaries to reveal a chaotic, teeming, contradictory world became characteristic of Romantic criticism, later being expressed by Victor Hugo in the preface to his play Cromwell, in which he lauded Shakespeare as an artist of the grotesque, a genre in which the tragic, absurd, trivial and serious were <b>inseparably</b> intertwined.|$|E
