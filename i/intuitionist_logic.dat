40|$|Abstract. This paper {{develops}} a new framework for combining propositional logics, called “juxtaposition”. Several general metalogical theorems are proved concerning {{the combination of}} logics by juxtaposition. In particular, it is shown that under reasonable conditions, juxtaposition preserves strong soundness. Under reasonable conditions, the juxtaposition of two consequence relations is a conservative extension of each of them. A general strong completeness result is proved. The paper then examines the philosophically important case of the combination of classical and <b>intuitionist</b> <b>logics.</b> Particular {{attention is paid to}} the phenomenon of collapse. It is shown that there are logics with two stocks of classical or intuitionist connectives that do not collapse. Finally, the paper briefly investigates the question of which rules, when added to these logics, lead to collapse. § 1. Introduction. Methods of combining logics are of great interest. 1 Formal systems that result from the combination of multiple logical systems into a single system have applications in mathematics, linguistics, and computer science.

40|$|The {{major concern}} {{in the study of}} {{categories}} of logics is to describe condition for preservation, under the a method of combination of logics, of meta-logical properties. Our complementary approach to this field is study the "global" aspects of categories of logics in the vein of the categories,, _s studied in AFLM 3. All these categories have good properties however the category of logics does not allow a good treatment of the "identity problem" for logics (Bez) : for instance, the presentations of "classical logics" (e. g., in the signature {, ∨} and {',→'}) are not -isomorphic. In this work, we sketch a possible way to overcome this "defect" (and anothers) by a mathematical device: a representation theory of logics obtained from category theoretic aspects on (Blok-Pigozzi) algebraizable logics. In this setting we propose the study of (left and right) "Morita equivalence" of logics and variants. We introduce the concepts of logics (left/right) -(stably) -Morita-equivalent and show that the presentations of classical logics are stably Morita equivalent but classical <b>logics</b> and <b>intuitionist</b> <b>logics</b> are not stably-Morita-equivalent: they are only stably-Morita-adjointly related.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{defend the}} view that natural {{languages}} are concrete biopsychological phenomena to be studied empirically. In Section One, I begin with an historical explanation. Some analytic philosophers, I argue, misapply formal logic as an analysis of natural language, when {{it was in fact}} originally developed as an alternative to natural language, employed for scientific purposes. Abstract, quasi-mathematical philosophies of language, I argue, are partially a result of this misunderstanding. I respond to Jerrold Katz’ argument that a proper understanding of analytic truth requires this quasi-mathematical philosophy of language through a model-theoretical analysis of analytic truth in modal and <b>intuitionist</b> <b>logics.</b> In Section Two, I offer a positive argument for a biopsychological philosophy of language. While Chomsky and others have emphasized the metaphysical basis of natural languages in psychological representations, I further contribute to understanding by emphasizing the basis of natural language in psychological representations of relevant properties of a specifically constrained biological implementation base. I defend this ontological perspective through a thorough engagement with the subfield of linguistic phonology and its important relations to physiological articulation and perception, along with an analysis of crucial interface relations among phonology, morphology and syntax. In the final section, I engage with the objections to this biopsychological philosophy of language stemming from concerns related to linguistic normativity and communication. If natural language is based metaphysically in the biopsychological representations of individuals, there are apparent paradoxes in the notion of public rules for language use, and in the notion of shared content for the purpose of communication. Drawing on David Forrest Wallace’s pragmatic conception of linguistic prescription, together with analogies from anti-realist metaethical systems, I defend the intelligibility of public linguistics norms without the need for abstract ontological commitment. Drawing on Ray Jackendoff’s internalist semantic and metasemantic analysese, together with Burtrand Russell’s analogy argument on other minds, I also defend intelligibility of linguistic communication equally without need for abstract ontological commitment...|$|R
50|$|The {{interpretation}} of negation {{is different in}} <b>intuitionist</b> <b>logic</b> than in classical logic. In classical logic, the negation of a statement asserts that the statement is false; to an intuitionist, it means the statement is refutable(e.g., {{that there is a}} counterexample). There is thus an asymmetry between a positive and negative statement in intuitionism. If a statement P is provable, then it is certainly impossible to prove that there is no proof of P. But even if it can be shown that no disproof of P is possible, we cannot conclude from this absence that there is a proof of P. Thus P is a stronger statement than not-not-P.|$|E

40|$|There is {{widespread}} agreement that {{while on a}} Dummettian theory of meaning the justified logic is intuitionist, as its constants are governed by harmonious rules of inference, the situation is reversed on Huw Price's bilateralist account, where meanings are specified in terms of primitive speech acts assertion and denial. In bilateral logics, the rules for classical negation are in harmony. However, as {{it is possible to}} construct an intuitionist bilateral logic with harmonious rules, there is no formal argument against intuitionism from the bilateralist perspective. Price gives an informal argument for classical negation based on a pragmatic notion of belief, characterised in terms of the differences they make to speakers' actions. The main part of this paper puts Price's argument under close scrutiny by regimenting it and isolating principles Price is committed to. It is shown that Price should draw a distinction between A or ¬A making a difference. According to Price, if A makes a difference to us, we treat it as decidable. This material allows the intuitionist to block Price's argument. Abandoning classical logic also brings advantages, as within <b>intuitionist</b> <b>logic</b> there is a precise meaning to what it might mean to treat A as decidable: it is to assume A ∨ ¬A...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In the {{literature}} {{one can see}} the increasing trend of supporting intuitionism through phenomenology. Brouwer’s pupil, Arend Heyting, {{is said to be a}} forerunner of this trend, as he used a phenomenological terminology in order to define intuitionist negation, by elaborating the first <b>intuitionist</b> <b>logic.</b> In this paper, the author tries to explore—with reference to the unpublished material stored in the Heyting archive—how much of Heyting’s general thought is compatible with phenomenology. In the conclusion she suggests that Heyting and Husserl, insofar as they both think consciousness must be the very beginning of knowledge, share a same anti-psychologistic attitude which coexists with an attempt to overcome solipsism. Yet, the phenomenological concept of degree of evidence cannot be applied to Heyting’s scale of evidence (including small natural numbers, large natural numbers, infinitely proceeding sequences, the universal quantifier), on the one side because it is not clear if the latter is common and shared by all intuitionists, and, on the other side, because the former presupposes a revisable evidence that does not fit to Heyting’s viewpoint. Furthermore, Husserl’s and Heyting’s conceptions of the nature of mathematics and logic and of their relationship are essentially different. From an intuitionist viewpoint mathematics is the domain of evidence, while logic transcribes its regularities. From a phenomenological viewpoint, mathematics remains outside the domain of evidence. Apophantic logic coincides with mathematics (without either of them absorbing the other), but transcendental logic lies at a higher level. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{prima facie}} case for {{considering}} “informational semantics ” as an alternative explication {{of the notion of}} logical consequence alongside the model-theoretical and the proof-theoretical one is easily summarised. Where the model-theory is standardly associated with a defence of classical logic, and proof-theory with a defence of <b>intuitionist</b> <b>logic,</b> informational seman-tics seems to wedded to relevant and other substructural logics. As such, if the CL, IL, RL trio is a representative chunk of a broader range of logical options, informational semantics surely has its place. Yet, it is even easier to dismiss the suggestion that informational semantics provides an appar-ently missing third conception of logical consequence. After all, isn’t it just a variant of the usual interpretation of the Routley-Meyer relational se-mantics rather than a genuine alternative to a model-theoretic account? Or worse, isn’t it a mere metaphor? In the present paper, we want to consider a more subtle {{answer to the question of}} whether informational semantics is a real alternative for the two more traditional contenders. Let us, to begin with, recall where so-called informational semantics come from. Two aspects are relevant here; one affirmative, the other rather defensive. On the affirmative side, we have the family resemblance be-tween the use of partial information-states in relevant logic—especially its first-degree fragment—and Barwise and Perry’s situation semantics (Dunn [1976]). The defensive side, by contrast, is to be found in the use of situ-ation semantics, and in particular in the use of the notion of information-flow, as part of the defense of the Routley-Meyer relational semantics—the infamous ternary relation—against the charge that it didn’t constitute a genuine semantics. To that end, Restall [1995] used a version of Barwise’s channel-theory, and Mares [1997] a theory of information due to Israel & Perry [1990]. This resulted in both cases in an interpretation of a pre-existing semantics. More exactly, it extends the analogy between partial information-states and situations beyond the first-degree fragment by in-cluding connections between situations, and provides an intuitive picture for the less palpable model-theoretic account of the meaning of relevant implication. ...|$|E
40|$|Recursive arithmetics {{are usually}} based on three initial functions, namely the zero, {{successor}} and identity functions. In this thesis recursive arithmetics are considered which {{instead of having}} just one successor function {{have a number of}} different successor functions. These will be represented by Sv where v ranges from 1 to n. The system is made commutative by stipulating that SuSvx = SvSux for all u and v. The notion of a primitive recursive function is introduced into this arithmetic and various basic functions are defined. Another recursive arithmetic is then constructed in which the elements are ordered sets of natural numbers. It is shown that a complete isomorphism, both functional and deductive, exists between this arithmetic and the arithmetic with n successors. It is then shown by using this isomorphism that a proof can be constructed of the key equation x + (y - x) = y + (x - y) in multiple successor recursive arithmetic. A formal equation calculus is then developed for multiple successor recursive arithmetic in which the proof of the key equation given above is derived without resource to a doubly recursive uniqueness rule. The properties of the basic primitive recursive functions are also established. The problem of avoiding irregular models of this equation calculus is then examined and it is shown that this can be done by using relatively simple axioms. An inequality relationship is then defined and it is shown that with respect to this relationship the numbers of a multiple successor recursive arithmetic form a lattice. It is then shown that this lattice is modular and distributive. The problem of introducing limited universal and existential quantifiers is then considered. It is shown that this can be done in an arithmetic of ordered sets and hence, by the isomorphism established earlier, they can also be introduced into a multiple successor recursive arithmetic. Three different logical models in multiple successor recursive arithmetic are then considered. The models are of classical two-valued logic, a modified form of Heyting's <b>intuitionist</b> <b>logic,</b> and a many-valued logic. The connection between these models is examined...|$|E
40|$|The main {{conclusion}} of the thesis is that, rather than deciding disputes over the validity of logical laws between classical and intuitionist logicians, Dummett’s and Prawitz’ proof-theoretic justification of deduction entails a pluralism in which both logics have their place. I begin by isolating the essential parts of Dummett’s and Prawitz theory. This allows me to modify it at various places so as to free it from verificationist presuppositions which permeate the original theory. Dummett and Prawitz think that the decision which logic is the justified one goes in favour of <b>intuitionist</b> <b>logic.</b> I show them to be mistaken at two points. First, I show that the meaning of negation cannot be defined proof-theoretically. It follows that the prooftheoretic justification of deduction cannot decide whether negation should be governed by classical or by intuitionist rules. As a consequence, Dummett and Prawitz are left with no good argument against classical logic. I {{argue that there is}} also no acceptable amendment of the theory to remedy this. Secondly, Dummett and Prawitz only consider deductions made from sets of hypotheses, but {{there is at least one}} other reasonable way of collecting them, which is used in relevance logic. I conclude that the proof-theoretic justification of deduction commits us to accepting at least classical, intuitionist and relevance logic. Because this logical pluralism is a consequence of the proof-theoretic justification of deduction, I argue that it is a wellmotivated position and outline how to defend it against objections that it is incoherent. In a formal chapter I specify the general forms of rules of inference and general methods for determining elimination/introduction rules for logical constants from their introduction/elimination rules. On this basis I re-define Dummett’s and Prawitz’ notions of harmony and stability in a formally precise way and provide generalised procedures for removing maximal formulas from deductions. The result is a general framework for proving normalisation theorems for a large class of logics. The thesis ends with some reflections on the consequences of pluralism for the relation between logic and metaphysics. I argue that what has to be given up is the thought that the proof-theoretic justification of deduction can decide the metaphysical issues between realists and anti-realists. Ph.
