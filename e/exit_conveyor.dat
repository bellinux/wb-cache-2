40|$|Based on Indonesian National Standard (SNI) No 3926 : 2008, {{egg weight}} is {{classified}} into three classifications: small (60 g). Nowadays egg grading process in Indonesia was still done manually. The {{objective of this}} research was for designing, constructing, and performance testing of egg sorting machine. The machine testing includes performance accuracy, machine capacity, and egg crack of the sorting result. The egg sorting machine consisted of five main parts: conveyor system, steering conveyor system, sorting conveyor system, and <b>exit</b> <b>conveyor</b> system. Test result showed that the machine could sort the egg with accuracy of 83 % without any cracking in eggshell. The machine capacity was most affected by the speed of sorting conveyor system. The variables which influence the speed of sorting conveyor system were initial speed rotation (Na), work speed rotation (Nb), and length of the track on initial speed rotation path (L). The maximum machine capacity was 61 eggs per minute and obtained by configuration of Na, Nb, and L of 15. 5 rpm, 24. 5 rpm, and 6 cm respectively...|$|E
40|$|On May 11, 2011, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{received}} {{a request from}} the management of an automobile and scrap metal shredding facility regarding cases of Legionnaires' disease that had been identified among their workers. The request listed concerns about dusts, mists, and vapors generated {{during the process of}} shredding automobiles and scrap metal. The health concerns were Legionnaires' disease and respiratory disease. During telephone discussions with the New York State Department of Health (NYSDH), NIOSH learned that four employees from the shredding facility had been diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease: one in 2009, two in 2010, and one in May 2011. All performed shoveling and/or picking activities; the latter involves manually removing copper and other material passing on a moving conveyor. In December 2010, NYSDH identified Legionella bacteria on a swab sample taken from a conveyor belt that exited the shredder and from water dripping from that same belt. An additional water sample obtained in May 2011 from the same conveyor belt also contained Legionella. Prior to our initial site visit, NIOSH investigators contacted management and recommended that any employee with respiratory, flu-like, or gastrointestinal symptoms (e. g., fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) be removed from his or her job and seek evaluation for Legionnaires' disease from a healthcare provider. We also recommended that employees who work near any aerosols or mists wear fit-tested N- 95 respirators. On June 1 - 2, 2011, NIOSH investigators visited the facility. We spoke briefly with all available facility employees about Legionnaires' disease and any symptoms they may have or have had; none reported current symptoms consistent with Legionnaires' disease. We observed large quantities of standing water throughout the facility grounds. We also observed workers standing and shoveling in or around the water; vehicles driving through puddles of water; and front-end loaders picking up and setting down materials in and around standing water. We observed no employees wearing respirators. We collected air, water, and swab samples at multiple locations around the facility to be tested for Legionella bacteria. We also collected area air samples to be analyzed for metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and dust. Legionella was identified in water dripping from the exterior of the shredder onto the <b>exit</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt that contained the shredded material and in multiple puddles of water. Metals detected in the air samples were below applicable NIOSH recommended exposure limits (RELs) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limits (PELs), where standards existed. Toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene isomers, and some alkyl benzenes were the major VOCs identified. The dust samples were below the OSHA particulates not otherwise regulated standard of 5 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m 3) for respirable particles. At the end of the walk-through visit, we again recommended implementing a formal respiratory protection program that would require employees working around or near aerosols or mists to wear fit-tested N- 95 respirators. We also discussed the possibility of Legionella in the standing water which could be aerosolized during shoveling activities and while driving or walking through the puddled water. We reiterated that symptomatic employees should be removed from their jobs until they are evaluated for Legionnaires' disease by a healthcare provider. We recommended that the groundwater drainage system be improved to eliminate the pools of water and that shoveling activities be avoided as much as possible during shredding operations because of the potential for generating aerosols. We recommended the shredder, conveyor systems, and any mobile equipment be cleaned and sanitized. Following our initial site visit, a fifth employee was diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease in June 2011. He had recently been hired at the facility, worked in the picking shed, and had not worn a respirator. On September 23, 2011, we revisited the facility to conduct a follow-up assessment. Facility grounds had been cleared of a build-up of dirt, improving drainage and revealing a previously blocked drain. A new shredder had been installed which required only half the previous water flow. The plant manager reported that the picking room had been cleaned and sanitized but not the rest of the facility. Some puddles of water still existed, and Legionella was detected in water samples taken from multiple puddles. Legionella was not detected in swab samples taken from the conveyor system. We observed workers wearing N- 95 respirators; none had been fit-tested, and some were wearing their respirators incorrectly. In each of these cases, we showed the worker how to wear the respirator. We also hung posters in the break room and mechanical room that showed how to put on and take off an N- 95 respirator. We recommended that workers wearing respirators be fit-tested. We also recommended that the ground drainage be improved to remove the remaining standing water, and {{that the rest of the}} facility be cleaned and sanitized.

50|$|In this example, {{there are}} two substances: solids and water.

50|$|A {{conveyor}} furnace uses a flexible metal belt to convey soil through the primary heating chamber. A one-inch-deep layer of soil is spread {{evenly over the}} belt. As the belt moves through the system, soil agitators lift the belt and turn the soil to enhance heat transfer and volatilization of organics. The {{conveyor furnace}} can heat soils to temperatures from 300 to 800 degrees F. At the higher temperature range, the conveyor furnace is more effective in treating some heavier petroleum hydrocarbons than are oil- or steam-heated thermal screws, asphalt plant aggregate dryers, and carbon steel rotary dryers. After the treated soil <b>exits</b> the <b>conveyor</b> furnace, it is sprayed with water for cooling and dust control. As of February 1993, only one conveyor furnace system was currently in use for the remediation of petroleum contaminated soil. This system is mobile and can treat 5 to 10 tons of soil per hour.|$|R

40|$|Cleaned, whole smooth {{green peas}} (Pisum sativum L.) were reconstituted by soaking in tap water of 40 ¿°C (15, 20 or 25 ¿min) and {{subsequently}} either toasted (100 ¿°C during 1. 5 ¿min) and infrared (IR) radiated or just IR radiated. For IR radiation, a small-scale, propane-fired IR radiation plant was used with average residence times of 58 and 92 ¿s respectively. After <b>exiting</b> the <b>conveyor</b> belt, peas were held for a pre-determined period (holding: 0, 15 or 30 ¿min respectively) in a well-insulated container. Finally, all radiated peas were flaked (roll distance 0. 75 ¿mm) in a flaking mill located posterior to the IR plant and analysed for chemical and physical properties. Initial pea starch gelatinization degree (SGD) was 10. 1 % {{at a total}} starch content of 410. 1 ¿g/kg. Infrared processing during 92 ¿s significantly improved the SGD (from 10. 1 % to 32. 8 %) of pea flakes compared to treatment during 58 ¿s (SGD of 18. 6 %). The SGD was further improved with steam treatment of peas, prior to IR. For all determined parameters, no effect of holding time could be observed. Starch gelatinization degree can be improved by soaking, toasting and IR processing. The substantial improvement of SGD, however can be only obtained by a longer IR residence {{time as well as}} through toasting, prior to the IR processing. The improvements in SGD, however are paralleled by a lower durability of flakes (range 34. 9 % to 87. 4 %) ...|$|R
