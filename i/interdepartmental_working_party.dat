50|$|By {{the time}} {{construction}} started on Tracked Hovercraft's test track, British Rail was well advanced on {{their plans for}} the steel-wheeled Advanced Passenger Train (APT). The government found itself {{in the position of}} funding two different high-speed train systems whose proponents were quick to point out problems in the competing system. To gain some clarity, they formed an <b>interdepartmental</b> <b>working</b> <b>party</b> that studied several potential inter-city transit solutions on the London-Manchester and London-Glasgow routes. The options included buses, Advanced Passenger Train, Tracked Hovercraft, and VTOL and STOL aircraft. Their December 1971 report strongly favoured APT.|$|E

50|$|The Kissinger NSC system {{sought to}} combine {{features}} of the Johnson and Eisenhower systems. The Senior Interdepartment Group (SIG) of the Johnson White House was replaced by an NSC Review Group (somewhat similar to the Eisenhower-era NSC Planning Group) together with an NSC Under Secretary's Committee. The Kissinger NSC relied upon <b>interdepartmental</b> <b>working</b> groups (IGs) to prepare for NSC directives. Critics observed that 10 IG meetings prepared the way for each SIG-level meeting, and 5 SIG meetings were needed to prepare for each NSC meeting.|$|R
40|$|Two <b>working</b> <b>parties,</b> the Working Party on Tuna Tagging in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and the Working Party on Tuna Tagging in the Atlantic and Adjacent Seas, {{were formed}} by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAD) of the United Nations in 1966 (Anonymous, 1966 c). The conveners of these <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> were Dr. James Joseph of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) and Mr. FrankJ. Mather, III, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). In 1969 it was {{recommended}} that the <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> direct their attention toward billfishes, as well as tunas (Anonymous, 1969 h: 5). One report (Joseph and <b>working</b> <b>party,</b> 1969) was published by the Pacific and Indian Oceans group and two (Mather and <b>working</b> <b>party,</b> 1969 and 1972) were published by the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas group. Each of the three <b>working</b> <b>party</b> reports included a bibliography of tuna and billfish tagging. The compiler of this bibliography, beginning in 1970, prepared numerous memoranda {{to the members of}} the <b>working</b> <b>party,</b> most of which included lists of papers on tuna and billfish tagging which had come to his attention, either directly or through members of the <b>working</b> <b>party.</b> The bibliographies in the three <b>working</b> <b>party</b> reports and the lists of references in the memoranda form the basis for the present bibliography...|$|R

30|$|Harmonization was {{implemented}} in 2005 by joining Education Department (ED) and Social Welfare Department (SWD) {{to end the}} separation of monitoring bodies on early childhood education provision (Hong Kong Government, 2005). Discussion for unification started in the 1980 s, and harmonization {{was implemented}} in the mid- 2000 s by restructuring the relevant sections within ED and SWD. This marriage of ED (renamed as Education & Manpower Bureau after 1997) and SWD come late but the two partners in this “new marriage” need time to adapt {{to each other and}} learn about what it meant by “educare”. The <b>interdepartmental</b> <b>working</b> group closely examined the harmonization of kindergartens and childcare centres.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 a <b>working</b> <b>party</b> was {{established}} to investigate an alternative schooling model that would better meet the aspirations of Māori communities in New Zealand.

Two days later, William J. Haynes, II, the General Counsel of the United States Department of Defense designated Walker as the head of an <b>interdepartmental</b> <b>working</b> group tasked with implementing the Secretary's request. Walker extablished a committee of the senior lawyers in the Pentagon and a career-level working group of those with expertise in the substantive issues and additional techniques to be given legal and policy review.|$|R

50|$|Work of {{the canal}} was {{undertaken}} by weekend <b>working</b> <b>parties,</b> including members of the S&WCS, the Dudley Tunnel Society and the Coventry Canal Society. A progress report issued by the IWA in April 1965 ultimately {{led to the formation}} of a publication called Navvies Notebook, which informed people about what was happening. It allowed volunteers to be drawn from a wider area, and in 1967, a record 45 people participated in a weekend <b>working</b> <b>party</b> on the canal. The canal was opened to through navigation again in May 1967. Following that success British Waterways went on to accept similar restoration <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> across the canal system.|$|R

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1982, the ICLCUA CAFS Special Interest Group defined three subject areas for <b>working</b> <b>party</b> activity. These were: 1) {{interfaces}} with compilers and databases, 2) end-user language facilities and display methods, and 3) text-handling and office automation. The CAFS SIG convened one <b>working</b> <b>party</b> to address the first subject with the following terms of reference: 1) review facilities and map requirements onto them, 2) "Database or CAFS" or "Database on CAFS", 3) training needs for users to bridge to new techniques, and 4) repair specifications to cover gaps in software. The <b>working</b> <b>party</b> interpreted the topic broadly as the data processing professional's, rather than the end-user's, view of and relationship with CAFS. This report {{is the result of}} the <b>working</b> <b>party's</b> activities. The report content for good reasons exceeds the terms of reference in their strictest sense. For example, we examine QUERYMASTER, which is deemed to be an end-user tool by ICL, from both the DP and end-user perspectives. First, this is the only interface to CAFS in the current SV 201. Secondly, it is necessary for the DP department to understand the end-user's interface to CAFS. Thirdly, the other subjects have not yet been addressed by other active <b>working</b> <b>parties...</b>|$|R

Reginald Bowden, chairman of the <b>working</b> <b>party,</b> became Founder Master, serving from 1975 to 1978. On 14 April 1978 letters patent were presented to the Guild of Marketors and it became a livery company.

The <b>working</b> <b>party</b> then developed consensus on a standard set of properties for instruments to measure these attributes.
