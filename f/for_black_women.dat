5|$|In 1896, the National Association of Colored Women {{was formed}} to promote the needs of black women. Bethune served as the Florida chapter {{president}} of the NACW from 1917 to 1925. She worked to register black voters, which was resisted by white society and had been made almost impossible {{by a variety of}} obstacles in Florida law and practices controlled by white administrators. She was threatened by members of the resurgent Ku Klux Klan in those years. Bethune also served {{as the president of the}} Southeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs from 1920 to 1925, which worked to improve opportunities <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Southeastern Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs (eventually renamed as the Southeastern Association of Colored Women’s Clubs) elected Bethune as {{president}} after its first conference in 1920 at the Tuskegee Institute. They intended {{to reach out}} to Southern Women (specifically white women) for support and unity in gaining rights <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>women.</b> The women met in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss interracial problems. In many respects, all of the women agreed about what needed to be changed, until they came to the topic of suffrage. The white women at the conference tried to strike down a resolution on black suffrage. The SACWC responded by issuing a pamphlet entitled Southern Negro Women and Race Co-Operation; it delineated their demands regarding conditions in domestic service, child welfare, conditions of travel, education, lynching, the public press, and voting rights. The group went on to help register black women to vote after they were granted suffrage a few months later after passage of the constitutional amendment. Within the state, however, and in other southern states, black men and women were largely disenfranchised by discriminatory application of literacy and comprehension tests, as well as requirements to pay poll taxes, lengthy residency requirements, and the need to keep and display records.|$|E

25|$|Materialist {{feminism}} {{has been}} criticized for assuming universal oppression of women. By focusing on capitalist relations combined with patriarchy, materialist feminism fails to include women of different classes, sexualities and ethnicities.

She instead noted the ways that values of the family are different <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>women</b> and men, just as the division of labor is also radicalized.|$|E

25|$|Clenora Hudson-Weems's Africana womanism {{arose from}} a {{nationalist}} Africana studies concept. In Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves, Hudson-Weems explores {{the limitations of}} feminist theory and explains the ideas and activism of different African women who have contributed to womanist theory. At its core, Africana womanism rejects feminism because it is {{set up in a}} way as to promote the issues of white women over the issues of Black women. Hudson-Weems argues that feminism will never be okay <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>women</b> due to the implications of slavery and prejudice. She further asserts that the relationship between a Black man and a Black woman is significantly different from the relationship between a White man and a White woman, because the white woman battles the white man for subjugating her, but the black women battles all oppressive forces that subjugate her, her children, and the black man. She further asserts that racism forced African-American men and African-American women to assume unconventional gender roles. In this context, the desire of mainstream feminism to dismantle traditional gender roles becomes inapplicable to the black experience. Unlike womanism, Africana womanism is an ideology designed specifically with women of African descent in mind. It is grounded in African culture and focuses on the unique struggles, needs, and desires of African women. Based on this reasoning, Africana Womanism posits race- and class-based oppression as far more significant than gender-based oppression.|$|E

500|$|The {{results for}} black {{men were in}} general {{the same as those}} for white men, except that while the [...] "Identification with Father" [...] {{variable}} had some significance for white men, it had none for black men, and whereas for white men pre-adult sexual feelings were important in the development of adult homosexuality, childhood and adolescent sexual activities were important for black men. Bell et al. suggested that this finding could show that black males became homosexual due to their early homosexual activities, which was consistent with a learning theory interpretation, but that alternatively it might reflect [...] "the freer sexual attitude of the black community", which could have allowed their black respondents to act on their sexual inclinations at an earlier age than their white respondents.

Racism prevented the organization from association with its white counterpart the Indiana State Federation of Women's Organizations. White Hoosier suffragist May Wright Sewall spoke at the founding convention in a show of solidarity with Black Hoosier women. The Indiana Association of Colored Women's Clubs sponsored 56 clubs in 46 cities in the state, with 2000 members by 1933, and a budget of over $20,000. Most members were public school teachers or hairdressers, as well as women active and local business in the black community, and in government positions. They affiliated with the National Federation of Afro-American Women, headed by Mrs. Booker T. Washington, and became part of her husband's powerful network of black activists.

500|$|Murray's speech, [...] "Jim Crow and Jane Crow", {{was given}} during Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency. It {{primarily}} addresses {{an audience of}} African-American women.

She asserted that African-American women have worked just as hard as, if not harder than, African-American men to achieve equal rights among black people and white people. According to Murray, [...] "Not only have they stood...with Negro men in every phase of the battle, but they have also continued to stand when their men were destroyed by it." [...] The black women decided to [...] "...continue......" [...] for their freedom and liberty even when [...] "...their men..." [...] began to experience exhaustion from a long struggle for civil rights. These women were unafraid to stand up for what they believed in and refused to back down from the long and tedious [...] "battle". [...] Murray continued her praise <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>women</b> when she stated that [...] "...one cannot help asking: would the Negro struggle have come this far without the indomitable determination of its women?" [...] The [...] "Negro struggle" [...] was able to progress partly because of [...] "...the indomitable determination of its women." [...] African-American women were vital to the Civil Rights Movement and pushed it forward with their own might.

Joseph Vogel stated that her rising popularity {{towards the end of the}} decade was important for several reasons, [...] "not the least of which was how it coincided with (and spoke to) the rise of black feminism." [...] At a time when radio airplay and MTV primarily catered to white rock musicians, her album and its predecessor garnered widespread critical acclaim alongside other [...] "unprecedented breakthroughs" [...] by black women—including Alice Walker's The Color Purple (1982), Toni Morrison's Beloved (1987) and Patricia Hill Collins's Black Feminist Thought (1990)—musically capturing the spirit of the movement and presenting an alternate model on both womanhood and feminism to that of Madonna. Regarding her diverse appeal among youth, he also stated: [...] "Janet didn't have the vocal prowess of Whitney Houston, or the poetic subtlety of Kate Bush; she didn't have Annie Lennox's penchant for the avant-garde or Madonna's predilection for shock.
