5|$|Japan's {{population}} {{is expected to}} drop to 95 million by 2050; demographers and government planners are currently in a heated debate over <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> this problem. Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested {{as a solution to}} provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. Japan accepts an average flow of 9,500 new Japanese citizens by naturalization (帰化) per year. According to the UNHCR, in 2012 Japan accepted just 18 refugees for resettlement, while the United States took in 76,000.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as}} the most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E

5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You need to know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and {{wanted to have a}} good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E

The album was a massive multimillion-dollar success in France, Panama, Colombia and other countries. Héctor received instant recognition, steady work, and enough money to provide him with a comfortable lifestyle. According to Lavoe, it happened so fast {{he did not know}} <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> his sudden success.

Chai and Yang proposed a hidden Markov model-based method to extend labelled knowledge by leveraging the unlabelled user traces. J. Pan et al. propose to perform location estimation through online co-localization, and S. Pan et al. proposed to apply multi-view learning for migrating the labelled data to a new time period.|$|E

Some required skills in crossing roads or using buses, others had health problems {{that they needed to}} learn to manage. Small trial group homes were created within the hospital to allow each group of friends to learn to manage and nurses assisted patients to go shopping for food or clothes or to the cinema building confidence and skills.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{formally}} describe new optimization models for distributed telecommunication networks. Modern distributed networks put more focus on the processing of information and less on the actual transportation of datathan we are traditionally used to in telecommunications. This paper introduces new approaches for modelling decisionsupport at operational, tactical and strategic levels. This is done by first defining the technological framework we areworking within. One of the main advantages of this framework is its inherent flexibility, which enables us to do dynamicplanning and consider uncertainty when decisions are made. When we present the models, emphasis is placed on themodelling discussions around the shift of focus towards processing, the new technological aspects, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> utilizeflexibility <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> uncertainty. ...|$|R

[...] Consumers deserted the TS1000 once its novelty value had worn off and, as publishers of programming guides found to their cost, the American public showed little interest in using the machine to learn about computer programming.

Burned by this experience, many were unwilling to stock the later Timex Sinclair machines in large numbers and the big chain stores dropped the Timex Sinclair line altogether.|$|E

Howarth considered Todd's rationale for raping Marty to be complex. [...] "Todd was in love with Marty," [...] he said.
