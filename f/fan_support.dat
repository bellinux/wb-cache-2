5|$|Most pre-game {{media and}} popular {{coverage}} of the 2008 Orange Bowl focused on the matchup between Kansas's No.2 scoring offense and Virginia Tech's No.2 scoring defense. Outside factors, such as coaching, previous experience, and <b>fan</b> <b>support</b> were also considered in pre-game analysis of the matchup. Outside story lines included Virginia Tech's recovery from the Virginia Tech Massacre, recovery from late-season losses suffered by each team (against Missouri for Kansas and against Boston College for Virginia Tech).|$|E
5|$|In August 2017, the Sounds and Nashville SC, an {{expansion}} soccer {{team of the}} United Soccer League, reached a one-year agreement for Nashville SC to play its inaugural 2018 season at First Tennessee Park. <b>Fan</b> <b>support</b> of the team's games {{is expected to be}} a factor in Nashville's bid for a Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise. If the city was to be awarded an MLS team, First Tennessee Park would not be a viable location as the league requires soccer-specific stadiums for new franchises. Instead, the team would play at a new stadium, such as the 30,000-seat facility proposed for the Nashville Fairgrounds. Nashville SC is expected to play its first home game as early as March 2018.|$|E
5|$|The Penguins {{received}} continued <b>fan</b> <b>support</b> {{from their}} previous season. In addition to extending a home sellout streak to 72games on October 23, the Penguins ranked 113% {{above the national}} average for male television viewers aged 18 to 34. The franchise ranked as the 18th most valuable in the league at US$195million, marking a 26%increase from the past season. According to Forbes, the franchise's revenue would likely put the Penguins into the top ten after their new arena, Consol Energy Center, opened in 2010. The Penguins finished October with a 3–1–1 record in Pittsburgh and concluded the month with three consecutive road losses.|$|E

5|$|Despite a long {{scoreless}} {{streak to}} start the team's history, Toronto FC quickly began to establish itself as a club with significant <b>fan</b> <b>support.</b> The club's first win came on May 12, 2007 at BMO Field as Danny Dichio scored the club's first goal in the 24th minute of a 3–1 home win over the Chicago Fire. Though TFC slipped {{to the bottom of}} the MLS standings with a record of , the club built a foundation as the first Canadian team in MLS. In the club's second season in 2008, Toronto hosted the 2008 MLS All-Star Game. The team finished last in the Eastern Conference with a record of 9–13–8, but the enthusiastic fan base continued to fill BMO Field to capacity. To determine the Canadian Soccer Association's representative in the CONCACAF Champions League, Toronto FC played in the inaugural Canadian Championship in 2008 competing for the Voyageurs Cup. TFC were the favourites to win the championship in its first year, but the Montreal Impact prevailed.|$|E
5|$|Robertson {{averaged}} a triple-double {{for his first}} five seasons in the NBA with the Royals, recording averages of 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 10.6 assists per game. From the 1964–65 season on, things began to turn sour for the franchise. Despite Robertson's stellar play, never failing to record averages of at least 24.7 points, 6.0 rebounds and 8.1 assists in the six following seasons, the Royals were eliminated {{in the first round}} from 1965 to 1967, then missed the playoffs from 1968 to 1970. In the 1969–70 season, the sixth disappointing season in a row, <b>fan</b> <b>support</b> was waning. To help attract the public, 41-year-old head coach Bob Cousy made a short comeback as a player. For seven games, the former Celtics point guard partnered with Robertson in the Royals' backcourt, but they missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Several investors {{stepped forward}} with offers {{to buy the}} Buccaneers after Culverhouse's death, {{including}} Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, New York Yankees owner (and Tampa resident) George Steinbrenner, and Massachusetts developer Socrates Babacas. In response to the ensuing publicity, the trust administering Culverhouse's estate then issued a statement that the team was not for sale. They reversed their position two months later, as a poor early-season record led to declining <b>fan</b> <b>support</b> and revenues. The decision to sell the franchise came {{on the same day}} that Joy filed a $25 million claim against Hugh's estate. Hugh had paid $16 million for the franchise, which was now valued at $142 million. With Barnett Bank filing claims for $20.8 million against the Culverhouse estate, the trustees came very close to accepting Angelos' $200 million offer, which would have involved relocating the team to Baltimore, Maryland. Fearful of losing the team, civic leaders presented a proposal guaranteeing ticket sales of at least 55,000 for all home games for the next two years. The team was eventually sold to Palm Beach, Florida businessman Malcolm Glazer for $192 million, at that moment the largest price ever paid for a professional sports franchise.|$|E

5|$|The Rage were {{operated}} by a Dawson Creek-based non-profit group, the DC Rage Society. They obtained over $200,000 each year in financial support from the City of Dawson Creek who wanted the team to help fill the schedule of their new 6,500-seat arena. Compared to other NAHL teams, the Rage received above average <b>fan</b> <b>support</b> with over 1,000 people attending each game. With few of the players were native to the Peace Region, billet families housed team players {{while they were in}} town. The team participated in visits to local elementary schools, hosted meet-and-greets with community members, and fund-raised for the local branch of the Canadian Cancer Society and other charities. Likewise, the community supported the team by fund-raising for pay for general team activities and for a scholarship fund for players going onto university. In August 2011, the team took over hosting duties (from the city's minor hockey association) of Dawson Creek's annual week-long hockey camp in which 95 players attended, as well, in the same month, they hosted an open house for Dawson Creek community members meet the team.|$|E
5|$|Without Selänne for a {{full season}} in 2001–02, Kariya's points total {{continued}} to decrease. During the opening month of the campaign, he went ten consecutive game without a goal. Nevertheless, at mid-season, he was named to his sixth NHL All-Star Game in January 2002 (although it {{marked the first time}} he had been named to the All-Star Game without being voted in as a starter by fans). Kariya played on a line with Mario Lemieux and Joe Sakic (a trio that remained intact two weeks later for the 2002 Winter Olympics) and notched an assist in an 8–5 victory for the North American All-Stars. Shortly thereafter, Kariya played in his 500th career NHL game, against the Philadelphia Flyers, a contest in which he recorded a hat-trick to lead his team to a 5–4 win. Though he finished with a team-leading 57 points over 82 games, the 2001–02 season marked Kariya's worst statistical year as a Duck and the third-straight year his points total had decreased. The Ducks also suffered as a team, finishing with the third-worst record in the West. Losing <b>fan</b> <b>support,</b> the team drew the worst attendance in franchise history at home games during the season. During the season, he was often asked by reporters how long he was willing to remain with the Ducks while the franchise floundered. In the Canadian media especially, there was a widespread position that Kariya should be moved to a better club.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 the Concordes were {{renamed the}} Alouettes {{to attract more}} <b>fan</b> <b>support,</b> but the team folded the next year. The demise of the Alouettes forced the League to move its easternmost Western team, Winnipeg, into the East Division (it would stay there between 1987–94, 1997–2001, and once more from 2006–2013).|$|E

25|$|By 1995, the Rams {{franchise}} had withered {{to a mere}} {{shadow of}} its former self. Accusations and excuses were constantly thrown {{back and forth between}} the Rams fan base, ownership, and local politicians.

25|$|As {{the team}} transitioned into Raymond James Stadium for 1999, however, poor {{personnel}} moves (including the trading away of both Valderrama and Lassiter) led to decreased win totals {{which led to}} decreased <b>fan</b> <b>support.</b> Unable to find local buyers and hampered by an unfavorable lease agreement for Raymond James Stadium, the league folded the franchise in 2001.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the anticipated move to downtown San Francisco, the Giants' ownership also made a major personnel move to solidify <b>fan</b> <b>support.</b> Before even hiring a new general manager or officially being approved as the new managing general partner, Magowan signed superstar slugger free agent Barry Bonds away from the Pittsburgh Pirates, (a move which MLB initially blocked until some terms were negotiated to protect Lurie and Bonds in case the sale failed).|$|E

25|$|Although the Chicks won the championship, {{they had}} no local {{financial}} backing and could not compete with the American Association Milwaukee Brewers.
