5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} {{conspiracy}} theorists grossly overestimate {{the influence of}} ex-Nazis and neo-Nazis on American society, and point out that political repression at home and imperialism abroad {{have a long history}} in the United States that predates the 20th century. Some political scientists, such as Sheldon Wolin, have expressed concern that the twin forces of democratic deficit and superpower status have paved the way in the U.S. <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> of an inverted totalitarianism which contradicts many principles of Nazism.|$|E

5|$|The {{genetic code}} {{is a key}} part of the story of life. The main {{hypothesis}} for life's origin is the RNA world hypothesis. Any model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> of genetic code is intimately related to a model of the transfer from ribozymes (RNA enzymes) to proteins as the principal enzymes in cells. In line with the RNA world hypothesis, transfer RNA molecules appear to have evolved before modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, so the latter cannot be part of the explanation of its patterns.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{court in}} Bergen also started {{importing}} and translating the first true European literature that became {{available to a}} wider Norwegian audience. The literature which was popular then was heroic-romantic literature derived from the French and in turn English courts, notably chansons de geste around Charlemagne (the Matter of France) and tales of King Arthur (the Matter of Britain). The first work that was translated into Old Norse was reportedly the Arthurian romantic story Tristan and Iseult, which was finished in 1226 after orders from the young and newly-wed Haakon. Hákon's programme {{seems to have been}} the spark <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> of a new Norse genre of chivalric sagas.|$|E

Development of communication and transportation technologies made more efficient administration possible (and popularly requested) and democratisation and rationalisation of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everybody equally.|$|E

5|$|Reddy was succeeded as President by Giani Zail Singh who {{was sworn}} in on 25 July 1982.

Following his presidential term, the then Chief Minister of Karnataka Ramakrishna Hegde invited Reddy to settle down in Bangalore but he chose to retire to his farm in Anantapur. He died of pneumonia in Bangalore in 1996 at the age of 83. His samadhi is at Kallahalli near Bangalore. The Parliament mourned Reddy's death on 11 June 1996 and members cutting across party lines paid him tribute and recalled his contributions to the nation and the House.|$|E
5|$|World War I {{broke out}} in July 1914. By September 1914, the war had spread to Africa as the British and Belgians began a long {{military}} campaign against the German colonial army in German East Africa. In Nyasaland, the major effect {{of the war was}} massive recruitment of Africans to serve as porters in support of the Allied armies. Porters lived in extremely poor conditions which left them exposed to disease and mortality rates among them during the campaigns were high. At the same time, the recruitment of porters created a shortage of labour which increased the economic pressures on Africans in Nyasaland. Millenarians at the time believed that World War I would be a form of Armageddon, which they believed would destroy the colonial powers and pave the way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> of independent African states.|$|E
