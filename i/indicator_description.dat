40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} for evaluating research projects and programs. According our approach, the improvement might be achieved by adopting a results-based and a project portfolio approach, and assuring a research and technology development (RTD) indicators documentation through a standard and comprehensive <b>indicator</b> <b>description,</b> named indicator template. The results-based approach will assure a consistent indicators structure, according to the results chains and a strong connection between ex ante and ex post impact evaluation. The project portfolio approach will assure a tight integration of the research performance indicators, especially between policies goals and program results. And, finally defining a comprehensive indicator template {{it will be possible}} to understand better the indicators, develop a detailed analysis, based on the business intelligence techniques, such as OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing), data mining and text mining. According our knowledge the usage of this kind of techniques on RTD metadata is an innovative process. What we expect to find out is the indicators similarities and differentiations, the indicators clusters, the association between indicators, the most important input factors of indicators definition. According the results-based and project portfolio approach the discovered patterns will be evaluatedRDT indicator, RDT statistics, indicator template, data mining, text mining. ...|$|E

This context includes the patient group and the specific aspects of care of which the quality is aimed to be assessed. Methodological flaws like unreliable data and insufficient case-mix correction may confound the comparison of readmission rates between hospitals.

40|$|Problem/Condition: Promoting preconception health can {{potentially}} improve women's health and pregnancy outcomes. Evidence-based interventions exist to reduce many maternal behaviors and chronic {{conditions that are}} associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as tobacco use, alcohol use, inadequate folic acid intake, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. The 2006 national recommendations to improve preconception health included monitoring improvements in preconception health by maximizing public health surveillance (CDC. Recommendations to improve preconception health and health care-United States: a report of the CDC/ATSDR Preconception Care Work Group and the Select Panel on Preconception Care. MMWR 2006; 55 [No. RR- 6]). Reporting Period Covered: 2009 for 38 indicators; 2008 for one <b>indicator.</b> <b>Description</b> of Surveillance Systems: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected self-reported maternal behaviors, conditions, and experiences that occur shortly before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an ongoing state-based telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged 22 ̆ 030518 years in the United States that collects state-level data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic conditions, and preventive health services. This surveillance summary includes PRAMS data from 29 reporting areas (n = 40, 388 respondents) and BRFSS data from 51 reporting areas (n = 62, 875 respondents) for nonpregnant women of reproductive age (aged 18 - 44 years). To establish a comprehensive, nationally recognized set of indicators to be used for monitoring, evaluation, and response, a volunteer group of policy and program leaders and epidemiologists identified 45 core state preconception health indicators, of which 41 rely on PRAMS or BRFSS as data sources. This report includes 39 of the 41 core state preconception health indicators for which data are available through PRAMS or BRFSS. The two indicators from these data sources that are not described in this report are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing within a year before the most recent pregnancy and heavy drinking on at least one occasion during the preceding month. Ten preconception health domains are examined: general health status and life satisfaction, social determinants of health, health care, reproductive health and family planning, tobacco and alcohol use, nutrition and physical activity, mental health, emotional and social support, chronic conditions, and infections.

Health has been defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (WHO, 2007, p. 1). With such an encompassing definition of health, quality of life issues have increasingly gained importance in health practice and research. The concept of health-related quality of life (HRQL) includes the dimensions of physical function, psychological function, social function, and health perceptions (Wilson & Cleary, 1995). These dimensions, in turn, guide the conceptualization of HRQL measurements [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A {{hierarchical}} {{and standardized}} environmental disturbance index, {{specifically designed for}} karst landscapes, was created by van Beynen and Townsend (2005). To assess {{the applicability of the}} index and provide recommendations for its refinement, the index was applied in four west-central Florida counties and interviews were conducted with local and state officials, community planners, and land resource managers. The karst disturbance index consists of 30 indicators contained within five broad categories: geomorphology, hydrology, atmosphere, biota, and culture. Data was readily available for most environmental indicators used to construct the index. Overall, levels of disturbance vary between the counties due to the level of urbanization, with the highly populated Hillsborough and Pinellas Counties having higher degrees of disturbance than less developed Pasco and Hernando Counties. While this result may seem obvious, the measure of disturbance using many indicators provides benchmarks of levels of disturbance that can be reassessed with time and highlights those aspects of the environment most in need of attention. Several minor issues arose during the testing: the need for broader <b>indicator</b> <b>descriptions</b> that encompass a variety of scenarios, a new water quality indicator, obsolete sinkhole data, and a lack of data for biota indicators.
