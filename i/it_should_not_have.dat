5|$|After filming commenced, Paramount Pictures {{brought in}} two African-American {{consultants}} {{to review and}} approve the depiction of the black characters: Willis Edwards, {{vice president of the}} local NAACP chapter, and David L. Crippens, the vice president and stage manager of the local PBS affiliate. In the end, they walked away with different views of the film. Crippens did not find the film to have any racist connotations, while Edwards found it inflammatory and felt <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been made, particularly not during that year, when a series of murders of black children was occurring in Atlanta. The two men provided a write-up of their views for the studio executives, which were passed to Davison along with warnings that the studio feared a film boycott. But Fuller was neither told of these discussions, nor given the notes, until two weeks before filming was slated to conclude. Known for being a staunch integrationist and for his regularly giving black actors non-stereotypical roles, Fuller was furious, finding the studio's actions insulting. He reportedly had both representatives banned from the set afterwards, though he did integrate some of the suggested changes into the film.|$|E
25|$|From 1999, the {{non-governmental}} organization Catholics for Choice lobbied against {{the participation of}} the Holy See in the United Nations. Supporters of this campaign argued that the Holy See is a religious organization and not a state, and that, therefore, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the right to participate, in a position analogous to that of states, in the intergovernmental decision-making process on social, cultural, and economic matters. They also cited the lack of equal status for other religions and the Vatican representatives' history of pushing Catholic views on reproductive health.|$|E
500|$|Thinking {{of music}} in terms of basic elements, Jewel would tell the {{director}} that for certain scenes, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> bass since, as an earth tone, it is usually used for a more emotional or ominous part. Jewel thought the music {{should be in the}} upper register and relaxing for the [...] "dreamlike" [...] scene. To help himself with the music composition process, and to conjure up melodies, the producer would highlight many phrases from the novel, then print those words in large font, and hung them on his walls or draw pictures during viewings of Drive.|$|E

500|$|Early reviews were mixed. Some critics {{found the}} novel too preachy; others, {{including}} Leonard Woolf, {{thought it was}} poorly structured, or complained of sloppiness in style. There was praise for its sincerity and artistry, and some expressed sympathy with Hall's moral argument. In the {{three weeks after the}} book appeared in bookstores, no reviewer called for its suppression or suggested that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been published. A review in T.P.'s & Cassell's Weekly foresaw no difficulties for The Well: [...] "One cannot say what effect this book will have on the public attitude of silence or derision, but every reader will agree with Mr. Havelock Ellis in the preface, that 'the poignant situations are set forth with a complete absence of offence.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Within a {{few weeks}} of signing with London, the A member who was {{negotiating}} with Sleep had been transferred and replaced. After sending the finished album to London Records, the label told Sleep that {{they were not going to}} release the album in its current format. London Records had David Sardy remix the album but the label were still confused as to what to do with the album. Sleep refused to have the album released in any edited form which led to a deadlock between London and the band. The members of Sleep have mixed feelings whether the album should have been released in general. Cisneros felt <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been released while Pike was content with its release, saying [...] "We did all the work so why leave it sitting around?" ...|$|E
500|$|Rossio and Marsilii {{believe that}} many of the {{negative}} reviews of Déjà Vu are a direct result of Scott's direction of the film, and have stated that [...] "Tony Scott added nothing to Déjà Vu and made several hundred small mistakes and about eight or nine deadly mistakes", which makes the film seem like it has many unforgivable plot holes, when <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> had any. [...] "here are no plot holes at all, and scrutiny reveals the plot to be air tight." [...] says Rossio. [...] "We had years to think of all this and work it out." [...] It was felt there were many misunderstandings that Scott's take on the plot introduced into the film. In his own defense, Scott cited in an interview with Iain Blair of BNET that only nineteen weeks were provided for the production of the film, which [...] "isn't a lot for a film like Déjà Vu." ...|$|E

500|$|The Daily Record {{also said}} {{ever since the}} Buckton family arrived they [...] "created drama", noting it was Ruby and Charlie especially. All About Soap {{questioned}} whether [...] "poor Ruby" [...] would ever find a [...] "good bloke" [...] to pair up with. They also said <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been to hard for Ruby with all the [...] "surfer types". Holy Soap later said [...] "If there's one thing that Ruby seems to have inherited from Charlie, it's her sometimes questionable taste in men." [...] When Ruby impressed everyone with her singing voice, the Daily Record said [...] "there is actually a rather pleasant storyline involving Ruby". They described the week Ruby slept with Romeo as an eventful one for her and opined she was on [...] "cloud nine". Debbie Schipp writing for Adelaide's Sunday Mail brands Ruby [...] "a low-down boyfriend-stealer" [...] for her affair with Romeo. Caroline Fitton writing for Daily Mail observed Ruby as being [...] "self-absorbed". TV Week said the [...] "impulsive teen" [...] waited until Romeo dropped his guard and [...] "moved in for the kill", but had her [...] "head in the clouds". They correctly predicted it would end [...] "messy". They also showed Ruby little sympathy when she told Indigo about her affair and lost her friends. They said: [...] "The salient lesson here is: don't cop off with your best mate's boyfriend, so you're just gonna have to ride this one out, Rubes." [...] Peter Dyke writing for the Daily Star said Ruby is a [...] "randy schoolgirl" [...] and said that her romance with Casey was merely a [...] "passionate rebound romp". Whilst Erin Miller of TV Week said: [...] "Phew, it's {{hard to keep up}} with Ruby's romantic escapades lately!" [...] In April 2011, TV Week said Ruby had become [...] "increasingly trouble-prone" [...] and concluded that [...] "belle in blue Charlie is at her wits' end {{about what to do with}} her wayward daughter".|$|E
2500|$|At a {{press conference}} that {{occurred}} after the hangings Mahathir criticised {{the use of the}} word [...] "barbaric" [...] and said <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been used to refer to Malaysia because [...] "we have never had any lynchings and things like that which only barbarians like to do." [...] He also said that hanging as a method of executing criminals originated in the West.|$|E
2500|$|The 2014 MI5 website {{addresses}} the matter specifically, {{stating that the}} original investigation lasted from 1964 to 1971 but [...] "came to no firm conclusions" [...] and that Trend's report concluded [...] "there was no {{evidence to show that}} either Hollis or Mitchell had been Soviet agents". It continues that there was a 1988 internal review which concluded the original case was [...] "so insubstantial that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been pursued".|$|E

2500|$|One tax scheme {{involved}} Barclays claiming <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to pay {{corporation tax}} on profits made when buying back its own IOUs. The second tax avoidance scheme, also designed by Barclays, involved investment funds claiming that non-taxable income entitled the funds to tax credits that could be reclaimed from HMRC. The treasury described this as [...] "an attempt to secure 'repayment' from the Exchequer of tax {{that has not been}} paid".|$|E

The [...] "101" [...] aircraft had undergone a major overhaul in December 2009, and Alexey Gusev, the head of the maintenance plant that carried out the work, told Polish TV that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> had technical problems.

2500|$|Regrettably, {{despite the}} best efforts, the refereeing process cannot be 100% effective. Thus the paper ... {{made it through the}} review process even though, in retrospect, it does not meet the {{standards}} expected of articles in this journal... The paper was discussed extensively at the annual Editorial Board meeting ... and there was general agreement that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been published. Since then several steps have been taken to further improve the peer review process in order to improve the quality assessment on articles submitted to the journal and reduce the likelihood that this could happen again.|$|E

2500|$|The P.10 made a {{big impact}} at the 1919 Paris show, with Flight {{describing}} it as [...] "the machine of the show". [...] Nonetheless, after the show the P.10 disappeared from sight.

2500|$|The {{paper in}} {{question}} has, however, not been withdrawn by the journal. Later, {{the editor-in-chief of}} the journal issued a slightly different statement {{on behalf of the}} Institute of Physics, which owns the journal, in which he insisted on the fact that their usual peer-review procedures had been followed, but no longer commented on the value of the paper. In particular the sentences [...] "...it does not meet the standards expected of articles in this journal" [...] and [...] "The paper was discussed extensively at the annual Editorial Board meeting ... and there was general agreement that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been published" [...] were removed. [...] The former phrase was, however, quoted in the New York Times, the Chronicle of Higher Education and Nature. Moreover, Die Zeit quoted the journal's co-editor Hermann Nicolai as saying that had the paper reached his desk, he would have immediately rejected it.|$|E
2500|$|In the Navy's view, the {{evolution}} of the armored cruiser from the New York and Brooklyn to the Tennessee class was a progression toward [...] "what was in reality a battle-cruiser." [...] As such, it claimed, the Tennessees [...] "excelled in battery power and protection any armored cruiser built, building, or designed, in the world at that time." [...] The issue of speed did not go away and the Tennessees were criticized within the Bureau of Construction and Repair for being slower than their British and French counterparts. Engineer in Chief Melville stated in his minority report, [...] "I cannot believe that Congress did not intend that these vessels should be equal to or superior to any of their class, that class being armored cruisers, and not battleships where very high speed may not be so essential; and I am not at all certain that an additional knot and the power for <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been insisted upon in the first place." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1923, Courtneidge and Hulbert {{appeared}} in The Little Revue, produced by Hulbert. The Times {{wrote of the}} show, [...] "there {{is no reason why}} <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a dozen successors, all as good." [...] There were, in fact, five successors, described by Pepys-Whiteley as [...] "a series of uninterrupted successes throughout eight years, in which both partners had star parts." [...] These shows played in the West End and on tour in the UK, and in 1925 the Hulberts made their Broadway debut in their current revue, By-the-Way. The New York Times found the show [...] "beguiling". The fourth in the series, Clowns in Clover, contained one of Courtneidge's most celebrated sketches, [...] "Double Damask", by Dion Titheradge, in which her character, Mrs. Spooner, and two shop assistants become entangled in tongue-twisters. When Courtneidge's 1932 recording of the sketch was reissued in 1972, The Gramophone said, [...] "it is an enduring classic comedy sketch as funny now as it was then".|$|E
2500|$|This {{ceiling was}} done {{at the time the}} new Chapel was built. It would not have been {{possible}} to remove a wood and plaster ceiling entire, or even in pieces, and re-erect it, and there would have been no need for an expensive model if the old vaulting had been in the College, ready to put up again. Also, the entry of 18 June 1659, [...] "began to plaster the Chapel roof" [...] which, doubtless, refers to the panels of plaster between the wood ribs. It may be objected that this is very late for a fan-vaulted roof, and so it would be anywhere but in Oxford. The fan-vaulting in St. Mary's Porch was done in 1637, and the great fan-vaulted staircase at Christ Church was not done until 1640. So there is no reason at all why <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> seemed quite the natural thing to cover even a partially Renaissance building in this manner, especially one with so much Gothic feeling about its windows.|$|E
2500|$|The {{study was}} poorly {{received}} by {{a portion of}} the Romanian cultural environment, who objected to the revelations about the direct connections between various interwar intellectuals and fascist groups such as the Iron Guard. Rejecting accusations that he was diverting focus from the negative impact of communism, Ornea stated that he had simply carried on with research that would have been censored under Ceaușescu: [...] "I continued my exegesis on the currents of though of the interwar. In 1980 I published a book on the twenties, named Tradiționalism și modernitate în deceniul al treilea. I could not, at the time, advance in this field because I could not write with probity about totalitarianism under totalitarian currents of thought. [...] In autumn 1990 I returned to the interwar period [...] There was not a single malevolent intent in doing so. I purely and simply carried on with an exegesis I had begun earlier". His preface for one edition of the book further explained this rationale: [...] " [...] could not be published because it was impossible to properly comment on the ideas of totalitarianism and the single party [...] of parliamentary democracy [...] And <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been published then because it unveiled the political credo of those who, back in the thirties, were the prominent personalities among the new generation (Mircea Eliade, Emil Cioran, Constantin Noica and others). It was untimely because it would have provided arguments for not publishing their work (which, in any case, was always subject to the uncertain status of accidental tolerance). And I figured, like so many other intellectuals, that the work of these personalities should have, by all means, been published. I therefore postponed the writing of this book for settled times placed under a more fastidious sign".|$|E
