According to Shanker, many behaviour, mood, emotional, learning and developmental problems are caused or exacerbated by an overactive stress system. Shanker proposes a method, called Self-Reg, for managing stress and energy flow {{in order to reduce the}} impact of an overactive stress response system on children’s day-to-day functioning and development. The method starts with reframing children’s behaviour and emotional problems as stress problems and identifying and reducing stressors in the five domains discussed in Calm, Alert and Learning. The book identifies hidden stressors that affect some children in our society and also discusses the epidemic of stress and anxiety in today’s children and parents.|$|E

Parents should not force the child to sit, crawl, or walk a certain way during this age period. Let the child do what’s comfortable for them and allow the therapist to correct this problem. If you want to <b>help</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> walk more, then push toys are recommended for walking aids. Regular exams should be done to make sure the child’s legs are growing normally and he or she is not having any problems with the hip.|$|E
