40|$|Background: Wild mallards (Anas platyrhychos) are {{considered}} one of the primary reservoir species for avian influenza viruses (AIV). Because AIV circulating in wild birds pose an indirect threat to agriculture and human health, understanding the ecology of AIV and developing risk assessments and surveillance systems for prevention of disease is critical. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, mallards were experimentally infected with an H 4 N 6 subtype of AIV by oral inoculation or contact with an H 4 N 6 contaminated water source. Cloacal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, fecal samples, and water samples were collected daily and tested by real-time RT-PCR (RRT-PCR) for estimation of viral shedding. Fecal samples had significantly higher virus concentrations than oropharyngeal or cloacal swabs and 6 month old <b>ducks</b> <b>shed</b> significantly more viral RNA than 3 month old ducks regardless of sample type. Use of a water source contaminated by AIV infected mallards, was sufficient to transmit virus to naïve mallards, which shed AIV at higher or similar levels as orally-inoculated ducks. Conclusions: Bodies of water could serve as a transmission pathway for AIV in waterfowl. For AIV surveillance purposes, water samples and fecal samples appear to be excellent alternatives or additions to cloacal and oropharyngeal swabbing. Furthermore, duck age (even within hatch-year birds) may be important when interpreting viral shedding results from experimental infections or surveillance. Differential shedding among hatch-year mallards could affect prevalence estimates, modeling of AIV spread, and subsequent risk assessments...|$|R

The FAdV- 4 strain was characterized as a novel genotype based on the specific genome characteristics. However, {{our understanding of the}} dynamic distribution, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis of the novel FAdV- 4 is incomplete. In this study, a new, sensitive and FAdV- 4 -specific real-time PCR was developed and applied to detect the dynamic distribution of the duck origin, novel FAdV- 4 strain HLJDAd 15 in experimentally infected special-pathogen free (SPF) chickens and ducks. Notably, the pathogenicity and replication pattern of HLJDAd 15 were completely different between chickens and ducks. Severe hydropericardium and 10 % mortality were induced in chickens, whereas no clinical signs were observed in any duck. The virus replicated was detected throughout the study in both chickens and ducks. However, only one replication peak with a high virus concentration appeared in chickens at 5 days post infection (dpi), whereas two peaks with relatively low virus titres appeared in ducks at 7 and 21 dpi. Thus, ducks could be a natural reservoir of the novel FAdV- 4 absent of clinical signs, and a new transmission route from <b>ducks</b> <b>shedding</b> FAdV- 4 continually to chickens was revealed, which might aggravate the outbreak of HHS in chickens.

As the 2006 / 2007 isolates differ phylogenetically from the 2003 / 2004 isolates, we assessed the clinical responses of chickens, ducks and quails to intranasal inoculation of the 2006 / 2007 index case virus, A/chicken/Korea/IS/ 06. All the chickens and quails died on 3 days and 3 - 6 days post-inoculation (DPI), respectively, whilst the ducks only showed signs of mild depression. The uninoculated chickens and quails placed soon after with the inoculated flock died on 5. 3 and 7. 5 DPI, respectively. Both oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were taken for all three species during various time intervals after inoculation. It was found that oropharyngeal swabs showed higher viral titers than in cloacal swabs applicable to all three avian species. The chickens and quails shed the virus until they died (up to 3 to 6 days after inoculation, respectively) whilst the <b>ducks</b> <b>shed</b> the virus on 2 - 4 DPI. The postmortem tissues collected from the chickens and quails on day 3 and days 4 - 5 and from clinically normal ducks that were euthanized on day 4 contained the virus.

Well treated drinking water (8 log 10) leads to a negligible infection risk of individual chickens or humans. It was assumed that a single infected <b>duck</b> was <b>shedding</b> H 5 N 1 AIV in surface water used for drinking water production, after treatment resulting in consumption of contaminated water by chickens or humans. At 8 log 10 treatment, the estimated daily infection risk of an individual chicken is low, 10 ^- 15 - 10 ^- 10, reflecting the large uncertainties in viruses shedding and infectivity (10 ^- 5 - 1). Nevertheless, the 2000 farms with more than 10000 chickens (74 % of all Dutch farms), may run a high risk (more than 1 %) if the virus is highly infectious and treatment is less than 4 log 10. Assuming a low virus infectivity (10 ^- 5), the average daily infection risk for humans by consumption of contaminated drinking water was estimated as low as 2 x 10 ^- 12, and by surface water recreation as low as 10 ^- 8.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{feathers of}} domestic {{ducks and geese}} inoculated with 2 different avian infl uenza virus (H 5 N 1) genotypes. Together with virus isolation from the skin, the detection of viral antigens and ultrastructural observation of the virions in the feather epidermis raise the possibility of feathers as sources of infection. Since 1997, an epidemic of avian influenza (AI) virus subtype H 5 N 1 has spread in Asia, causing fatal infections in poultry, wild birds, mammals, and humans (1). Wild waterfowl, including ducks and geese, are natural hosts of AI virus of all 16 hemagglutinin subtypes in nature (2, 3). Generally, AI virus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route without causing clinical signs (2 – 4). Although current AI virus (H 5 N 1) strains have mild to severe pathogenicity in waterfowl (5 – 7), these birds can still be carriers of the virus (7). Even asymptomatic domestic <b>ducks</b> can <b>shed</b> the virus from the cloaca and oral cavity (7, 8) and contribute to viral maintenance and spread (9, 10). Therefore, focusing on the epidemiologic role of domestic waterfowl in AI (H 5 N 1) outbreaks is important. We previously reported that the Japanese AI virus (H 5 N 1) isolated in 2004 causes necrosis of the feather epidermis with viral antigens in domestic ducks, a finding that demonstrates the possibility of viral release from feathers (11). In addition, these affected feathers can cause infection in orally inoculated domestic ducks (12). Except for our previous studies, to our knowledge this feather lesion has not been reported in AI (H 5 N 1) –infected waterfowl. However, if the feather lesion is common to other waterfowl species and AI (H 5 N 1), affected feathers might involve {{the spread of the}} virus.

A total of 1800 1 -d-old Cherry Valley ducks were randomly divided into 5 groups (A, B, C, D and E) with 360 ducks in each. To obtain objective data, each group had three replications. Concentrations of airborne bacteria, fungi, endotoxin in different groups were created by controlling ventilation and bedding cleaning frequency. Group A was the control group and hygienic conditions deteriorated progressively from group B to E. A 6 -stage Andersen impactor was used to detect the aerosol concentration of aerobes, gram-negative bacteria, fungi and AGI- 30 microbial air sampler detect the endotoxin, and Composite Gas Detector detect the noxious gas. In order to assess the immune function of meat ducks, immune indicators including H 5 AIV antibody titer, IgG, IL- 2, T-lymphocyte transformation rate, lysozyme and immune organ indexes were evaluated. Correlation coefficients were also calculated to evaluate the relationships among airborne bacteria, fungi, endotoxin and immune indicators. The results showed that the concentration of airborne aerobe, gram-negative bacteria, fungi, endotoxin have a strong correlation to H 5 AIV antibody titer, IgG, IL- 2, T-lymphocyte transformation rate, lysozyme and immune organ indexes, respectively. In addition, when the concentration of microbial aerosol reach the level of group D, serum IgG (6 - 8 weeks), lysozyme (4 week) were significantly higher than in group A (P < 0. 05); serum IL- 2 (7 and 8 weeks), T-lymphocyte transformation rate, lysozyme (7 and 8 weeks), spleen index (6 and 8 weeks) and bursa index (8 week) were significantly lower than in group A(P < 0. 05 or P < 0. 01). The results indicated that a high level of microbial aerosol adversely affected the immune level of meat ducks.

Estimating the efficiency and importance of such cross-species transmission using epidemiological approaches is difficult. We therefore addressed this question by studying transmission of low pathogenic H 5 and H 7 viruses from infected ducks to other common animals in a quasi-natural laboratory environment designed to mimic a common barnyard. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) recently infected with H 5 N 2 or H 7 N 3 viruses were introduced into a room housing other mallards plus chickens, blackbirds, rats and pigeons, and transmission was assessed by monitoring virus <b>shedding</b> (<b>ducks)</b> or seroconversion (other species) over the following 4 weeks.

Virus antigens were {{detected}} in feather epidermal cells from days 3 through 6 pi, {{and in a}} few stromal cells in the feather pulp on days 3 and 4 pi (online Appendix Figure, panel C). Our results indicate that larger amounts of viruses can be isolated for a longer time from feathers than from swabs. Therefore, feathers can be considered useful samples for surveillance or diagnostic examination of AI virus (H 5 N 1) in domestic ducks. The epidermis, the outer layer of the feather, is a tissue that has poor host immune response against viral replication (8). As has been observed in virus isolation, viruses may be able to survive longer in differentiated epidermal tissue such as contour feathers. The sensitivity of the rapid test was not adequate for swabs, a finding similar to that of other studies (9, 10). However, positive results for rapid tests of feather samples only may shed light on the on-site field detection of AI (H 5 N 1) in asymptomatic domestic <b>ducks.</b> When virus <b>shedding</b> from domestic <b>ducks</b> is maintained at a low level of viral load during the infection, selecting the sample with higher viral load and antigens in tissues, such as feathers, can increase the detection rate obtained from on-site examination.

40|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of avian H 5 N 1 influenza viruses to mammals {{has been}} evolving since the mid- 1980 s. Here, we demonstrate that H 5 N 1 influenza viruses, isolated from apparently healthy domestic ducks in mainland China from 1999 through 2002, were becoming progressively more pathogenic for mammals, and {{we present a}} hypothesis explaining the mechanism of this evolutionary direction. Twenty-one viruses isolated from apparently healthy ducks in southern China from 1999 through 2002 were confirmed to be H 5 N 1 subtype influenza A viruses. These isolates are antigenically similar to A/Goose/Guangdong/ 1 / 96 (H 5 N 1) virus, which {{was the source of}} the 1997 Hong Kong “bird flu” hemagglutinin gene, and all are highly pathogenic in chickens. The viruses form four pathotypes {{on the basis of their}} replication and lethality in mice.

Five of six H 5 N 1 isolates tested replicated in inoculated <b>ducks</b> and were <b>shed</b> from trachea or cloaca, but none caused disease signs or death.

By bridging the disciplines of Urban Planning, Urban Design and Architecture, the thesis investigates design solutions to the issues of urban mobility and complex urban networks (of pedestrians, trains, bicycles, cars, buses, goods, etc.). The opportunity adopted in this exploration is the Boston Urban Ring Bus Rapid Transit proposal. The project presents major socioeconomic opportunities both at the urban and architectural scale for the City of Cambridge and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The design proposal is a mixed-use transit hub, which will layer disparate programs such as a transit station with institutional, residential and commercial uses, thereby generating a 24 - 7 activated space {{in the center of the}} MIT campus. The spatial conditions are informed by the evolving fluxes and flows of users, which change according to time, season and program.

40|$|A {{variety of}} factors are thought to {{contribute}} to the pathogenesis of avian influenza (AI) viruses. Three of these factors: host, immunity and virus strain, were studied. Specifically, tissue tropism in hosts usually regarded as resistant to infection with HP AI viruses; the effect of prior immunity on infection; the effect of age on disease outcome and the genetic factors of the virus were studied. The ability of "Asian- lineage" A/turkey/Turkeyll/ 2005 (H 5 Nl) HPAI virus (clade 2. 2) virus to produce disease and mortality in Pekin ducks was affected by the age at infection. In 4 - week-old Pekin ducks, infection resulted in systemic infection, severe neurological signs and 100 % mortality. Viral shedding was primarily from the oropharyngeal route. Only mild clinical signs and no mortality was observed in 12 -week-old ducks infected with the same dose of this virus. Clinical signs and mortality rates in 8 - week-old ducks were similar to those observed in 4 -week-old <b>ducks,</b> but viral <b>shedding</b> and virus loads in tissues were shown to be lower, and generally absent in brain and heart tissues in both age groups of older ducks. Prior infection of 3 -week- old ducks with a low pathogenicity AI (LP AI) H 5 N 2 virus and subsequent challenge at 7 - and 16 -weeks-old with A/turkey/Turkey/ 1 / 2005 HPAI H 5 Nl was shown to decrease the severity of clinical signs and the amount of virus shed, although in this particular study mortality was observed in neither prior infected or naive birds on challenge. Viral genetic markers for virulence of HP AI viruses in chickens were studied in two genetically similar HP AI H 5 Nl viral clones - A/turkey/England/ 50 - 92 /l 991 2 L and A/turkey/England/ 87 - 9211991 LDP 3, which displayed high and low virulence in intravenous pathogenicity (IVPI) tests with indices of 1. 77 and 0 respectively. Ten amino acid differences in five genes - PB 1, PB 2, PA, HA and NP, were identified between these two isolates. Nine of these differences, the exception being the one in the NP gene, were shown {{to contribute to the}} high virulence of the 2 L clone since they were induced in the low virulence LDP 3 clone after intracerebral passage in day-old chicks and led to a change in phenotype to a high IVPI score. Two mutations in PBl unique to LDP 3, located in a known functional domain involved in the binding ofPBl to both PB 2 and vRNA, were shown to reduce 2 L polymerase function significantly in chicken cells when measured by an in vitro polymerase activity assay. This finding highlights the important contribution of polymerase function to the virulence of AI viruses. The results from the present study collectively highlight the complex polygenic nature of HP AI virus infections in avian hosts. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
