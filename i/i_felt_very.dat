Madonna pursued the part of Breathless Mahoney, {{offering}} to work for scale. Her resulting paycheck for the film was just $35,000. Sean Young claims she was forced out of the role of Tess Truehart (which eventually went to Glenne Headly) after rebuffing sexual advances from Beatty. In a 1989 statement, Beatty said, [...] "I made a mistake casting Sean Young in the part and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> badly about it."

500|$|To {{prepare for}} her role, Moore visited strip clubs in New York City, California, and Florida, and {{she met with}} strippers. Moore really did dance topless in the part, {{and this was the}} sixth time she showed her breasts on film. She also read the novel, exercised, and practiced yoga. Moore was cast before other {{important}} parts were cast, creating some interest in the project. In the first attempt at filming Moore stripping, two hundred actors were used to portray the audience. Although their salaries were small, many accepted the role to see Moore nude. After waiting for a while, when Moore finally appeared and started dancing the crowd turned so loud and wild that the shooting had to temporarily cease. As Moore said, [...] "After my experience, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> confident." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{scholars}} and critics challenge {{the validity of}} Pinter's critiques of what he terms [...] "the modes of thinking of those in power" [...] or dissent from his retrospective viewpoints on his own work. In 1985, Pinter recalled that his early act of conscientious objection resulted from being [...] "terribly disturbed {{as a young man}} by the Cold War. And McCarthyism... A profound hypocrisy. 'They' the monsters, 'we' the good. In 1948, the Russian suppression of Eastern Europe was an obvious and brutal fact, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> strongly then and feel as strongly now that {{we have an obligation to}} subject our own actions and attitudes to an equivalent critical and moral scrutiny."

Hunter Davies, who was at Jim's house at the time doing an interview for his Beatles' biography, remembered Jim listening to an acetate disc of [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four". Davies wrote that Paul recorded the song specifically for his father, as Jim was then 64 years old and had married Angela two years previously. Paul wrote [...] "Let It Be", because of a dream he had in 1968. He said that he had dreamt of his mother, and the [...] "Mother Mary" [...] lyric was about her. He later said, [...] "It was great to visit with her again. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> blessed to have that dream. So that got me writing 'Let It Be'." ...|$|E

John Lutz appears {{as the mother of}} his character, TGS writer J.D. Lutz, but it is unclear whether this is portrayed as a casting joke on the part of 30 Rock or whether the character of Lutz is impersonating his own mother within the show. In addition, actress Novella Nelson guest starred as herself as Tracy Jordan's fake [...] "mother" [...] for the first time. Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin played himself in the episode as it is revealed that he was in a relationship with Liz's mother. In an interview with TV Guide in discussion of his guest spot, Aldrin said [...] "That was wonderful, carrying on a conversation with very professional actors I greatly admired. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> honored to be paired up with something that also has another connection to me.

500|$|While {{media reports}} {{initially}} suggested that Abhishek Bachchan was being considered {{to portray the}} role of Vijay Chauhan, director Karan Malhotra approached Hrithik Roshan for the role. Roshan, however was sceptical on taking up a role earlier played by Amitabh Bachchan and agreed to star in the film only after months of deliberation. He said, [...] "The script had so much passion that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> emotional and I {{made up my mind}} to do it". [...] On casting Hrithik, Malhotra explained, [...] "Hrithik has the charm of a boy and the attitude of a man. Also, he has a certain vulnerability, which I was looking in my characterisation of Vijay Dinananth Chauhan." [...] While explaining the character of Vijay Chauhan, Malhotra added, [...] "Nobody can play Vijay the way Amitabh Bachchan did, and I would have wanted my Vijay to be subtle even if it wasn't Hrithik. I wanted the negative characters in my film to be bigger. This made Hrithik's victory seem bigger." [...] In preparation for the film, Roshan did not look up Bachchan's performance in the original for inspiration, as he considered his role to be completely different. Roshan, however, faced several difficulties while filming. He suffered from a severe back injury, which caused him considerable pain, throughout the shooting schedule. In an interview with Filmfare he quoted, [...] "Agneepath is the hardest I’ve ever worked in my life. I didn’t know what the film had in store for me. I’ve never been so tired in my life.

Thompson asked Joe Boyd to produce these sessions, and two days were spent on the initial recordings. Boyd recalls that the sessions were not a success: [...] "It was really, <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>very</b> poor. I didn't have much confidence in the musicians that he was working with.

Nevertheless, McCartney explained that his mother – who died of cancer when he was fourteen – was the inspiration for the [...] "Mother Mary" [...] lyric. He later said: [...] "It was great to visit with her again. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> blessed to have that dream. So that got me writing 'Let It Be'."

They found a prominent position at the court of Louis Philippe King of the French, whose wife [...] Queen Maria Amelia, was an aunt of Infanta Luisa Carlotta. The Duchess of Dino who met Don Francisco de Paula and his family at the French court, described them as follows: [...] " [...] The Infanta is very fair, with a face which, though washed out, is none the less stern, with a rough manner of speaking. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> ill at ease with her, although she was very courteous. Her husband is red-haired and ugly, and the whole tribe of little infantes, boys and girls, are utterly detestable". Meanwhile, in Spain, General Espartero, credited for the victory over the Carlists in 1839, took the post of prime minister. He soon became virtually a dictator, and forced Queen Maria Cristina to resign the regency, sending her to exile in France in October 1840. Maria Cristina's fall from power opened the door for Infante Francisco de Paula return to Spain.|$|E

He had seen this as a child, although Nimoy's father had told him not to look as they performed the blessing. This became the basis for the Vulcan salute. Solow later said that Nimoy was the key contributor to the character's depiction, saying that the [...] "Mr Spock character was 20% created by Gene Roddenberry, 20% created by me and 60% created by Leonard Nimoy". Nimoy recalled, [...] "As a Jew from Catholic Boston, I understood {{what it was like to}} feel alienated, apart from the mainstream... there were a number of values in Star Trek that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> comfortable with as a Jew".

2500|$|It was at {{this time}} that he became {{interested}} in the foundations of mathematics, particularly after reading Bertrand Russell's The Principles of Mathematics (1903), and Gottlob Frege's The Foundations of Arithmetic, vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903). Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics. He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a [...] "constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation." [...] In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the University of Jena to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing. He wrote: [...] "I was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never talk about anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schwartz {{said that}} {{inspiration}} for the show came from being a fan of Larry Sanders, Cameron Crowe and other [...] "quirky character-driven shows like Freaks and Geeks, Undeclared, and My So-Called Life". Schwartz went to college at the University of Southern California School of Cinema-Television, and later said that The O.C. was [...] "very much based on sort of the experiences I had when I was in college" [...] as a [...] "Jewish kid from the East Coast ... surrounded by all these kids from Newport Beach who were water-polo players, and these very blonde girls who only wanted to date them. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> much like an outsider." [...] Although Orange County residents criticised the show's title, stating that people did not call the county by the phrase, Schwartz claims that USC students did {{say that they were}} from [...] "The O.C."
