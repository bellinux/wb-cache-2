500|$|In 2010 at St. Thomson's Cathedral, Aya and Kyle {{were going}} to be married. The Cathedral was {{attacked}} by a SWAT team and Aya was killed. Eve attempted to save Aya by sending her consciousness into Aya's body, creating the Overdive ability. The event caused Aya's consciousness to separate from her body and fragment through time to create the Twisted, Eve's consciousness to become trapped in Aya's body, and parts of Eve's body to be transplanted into people close to the pair to create the High Ones. The [...] "Aya" [...] of the main story is in fact Eve in Aya's body. After these revelations, Eve returns to her body and is asked by Bohr to assimilate him and trigger the birth of a new species. Eve refuses, and when Bohr tries to force the process, a reborn Aya shoots him to death. Aya then reveals that to avert the birth of the Twisted and High Ones, the sources (Aya and Eve) must be removed. Expressing her regret at not being able to marry Kyle, she tells Eve to shoot her. In a fit of emotion, Eve switches bodies with Aya before shooting her, creating a new timeline where Eve's body and Aya's consciousness do not exist, erasing the game's events. Though Eve offers to marry Kyle, he refuses and hints that he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Aya. In a post-credits sequence four years after the game's events, Eve is walking the streets of New York and is wished a [...] "Happy Fourth Birthday" [...] by a woman resembling Aya.|$|E

Then, anyway, I'm too stiff and sore to fight. And then, he has no {{business}} to think he owns the Old Pasture, because he doesn't. I have just as much right here as he has. Yes, Sir, I have just as much right in this Old Pasture as he has, and if {{he thinks he can}} drive me out he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> that he was never more mistaken in his life! I'll show him! Yes, Sir-e-e, I'll show him! I guess my wits are as sharp as his, and I wouldn't wonder if they are a little bit sharper." ...|$|E
6000|$|Socialism {{would open}} the way to vast public corruption. This is flatly opposed to the {{experience}} of America, where local administration has been as little Socialistic and as corrupt as anywhere in the world. Obviously in order that a public official should be bribed, there must be some wealthy person outside the system to bribe him and with an interest in bribing him. When you have a weak administration with feeble powers and resources and strong unscrupulous private corporations seeking to override the law and public welfare, the possibilities of bribing are at the highest point. In a community given over to the pursuit of gain, powerful private enterprises will resort to corruption to get and protract franchises, to evade penalties, to postpone expropriation, and they will do it systematically and successfully. And even where there is partial public enterprise and a competition among contractors, there will certainly be, at least, attempts at corruption to get contracts. But where the whole process is in public hands, where can the bribery creep in; who <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the money for the bribes, and why? ...|$|E

However, I packed my [...] valise (my new one that cost me a dollar thirty-five, although [...] Wilson says it is worth the money) {{and the next day}} I took the [...] cars for Boston on a ticket I got at cut rates, although it was [...] tolerably dear even at that. When I got to Boston I introduced [...] myself to Mr. Phil Newell, the one-legged man you used to work [...] for, and he took me to police headquarters, and now I am [...] stopping here at a boarding-house on Hammond Street. The police [...] sent a detective to me, and he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> them heirlooms [...] and that rascal of a Deck Mumpers, or whatever his name is, or [...] know the reason why. If he finds the things, I'm to give him [...] two hundred dollars in cash; if he don't, I pay his travelling [...] expenses and no more. I wouldn't make such a bargain, but I [...] know all you boys want the things back and I can't do the [...] running after the thief. It's a waste of money, but it can't be [...] helped. I want to show you and Ben and Larry that your uncle [...] means well in spite of what you think of him.|$|E
