That night, she hunted in the {{approaches}} to Rabaul and between there and the Duke of York Islands. On the night of 1-2 June, while patrolling on the Rabaul-New Hanover line, she was spotted by two Japanese destroyers, but no attacks were made. On 3 June, the submarine began hunting along the northern coast of New Britain. On 4 June, west of the Willaumez Peninsula, she developed motor trouble and turned for Vitiaz Strait, {{one of the few}} areas for which she carried charts. On 5 June, she entered the strait, and on 7 June, she commenced patrolling between Cape Cretin and the south end of Dampier Strait. Two days later, she was ordered to intercept Japanese destroyers thought to be heading for Lae on an <b>estimated</b> <b>course</b> which would take them north of Woodlark Island.|$|E
40|$|Growth curves {{based on}} the Richards {{function}} are evaluated for four highly inbred tines of fowl (F,> 99. 9 p. 100) {{and some of their}} F, hybrids. The largest deviations of the <b>estimated</b> <b>course</b> of growth (maximum: 9. 3 p. 100) in terms of live weight occurred before 6 weeks of age; inbred and hybrid groups showed a tendency to deviate in opposite direction as a result of differences in adaptive behaviour during the posthatching period. Another deviation in some groups was an overestimation of the asymptote in relation to the observed values for final weight. Interline differences occurred in age and weight at the inflection point, the asymptotic weight, the shape of the curve and the parameters of the growth rate. The overall evaluation of lines and hybrid combinations showed that, except for the proportion of asymptotic weight reached at the inflection point, the genetic variation in these parameters was showed significant heterosis in growth rate and in relatively high.

40|$|Introduction: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the impact of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) on AIDS mortality, taking into account earlier HIV incidence patterns. Methods: Using AIDS Surveillance data (1982 - 2000), we calculated the observed course of the AIDS epidemic among homosexual men in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. We used the HIV incidence patterns (1980 - 2000) among homosexual men participating in the hepatitis B vaccine trial and the Amsterdam Cohort Study and those attending the Amsterdam sexual transmitted infections clinic, together with the time from seroconversion to AIDS and death in the pre-HAART era, to estimate the natural course of the AIDS epidemic if HAART had not been introduced. Results: The <b>estimated</b> <b>course</b> of the AIDS epidemic without the benefits of HAART showed a decline in AIDS mortality, but this estimated decline was not as strong as the observed decline. Taking into account the HIV incidence over calendar time, we estimated that 331 deaths among homosexual men were prevented by HAART between 1996 and 2000 in Amsterdam. Conclusion: The decline in AIDS mortality was the result of both HAART and a decline in the HIV incidence in the early 1980 s. When evaluating the effect of HAART on mortality, changes in HIV incidence must also be considere...|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} project {{documentation}} and implementation depend on an effective collaboration within project teams. However, fragmentation {{has been a}} major concern in the industry for many centuries. Evidence suggests that this phenomena challenge weakens value integration among project teams; and regrettably, most academic programs are still tailored to service this limitation. As BIM is driven by integrative skills, this paper describes the formulation of an academic course for a multidisciplinary and integrative study of an <b>estimating</b> <b>course.</b> Specifically, it is targeted at a class of undergraduate students with backgrounds in project team disciplines - architecture, quantity surveying, structural and services engineering. The focus is to engage students in collaborative learning such that they are able to develop technical briefs, design tender programs, estimate and analyze tenders. A model for formulating groups and group assignments is proposed. In the end, study outcomes reveal that students will be multi-skilled and better team players than those under fragmented learning environments. Conclusions are drawn on curriculum development for integrative innovations such as BIM and virtual project management...|$|R

30|$|For instance, Lee and Dossick (2012) {{analyzed}} various {{applications of}} BIM in CEM programs from the literature, {{and established a}} BIM educational program in their curriculum for educating students that would be well prepared for the construction industry. The study indicated that the CEM curriculum was designed by educationalists with courses in numerous categories, such as stand-alone BIM courses, MEP lab courses, engineering graphics courses, cross-curriculum teaching modules, capstone <b>courses,</b> scheduling and <b>estimating</b> <b>courses,</b> and project management courses. The study also suggested introducing general types of BIM technology to support the CEM curriculum with 3 D visualization, 4 D scheduling, 5 D estimation, and laser scanning technology, and described further on how to integrate BIM into other CEM courses such as construction contracts, construction surveying, facility management (FM), construction safety, construction estimating, construction planning and scheduling, project administration, capstone courses, and integrated studios. In the same series of studies, Lee et al. (2013) further conducted research with a main objective of identifying the best approach to incorporate BIM into the CM curricula at East Carolina University and University of Washington. Here, Lee et al.’s study mainly reported on some published cases, learning outcomes, challenges of BIM in construction education, and associated industry perspectives. They also developed detailed guidelines for integrating BIM technical and management skills into construction education.|$|R

Since the torpedo travels relatively slowly, the torpedo course must be set not toward the target, but toward where the target will be when the torpedo reaches it. Target angle is used to <b>estimate</b> target <b>course.</b>|$|R
