40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the problem of work-life balance. Nowadays more and more {{benefits}} is being perceived that stem from implementation of the industrial culture based on balance between work and life. On the other hand there are various limitations which in some cases hinder. One of such barriers lays in the process of communication. Moreover, the article discuss the process of gaining competitive advantage on the ground of the idea of work-family balance. The idea seems to be positive especially for the <b>employees,</b> <b>organisation</b> and even the whole society, since it can prevent the phenomenon of professional burnout. It also helps to maintain the most efficient and the best among the employees, who are intentionally aimed at achieving their goals in professional and personal life. The work- -family balance programmes can make a positive impact on the firm’s reputation and its perception by potential employees. The pregnant women and young parents are presented as a group most interested in those flexible solutions and the programmes prepared for them in LG Electronics, IBM, Decora SA, IKEA, BZ WBK, Volkswagen Motor Polska are examined...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} be written {{as a part}} of my Ph. D. {{research}}. Old firms in the Netherlands' which is a research project in the theme of the demography of firms in the research school Systems, Organizations and Management from the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. The demography of firms is relatively new in the Spatial Sciences but nevertheless this is a subject with a long history in other fields of research. The demography of firms is the study of the changes in the population of firms with the use of demographic tools. This field of research can broaden our knowledge of regional-economic dynamics of firms. Other disciplines that investigated this subject are mostly interdisciplinary, using combinations of methods and theories from sociology, economy, demography and geography. In this paper, the focus will not be on the theoretical background of firm demography, but on the dynamics of the survival of firms. This is part of the 'narrow' definition of firm demographics in Economic Geography as mentioned above. This definition includes birth, death, migration and survival in the population of firms. In this paper, the emphasis will be on the exploration of the definition of 'old' {{in the context of the}} firm lifecycle. This will be done using a chronological description of Dutch firm activity in the period from the industrial revolution until the present, and by a representation of the location of firm establishments in maps during this period. Furthermore, a list provided by the Dutch Chamber of Commerce of the 500 oldest establishments in the Netherlands at present will be compared with these maps to get more insight in the 'survival rates of firms in the different industrial sectors. One of the difficulties here is the definition of ''old'' in the context of the firm lifecycle. When is a firm old? Is it possible to characterise a firm on the basis of age in years, or can this only be done in relationship to the age of the attributes (products, <b>employees,</b> <b>organisation</b> or establishment) which form the company? To define the firm just by age in years can be problematic because in this way no attention will be given to the stage of development a firm is in. This development of the firm can be seen when one looks at the age of a company according to the product-lifecycle, in which a firm is not mature until it reaches the fourth stage of this cycle. Right now, this last view is less useful, either because practice shows that some firms are in different stages of the product-lifecycle at the same time, some firms stay in the same phase constantly or some firms start their product-cycle in a different phase than the first. Another difficulty is the question of what constitutes a firm. Does the company's name, the product it produces, or the legal status the company has, constitute it as being a firm? The list of the 500 oldest firms used in this paper is based on the age of the settlement. Of course, this is not the most perfect solution for this problem, but it does give an impression of the age and concentration of firms in the Netherlands in the time period from the industrial revolution until the present. Also, the problem with this data is that it does not include data on the firms' migration. In addition, it would be better to compare different lists from different institutions, but at present these data are not available. The goal of analysing this data is to get more insight into the definition of the concepts ''firm'' and ''old'', as used in the Ph. D. research project "Old firms in the Netherlands. " A second goal is to get a preliminary idea of how the population of old firms is dispersed over the Netherlands, how the population is divided over the different industrial sectors and how the age pyramid of this population of firms is composed. In this context it is important to know how the division of the firms was during the Industrial Revolution in the Netherlands and whether or not the current situation is comparable. This last comparison will provide an insight into the different rates of survival of firms in the different industrial sectors. ...|$|E

40|$|How do you {{systematically}} inspire <b>employees</b> and <b>organisations</b> {{in large}} mature companies {{to participate in}} innovation initiatives? In May 2010 the Volvo Group hosted their first ever virtual idea generation event on a Group-wide level. In preparation for this event an extensive campaign was launched to communicate, inspire and motivate innovation commitment among <b>employees</b> and <b>organisations.</b> The event was called VGBI LIVE and {{was the result of}} an innovation framework calles Volvo Group Business Innovation. In the past, a small team of innovation coaches within Volvo Technology have conducted internal idea generation events (i. e. ideation events). Their experiences led them to understand that the participants generally needed to be inspired and motivated prior to the events. Our assignment was to provide and prototype and ideal formula for how to do just this. In collaboration with Volvo Technology, this study aimed to: Identify and prototype a method of communicating a new innovation initiative. Inspire <b>employees</b> and <b>organisations</b> to commit and participate in an online enterprise-wide ideation event. Ultimately, to conceptualise the prerequisites for enterprise-wide creativity and innovation, and provide an ideal formula for the ICEP innovation model. Clear cut best practices of how to perform these initial phases of innovation initiatives are far and wide apart. By conceptualising innovation as organisational change we were granted new perspectives and tools (West, 2002). In this endeavor we utilised Design Thinking as a strategic resource (Brown, 2009) and internal branding as a strategy and change facilitator (Mahnert & Torres, 2007). Our research questions were: How do you systematically inspire <b>employees</b> and <b>organisations</b> in large companies to participate in innovation initiatives? Can brands, through internal branding, motivate and inspire <b>employees</b> and <b>organisations</b> to be more creative or voluntarily express their creativity? How can Design Thinking be utilized as a strategic resource in an innovation process...|$|R
