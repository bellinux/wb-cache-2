40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the issues of}} designing the two-zone digital microwave sensors for the car alarm systems with high stability characteristics and capable of adaptation to external noise. The existing analog circuit-based microwave sensors for car alarm systems {{have a number of}} essential drawbacks: [...] high level of intrinsic noise to cause the "false" alarm of response sensors; [...] non-stable characteristics caused by the application of analog components at the environmental temperatures from - 30  tо + 60  С. This requires sensor readjustment during the transition from the summer season to the winter one, that is, essentially, hard to implement; [...] uneasy adjustment of a mounted sensor with variable resistors; [...] adjustment characterstic nonlinearity and high power consumption; [...] impossible to implement the auto-compensation and adjustment algorithms to the repetitive external actions. To overcome abovementioned drawbacks the paper offers a circuit of digital microprocessor-based (PIC 12 F 683 processor) sensor with HF oscillator running in pulse operation mode (pulse ratio 20). It allows 6 - 8 times decrease of power consumption up to 2. 1 mA and twice reduction of noise amplitude. Filters with useful output signal are of digital implementation. This enables us {{to reduce the number of}} electric components of sensor in half and to increase characteristics stability. For remote adjustment of sensor (with the key fob of car alarm or by GSM link) 16 gradations of sensitivity are entered for zones of warning and alarm. The reference levels of <b>digital</b> <b>comparators</b> at each gradation of sensitivity are so generated that the sensor has a linear adjustment characteristic (distance of movable object detection versus gradation number). An application of digital signal processing and sensor capability of data exchange with the main alarm module through the bus allows us to implement the original algorithm of automatic correction of sensitivity across the warning zone of sensor. It means that the sensitivity gradually decreases under repetitive external effects (downpour, passing cars in the streets with heavy traffic, etc.) and with returning to the level of preliminary adjustment as the intensity of external effects decreases.

The DFC loop, which uses variable time period to estimate and tune {{the frequency of}} the digitally controlled oscil-lator (DCO), enhances the resolution of frequency detection. The conventional phase-frequency detector (PFD) and programmable divider are replaced with a <b>digital</b> arithmetic <b>comparator</b> and a DCO timing counter.

A threshold region is set in the remainder vector to reduce the influence of jitter variation in frequency detection. The loop stability can be retained by cas-cading two DFC loops when the multiplication factor () is large.

OTFT {{suffer from a}} relatively large Vt variation due to the bias stress effects, and process mismatch variations. Though these effects are also prevalent in silicon based transistors, their magnitude is comparatively larger {{in the case of}} OTFT. This renders the well-established silicon based circuits unsuitable for organic electronics. Therefore, direct adaptation of the silicon based circuits for realising organic circuits does not effectively handle the relatively large parameter and mismatch variations associated with OTFT. In this work, we first investigate the bias-stress induced threshold voltage (Vt) variation and process variations to understand the impact of these variations on the performance of organic circuits. Then, two different strategies were employed to design robust organic circuits.
