50|$|The society first {{appeared}} in the American Psychological Association as a section under the division of clinical psychology (Division 12) in 1962. As research in child development and behavior analysis progressed, the need for specialized training for clinical psychology students became more urgent. Conferences were held in the mid-1980s onward to discuss the material needed to treat children. By the next <b>decade,</b> <b>Division</b> 12 considered the possibility of clinical child psychology becoming its own division; and after a vote of the section members, the APA Council created the Division of Clinical Child Psychology (Division 53) in 1999. John Weisz became the first Division President the following year and the division went through a name change the year after that and maintains that title to the present day.|$|E

However the rivalry was finally laid to rest and there was union under the newly named African National Congress. One of the early aims of this movement was finally to lay to rest [...] "the aberrations of the Xhosa-Fingo feud." ...|$|R

50|$|Greenland {{left the}} European Economic Community in February 1985, principally due to EEC {{policies}} on fishing and sealskin. Most EU laws {{do not apply}} to Greenland; however, owing to its connection with Denmark, Greenland continues to enjoy preferential access to EU markets. In the same year, Greenland exercised its new control over the Royal Greenland Trading Company to reestablish it as KNI. Over the next few <b>decades,</b> <b>divisions</b> of the conglomerate were slowly spun off and competition within the Greenlandic economy somewhat increased.|$|R

50|$|By {{the end of}} the <b>decade,</b> the <b>division</b> {{began to}} slim its model lineup.

After 1999, the Tracer was discontinued; the Mystique was removed from production early in the 2000 model year.|$|R
40|$|For <b>decades,</b> <b>division</b> is {{the most}} time {{consuming}} and expensive procedure in the Arithmetic and Logic Unit of the processors. This paper proposes a novel division algorithm based on Ancient Indian Vedic Mathematics Sutras which is much faster compared to conventional division algorithms. Also large value for the dividend and the divisor do not adversely affect the speed as time estimation of the algorithm depends {{on the number of}} normalizations of the remainder rather than on the number of bits in the dividend and the divisor. The algorithm has exhibited remarkable results for conventional midrange processors with numbers of size around 50 bits(15 digit numbers), the upper ceiling of computable numbers for conventional algorithms and the algorithm can divide numbers having size up to 38 digits (127 bits) with conventional processor in the present form, if modified it can divide even bigger numbers...|$|R
