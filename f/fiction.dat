5|$|Authentic Science <b>Fiction</b> was a British science <b>fiction</b> {{magazine}} {{published in}} the 1950s that ran for 85 issues under three editors: Gordon Landsborough, H.J. Campbell, and E.C. Tubb. The magazine was published by Hamilton and Co., and began in 1951 {{as a series of}} novels appearing every two weeks; by the summer it became a monthly magazine, with readers' letters and an editorial page, though <b>fiction</b> content was still restricted to a single novel. In 1952 short <b>fiction</b> began to appear alongside the novels, and within two more years it completed the transformation into a science <b>fiction</b> magazine.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} nature and {{theoretical}} import of a hitherto neglected class of <b>fictions</b> which we term ‘self-involving interactive fictions’ (SIIFs). SIIFs are interactive <b>fictions,</b> but they differ from standard examples of interactive <b>fictions</b> by being, in some important sense, about those who consume them. In order {{to better understand the}} nature of SIIFs, {{and the ways in which}} they differ from other <b>fictions,</b> we focus primarily on the most prominent example of the category: video-game <b>fictions.</b> We argue that appreciating the self-involving nature of video-game <b>fictions</b> is key to understanding various otherwise puzzling phenomena concerning the ways in which consumers respond to them. Video-game <b>fictions</b> are, however, far from being the only extant example of this class; and we suggest that the recent philosophical interest in video games would be better focused on the wider class of self-involving interactive <b>fictions...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Legal <b>fictions</b> {{derive their}} {{legitimacy}} from tradition and precedent, rather than formal standing {{as a source}} of law. Historically, many legal <b>fictions</b> were created as ad hoc remedies forged to meet a harsh or an unforeseen situation. Conventions and practices over the centuries have imparted a degree of stability both to the institution of legal <b>fictions</b> and to specific legal <b>fictions</b> (such as adoptions and corporate personhood) that have been repeatedly invoked in judicial precedents. While judiciaries retain discretion in the use of legal <b>fictions,</b> some general propositions regarding the appropriateness of using legal <b>fictions</b> might be expressed as follows: ...|$|R

5|$|Harry became {{interested}} in science <b>fiction</b> and read comics by candlelight (as the house had no electricity), eventually joining the Liverpool Science <b>Fiction</b> Society. At the age of 13, he produced his own science <b>fiction</b> fanzine, Biped, using a Gestetner machine to print 60 copies. His pen friend {{at the time was}} Michael Moorcock; the writer of science <b>fiction</b> and fantasy novels.

40|$|Before {{the era of}} reform, {{the common}} law was replete with <b>fictions.</b> The {{procedure}} by which litigation commenced in the common law courts was premised on <b>fictions,</b> while litigants also used <b>fictions</b> to enable themselves to avail themselves of convenient remedies. In allowing litigants to make false statements of facts, the courts allowed the law to develop in new directions, while disguising {{the fact that it}} was changing. However, there were also other kinds of <b>fictions,</b> which operated more like rules of law. They included ‘metaphysical’ <b>fictions</b> (as where something which no longer existed was deemed still to be in existence) as well as ‘fictions’ which were in effect metaphors or analogies. This chapter explores the operation of these <b>fictions,</b> as well as the criticisms and defences made of <b>fictions</b> before their nineteenth century reform...|$|R

The Special Issue is the first international peer reviewed journal on this burgeoning design practice. The article {{is an attempt to}} grapple with the notion of Design <b>Fictions</b> and considers this a ‘speculative turn’ within contemporary design practice. It presents Design <b>Fictions</b> as a cluster of problems, rather than offering a single definition of Design <b>Fictions</b> it outlines their ‘multidimensionality’ to suggests that Design <b>Fictions</b> create a discursive space within which new forms of cultural artefact (futures) might emerge...|$|R
40|$|I {{critically}} examine {{some recent}} {{work on the}} philosophy of scientific <b>fictions,</b> focusing {{on the work of}} Winsberg. By considering two case studies in fracture mechanics, the strip yield model and the imaginary crack method, I argue that his reliance upon the social norms associated with an element of a model forces him to remain silent whenever those norms fail to clearly match the characteristic of <b>fictions</b> or non-fictions. In its place, I propose a normative epistemology of <b>fictions</b> which clarifies a model's ontological commitments when the community of scientists lack any clear, shared norms of use. Specifically, I will introduce a variational account of <b>fictions</b> as an extension of Laymon's monotonic improvability account of idealizations. I will conclude by connecting this variational account of <b>fictions</b> to didactic <b>fictions</b> in general...|$|R

40|$|Chinese <b>fictions</b> {{translated}} into English during the Anti-Japanese War {{to the establishment}} of the People’s Republic of China are not paid enough attention. Besides, researches on the selection of Chinese <b>fictions</b> {{translated into}} English are few. The present studies are limited to the selection of individual works translated into English, which cannot reflect the impact of the socio-cultural contexts in the selection of Chinese <b>fictions</b> translated into English in a specific historical period. Hence, this paper will explore the content, characteristics and influences of the selection of Chinese <b>fictions</b> translated into English by foreign translators during the Anti-Japanese War up until {{to the establishment of}} the People’s Republic of China. The study found that the selection of Chinese <b>fictions</b> translated into English by foreign translators involves historical themes, ways of the world themes, rural themes, people’s living themes, and war themes. The selection of Chinese <b>fictions</b> translated into English by foreign translators has the following characteristics: the close interaction between the selection of Chinese <b>fictions</b> and the socio-political and cultural development, the highlighting of personal ideology of the foreign translators, etc. This study helps to promote Chinese studies and the canonization of Chinese <b>fictions</b> in the English world, and to reconsider the studies on translation norms in the Chinese academics.

5000|$|In an {{alternative}} reading, Karla F. C. Holloway's Legal <b>Fictions</b> (Duke University Press, 2014) suggests a different composition for the tradition and argues its contemporary vitality. Her thesis is that legally cognizable racial identities are sustained through constitutional or legislative act, and these nurture the [...] "legal fiction" [...] of African-American identity. Legal <b>Fictions</b> {{argues that the}} social imagination of race is expressly constituted in law and is expressively represented through the imaginative composition of literary <b>fictions.</b> As long as US law specifies a black body as [...] "discrete and insular," [...] it confers a cognizable legal status onto that body. US <b>fictions</b> use that legal identity to construct narratives — from neo-slave narratives to contemporary novels such as Walter Mosley's The Man in My Basement - that take constitutional <b>fictions</b> of race and their frames (contracts, property, and evidence) to compose the narratives that cohere the tradition.|$|R

40|$|The {{exceptional}} {{quality of}} digital <b>fictions</b> lies in their inherently dynamic nature, how {{they may be}} flexibly programmed to generate new content and alter the already existing contents. This adds a new temporal level, compared to traditional <b>fictions.</b> Digital games, especially, incorporate aspects of simulation and narration in their structure. As interactive and dynamic media form, games are specifically temporal in nature. They offer us the flexibility and preciseness of digital simulations, with the potential of psychologically engaging narrative qualities, which together open {{up a whole new}} field of experimenting with temporally dynamic media. Much of the new media <b>fictions</b> partake in a wider transmedia story worlds with temporal implications of their own. In this article the temporal dimension of the digital <b>fictions</b> the Braid (by Jonathan Blow, 2008) and the Spore (by Will Wright for Maxis, 2008) are discussed.
