500|$|Bridges {{opined that}} Tron: Legacy was evocative {{of a modern}} myth, adding that ideas {{alluding}} to technological advancement were prevalent throughout the film. To Cyriaque Lamar of io9, the film's approach to technology was reminiscent of a kōan. [...] "One {{of the things that}} brought me to this film," [...] affirmed Bridges, [...] "was the idea of helping to create a modern-day myth to help us navigate through these technological waters [...] <b>I</b> <b>dig</b> immediate gratification as much as anybody, but it happens so fast that if you make a decision like that, you can go far down the wrong path. Think about those plastic single-use water bottles. Where did that come from? Who decided that? You can have a couple of swigs of water [...] and those bottles don't disintegrate entirely. Microscopic animals eat the plastic, and the fish eat those, and we're all connected. It's a finite situation here." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} writing songs for ...Is a Real Boy, Bemis stated, [...] "The songs were jam packed with fairly blatant nods to bands <b>I</b> <b>dig</b> (Queen, Saves the Day, Pavement, Faith No More, Fugazi, etc)." [...] These can be {{considered}} some of Say Anything's influences. Other influences at some point cited by the band include Botch, Weezer, The Stooges, Neutral Milk Hotel, Sunny Day Real Estate, Wilco, and the Foo Fighters. Also of note, the band has covered songs by Ol' Dirty Bastard ("Got Your Money"), Notorious B.I.G. ("No Soul" [...] contains the same hook as the sample in [...] "Juicy" [...] although it adheres more closely to the original song [...] "Juicy Fruit" [...] from which the sample for the Notorious B.I.G. song was taken), The Four Tops ("Sure, Baby...Hold Back" [...] features a chorus lifted from [...] "Sugar Pie Honey Bunch"), Safety in Numbers ("Dealer"), Saves the Day ("Jessie and My Whetstone"), and Bob Dylan ("The Man in Me").|$|E

500|$|Critics have {{credited}} Age of Empires for influencing real-time strategy (RTS) games such as Rise of Nations, Empire Earth, and [...] [...] {{was also}} influenced by the series: it utilized the Genie game engine, as Age of Empires and Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings had, and was considered by critics {{to be a very}} close replica to the games; IGN began their review with the statement [...] "I love Age of Star Wars, I mean Star Empires. Whatever it's called, <b>I</b> <b>dig</b> it." [...] and GameSpot wrote that [...] "fundamentals of the Age of Empires II engine are so intact in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds that veterans of that game can jump right in." [...] In October 2005, Shelley commented on the impact of the series. In a GameSpy interview, he explained that parents would [...] "tell Ensemble Studios that their kid is reading books about ancient Greece because they enjoy playing with the triremes so much, or that they want to check out books about medieval history because [...] game taught them what a trebuchet was." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for The Spokesman-Review, Isamu Jordan said, [...] "I'll be honest. <b>I</b> <b>dig</b> the little yellow dude {{who lives in}} a {{pineapple}} under the sea quite a bit for his absurdity À la Ren and Stimpy." [...] He said that [...] "season two is worth having in your or your kid's SpongeBob collection" [...] given that the episodes [...] "Krusty Love", [...] "Squid's Day Off", and [...] "Mermaidman and Barnacleboy III" [...] are on the set. Jason Bovberg of the DVD Talk wrote that the season release is [...] "recommended." [...] He said [...] "Let me state up front that I adore this show. I get a total kick out of watching it with my 4-year-old daughter. We laugh uproariously at SpongeBob's adventures and I'm helplessly reduced to a boy about her age as I beam and giggle at the screen." [...] However, Bovberg called the included audio commentaries [...] "downright boring." [...] Various celebrities—including Lance Bass of 'N Sync, Will Ferrell of Saturday Night Live, singer-songwriter Tom Waits, and Jerry Lewis—admitted they were fans of the show.|$|E
2500|$|Leng writes that, {{with the}} {{repeated}} declaration of [...] "I dig love every morning / <b>I</b> <b>dig</b> love every evening", Harrison's lyrics reflect the [...] "loosening of social taboos {{about sex and}} sexuality", an issue {{that was at the}} forefront of the 1960s countercultural revolution. While also viewing the lyrics as a marked departure from the predominantly spiritual themes found on All Things Must Pass, theologian Dale Allison describes [...] "I Dig Love" [...] as an endorsement of that era's free love movement. Leng cites lines from the song's first verse as being a mix of [...] "Pseudo-Dylanesque wordplay" [...] and [...] "George's schoolboy jokes": ...|$|E

2500|$|While the Indonesian band Kekal {{has been}} labeled as unblack metal, the band has distanced {{itself from the}} movement. When {{asked if he was}} bothered {{by the fact that the}} first black metal bands were against Christianity, front-man Jeff Arwadi replied: [...] "I think you're wrong if first black metal bands were highly against Christianity. [...] <b>I</b> <b>dig</b> the very first black metal bands a lot... those 80s bands like Venom, Bathory, Hellhammer/Celtic Frost, early Sodom, etc. [...] By my knowledge, none of those bands were against Christianity. They only had those kind of 'satanic' image which is more like some high-school Halloween movies or parent-shocker rather than Satanism as a {{philosophy}} or ideology". Earlier in the interview he even went as far as to say that [...] "even bands like Celtic Frost were once considered 'white-metal' from some 'true' black metal fans because the band thanked God on album thanks list, and one member wearing a cross necklace instead of inverted cross. It's a totally relative issue, depending on how 'extreme' you would go, right?" [...] Whereas Arwadi claimed that to his knowledge, [...] "none of those bands were against Christianity", Bathory founder Quorthon rejected Christianity in numerous interviews.|$|E
