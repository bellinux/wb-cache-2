40|$|Abstract. Cardiac {{catheter}} ablation is a minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>medical</b> <b>procedure</b> {{to treat}} patients with heart rhythm disorders. It {{is useful to}} know {{the positions of the}} catheters and electrodes during the interven-tion, e. g. for the automatization of cardiac mapping. Our goal is therefore to develop a robust image analysis method that can detect the catheters in X-ray fluoroscopy images. Our method uses steerable tensor voting in combination with a catheter-specific multi-step extraction algorithm. The evaluation on clinical fluoroscopy images shows that especially the extraction of the catheter tip is successful and that the use of tensor voting accounts for a large increase in performance. ...|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{pilot and}} test the {{feasibility}} of a novel technology to reduce anxiety and pain associated with an <b>invasive</b> <b>medical</b> <b>procedure</b> in children with cancer. Method Children with cancer (ages 7 – 19) whose treatment protocols required access of their subcutaneous venous port device (port access) {{were randomly assigned to}} a virtual reality distraction intervention, a non–virtual reality distraction, or treatment as usual without a distraction. The researchers obtained assessments of the child 2 ̆ 7 s pain and anxiety from the parent, child, and unblinded nurses. Pulse rate was monitored throughout the procedure, and behavioral indices of distress were recorded, as observed by the researchers. Results Reductions in pain and anxiety were found for children who used the virtual reality distraction in comparison with the no distraction condition as evidenced by lower pulse rate and reports of pain by nurses. No significant differences were found for the non–virtual reality condition versus the no distraction condition on pulse rate. Conclusions These findings suggest that virtual reality may be a useful tool for distraction during painful medical procedures, but further studies are needed to test potential efficacy and feasibility during other, more distressing medical procedures with larger sample sizes...|$|E
40|$|Neonatal sepsis occurs from 1 to 21 newborns out of 1 000 {{live births}} with {{mortality}} rates {{as high as}} 30 % up to 69 %. The most important risk factors are prematurity, low birth weight, <b>invasive</b> <b>medical</b> <b>procedure</b> and prolonged hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units. An aimed and restrictive antibiotic therapy has an outstanding importance to reduce both morbidity-mortality rates and multiple drug-resistance. Generally, preterm newborns present nonspecific clinical signs of infection. The use of high sensitivity infection markers and a negative predictive value (near 100 %) are important to distinguish infected and noninfected patients before the culture results and to verify adequacy and duration of antibiotic therapy. This article reviews the immunologic function and practical use of C reactive protein (CRP) and other markers in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. While CRP is a specific late infection marker, cytokines, cell surface markers and procalcitonin (PCT) are early infection markers. The use of multiple markers as CRP, PCT, IL- 6, IL- 8, CD 64, CD 11 b is useful both to early (24 - 48 h) diagnose of neonatal sepsis, and to monitorate the antibiotic treatment {{while waiting for the}} results of cultural examinations...|$|E
40|$|State-of-the-art {{three-dimensional}} endo-luminal virtual colonoscopy (VC) or CT colonography (CTC) is a minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>medical</b> <b>procedure</b> {{that examines}} the entire colon {{in order to}} detect polyps and colorectal cancer. Most colon cancers malignantly transform from polyps, which are extra growths {{on the surface of}} the mucous membrane. Three dimensional endoscopic colon lumen interior images offered by CTC allow physicians to examine the colon interactively. Thus, CTC has several advantages over conventional optical colonoscopy including reduced risk. One of the challenging problems that prevent practical use in clinical situations is the complexity of the human colon. The colon’s deformation by peristalsis and the diverse shapes of polyps make it difficult to distinguish polyps from other non-threatening entities in the colon. Hence, most CTC protocols acquire both prone and supine images to improve the visualization of the lumen wall, reduce false positives, and improve sensitivity. Comparisons between the prone and supine images can be facilitated by computerized registration between the scans. In this dissertation, two algorithms for registering colons segmented from prone and supine images are presented. First is an algorithm for three dimensional registration of the prone and supine colon when both are well distended and there is a single connected lumen. Second is another registration algorithm between colons wit...|$|E

40|$|Good {{nutritional}} status of the patient is very often key to successful medical intervention. For patients capable of safe and efficient swallowing, the modification of diet or introduction of oral nutritional supplements is sufficient. In patients with swallowing disorders, regardless of their aetiology, artificial nutrition access is required. In the case of long-term nutritional therapy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion is considered the gold standard. The procedure of inserting a PEG feeding tube is not difficult to perform and is widely used. As any <b>invasive</b> <b>medical</b> <b>procedure,</b> PEG tube insertion involves the risk of complications. Typical complications that may follow this common procedure include dislodgement, dysfunction, skin infection in the area of PEG catheter placement and aspiration of gastric contents. A rare or rather rarely diagnosed complication {{that may result}} from PEG tube placement is the migration of the internal bumper under the gastric mucosa, or even deeper. This can result in the covering of the internal bumper with granulation tissue and gradual loss of its functionality. Correct prevention and treatment allows to keep the catheter functionality and protect against other serious, often life-threatening, complications such as extensive phlegmon infection of the anterior abdominal wall. The best prophylaxis is the education of caregivers providing long-term care of the PEG outside of hospital. Early recognition of the complication allows for preservative treatment and maintenance of a fully functional nutrition access. In the case of extensive and deep migration and the site being fully covered with mucosa, PEG removal and insertion of a new one is often necessary. In some cases, it is possible to use the existing, mature PEG canal with well-defined edges; however, in the case of severe infection a new PEG tube is inserted at another site...|$|E
40|$|Epidural {{anesthesia}} is an <b>invasive</b> <b>medical</b> <b>procedure</b> {{for pain}} relief. However, current teaching methods {{are not sufficient}} for acquiring proper aseptic technique in this procedure (Friedman et al., 2008). In the present study we examined whether a context-providing method, previously successfully used for training Boeing pilots (Taatgen, Huss & Anderson, 2008), might be superior to the current practice of teaching the steps in the procedure as a list of actions. We taught 37 undergraduate medical students the preparation and execution of {{the first part of}} the epidural anesthesia procedure with either List instructions or Context instructions. In the List condition, the order of the actions had to be remembered and executed in that particular order. In the Context condition, participants were given instructions with photographs that showed the pre-conditions of a set of actions (“before”) and the post-condition (“after”), together with a description of the actions to be performed within the set. Thus, the List approach relies heavily on memory, whereas in the Context method at least part of action control should be delegated to the environment to prime the appropriate actions. However, contrary to expectations, participants in the Context condition performed worse than participants receiving the more traditional List instruction: they made significantly more sterility errors. We conclude that a better instruction method to learn a procedure does not necessarily lead to better aseptic technique and suggest that the concept of sterility be taught separately as well...|$|E
40|$|Preparatory {{information}} {{does not}} always reduce anxiety in patients scheduled for a stressful medical procedure. This study assessed the effects of information-based interventions presented intra-procedurally and monitoring coping style on distress and anxiety in patients undergoing an invasive diagnostic procedure to examine pre-cancerous cervical lesions. One hundred and fifty five first-time colposcopy patients {{were randomly assigned to}} an information-avoidant (relaxation or cognitive distraction), information-high (video colposcopy), or a control condition. Main outcome measures included state anxiety, mood, physiological and observational measures of distress. Psychophysiological measures of anxiety significantly reduced over time, with the highest measures of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) and heart rate obtained at baseline. A mixed analysis of variance demonstrated a significant time × information condition × monitoring status interaction on SBP, F(6, 294) = 4. 01, p =. 001. During colposcopy, low monitors exhibited significantly lower SBP than high monitors in the control condition, and high monitors displayed significantly lower SBP in the relaxation condition and the video colposcopy condition than in the control condition. There were no significant interactions between coping style and level of information on self-report measures of distress, although state anxiety and negative affect was significantly reduced following colposcopy. The results confirm that matching preferred coping style to level of information reduces physiological arousal associated with an <b>invasive</b> <b>medical</b> <b>procedure,</b> but mainly for patients with high monitoring coping style. Low monitors may have greater coping flexibility than high monitors, and may be able to utilise a variety of coping strategies...|$|E
