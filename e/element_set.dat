25|$|Notice {{that the}} four ordered pairs (2-tuples) formed by the rows {{restricted}} to {{the first and third}} columns, namely (1,1), (2,1), (1,2) and (2,2) are all the possible ordered pairs of the two <b>element</b> <b>set</b> and each appears exactly once. The second and third columns would give, (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) and (1,2); again, all possible ordered pairs each appearing once. The same statement would hold had the first and second columns been used. This is thus an orthogonal array of strength two.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{the notion}} of {{permutation}} relates to the act of arranging {{all the members of}} a set into some sequence or order, or if the set is already ordered, rearranging (reordering) its elements, a process called permuting. These differ from combinations, which are selections of some members of a set where order is disregarded. For example, written as tuples, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). These are all the possible orderings of this three <b>element</b> <b>set.</b> As another example, an anagram of a word, all of whose letters are different, is a permutation of its letters. In this example, the letters are already ordered in the original word and the anagram is a reordering of the letters. The study of permutations of finite sets is a topic in the field of combinatorics.|$|E

Both the publicly available <b>element</b> <b>sets</b> issued by the North American Aerospace Defense Command and <b>element</b> <b>sets</b> estimated from GPS tracking data are assessed. The nanosatellite, which carries an intermittently operated dual-frequency GPS receiver, presents {{one of the first}} opportunities to assess two-line-element accuracy for an object measuring only 10 × 10 × 35 [*][*]cm using precise reference orbits. The larger satellites provide continuous GPS coverage as well as insight into the impact of maneuvers and formation flying on two-line <b>element</b> <b>sets.</b> It is found that, overall, the North American Aerospace Defense Command two-line <b>element</b> <b>sets</b> provide reliable position information accurate to a few kilometers for small satellites in low Earth orbit and that, with an arc length similar to the North American Aerospace Defense Command, two-line elements estimated from continuous GPS data or even intermittent GPS data collected sufficiently often can improve the spread of five-day along-track propagation errors from 10 km down to 2 km for a nanosatellite.

2500|$|If M is a matroid with <b>element</b> <b>set</b> E, and S is {{a subset}} of E, the {{restriction}} of M to S, written M|S, is the matroid on the set S whose independent sets are the independent sets of M that are contained in S.

In linear algebra, this corresponds to restricting to the subspace generated by the vectors in S. [...] Equivalently if T = M−S this may be termed the deletion of T, written M\T or M−T.

[...] In 1867 radical [...] (1814–1880), a white preacher, editor and Scalawag (white Southerners supporting Reconstruction) mobilized the black Republican vote by calling for the confiscation of all plantations and turning the land over to Freedmen and poor whites. The [...] "True Republicans" [...] (the moderates), led by former Whigs, businessmen and planters, while supportive of black suffrage, drew the line at property confiscation. A compromise was reached calling for confiscation if the planters tried to intimidate black voters. Hunnicutt's coalition took control of the Republican Party, and began to demand the permanent disfranchisement of all whites who had supported the Confederacy. The Virginia Republican party became permanently split, and many moderate Republicans switched to the opposition [...] "Conservatives".

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a method for {{dynamically}} assembling views in multi-dimensional data cubes in order to more e#ciently support data analysis and querying involving aggregations. The proposed method decomposes the data cubes into an indexed hierarchy of view elements. The view elements di#er from traditional data cube cells in that they correspond to partial and residual aggregations of the data cube. The view elements provide highly granular building blocks for synthesizing the aggregated and rangeaggregated views of the data cubes. We propose a strategy for selecting and materializing the view elements based on the frequency of view access. This allows the dynamic adaptation of the view <b>element</b> <b>sets</b> to patterns of retrieval. We present a fast and optimal algorithm for selecting non-expansive view <b>element</b> <b>sets</b> that minimize the processing costs for generating a population of aggregated views.
