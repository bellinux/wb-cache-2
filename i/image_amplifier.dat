25|$|Fluoroscopy {{produces}} real-time {{images of}} internal {{structures of the}} body in a similar fashion to radiography, but employs a constant input of x-rays, at a lower dose rate. Contrast media, such as barium, iodine, and air are used to visualize internal organs as they work. Fluoroscopy is also used in image-guided procedures when constant feedback during a procedure is required. An image receptor is required to convert the radiation into an image after it has passed through the area of interest. Early on this was a fluorescing screen, which gave way to an <b>Image</b> <b>Amplifier</b> (IA) which was a large vacuum tube that had the receiving end coated with cesium iodide, and a mirror at the opposite end.

40|$|Three fiber based optical devices: all {{phosphate}} glass fiber laser, single hybrid mode fiber laser, and fiber <b>image</b> <b>amplifier,</b> were investigated in this dissertation. Phosphate fiber Bragg grating (FBG) is desired {{to improve performance}} of recently developed high power single frequency lasers that were based on highly rare earth ion doped phosphate fibers because these lasers were fabricated with silica FBGs that have incompatible properties with standard {{phosphate glass}}es. Since standard phosphate glasses are not photosensitive, Ge-doped phosphate glasses were fabricated and their UV-photosensitivity was examined. A phosphate fiber that has Ge-doped core showed UV index changes more than ~ 1. 1 × 10 ⁻³. An all-phosphate fiber laser was also demonstrated with the Ge-doped phosphate FBG. Single hybrid mode fiber laser that involves a large area mode in cavity formation was demonstrated. The fiber laser consists of an Er-doped active fiber and two FBGs. One FBG was a core-cladding mode converter, and the other FBG was a narrowband high reflector that selects the lasing wavelength and mode. This approach for designing a laser cavity provides a much larger mode area than conventional large-mode-area stepindex fibers, and is supposed to suitable for a high power fiber laser. Also this configuration allows us to make novel ring-like cavities and sensor devices that consist of higher mode of optical fibers. <b>Image</b> <b>amplifier</b> based on a highly rare earth ion doped phosphate fiber is a unique approach to overcome weakness of widely used image intensifiers that {{lose a lot of}} information in the image, such as spectral distribution, polarization, and phase. Image amplification with a 19 -pixel optical <b>image</b> <b>amplifier</b> array based on high gain per unit length Yb³⁺-doped phosphate glass optical fiber was demonstrated.

40|$|Purpose: To set {{local dose}} {{reference}} levels (DRL) that allow radiologists to control stochastic and deterministic effects. Methods and materials: Dose indicators for cerebral angiographies and hepatic embolizations were collected during 4 months and analyzed in our hospital. The data were compared when an <b>image</b> <b>amplifier</b> was {{used instead of}} a flat panel detector. The Mann and Whitney test was used. Results: For the 40 cerebral angiographies performed the DRL for DAP, fluoroscopy time and number of images were respectively: 166 Gy. cm 2, 19 min, 600. The maximum DAP was 490 Gy. cm 2 (fluoroscopy time: 84 min). No significant difference for fluoroscopy time and DAP for <b>image</b> <b>amplifier</b> and flat panel detector (p = 0. 88) was observed. The number of images was larger for flat panel detector (p = 0. 004). The values obtained were slightly over the present proposed DRL: 150 Gy. cm 2, 15 min, 400. Concerning the 13 hepatic embolizations the DRL for DAP fluoroscopy time and number of images were: 315 Gy. cm 2, 25 min, 370. The maximum DAP delivered was 845 Gy. cm 2 (fluoroscopy time of 48 min). No significant difference between <b>image</b> <b>amplifier</b> and flat panel detector was observed (p = 0. 005). The values obtained were also slightly over the present proposed DRL: 300 Gy. cm 2, 20 min, 200. Conclusion: These {{results show that the}} introduction of flat panel detector did not lead to an increase in patient dose. A DRL concerning the cumulative dose (that allow to control the deterministic effect) should be introduced to allow radiologists to have full control on the risks associated with ionizing radiations.

40|$|Abstract More than 100 {{years have}} passed since {{physicist}} W. C. Röntgen discovered X rays and their use in medicine. Knowledge about their harmful effects led to gradual im-plementing of protection rules. Attention of experts gradually focused on persons exa-mined or treated by ionizing radiation, as so-called medical exposition represents {{the most important part of}} person´s irradiation from artificial sources of radiation at all. De-finition of medical irradiation was accepted by Act No. 18 / 1997 Coll. (Atomic Act) and extended in novel of the Act (No. 13 / 2002 Coll.). Medical irradiation is not limited but two principles of radiation protection govern [...] principle of reasoning and principle of optimalization. I focused my attention on radiation load of patients during selective coronaro-graphy which still remains gold diagnostic standard for coronary arteries examination. I measured and evaluated the radiation dose of patients at two angiography machines in Teaching Hospital in Motol. They are angiography machines PHILIPS Integris Allura (made in 2002) at Institution of Imaging Methods and PHILIPS Integris HM 3000 (ma-de in 1993) at Cardiovascular Centre for Adults. Some technical parameters of these machines differ, e. g. the size of <b>image</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Since 2003 to 2007 10, 087 patients at Cardiovascular Centre for Adults and 7, 760 patients at Institution of Imaging Methods were examined by selective coronarography. I analyse all equipment of angiography work place, including technical of X-ray angiomachine, radiological standards, protection against radiation, requirements for imaging system, parameters impacting the quality of X-ray image, possibilities of lowering radiation load in patients. Hypothesis is based on idea that radiation load can be lowered by setting suita-ble exposition parameters and collimators. Methodology consists of measurements of exposition dose in 100 patients at Institution of Imaging Methods and at Cardivascular Centre. I compare the dose at both work places on the base of different size of <b>image</b> <b>amplifier,</b> different frequency of scanning and advert to different dose in different projection.

Evaluated data can serve for creating of radiologic standards which will contribute to staff education how to ma-nipulate sources of X-ray radiation to make the dose for a patient and for staff as low as possible...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Digital {{techniques}} in radiology have many advantages for radiologists, radiographers, patients, clinicians and hospital-operators from many perspectives: diagnostic quality, dose reduction, access to {{old and new}} images and reports via PACS, HIS and RIS. "nRadiologists concentrate {{more and more on}} organs and pathology (super) specialties rather than in modalities. Organ based radiology requires the integration of all modalities and has to cover large geographical regions to deliver expertise, as there few top-experts. This is only possible in the digital world of HICT (Health Information and Communication Technology), where digital detectors are {{the first step in a}} long chain of informatics. "nToday most of the diagnostic imaging modalities (CT, MRI, US, PET, [...] ) used in radiology are digital except plain film imaging. In order to digitize plain x-ray (also called General Radiology) there is choice between Computed Radiography (CR) based upon storage phosphor screens and DR (Digital Radiography) based on &quot;flat or panel&quot; detectors. A large spectrum of applications and price ranges is available on the market. "nTechnology: Both CR and DR rely on conversion and storage of x-ray energy in &quot;pixel&quot;-like elements in the detector. These detectors are linear (film is S-curved) and have a enormous dynamic range (1 in 100. 000) so no information is lost and they resist over- and under-exposure up to 4 times. "n- In CR x-ray energy is stored into the phosphor-crystals and converted into visible light after stimulation by (laser) light which is in turn captured and digitized by an optical system. Pixels (in size between 50 and 150 &micro;m) are one after one stimulated and translated into a digital image of millions of points. "n- In DR systems x-ray energy is converted in 2 or 3 steps into electrical charge that is stored in every pixel of the detector. These charges are digitized row after row to make a digital image. The conversion of the x-rays is done by a &quot;scintillator&quot; or phosphor, known from screens and <b>image</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> There are 2 groups of DR: the first group is amorphous selenium + TFT pixel backplane and the second is a scintillator + TFT pixel backplane. The first directly converts x-ray into charge (2 steps) and the latter first converts x-rays into light and light into charge in a photodiode in each pixel. "nOf course the DR technology is complex and difficult to manufacture in the large formats needed in radiology (14 &quot;x 17 &quot;) and explains the high price/unit (&gt; 200 k$). "nDR can only be justified in a limited number of situations: high throughput (like chest), high labor-cost and lack of radiographers, radiation-dose regulations. "nThe technical nature of DR is very sensitive to environmental conditions like vibrations (mobile applications) and temperature (Selenium has to be air-conditioned) and the portable models are still bulky and costly to put under the bed patients. However, in the future DR prices are expected to come down"n- There are numerous combined systems: lens or fiber coupled CCD systems guiding the x-ray image into a small (and cheap) CCD with a bad image quality. "nSlit/slot methods moving a small bundle of x-rays and a line-detector over the patient during several seconds exhausting the tube and the patient [...] "nThere is no perfect system: most have some advantages and some drawbacks and all of them are compromises between quality and price. "nConclusion: Today CR based on powder phosphors is still the best solution in a starter situation where cost and a broad range of ap-plications are important, because it replaces all types of film-screen cassettes by 1 CR cassette, without changes to the x-ray modality and the workflow. Immediately it allows lower doses and a decrease in repeat rates to &lt; 1 % at a high image quality (with multi-frequency image processing like Agfa Musica). "nCR readers are offered in a wide range of sophistication and prices matching most of the needs and budgets of radiology practices. "nFor special cases like pediatrics and mammography, low-dose high resolution Needle phosphor CR technology can compete with DR at a lower price. "nCR technology has proven to be cost-efficient on itself in radiology, DR has not yet. Although digital detectors improve the diagnostic quality along with the improved image quality, the real value of digital images is in the hospital-wide (and even further) availability of digital information at the level of PACS, RIS and HIS...|$|R
