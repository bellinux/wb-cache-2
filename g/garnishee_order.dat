40|$|The goal of {{the study}} was to explore the effect of <b>garnishee</b> <b>orders</b> on the {{personnel}} of the Department of Health, Rustenburg. The researcher utilised a qualitative research approach to gain deeper understanding of the effects of <b>garnishee</b> <b>orders</b> on the employees. The study used a non-probability sampling technique with volunteer sampling to select the sample of ten participants. Semi-structured interviews conducted with the use of an interview schedule in conjunction with a recording device were used to gather data. A qualitative analysis was used to grasp the richness of themes derived from the narrative of participants. In analysing data the researcher was guided by the analytical spiral of Creswell (1968) as stipulated by De Vos (2005 : 334) which involves planning and recording of data, data collection and preliminary analyses, managing and organising data, reading and writing memos, generating categories, themes and patterns, coding the data, testing the emergent understanding, searching for alternative explanations and representing and visualising. The empirical findings reveal that employees and management were confronted by the phenomenon of <b>garnishee</b> <b>orders</b> on a daily basis. The majority of participants view external factors to be the cause of their financial difficulties. The participants further revealed that they feel trapped by over-indebtedness resulting in psycho-social and occupational maladjustments. Ironically, some of the participants reported positive effects of <b>garnishee</b> <b>orders.</b> Furthermore, the study revealed that the participants felt that they would benefit from regular guidance and training with regard to personal financial management.

40|$|Taxation {{statues of}} most jurisdictions contain {{provisions}} {{that deal with}} defaulting taxpayers. The taxation statutes of Zimbabwe and South Africa have employed the concept of <b>garnishee</b> <b>orders</b> {{as a method of}} recovering tax. This method is codified in the respective taxation statutes under the guise of “third party appointments”, or simply “appointment of an agent”. This method is very convenient and expeditious for the tax collection authorities, namely, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) and the South Africa Revenue Service (SARS). Other jurisdictions have also employed this method, with varying degrees of invasiveness into the taxpayers’ constitutional rights. The concept of <b>garnishee</b> <b>orders</b> can have negative constitutional implications for the taxpayers in both Zimbabwe and South Africa. In Zimbabwe, compared to South Africa, the tax collection field is not as developed in terms of jurisprudence and the legislation. There are lessons that Zimbabwe could learn from South Africa, considering that the latter has experienced more than two decades of constitutional democracy. Therefore, in order to identify areas for development, the two jurisdictions are critically reviewed, with particular attention to the legislative provisions and case law dealing with <b>garnishee</b> <b>orders</b> in the tax collection context. Approaches employed by other countries in relation to similar concepts and provisions are also analysed. The lessons learned from this analysis could suggest a less invasive method of recovering tax from defaulting taxpayers and an approach to be followed by the tax authorities, ZIMRA and SARS {{that would allow them to}} fulfil their responsibilities and mandate with taxpayer-friendly measures...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} the St. Luke's Day Oration, {{delivered}} by His Honour the Chief Justice to the Malta Branch of the British Medical Association on the 18 th October 1973 at the Medical School of the University. Civil {{cases in which}} doctors had been involved and which figure out in Maltese Law Reports are described. A case in point shows how a father, sued a doctor for damages arising out {{of the fact that}} the son, who was under the professional care of the doctor, allegedly through the doctor's negligence, lost his foot and suffered permanent debilitation. Warrants of seizure and of impediment of departure, as well as a <b>garnishee</b> <b>order,</b> were also issued against the doctor. It was on the basis of the experts' findings themselves that both Courts reached the clear conclusion that there had been negligence on the part of the doctor. Several other cases are reported, one of which for instance involves the doctor`s prescription. The focus here is on the dark side of things that brings out more fully the brighter side, whereby the medical profession in Malta has indeed a very bright record. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|MBA - WBSThe banking {{industry}} {{is prone to}} fraud committed by employees. According to South African banking trade union, SASBO, employee fraud includes misap-propriating deposits; colluding with external criminals; misusing own bank ac-counts; making fictitious deposits; granting unauthorised credit facilities to family; and falsifying bank records (SASBO News “Catch those crooks”, 2001) The purpose of this project report is to provide insights to the researcher’s employer, a South African Retail bank, to enable the bank to develop strate-gies to combat fraud committed by employees. Qualitative research was used to identify the broad factors contributing to employee fraud. Thereafter, quan-titative {{analysis was used to}} test the relationships between available demo-graphic data.

40|$|Financial {{problems}} {{have become a}} serious problem that enjoys high priority within the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) in the Office of the Premier, Limpopo Province. It {{is a major concern}} shared by management and staff, as it continuously impact negatively on job performance due to absenteeism and the low morale of employees. The researcher became motivated to undertake this research study due to her practical and professional experience as an EAP Practitioner within the Office of the Premier. It has been observed and established by the researcher during her professional working career that financial problems are {{at the top of the}} list in terms of statistics of cases handled within the EAP Office. Furthermore, no prior study was done that could determine the nature of the problem. This situation therefore triggered the researcher to conduct a study that will determine the nature of the problem. The aim of this study is to explore the nature and effects of financial problems on employees in the Office of the Premier, Limpopo Province. In conducting this study, the researcher followed a qualitative research approach in order to elicit the views and opinions of the respondents regarding the nature and effects of financial problems. The semi structured one-to-one interview schedule was used in order to gather the data. A total of nine (9) respondents, obtained from the database of statistical records in the EAP Office, were interviewed. A purposive sampling method was used to select the sample of nine respondents from a population of eighteen (18). The researcher selected those respondents with two or more <b>garnishee</b> <b>orders</b> or loans. A theoretical discussion focusing on: the nature of financial problems as a common phenomenon, the causes of financial problems, the symptoms of financial problems, the effects of financial problems on employees, as well as guidelines on how to assist troubled employees will be presented in Chapter two. The research findings indicated that there seems to be a positive relationship between financial planning and financial problems. Few respondents believed that financial problems could result from poor financial planning. The findings further revealed that other social factors such as: overwhelming parental responsibilities of raising offsprings, loss of income by a spouse, high financial demands placed upon single parents and the rapid increase of inflation contribute towards financial difficulties. The effects of financial problems can be devastating since it impacts negatively on employees’ psychological and physical well-being. Thus, job performance suffers.

40|$|Financial {{management}} as a programme generally {{refers to a}} set of behaviours in the areas of cash management, credit management, financial planning, investments, insurance and retirement and estate planning (Dowling, Corney & Hoiles, 2009 : 5). BancVue (2010) adds by describing a personal financial management programme as a tool that helps consumers to track and manage their finances, create budgets, categorise and anticipate spending, and analyse the distribution and performance of their investments. It involves the efficient use of personal finance to meet the individual s motives and goals. Survival in this century depends on having resources to sustain one self. The greatest resource nowadays is having income to meet the basic needs and other personal needs as indicated by Maslow s hierarchy of needs (Moaisi, 2013 : 21). The income earned by an individual, just like any other resource, needs good management to ensure that the best value can be extracted and utilised efficiently and effectively (Muske & Winter, 2004). It is for these reasons that all consumers should have basic knowledge and skills in terms of personal financial management that would enable sufficient control of finances, resulting in meeting their basic needs and other necessities (Moaisi, 2013 : 21 - 22). The researcher is of the opinion that in order to educate consumers government and the private sector should start by strengthening financial literacy programmes for all, especially the younger generation. If people are more financially literate, they will understand credit and debt management better. It is a well-known {{fact that there is a}} high prevalence of indebtedness among public servants in the public sector (Public Commission Report, 2007). A report released by the University of Pretoria, Law Clinic (Haupt et al., 2008 : 14) revealed that about R 235 million (23 %) which contributed to the garnishee debt of public servants was based in the national departments. This indicated that there was a substantial number of employees in national departments who were serving <b>garnishees</b> <b>orders.</b> This was confirmed by a report released by PERSAL in the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform in the Pietermaritzburg region which revealed that between March 2009 and January 2011, 15 % of employees were garnisheed as a result of defaulting contracts with different credit providers. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Personal Financial Management Programme for the financial well-being of employees in the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform in the Pietermaritzburg region within the KwaZulu- Natal province. A quantitative study has been conducted and the data was collected through a questionnaire from a sample of 15 employees in the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform in Kwa-Zulu Natal province in Pietermaritzburg region. Valuable conclusions and recommendations originated from the findings of this research study. In terms of the quantitative results it was clear that the Personal Financial Management Programme did not make a statistical significant impact on the respondents knowledge level and attitudes towards financial management. However, the qualitative comments made by respondents described the Personal Financial Management Programme as a good intervention and that it should be repeated and offered to a greater number of employees. The implications of the study could be that employees would gain financial skills to help them manage their finances better and therefore improve their work performance and reduce absenteeism as a result.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{purports to}} ascertain whether the Constitution of South Africa provides protection for taxpayers against specific practices and procedures utilised by SARS in order to collect taxes. The collection of taxes is imperative in ensuring that economical and socioeconomical objectives of the government are met. SARS is therefore awarded specific powers to achieve this. On the other side are taxpayers who are awarded constitutionally enshrined rights. Said rights may only be limited if the limitation is reasonable and just. Tension between SARS’ task and the taxpayers’ rights exist. This dissertation endeavours to find a balance where SARS can effectively collect tax whilst the taxpayers’ rights are not unreasonably and unjustly limited. The Constitution affords taxpayers the right to just administrative action. The right entails, amongst others, that when a dispute arises both parties sides must be heard. The right to just administrative action also includes legitimate expectations. A practice has transpired where SARS denies being bound by its own rulings and notes. A legitimate expectation is, nevertheless, created that SARS will act in accordance with its rulings and notes. The doctrine of legitimate expectations will provide assistance to the taxpayer in this situation. SARS further {{has the power to}} appoint a taxpayer’s agent. This procedure does not provide for the taxpayer to state his case before such an appointment is made. This prima facie violates a person’s right to just administrative action. When compared to the civil procedure of <b>garnishee</b> <b>orders</b> valuable differences transpired which will assist in elevating the tension between the taxpayer’s rights and SARS’ duty. A further right afforded, is the right of access to the court. The statement procedure and the “pay now, argue later” rule appear to be in conflict with said right. The statement procedure, which empowers SARS to file a statement at court to be made a judgment, exceeds the normal recourse available for ordinary litigants, namely the default judgment procedure. This procedure has, however, survived constitutional scrutiny. The “pay now, argue later” rule entails that a taxpayer must first pay the assessed amount before questioning the amount. This procedure is a departure from the general rule utilised in civil proceedings. It was held that this procedure is constitutional. This is, however, questioned {{due to the fact that}} at the time this rule is invoked the court’s jurisdiction is excluded. Furthermore, a taxpayer can rely on his right to property. If SARS unreasonably delays a refund due to the taxpayer this will violate said right. The situation relating to money owed in civil matters and the judgment of Sage Life Ltd indicates that a taxpayer will be entitled to interest and accordingly the violation will not be unreasonable or unjust. Moreover a taxpayer is afforded the right to privacy. Tension may arise when SARS obtains a warrant to search and seize the taxpayer’s property. This procedure is similar to the procedure of obtaining a warrant in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act. Declaring this procedure unconstitutional is implausible. Other countries faced with the tension between their revenue service collecting tax and their taxpayers’ rights, are utilising certain measures to reduce this tension. Amongst other a service charter, to provide legal certainty, instituting complaints forums, to deal with poor service, and providing brochures, to educate the taxpayers is identified. The predominant measure is, however, the office of the ombudsman. The Constitution, together with other measures, does provide adequate protection for a taxpayer against SARS. Accordingly, the tension between SARS’ duty and the taxpayers’ rights is balanced with the assistance of the Constitution. CopyrightDissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

40|$|In 2010, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of Swaziland {{noticed a}} {{significant}} increase in employee absenteeism which they discovered was related mainly to: poor health (sick leave), personal and financial stress (<b>garnishee</b> <b>orders</b> were increasing), and low staff morale, the consequence of which was low productivity and missed deadlines (FSRA, 2010 : 7). High levels of absenteeism meant that a sizeable number of employees were unable to complete their daily tasks (FSRA, 2010 : 7). Consequently, in 2011, the FSRA Human Resource Department started a wellness programme for all employees in the organization in an attempt to respond to the human resource challenges reported in 2009 / 10 financial year. By the end of 2012, FSRA management reported that the introduction of the EWP had not yielded the expected results. This therefore prompted management to request an evaluation of the FSRA employee wellness programme. The aim of this research was to identify and prioritize the needs of employees in terms of requirements of a wellness programme and how it should be delivered. The specific objectives of the study are as follows: to identify the wellness needs of employees, to identify employee preferences in terms of the type of interventions to be included in a wellness programme, to identify the preferred mode of delivery of the wellness programme and to make recommendations to management on the design of a wellness programme. Questionnaires with closed ended questions were used to collect data for this survey. The questionnaire used is attached as Appendix A. By means of a needs analysis survey, this research was designed to assess the FSRA employees’ needs in terms of an employee wellness programme, as well as the preferred EWP delivery methods. About 70 percent of FSRA employees participated in the survey. The respondents completed the questionnaire and submitted it online over a period of 10 working days (2 weeks). This report is structured into three sections, namely; section one, which is the evaluation report that gives details {{of the importance of the}} study, highlights research methods and then present the results, discussions and recommendations. Section two deals with the literature review while section three reports on the research methodology, research design and procedures and the limitation of the study. In light of the findings on the wellness needs of employees, 72 percent of the respondents felt the current wellness programme was very inadequate and a further 10 percent added that it was inadequate in addressing their wellness needs largely because the needs were not known. The most important wellness needs identified included: exercise, nutrition, personal hygiene, disease awareness and treatment of illness, coping with stress, coping with workload, ventilation, safety, bereavement, personal debt, and retirement planning. The most preferred wellness interventions that respondents proposed include Flexible Work Schedule, Safe Workplace, Improved Ventilation, Retirement Planning Advice and Gymnasium. Further analysis done using correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant positive relationship between the wellness needs and the wellness interventions. Concerning the delivery of the wellness programme, most of the employees indicated that outsourcing certain services was better than having them in house. The highest ranking of the services for out sourcing were nutrition education and medical checkups that ranked between 82 percent and 75 percent respectively. The respondents indicated that they want almost all the chosen interventions to be outsourced. Time slots should also be taken into consideration to ensure employee participation in the wellness programme services. The respondent FSRA employees seem to prefer interventions of an educational nature to be during the lunch hour. These include Nutrition Education, Health Education, Hygiene Education and Medical Check ups and Treatment, whereas Gymnasium was preferred to be after working hours...|$|R
40|$|Studies as {{described}} in the literature review indicate that most South Africans are highly in debt. The South African Reserve Bank’s quarterly bulletin is one of the prominent barometers for measuring household debt in the country and {{over the last five years}} has been indicating a steady decline but still very high household debt among South Africans. Studies have also shown that this relates to poor financial literacy and consumer ignorance in applying basic financial management practices. This is discussed in Chapter two of the study. The aim of the study was to determine the consumer debt level of the Department of Health public servants in Mahikeng, North West Province. This study used a consumer survey to measure consumer indebtedness among public servants in Mahikeng. The results of the study support literature in that the study found that most public servants are indebted. The findings also showed that 63 % of the public servants spent more than 20 % of their income in servicing debt. Thirteen per cent of the public servants taking part in the study had been served with either <b>garnishee</b> or emolument <b>orders.</b> The results of the study seem to suggest that public servants working for the Department of Health in Mahikeng and taking part in the study were indebted.
