5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

"I {{love the}} Braves, so when {{president}} John Schuerholz {{looked me in}} my face and told me 'I'd bet my house and my family that you won't be traded' that's <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> confidence <b>for</b> <b>me</b> coming from a General Manager, and then out of nowhere, one week later I'm gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|Aunt Sally jumped for her, {{and most}} hugged the head off of her, and cried over her, and I found a <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> place <b>for</b> <b>me</b> under the bed, {{for it was}} getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. And I peeped out, and {{in a little while}} Tom's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of {{grinding}} him into the earth, you know. And then she says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Spare no money," [...] I said to Roscoe. [...] "Let {{everything}} on the Snark be of the best. And never mind decoration. Plain pine boards is <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> finishing <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> But put the money into the construction. Let the Snark be as staunch and strong as any boat afloat. Never mind what it costs to make her staunch and strong; you see that she is made staunch and strong, and I'll go on writing and earning {{the money to pay}} for it." ...|$|R

6000|$|Dr. Heinrich Brugsch-Bey, whose [...] "History of Egypt"[EN#45] is {{the latest}} and best gift to Egyptologists, kindly drew my {{attention}} to an interesting passage in his work, and was <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> to copy <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{the source of his}} information, tile Harris Papyrus (No. 1) in the British Museum.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{part of the}} world? No, we've got nobody our way, that's <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> you. Let <b>me</b> see; Newcome has a da'ghter that's old enough, but she's desp'rate humbly (Anglice, homely--the {{people of}} New England reserve 'ugly' for moral qualities) and wouldn't suit, no how. I don't think the Littlepages would overmuch like being warp and fillin' with the Newcomes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why now, child, you've {{got a lot}} of notions. Besides what's {{the matter}} with the town? Looks good to me. I've had people that have {{traveled}} all over the world tell me time and again that Gopher Prairie is the prettiest place in the Middlewest. <b>Good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> anybody. Certainly <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Mama and <b>me.</b> Besides! Mama and me are planning to go out to Pasadena and buy a bungalow and live there." ...|$|R

6000|$|All the same, {{even when}} I'm at my very piousest, it puts me out if my {{drawings}} go wrong. I'm {{going to draw}} St. Ursula's blue slippers to-day, and if I can't do them nicely shall be in great despair. I've just found a little cunning inscription on her bedpost, 'IN FANNTIA.' The double N puzzled me at first, but Carpaccio spells anyhow. My head is not <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a bedpost....Oh <b>me,</b> the sweet Grange!--Thwaite, I mean (bedpost again); {{to think of it}} in this mass of weeds and ruin! ...|$|R
6000|$|What Selina {{had said}} {{of me and}} my mother's portrait, other friends had said. There was nothing that I know of to {{interest}} me in hearing it repeated--and yet it set me pondering on the want of resemblance between my mother's face and mine, and wondering (not for the first time) what sort of woman my mother was. When my father speaks of her, no words of praise that he can utter seem to be <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> her. Oh, <b>me,</b> I wish I was a little more like my mother! ...|$|R
5000|$|In Gouldman's words: Kevin and I {{have always}} {{stayed in touch}} even though we haven't {{actually}} worked together for many years, so I was delighted when he called to suggest we write some songs. When I asked [...] "Why?" [...] He said, [...] "No reason … just {{to do it and}} see what happens." [...] A <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> reason <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> What followed was a series of writing and recording sessions … Something like the early days when we wrote and recorded for ourselves with one ear half cocked for something that broke the mould.I always figured Mr. G had the best voice in the band, ironic then that he never sang lead on a 10cc single … Even I managed that. Now justice has been done. Kevin's voice and razor sharp lyrics take us to places we haven't visited before… Always a good place to start.|$|R

6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} the view I take of the matter, {{according}} to what your father has told me?" [...] Mr. Flack enquired. [...] "I don't mean it was {{he gave me the}} tip; I guess I've seen enough over here by this time to have worked it out. They're scandalised all right--they're blue with horror and have never heard of anything so dreadful. Miss Francie," [...] her visitor roared, [...] "that ain't <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> you and <b>me.</b> They know what's in the papers every day of their lives and they know how it got there. They ain't like the fellow in the story--who was he?--who couldn't think how the apples got into the dumplings. They're just grabbing a pretext to break because--because, well, they don't think you're blue blood. They're delighted to strike a pretext they can work, and they're all cackling over the egg it has taken so many hens of 'em to lay. That's MY diagnosis if you want to know." ...|$|R
60|$|And now appear, dim {{at first}} and distant, but {{brightening}} and nearing fast, many a right good fellow and many a right good horse. I know {{three out of four}} of them, their private histories, the private histories of their horses: and could tell you many a good story of them: but shall not, being an English gentleman, and not an American litterateur. They may not all be very clever, or very learned, or very anything except gallant men; but they are all <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> company <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> or anyone; and each has his own specialite, for which I like him. That huntsman I have known for fifteen years, and sat many an hour beside his father's death-bed. I am godfather to that whip's child. I have seen the servants of the hunt, as I have the hounds, grow up round <b>me</b> <b>for</b> two generations, and I feel for them as old friends; and like to look into their brave, honest, weather- beaten faces. That red coat there, I knew him when he was a schoolboy; and now he is a captain in the Guards, and won his Victoria Cross at Inkermann: that bright green coat is the best farmer, as well as the hardest rider, for many a mile round; one who plays, as he works, with all his might, and might have been a beau sabreur and colonel of dragoons. So might that black coat, who now brews good beer, and stands up for the poor at the Board of Guardians, and rides, like the green coat, as well as he works. That other black coat is a county banker; but he knows more of the fox than the fox knows of himself, and where the hounds are, there will he be this day. That red coat has hunted kangaroo in Australia: that one, as clever and good as he is brave and simple, has stood by Napier's side in many an Indian fight: that one won his Victoria at Delhi, and was cut up at Lucknow, with more than twenty wounds: that one has--but what matter to you who each man is? Enough that each can tell one a good story, welcome one cheerfully, and give one out here, in the wild forest, the wholesome feeling of being at home among friends.|$|R
