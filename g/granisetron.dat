25|$|The first-generation 5-HT3 {{receptor}} antagonist (ondansetron, dolasetron, <b>granisetron,</b> and tropisetron) {{have been}} the most important drugs in antiemetic therapy for emetogenic chemotherapy. They are especially effective in treating acute emesis, occurring in the first 24 hours following chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} including <b>granisetron</b> {{appear to be}} effective in controlling post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It is unclear if it is more or less effective than other agents such as droperidol, metoclopramide, ondansetron or cyclizine.|$|E
25|$|Some 5-HT3 antagonists, such as ondansetron, <b>granisetron,</b> and tropisetron, are {{important}} antiemetic agents. They {{are particularly important}} in treating the nausea and vomiting that occur during anticancer chemotherapy using cytotoxic drugs. Another application is {{in the treatment of}} postoperative nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|When {{combined}} with carbidopa (as {{a treatment for}} symptoms of Parkinson's disease), 5-HTP causes nausea and vomiting; however this can be alleviated via administration of <b>granisetron.</b> As mentioned below under pharmacology, cases of scleroderma-like illness {{have been reported in}} patients using carbidopa and 5-HTP.|$|E
25|$|A <b>granisetron</b> {{transdermal patch}} with the trade name Sancuso was {{approved}} by the US FDA on September 12, 2008. Sancuso is manufactured by 3M Drug Delivery Systems Division in St. Paul, MN, for ProStrakan, Inc., a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Bedminster, NJ, with global headquarters in Scotland.|$|E
25|$|Nausea and vomiting: {{cisplatin}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} emetogenic chemotherapy agents, but this symptom is managed with prophylactic antiemetics (ondansetron, <b>granisetron,</b> etc.) in combination with corticosteroids. Aprepitant combined with ondansetron and dexamethasone has been shown to be better for highly emetogenic chemotherapy than just ondansetron and dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Granisetron</b> was {{developed}} by chemists working at the British drug company Beecham around 1988 and is available as a generic. It is produced by Roche Laboratories under the trade name Kytril. The drug was approved in the United Kingdom in 1991 and in United States in 1994 by the FDA.|$|E
25|$|<b>Granisetron</b> was {{developed}} around 1988. It {{is available in}} the U.S., UK, Australia and other countries. Clinical trials suggest that it is more effective than other 5-HT3 antagonists in preventing delayed CINV (nausea and vomiting that occur more than 24 hours after the first dose of chemotherapy). It is taken once daily.|$|E
25|$|An {{extended}} release injectable {{version of}} <b>granisetron,</b> known as Sustol {{is also available}} in the United States as of 2016. The long acting form {{is used for the}} treatment of both acute and delayed CINV in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and anthrocycline and/or cyclophosphamide (AC) highly emetogenic regimens. In its review, the FDA did not grant the broad HEC label to the drug citing the focus on AC regimens, primarily breast-cancer, and lack of data.|$|E
25|$|Ondansetron was {{the first}} 5-HT3 antagonist, {{developed}} by Glaxo around 1984. Its efficacy was first established in 1987, in animal models, and it was extensively studied over the following years. Ondansetron {{was approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1991, and has since become available in several other countries, including the UK, Ireland, Australia, Canada, France and Brazil. As of 2008, ondansetron and <b>granisetron</b> are the only 5-HT3 antagonists available as a generic drug in the United States. Ondansetron may be given several times daily, depending on the severity of symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pharmacophore}} of 5-HT3receptors {{consists of}} three components: a carbonyl-containing linking moiety, [...] aromatic/heteroaromatic ring, and a basic center. [...] The carbonyl group is coplanar to the aromatic ring. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists {{are more likely to}} bind in their protonated form. Docking of a range of antagonists into a homology model of the 5-HT3 receptor binding site shows a reasonably good agreement with the pharmacophore model and supports the observed differences between species. Studies of <b>granisetron</b> in the binding pocket revealed that the aromatic rings of <b>granisetron</b> lie between W183 and Y234 and the azabiciclic ring [...] between W90 and F226. In this study another energetically favorable location of <b>granisetron</b> was identified, closer to the membrane, on a position that could {{be a part of a}} binding/unbinding pathway for the ligand. A similarly located alternative binding site for <b>granisetron</b> has since been identified in another study of the 5-HT3 receptor.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Granisetron</b> is metabolized slowly by the liver, {{giving it}} a longer than average half-life. One dose usually lasts 4 to 9 hours and is usually {{administered}} once or twice daily. [...] This drug {{is removed from the}} body by the liver and kidneys.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists {{was a dramatic}} improvement {{in the treatment of}} nausea and vomiting. [...] Ondansetron, <b>granisetron,</b> dolasetron and palonosetron are currently approved in the United States, and form the cornerstone of therapy for the control of acute emesis with chemotherapy agents with moderate to high emetogenic potential.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Granisetron</b> is a well-tolerated drug {{with few}} side effects. Headache, dizziness, and {{constipation}} {{are the most}} commonly reported side effects associated with its use. [...] There have been no significant drug interactions reported with this drug's use. [...] It is broken down by the liver's cytochrome P450 system and it has {{little effect on the}} metabolism of other drugs broken down by this system.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Granisetron</b> is a {{serotonin}} 5-HT3 receptor antagonist {{used as an}} antiemetic {{to treat}} nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy. Its main effect {{is to reduce the}} activity of the vagus nerve, which is a nerve that activates the vomiting center in the medulla oblongata. [...] It does not have much effect on vomiting due to motion sickness. [...] This drug does not have any effect on dopamine receptors or muscarinic receptors.|$|E
2500|$|While Fozard was {{investigating}} cocaine analogues, researchers at Sandoz identified the potent, selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ICS 205-930 {{from which the}} first marketed selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists ondansetron and <b>granisetron</b> were developed, and approved in 1991 and 1993 respectively. [...] Several compounds related to MDL 72222 were synthesized which eventually resulted in approval of tropisetron in 1994 and dolasetron in 1997. A new and improved 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, named palonosetron, was approved in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Experiments {{have shown}} {{evidence}} that the ligand-binding site {{is located at the}} interface of two adjacent subunits. The ligand binding site is formed by three loops (A-C) from the principal ligand binding subunit (principal face) and three β-strands (D-F) from the adjacent subunit (complementary face). The amino acid residue E129 on loop A faces into the binding pocket and forms a critical hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of 5-HT. [...] Loop B contains W183, a critical tryptophan ligand binding residue that contributes to a cation-π interaction between the pi electron density of tryptophan and the primary amine of 5-HT. [...] Loop C residues have been considered as candidates for the differing pharmacology of rodent and human 5-HT3 receptors because of their divergence between species. [...] The most important aromatic residue within loop C is probably Y234 that lies opposite to the loop B tryptophan in the ligand binding pocket and is involved in ligand binding. [...] Loops D and F are in fact β-strands not loops. [...] W90 in loop D is critical for ligand binding and antagonists may directly contact R92. The azabicyclic ring of the competitive antagonist <b>granisetron</b> is located close to W183 forming a cation-pi interaction. [...] Loop E residues Y143, G148, E149, V150, Q151, N152, Y153 and K154 may be important for <b>granisetron</b> binding. [...] The structure of loop F has yet to be clarified but W195 and D204 seem to be critical for ligand binding.|$|E
