5|$|More than 930,000policyholders in South Florida lost {{coverage}} after 11insurance companies went bankrupt, {{caused by}} more than 600,000insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, {{in an effort to}} restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to <b>felt</b> <b>paper,</b> which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or shingles were peeled off, the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses.|$|E
25|$|Polishing wheels {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of types to fulfil a wide range of needs. The most common {{materials}} used for polishing wheels are wood, leather, canvas, cotton cloth, plastic, <b>felt,</b> <b>paper,</b> sheepskin, impregnated rubber, canvas composition, and wool; leather and canvas are the most common. Wooden wheels have emery or other abrasives glued onto them and are used to polish flat surfaces and maintained good edges. There are many types of cloth wheels. Cloth wheels that are cemented together are very hard and used for rough work, whereas other cloth wheels that are sewn and glued together are not as aggressive. There are cloth wheels that are not glued or cemented, instead these are sewed and have metal side plates for support. Solid felt wheels are popular for fine finishes. Hard roughing wheels can be made by cementing together strawboard paper disks. Softer paper wheels are made from <b>felt</b> <b>paper.</b> Most wheels are run at approximately 7500 surface feet per minute (SFM), however muslin, felt and leather wheels are usually run at 4000 SFM.|$|E

The inside was clad in brown hardboard, with aluminum plats under the windows. The floor was a welded section of steel U-profiles, with a wooden floor covered with <b>felt</b> <b>paper</b> and linoleum. There were soon replaced with rubber flooring. The front of the vehicle had a steel plate which the controller to which the controller was fastened. This area doubled as a collision zone.|$|E

50|$|The main {{environmental}} concern in recycling asphalt shingles is the rare presence of asbestos in shingles manufactured before 1980. Asbestos {{was also used}} in some <b>felt</b> <b>paper,</b> roll roofing, roof paint, roof coating, caulking, and mastic.|$|E
50|$|Building {{papers and}} {{membranes}} {{are used for}} many reasons in construction. One of the oldest building papers is red rosin paper which {{was known to be}} in use before 1850 and was used as an underlayment in exterior walls, roofs, and floors and for protecting a jobsite during construction. Tar paper was invented late in the 19th century and was used for similar purposes as rosin paper and for gravel roofs. Tar paper has largely fallen out of use supplanted by asphalt <b>felt</b> <b>paper.</b> <b>Felt</b> <b>paper</b> has been supplanted in some uses by synthetic underlayments, particularly in roofing by synthetic underlayments and siding by housewraps.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally most flat roofs in {{the western}} world make use of tar or asphalt more usually <b>felt</b> <b>paper</b> applied over roof decking to keep a {{building}} watertight. The <b>felt</b> <b>paper</b> is in turn covered with a flood coat of bitumen (asphalt or tar) and then gravel to keep the sun's heat, UV rays and weather off it and helps protect it from cracking or blistering and degradation. Roof decking is usually of plywood, chipboard or OSB boards (OSB = Oriented Strand Board, also known as Sterling board) of around 18mm thickness, steel or concrete. The mopping of bitumen is applied in two or more coats (usually 3 or 4) as a hot liquid, heated in a kettle. A flooded coat of bitumen is applied over the felts and gravel is embedded in the hot bitumen.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{plasterboard}} {{plant in}} the UK was opened in 1888 in Rochester, Kent. Sackett Board was invented in 1894 by Augustine Sackett and Fred Kane, graduates of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. It was made by layering plaster within four plies of wool <b>felt</b> <b>paper.</b> Sheets were 36" [...] × 36" [...] × 1/4" [...] thick with open (untaped) edges.|$|E
50|$|Another basic {{designation}} is organic or inorganic. Organic <b>felt</b> <b>paper</b> has a {{base material}} made with formerly living {{materials such as}} rag fibre, hessian (burlap), or cellulose fibres (wood, or jute). Organic felt papers are now considered obsolete, only comprising {{five percent of the}} market in 1987. Inorganic base products are polyester, glass fibre developed in the 1950s, and historically, asbestos mat. Polyester mat is weaker and less chemically stable than fibreglass but because it is cheap is gaining market share. Polyester mat is primarily used with the more flexible modified-bitumen felt products. Asbestos mat was the first inorganic base material but was outlawed in the 1980s for health reasons but is still in use on some buildings. Inorganic felts are lighter, more tear-resistant, more fire-resistant, and do not absorb water. Another type of <b>felt</b> <b>paper</b> is perforated for use in built-up roofing and is not for use as a water-resistant underlay.|$|E
50|$|Blasting mats {{are often}} used in {{combination}} with blasting blankets as an additional layer over the mats. The blankets are larger than the mats designed to retain the fragments that have managed {{to pass through the}} mat. Blasting blankets are used for both horizontal and vertical blasting. Blasting blankets consist of a fine-mesh strong net or industrial <b>felt</b> from <b>paper</b> mills. Both mats and blankets are designed to let air and gasses from the explosion pass through the cover and retain fragments.|$|R

50|$|Aluminium {{silicate}} {{is a type}} of {{fibrous material}} made of aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide, (such materials are also called aluminosilicate fibres). These are glassy solid solutions rather than chemical compounds. The compositions are often described in terms of % weight of alumina, Al2O3 and silica, SiO2. Temperature resistance increases as the % alumina increases. These fibrous materials can be encountered as loose wool, blanket, <b>felt,</b> <b>paper</b> or boards.|$|E

50|$|<b>Felt</b> <b>paper</b> is {{available}} in several grades, the most common being Type 1 - commonly called 15-pound (15#) or No. 15 (#15) - and Type 2 - commonly called 30-pound (30#) or No. 30 (#30). The weight designations originated with organic base felt weighing 15 or 30 pounds per 100 sq. ft. (15 lb or 30 lb per 100 sq ft). However, modern base felts are made of lighter-weight fibre, so the weight designations, though common colloquially, are no longer literally accurate.|$|E
