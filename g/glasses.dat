5|$|Phosphorus, {{selenium}} and lead, {{which are}} less often recognised as metalloids, {{are also used}} in <b>glasses.</b> Phosphate glass has a substrate of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), rather than the silica (SiO2) of conventional silicate <b>glasses.</b> It is used, for example, to make sodium lamps. Selenium compounds can be used both as decolourising agents and to add a red colour to glass. Decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PbO. Lead-based <b>glasses</b> have also been extensively used in electronics components; enamelling; sealing and glazing materials; and solar cells. Bismuth based oxide <b>glasses</b> have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead {{in many of these}} applications.|$|E
5|$|Thallium(I) bromide and thallium(I) iodide {{crystals}} {{have been}} used as infrared optical materials, because they are harder than other common infrared optics, and because they have transmission at significantly longer wavelengths. The trade name KRS-5 refers to this material. Thallium(I) oxide has been used to manufacture <b>glasses</b> that have a high index of refraction. Combined with sulfur or selenium and arsenic, thallium has been used in the production of high-density <b>glasses</b> that have low melting points in the range of 125 and 150 °C. These <b>glasses</b> have room temperature properties that are similar to ordinary <b>glasses</b> and are durable, insoluble in water and have unique refractive indices.|$|E
5|$|The glass forms include {{borosilicate}} <b>glasses</b> and phosphate <b>glasses.</b> Borosilicate {{nuclear waste}} <b>glasses</b> are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms {{have the advantage of}} being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they are easy to scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These <b>glasses</b> function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate <b>glasses</b> while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate <b>glasses,</b> which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both <b>glasses</b> have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types. Different <b>glasses</b> often have {{different}} rates of thermal expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently.

When welding different <b>glasses</b> to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some <b>glasses</b> will simply not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.|$|E
