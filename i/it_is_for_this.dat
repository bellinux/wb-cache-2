5|$|Developed {{over many}} centuries, Kraków {{provides}} a showcase setting for many historic styles of architecture. As the city expanded, so too did the architectural achievements of its builders. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{reason that the}} variations in style and urban planning are so easily recognisable.|$|E
5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow trees, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> that {{the species is}} named. However, particular species favoured by the fungus are unclear and may include beech and alder taxa. The mushrooms grow from the ground, often among mosses or detritus. I.saliceticola was first described in 2009, and within the genus Inocybe, the species {{is a part of}} the section Marginatae. The species has been recorded in Finland and Sweden and is relatively common in some areas.|$|E
25|$|About {{the year}} 1529, he and Pedro Moreno {{organized}} sugar plantations and mills at Zempoala, near Veracruz. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> project {{that he needed}} the black slaves.|$|R
25|$|The {{police and}} the {{government}} were {{of the opinion that}} the death penalty deterred offenders from carrying firearms and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that such offences remained punishable by death.|$|R
50|$|During the Battle of Guantanamo Cuba Bannon {{distinguished}} {{himself in}} combat {{and received a}} Brevet promotion to First Lieutenant effective June 13, 1898. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> action that he would later receive the Brevet Medal.|$|R
5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.|$|E
5|$|The {{small size}} of the airport is perhaps best {{illustrated}} {{with the fact that}} a Boeing 757 cannot taxi past another aircraft to parking positions. As a result, controllers are responsible not only for ensuring that valuable space is utilised, but also ensuring that other aircraft are kept circling until larger aircraft are parked. Despite these limitations, the airport successfully handles ten to twenty times more traffic than airports of a comparable size. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that plans to relocate the airport are so important in the short-term scale. In 2006, a NIS 5.5 million renovation programme of Eilat Airport's terminal and runway was undertaken, designed to sustain the airport until it is replaced in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{integration}} {{tends to}} occur in or near oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that {{the integration of the}} virus can greatly {{contribute to the development of}} tumor characteristics.|$|E
50|$|In 1848, {{along with}} Giacomo Margotti, {{he founded the}} newspaper, Armonia ("Harmony") in Turin. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that he fell a victim to the anti-clerical {{influence}} which had deprived him of his post at Superga.|$|R
50|$|His main work 1894/1895 was the Manchester Ship Canal and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{work which}} he was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1895. His company was then renamed from John Jackson Ltd to Sir John Jackson Ltd.|$|R
50|$|He raised two {{companies}} for service during the Boer War. He {{was one of}} the organizers of the Valcartier Military Camp (now CFB Valcartier). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> work that he was knighted. During World War I, he served as a Lieutenant-Colonel of the 171st Battalion.|$|R
25|$|By 1840, {{the area}} of Nova Scotia Gardens had {{degenerated}} into a notorious slum. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that the philanthropist, Angela Burdett-Coutts purchased the land, and, after the leases expired, established Columbia Market in 1869.|$|E
25|$|The term Implementer was the self-given name of {{the creators}} of the text {{adventure}} series Zork. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that game designers and programmers {{can be referred to}} as an Implementer (video games), often shortened to Imp, rather than a writer.|$|E
25|$|Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not {{cleanse the}} hands of organic material, but simply {{disinfect}} them. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain on the hands.|$|E
25|$|Howze {{participated in}} the Pine Ridge Campaign from November 1890 to January 1891. On January 1, 1891, the 6th Cavalry crossed the frozen White River in South Dakota to engage a group of Brulé Sioux. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> action he <b>was</b> {{presented}} with the Medal of Honor.|$|R
50|$|From 1995 until 2009 Whitney {{served as}} an advisor and {{facilitator}} {{in the design and}} development of the United Religions Initiative, a global inter-faith organization dedicated to peace. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> purpose that Whitney and David Cooperrider created the processes that Whitney entitled the Appreciative Inquiry Summit.|$|R
50|$|Howze {{participated in}} the Pine Ridge Campaign from November 1890 to January 1891. On January 1, 1891, the 6th Cavalry crossed the frozen White River in South Dakota to engage a group of Brulé Sioux. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> action he <b>was</b> {{presented}} with the Medal of Honor.|$|R
25|$|A Catechumen (from Latin catechumenus, Greek κατηχουμενος , instructed) is one {{receiving}} {{instruction in}} {{the principles of the}} Christian religion with a view to baptism. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that those who are already validly baptized in another Christian Faith are not known as Catechumens, but rather Candidates.|$|E
25|$|Noseclips {{can prevent}} water from {{getting in the}} nose. However, this is {{generally}} only used for synchronised swimming. Using noseclips in competitive swimming can cause a disadvantage to most swimmers. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that noseclips are only used for synchronised swimming and recreational swimming.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{independence}} of local communities, Jewish ethnicities, even when they circumscribe differences in liturgy, language, cuisine and other cultural accoutrements, are more often a reflection of geographic and historical isolation from other communities. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that communities are referred to by referencing the historical region in which the community cohered when discussing their practices, regardless of where those practices are found today.|$|E
30|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{reason that}} the Middlesborough Consensus {{recommended}} that a disposable Veress needle {{should be used in}} order to reliably hear these important clicks, which signify that these two layers have <b>been</b> penetrated, whereas <b>for</b> all other ports, reusable equipment could be justified on the grounds of economy.|$|R
50|$|Burton was 21 {{years old}} and a private in the 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment, British Army, during the Second World War at Monte Ceco, near Palazzuolo sul Senio, {{north-east}} of Florence when the following deed took place. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> that he <b>was</b> awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|R
2500|$|Señorita was “pretty badly shaken up” {{during one}} {{run to the}} Cascades in 1858, when the {{hurricane}} deck was blown off, and other damage was sustained. [...] According to one source, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason, and high operation costs, that Señorita was soon thereafter withdrawn from service {{and sent to the}} scrapyard.|$|R
25|$|The Catholic Church and {{the ancient}} Christian Churches see priestly {{ordination}} as a sacrament dedicating the person ordained to a permanent relationship of service, and, like Baptism and Confirmation, having an ontological effect on the person. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that a person may be ordained {{to each of the}} three orders only once. They also consider that ordination can be conferred only on males.|$|E
25|$|Go Seigen {{began his}} {{rise to the}} top of {{professional}} go world early. By the time he was 18 he was already a top-flight player belonging to a very small elite. In 1933, along with his great friend Kitani Minoru, Go Seigen developed and popularized the Shinfuseki that broke away from the traditional opening patterns. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> very important contribution that Go Seigen and Kitani Minoru are recognized as the fathers of modern go.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous sodium {{bicarbonate}} is an aqueous solution that is sometimes used for cases of acidosis, or when insufficient sodium or bicarbonate ions {{are in the}} blood. In cases of respiratory acidosis, the infused bicarbonate ion drives the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer of plasma to the left and, thus, raises the pH. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that {{sodium bicarbonate}} is used in medically supervised cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Infusion of bicarbonate is indicated only when the blood pH is markedly (<7.1–7.0) low.|$|E
50|$|During the {{disturbances}} of 1830-32, Melbourne acted vigorously and sensitively, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{that his}} reforming brethren thanked him heartily. Melbourne blamed local magistrates {{for being too}} lenient and the government appointed a Special Commission of three judges to try rioters in the counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Dorset, Wiltshire and Hampshire.|$|R
50|$|His {{part-owner}} Richard Burridge {{has stated}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that Desert Orchid would have struggled in the Grand National: connections felt he could do himself serious injury at the ninety-degree Canal Turn especially on the second circuit (ref. Richard Burridge: The Grey Horse: The True Story of Desert Orchid).|$|R
25|$|In 1947, when Bijan Jazani was 9 years old, {{his father}} joined the Democratic Azerbaijan group {{and in the}} same year with the fall of {{sovereign}} Azerbaijan his father left for the Soviet Union and remained there until 1967. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that Alamtaj Kalantari took Bijan Jazani and his sisters to her parent's home.|$|R
25|$|Kula {{exchange}} {{is the only}} way for an individual to achieve local prestige without local political action. But this prestige is fleeting and does not transform into permanent differences in rank because women's participation is minor and Kula shells lack cosmological authentication. It is not Kula shells but women's cloth wealth that is connected with matrilineal ancestors. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that women retain high prestige and authority despite the fame of male Kula exchange players.|$|E
25|$|While {{it works}} in {{preventing}} speech, {{a person who has}} been stuff gagged can easily spit it out by pushing it with his/her tongue. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that the stuff gag is one of the safest gags to use during self bondage, as the person with his/her hands tied can still spit the gag out if he/she feels any kind of discomfort. However, the risks of asphyxiation and choking are still present for someone who is not careful.|$|E
25|$|The most {{accurate}} figures usually {{belong to the}} air arm fighting over its own territory, where many wrecks can be located, and even identified, and where shot down enemy are either killed or captured. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that at least 76 of the 80 aircraft credited to Manfred von Richthofen can be tied to known British losses—the German Jagdstaffeln flew defensively, on their own side of the lines, {{in part due to}} General Hugh Trenchard's policy of offensive patrol.|$|E
500|$|Mao biographer Lee Feigon {{asserted}} that Mao experienced [...] "a relatively typical childhood". He commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that previous biographers {{had found it}} difficult to [...] "find something fundamentally wrong with Mao from an early age" [...] with which they had hoped to explain his later development into [...] "a revolutionary tyrant".|$|R
2500|$|Murphy {{observes that}} the {{execution}} of a Jewish carpenter by Roman authorities is {{in and of itself}} an ordinary event and did not require divine action. On the contrary, for the crucifixion to occur, God had to limit or [...] "empty" [...] Himself. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that Paul the Apostle wrote, in Philippians 2:5-8: ...|$|R
2500|$|CSX2196 <b>was</b> revised <b>for</b> {{the show}} down at Nassau which allowed {{a more relaxed}} class {{division}} of racing. This allowed the GT cobras to run with prototype Ford GT, GM Grand Sport Corvettes and Lola Mk.6. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> event in 1964 that the Fliptop cobra was used. An aluminium [...] engine was used. However, the car failed to finish.|$|R
