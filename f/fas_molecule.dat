40|$|AbstractFas receptor-induced {{apoptosis}} plays critical {{roles in}} immune homeostasis. However, {{most of the}} signal transduction events distal to Fas ligatlon have not been elucidated.

The activation of Ras is {{a critical component of}} this apoptotic pathway, since Inhibition of Ras by neutralizing antibody or a dominant-negative Ras mutant interfered with Fas-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, ligatlon of Fas also resulted in stimulation of the sphingomyelin signaling pathway to produce ceramides, which, in turn, are capable of inducing both Ras activation and apoptosis. This suggests that ceramides acts as second messengers in Fas signaling via Ras. Thus, ligation of the <b>Fas</b> <b>molecule</b> on lymphocyte lines induces activation of Ras via the action of ceramide, and this activation is necessary, but not sufficient, for subsequent apoptosis...|$|E

AIM: To test HLA-DQ 8 restricted epitope in both native (QYPSGQGSFQPSQQNPQA) and deamidated (QYPSGEGSFQPSQENPQA) forms in an organ culture system of treated coeliac mucosa from HLA-DQ 8 positive and HLA-DQ 8 negative patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Jejunal biopsies obtained from 10 patients with coeliac disease (six HLA-DQ 8 positive and four HLA-DQ 8 negative) were cultured in vitro with a peptic-tryptic digest (PT) of gliadin, or with the native (peptide A) or deamidated (peptide B) peptide.

Furthermore, MHC-I–induced apoptosis did not involve cleavage and activation of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) endonuclease or degrada-tion of genomic DNA into the typical fragmentation ladder, both prominent events of Fas-induced apop-tosis. These results suggest that MHC-I ligation of Jur-kat T cells induce apoptosis through a signal pathway distinct from the <b>Fas</b> <b>molecule.</b> In our search for other signal pathways leading to apoptosis, we found that the regulatory 85 -kD subunit of the phosphoinositide- 3 kinase (PI- 3) kinase was ty-rosine phosphorylated after ligation of MHC-I and the PI- 3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin selectively blocked MHC-I–, but not Fas-induced, apoptosis.

We therefore investigated the possible occurrence of Fas-L-linked suicidal apoptosis of T cells in normal human peripheral blood. For this purpose, we took advantage of immunoelectron microscopy, which allows simultaneous visualization of the morphological apoptotic cellular changes together with surface expression of Fas-L molecules.

Increasing the ionic strength to 50 mM completely abolished the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) signal, suggesting the predominance of electrostatic interactions in the exothermic binding obtained. We developed a theoretical model that explains the complex triphasic ITC profile.

The sorption mechanism of Laurentian fulvic acid (FA) onto these poly(hydroxo aluminum) intercalated bentonites was investigated at different pH values and at different ionic strengths (NaCl or CaCl 2). Three mechanisms contribute to the FA adsorption, depending on the pH and the nature (NaCl or CaCl 2) and ionic strength of the background electrolyte. In the presence of NaCl the FA sorption onto poly(hydroxo aluminum) intercalated bentonites can be mainly ascribed to ligand exchange between the amphoteric poly(hydroxo aluminum) hydroxyl groups and the deprotonated carboxylic groups of the FA. The FA adsorption due to ligand exchange reactions decreases with increasing pH. In presence of Ca 2 + ions the FA adsorption is enhanced, compared {{to the presence of}} Na+, due to Ca 2 + bridging between negatively charged groups on the <b>FA</b> <b>molecules</b> and the poly(hydroxo aluminum) intercalated bentonite. The FA adsorption due to Ca 2 + bridging increases with increasing pH. A third mechanism is enhanced FA adsorption ascribed to FA-Ca-FA bridging and was detected from the FA adsorption in presence of Ca 2 + at the zero point of charge of the poly(hydroxo aluminum) bentonite (pH 5).
