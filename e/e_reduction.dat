40|$|The {{mechanism}} of O 2 reduction at the spinels, Co 3 O 4 and NiCo 2 O 4, in KOH electrolyte is probed using voltammetry at rotating disc and rotating ring-disc electrodes by {{examination of the}} rotation rate dependent limiting currents. The analysis shows that the products and mechanisms at the two spinels are quite different. At the cobalt spinel, {{a substantial amount of}} the 2 <b>e?</b> <b>reduction</b> product, H 2 O 2, is formed while at NiCo 2 O 4 the 4 <b>e?</b> <b>reduction</b> strongly predominates. In terms of both the overpotential for reduction and its limiting current density, the mixed spinel is a substantially better electrocatalyst. It is proposed that the differences arise from an enhanced rate of O-O bond cleavage early in the reduction process at NiCo 2 O 4...|$|E
40|$|Huet and L'evy {{defined the}} (orthogonal) {{strongly}} sequential term rewriting systems, for which index reduction, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>reduction</b> of redexes placed at special positions called (strong) indices, is optimal and normalizing. Despite {{the fact that}} Huet and L'evy give an algorithm to compute indices for the general case, there are many proposals to define subclasses of strongly sequential rewrite systems for which {{this can be done}} more efficiently. In this paper, we show that sometimes it is possible to enlarge such classes by only introducing fixed replacement restrictions, without forcing any sensible modification of the corresponding index reduction strategy. Keywords: functional programming, neededness, replacement restrictions, term rewriting. 1 Introduction For orthogonal term rewriting systems (TRSs), Huet and L'evy gave a formal basis for the definition of efficient sequential strategies, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>reduction</b> sequences in which only one needed redex is reduced in each step [2, 4].

40|$|Background. Previous case-control {{studies on}} bicycle helmet {{efficacy}} are mostly Anglo-Saxon, {{and based on}} data from the early 1990 ’s when hard-shell helmets were common. Methods. In France, the Rhône county (1. 6 million inhabitants) is covered by a road trauma registry that includes ED visits, inpatients and fatalities. Over the 1998 - 2008 period, 13, 797 cyclist casualties were identified (outpatients, inpatients and deceased). The injuries sustained were coded using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) for injuries to the head (AIS 1 + and AIS 3 +), face (AIS 1 +) or neck (AIS 1 +). The study uses a case-control design where the control group includes cyclists injured below the neck, i. e. not injured in the region associated with the helmet. We adjusted for age, gender and crash severity. Results. The adjusted odds ratios of helmeted vs. unhelmeted cyclists are: for AIS 1 + head injuries 0. 69, 95 % CI=[0. 59 - 0. 81], i. <b>e.</b> <b>reduction</b> of risk by 31 %; for AIS 3 + head injuries, 0. 30, 95 % CI=[0. 16 - 0. 50] i. <b>e.</b> <b>reduction</b> of risk by 70 %; for AIS 1 + facial injuries, 0. 72, 95 % CI=[0. 62 - 0. 83], i. <b>e.</b> <b>reduction</b> of risk by 28 %; and for AIS 1 + neck injuries, 1. 18, 95 % CI=[0. 94 - 1. 47], non significant. Conclusion. This study confirms the protective effect for head and facial injuries, even though soft-shell helmets have now become more common. The reduction of risk is greater for serious head injuries. The study is inconclusive about the risk of neck injuries...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of dietary vitamin <b>E</b> <b>reduction</b> on blood cholesterol levels (LDL and total cholesterol). Eight healthy older adults between the ages of 40 and 60 volunteers were used for the study. Subjects acted as their own controls during the two week baseline period in which they ate their normal diet and kept precise diet records [three day diet recalls which were analyzed for vitamin E content using the Diet Analysis program (Food Processor version 8) ]. A vitamin <b>E</b> <b>reduction</b> diet was created for each individual using the same Diet Analysis program. This vitamin <b>E</b> <b>reduction</b> diet was designed to significantly reduce the amount of dietary vitamin E intake of each subject while keeping calories relatively similar throughout a period of three weeks. Fasting blood draws and three day diet recalls were collected every week. Vitamin E intake, total calories, HDL, LDL, TG, and glucose values over the course of this study were compared with a one-way ANOVA using repeated measures. Post-hoc testing using Duncan and Scheffe comparisons were made to indicate any statistically significant difference. Significance was set at p< 0. 05 and all values were reported as x ± SEM. The averaged three day vitamin E intake was reduced by 55 % (20. 3 ± 2. 6 mg to 11. 2 ± 2. 1 mg). There was no significant change in total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, or triglycerides from baseline to the conclusion of the study. The results suggest that short term reduction of dietary vitamin E has no effect on total or LDL cholesterol. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. S. ...|$|E

40|$|A major {{difficulty}} with logic programming is combinatorial explosion: since goals are solved with possibly indeterminate (i. <b>e.,</b> branching) <b>reductions,</b> the resulting search trees may grow wildly. Constraint logic programming systems {{try to avoid}} combinatorial explosion by building in strong determinate (i. <b>e.,</b> non-branching) <b>reduction</b> {{in the form of}} constraint simplification. In this paper we present two concepts, residuation and guarded rules, for further strengthening determinate reduction. Both concepts apply to constraint logic programming in general and yield an operational semantics that coincides with the declarative semantics. Residuation is a control strategy giving priority to determinate reductions. Guarded rules are logical consequences of programs adding otherwise unavailable determinate reductions...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative evaluation is carried out of the transport-related CO 2 <b>e</b> measurement and <b>reduction</b> initiatives in the German logistics sector through ten case study logistics service providers. For each, senior managers are interviewed with the findings synthesised through content-analysis. The initiatives are evaluated against an accepted leading framework model used to categorise CO 2 <b>e</b> emissions <b>reduction</b> initiatives. Findings – The investigated firms, although at different evolutionary stages, understand that logistics and ecology do not, for the most part, contradict each other and both need to be considered in their companies’ long-term planning. The framework used to categorise CO 2 <b>e</b> emissions <b>reduction</b> initiatives in logistics provision is largely confirmed, but also refined. Research limitations/implications – The research reaffirms and refines frameworks developed to encourage and assess green logistics practice, in a specific country's (Germany) logistics industry. Practical implications – The analysis shows strong evidence that the options identified in theory are also valid for the German logistics service provider companies that were investigated. Most of the participating companies apply many of the operational options to reduce the environmental impact, although no one company is pursuing all the possible initiatives. Originality/value – There is a lack of empirical studies which assess the application of green logistics initiatives identified in academic literature to practice.
