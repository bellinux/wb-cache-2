In an interview with Metro Newss Daniella Graham, Lloyd stated that she hoped that the track would help her crack the notoriously tough American market, saying [...] "It's a bit crazy because I don’t expect anyone to know who I am because I live in the UK. I'm from The X Factor and I came fourth. It's crazy and {{it gives me a}} lot of hope.

2500|$|Pollock {{observed}} American Indian sandpainting {{demonstrations in}} the 1940s. Referring to {{his style of}} painting on the floor, Pollock stated, “I feel nearer, more {{a part of the}} painting, since this way <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>walk</b> round it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting. This is akin to the methods of the Indian sand painters of the West.” Other influences on his drip technique include the Mexican muralists and Surrealist automatism. Pollock denied reliance on [...] "the accident"; he usually had an idea of how he wanted a particular piece to appear. His technique combined the movement of his body, over which he had control, the viscous flow of paint, the force of gravity, and the absorption of paint into the canvas. It was a mixture of controllable and uncontrollable factors. Flinging, dripping, pouring, and spattering, he would move energetically around the canvas, almost as if in a dance, and would not stop until he saw what he wanted to see. As another important influence can be cited Wolfgang Paalen's article on Totem Art of the indigenous people of British Columbia and his Fumage paintings which he had seen at Julien Levy's exhibition of Paalen's surrealist paintings in 1940. Pollock owned a signed and dedicated copy of the Amerindian Number of Paalen's magazine (DYN 4-5, 1943), in which the revolutionary space concept in totemist art from the North-West-Coast is broadly discussed from an artist's point of view. Another strong impact must have been Paalen's fumage technique, as it was the surrealist technique with the most magic appeal for those painters who looked for new ways of making appear what was called the unseen or the possible. Fumage was presented also in Matta's workshop about which Steven Naifeh reports: »Once, when Matta was demonstrating the Surrealist technique [...] Fumage, Jackson [...] turned to (Peter) Busa and said in a stage whisper: ›I can do that without the smoke.‹« Pollock's painter friend Fritz Bultman even stated (hinting at the revolutionary possibility-space of Paalen): [...] "It was Wolfgang Paalen, who started it all." ...|$|E
