25|$|There is {{a diverse}} {{classification}} scheme {{for the various}} genomic changes that {{may contribute to the}} generation of cancer cells. Many of these changes are mutations, or changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA. There are also many epigenetic changes that alter whether genes are expressed or not expressed. Aneuploidy, the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is one <b>genomic</b> <b>change</b> that is not a mutation, and may involve either gain or loss of one or more chromosomes through errors in mitosis. Large-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome. Genomic amplification occurs when a cell gains many copies (often 20 or more) of a small chromosomal region, usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material. Translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location. A well-known example of this is the Philadelphia chromosome, or translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia, and results in production of the BCR-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Small-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which may occur in the promoter of a gene and affect its expression, or may occur in the gene's coding sequence and alter the function or stability of its protein product. Disruption of a single gene may also result from integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retrovirus, and such an event may also result in the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants.|$|E

Statin treatment was more effective in increasing NO bioavailability in subjects carrying the CC genotype for the g.-786T>C polymorphism than in TT carriers. Hypertensive patients carrying the TC/CC genotypes and the C allele for the g.-786T>C polymorphism showed better antihypertensive responses to ACEi enalapril. Likewise, patients with erectile dysfunction carrying the C allele for g.-786T>C polymorphism showed better responses to PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil.

Two sets of introgression lines in Brassica napus L. were previously established by its intertribal hybridizations with two wild species and long-term selection. In this study, the methods of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP), sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (SSAP) and methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) were used to determine their <b>genomic</b> <b>change,</b> retrotransposon mobilization and cytosine methylation alteration in these lines. The <b>genomic</b> <b>change</b> revealed by the loss or gain of AFLP bands occurred for ∼ 10 % of the total bands amplified in the two sets of introgressions, while no bands specific for wild species were detected. The new and absent SSAP bands appeared for 9 out of 11 retrotransposons analyzed, with low frequency of new bands and their total percentage of about 5 % in both sets. MSAP analysis indicated that methylation changes were common in these lines (33. 4 - 39. 8 %) and the hypermethylation was more frequent than hypomethylation.

Here, we report on a new approach to construct a hierarchical map of OGRs. Using different types of genomic markers, this approach was applied to two very closely related cucumber genomes [L. var. and L. var. (Royle) Alef. ]. We identified two different levels of OGRs using Mugsy (denoted as dnaOGRs) and i-ADHoRe (denoted as proOGRs). Using information regarding the anchored chromosomes of the two genomes, a third level of OGRs (denoted chrOGRs) could be built at the chromosomal level.

With these methods, the full complexity of the bladder cancer genome has been better appreciated. Using CGH and LOH analyses, it also became apparent that premalignant lesions of the bladder, such as hyperplasia and dysplasia, as well as carcinoma in situ (CIS), showed <b>genomic</b> <b>changes.</b> Whole genome analyses showed that low stage, low grade tumors generally show fewer changes than tumors of higher stage and grade.

40|$|The central paradox {{associated}} with current cancer therapeutic strategies is initially effective treatment, which eliminates a high tumor cell count, consistently results in successful drug resistance. Mathematical and evolutionary modeling have previously suggested that therapeutic intervention could provide selective pressure {{for the expansion}} of resistant variants. Drug-related stress has been {{associated with}} genome chaos, a common phenomenon in cancer characterized as rapid, stochastic genomic fragmentation and reorganization. Since cancer represents an evolutionary process, analysis within the context of genome-mediated cancer evolution can shed light on this key problem of therapeutics. We propose that <b>genomic</b> <b>change</b> is a general response to therapeutics. Drug-induced karyotypic alteration has been linked with transcriptomic elevation, implying that drug-induced <b>genomic</b> <b>change</b> would paradoxically provide an advantage for cancer cells through an increase of genome heterogeneity or evolutionary potential for selection.

To determine whether drug-induced genome change could provide a long-term advantage to cancer cell survival, a karyotypically stable colon cancer cell line was treated with chemotherapy, and growth patterns were followed in a series of in vitro single-cell and population-based experiments. Outlier treated cells displayed faster growth rates than untreated cells, and population-based data support that these outliers may drive cancer progression post-therapy.

The comparison revealed <b>genomic</b> <b>changes</b> related to vasomotor control (cyclooxygenase- 1, angiotensin II receptor), coagulation (F 2 and TFPI), oxidative stress (Mn SOD, GPX 3, and GSR), lipid metabolism (PLA 2 and HPGD), and extracellular matrix (MMPs). A-FABP and MMP 7 were induced by regeneration. RT-PCR revealed upregulation of A-FABP and downregulation of eNOS and TR. The differential gene expression profiles were confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting for eNOS, F 2, Mn SOD, MMP 7, and TR. CONCLUSIONS - Cultures from regenerated coronary endothelial cells exhibit <b>genomic</b> <b>changes</b> explaining endothelial dysfunction and suggesting facilitation of coagulation, lipid peroxidation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. © 2007 American Heart Association, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
