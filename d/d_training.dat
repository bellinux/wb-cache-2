40|$|One of {{the main}} issues in the {{application}} of multiple-point statistics (MPS) to the simulation of three-dimensional (3 D) blocks is the lack of a suitable 3 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> image. In this work, we compare three methods of overcoming this issue using information coming from bidimensional (2 <b>D)</b> <b>training</b> images. One approach is based on the aggregation of probabilities. The other approaches are novel. One relies on merging the lists obtained using the impala algorithm from diverse 2 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> images, creating a list of compatible data events that is then used for the MPS simulation. The other (s 2 Dcd) is based on sequential simulations of 2 D slices constrained by the conditioning data computed at the previous simulation steps. These three methods are tested on the reproduction of two 3 D images that are used as references, and on a real case study where two training images of sedimentary structures are considered. The tests show {{that it is possible to}} obtain 3 D MPS simulations with at least two 2 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> images. The simulations obtained, in particular those obtained with the s 2 Dcd method, are close to the references, according to a number of comparison criteria. The CPU time required to simulate with the method s 2 Dcd is from two to four orders of magnitude smaller than the one required by a MPS simulation performed using a 3 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> image, while the results obtained are comparable. This computational efficiency and the possibility of using MPS for 3 D simulation without the need for a 3 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> image facilitates the inclusion of MPS in Monte Carlo, uncertainty evaluation, and stochastic inverse problems frameworks...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the 3 D face {{hallucination}} {{system is}} proposed on both 2 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> face images {{as well as}} respective 3 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> face models with grey-level. The proposed method hallucinates the 3 D high-resolution model patch using same position of each image patches of interpolated 2 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> image and 3 D high-resolution training face model for low-resolution input image. Firstly, the optimal weights of the 2 D input low-resolution image position-patches are estimated with the corresponding 2 D low-resolution training image patches. The canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is used to learn the mapping between the 2 D interpolated face training image and the 3 D face model {{with respect to their}} weights. Secondly, the corresponding 3 D face model patch with weight by matching high score among the 2 D interpolated training image patches and 3 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> face model is selected. Finally, the 3 D high-resolution facial model is formed by integrating the hallucinated 3 D patches which are obtained through mapping patches with respective weights. In order to evaluate the performances of the above approaches, we used example based learning methods to obtain the high-resolution output for a low-resolution input. In this approach, we used the available frontal data sets such as FERET, CAS-PERL and CMU to analysis the performance and some parameters are also considered, which may affect the results from the above proposed method...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the Ed. D. and the Ph. D. in Education degrees. Both degrees socialize students into a profession based in service, that enjoys autonomy, {{and that is}} grounded in a knowledge base. However, the Ed.

Web-based surveys with different students confirmed the high frequency of curiosity and/or problem solving as the primary reason students planned research careers. No evidence was found for differences among men, women, and minority and nonminority students. Although these results seem logical compared with successful scientists, their constancy, predictive capabilities, and sharp contrast to students who chose clinical medicine were striking.

At 2, 7, 14, or 30 <b>d</b> after <b>training,</b> the first retention test was performed and hemicholinium (HC- 3, 1. 0 μg/mice), a specific inhibitor of high-affinity choline uptake in brain cholinergic neurons, was given intracerebroventricularly immediately after. Twenty four hours after treatment, mice were tested in an inhibitory avoidance task during five consecutive days, each 24 h apart. Retention performance was impaired by HC- 3 when the first re-exposure took place at 2, 7, or 14 d, but the effect was no longer seen when re-exposure occurred 30 <b>d</b> after <b>training.</b> We did not find spontaneous recovery 21 <b>d</b> after <b>training,</b> when memory was retrieved 2 <b>d</b> after <b>training</b> and HC- 3 was given immediately after. Although we cannot definitively discard a retrieval deficit, this lack of spontaneous recovery is in accordance with the storage-deficit interpretation. These results confirm and extend previous ones, suggesting that central cholinergic mechanisms are involved in the hypothetical reconsolidation memory processes of an inhibitory avoidance task in mice and also suggest that this participation depends on the “age” of the original memory trace. This implies that the vulnerability of a reactivated memory to a specific treatment, as the one used in this study, inversely correlates with the age of the original memory, and it is likely to determine memory reconsolidation processes...|$|R
40|$|Multiple-point {{statistics}} (MPS) is {{a rising}} method for {{the characterization of}} heterogeneity. Its strength and its Achilles' heel lie in the training image, which is the conceptual model of geological heterogeneity on which MPS simulations are based. Indeed, on one side {{the use of the}} training image allows great flexibility when for example for bi-dimensional (2 D) simulation a training image can be provided by a photo-mosaic of an outcrop or by a sketch drawn by a geologist. On the other side, in three-dimensions (3 D) a training image is rarely available. When the information provided by a 3 D image is not accessible, then one must somehow use probabilistic information which comes from lower dimen- sion sources, like for example 2 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> images. If different 2 D sources of information are available, one possibility is to aggregate the corresponding probability information. This problem is very general and several methods exist. Two main categories of methods are distinguished: those based on the sum (convex) and those based on the multiplication (non-convex). When the weighting factors can be determined from some training data, the best reliabilities are obtained with the Beta-transformed linear pool and the Bor- diey's formula. Instead, when training data are not accessible, reasonably reliable results can be obtained with the Bordley's formula and with the Markovian-type categorical prediction. One convex method and one non-convex method are tested for the ag- gregation of information coming from 2 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> images. For the tests, one 3 D image of a micro-computed tomography of a sandstone and one 3 D realization of a fluvio-glacial environment are used as references. Two di- mensional slices of the reference 3 D images are used as training images for providing the information to be aggregated with the methods cited above, but also for the simulation with two novel method proposed here. One of this methods is baaed on sequential 2 D simulations conditioned by the data computed during the previous simulation steps (method s 2 Dcd). With this last method it is possible to obtain, without the use of a 3 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> im- age, 3 D simulations which can be considered close to the reference images according to most comparison criteria considered. Moreover, while the re- sults obtained with the method s 2 Dcd are close to the results obtained with a MPS simulation which make use of a 3 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> image, the CPU time required by s 2 Dcd is from two to four orders of magnitude smaller than with a traditional 3 D simulation. This computational efficiency is a step forward for the introduction of MPS in frameworks which require a great number of realizations in a reasonably restricted amount of time, like for example Monte Carlo methods or stochastic inverse problems. Other techniques exists to deal with the simulation in 3 D when a 3 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> image is not available. One of this techniques, developed in this thesis' framework, is applied for the simulation of the image of the fluvio- glacial aquifer analog used as reference for the tests depicted above. It is a hierarchical technique: six parallel outcrops mapped during a quarry excava- tion serve to recognize geological features at different scales and on different depositional layers. Once the complexity of the observed heterogeneity is simplified, object based techniques are used to simulate 3 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> images containing simple shapes. Maps of the orientation of the main geological structures are created by interpolating orientations derived from morpholog- ical analysis. All these information are then included in a MPS simulation framework. The geological heterogeneity reproduced using this technique is realistic and can provide an high-resolution benchmark for fluid flow and transport problems. In summary, this thesis demonstrates that is is possible to apply MPS methods obtaining credible results from a geological point of view even in absence of a 3 <b>D</b> <b>training</b> image...|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{motor skill}} {{training}} induces reorganization of movement representations and synaptogenesis within adult motor cortex. Motor skill does not, however, develop uniformly across training sessions. It {{is characterized by}} an initial fast phase, followed by a later slow phase of learning. How cortical plasticity emerges during these phases is unknown. Here, we examine motor map topography and synapse number within rat motor cortex during the early and late phases of motor learning. Adult rats were placed in either a skilled or unskilled reaching condition (SRC and URC, respectively) for 3, 7, or 10 d. Intracortical microstimulation of layer V {{was used to determine}} the topography of forelimb movement representations within caudal forelimb area of motor cortex contralateral to the trained paw. Quantitative electron microscopy was used to measure the number of synapses per neuron within layer V. SRC animals showed significant increases in reaching accuracy after 3, 7, and 10 <b>d</b> of <b>training.</b> In comparison with URC animals, SRC animals had significantly larger distal forelimb representations after 10 <b>d</b> of <b>training</b> only. Furthermore, SRC animals had significantly more synapses per neuron than URC animals after 7 and 10 <b>d</b> of <b>training.</b> These results show that both motor map reorganization and synapse formation occur during the late phase of skill learning. Furthermore, synaptogenesis precedes map reorganization. We propose that motor map reorganization and synapse formation do not contribute to the initial acquisition of motor skills but represent the consolidation of motor skill that occurs during late stages of training.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that male rats have an advantage in acquiring place-learning strategies, allowing them to learn spatial tasks more readily than female rats. However many of these differences have been examined solely during acquisition or in 24 h memory retention. Here, we investigated whether sex differences exist in remote long-term memory, lasting 30 <b>d</b> after <b>training,</b> and {{whether there are differences}} in the expression pattern of molecular markers associated with long-term memory maintenance. Specifically, we analyzed the expression of protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ) and the α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GluA 2. To adequately evaluate memory retention, we used a robust training protocol to attenuate sex differences in acquisition and found differential effects in memory retention 1 d and 30 <b>d</b> after <b>training.</b> Female cohorts tested for memory retention 1 <b>d</b> after 60 <b>training</b> trials outperformed males by making significantly fewer reference memory errors at test. In contrast, male cohorts tested 30 <b>d</b> after 60 <b>training</b> trials outperformed females of the same condition, making fewer reference memory errors and achieving significantly higher retention test scores. Furthermore, given 60 training trials, females tested 30 d later showed significantly worse memory compared to females tested 1 d later, while males tested 30 d later did not differ from males tested 1 d later. Together these data suggest that with robust training males do no retain spatial information as well as females do 24 h post-training but maintain this spatial information for longer. Males also showed a significant increase in synaptic PKMζ expression and a positive correlation with retention test scores, while females did not. Interestingly, both sexes showed a positive correlation between retention test scores and synaptic GluA 2 expression. Furthermore, the increased expression of synaptic PKMζ, associated with male memory but not with female memory, identifies another potential sex-mediated difference in memory processing...|$|R
