[...] "All I know is what I'm seeing online," [...] Morgan said. [...] "I am so thrilled and touched and excited about the fan reaction and about people talking about the first one and how it relates to the second one.

She spoke out against the November 2015 shooting at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic. She is a feminist, a concept she argues should not intimidate people [...] "because <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>means</b> equality". Lawrence promotes body positivity among women. In 2015, she wrote an essay for the Lenny Letter in which she criticized the gender pay gap in Hollywood. She wrote about her own experiences in the industry, such as the lesser salary she received for her work in American Hustle compared to her male co-stars. In a 2015 interview with Vogue, Lawrence criticized Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis for her opposition to same-sex marriage. Lawrence was [...] "raised a Republican", but has subsequently criticized the party's stance on women's rights. [...] She has strongly opposed Donald Trump's presidency, stating in 2015 that his election would [...] "be {{the end of the}} world".|$|E

[...] "Dread and the Fugitive Mind" [...] was released on the [...] compilation a year earlier, at the insistence of Megadeth's former label, Capitol Records. The album's opener, [...] "Disconnect", is explained by Mustaine as being about living a double life and [...] "the person I want you to think that I am and the person inside that I really know I am." [...] "Coming Home" [...] was only available on the Japanese pressing as a bonus track, but has since been released on the Warchest box set. Mustaine has stated that concept for [...] "Promises" [...] is [...] "prejudiced relationships," [...] such as those between a Catholic and a Protestant in Ireland, interracial and same-sex relationships, [...] "it could be about a guy and a sheep for all I care. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>means</b> that if we can't be together in this life, maybe we'll make it in the next." ...|$|E

We investigate the case where D is not invariant over any small subset. If T is geometric and (M,D) is an H-structure (in the sense of A. Berenstein and E.

500|$|... "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel Powell and {{directed}} by Aaron Augenblick. Series creator Devin Clark said that they planned on giving it a summer theme since they knew it would air in the summer. Clark further elaborated on the decision to incorporate summer and Harry Potter themes into the episode, stating: [...] "We went, 'alright, those are two little nuggets of ideas we can incorporate into that.' We can't be as relevant to pop culture as some other shows, but <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>means</b> {{we have a little}} more of a challenge of making jokes that are a little more evergreen and poking fun of the genre in a much broader spectrum." [...] Screenwriter Powell explained that it is difficult for the series to do [...] "topical stuff" [...] as it takes up to nine months to complete an episode, but they were {{aware of the fact that}} the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 would premiere shortly after the episode was set to air. [...] "So it would seem like we were hyper-topical, even though we had a good nine months advance notice", he said. Powell said that they included famous wizards from many other sources, including The Lord of the Rings and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In an interview with Charles Webb of MTV, Clark elaborated: [...] "We make it a hodgepodge of the wizard references and obviously the main one is, and the most prominent one and the one that's most relevant to pop culture is the Harry Potter spoof that we've thrown in there.|$|E
500|$|The fifth track, [...] "The Other Side", has churning, chunky guitars, a double-bass {{drum and}} Lee's [...] "ethereal, widescreen" [...] vocals with {{elements}} of R. Lyrically, the song's theme is death. [...] "Erase This", formerly titled [...] "Vanilla", was noted by Mary Ouellette of Loudwire as an [...] "uptempo rocker" [...] similar to [...] "What You Want" [...] which would sound better played live {{rather than through}} earphones. [...] "Lost in Paradise" [...] is a symphonic rock ballad which begins with piano, strings and Lee's unlayered vocals before adding the band for the song's climax; its lyrics reflect Lee's past struggles, apologizing to her fans for the band's five-year absence. The song's musical structure was compared to [...] "Jóga", by the Icelandic recording artist Björk. [...] "Sick" [...] has a loose, lazy melody and a chanted chorus; {{one of the first}} songs written for the album, it [...] "set a heavy direction {{for the rest of the}} record." [...] "End of the Dream" [...] begins [...] "full bore with chunky guitar, then falls into a brooding grove with piano underpinning Lee's unmistakable vocals." [...] In the chorus, Lee sings [...] "Follow your heart 'til it bleeds," [...] evincing the track's [...] "seize the day" [...] message. Lee said about the song, [...] "It's about understanding that this life isn't forever, and how you have to live it, embrace even the pain, before it's all over. As much as it hurts, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>means</b> you're alive. So don't be so afraid to get hurt that you miss out on living." [...] "Oceans" [...] begins with a big, low synth and a vocal before the band joins in. According to Lee, [...] "It's big and lush. We've been having a lot of fun playing that one especially." [...] "Never Go Back" [...] (originally called [...] "Orange") examines [...] "loss from the perspective of someone losing someone in a tragedy". Lee said that the song, with the lyrics [...] "It's all gone, the only world I've ever known", was inspired by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. [...] "Swimming Home" [...] is an electro-pop song with grinding guitars and a [...] "weeping" [...] piano.|$|E

Several linguistic researchers also suggest that another derivation is possible: Before the introduction of refrigerators by Lindes in the 1870s, the reservoir was also used to provide ice. At that time, during the late winter, ice was broken and carried on horse and cart to the ice cellars and ice houses of the breweries and pork butchers in the surrounding area.|$|R

[...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight.

And after the episode came out, the actress said her children kept calling her treacle! A couple of scriptwriters wanted to stop it - they didn't want any catchphrases. But one lovely writer put it in so I could say {{it was in the}} script! And it stuck. Poor people couldn't afford sugar so put treacle in their tea.

50|$|The {{rapid rise}} in the number of UK food banks since 2009 has often been used as {{evidence}} of growing hunger.

Regression analysis published by Oxford University in 2015 found that it is largely need not simply awareness of foodbanks that is causing the growth in usage.
