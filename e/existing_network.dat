Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights project.|$|E
5|$|Currently Silverthrone is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active the volcano's magma system is. The <b>existing</b> <b>network</b> of seismographs {{has been established}} to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is {{too far away to}} provide a good indication of what is happening beneath the caldera. It may sense an increase in activity if the volcano becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption.

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19thcentury, the USACE dredged {{channels}} and built locks and levees in the Willamette's watershed. Although products such as lumber were often transported on an <b>existing</b> <b>network</b> of railroads in Oregon, these advances in navigation helped businesses deliver more goods to Portland, feeding the city's growing economy. Trade goods from the Columbia basin north of Portland could also be transported southward on the Willamette due to the deeper channels made at the Willamette's mouth.|$|E
5|$|London has 330km (205mi) {{of cycling}} paths {{throughout}} the city, 91km (59mi) {{of which have}} been added since 2005. In June 2016, London unveiled its first bike corrals, which replace parking for one vehicle with fourteen bicycle parking spaces, and fix-it stations, which provide cyclists with simple tools and a bicycle pump, throughout the city. In September 2016, city council approved a new 15 year cycling master plan that will see the construction of an additional 470km (292mi) of cycling paths added to the <b>existing</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E
30|$|Whether {{we really}} need to place magnetometers closer than 100 km apart is largely a moot point since <b>existing</b> <b>networks</b> have a vastly greater average spacing than this. Many of the fine-scale {{variations}} are associated with sub-storms, which we maintain cannot be adequately characterized from the ground with <b>existing</b> <b>networks.</b> Improving this situation within reasonable budget constraints has been a primary motivating factor in our development of low-cost magnetometers.|$|R

5|$|Service on the Orange Line {{began on}} November 20, 1978 between National Airport and New Carrollton, with five new {{stations}} {{being added to}} the <b>existing</b> <b>network</b> from Stadium–Armory. When the line from Rosslyn to Ballston–MU was completed on December 11, 1979, Orange Line trains began following this route rather than going to the National Airport station. The line was completed on June 7, 1986, when it was extended by four stations to Vienna in the I-66 median.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{plans to}} {{complete}} the Northern Heights project were reviewed. In early 1946, {{the conversion of the}} LNER line from Mill Hill East to Edgware was scheduled by the LPTB for completion between January 1947 and June 1948. No work was carried out as maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the <b>existing</b> <b>network</b> had the greatest call on London Underground funds. Funds for new works were severely limited and priority was given to the completion of the western and eastern extensions of the Central line to West Ruislip, Epping and Hainault.

5|$|Although {{it always}} had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the <b>existing</b> <b>network</b> of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates.|$|E

5|$|Increased support also materialised {{when the}} Bygdefolkets Krisehjelp, the Norwegian Farmers' Aid Association, sought {{financial}} aid from Nasjonal Samling, {{who in turn}} gained political influence and a useful <b>existing</b> <b>network</b> of well-trained party officers. Quisling's party never managed a grand anti-socialist coalition, however, {{in part because of}} competition from the Conservative Party for right-wing votes. Though Quisling remained unable to demonstrate any skill as an orator, his reputation for scandal nonetheless ensured that the electorate were aware of Nasjonal Samling's existence. As a result, the party showed only moderate success in the October elections, with 27,850 votes—approximately two per cent of the national vote, and about three and a half per cent of the vote in constituencies where it fielded candidates. This made it the fifth largest party in Norway, out-polling the Communists but not the Conservative, Labour, Liberal or Agrarian parties, and failing to secure a single seat in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear lamina is {{composed}} mostly of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later {{transported to the}} nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the <b>existing</b> <b>network</b> of nuclear lamina. Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil, that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase. Lamin structures {{that make up the}} veil, such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.|$|E
5|$|A northwestern {{expansion}} of the City Circle Line was planned, where M4 would divert at Nørrebro and run to the suburbs of Brønshøj and Gladsaxe. This project was abandoned, as the interchange chamber between any such line and the City Circle Line was scrapped {{as part of the}} City of Copenhagen's 2009 budget. In subsequent plans, the northern extension of the M4 has instead been relocated as a Nordhavn branch which will connect with the City Circle Line at Østerport. A Nordhavn line with two stations has been approved by the Danish parliament, and is planned to open in 2019. The southern extension of the M4 will run from Copenhagen Central Station through Sydhavn to Ny Ellebjerg, where the M4 will link up with the S-train and regional train system. The Danish Transport Authority (Trafikstyrelsen) has suggested to convert the F-line of the S-train network to metro standard as an M5 line, but as the only linkup between the M5 and the <b>existing</b> <b>network</b> would be at Flintholm Station (interchange with M1 and M2), this plan is dependent on the approval of a southern extension of the M4, also providing the M5 with an interchange with the M4 at Ny Ellebjerg Station.|$|E

3000|$|Next {{generation}} networks (NGN) (or 4 G, as {{they are}} better known) are to provide voice, data and multimedia access to users on an [...] "anytime" [...] and [...] "anywhere" [...] basis. This vision of 4 G forms the requirement to achieve high throughput, high energy efficiency and low latency to provide quality of service (QoS) and efficient utilization of the scarce bandwidth. Therefore 4 G networks are expected {{to result in a}} better quality of life and environment. Another important requirement for next generation networks is backward compatibility with <b>existing</b> <b>networks.</b> In today's world, due to reasons such as cost and lack of infrastructure, it may not be possible for all to adapt new networks at once and make the existing ones obsolete. This may happen eventually with time; however, we expect to have a hybrid of the new and <b>existing</b> <b>networks</b> for quite some time. It is of high importance to have smooth interaction between <b>existing</b> <b>networks</b> and next generation networks. This intermediate period where both networks will coexist is an important step towards complete transition to next generation networks which ensures a better quality of life and environment. For developed and developing countries which have made much investment on <b>existing</b> <b>networks</b> and due to high number of users, it may take longer to completely migrate to next generation networks. However for underdeveloped countries who still lacks infrastructure the adaptation may be easy but there are cost constraints for them as well.|$|R
