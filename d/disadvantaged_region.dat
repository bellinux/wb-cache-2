There is also a problem of a paucity of research showing how foreign investment had been involved in evolutionary processes of regional economic change. The paper shows that a more complete appreciation of the role of inward investment needs to consider not only its role in job creation but also the relative stability of the investment and jobs attracted. The paper reveals how analysis of plant birth and deaths also links through to perspectives offered by evolutionary economic geography, and how patterns of entry and exit might work to influence the economic trajectories of a <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>region</b> such as Wales...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} purposes are to analyse the intra-regional disparity {{and economic growth}} In East Java's region, the potential sectors to be developed, and to classify regions and sector in East Java based on its economic growth and per capita income. Methods that being used are economic growth analysis, Location Quotient (LQ), Shift-share, Sectoral Typology, Williamson Index, Theil Index, Pearson Correllation and Kusnetz hypothesis. The number of disadvantaged area in East Java also has to be addressed, which has reached 23 regions. Intra-regional economic disparity in 2008 - 2012 is above 0. 5 (0, 4295) and continously increasing.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a school-university {{partnership}} project that aimed to bring together the diverse expertise of university researchers and school-based practitioners {{to address the problem}} of low literacy educational attainment levels in a cluster of schools in a <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>region</b> in Queensland.

Contrary to the state government’s current trend towards additional outside testing and the use of ‘flying squads ’ of external experts to deal with ‘problems ’ of low achievement levels in Queensland schools, our analysis suggests that the partnership work with teachers in schools is a complex process that involves the creation of long-term relationships that build on mutual trust and respect and achieve the disruption of teachers ’ everyday teaching routines by introducing learning opportunities that are flexible, responsive and, most importantly, give greater agency to the teachers. These suggestions will be elaborated in the paper by bringing examples from the researchers ’ work and by analysing their reflections...|$|E

40|$|Subsidies in {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s fishing {{industry}} have long been considered to have harmful effects on fish stocks. The fishing industry has suffered from overcapacity for many years, and subsidies encourage investment, leading to greater capacity and more pressure on fish stocks, {{many of which are}} already exploited close to extinction. However, this paper argues, that not all fishery subsidies have this effect on the fish resource. In Ireland, there is evidence suggesting that fishery subsidies are used increasingly for the purpose of employment creation in <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>regions,</b> through land-based investments, rather than to increase fishing capacity. Abolishing fishery subsidies in Ireland is, therefore, not likely to have huge effects on the fishing fleet, while the effects on rural communities could be grave.
