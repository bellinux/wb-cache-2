40|$|A {{systematic}} approach to constructing the contrasts {{of interest for}} a biological experiment is obtained {{by the use of}} orthogonal polynomials. In completely randomized and randomized block designs no difficulty arises in partitioning between dose sum of squares into single degrees of freedom allocated to the contrasts representing preparations, linearity, deviation from parallelism, quadratic qurvature, deviation from quadratic curvature and so forth depending on the number of doses in the experiment. In incomplete block designs the contrasts of interest are taken to be eigenvectors of the C matrix in order to partition the adjusted treatment sum of squares. The C matrix is obtained from the intra-block normal equations, Q=Ct. Results on the C matrix along with its spectral decomposition and the Moore- Penrose generalized inverse are given.

Likewise, difference equations have been utilized as approximations to ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs) because of the improvement of rapid advanced processing hardware. It tends to be said that difference equations identify with differential equations as discrete mathematics identifies with continuous mathematics. Any individual who has made an investigation of differential equations will realize that even elementary examples can be difficult to solve. By <b>contrast,</b> <b>elementary</b> difference equations are moderately simple to study. For many reasons, computer scientists take an interest difference equations. For instance, difference equations often emerge while determining the cost of an algorithm in big-O notation. In 1943, the difference equations were commonly used for solving partial differential equations. Problems involving time-dependent fluid flows, neutron diffusion and transport, radiation flow, thermonuclear reactions, and problems involving the solution of several simultaneous partial differential equations are being solved by the use of difference equations. Other than the utilization of difference equations as approximations to ODEs and PDEs, they afford a powerful method for the analysis of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and other systems {{in which there is a}} recurrence of identical sections. By using the difference equations, the investigation of the conduct of electric-wave filters, multistage amplifiers, magnetic amplifiers, insulator strings, continuous beams of equal span, crankshafts of multicylinder engines, acoustical filters, etc., is enormously facilitated. The standard techniques for solving such systems are generally very lengthy when the number of elements involved is large. The use of difference equations greatly reduces the complexity and labor in problems of this type.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It is {{well known}} that the {{deterministic}} dynamics of biochemical reaction networks can be more easily studied if timescale separation conditions are invoked (the quasi-steady-state assumption). In this case the deterministic dynamics of a large network of elementary reactions are well described by the dynamics of a smaller network of effective reactions. Each of the latter represents a group of elementary reactions in the large network and has associated with it an effective macroscopic rate law. A popular method to achieve model reduction in the presence of intrinsic noise consists of using the effective macroscopic rate laws to heuristically deduce effective probabilities for the effective reactions which then enables simulation via the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). The validity of this heuristic SSA method is a priori doubtful because the reaction probabilities for the SSA have only been rigorously derived from microscopic physics arguments for elementary reactions. Results We here obtain, by rigorous means and in closed-form, a reduced linear Langevin equation description of the stochastic dynamics of monostable biochemical networks in conditions characterized by small intrinsic noise and timescale separation. The slow-scale linear noise approximation (ssLNA), as the new method is called, is used to calculate the intrinsic noise statistics of enzyme and gene networks. The results agree very well with SSA simulations of the non-reduced network of <b>elementary</b> reactions. In <b>contrast</b> the conventional heuristic SSA is shown to overestimate the size of noise for Michaelis-Menten kinetics, considerably under-estimate the size of noise for Hill-type kinetics and in some cases even miss the prediction of noise-induced oscillations. Conclusions A new general method, the ssLNA, is derived and shown to correctly describe the statistics of intrinsic noise about the macroscopic concentrations under timescale separation conditions. The ssLNA provides a simple and accurate means of performing stochastic model reduction and hence it is expected to be of widespread utility in studying the dynamics of large noisy reaction networks, as is common in computational and systems biology. </p...|$|R

The study looks at the concepts of fairness and respect as they relate to trust development and describes where and in what circumstances members of the inner city community feel that they either are or are not being treated fairly and with respect in educational settings. ^ A model of typical classroom arrangements is offered as a way of understanding not only issues of power and control but also the roles which safety and respect play in the development of trust relationships and the quality of educational outcomes. An alternative model, the pastoral care model, is suggested as a more satisfactory approach to inner city education and one which allows both students and teachers to learn together and to grow from their mutual encounters. The study urges a paradigm shift away from professional distancing and towards an appreciation of the benefits gained from allowing teachers and students to relate naturally in a family-like atmosphere where love and trust are acknowledged, fostered, and valued. ...|$|R
