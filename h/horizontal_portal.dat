The main variable determinants for the three groups were found to be: convenience – the main influence in favor of virtual shopping; preference for the real shop and the fact of not being fond of shopping without seeing and feeling the product – the main influence for giving up virtual shopping; and, for those who do not use this form of shopping, the disliking the idea of shopping without seeing and feeling the product. e-commerce, consumer behavior, internet,...|$|R

The only way to achieve it is through cross-market bundling; that is, portals selling their products packaged with Internet access and proprietary content through system competition.

Still, interest in this industry is huge, which is understandable if one analyzes the industry within its online value network. As we show, horizontal portals constitute a critical link in this network, as it is both a way of organizing content, which seems to be the king of the future, and captures and canalizes the incoming traffic of the Internet Service Providers.

40|$|A portal (or Web portal) {{presents}} {{information from}} diverse sources in a unified way. A Web site {{that offers a}} broad array of resources and services, such as e-mail, forums, search engines, online shopping are referred to as portal. The first portals grow out of online services, such as AOL, and provided access to the Web, but by now most of the traditional search engines have transformed themselves into Web portals to attract and keep a larger audience. Apart from the basic search engine feature, these portals often offer services such as e-mail, news, stock prices, information, and entertainment. Portals provide a way for enterprises, research and other communities to generate a consistent look and feel with access control and procedures for multiple applications, which otherwise would have been different entities altogether. In a research environment a portal integrates online scientific services into single Web environment which can be accessed and managed from a standard Web browser. The most remarkable benefit of portals is that they simplify the interaction of users with distributed systems and with each other, because a single tool - the browser - and a standard and widely accepted network protocol - HTTP - can be used through all communications. After the proliferation of Web browsers in the mid- 1990 s many companies tried to build or acquire a portal, to have a piece of the Internet market. The Web portal gained special attention because it was, for many users, the starting point of their Web browser. Similarly, but a bit later, research communities recognized the value of Web portals in integrating various services into coherent, customizable environments. Research collaborations began developing portals in the late 1990. These environments can be broadly categorized as <b>horizontal</b> <b>portals,</b> which cover many areas, and vertical portals, which are focused on one functional area. <b>Horizontal</b> research <b>portals</b> often provide services that are independent from any scientific discipline and represent generic functionalities that are common across disciplines. Vertical portals target specific group of researchers that are involved in the same experiment or work within the same scientific field...|$|R

40|$|Web portals {{have been}} one of the first web {{services}} that have helped users to find the information they need in the ever expanding World Wide Web. A web portal is basically a website that groups links to information available on the web. These links are selected based on certain criteria. Some web portals group links that pertain to a certain interest e. g. tennis sport. Such a portal is sometimes classified as a vertical portal since it may include several categories like history of tennis, biographies of players, manufacturers of sport attributes. <b>Horizontal</b> web <b>portals,</b> on the other hand, group links to a specific category of resources. Dictionary portals are a good example of that. In this chapter we will describe the present landscape of dictionary portals. First, we will look at the typology of dictionary portals that has been offered by Engelberg and Müller-Spitzer (2013). Then we present the results of a survey that has been conducted in the context of the COST Action ‘European Network of e-Lexicography’ (ENeL). In that survey we made an inventory of dictionary portals presently in operation (see 49. 2. 3. on Inventory of Dictionary Portals).

A vertical portal focuses on a specific community of users who share a common interest. In this chapter we investigate the impact of user characteristics such as gender, age, experience, and Web use on user satisfaction with Web portals. In our study we are unable to detect any differences in satisfaction based on gender. We find that the users with seven to 10 years of work experience are most satisfied with Web portals, while users with more than 10 years work experience report least satisfaction with Web portals. We also find that users that use Web portals the least (30 to 60 minutes per week) are least satisfied with them. Users of vertical (or customer community) portals are always more satisfied than users of horizontal (or mega) portals...|$|E

It is depicted as a one-storey brick building with a stepped gable and white blind windows, a crane hanging over the round arched portal facing the square. A clock was added in the mid-16th century together with a shed for foreign merchants to keep their goods. As two stories were added to the Scales House in 1596-1603, the shed was enlarged into a warehouse and the entire structure transformed into a Renaissance building furnished with an elaborated stone <b>portal,</b> <b>horizontal</b> sandstone fillets, volutes and finials, and a ridge turret covered in copper.
