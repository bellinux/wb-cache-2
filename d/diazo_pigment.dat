40|$|Dyes and {{pigments}} are additives used in polymer {{systems to}} change the original coloration of the material. However, the thermal and photochemical stability of the polymer is frequently affected with the incorporation of these additives. The aim of this work was to study the influence of different colorant types (bismuth vanadate pigment, condensation <b>diazo</b> <b>pigment,</b> Cu-phthalocyanine dye and anthraquinone dye) on the thermo-oxidative stability of polycarbonate. Dynamic thermogravimetric analysis at different heating rate were carried out to evaluate the decomposition behavior of the material and to calculate the activation energy related to the decomposition process according to the FLYNN and WALL method. The curves of conversion rate showed that the polycarbonate with or without colorants present three steps of thermal decomposition, however the decomposition rate in theses steps for polycarbonate containing colorants is almost always higher than in polycarbonate without colorants. This indicates that the colorants accelerate the polycarbonate decomposition. On the other hand, the activation energy did not present the same behavior found to curves of conversion rate, suggesting that the decomposition reaction of polycarbonate does not follow a first order kinetic such as is based the FLYNN and WALL method...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of synthetic {{dyes and pigments}} into commerce in the late 19 th century was a stimulating time for experimental scientists in their laboratory formulations and for artists in their usage. Nowadays, the period of pioneering syntheses and employment of synthetic organic colouring materials is highly intriguing for scientific research and for conservation purposes in heritage science. In this work, a combination of spectroscopic and chromatographic methods has permitted the elucidation of the chemical composition of 16 early synthetic organic pigment powders from the Lefranc experimental laboratory collection dating 1890 - 1914. It can be hypothesized that the most successful of these formulations could have been finalized in paint tubes and released onto the market, meaning that they may even be found in artworks from the same period. Specifically, information from this crucial period of transition from the exclusive use of natural dyes/colourants (such as neoflavonoids and plant and insect anthraquinones) to the {{introduction of}} their synthetic counterparts (such as synthetic alizarin and purpurin, and acid stable cochineal, together with monoazo and <b>diazo</b> <b>pigments)</b> is confirmed through Raman/surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. By means of X-ray fluorescence and mid-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, a combination of traditional and modern inorganic substrates has been identified (alum, kaolin, barium sulfate and metallic salts), while Raman has provided additional data regarding the possible complexation of these pigments in the form of lakes...|$|R
