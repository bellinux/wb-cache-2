500|$|During the Second World War, Singh {{enlisted in}} the 7th Rajput Regiment of the British Indian Army, on 21 November 1941 at Fatehgarh Regimental Centre. On {{completing}} his training, Singh was posted to the regiment's 1st Battalion. During late 1942, the battalion was deployed to the Arakan Province during the Burma campaign, where they fought against the Japanese. The battalion {{was part of the}} 47th Indian Infantry Brigade, assigned to the 14th Indian Infantry Division. It fought actions around the Mayu Range in late 1942 and early 1943, advancing up the Mayu Peninsula towards Donbaik as part of an operation to recapture Akyab Island. Although the Rajputs were held up around the cluster of villages called Kondan in December 1942, the advance slowly continued towards Donbaik. It was there, where the brigade's attack ground to a halt and they were subsequently relieved by the 55th Indian Infantry Brigade in early February 1943. In early April, the Japanese counterattacked. [...] The 47th Brigade became cut off around <b>Indan</b> and eventually split off into small groups to fight their way back to Allied lines. The surviving members of the brigade returned to India. In 1945, Singh's battalion was assigned to the 2nd Indian Infantry Brigade and took over the defence of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The islands had been partially occupied by the Japanese forces, which surendered on 7 October 1945. After returning to India, Singh was promoted to the rank of Naik (corporal). After the partition, the 7th Rajput Regiment was assigned to the Indian Army. Singh remained with the newly raised Indian regiment, continuing to serve in its 1st Battalion.|$|E

500|$|The kraits, as {{they are}} {{commonly}} known, belong to the family Elapidae and the genus Bungarus. The genus is endemic to the continent of Asia. They are morphologically well connected, forming a close-knit and cohesive unit. The genus has 12–13 species who are morphologically distinct from the Naja genus and the Afro-elapids according to McDowell (1987). McDowell stated [...] "species diversity is greatest in Africa, but the Asiatic Bungarus and Ophiophagus are each so peculiar in anatomy as to suggest an ancient divergence". Others, including Slowinski, believed that the kraits (Bungarus), {{are part of a}} clade that clusters with a group including the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) and oddly enough, with the African mambas (Dendroaspis) on the most-parsimonious tree or with Elapsoidea on the maximum-likelihood tree. This result calls into question the monophyly of cobras and underscores the uncertainty of the homology of the hood spreading behavior in cobras and mambas. The relationships of Dendroaspis, Ophiophagus, and Bungarus differed between the parsimony and likelihood analyses, suggesting that more work is necessary to resolve the relationships of these problematic taxa. McDowell's findings in regard to the sister-group of Bungarus and the sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) family, propose that the kraits might just be a per-mutable clade between the elapidae [...] "palatine-erectors" [...] and the hydrophiinae [...] "palatine draggers". Two genera within the hydrophiinae family in particular, support McDowell's hypothesis. The two genera are Salomonelaps and Loveridgelaps due to many shared characteristics. Mao et al. (1983) showed that this species, Bungarus multicinctus was slightly distinct from the other members of its genus and was immunologically more similar to Laticauda, terrestrial Australian elapids, and true sea snakes than it is to Elapsoidea sundevalli (Sundevall's garter snake), Naja naja (<b>Indan</b> cobra) or two Micrurus species (New World or American coral snakes). Minton (1981), Schwaner et al. and Cadle & Gorman (1981) all suggested similar things to Mao et al. (1983) based on immunological data. The many-banded krait was more similar to the Australian elapids, Laticauda and true sea snakes than they were to numerous elapids they were compared to.|$|E

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of {{a series}} of 1, 2 -dihydronaphthalenes substituted in the aromatic ring was investigated with thallium trinitrate (TTN) in methanol or in trimethylorthoformate (TMOF) as solvent. In all cases, <b>indans</b> are produced, although the yield varied from excellent to poor, depending on the structure of the substrate. The presence of an electron-donating group in the substrate favors the rearrangement, whereas significant amounts of glycolic derivatives, as well as naphthalenes, were obtained in the oxidation of 1, 2 -dihydronaphthalenes bearing electron-withdrawing groups, such as Br and NO 2.

The prefactor mobility was found to be of the same order of magnitude as that observed for hole transport materials with a comparable dipole moment. In the framework of the used disorder model, this relationship would suggest a dependence of the wave function decay constant on the molecular dipole moment. This would result in a material dependence of the prefactor mobility, which has also been found for other charge transport molecules. status: publishe...|$|R

In his 1903 catalog, Moore made much of the authenticity of his products. The catalog included photographs of the interior and exterior of the trading post and the land around it, and of Navajo people, outdoor looms and hogans.He said: [...] "While this booklet makes no claim of being a pioneer in its field, I think it may {{claim to be the}} first of its kind published and distributed from the very center of the Navajo Indian Reservation, by an Indian trader living among and dealing directly with the <b>Indans</b> who makes the goods which it illustrates and describes."Moore left the reservation in 1911 due to a scandal.He sold the post to his manager, Jesse A.

40|$|The {{intramolecular}} {{addition of}} an organolithium to a tethered benzyne intermediate {{has been developed}} as a simple route to functionalized benzo-fused carbocycles. Starting with an appropriate ω-(2 -fluorophenyl) alkyliodide, this novel, five-step, one-pot synthetic sequence involves lithium-iodine exchange, ortho-lithiation, loss of LiF to form an aryne intermediate, cyclization, and electrophilic trapping of the resulting aryllithium. Each step is highly dependent on the reaction conditions. Investigations into {{the scope of this}} method show that 4 -substituted <b>indans,</b> 3 -substituted benzocyclobutenes, and 5 -substituted tetralins may be constructed with complete regioselectivity. ^ The cyclization of 6 -heptenyllithium has been investigated for the formation of six-membered rings. While not as facile as the cyclization of the analogous 5 -hexenyllithium, the 6 -exo cyclization has been shown to proceed with complete regioselectivity to generate methylcyclohexane in good yield. Cyclization of methyl-substituted 6 -heptenyllithiums proceeds with modest stereoselectivity. The cyclizations of methyl-substituted 6 -heptenyl radicals were explored for comparison to the anionic cyclizations. ...|$|R
