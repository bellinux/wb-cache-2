25|$|The Jalpa of 1982 {{was named}} for a bull breed; Diablo, for the Duke of Veragua's ferocious bull famous for {{fighting}} an epic battle against El Chicorro in Madrid in 1869; Murciélago, the legendary bull whose life was spared by El Lagartijo for his performance in 1879; Gallardo, named {{for one of the}} five ancestral castes of the Spanish <b>fighting</b> <b>bull</b> breed; and Reventón, the bull that defeated young Mexican torero Félix Guzmán in 1943.

25|$|The Puritans passed animal {{protection}} {{legislation in}} England too. Kathleen Kete writes that animal welfare laws were passed in 1654 {{as part of}} the ordinances of the Protectorate—the government under Oliver Cromwell (1599–1658), which lasted from 1653 to 1659, following the English Civil War. Cromwell disliked blood sports, which included cockfighting, cock throwing, dog <b>fighting,</b> <b>bull</b> baiting and bull running, said to tenderize the meat. These could be seen in villages and fairgrounds, and became associated with idleness, drunkenness, and gambling. Kete writes that the Puritans interpreted the biblical dominion of man over animals to mean responsible stewardship, rather than ownership. The opposition to blood sports became part of what was seen as Puritan interference in people's lives, and the animal protection laws were overturned during the Restoration, when Charles II was returned to the throne in 1660.|$|E
25|$|Domestication {{should not}} be {{confused}} with taming. Taming is the conditioned behavioral modification of a wild-born animal when its natural avoidance of humans is reduced and it accepts the presence of humans, but domestication is the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition toward humans. Human selection included tameness, but without a suitable evolutionary response then domestication was not achieved. Domestic animals need not be tame in the behavioral sense, such as the Spanish <b>fighting</b> <b>bull.</b> Wild animals can be tame, such as a hand-raised cheetah. A domestic animal's breeding is controlled by humans and its tameness and tolerance of humans is genetically determined. However, an animal merely bred in captivity is not necessarily domesticated. Tigers, gorillas, and polar bears breed readily in captivity but are not domesticated. Asian elephants are wild animals that with taming manifest outward signs of domestication, yet their breeding is not human controlled and thus they are not true domesticates.|$|E

2500|$|The Lamborghini Gallardo ( [...] ; [...] ) is {{a sports}} car built by the Italian {{manufacturer}} Lamborghini from 2003 to 2013.

On 25 November 2013, the last Gallardo was rolled off the production line.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{continuation}} of Lamborghini's tradition of naming its cars after stars {{from the world of}} bullfighting, the Murciélago is named for a <b>fighting</b> <b>bull</b> that survived 24 sword strokes in an 1879 fight against Rafael [...] "El Lagartijo" [...] Molina Sánchez, at the Coso de los califas bullring in Córdoba, Spain. Murciélago fought with such passion and spirit that the matador chose to spare its life, a rare honor. The bull, which came from Joaquin del Val di Navarra's farm, was later presented as a gift to Don Antonio Miura, a noted local breeder; thus began the famed Miura line of fighting bulls, and the name for one of Lamborghini's greatest designs.|$|E
