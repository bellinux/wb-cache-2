40|$|Time domain {{reflectometry}} (TDR) is {{a well-established}} electromagnetic technique {{used to estimate}} in situ soil water content, and thermo-TDR {{is an extension of}} the traditional TDR, which can measure both soil water content and thermal properties. Tangent line methods and adaptive waveform interpretation with Gaussian filters (AWIGF) are used in traditional TDR waveform analysis. However, due to the short probe design of thermo-TDR, those methods may not perform well. In this thesis, we present an alternative method in TDR waveform analysis based on the second order bounded mean oscillation (BMO) operator. Numerical analysis and laboratory calibration tests show that the second order BMO can return reasonable results compared with tangent line methods and AWIGF. Second order BMO analysis also performs well for some challenging waveforms. The second order BMO method is not totally automatic due to the large variation of TDR waveforms, and manual adjustment of some parameters is necessary. A MATLAB program of the implementation of second order BMO method is developed, and <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>users</b> of the program is also provided. The results show that second order BMO is a valid alternative method for TDR waveform analysis...|$|E

40|$|This {{project was}} {{concerned}} about simulating wind-diesel systems with differing diesel generators, wind generation and energy storage. The simulating tool {{that was used in}} this project was Microsoft EXCEL. A basic EXCEL ‘one hour’ energy flow model with one type of diesel generator was provided {{at the start of the}} project. The ‘one hour’ model contains average wind and load data recorded at each hour of the year. This basic model was further developed to include: Three types of diesel generator and, Energy storage Other than the basic ‘one hour’ model, different versions of the EXCEL model were also developed, which include: ‘Half hour’ model and, ‘Ten minute’ model The only difference between the ‘half hour’ model and the ‘one hour’ model is that the average wind and load data are different. Therefore, there were not many changes in programming the ‘half hour’ model from the ‘one hour’ model. However, for the ‘ten minute’ model, the operation time of the diesel generators must be considered. Diesel generators do not turn on and off every 10 minutes and hence, the model must be programmed so that the diesel generators operate every 30 minutes or an hour. However, this was not done in the project due to time constraints. A ‘time step’ model was created instead to allow average wind and load data for any time step i. e. 2 hours data, 45 minutes data, 15 minutes data etc., to be pasted into the model. The user-friendliness of the program was also improved to give better understanding by including simple <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>users</b> to use the program more conveniently. The final enhanced one hour model with one type of diesel generator was then compared with HOMER to see how the results differ.

40|$|A {{standardized}} {{new version}} of the "modified total evaporation" (MTE) method for isotopic analysis of uranium samples by multi-collector thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) with high analytical performance is described. The development of the MTE method was organized as a collaboration of several nuclear mass spectrometry laboratories, namely the New Brunswick Laboratory (NBL, U. S. DOE), the Safeguards Analytical Laboratory (SAL, now SGAS-Safeguards Analytical Services) of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Institute for Transuranium Elements (JRC-ITU), and the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (JRC-IRMM). Due {{to the use of the}} “total evaporation” (TE) principle measurements of the "major" ratio 235 U/ 238 U is routinely being performed with an accuracy of 0. 02 %. But the most significant improvement using the MTE method is in the measurement performance achieved for the "minor" ratios 234 U/ 238 U and 236 U/ 238 U. The MTE method provides a measurement performance which, depending on the ratio, is several orders of magnitude superior compared to the IAEA requirement and to the TE method. For routine MTE measurements a detection limit of 3 × 10 - 9 for the 236 U/ 238 U ratio is achieved using an SEM detector combined with an energy filter for detecting the isotope 236 U. The MTE method has proven to be a significant improvement for measuring in particular the "minor" isotope ratios 234 U/ 238 U and 236 U/ 238 U in the frame of performing reference measurements for development and production of certified reference materials at NBL and JRC-IRMM as well as for nuclear safeguards measurements at the IAEA and JRC-ITU. The collaboration between JRC-IRMM and ASTM-International started with the invitation to develop an ASTM standard document for the MTE method in 2013. The recently released new MTE standard ASTM C 1832 - 16 document does not only provide a detailed description and <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>users,</b> it also provides information about the typical analytical performance to be expected.

40|$|Summary In {{recent times}} the options {{available}} to women for antenatal care and birth have expanded. This includes the provision of more midwifery-led care models. This diversification creates a need for common terminology in describing and comparing these models and the outcomes for women and their babies. Hence, the Maternity Care Classification System (MaCCS) was developed to classify, record and report data about maternity models of care in Australia. The MaCCS will produce a data set for reporting on models of care available in each jurisdiction and nationally. As well, the future inclusion of two new data items in the National Perinatal Data Collection to record the model of care for each woman will enable future reporting on outcomes for mothers and babies under different models or by different model characteristics. The MaCCS was developed {{as part of the}} National Maternity Data Development Project (NMDDP), which included a component to design a nomenclature for maternity models of care in Australia. A Maternity Model of Care Data Set Specification (MoC DSS) was then developed to underpin the MaCCS. This DSS contains data elements that capture the characteristics of models, including a Major Model Category (MMC) and a unique model ID. To ensure the data standards were comprehensive and exhaustive, a national pilot of the MoC DSS was conducted. This report provides an account of the pilot process and results. The pilot was conducted over June to September 2014 in a representative mix of birthing sites. It was specifically designed to test the technical aspects of the data elements rather than to test the complete MaCCS as a classification system. The pilot aimed to ensure a number of things: that permissible responses in the data elements were correct and complete, that there were comprehensive <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>users,</b> that values for the 10 MMCs were correct and exhaustive and that all models could be assigned to a single MMC. A total of 46 sites across each jurisdiction in Australia participated, and surveys for 217 maternity models of care were received and analysed. The pilot proved invaluable for refining the DSS. Outcomes included: 	confirmation that the 10 MMCs included in the MaCCS are suitable for classifying all models of care currently in use in Australia, except for 1 emerging model for private obstetrician/private midwife care that will be added to the list of MMCs 	demonstration that the use of data standards alone is not enough to ensure high-quality data collection, particularly when novel concepts are being introduced 	confirmation of the need for a purpose-built electronic data collection tool to improve the accuracy of data collected-and a comprehensive education program to support it. As a result of the pilot, there were over 50 detailed recommendations made including: 	replacing several data elements in the MoC DSS to address major data quality issues and modifying others, with additional instructions in the user guide 	identifying numerous decision-rules/validation checks for incorporation in the specifications for a future electronic MaCCS data collection tool 	defining the areas of focus for any education and training package that is developed. When this report was published, the MoC DSS had been endorsed as a new national data standard, and work is now underway to develop the MaCCS data collection tool...|$|E
