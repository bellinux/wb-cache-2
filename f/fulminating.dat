5|$|In fatal {{cases of}} {{ordinary}} smallpox, death usually occurs between the tenth and sixteenth {{days of the}} illness. The cause of death from smallpox is not clear, but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs. Circulating immune complexes, overwhelming viremia, or an uncontrolled immune response may be contributing factors. In early hemorrhagic smallpox, death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops. Cause of death in hemorrhagic cases involved heart failure, sometimes accompanied by pulmonary edema. In late hemorrhagic cases, high and sustained viremia, severe platelet loss and poor immune response were often cited as causes of death. In flat smallpox modes of death {{are similar to those}} in burns, with loss of fluid, protein and electrolytes beyond the capacity of the body to replace or acquire, and <b>fulminating</b> sepsis.|$|E
5|$|Copper toxicosis, {{also known}} as copper storage disease and copper {{overload}} syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an accumulation of copper in the liver. It {{is closely related to}} Wilson's disease in humans. Bedlington Terriers are more prone to copper toxicosis than most other dog breeds. West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to copper storage disease. Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported, but there have been no reports of neurological involvement in any dog breed. Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons, the disease is caused by a defective metallothionein that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with copper. This causes the cell to store copper in the nucleus. There are three varieties of the disease: the Asymptomatic Form occurs when copper accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder; the <b>Fulminating</b> Form which is seen mostly in young dogs, causes death in two to three days, and is thought to be caused by stress; and the Chronic Form, which is characterized by {{an extended period of time}} in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog. Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, but not nearly to the extent that they accumulate copper.|$|E
5|$|In the early, or <b>fulminating</b> form, hemorrhaging {{appears on}} {{the second or third}} day as sub-conjunctival {{bleeding}} turns the whites of the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky erythema, petechiae, and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, serosa, muscle, and, rarely, the epicardium, liver, testes, ovaries and bladder. Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present. A later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 8–10 days. The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period, and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage. Patients in the early stage of disease show a decrease in coagulation factors (e.g. platelets, prothrombin, and globulin) and an increase in circulating antithrombin. Patients in the late stage have significant thrombocytopenia; however, deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe. Some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin. This form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain. Hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal.|$|E
50|$|Silver <b>fulminate</b> {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1800 by Edward Charles Howard {{in his research}} project to prepare a large variety of <b>fulminates.</b> Along with mercury <b>fulminate,</b> {{it is the only}} <b>fulminate</b> stable enough for commercial use. Detonators using silver <b>fulminate</b> were used to initiate picric acid in 1885, but since have only been used by the Italian navy. The current commercial use has been in producing non-damaging novelty noisemakers as children's toys and tricks.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fulminates</b> are {{chemical}} compounds {{which include the}} <b>fulminate</b> ion. The <b>fulminate</b> ion, [...] is a pseudohalic ion, acting like a halogen with its charge and reactivity. Due to the instability of the ion, <b>fulminate</b> salts are friction-sensitive explosives. The best known is mercury(II) <b>fulminate,</b> which {{has been used as}} a primary explosive in detonators. <b>Fulminates</b> can be formed from metals, such as silver and mercury, dissolved in nitric acid and reacted with ethanol. It is largely the presence of the weak single nitrogen-oxygen bond which leads to its instability. Nitrogen very easily forms a stable triple bond to another nitrogen atom, forming nitrogen gas.|$|R
50|$|A <b>fulminate</b> {{mixture with}} 10-20% {{potassium}} chlorate is cheaper and more brisant than the <b>fulminate</b> alone.|$|R
25|$|Ammonia reacts violently {{with the}} halogens. Nitrogen triiodide, a primary high {{explosive}}, is formed when ammonia {{comes in contact}} with iodine. Ammonia causes the explosive polymerisation of ethylene oxide. It also forms explosive <b>fulminating</b> compounds with compounds of gold, silver, mercury, germanium or tellurium, and with stibine. Violent reactions have also been reported with acetaldehyde, hypochlorite solutions, potassium ferricyanide and peroxides.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To analyse the {{clinical}} characteristics and treatment outcome of zone 1 <b>Fulminate</b> type of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) {{and compare it}} to Conventional ROP. Methods: Preterm infants from two neonatal intensive care units (NICU) born between July 2002 and November 2003 were screened for ROP. Cases with Conventional ROP were classified according to the International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ICROP) while that of <b>Fulminate</b> ROP according to Shapiro&#x 2032;s classification. Threshold disease was kept the cut off for treatment for Conventional ROP and stage 3 A for <b>Fulminate</b> ROP. Results: Of the 54 cases that had treatable ROP, 36 (66. 67 &#x 0025;) had <b>Fulminate</b> type. The mean gestational age and birth weight was higher in <b>Fulminate</b> ROP compared to Conventional disease (31. 75 weeks and 1554 gms vs 31 weeks 1387 gms) whereas the mean postnatal age at laser was lower (4. 62 weeks vs 6. 3 weeks). The average number of laser spots given was 3036. 6 for <b>Fulminate</b> disease. Conclusion: <b>Fulminate</b> ROP had an atypical morphology which was difficult to classify according to ICROP classification {{and we would like}} to lay stress upon the importance of screening of premature infants from the age of 4 weeks and to start treatment immediately once <b>Fulminate</b> ROP has been diagnosed...|$|R

2500|$|The {{series of}} autopsies {{indicated}} that Robinson Hill {{had suffered a}} [...] "massive infection" [...] from an undetermined source, but because the body had been embalmed before an initial examination was conducted, an exact cause of death could not be identified. Dr. Bucklin listed Robinson Hill's cause of death as meningitis and septicemia.

2500|$|He {{was never}} given further command, {{and spent the}} {{remainder}} of the war <b>fulminating</b> about the role of privileged [...] "cavalry generals", who he argued held a disproportionate amount of senior posts when compared to infantrymen, artillerists or engineers. He formally retired from the Army in July 1918, and published a book, A Soldier's-Eye View, the following year. In it, he called for [...] "a true National army", alongside reforms to create a [...] "National church". His suggested reforms included cutting the size of the peace-time regular forces alongside significant reductions in cavalry forces, and reorganising the home and colonial forces for better efficiency. More unusually, he also anticipated strong government control of labour in all spheres – a [...] "national plan of personal service to the state" [...] – and the creation of an [...] "Army Senate" [...] to oversee the organisation and governance of the National Army.

50|$|Between 1807 and 1810, Lepage {{invented a}} new way to fire portative firearms, by using the mercury <b>fulminate</b> priming medium to be fired by the blow of a {{percussion}} hammer. The new method permitted the abandonment of flint-lock firing mechanisms and opened the way to modern firing methods. The new mechanism used a magazine filled with <b>fulminate</b> primer, which would deliver a small amount of priming powder near the gun breech every time the magazine was cocked. Since the <b>fulminate</b> powder was highly sensitive to humidity, methods of coating the <b>fulminate</b> in varnish were developed, as well as methods of encasing the <b>fulminate</b> culminating with the invention of the percussion cap by François Prélat in 1818 and Deloubert in 1820.|$|R

Following the autopsy, Joseph Jachimczyk issued a fresh report in which he observed [...] "It is now my opinion that Joan Robinson Hill came to her death {{as a result of a}} <b>fulminating</b> infectious process, the specific nature of which is no longer determinable." [...] He went on to recommend that the matter be investigated by a grand jury. Dr. Milton Helpern did not issue his report until April 1970, more than a year after the death of Robinson Hill.
