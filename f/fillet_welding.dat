50|$|<b>Fillet</b> <b>welding</b> {{refers to}} the process of joining two pieces of metal {{together}} whether they be perpendicular or at an angle. These welds are commonly referred to as Tee joints which are two pieces of metal perpendicular to each other or Lap joints which are two pieces of metal that overlap and are welded at the edges. The weld is aesthetically triangular in shape and may have a concave, flat or convex surface depending on the welder’s technique. Welders use fillet welds when connecting flanges to pipes, welding cross sections of infrastructure, and when fastening metal by bolts isn't strong enough and wear off easily.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fillet</b> <b>welding</b> {{notation}} {{is important}} to recognize when reading blueprints. The use of this notation tells the welder exactly what is expected from the manufacturer. The symbol for a fillet weld is {{in the shape of a}} triangle. This triangle will lay either below a flat line or above it with an arrow coming off of the flat line pointing to a joint. The flat line is called [...] "reference line". The side on which the triangle symbol is placed is important because it gives an indication on which side of the joint is to be intersected by the weld. It is recognized that there are two different approaches in the global market to designate the arrow side and other side on drawings; a description of the two approaches is contained in International Standard ISO 2553, they are called [...] "A-System" [...] (which is more commonly used in Europe) and [...] "B-System" [...] (which is basically the ANSI/AWS system used in the US). In [...] "A-System" [...] two parallel lines are used as reference line: one is a continuous line, the other is a dashed line. In the [...] "B-System", there is only one reference line, which is a continuous line. If there is a single reference line (B-System) and the triangle is positioned below the line, then the weld is going to be on the arrow side. If there is a single reference line ("B-System") and the triangle is positioned above the line, then the weld is going to be on the opposite side of the arrow.When you find an arrow pointing to a joint with two triangles, one sitting below and one sitting above the line even with each other, then there is intended to be a fillet weld on the arrow side of the joint as well as the opposite side of the joint. If the weld is to be continuous around a piece of metal such as a pipe or square, then a small circle will be around the point where the flat line and arrow pointing to the joint are connected. Manufacturers also include the strength that the weld must be. This is indicated by a letter and number combination just before the flat line. Examples of this are [...] "E70" [...] meaning the arc electrode must have a tensile strength of [...] There are also symbols that describe the aesthetics of the weld. A gentle curve pointing away from the hypotenuse means a concave weld is required, a straight line parallel with the hypotenuse calls for a flat faced weld, and a gentle curve towards the hypotenuse calls for a convex weld. The surface of the weld can be manipulated either by welding technique or by use of machining or grinding tools after the weld is completed. When reading a manufacturers blueprints, you might also come across weld dimensions. The weld can be sized in many different ways such as the length of the weld, the measurements of the legs of the weld, and the spaces between welds. Along with a triangle, there will usually be a size for the weld for example (”x”) to the left of the triangle. This means that the vertical leg of the weld is to be ” whereas the horizontal leg is to ”. To the right of the triangle, there will be a measurement of exactly how long the weld is supposed to be.If the measurements of the drawing are in mm the welds are likewise measured in mm. For example, the weld would be 3 x 10, the mm being understood automatically.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to provide {{practical}} guidelines {{for the design of}} welded joints of steel truss for encased composite steel–concrete beams. The results of experimental tests are presented and interpreted. The steel truss is made of a steel plate acting as the bottom chord, made of S 355 structural steel, coupled with steel rebars which form the upper chord, and steel inclined web rebars (V-reverse) welded to the two chord elements, both of them made of steel B 450 C. Butt welded joints of web bar to bottom steel plate and <b>fillet</b> <b>welding</b> joints of inclined web bars to top chord bars were tested, as they are different from the ones which are normally used due to the coupling of different steel types and complex geometry.

The productivity is depend on accuracy of the welding quality especially at assembly stage. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to decide the component dimension during each assembly stage considering the above situations during the designing stage by exactly predicting welding deformation before the welding is done. Further, if the system that predicts whether welding deformation is equipped, {{it is possible to}} take measures to reduce deformation through FE analysis, helping in saving time for correcting work by arresting the parts which are prone to having welding deformation. For the FE analysis to predict the deformation of a large steel structure, calculation time, modeling, constraints in each assembly stage and critical welding length have to be considered. In case of <b>fillet</b> <b>welding</b> deformation, around 300  mm is sufficient as a critical welding length of the specimen as proposed by the existing researches. However, the critical length in case of butt welding is around 1000  mm, which is far longer than that suggested in the existing researches.
