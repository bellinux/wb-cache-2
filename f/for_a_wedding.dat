500|$|... (The Lord is {{mindful of}} us), , is a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. The early church cantata, {{possibly}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>wedding,</b> {{is difficult to}} date, but is {{generally considered to be}} an early work on stylistic grounds. The text is a passage from Psalm 115, assuring of God's blessing, especially for children. Scholars have suggested the work may have been written for the wedding of Johann Lorenz Stauber, the minister in Dornheim who had married Bach and his first wife there in 1707, and Regina Wedemann, an aunt of Bach's wife, on 5 June 1708.|$|E
500|$|Many of Bach's later church cantatas were {{composed}} for {{the requirements of}} the liturgical calendar, but the early ones, including Der Herr denket an uns, were written for special occasions. The text is taken from , speaking of a thoughtful and blessing God. The passage includes in verse 14: [...] "The Lord shall increase you more and more, you and your children". Many commentators, from his biographer Philipp Spitta onwards, have concluded that the cantata was written <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>wedding.</b> They have proposed weddings where it might have been performed, including Bach's own in October 1707, when he married his first wife Maria Barbara in Dornheim. The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr and others suggest that the cantata may have been written for the wedding of the minister Johann Lorenz Stauber, who had conducted the wedding ceremony for Bach, and Regina Wedemann, an aunt of Maria Barbara, in Dornheim on 5 June 1708. However, the wedding hypothesis is not proven, and the general text could fit other occasions.|$|E

500|$|Folk {{tradition}} {{has it that}} Bajo first left Piva for Drobnjaci, and eventually Drobnjaci for Morača. Bajo was originally engaged to Milica, daughter of a local knez Bogdan Papović from Kazanci. Bogdan was, however, pressured by the recently appointed Pasha of Gacko to hand his daughter to him. Pasha, originally Tepavčević, was taken through devshirme, islamized, educated and served in Constantinople and Travnik. They arranged for a meeting on which Milica was supposed to break the engagement, and choose Pasha instead of Bajo. Bajo, who prepared himself <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>wedding,</b> came to the meeting, and after questioning the girl about her choice, asked for his ring back. Milica handed it to him, at which moment Bajo killed her as well as Pasha {{and two of his}} bodyguards. Knez Bogdan took shelter in his house, which Bajo burned, together with a mosque Pasha erected not long ago, killing with his kinsmen and grooms all the Ottomans who served the Pasha in the process. This action caused him to abandon his tribe, losing all his wealth, and relocate to Drobnjaci, where he planned to lay low for a certain amount of time. There, he presented himself as Spasoje Sokolović, and found a job as an employee of Knez Tomić. [...] Since it was the mowing part of the year, Hasan-Aga Kopčić ordered all of the local knez's to send him their workforces to Bukovica. Bajo was among these people, and he broke his mowing blade [...] one day while working. Taking a break to fix it, he enraged the Agha, who started hiting him with a whip. Bajo then decapitated him with his fixed blade, took his horse and weapons and ran to Morača, which at the time was hajduk's nest and the most defiant of all the Montenegrin Highland tribes towards Ottomans. Bajo lived in Morača for several years, his exploits from this period (like the killing of Hafiz-bey, saving his sister Jela from Muslim maruders and protecting his cousin Sekula from wealthy and vain Pejović family) are preserved in collective memory of the population of North Montenegro. Morača was razed by the Ottomans sometime in the late 1640's, after which Bajo took shelter in Venetian controlled territories.|$|E
