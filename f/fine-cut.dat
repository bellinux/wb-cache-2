40|$|This paper takes a {{close look}} at the salient aspects {{considered}} when building or refurbishing suburban housing. Although very often there is no <b>fine-cutting</b> line between the urban and suburban context, the architectural design, its scale, height and form of each development often indicate the suburb or its boundaries where such a project has taken place. This paper reviews standing legislation and financial incentives provided by EU member states, represented in this COST action. The countries represented include Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden and Turkey. The paper highlights different approaches and strategies taken by different European govern-ments and municipalities towards improving the overall quality of the built environment, par-ticularly in the suburban building stock, namely private and public social housing. Since TU 0701 is scheduled to last for the standard four year duration for a COST action (2007 - 2011), this paper is being presented as the work output of WG 3 at the milestone Mid-Term Conference held in May 2010 in Malta. Although the scientific programme was based on a se-quence of six specific tasks, three of these were completed on time by this date. These are re-ported in the mid-term publication, with each workgroup’s output detailed though technical papers in respective chapters...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince the 1980 s, ‘‘strange'' microwear traces {{were found}} to occur on flint blades from sites in the Near East from the late Neolithic and {{occurring}} in great abundance by the Early Bronze Age. Although these were considered by archaeologists to be sickles because they had visible gloss on their edges, their use-traces could not be reproduced in harvesting experiments {{carried out in the}} field. Subsequently, several lines of evidence were used to study the blades, including not only direct observation of microscopic wear traces, but also Near Eastern cuneiform texts from the third and second millennium BC describing agricultural instruments and analogy with ethnographic and experimental reference material. We found that these tools and their traces best matched traces on flint used to arm the underside of a tribulum (threshing sledge) for threshing grain and cutting straw. We built a replica of the tribulum described in cuneiform texts from the Bronze Age, using copies of the Bronze Age blades, and used this instrument in experiments. The publication of S. A. Semenov's work concerning traceology of ancient implements [S. A. Semenov, Prehistoric Technology (M. W. Thompson, Trans.), Cory, Adams and Mackay, London, 1964] awakened considerable interest in the possibilities of directly inferring tool function from the microscopic traces left by use on ancient implements. However, the goal and purpose of microwear studies is to reconstruct, as completely as possible, the economic activities of prehistoric groups, requiring a methodology that embraces all aspects relevant to the interpretation of microwear traces [L. Keeley, The methodology of microwear analysis : a comment on Nance. American Antiquity 39 (1974) 126 - 128]. In this study, we apply the science of tribology, which studies the friction and the wear of solid bodies in contact, to the threshing sledge and its blades. Tribological analysis of the tribulum has thus far provided new explanations for the formation of traces of wear on flint inserts in threshing sledges, while also revealing features on a far smaller scale, involving the role of a film deposit. We determine the mechanisms by which the tribulum threshes grain, and, particularly, <b>fine-cuts</b> straw from the sheaves of cereal laid on the threshing floor. The superior functioning of the tribulum compared to other methods of threshing and cutting straw is due to its great control of the rheologyethe deformation and floweof the straw layer on the threshing floor. The study lead to insights as to the mastery, of what may be considered today to be complex tribological principles, in the Bronze Age and probably beginning in the Late Neolithic [P. C. Anderson, Observations on the threshing sledge and its products in ancient and present-day Mesopotamia, in: P. C. Anderson, L. S. Cummings, T. K. Schippers, B.

6000|$|There was {{a little}} more {{interest}} taken in the misfortune of an old purblind German and his son, who were found by the conductor to be a few hundred miles out of the direct course to their destination, and were with some trouble and the aid of an Americanized fellow-countryman made aware of the fact. The old man then fell back in the prevailing apathy, and the child naturally cared nothing. By and by came the unsparing train-boy on his rounds, bestrewing the passengers successively with papers, magazines, <b>fine-cut</b> tobacco, and packages of candy. He gave the old man a package of candy, and passed on. The German took it as the bounty of the American people, oddly manifested in a situation where he could otherwise have had little proof of their care. He opened it and was sharing it with his son when the train-boy came back, and metallically, like a part of the machinery, demanded, [...] "Ten cents!"

When it had passed through the alien's head that he was to pay for this national gift and he took with his tremulous fingers from the recesses of his pocket-book a ten-cent note and handed it to his tormentor, some of the people laughed.

5000|$|Fine hooking, in general, uses {{strips of}} wool {{measuring}} 1/32 to 5/32 {{of an inch}} wide. Designs of the <b>fine-cut</b> hooking genre use more fine shading accomplished by overdyeing wool in graduated color swatches. Primitive (or wide-cut) hooking uses wool strips measuring 6/32 up to 1/2-inch wide. The wide-cut hooking accomplishes shading and highlights using textures in wool, such as plaids, checks, herringbones, etc. Wide-cut designs are generally less detailed and mimic the naivety of rug hookers of the past. There are many well-known designers of commercial rug patterns and each exhibit their own distinct style and techniques. Some designers specialize in animals or whimsical subjects, others use specific and identifiable dyeing techniques, while others adapt antique rugs for today's rug hookers or employ various tools to achieve their chosen subject matter within their designs. In addition to the many commercially available patterns, many rug hookers are creating their own design patterns.
