500|$|The tax-driven {{nature of}} {{investment}} in the sector made it vulnerable to policy changes and court rulings interpreting tax law. Tax law reforms in the late 1990s resulting from a major review of tax policy (called the Ralph review) altered {{the way in which}} deductions could be claimed.

2500|$|In {{the days}} of {{charcoal}} iron production in England, most woods in ironmaking regions were managed as coppices, usually being cut on a cycle of about 16 years. In this way, fuel could be provided for that industry, in principle indefinitely, {{as long as the}} nutrient mineral content of the soil was appropriately maintained. This was regulated by a statute of 1544 [...] of Henry VIII, which required woods to be enclosed after cutting (to prevent browsing by animals) and 12 standels (standards or mature uncut trees) to be left in each acre, to be grown into timber. Coppice with standards (scattered individual stems allowed to grow on through several coppice cycles) has been commonly used throughout most of Europe as a means of giving greater flexibility in the resulting <b>forest</b> <b>product</b> from any one area. The woodland provides not only the small material from the coppice but also a range of larger timber for jobs like house building, bridge repair, cart-making and so on.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Historically the {{national}} market for <b>forest</b> <b>products</b> has greatly influenced {{the economies of}} Oregon and its regions {{because of the high}} dependence of these economies on the <b>forest</b> <b>products</b> industry. With the possibility of decreased timber production in the area and the high probability of increasing demand for <b>forest</b> <b>products</b> the economies of Oregon and its regions may in the future be limited by timber harvest rather than {{the national}} market. In this case a change in the amount of timber harvested in a region is the direct cause of a change in <b>forest</b> <b>products</b> industry production and employment, resulting in a corresponding change to the entire regional economy, This study identifies the importance of the <b>forest</b> <b>products</b> industry to the regional economies of Oregon in recent years. Relationships between regional timber harvest and <b>forest</b> <b>products</b> industry employment are identified, which are of some use in predicting employment changes due to changes in timber harvest, when harvest rather than the market is limiting industry production. Finally, employment impact multipliers are derived which can be used to obtain rough estimates of changes in total regional employment in response to changes in basic <b>forest</b> <b>products</b> industry employment...|$|R
