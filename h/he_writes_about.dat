25|$|Tacitus's {{writings}} {{are known}} for their dense prose that seldom glosses the facts, in contrast to the style of some of his contemporaries, such as Plutarch.

25|$|His final preoccupation is {{over the}} precise date of Easter, which <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> at length.

[...] Prime Minister of Sweden Fredrik Reinfeldt said he was ”happy and proud” at the news of Tranströmer's achievement. Meanwhile, international response to the award has been mixed.

25|$|According to Zosimus, Dexippus won an {{important}} victory near the Nessos (Mesta River), on {{the boundary between}} the Roman province of Macedonia and Thrace, the Dalmatian cavalry of the Roman army earning a reputation as good fighters. Reported barbarian casualties were 3,000 men. <b>He</b> <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> the Battle of Naissus by a Roman army led by Claudius advancing from the north. The battle most likely took place in 269, and was fiercely contested. Large numbers on both sides were killed but, at the critical point, the Romans tricked the Goths into an ambush by pretended flight. Around 50,000Goths were allegedly killed or taken captive and their base at Thessalonika destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Singer's {{ideas have}} contributed to the rise of {{effective}} altruism. He argues that people should not only try to reduce suffering, but reduce it in the most effective manner possible. While Singer has previously written at length about the moral imperative to reduce poverty and eliminate the suffering of nonhuman animals, particularly in the meat industry, <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> how the effective altruism movement is doing these things more effectively in his 2015 book, The Most Good You Can Do.

25|$|Pages of {{the memoir}} {{are devoted to}} {{descriptions}} of activities such as music, dance, and song (which was used to keep time in their ocean paddling); hospitality and gift-giving (the famous potlatch); their customs around sex, cleanliness, illness, healing, and death; system of government and punishments; religious beliefs and ceremonies (including {{the treatment of the}} parents of twins); and even the manner of sitting and eating. Other tribes, often tributaries, are listed, described, and their warriors numbered; Jewitt's transliteration does not always match modern renderings of the names. Jewitt mentions the class structure and says that women were excluded from most feasting. Women in general were very modest, but female slaves were used for sex. Jewitt describes their methods of fishing, trapping bears, and trading (including slave trading). <b>He</b> <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> their weapons, and how they made and managed their huge canoes. Jewitt introduced a new sort of harpoon, enabling more successful whale hunts, and various other weapons and implements that Maquinna reserved to himself as king.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Kooman is {{an author}} and playwright. All of Kooman's {{writings}} focus on justice {{and many of the}} issues <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> are gender-based. Kooman's first literary reaction to human trafficking was to write some short stories. Eventually, he also started writing the play that became She Has a Name in order to bring attention to the issue of human trafficking, specifically in its connections to sexual exploitation. In 2009, the script of She Has a Name was given the Scripts At Work/Alberta Playwrights Network Award. By February 2012, Kooman was working on a screenplay version of She Has a Name in order to expose it to a larger audience. Some Americans expressed an interest in staging She Has a Name in the United States. After starting to write this play, Kooman read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident in a Canadian newspaper and also heard about it through a friend of his who was working at an aftercare centre in Bangkok, Thailand to restore the dignity of former sex workers. Knowing that many of the impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play. There was a tour of She Has a Name in 2012, and the final performances were held in Red Deer. Kooman was glad to have the tour conclude in his hometown because the people of Central Alberta were very supportive of the play. During the tour, Kooman was awarded the Outstanding Alumnus Provincial Award Celebrating Excellence (PACE) by the Alberta Association of Colleges & Technical Institutes (AACTI) and the Alberta Ministry of Enterprise. In conjunction with this award, a $5000 scholarship was set up in Kooman's name, which he chose to have awarded to students who evince creativity, leadership, and a commitment to those who are in need. The PACE Award ceremony is biennial, and took place on June 13 in Edmonton at the AACTI Board of Governors Conference.|$|E

500|$|According to the Gesta Hungarorum, [...] "a great host of Muslims" [...] {{arrived in}} Hungary [...] "from {{the land of}} Bular" [...] under Taksony. The {{contemporaneous}} Abraham ben Jacob also recorded the presence of Muslim merchants from Hungary in Prague in 965. Anonymous also writes of the arrival of Pechenegs during Taksony's reign; he granted them [...] "a land to dwell {{in the region of}} Kemej as far as the Tisza". The only sign of a Hungarian connection with Western Europe under Taksony is a report by Liudprand of Cremona. <b>He</b> <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> Zacheus, whom Pope John XII consecrated bishop and [...] "sent to the Hungarians in order to preach that they should attack" [...] the Germans in 963. However, {{there is no evidence that}} Zacheus ever arrived in Hungary. Taksony arranged the marriage of his elder son Géza to Sarolt, daughter of Gyula of Transylvania, before his death during the early 970s.|$|E
500|$|In Gender Advertisements, <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> how {{gender is}} {{represented}} in the advertising we all absorb in our everyday lives. [...] He explains relative size, feminine touch, function ranking, the family, the ritualization of subordination, and licensed withdraw. [...] Relative size means that the women represented in advertisements are generally shown shorter or smaller in comparison to men. [...] Feminine touch is when a woman touches a man or an object {{in a way that}} is very loose, and not gripping the object tightly. [...] Function ranking represents a hierarchy in the images, by way that the man is shown in front and largest in front of women and children. [...] The family is typically depicted in a way that gives the father and a son a close relationship, and the mother and a daughter a close relationship. [...] The ritualization of subordination is when women are shown in a lower ranking or worth of an image, and they are smaller, underneath, and overall of lesser importance to men. [...] Finally, licensed withdrawal is when a women is shown as not interested in the camera, or looking off into the distance with head and body cant. Goffman analyzes all of these topics in a very in-depth and easy to understand format.|$|E
