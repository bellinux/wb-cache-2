The procedure is termed T-SLAM to emphasize the integration of Topological and local <b>Geometric</b> <b>maps</b> that are created using a SLAM algorithm. The topological and metric representations are created independently, being local metric maps associated with topological places and registered at the topological level.

40|$|Traditionally, two {{distinct}} approaches {{have dominated the}} robot mapping literature: topological mapping and <b>geometric</b> <b>mapping.</b> A topological map is an abstract encoding of the structural characteristics of an environment. Often, topological maps represent the environment {{as a set of}} “distinctive places ” (e. g., rooms), connected by sequences of robot behaviors (e. g., hall-following). A geometric map, on the other hand, is a representation of the precise geometric characteristics of the environment, much like a floorplan. Typical approaches to acquiring geometric maps rely heavily on probabilistic techniques due to inherent uncertainties in geometric measurements. Recently, probabilistic methods for topological mapping have also begun to appear, and the mapping literature has moved in some sense toward a confluence of topological and geometric techniques in which the strengths of both approaches can be exploited. This mini-survey examines the convergence of topological and <b>geometric</b> <b>mapping</b> techniques by highlighting several important works in the literature that signify the trend. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} create topological <b>maps</b> from <b>geometric</b> <b>maps</b> obtained with a mobile robot in an indoor-environment using range data. Our approach utilizes AdaBoost, a supervised learning algorithm, to classify each point of the <b>geometric</b> <b>map</b> into semantic classes. We then apply a segmentation procedure based on probabilistic relaxation labeling on the resulting classifications to eliminate errors. The topological graph is then extracted from the individual different regions and their connections. In this way, we obtain a topological map {{in the form of}} a graph, in which each node indicates a region in the environment with its corresponding semantic class (e. g., corridor, or room) and the edges indicate the connections between them. Experimental results obtained with data from different real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. I...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{the application of a}} self-organizing network to the robot which learns to recognize rooms (enclosures) using behavior sequences. In robotics research, most studies on recognizing environments have tried to build the precise <b>geometric</b> <b>map</b> with high sensitive sensors. However many natural agents like animals recognize the environments with low sensitive sensors, and a <b>geometric</b> <b>map</b> may not be necessary. Thus we attempt to build a mobile robot using a self-organizing network to recognize the enclosures, in which it acts, with low sensitive and local sensors. The mobile robot is behavior-based and does wall-following in an enclosure. Then the sequences of behaviors executed in each enclosure are obtained. The sequences are transformed into real-value vectors, and inputted to the Kohonen's self-organizing network. Unsupervised-learning is done and a mobile robot becomes able to distinguish and identify enclosures. We fully implemented the system using a [...] ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{class of}} lattices we are {{interested}} in (subprojective lattices), can be gotten by taking the MacNeille completions of the class of complemented, modular, atomic lattices. McLaughlin showed that subprojective lattices can be represented as the lattices of W-closed subspaces of a vector space U in duality with a vector space W. In this paper, we give a characterization of subprojective lattices in terms of atoms and dual atoms, by means of an incidence space satisfying self-dual axioms. In the finite-dimensional case, a subprojective lattice is projective, and hence our self-dual axioms characterize finite-dimensional projective spaces in terms of points and hyperplanes. No numerical parameters appear explicitly in these axioms. For each subprojective lattice L with at least three elements, we define a projective envelope P(L) for it. P(L) is a projective lattice and there is a natural inf-preserving injection of L into P(L). This injection has other important properties which we take as the definition of a <b>geometric</b> <b>map.</b> In the course of studying <b>geometric</b> <b>maps,</b> we obtain a lattice theoretic proof of Mackey's result that the join of a U-closed subspace of V and a finite-dimensional subspace is U-closed, where (U, V) form a dual pair of vector spaces over a division ring. Furthermore, we show that if L is a subprojective lattice, P a projective lattice, and ψ: L → P a <b>geometric</b> <b>map,</b> then P is isomorphic to the projective envelope P(L) of L. The paper presents many other properties of subprojective lattices. It concludes with a characterization of subprojective lattices which are also projective...|$|R

40|$|Preschool {{children}} can navigate by simple <b>geometric</b> <b>maps</b> of the environment, but {{the nature of}} the geomet-ric relations they use in map reading remains unclear. Here, children were tested specifically on their sensitiv-ity to angle. Forty-eight children (age 47 : 15 – 53 : 30 months) were presented with fragments of <b>geometric</b> <b>maps,</b> in which angle sections appeared without any relevant length or distance information. Children were able to read these map fragments and compare two-dimensional to three-dimensional angles. However, this ability appeared both variable and fragile among the youngest children of the sample. These findings suggest that 4 -year-old children begin to form an abstract concept of angle that applies both to two-dimsional and three-dimensional displays and that serves to interpret novel spatial symbols. Geometry defines abstract concepts that apply to various types of spatial entities. For example, we may find angles in two-dimensional line drawings, in the contours of three-dimensional objects, in the arrangement of the walls surrounding us, or even in the projections of star patterns in the sky. Simi-larly, in geometry the length of an object and th...|$|R
