40|$|We {{describe}} {{the evaluation of}} the registration of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans with X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the human brain. A CT scan and a PET scan of the same person were obtained with <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> placed on the person 2 ̆ 7 s head. The CT scan and the PET scan were then registered, first by using the <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers,</b> and next by applying the registration method currently under question, completely ignoring <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers.</b> In both cases, the positions of <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> in PET scan and the positions of corresponding <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> in CT scan were compared. The results based on aligning only one patient scans are encouraging, and in the future we hope to obtain more PET and CT scan pairs to validate the registration method...|$|R
30|$|Here, we {{introduce}} a simple experimental protocol to distribute <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> {{in three dimensions}} using a hydrophilic extracellular matrix (ECM). Such hydrogels were developed for cell culture to support cell growth in 3 D {{and serve as a}} scaffold (Lee et al. 2008), and comprise biocompatible compounds such as fibrin (Blomback 2004 # 212), collagen (Bell et al. 1979) or alginate (Augst et al. 2006). Adding <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> to the ECM gel and embedding the cells in the gel matrix leads to a distribution of the <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> in 3 D. We perform single-molecule localization microscopy of DNA and histone H 2 B in different axial planes, and use the <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> to correct for both drift and spectral offset. A sufficiently dense distribution of <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> further allows registering super-resolution images recorded in different axial planes.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Implanted <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> {{are often}} used in {{radiotherapy}} to facilitate accurate visualization and localization of tumors.

The normalized cross-correlation was the used to identify <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> in projection images.

30|$|We {{introduce}} a hydrophilic gel matrix for single-molecule super-resolution microscopy. This matrix matches {{the index of}} refraction of aqueous buffers (1.34), and is compatible with photoswitching of synthetic fluorophores in appropriate switching buffers. We demonstrate that single-molecule super-resolution microscopy can be performed in the ECM gel, and that <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> {{can be added to}} the ECM gel prior to sample embedding. These <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> are distributed in 3 D in the gel matrix, and can be used to correct for drift and image registration. The <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> can be used for imaging away from the cover glass. In addition, this approach allows registration of images recorded in different axial planes, making use of <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> that were recorded in multiple planes. In the future, this approach can be combined with a light sheet illumination scheme and a piezo-driven scanning mode, to allow for automated whole-cell imaging in 3 D.|$|R
30|$|Single-molecule {{localization}} {{data was}} analyzed with rapid STORM (Wolter et al., 2010) or the N-STORM software (STORM plugin, NIS, Nikon). As the <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> {{are found in}} {{a large number of}} frames, we obtain the coordinates of the markers over time, which we want to call trajectory. The trajectories of <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> were extracted using either the “track emission” filter of rapid STORM or custom-written software.|$|R
30|$|For the {{generation}} of a 3 D super-resolution image from two 3 D sections, we selected <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> in the overlapping space between both planes (300 nm) (Additional file 6 : Figure S 6). This resulted in a 3 D image with an axial range of 1.7 μm. The acquisition of more 3 D sections will further increase the axial range, and whole cells can be visualized. The quality of drift correction and image registration is visualized by 3 <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> at the upper right of the image (Figure  4 a, d and Additional file 6 : Figure S 6).

40|$|AbstractPurposeRobotic {{stereotactic}} body {{radiation therapy}} (SBRT) {{for the treatment}} of hepatocellular carcinoma requires the perilesional implant of gold <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> for detection by scopy. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether the implant of gold <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> is still possible and, if so, with which imaging technique and with what results. Materials and methodsThis is a prospective study based on the implant of <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> in the liver in our department for a treatment by SBRT for a hepatocellular carcinoma in 38 patients (49 lesions to treat) over a period of one year. As the first choice, it consisted of sonographic guidance and, if not possible, CT-scan guidance was used. ResultsThe mean number of <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> implanted per procedure was 2. 68 (± 0. 61) with almost exclusive sonographic guidance (36 out of 38 patients or 95 % of the patients). The mean distance between the markers and the lesion was 32 mm (± 11 mm) and that between the markers was 17 mm (± 7 mm). ConclusionSBRT is being evaluated {{for the treatment of}} liver lesions. The radiologist has an important role to play since the implant of <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> in the liver is indispensable. It is almost always possible with sonographic guidance, including for lesions not accessible to microbiopsies, a treatment by radiofrequency or for lesions poorly individualisable by sonography or CT-scan...|$|R
30|$|To first {{demonstrate}} {{drift correction}} we prepared {{a sample of}} <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> immobilized on a glass surface, which was imaged under normal conditions and showed {{a high level of}} non-linear drift (an exemplary trajectory is shown in Additional file 2 : Figure S 2 a). From the coordinates of the <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> over time, trajectories were generated which contained information on the movement of the markers. These trajectories were split into spatial dimensions (Additional file 2 : Figure S 2 b) and were convolved with a Gaussian low pass filter (Additional file 2 : Figure S 2 c and S 2 d). From these trajectories, an affine transfer matrix was calculated for each frame and applied to the uncorrected coordinates of <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> (Additional file 2 : Figure S 2 e). In a second experiment, we embedded <b>fiducial</b> <b>markers</b> in the gel matrix in 3 D.

50|$|Fiducial markers {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of medical imaging applications. Images of the same subject {{produced}} with two different imaging systems may be correlated by placing a <b>fiducial</b> <b>marker</b> in the area imaged by both systems. In this case, a marker which is visible in the images produced by both imaging modalities must be used. By this method, functional information from SPECT or positron emission tomography can be related to anatomical information provided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Similarly, fiducial points established during MRI can be correlated with brain images generated by magnetoencephalography to localize the source of brain activity. Such fiducial points or markers are often created in tomographic images such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography images using a device known as the N-localizer.|$|E

40|$|Background: CyberKnife {{radiation}} therapy has a widely used {{system in the}} treatment of extracranial lesions. Implanting gold fiducial markers around a tumor is an important procedure for the planning and aiming of CyberKnife {{radiation therapy}}. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of percutaneous <b>fiducial</b> <b>marker</b> implantation of hepatic malignancies under sonographic guidance for CyberKnife radiation therapy. Materials and Methods: From April 2009 to November 2011, we retrospectively reviewed 30 percutaneous <b>fiducial</b> <b>marker</b> implantations in 30 patients with hepatic tumors. All patients underwent percutaneous <b>fiducial</b> <b>marker</b> implantation under sonographic guidance. The feasibility, safety, and efficacy of this technique were analyzed on immediate follow-up unenhanced computed tomography (CT) and 1 -week follow-up contrast-enhanced CT. The efficacy of this technique was defined as implantation enabling adequate treatment planning and CT simulation. Results: All 30 patients (100 %) had successful <b>fiducial</b> <b>marker</b> implantation under sonographic guidance. The mean number of fiducial markers implanted per patient was 4. 30 (range: 4 - 6 seeds). There was one minor complication (3. 33 %, 1 / 30). All 30 patients successfully underwent CyberKnife radiation therapy after <b>fiducial</b> <b>marker</b> implantation.

40|$|Automatic alignment, {{especially}} fiducial marker-based alignment, {{has become}} increasingly important due to the high demand of subtomogram averaging and the rapid development of large-field electron microscopy. Among the alignment steps, <b>fiducial</b> <b>marker</b> tracking is a crucial one that determines {{the quality of the}} final alignment. Yet, it is still a challenging problem to track the fiducial markers accurately and effectively in a fully automatic manner. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient scheme for <b>fiducial</b> <b>marker</b> tracking. Firstly, we theoretically prove the upper bound of the transformation deviation of aligning the positions of fiducial markers on two micrographs by affine transformation. Secondly, we design an automatic algorithm based on the Gaussian mixture model to accelerate the procedure of <b>fiducial</b> <b>marker</b> tracking. Thirdly, we propose a divide-and-conquer strategy against lens distortions to ensure the reliability of our scheme. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt that theoretically relates the projection model with the tracking model. The real-world experimental results further support our theoretical bound and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

40|$|Purpose: We {{investigated}} the accuracy and feasibility {{of a system}} that provides transrectal needle access to the prostate concurrent with 1. 5 Tesla MRI which previously has not been possible. Materials and Methods: In 5 patients with previously diagnosed prostate cancer, MRI guided intraprostatic placement of gold fiducial markers (4 procedures) and/or prostate biopsy (3 procedures) was performed using local anesthesia. Results: Mean procedure duration was 76 minutes and all patients tolerated the intervention well. Procedure related adverse events included self-limited hematuria and hematochezia following 3 of 8 procedures (all resolved in less than 1 week). Mean needle placement accuracy was 1. 9 mm for the <b>fiducial</b> <b>marker</b> placement studies and 1. 8 mm for the biopsy procedures. Mean <b>fiducial</b> <b>marker</b> placement accuracy was 4. 8 mm and the mean <b>fiducial</b> <b>marker</b> placement accuracy transverse to the needle direction was 2. 6 mm. All patients who underwent the procedure were able to complete their course of radiotherapy without delay or complication. Conclusions: While studies of clinical usefulness are warranted, transrectal 1. 5 T MRI guided prostate biopsy and <b>fiducial</b> <b>marker</b> placement is feasible using this system, providing new opportunities for image guided diagnostic and therapeutic prostate interventions.
