Two different kinds of motions are used for determining the <b>dynamic</b> yaw <b>stability</b> derivatives CNr and CNbeta. Concerning the first one, simple lateral translation and yaw rotary motions in yaw are considered. The second one consists of combined motions. To determine <b>dynamic</b> yaw <b>stability</b> derivatives of the bird, the simulation of an unsteady flow with a bird model showing a harmonic motion is performed. The unsteady flow solution for each time step is obtained by solving unsteady Euler equations based on a finite volume approach for a smaller reduced frequency.

The results on the <b>dynamic</b> yaw <b>stability</b> derivatives for both simulations of the model motion show a good agreement.

40|$|M. Lawson 2 ̆ 6 A. Webster College of St. Benedict, St. Joseph, MN Introduction: <b>Dynamic</b> {{postural}} <b>stability</b> is {{the ability}} to maintain stability when transitioning from a dynamic to static state. <b>Dynamic</b> postural <b>stability</b> can be measured using the <b>Dynamic</b> Postural <b>Stability</b> Index (DPSI), which is calculated using its directional components Anterior-Posterior Stability Index (APSI), Medial-Lateral Stability Index (MLSI), and Vertical Stability Index (VSI). With evidence that ankle bracing can enhance ankle proprioception, ankle bracing may enhance performance during DPSI testing because dynamic balance relies on proprioception and somatosensory feedback. Purpose: Because prophylactic ankle bracing is common in sport and exercise, {{it is important to understand}} how it may impact <b>dynamic</b> postural <b>stability.</b> The purpose of this study is to determine if prophylactic ankle braces have an effect on DPSI values.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the effect of soft (SB) and semi-rigid (SRB) ankle braces on static and <b>dynamic</b> postural <b>stability</b> in healthy young men. Altogether, 21 male adults (mean age 24. 0 ± 1. 5 years) were assessed for one leg while wearing non-brace (NB), SB or SRB. Balance in single-limb stance on a single-force platform with open eyes and closed eyes were assessed for the non-dominant leg under SB, SRB, and NB conditions. Locus length/second (mm/s) and the enveloped area (mm·s- 2) surrounded by the circumference of the wave pattern during postural sway were calculated. For assessing <b>dynamic</b> postural <b>stability,</b> the participant jumped and landed on one leg on a force platform, and the <b>Dynamic</b> Postural <b>Stability</b> Index (DPSI) and the maximum vertical ground reaction force (vGRFmax) were measured.

The correlations between locus length/second, enveloped area, DPSI values (DPSI, Anterior-Posterior Stability Index, Medial-Lateral Stability Index, and Vertical Stability Index), and vGRFmax were then calculated. The results indicated that locus length/second and enveloped area with open eyes and closed eyes were not significantly different for each condition. However, a significant lower in the DPSI and Vertical Stability Index were observed with the SRB in comparison to the SB and NB. A significant improvement in vGRFmax was also observed with the SRB in comparison to NB.
