5|$|At the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Irvine, California, the Brazilian {{started by}} winning a {{gold in the}} 50-metre butterfly, beating the {{championship}} record. He hoped to also win gold in the 50-metre and 100-metre freestyle, but settled for silver in the 50-metre freestyle, and bronze in the 100-metre freestyle. When interviewed after the contest, Cielo said there could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> flaw in his training program, resulting in a lack of stamina.|$|E

5|$|Deal Castle {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a military fortification throughout the 18th century, and in 1728 it was equipped with 11 culverin guns. The following year, however, the captain, naval officer Sir John Norris, redeveloped the castle to improve his personal accommodation. Similar work had been carried out at Walmer in 1708 by the Duke of Dorset, Lionel Sackville, and there may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> competition between the two men. The keep was redesigned with medieval-style battlements, and wood-panelled accommodation at the rear overlooking the sea; the porter's lodge was also updated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} before the Norman Conquest, Somerset {{came under the}} control of Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and his family. There seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> Danish {{settlement}} at Thurloxton and Spaxton, judging from the place-names. After the Norman Conquest, the county was divided into 700 fiefs, and large areas were owned by the crown, with fortifications such as Dunster Castle used for control and defence.|$|E
5|$|The Venusian {{surface was}} {{a subject of}} {{speculation}} until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary science in the 20th century. Venera landers in 1975 and 1982 returned images of a surface covered in sediment and relatively angular rocks. The surface was mapped in detail by Magellan in 1990–91. The ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism, and the sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate that there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> recent eruptions.|$|E

5|$|The {{total size}} of the Roman {{garrison}} in Scotland during the Flavian period of occupation is thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> 25,000 troops, requiring 16–19,000 tons of grain per annum. In addition, the material to construct the forts was substantial, estimated at 1 million cubic feet (28,315m3) of timber during the 1st century. Ten tons of buried nails were discovered at the Inchtuthil site, which {{may have had a}} garrison of up to 6,000 men and which itself consumed 30linear kilometres of wood for the walls alone, which would have used up 100hectares (247acres) of forest.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the schools}} {{do not share}} {{geographic}} proximity, which would induce frequent recruiting battles, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> high-profile recruits that were heavily targeted by both institutions. Chris Webber, Michigan's Mr. Basketball in 1991 and the National High School player of the year, chose Michigan over Duke and eventually became the #1 pick in the 1993 NBA Draft after playing two seasons for the Wolverines. Duke returned the favor by gaining a commitment from Michigan-raised Detroit Country Day alum Shane Battier, the 1997 Mr. Basketball of Michigan, who led Duke's 2001 National Championship team, while sweeping all of the National Player of the Year awards. Battier had {{been a fan of}} the Fab Five growing up. More recently, Michigan landed Mitch McGary, who had visited only Michigan, Duke and University of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|As discussed, the Chalkidian League {{had made}} peace with Athens in 352 BC, in clear breach of their {{alliance}} with Philip, due to their growing fear of Macedonian power. Cawkwell contends that from that moment on, Olynthos and the League were doomed. However, {{the next few years}} of Philip's reign appear to have been militarily quiet; Diodorus does not mention any activity by Philip until 349 BC. Philip did not yet make any further efforts to intervene in the Sacred War, which was to rumble on until 346 BC. In the meantime, there may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> unrest in Macedonia; Philip executed one of his stepbrothers (sons of Amyntas III's second wife), and two more fled to Olynthos. According to Justin, this provided Philip with the pretext of attacking Olynthos and the Chalkidian League.|$|E

5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating calendar, the Maya {{measured}} time from a fixed start point. The Maya set {{the beginning of}} their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of bak'tuns, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak'tuns. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an exceptional cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} {{security}} after the 2016 election, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> detentions and arrests {{that have been}} related to the increased security at the tower. On December 6, a woman managed to bypass security {{and go to the}} 24th floor—two floors below Donald Trump's office—before being stopped by Secret Service officers. A week later on December 13, a Baruch College student who was arrested at Trump Tower was found to have multiple weapons, including knives, a garrote, and firecrackers. The next day, another man reportedly got angry after he wanted to meet Donald Trump at the tower, and after throwing a wine glass onto the floor of the tower's lobby, was subsequently detained by the NYPD.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{physical}} isolation, the islanders maintained a lively community. A school {{had been established}} in 1723 by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SPCK), with sixty children on its initial attendance roll. The demands of island life conflicted to some extent with those of schooling. The SPCK's inspector found only eighteen out of seventy pupils present when he visited in 1824. He found {{that many of the}} children were fully occupied helping their families in summer and only attended school in winter. Two places of worship were built within a couple of years of each other, a Baptist chapel in 1877 and a Church of Scotland church in 1878 (at a cost of £900). Although they soon became focal elements of community life, there seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> bad blood between the two congregations, perhaps due to a clash between the missionary zeal of local Baptists and the Calvinism of the Presbyterian Kirk.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{people could}} {{do little to}} protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} eating the insects may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt {{the development of the}} insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Leggetts Creek {{flows through}} a water gap known as Leggetts Gap or The Notch. The gap is {{cut through the}} West or Lackawanna Mountain Range by the creek. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> culm banks along the creek and {{historic}} mining operations such as those at the Marvine #6 Colliery have affected it. The creek's headwaters are in wetlands surrounded by residential development. There is riprap on the creek in Leggetts Gap as it flows near major highways in this stretch. It typically has a natural channel in part of its lower reaches {{and there are some}} reaches with gradual slopes. However, {{in some parts of the}} creek's lower reaches, fill has been dumped onto its banks, creating steep slopes. The creek has been channelized in South Abington Township.|$|E
5|$|Nigel's date {{of birth}} is uncertain, but {{it is likely to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> time around 1100. Historians {{occasionally}} refer to him as Nigel Poor or Nigel of Ely, but before his elevation to the episcopate he was commonly known as Nigel, the bishop's nephew, or Nigel, the treasurer. He was probably a Norman by ancestry although he was brought up in England, which in 1066 had been conquered by the Duke of Normandy, William the Conqueror. Following William's death in 1087 his realm was divided between two of his sons. His middle son, William Rufus, inherited the Kingdom of England, and the Duchy of Normandy passed to his eldest son, Robert Curthose. The youngest son, Henry, received a grant of money, which he used to purchase a lordship in Normandy. The brothers fought amongst themselves for the next twenty years; the initial conflict was between Rufus and Robert, but after Rufus' death in 1100 Henry, who succeeded Rufus as King of England, also became involved. Eventually, in 1106, Henry captured Robert, imprisoned him for life, and took control of Normandy.|$|E

5|$|Over the winter, {{there seems}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> tension between the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not {{protected}} by the isthmus, but whose fleet were {{the key to the}} security of the Peloponnesus, felt hard done by. They demanded an Allied army march north the following year. When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, thus skulked off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos, both sides unwilling to risk battle. Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse {{have little}} {{interaction}} with people, primarily because most species live in arid unpopulated areas and at low densities. They are not generally sought after as game birds {{as they are}} not especially palatable, although they have on occasion been taken in great numbers at water holes. An attempt to introduce them into Nevada failed {{but they have been}} introduced to Hawaii. No species is considered to be threatened although there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> localised range contractions, particularly in Europe. A subspecies of the chestnut-bellied sandgrouse, P. e. floweri, was last seen in the Nile Valley of Egypt in 1979. It is thought to be extinct, but the reasons for this are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The King's School, Canterbury claims Augustine as its founder, {{which would}} make it the world's oldest {{existing}} school, but the first documentary records of the school date from the 16th century. Augustine did establish a school, and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the East Anglian mission. Augustine received liturgical books from the pope, but their exact contents are unknown. They may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> of the new mass books that were being written at this time. The exact liturgy that Augustine introduced to England remains unknown, {{but it would have been}} a form of the Latin language liturgy in use at Rome.|$|E
