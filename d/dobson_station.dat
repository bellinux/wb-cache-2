40|$|Seven {{years of}} TOMS total ozone data are {{currently}} available. Recently a new ozone retrieval algorithm based on improved ozone {{absorption cross section}} was implemented that has introduced 6 - 7 percent discontinuity in the archived data sets {{at the end of}} the fifth year of instrument operation. Until all data are reprocessed with the new algorithm users can use a table of correction factors given in this paper to make the data set internally consistent. This paper also presents a comparison of TOMS results with Amundsen Scott <b>Dobson</b> <b>station.</b> Though the agrement in most years is good, in 1983 - 84 the <b>Dobson</b> <b>station</b> reported unusually high values of ozone while TOMS saw the very low ozone values associated with the Antarctica ozone hole...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the susceptibility of the Dobson spectrophotometer No. 118 to stray light interference. In this regard, {{a series of}} total ozone content measurements were carried out in Athens, Greece for air-mass values (μ) extending up to μ = 5. The monochromatic-heterochromatic stray light derived by Basher's model was used in order to evaluate the specific instrumental parameters which determine if this instrument suffers from this problem or not. The results obtained indicate that the measurements made by the Dobson instrument of the Athens station for air mass values up to 2. 5, underestimates the total ozone content by 3. 5 DU in average, or about 1 % of the station's mean total ozone content (TOC). The comparison {{of the values of}} the same parameters measured 15 years ago with the present ones indicates the good maintenance of the Dobson spectrophotometer No. 118. This fact is of crucial importance because the variability of the daily total ozone observations collected by the Athens <b>Dobson</b> <b>Station</b> since 1989 has proved to be representative to the variability of the mean total ozone observed over the whole mid-latitude zone of the Northern Hemisphere. This stresses the point that the Athens total ozone station, being the unique <b>Dobson</b> <b>station</b> in south-eastern Europe, may be assumed as a ground truth station for the reliable conversion of the satellite radiance observations to total ozone measurements...|$|E
40|$|An {{ultraviolet}} spectrophotometer (UVS) {{to measure}} downward solar fluxes from an aircraft or other high altitude platform is described. The UVS uses an ultraviolet diffuser to obtain large angular response with no aiming requirement, a twelve-position filter wheel with narrow (2 -nm) and broad (20 -nm) bandpass filters, and an ultraviolet photodiode. The columnar atmospheric ozone above the UVS (aircraft) is {{calculated from the}} ratios of the measured ultraviolet fluxes. Comparison with some <b>Dobson</b> <b>station</b> measurements gives agreement to 2 %. Some UVS measured ozone profiles over the Pacific Ocean for November 1976 are shown to illustrate the instrument's performance...|$|E
40|$|Six {{years of}} total ozone data {{derived from the}} Nimbus 7 Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) {{experiment}} are compared with results from 41 <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> to determine year-to-year changes {{in addition to the}} monthly bias change for individual stations and for the network. The SBUV measurements are found to drift against the <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> with a linear trend of. 38 + or -. 13 percent/yr. The cause of the drift could not be separated between residual uncorrected drift in the SBUV instrument, limited sensitivity of the SBUV to increases in tropospheric ozone, and the effect of local increases in pollution level on individual <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Examples of {{comparisons}} of monthly summaries (based on daily measurements) {{of some of}} the regularily operating <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations,</b> with the values deduced from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) overpass are given. Shortcomings in certain <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> are identified, such as: use of an incorrect value for the extraterrestrial constant (HOBART); sudden large volume changes (Brisbane); unusually low Dobson readings (Mauna Loa); and use of inaccurate cloud blue sky charts, causing fictitious differences with direct sun measurements (Toronto) ...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{years of}} total ozone data {{derived from the}} TOMS {{instrument}} on Nimbus- 7 are compared with results from 41 <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations.</b> In this study, a significant improvement in fit from previous studies is obtained using a model which assumes {{a change in the}} rate of drift between TOMS and Dobson around the middle of 1982. Results indicate that the TOMS measurements have drifted relative to the <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> with a two-part linear trend of - 0. 25 + or - 0. 17 percent per year during the period from launch to 6 / 30 / 82, and - 0. 51 + or - 0. 21 percent per year during 7 / 1 / 82 - 10 / 31 / 85. The causes of this drift cannot be definitively separated between residual uncorrected drift in the TOMS instrument (a similar drift is apparent in the SBUV-Dobson comparisons), limited sensitivity of the TOMS to increases in tropospheric ozone, and the effect of local increases in pollution levels on individual <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{ultraviolet}} {{interference filter}} spectrophotometer was modified {{to use a}} photodiode and was flown on latitude survey flights {{in the fall of}} 1976. Comparison with <b>Dobson</b> <b>station</b> total ozone values shows agreement between UVS and Dobson total ozone of + or - 2 percent. The procedure used to convert UVS measured ozone above the aircraft altitude to total ozone above ground level introduces an additional 2 percent deviation for very high altitude UVS ozone data. Under stable aircraft operating conditions, the UVS derived ozone values have a variability, or reproducibility, of better than + or - 1 percent. The UVS data from the latitude survey flights yield a detailed latitude profile of total ozone over the Pacific Ocean during November 1976. Significant latitudinal structure in total ozone is found at the middle latitudes (30 deg to 40 deg N and S) ...|$|E

40|$|Power {{spectrum}} analysis {{has been applied}} to the total ozone time series at each of a sample of <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> with records of more than 15 years in the interval 1957 to 1981. The distributions of strongly periodic or quasiperiodic signals in these spectral estimates, for three spectral estimators and two levels of confidence, show distinct features. These appear at the previously known or suspected periods of 3. 5 - 4. 0 years, 27 months, and 21 months as well as the previously unreported period of 11. 5 months. Possible geophysical implications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Annual {{extremes}} of total column amount of ozone (in the period 1964 - 1988) from {{a network of}} 29 <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> have been examined using the extreme value analysis. The extremes have been calculated as the highest deviation of daily mean total ozone from its long-term monthly mean, normalized by the monthly standard deviations. The extremes have been selected from the direct-Sun total ozone observations only. The extremes resulting from abrupt changes in ozone (day to day changes greater than 20 percent) have not been considered. The ordered extremes (maxima in ascending way, minima in descending way) have been fitted {{to one of three}} forms of the Fisher-Tippet extreme value distribution by the nonlinear least square method (Levenberg-Marguard method). We have found that the ordered extremes from a majority of <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> lie close to Fisher-Tippet type III. The extreme value analysis of the composite annual extremes (combined from averages of the annual extremes selected at individual stations) has shown that the composite maxima are fitted by the Fisher-Tippet type III and the composite minima by the Fisher-Tippet type I. The difference between the Fisher-Tippet types of the composite extremes seems {{to be related to the}} ozone downward trend. Extreme value prognoses for the period 1964 - 2014 (derived from the data taken at: all analyzed stations, the North American, and the European stations) have revealed that the prognostic extremes are close to the largest annual extremes in the period 1964 - 1988 and there are only small regional differences in the prognoses...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, Umkehr data {{taken by}} 20 <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> {{around the world}} have been the {{principal}} source of information about the behavior of upper stratospheric ozone. Umkehr results are used also for detecting drifts in satellite instruments and for determining intersatellite biases. However, a systematic evaluation of the quality of Umkehr data taken by the various stations has been lacking. Five years of ozone profile data from the Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet (SBUV) have been used to examine and intercompare the quality of Umkehr stations, and to assess the degradation of their performance after the El Chichon volcano eruption in southern Mexico. In contrast to Umkehr, the SBUV ozone measurments in layers 7 through 9 (1 - 8 mb) were unaffected by the massive amounts of dust and gases ejected by El Chichon...|$|R
40|$|A recent {{recalibration}} and reprocessing of {{the total}} ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) data have made possible a new determination of the global average total ozone decrease of 3. 5 percent over the 11 -year period, January 1, 1979, to December 31, 1989, with a 2 sigma error of 1. 4 percent. The revised TOMS ozone trend data are in agreement, within error limits, with the average of 39 ground-based <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> and with the world standard Dobson spectrometer 83 at Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Superimposed on the 11 -year ozone trend is a possible solar cycle effect, quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), annual, and semiannual cycles. Using solar 10 - 7 -cm flux data and 30 -mbar Singapore wind data (QBO), a time series has been constructed that reproduces the long-term behavior of the globally averaged ozone. Removal of the apparent solar cycle effect from the global average reduces the net ozone loss to 2. 66 + or - 1. 4 percent per decade. The precise value of the global average ozone trend depends on the latitude range selected, with ranges greater than + or - 69 emphasizing the larger variations at high latitudes...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of the calibration of the Nimbus 7 solar backscatter UV (SBUV) and {{total ozone mapping spectrometer}} (TOMS) instruments by comparing their ozone measurements with those made by a single, very stable Dobson instrument: the world primary standard Dobson spectrometer number 83. Measurements of ozone made with instrument 83 at Mauna Loa observatory in eight summers between 1979 and 1989 were compared with coincident TOMS ozone measurements. The comparison shows that relative to instrument 83, ozone measured by TOMS (and SBUV) was stable between 1979 and approximately 1983, had decreased by 3 percent by 1986, and had decreased by almost 7 percent by 1989. A similar time dependence is seen when data from an ensemble of 39 <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> throughout the world is compared with TOMS over the period 1979 - 1987. The most likely reason for the relative drift is that the diffuser plate used by both SBUV and TOMS to measure solar flux has suffered an uncorrected wavelength-dependent degradation, with most of the degradation occurring after 1983. The recently released version 6 TOMS data, corrected using the internal 'pair justification' technique, show almost no drift relative to Dobson instrument 83. Accurate measurements of long-term global ozone change will require a coherent system incorporating both ground-based and satellite-based ozone measurements...|$|R
40|$|During {{deliberations}} of the International Ozone Trends Panel (IOTP) {{it became}} obvious that satellite determinations of global ozone amounts by themselves could not provide the necessary confidence in the measured trends. During the time of the deliberations of the IOTP, Bojkov re-examined the records of serveral North American <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> and Degorska re-examined the records of the Belsk station. They were able {{to improve the quality of}} the data sets, thus improving the precision of their total ozone data sets. These improvements showed the greater potential of the world-wide Dobson total ozone data set in two primary areas. Firstly, the improvements showed that the existing data set when evaluated will become more valuable for comparisons with satellite determinations of total ozone. Secondly, the Dobson data set covers a greater period of time than the satellite data sets thus offering the possibility of extending improved information on ozone trends further back in time. An International Dobson Workshop was convened in September, 1991, under the auspices of the NOAA Climate and Global Change Program. It was part of the Information Management element of the C&GC Program. Further, it was considered as a 'data archaeology' project under the above. Clearly if the existing Dobson data set can be improved by re-evaluating all data records, we will be able to uncover the 'true' or 'best' data and fulfill the role of archaeologists...|$|R
40|$|Ozone {{measurements}} {{from the}} Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer on the Nimbus 7 satellite are compared with ground-based measurements from five <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> at northern latitudes {{to evaluate the}} accuracy of the TOMS data, particularly in regions north of 50 deg N. The measurements from the individual stations show mean differences from - 2. 5 percent up to plus 8. 3 percent relative to TOMS measurements and two of the ground stations, Oslo and Longyearbyen, show a significant drift of plus 1. 2 percent and plus 3. 7 percent per year, respectively. It can be shown from nearly simultaneous measurements in two different wavelength double pairs at Oslo that at least 2 percent of the differences result from the use of the CC' wavelength double pair instead of the standard AD wavelength double pair. Since all Norwegian stations used the CC' wavelength double pair exclusively a similar error can be assumed for Tromso and Longyearbyren. A comparison between the tropospheric ozone content in TOMS data and from ECC ozonesonde measurements at Ny-Alesund and Bear Island shows that the amount of tropospheric ozone in the standard profiles used in the TOMS algorithm is too low, which leads to an error of about 2 percent in total ozone. Particularly at high solar zenith angles (greater than 80 deg), Dobson measurements become unreliable. They are up to 20 percent lower than TOMS measurements averaged over solar zenith angles of 88 deg to 89 deg...|$|R

Linear drifts are estimated for the differences between SBUV and <b>Dobson</b> ground <b>station</b> total ozone data. The results show an average negative linear drift in SBUV data relative to Dobson data of about - 0. 4 percent per year. The global estimate {{of the relation between}} total ozone and solar flux variations is 0. 97 + or - 0. 61 / 100 solar flux units, representing a change of total ozone over the 7 -year period associated with solar flux variations of about - 0. 20 + or - 0. 13 percent per year...|$|R

40|$|NASA is {{creating}} a long term satellite ozone time series by combining data from multiple instruments: Nimbus 7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) (1978 - 1993), Meteor 3 TOMS (1991 - 1994), Earth Probe TOMS (1996 - present), Nimbus 7 SB-JV (1978 - 1990), NOAA- 9 Solar Backscatter UV Spectrometer (SBUV/ 2) (1984 - 1997), NOAA- 11 SBUV/ 2 (1989 - 1994), and NOAA- 14 SBUV/ 2 (1995 - present). The stability of individual data sets and possible instrument-to-instrument differences are best checked by comparison with ground-based measurements. We have examined the time dependence of the calibrations of these instruments by comparing satellite derived ozone with that measured by the world primary standard Dobson spectrometer No. 83. This instrument has been maintained since 1962 as a standard for total ozone to an uncertainty of plus or minus 0. 5 %. Measurements of AD pair ozone made with instrument No. 83 at Mauna Loa observatory most summers since 1979 were compared with coincident TOMS and SBUV(/ 2) ozone measurements. The comparison shows that the various instruments were stable relative to instrument No. 83 to within about plus or minus 1 %, but that there are instrument-to-instrument biases {{of as much as}} 3 %. Earth Probe TOMS, for example, is 1 % to 2 % high relative to Nimbus 7 TOMS when the world standard instrument is used as a transfer standard. Similar results are seen when comparisons are made with an ensemble of 41 <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> throughout the world, demonstrating that the ensemble as a whole is stable despite the fact that many instruments within the ensemble have clear calibration changes...|$|R

40|$|The daily averages {{of total}} column amount of ozone {{taken in the}} period 1964 - 1988 at a network of 24 <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> have been analyzed. Year-round data as well as summer data (May - Aug.) and winter data (Dec. - March) have been {{examined}} in the following regions: latitude bands (30 deg N - 39 deg N, 40 deg N - 52 deg N, 30 deg N - 60 deg N), North America, Europe, and Japan. To find year-to-year changes {{in the shape of}} the annual statistical distribution of total ozone (ASDTO) for these regions, we analyze trends in the following statistic characteristics of ASDTO: mean, standard deviation, median, and 10 and 90 percentiles. Time series of the statistical characteristics for the selected regions have been combined by averaging the individual stations values of these characteristics. The trends have been calculated by the multiple regression model adjusted for: the 11 -year solar cycle, the Southern Oscillations effects, and for serial correlations. We have found that: a) in all regions (excluding Japan, North America), the shape of ASDTO has been drifting towards low ozone values. The drift seems to be not accompanied with a transformation in the shape of ASDTO. The drift speed (the rate of decrease in the annual means of total ozone) is of order 1 - 3 percent per decade (in the period 1970 - 1988). b) In Japan, the interannual changes in the shape of ASDTO have not been revealed. c) In North America, the drift of the year-round ASDTO (the year-round ASDTO comprises all the daily means of total ozone in a given year) has been accompanied with a transformation in the shape. The shape of the year round ASDTO becomes narrower. d) In all regions, except Japan and the band 30 deg - 39 deg N, the winter ASDTO (the winter ASDTO comprises the data taken in the period December in a given year through March next year) moves faster towards low ozone values than the summer ASDTO (the summer ASDTO comprises the data taken in the period May through August in a given year) ...|$|R
40|$|Total {{ozone data}} {{obtained}} during summers at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, with Dobson Spectrophotometer 83 are routinely compared with overpass total ozone {{data from the}} Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) spectrometer launched aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite in 1978. Results from the TOMS/Dobson instrument comparisons through 1990 have been presented by McPeters and Komhyr (1991). Dobson spectrophotometer 83 was established as the standard instrument for the U. S. A. <b>Dobson</b> instrument <b>station</b> network in 1962. In 1980, the instrument was designated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as the Standard Dobson Spectrophotometer for the World. Long-term ozone measurement precision of the instrument has been maintained at plus or minus 0. 5 percent (Komhyr et al., 1989). On an absolute scale, the ozone measurement accuracy of the instrument is estimated to plus or minus 3 percent. In early April, 1990, comparison of total ozone and vertical distribution (Umkehr) observations were made {{for the first time}} with Dobson spectrophotometer 8. 3. The work was conducted at the NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) in Boulder, Colorado, and at the research and instrument manufacturing facility of the Ball Aerospace System Division located about 2 km east of Boulder.

40|$|Global {{total ozone}} has been mapped with the Nimbus 7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) {{instrument}} since November 1978. Very detailed daily maps are produced with this instrument {{which has a}} spatial resolution at nadir of 50 km. The data accuracy is better than 2 % under all weather conditions as evaluated by comparison with <b>Dobson</b> spectrophotometer network <b>stations.</b> Coverage is complete at all sunlit latitudes including the poles during non-polar night months. The general structure of southern hemisphere total ozone is a polar minimum surrounded by a circumpolar maximum. Over {{much of the year}} the gradients are quite small except for local midlatitude storms. However, during the spring months the difference between the minimum and the maximum grows with time. The boundary of the polar minimum is generally very sharp with a gradient of 10 Dobson units/ 100 km not uncommon, thus justifying the term "ozone hole" to describe this feature. A station in the boundary region will undergo very large changes in ozone as the position of the hole drifts and fluctuates. Finally, the ozone hole is destroyed as the polar vortex breaks down in November. These characteristics were illustrated during the Symposium in a motion picture of daily ozone maps for a complete year. A second motion picture shows the striking decrease of Antarctic ozone during each of the October months since 1979 to values near 140 Dobson units, far below the lowest (180 Dobson units) ever observed previously at any location. It is this decrease which is the subject of the current controversy over possible fluorocarbon effects on ozone. The data from TOMS show that dynamics are critical {{in the formation of the}} ozone hole.
