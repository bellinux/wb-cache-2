5|$|Geen was {{selected}} to play for Oxford against Cambridge in four consecutive years from 1910 to 1913. In the first of these, on 13 December 1910, a 9,000-strong crowd turned up at Queen's, mostly to watch Ronnie Poulton, playing for Oxford. Cambridge started strong but a try by Bryn Lewis was disallowed in the opening minutes after a touch judge signalled that Geen <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> foot into touch in the preceding Oxford move. Moments later, Poulton ran through the Cambridge defence, drew the fullback and passed to Geen to dive in at the corner for a try. With Turner's conversion, Oxford led 5–0. A similar passage of play again saw Poulton put Geen through for a try, but he dropped the ball after crossing the line while trying {{to get closer to}} the posts.|$|E

5|$|Jennings {{was born}} on July 29, 1938, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; he and his younger sister Sarah {{were the only two}} {{children}} of Elizabeth (née Osborne) and Charles Jennings, a prominent radio broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Peter Jennings started his broadcasting career at the age of nine, hosting Peter's People, a half-hour, Saturday morning, CBC Radio show for kids. His father was on a business trip to the Middle East when the show debuted; upon returning, Charles Jennings, who harbored a deep dislike of nepotism, was outraged to learn that the network <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> son on the air.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's {{choice of}} a four-man team for the {{southern}} journey to the South Pole was largely determined {{by the number of}} surviving ponies. Influenced by his experiences on the Discovery Expedition, he <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> confidence in ponies rather than dogs for the long polar march. The motor car, which ran well on flat ice, could not cope with Barrier surfaces and was not considered for the polar journey. The men chosen by Shackleton to accompany him were Marshall, Adams and Wild. Joyce, whose Antarctic experience exceeded all save Wild's, was excluded from the party after Marshall's medical examination raised doubts about his fitness.|$|E
5|$|In 1925 Smith {{played in}} all four of Scotland's Five Nations matches. The first was against France at Inverleith, where Smith scored four tries, and helped them to win 25–4. He then played against Wales at Swansea and scored another four tries; Scotland again won, this time 24–14. Their third game of the Championship was against Ireland at Lansdowne Road, and {{although}} Smith was unable to score this time, Scotland still won 14–8. Scotland's last match of the Championship was against England at Murrayfield Stadium. This was the first match ever played at Murrayfield, and was watched by over 70,000 spectators. Although Smith did not score himself, {{he was involved in}} a crucial Scottish try: the ball was passed through several hands before Smith passed to Johnnie Wallace who scored in the right-hand corner. English supporters claimed Smith <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> foot into touch, but the Welsh referee disagreed and awarded the try. Eventually Scotland triumphed 14–11 to go undefeated and claim their first ever Five Nations Grand Slam. Smith's eight tries for a single Championship equalled the record set by Cyril Lowe in 1914 and remains an individual record as of 2014.|$|E

5|$|Pressure high up {{the pitch}} from Barcelona kept Manchester United {{in their own}} half, forcing them into {{attempting}} long balls downfield. A scrappy few moments {{in and around the}} centre circle followed, but Manchester United eventually came away with the ball. However, a lapse in communication between Giggs and Evra on the left wing allowed Eto'o to steal in and advance on the Manchester United goal. He cut in from the right wing and played a through-ball just out of reach of Messi, who went to ground after O'Shea <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> hand on Messi's shoulder. A period of sustained pressure from Barcelona followed, culminating with a run from Iniesta, who could only be stopped by a foul from Tevez {{on the edge of the}} Manchester United penalty area. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who curled the ball around the defensive wall and onto the post with Van der Sar beaten.|$|E
5|$|On 20 February 1942 Finucane flew a two-Spitfire sortie to Dunkirk, France. The {{last few}} days had been {{monotonous}} and Finucane was eager to fly and asked Dick Lewis—a 29-year old Australian who <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> age down so he was accepted for pilot training—to fly as his wingman. At 10:55 GMT Finucane took off and headed over Manston toward France. Off the coast, they strafed a small ship and turned north to return home. Finucane spotted two aircraft taking off from Mardyck but lost sight of them. Both Spitfires dropped to sea level. Minutes later two enemy fighters came towards them. They were identified as Focke-Wulf Fw 190s. The Fw 190 had a higher performance than the Spitfire V in all departments other than turning circle and was more heavily armed. Finucane scored hits on the first Fw 190's wing but the enemy quickly gained the advantage and Finucane's Spitfire was hit with six machine gun rounds which blew a piece of fuselage into the cockpit and into his leg. Blood loss induced dizziness and Lewis protected his leader from six more astern attacks. In the last attack the two Fw 190s came from opposite directions. Lewis was able to claim one shot down and the other gave up over the mid-Channel. They taxied to 452's dispersal where Finucane passed out after shutting down the engine. On 2 March Finucane went on leave after spending over a week in hospital. No claim or loss was recorded by JG 26, the resident German fighter unit.|$|E

25|$|A {{great effort}} {{would have been}} needed by the England batsmen {{to put them in}} a {{position}} beyond defeat, and Milton and Bailey went to the wicket with a load on their shoulders. Benaud at once set a very aggressive field, especially to Bailey, where he fielded only three yards from the bat to Meckiff's bowling, a little deeper for Davidson. Bailey had a word with Benaud, no doubt asking him not to move when the bowler was running up to bowl. I thought he was so close that if Bailey <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> bat out to swing at a ball he would have hit him.|$|E
25|$|An {{argument}} against the possible summit claim is the long distance from high camp VI to the summit. It is normally not possible to reach the summit before dark after starting in daylight. It was not until 1990 that Ed Viesturs was able {{to reach the top}} from an equivalent distance as Mallory and Irvine planned. In addition, Viesturs knew the route, while for Mallory and Irvine it was completely unknown territory. Finally, Irvine was not an experienced climber and it is considered unlikely that Mallory <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> friend into such danger or would have aimed for the summit without calculating the risks.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1926, on November 25, Governor General the Marquess of Willingdon {{acted on}} Mackenzie King's advice to appoint Massey {{as the first}} Canadian Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States for His Majesty's Government in Canada, making Massey Canada's first ever envoy with full {{diplomatic}} credentials to a foreign capital. Despite this first in international relations, Massey's time in Washington, D.C., was free of notable events and he returned to Canada in mid-1930, as Mackenzie King <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> name forward for appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. But, merely five days after Massey relinquished his posting to Washington, Mackenzie King's Liberal Party was defeated in the federal election, seeing Richard Bennett appointed as prime minister. The new prime minister objected to Massey as the government's representative to the UK, on the grounds that, as a former Liberal Cabinet member, Massey did not enjoy the political confidence of the new Conservative government that was needed by the individual occupying the position.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, on {{the other}} side, General Branch <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> regiments into the line. From his left, at Fort Thompson, to the brickyard on his right, were the 27th, 37th, 7th, and 35th North Carolina regiments. His reserve was the 33rd Regiment. The right flank of the 35th was {{anchored}} in a brickyard kiln that was loopholed for artillery. The entire line beyond the railroad was occupied by a single regiment, the 26th North Carolina, plus a few companies of cavalry. The gap in his line created by the dogleg at the railroad was covered only by his weakest unit, a militia battalion with only two weeks of training, and armed with shotguns and hunting rifles. To give them additional support, he ordered up a two-gun battery of 24-pounders to the kiln, {{but they were not}} mounted when they came under attack. The First Brigade of the Union Army opposed them from the river to the railroad; right to left, the units were the 25th, 24th, 27th, and 23rd Massachusetts, and the 10th Connecticut. The Beaufort Road ran through the center of this line, and here General Foster placed the howitzers that had been dragged along.|$|E
25|$|The committal {{hearing to}} {{determine}} if there was sufficient evidence for Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with irrefutable evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin had been in his company, Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a side street, Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said {{that the two of them}} then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to Einem's home. This answered the question of how fibres from Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, Einem stated that the two of them had sat on his bed and played with the large harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, Einem stated that he <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> arm around Kelvin and hugged him because Kelvin was upset about how his peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home.|$|E

[...] Later that year, he argued the case of Potter v Rankin before the House of Lords and so impressed Lord Hatherley that a patent of precedence was soon made out, giving Benjamin the privileges of a Queen's Counsel.

[...] In his last years in practice, he demanded an additional fee of 100 guineas (£105) to appear in any court besides the House of Lords and the Privy Council. In 1875, he was made a bencher of Lincoln's Inn.|$|E

Bobby Fischer was the high scorer for his team, with a 3–1 score against Petrosian (two wins and two draws)." [...] "Fischer left no doubt in anyone's mind that he <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> temporary break from the tournament circuit to good use.

500|$|The 2002 World Junior Championships {{were held}} before a home crowd in Kingston, Jamaica, and gave Bolt {{a chance to}} prove his {{credentials}} on the world stage.
