5|$|IAU {{protocol}} is that discovery {{credit for}} a minor planet goes to whoever first submits {{a report to the}} MPC with enough positional data for a decent orbit determination, and that the credited discoverer has priority in naming it.

She <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>of</b> the Roman goddess Proserpina, who was in turn one of Pluto's lovers. However, as a chthonic deity, Ataecina would only have been an appropriate name for an object in orbital resonance with Neptune, which Haumea was not.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Honorinina was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that struck eastern Madagascar in March 1986. The eighth named storm of the season, Honorinina formed on March9 {{to the south of}} Diego Garcia. It moved generally to the west-southwest due to a ridge to the south, gradually intensifying. On March12, the Météo France office on Réunion (MFR) upgraded Honorinina to tropical cyclone status, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>of</b> a minimal hurricane. On the next day, the cyclone attained maximum sustained winds of 150km/h (95mph) while in the vicinity of Tromelin Island. Honorinina weakened subsequently before making landfall about 40km (25mi) north of Toamasina, Madagascar with winds of 135km/h (85mph). The storm weakened further over land, moving southwestward across the country. It emerged into the Mozambique Channel and became extratropical on March18. Honorinina turned to the southeast, dissipating on March23.|$|E
5|$|On September28, 1898, island {{stations}} in the Lesser Antilles indicated {{the presence of a}} tropical cyclone, which was confirmed by the next day. Modern researchers determined that the system developed on September25 about 220miles (350km) east of Guadeloupe. For most of its duration, the system maintained a northwest track, reaching hurricane status on September27. Later that day, a barometric pressure of 977mbar, suggesting winds of 90mph (150km/h). Its intensification rate slowed on September28, before strengthening continued on October1. The winds reached 115mph (185km/h), which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>of</b> a major hurricane, or Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Around that time, the hurricane turned toward more to the west-northwest, due to a large ridge across the western Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Sudal {{originally}} {{formed on}} April2, 2004, {{out of a}} persistent area of convection east of the FSM. It moved mostly westward {{for the first week}} of its duration, with brief northerly and southwesterly turns. Sudal attained tropical storm status on April5, and it gradually intensified into a typhoon, which is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 119km/h (74mph) and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>of</b> a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. On April9, it passed just south of Yap, and shortly thereafter its peak winds were estimated at 240km/h (150mph). Later, Sudal moved to the northwest and eventually to the northeast, becoming an extratropical cyclone on April16 and dissipating two days later.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Bingiza {{was located in}} an area of weak steering currents, which resulted in a slow, meandering motion toward the southwest. Its motion turned to the south on February10, with conditions only marginally favorable for further intensification. After two days of meandering without strengthening, Bingiza turned to the southwest on due to a building ridge to its southwest toward Madagascar. Around the same time, upper-level conditions began improving, which allowed the convection to increase in coverage. Based on the improved appearance, MF upgraded Bingiza to a severe tropical storm at 0600UTC on February12 about 335km (210mi) east of the coast of Madagascar. Later that day an eye became apparent on satellite imagery, signaling the beginning of a rapid deepening trend. Late on February12, MF upgraded Bingiza to tropical cyclone intensity, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>of</b> a hurricane or typhoon. With minimal wind shear and warm waters, the agency forecast the cyclone to intensify further to peak 10sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph). Continuing to strengthen, Bingiza attained 10minute sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph) early on February13. Similarly, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph), noting a contracting eye 37km (23mi) in diameter in the process of an eyewall replacement cycle.|$|E
