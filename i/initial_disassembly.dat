50|$|The W33 {{mechanism}} {{has been}} reported to have comprised two critical nuclear parts which were required to assemble a complete W33 warhead. The <b>initial</b> <b>disassembly</b> of stockpiled W33 warheads in 1992 proceeded first by disassembling all existing parts for one of the components, and then disassembling the other one in following years.|$|E
40|$|There {{are still}} {{considerable}} deficiencies in computational tools available even for following accidents to <b>initial</b> <b>disassembly.</b> Present {{indications are that}} such a disassembly will be mild, without much sensitivity of this result to modeling assumptions, but the LOF-driven TOP requires better analysis. It is not possible at present to follow {{the course of an}} accident mechanistically beyond a first disassembly. Plugging and recriticality are possibilities, but so far do not appear likely to lead to a substantial increase in accident severity. It seems unlikely that the destructive work in an HCDA will be large enough to cause difficulties in containment. However, complete melting of the core material is a desirable assumption for PAHR analysis. It is not possible at present to predict what the relative upward and downward ejection of core material will be. (auth...|$|E
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{software}} is distributed {{in the form of}} executable code. The ability to reverse engineer such executables can create opportunities for theft of intel-lectual property via software piracy, as well as security breaches by allowing attackers to discover vulnerabil-ities in an application. The process of reverse engi-neering an executable program typically begins with disassembly, which translates machine code to assem-bly code. This is then followed by various decompila-tion steps that aim to recover higher-level abstractions from the assembly code. Most of the work to date on code obfuscation has focused on disrupting or confus-ing the decompilation phase. This paper, by contrast, focuses on the <b>initial</b> <b>disassembly</b> phase. Our goal is to disrupt the static disassembly process so as to make programs harder to disassemble correctly. We describe two widely used static disassembly algorithms, and discuss techniques to thwart each of them. Experimen-tal results indicate that significant portions of executa-bles that have been obfuscated using our techniques are disassembled incorrectly, thereby showing the ef-ficacy of our methods. ...|$|E
5000|$|One of the game's {{principal}} features is {{a constantly}} expanding catalog of animated 3D models {{that dates back}} to 2010 (the date of <b>initial</b> Gun <b>Disassembly</b> app's release). On average, developer Noble Empire has been releasing one to two new models monthly. According to developers, 3D models are drawn and animated using actual weapons, original technical documentation and photographic sources. As of early 2017, the World of Guns library consists of 165 models, with over 20 500 individual animated parts total. This includes historical and modern firearms, as well as several artillery pieces, motorcycles, automobiles (including Humvee and DeLorean DMC-12), an armored vehicle (BMP-3) and a warbird (F4U Corsair). Another set of [...] "bonus" [...] models includes dinosaur and mammal skeletons.|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of an intact tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) particle was determined at 2. 9 A resolution using fibre diffraction methods. All residues of the coat protein {{and the three}} nucleotides of RNA that are bound to each protein subunit were visible in the electron density map. Examination of the structures of TMV, cucumber green mottle mosaic virus and ribgrass mosaic virus, and site-directed mutagenesis experiments in which carboxylate groups were changed to the corresponding amides, showed that <b>initial</b> stages of <b>disassembly</b> are driven by complex electrostatic interactions involving at least seven carboxylate side-chains and a phosphate group. The locations of these interactions can drift during evolution, allowing the viruses to evade plant defensive responses that depend on recognition of the viral coat protein surface...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis reports on the research undertaken to analyse the factors affecting End-of-Life (EoL) recycling of future Electric Vehicles (EVs). The principle objective of the research is to generate an understanding of challenges and opportunities for {{the development and implementation}} of an automated robotic disassembly approach to aid with EoL management of electrical and electronic components within EVs. The research contributions are considered in three main parts. The first part contains a review of advancement in the development of automotive technology, and in particular the alternative fuel vehicles. A review of existing industrial recycling technologies and processes has been conducted which highlighted a number of key challenges in the adoption of current recycling technologies for EVs. The review concludes that there is a need to develop novel recycling technologies and processes to deal with the increased part complexity and material mixture in such vehicles. In this context, the second part of the research details a framework for EoL management of EV components. This framework presents a comprehensive automated robotic disassembly approach in which three specific steps are defined, namely manual disassembly to develop an understanding of product design, <b>initial</b> automated <b>disassembly</b> to test process capability, and optimisation and validation to improve repeatability and efficiency of the robotic disassembly operations. The framework also includes the development of a multi-criteria decision-making tool that assesses the environmental, technological and economic benefits of such robotic disassembly approach. The applicability of the research concepts has been demonstrated via three case studies. The results have highlighted the applicability of the automated robotic disassembly approach in a variety of scenarios of different design complexity and recovery rate. The results indicate that the adoption of this robotic disassembly enhances the pre-concentration of Strategically Important Materials (SIMs) and leads to minimisation of environmental impacts and increased material recovery value...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} {{the relationship between the}} reorganisation of actin cytoskeleton and the changes at cell surface level (i. e. PS exposure and blebbing) in two neoplastic cell lines during apoptosis: Chang liver cells (adherent culture) and promyelocytic HL- 60 cells (suspension culture), treated with the podophyllotoxin derivative VP 16. The morphological analysis, performed by means of conventional fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy, on Chang cells showed that onset and progress of the two processes are synchronised. The <b>initial</b> <b>disassembly</b> of stress fibers was associated with the early PS exposure on the cell surface. Moreover, the accumulation of actin at cortical level appeared strongly associated with an intense labelling for Annexin V and, in some cases, especially in the areas of membrane blebbing. The double staining for actin and PS exposure, quantitatively analysed by flow cytometry in HL- 60 cells after different treatment times, demonstrated that the decrease of Annexin V binding in the late stages of apoptosis is associated with the strong reduction of actin labelling probably also due to a proteolytic cleavage. These events were also partially related to variations of 255 the functional state of mitochondria, by analysing cytofluorometrically the dissipation of the inner membrane potential (DYm) ...|$|E
40|$|Following {{the failure}} of the lower inner coil of magnet DD 000 Z on November 3, 1987, a {{committee}} was formed on November 11 and given the following charges: `To review the events leading up to and including {{the failure of}} the coils of magnet DD 000 Z. The intent of the review will be to determine the cause of the failure and to make recommendations to reduce the likelihood of such failures in the future. Given {{the fact that this is}} the first long magnet to be disassembled, the committee may uncover leads which point to other opportunities for improvement. The committee should follow up on these leads. The committee should prepare a plan to serve as an initial guide for the disassembly and provide guidance as the disassembly progresses. ` The committee held its first meeting at FNAL on 17 and 18 Nov to review the record of events leading up to the failure and to establish an <b>initial</b> <b>disassembly</b> procedure. This was followed by further meetings at FNAL, BNL, and CDG, leading to this final report. Committee activities included interviewing personnel who had been involved in the design, assembly and testing of DD 000 Z, reviewing all documents relating to the magnet and its failure, and participating in and providing guidance during the disassembly. The intention of the committee was to report factual findings, to consider well founded hypotheses, not to consider conjecture and to avoid speculation...|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{two sets}} of {{experiments}} were performed {{in order to provide}} further evidence of the origin of the cells in the biofilm bulk fluid. One of the major aspects differentiating biofilms from planktonic cultures is their characteristic tolerance to antibiotics and particular gene expression profile. Previously it was thought that soon after being released from a biofilm, bacteria would regain the characteristic planktonic cellâ€™s sensitivity to antimicrobials (Chua et al. 2014; Lauderdale et al. 2010). However, opposing observations have been reported for different bacterial species (Liu et al. 2013; Rollet et al. 2009). Our results showed that S. epidermidis Brc were more tolerant than planktonic cells to the three classes of antibiotics tested. An identical tolerance profile was observed between the cells recently detached from the biofilm (Brc. 0) and biofilms cells suggesting that these cells were originated from the established biofilm. Moreover, Brc retained their antimicrobial tolerance phenotype, despite being in the planktonic mode of growth. Curiously, after 12 Â h (Brc. 12), a significant reduction in the susceptibility to tetracycline was observed. This effect was kept constant up to 24 Â h (Brc. 24) after the <b>initial</b> <b>disassembly.</b> Interestingly, we also showed that if Brc are {{in the presence of the}} originating biofilm, they could maintain the high tolerance to antibiotics but, if centrifuged, suspended and transferred to an independent flask, they would eventually lose that tolerance, as observed for other bacterial species (Chua et al. 2014). This phenomenon is likely to be related to quorum-sensing regulation, which has been shown to be involved in tolerance to antibiotics (Singh and Ray 2014).|$|E
40|$|Phosphorylation of {{purified}} microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) inhibits {{the rate}} {{and extent of}} MAP-stimulated microtubule assembly. The extent of microtubule assembly is reduced {{as a result of}} a decrease in the fraction of tubulin polymerized, without a significant change in the critical protein concentration. The decreased rate of microtubule assembly using phosphorylated MAPs reflects a reduction in microtubule nucleation resulting in fewer, but 2 -fold longer, microtubules at steady state. Analysis of microtubule (MT) dynamics at steady state reveals that the rate of directional incorporation of subunits (flux) is 22 subunits. MT- 1. sec- 1 with phosphorylated MAPs, compared to 10 subunits. MT- 1. sec- 1 with unphosphorylated MAPs. The <b>initial</b> rate of <b>disassembly</b> determined by isothermal dilution is 232 subunits. MT- 1. sec- 1 for microtubules assembled with phosphorylated MAPs, compared to 102 subunits. MT- 1. sec- 1 for microtubules assembled with unphosphorylated MAPs. By using these results, the directionality (the number of successful subunit additions relative to the total number of association events per unit time) for subunit addition is found to be 0. 1 for microtubules assembled with either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated MAPs. These observations are interpreted in terms of a mechanism in which phosphorylation of MAPs increases the rate of steady-state subunit flux by an equivalent enhancement of the rates of subunit association and dissociation, such that the critical protein concentration and directionality remain unchanged...|$|R
