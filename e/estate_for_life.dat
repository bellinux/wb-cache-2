5000|$|At {{the time}} of the Conquest, William I of England granted fiefs to his lords {{in the manner of a}} {{continental}} or feudal benefice which assured little beyond a life tenure. The English charters were careful to avoid saying the donee was to take the <b>estate</b> <b>for</b> <b>life,</b> or whether the heir was to have any rights. At this time, there is abundant evidence that lords refused to regrant on any terms to the deceased tenant's heirs; the deed phrase [...] "to A and his heirs and assigns" [...] is the product of efforts by purchasers to preserve such rights on behalf of those who might inherit or purchase the land from them. The practice of demanding a monetary payment for regranting of tenancy to the heirs quickly became the norm.|$|E

The wedding was celebrated with lavish festivity including games in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, as fully described by the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, William of Tyre, who happened to be present. [...] Renier was given the title Caesar, was renamed John, and (according to some Western sources) was granted Thessalonica, presumably as an <b>estate</b> <b>for</b> <b>life,</b> a pronoia.

Thus Renier became entangled in the perpetual power struggle around the Byzantine throne.|$|E
50|$|Early in life, his {{guardian}} sued on {{his behalf}} to obtain the estate of Stanwell, Middlesex. Upon the death of Falkland's first cousin once removed, John Cary, in 1686, he had left that estate in trust to his great-niece, Elizabeth Willoughby, provided that she would marry Lord Guilford within three years of his death; the inheritance was otherwise {{to go to the}} 5th Viscount and his heirs, then to Edward Cary and his heirs. Elizabeth's trustees came to an agreement with Falkland and Edward Cary to allow her to enjoy the <b>estate</b> <b>for</b> <b>life,</b> notwithstanding her failure to marry Lord Guilford, and she afterwards married James Bertie. However, the agreement ended upon the deaths of Edward Cary and Falkland, and Lucius' guardian sued in the Court of Chancery, which found in his favor, to obtain the estate. The Berties appealed to the House of Lords, and obtained a compromise which gave Elizabeth a life interest in the estate, with reversion to Lucius.|$|E
50|$|In 1910, the Shrady Family {{successfully}} claimed {{two thirds}} of the Appley estate (worth nearly $1 million {{at the time of the}} settlement) finally resolving a legal battle that was initiated in the 1860s. The founder of the estate was Jacob Appley, the son of a German immigrant who started out as a butcher. In the early 1800s he made a big score by cornering the mutton market and he began investing in properties around the lower east side on Eldridge, Delancey, Forsyth, Bayard, and First Streets. When he died in 1840 he left the estate, which included about 40 houses, in trust for his only son, Jacob Alexander Appley (Jacob A.). The trust document, one of the earliest of its kind, provided Jacob A. with the income from the <b>estate</b> <b>for</b> <b>life</b> and saved the properties to be distributed to Jacob A's issue (children) after his death. In case no issue existed the trust named old Jacob's sister Barbara (Shrady) and her heirs as the beneficiaries. As Barbara's grandson, Dr. George Frederick Shrady was one potential beneficiary.|$|E

50|$|Often the {{mechanism}} is employed {{to avoid a}} specific tax. For example, a wealthy testator could transfer his house into an offshore company; he can then settle the shares of the company on trust (with himself being a trustee with another trustee, whilst holding the beneficial <b>life</b> <b>estate)</b> <b>for</b> himself <b>for</b> <b>life,</b> and then to his daughter. On his death, the shares will automatically vest in the daughter, who thereby acquires the house, without the house {{having to go through}} probate and being assessed with inheritance tax. Most countries assess inheritance tax, and all other taxes, on real estate within their jurisdiction, regardless of the nationality of the owner, so this would not work with a house in most countries. It {{is more likely to be}} done with intangible assets.|$|R
50|$|Elizabeth {{had been}} left an {{extensive}} legacy by her great-uncle John Cary (d. 1686), including the manor of Stanwell, {{on the condition that}} she would marry Lord Guilford within three years of his death; the inheritance otherwise to go to Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount of Falkland (d. 1694), John's first cousin twice removed, and his heirs and afterwards to Edward Cary (d. 1692), John's first cousin, and his heirs. Her trustees came to an agreement with Falkland and Edward Cary to allow her to enjoy the <b>estate</b> <b>for</b> <b>life,</b> notwithstanding her failure to marry Lord Guilford, and she afterwards married Bertie. However, the agreement ended upon the deaths of Edward Cary and Falkland, and when Edward's son Lucius succeeded Anthony in the peerage, his guardian sued Elizabeth to claim the estate. The Court of Chancery found in favour of Lord Falkland in 1698, and Bertie appealed the decree to the House of Lords. He was successful in obtaining a life interest for Elizabeth in the Stanwell estate, with reversion to Lord Falkland, but a paper circulated by his brother Robert on his behalf abused Lord Chancellor Somers in such terms as to create a scandal, for which Lord Abingdon was compelled to apologise in the Lords.|$|E
40|$|As {{the right}} to sell may exist either {{as a result of}} ownership, or by virtue of a power without or {{independent}} of ownership, it is sometimes a question whether words indicating a right to sell, contained in an instrument granting an estate, are intended to give a power, or are merely descriptive of the rights incident to the estate given. When property is devised without any designation of the estate given, and the devise is followed by words indicating that the devisee is to have the right of absolute disposal in fee, or to sell in fee, it has often been held that the words indicating an absolute power of disposal show that the devisee was intended by the testator to have an estate in fee, not a life estate with a testamentary power of appointing the reversion. (See note 18 L. R. A. N. S. 463.) If the devise were expressly of an <b>estate</b> <b>for</b> <b>life,</b> no such inference could be indulged; and {{it would have to be}} held that the right of disposal given was merely a testamentary power to appoint the reversion...|$|E
40|$|The {{central theme}} of this study {{comprises}} the judicial and legislative rules developed to restrict attempts by men of property to endow their families in perpetuity, usually with land, in such manner that each successive living generation can neither part with the property nor prevent unborn generations from succeeding to it. Part One deals with attempts to accomplish this object by bestowing the whole title on each living generation but denying each such generation the power {{to dispose of the}} property or to prevent its· descent to the next generation. In this part the principal restrictive rules are judicial, the common-law rules against restraints on alienation. Part Two deals with attempts to accomplish the same object by splitting the title into present and future estates; bestowing only an <b>estate</b> <b>for</b> <b>life</b> on the currently living generation and conveying future estates directly to unborn generations, so that the currently living generation cannot cut them off. In this part the principal restrictive rules are likewise judicial, the common law Rule Against Perpetuities and the common-law Rule Against Accumulations. Part Two also deals with a partial statutory substitute for the common law Rule Against Accumulations which was in force in Michigan from 1847 to 1952. Part Three deals with a group of Michigan statutes, applicable to dispositions of land made between 184 7 and 1949, which partially superseded the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities and supplemented, but did not supersede, the common-law rules against restraints on alienation.

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the Tamir Triad, Skala has a clearly feudal society, with nobles living in castles and {{maintaining}} their own armed forces - those of the bigger nobles nearly rivaling in power the Royal Army. The winning of a civil war, such as takes place in [...] "The Oracle's Queen", depends on winning the support of enough nobles who bring their own feudal levies to support one of the contending parties. This situation has changed fundamentally by the tine of The Nightrunner Series, six hundred years later. While some things have not changed from Tamir's time (e.g. Skala's perennial enmity with Plenimar), the Skala where Alec and Seregil live is no longer feudal. The only army is the Royal Army, completely under the Queen's control. The nobility lives mainly in urban villas or at the Royal court, drawing on the income of their <b>estates</b> <b>for</b> a <b>life</b> of luxury, but no longer have their own armed forces - a situation reminiscent of Western Europe in the 17th or 18th Century.|$|R
60|$|The {{operation}} of this law, however certain, {{might be too}} slow. The present possessors might happen to be long-lived. The legislature knew the natural impatience of expectants, and upon this principle they gave encouragement to children to anticipate the inheritance. For it is provided, that the eldest son of any Papist shall, immediately on his conformity, change entirely the nature and properties of his father's legal estate: if he before held in fee simple, or, in other words, had the entire and absolute dominion over the land, he is reduced to an <b>estate</b> <b>for</b> his <b>life</b> only, with all {{the consequences of the}} natural debility of that estate, by which he becomes disqualified to sell, mortgage, charge, (except <b>for</b> his <b>life,)</b> or in any wise to do any act by which he may raise money for relief in his most urgent necessities. The eldest son, so conforming, immediately acquires, and in the lifetime of his father, the permanent part, what our law calls the reversion and inheritance of the estate; and he discharges it by retrospect, and annuls every sort of voluntary settlement made by the father ever so long before his conversion. This he may sell or dispose of immediately, and alienate it from the family forever.|$|R

60|$|To {{begin with}} the first great {{instrument}} of national happiness and strength, its industry: I must observe, that, although these penal laws do, indeed, inflict many hardships on those who are obnoxious to them, yet their chief, their most extensive, and most certain operation is upon property. Those civil constitutions which promote industry are such as facilitate the acquisition, secure the holding, enable the fixing, and suffer the alienation of property. Every law which obstructs it {{in any part of}} this distribution is, in proportion to the force and extent of the obstruction, a discouragement to industry. For a law against property is a law against industry,--the latter having always the former, and nothing else, for its object. Now as to the acquisition of landed property, which is the foundation and support of all the other kinds, the laws have disabled three fourths of the inhabitants of Ireland from acquiring any <b>estate</b> of inheritance <b>for</b> <b>life</b> or years, or any charge whatsoever on which two thirds of the improved yearly value is not reserved for thirty years.|$|R

An earlier codicil, written to his trustees, directed that an annuity of £600, drawing on his remaining estates in Devon and Cornwall, was to be used to pay for the upkeep of his horses and dogs, the surplus to go to his legatee, Mrs. Levina Luther. Mrs. Luther was the wife of John Luther and stepdaughter of Richard Bull; Morice left his <b>estate</b> to her <b>for</b> <b>life,</b> and to her half-sisters Elizabeth and Catherine Bull after her death, but the three agreed to divide the estate equally.
