40|$|Using Beijing as an example, this {{research}} demonstrates that smartcard {{data can be}} used to (a) assemble the required data for excess commuting studies, and (b) visualise related results. Based on both smartcard and household travel survey data, we find that the theoretical minimum commute is considerably lower for bus users than <b>for</b> <b>car</b> users in Beijing. This suggests that there is a greater inter-mixing of jobs–housing functions (i. e., a better jobs–housing balance) associated with users of that mode compared to the corresponding land-use arrangement <b>for</b> <b>car</b> users, who locate further from the central area (Tian’anmen) than bus users. The commuting range <b>for</b> <b>car</b> users is 9. 4 km greater than for bus users. Excess commuting is slightly higher for bus users (69. 5 %) than <b>for</b> <b>car</b> users (68. 8 %). Commuting capacity values are slightly lower <b>for</b> <b>car</b> users than <b>for</b> bus users, implying that car users consume less of their available commuting resources overall than bus users, albeit only marginally...|$|R

5|$|Muntz {{designed}} a stereo tape player called the Autostereo <b>for</b> <b>cars</b> {{and had it}} inexpensively manufactured in Japan. The Autostereo could play a complete album without changing tracks or turning the tape over, did not suffer from skipping or premature wear as the phonograph-based players did, and its number of knobs and controls were minimized to allow the driver {{to concentrate on the}} road. The tape player gave customers greater control over their listening experiences, because the tapes never ran advertisements or public service announcements, unlike radio broadcasts. Muntz sold the players and cartridges from his own stores and through franchises in Florida and Texas.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the bridge}} {{would be the}} only road from the {{mainland}} to the archipelago, tolls could be collected in only one direction. The tolls were set to NOK40 for semitrailers, NOK30 for buses, NOK20 for trucks, NOK12 <b>for</b> <b>cars,</b> NOK5 for motorcycles, NOK4 for bicycles, NOK2 for adults and 1 for children. Discounts were available at the same rates as for ferries. The four people who had worked the longest on the ferry were offered the job as toll plaza employees. From 1972, the bookkeeping of the company was transferred from the company's secretary to Bergens Privatbank's branch in Sotra, while the auditing was placed at Hordaland County Auditing.|$|E

5|$|The {{evidence}} on the convergence of prices in the eurozone {{with the introduction of}} the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s. Other studies have found evidence of price convergence, in particular <b>for</b> <b>cars.</b> A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).|$|E

Regus founder Mark Dixon's first business on returning to Britain after an extended time aboard was a hot-dog stand on the North Circular Road, making his own buns.

5|$|In early 2015, {{as part of}} its expansion, NYCDOT and Motivate {{increased}} the price of annual memberships from $95 to $149 plus taxes, although annual rates for New York City Housing Authority residents and members of some Community Development Credit Unions will remain at $60 per year. That year, the company installed 91 new stations in Queens and Brooklyn, with 12 of these stations in Long Island City and the other 79 in Greenpoint, Williamsburg, and Bedford-Stuyvesant. Citi Bike also added 48 new stations on the Upper East and Upper West Sides, up to 86th Street. The system expanded across the Hudson River to Jersey City, New Jersey, on September 21, 2015, with 35 stations and 350 bikes. However, some Jersey City residents objected to the implementation of Citi Bike there, complaining of lost parking spots <b>for</b> <b>cars.</b> In July 2016, the Jersey City Citi Bike system was expanded for the first time, with another 15 stations and an additional 150 bikes.|$|E
5|$|In late 2005, FETA's {{committee}} {{approved a}} proposal for a revamp of the tolls. The minimum toll would be set to the existing £1figure, but would increase dependent on the time of day, rising to a maximum of £4 for evening rush hour travel. All tolls would be halved <b>for</b> <b>cars</b> with more than one occupant, as an incentive to drivers to share cars and make fewer journeys. According to FETA's chairman Lawrence Marshall, the system would provide the most efficiency, claiming that 80% of peak-time journeys are made by single-occupant vehicles. The proposal, passed with the chairman's casting vote after the committee was deadlocked, was referred to the Scottish Executive in December 2005, and implementation planned for October 2007 subject to approval by transport minister Tavish Scott. Environmental groups welcomed the proposal, although local politicians condemned it as simply a means of raising capital. At the same time, a counter-argument was tabled by Fife councillors proposing the complete removal of tolls.|$|E
