25|$|In his sleep, he {{was making}} {{guttural}} noises, with his mouth pulled to the right, ‘as if he was chewing his tongue’. We heard her making strange noises ‘like roaring’ and found her unresponsive, head raised from the pillow, <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>open,</b> rivers of saliva {{coming out of her}} mouth, rigid.|$|E
25|$|By the way, {{would you}} convey my {{compliments}} to the purist who reads your proofs {{and tell him}} or her that I write {{in a sort of}} broken-down patois which is something like the way a Swiss-waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will remain split, and when I interrupt the velvety smoothness of my more or less literate syntax with a few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this is done with the <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>open</b> and the mind relaxed and attentive. The method may not be perfect, but it is all I have.|$|E

60|$|Hamilton obeyed. He had {{scarcely}} made ten {{steps in}} advance, when a single bird, {{that seemed to}} have been separated from the others, ran suddenly out from under a bush, and stood stock-still, at a distance of a few yards, with its neck stretched out and its black <b>eye</b> <b>wide</b> <b>open,</b> as if in astonishment.|$|R

25|$|Rutten found {{a measure}} of {{redemption}} after the upset loss by choking out expert grappler and King of Pancrase Tournament Finalist Manabu Yamada in his next fight, on January 26, 1995. Rutten {{was taken to the}} ground, but he clamped an arm triangle choke from half guard and exerted such a pressure that Yamada, refusing to tap out, was choked out and remained unconscious with his <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>open</b> after the hold. Thanks to this performance against the tournament finalist, Rutten received a rematch and a title shot against tournament winner and then current King of Pancrase Ken Shamrock for the King of Pancrase title on March 10. The match was very anticipated, but it ended early when Shamrock executed a kneebar and forced Rutten to submit. According to the Dutch, the loss was due to his training partner Funaki teaching him the wrong way to escape a kneebar, which made Rutten spin in the opposite direction giving a tighter hold for Shamrock. After this failure, Rutten focused on grappling even harder and started training 2 to 3 times a day solely on submissions.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1980, Vysotsky gave a {{performance}} at a suburban Moscow concert hall. One {{of the stage}} managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy ("gray-faced", as she puts it) and complained of not feeling too good, while another says she was surprised by his request for champagne {{before the start of}} the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played Hamlet for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him back from the brink. The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned and screamed in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysostsky's personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from clinical death a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing an asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky told his mother that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him clench his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this, but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky's condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the moaning and groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then sat down on the couch next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence, and found Vysotsky dead in his bed with his <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>open,</b> apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov's colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul'povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor's instant hospitalization on 23 July, but were, allegedly, defied by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov's incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky's parents (who were eager to have their son's drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.|$|E
500|$|Multiple allegorical {{interpretations of}} 2001 have been proposed, {{including}} {{seeing it as}} a commentary on Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical tract Thus Spoke Zarathustra, or as an allegory of human conception, birth and death. The latter can be seen through the final moments of the film, which are defined by {{the image of the}} [...] "star child," [...] an in utero fetus that draws on the work of Lennart Nilsson. The star child signifies a [...] "great new beginning," [...] and is depicted naked and ungirded, but with its <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>open.</b> Leonard F. Wheat sees Space Odyssey as a multi-layered allegory, commenting simultaneously on Nietzsche, Homer, and the relationship of man to machine.|$|E

500|$|... "Schoolin' Life" [...] is an uptempo R and funk song, which {{contains}} elements of disco and dance-pop. Built on a 1980s-inspired beat, the song's instrumentation includes old school synthesizers, 1980s-sounding drum kits wailing electric guitars, and horns. Music critics, including Jamie Peck of MTV noted that [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] {{was inspired by}} the prime work of Prince, particularly because of its lyrical content, the instruments used, and Knowles' style of singing on it. Lyrically, the song finds Knowles detailing her experiences as she was growing up. In the first verse, she employs guttural vocals to address many life lessons to [...] "20-somethings", [...] "30-somethings", [...] "40-somethings", and [...] "50-somethings". Knowles warns them against some consequences, affirming [...] "time really moves fast" [...] and that growing up fast will leave them wanting more. Knowles also talks about still excelling in a world where parents try to shield everything, [...] "Mom and dad tried to hide the world / Said the world's just too big for a little girl / <b>Eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>open</b> can't you see / I had my first heels by the age of 13".|$|E
2500|$|Page {{signed with}} Mercury Records in 1947, and became their first {{successful}} female artist, starting with 1948's [...] "Confess". In 1950, {{she had her}} first million-selling single [...] "With My <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Open,</b> I'm Dreaming", and would eventually have 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965.|$|E
2500|$|Scarpati has {{produced}} two books {{based on his}} photography work. [...] This first, called <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Open,</b> {{is a collection of}} unusual and artistic images from his work. The Second is called Cramp, Slash, & Burn: When Punk and Glam Were Twins, and focuses on Scarpati's work in the Hollywood music scene in the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|The {{photography}} artwork in <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Open</b> {{began as}} an art show exhibit in alternative venues, such as clubs, bars, and hotels. [...] While there {{may appear to be}} no obvious cohesive theme to the book, the concept is a collection of fine art prints on a wide array of Substrates. The collection contains a number of artistic examples of the photographer’s work and showcases his creativity.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of her career, her way of acting was described as [...] "naive" [...] and [...] "pure", and by the end as [...] "noble." [...] Her roles were solemn, sensitive, but cold and elegant; she also did comedy, and the press called her [...] "the darling of the public". Her most appreciated role, Sömngångaren (Sleepwalker) by Piccini, can describe the style she had; here, she walked, talked, and finally danced, during which she showed no feelings whatsoever, just like a sleepwalker, and stared with <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>open,</b> unseeing and expressionless.|$|E

2500|$|The {{last part}} of the novel is devoted to the {{circumstances}} of Norkus' (or Heini Völker's) death. According to Baird (1992), Schenzinger's version is a [...] "thinly veiled parallel to Resurrection": When his comrades were gathered around his death bed and wonder whether he is still alive, there [...] "suddenly [...] is a scream. Heini is sitting up in bed, his <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>open.</b> He is singing. They don't recognise the words, but they know the melody. It's the song they sing every day, every evening together, on every march. Everyone knows what it means - death is singing here." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Scarpati (born June 29, 1960) is a {{professional}} photographer whose photography has appeared on hundreds of album and CD covers for bands and individual musicians. [...] He is also the owner of Scarpati Studio, a photography studio that does photography and layouts for advertising campaigns, {{some of which have}} won national and regional awards. Scarpati has produced two books based on his photography: Cramp, Slash, & Burn: When Punk and Glam Were Twins [...] and <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Open.</b> The first major solo art exhibit of Scarpat’s work was in 1991 at Midem - Palais des Festivals in Cannes, France. The exhibit was a dye transfer print series. Scarpati’s work has also appeared in publications such as the New York Times and Rolling Stone Magazine.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Page had {{her first}} million-selling single [...] "With My <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Open,</b> I'm Dreaming", another song where she {{harmonized}} her vocals. Because she was overdubbing her vocals, Page's name would be listed on the Pop charts as a group name. According to one early-1950s' chart, Page was titled as [...] "The Patti Page Quartet," [...] among others. Towards the middle of 1950, Page's single, [...] "All My Love (Bolero)" [...] peaked at No.1 on Billboard magazine, becoming her first No.1 hit, spending five weeks there. That same year, she also {{had her first}} Top 10 hit with [...] "I Don't Care if the Sun Don't Shine", {{as well as the}} Top 25 single, [...] "Back in Your Own Backyard".|$|E
