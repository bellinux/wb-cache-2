5|$|Although she has {{campaigned on}} her husband's behalf since {{early in his}} {{political}} career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago {{asked if there was}} any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had <b>given</b> <b>her</b> some new decorating ideas. Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.|$|E

5|$|Larter defined Clear {{as a girl}} who's {{suffered}} numerous {{losses in}} her life, has fallen into herself, and has made a life within that.

Larter dyed her hair brunette {{for the majority of}} the film to suit Clear's gothic outlook. Despite this, Larter reverted to her original blonde hair colour for the film's ending.|$|E

5|$|Melanie {{was created}} by {{producer}} Mara Brock Akil.

Mowry considered the character to be her first adult role and felt it emphasized her individuality and maturity. She identified closely with the part, observing parallels between Melanie's relationship with Derwin and her own marriage to actor Cory Hardrict. She cited The Game as an example of women receiving more lead roles on television.|$|E

Ryder's father is an atheist and her mother is a Buddhist; they encouraged their children to take the best part of other religions and use them to make their own belief systems.|$|E
