50|$|To begin with, the {{material}} is heated up to promote superplasticity. For titanium alloys e.g. Ti 6Al 4V and some stainless steels this is around 900 C and for aluminium alloys e.g. AA5083 it is between 450-520 °C. In this state {{the material}} becomes soft so processes that are usually used on plastics can be applied, such as: thermoforming, blow <b>forming,</b> <b>and</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming.</b> Inert gas pressure is applied on the superplastic sheet forcing it into a female die.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{manufacturing}} process is injection molding, using {{materials such as}} polystyrene, polypropylene and cyclo-olefin for different temperature and chemical resistance needs.

Composite microplates, In addition filter bottom platesSPE plates and even some advanced PCR plate designs use multiple components which are moulded separately and later assembled into a finished product.

50|$|Most modern acrylic {{canopies}} are <b>vacuum</b> <b>formed.</b> A {{sheet of}} acrylic is secured {{to a female}} mould, then the entire assembly is heated in an oven until the acrylic is pliable. The air is then removed from the mould and the acrylic sheet is drawn into it, forming {{the shape of the}} canopy. The acrylic is then trimmed to the appropriate shape and attached to an aluminum or composite frame. Some one-off canopies are made in a similar fashion, but since a mould would be too time-consuming to make, the acrylic is heated <b>and</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>formed</b> until it approximates the shape the builder is seeking. This type of construction is less precise, however, and each canopy is unique. If multiple canopies will be needed, a mould is almost always used.|$|R

50|$|Huygens, however, became {{interested}} in the mechanical power of the <b>vacuum,</b> <b>and</b> the possibility of using gunpowder to produce one. In 1678 he outlined a gunpowder engine consisting of a vertical tube containing a piston. Gunpowder was inserted into the tube and lit through a small hole at the base, like a cannon. The expanding gasses would drive the piston up the tube until the reached a point near the top. Here, the piston uncovered holes in the tube that allowed any remaining hot gasses to escape. The weight of the piston <b>and</b> the <b>vacuum</b> <b>formed</b> by the cooling gasses in the now-closed cylinder drew the piston back into the tube, lifting a test mass to provide power.|$|R

The paper describes the findings of a number of investigations which aimed to establish the feasibility of the applying digital development processes within studio pottery production. This practice based research project was particularly concerned with utilising the principle of layer manufacturing models and prototypes. The project’s remit was to establish feasible creative development processes of incorporating this method. The project also sought to investigate the potential of the visual evidence of the layer manufacture as a distinctive aesthetic quality in the artefacts created with this development process. In that regard the project succeeded in establishing new ways of manually resetting conventional LOM rapid prototyping machines (laminated Object manufacture), to achieve a more distinctive layered appearance in the objects created. The project also succeeded in establishing new ways of creating models independent from the use of Rapid Prototyping. This was done by combining software driven layer creation with existing development processes including 2 D CNC laser cutting <b>and</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> to establish a complete development process which can used to achieve production moulds directly from prototype forms...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{residual}} stresses in extruded sheets is investigated by digital image correlation during the heating, sagging <b>and</b> subsequent <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> step of {{high impact polystyrene}} sheets.

40|$|In {{a time of}} {{accelerated}} environmental degradation, a human-centric {{approach to}} engagement has engendered a pervasive cultural passivity towards the environment. This fatalistic detachment amplified by technological advances and, in Canada, the vastness of our landscape demands that we reanimate our perception of the natural world. Environmental intimacy aims to dissolve the “I-it” relationship through an affective merging of subject and object, recognizing that just as we move through the landscape, the landscape moves through us, resulting in heightened ecological attunement. This research uses the sensing human body as the primary site of spatial perception. With a camera strapped to my body I encounter waterfalls. From these encounters, the sensations of shattered water are cultivated and reformed into cast plaster and concrete artifacts, deterritorializing the waterfalls from their physical location into affective material formations. These crafted artifacts are the distillation of my encounters with the shattering of water, extending {{the movement of the}} body through the landscape into the craft and navigation of architectural space. The process of translation created to test the potential of affective deterritorialization involves the technical mediums of photography, digital editing, computer modelling, Computer Numerical Control (CNC) routing <b>and</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> to develop the sensuous cast surfaces.
