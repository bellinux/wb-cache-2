40|$|The fine {{structure}} {{of more than}} 20 marine pseudomonads and more than 15 achromobacters was examined. Under the conditions extant, clear differences between members of these two groups were seen. The pseudomonads displayed the characteristic gram-negative morphology: the cell wall was irregularly undulant and the cytoplasmic membrane more nearly planar, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles were loosely packed throughout {{the periphery of the}} cytoplasm, and the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was axially disposed. Cell division appeared to be by constriction. Some strains characteristically produced evaginations or blebs of the cell wall. Occasionally, thick, <b>densely</b> <b>stained</b> ring structures were seen which are possibly analogous to mesosomes. In contrast, the achromobacters demonstrated a regularly undulant outer cell wall element and a planar inner wall. The cytoplasmic membrane was thin and not readily observed. RNP particles were <b>densely</b> <b>stained</b> and tightly packed in the cytoplasm; the DNA was most often lobate in disposition. Cellular division was mediated by the formation of a septum which consisted of the cytoplasmic membrane and the inner element of the cell wall. Mesosomes were observed in all of the strains examined.

40|$|We present {{high-resolution}} maps of DNA methylation and H 3 K 4 di- and trimethylation of two entire chromosomes and two fully sequenced centromeres in rice (Oryza sativa) shoots and cultured cells. This analysis reveals combinatorial {{interactions between}} these epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure and gene expression. Cytologically <b>densely</b> <b>stained</b> heterochromatin had less H 3 K 4 me 2 and H 3 K 4 me 3 and more methylated DNA than the less <b>densely</b> <b>stained</b> euchromatin, whereas centromeres had a unique epigenetic composition. Most transposable elements had highly methylated DNA but no H 3 K 4 methylation, whereas {{more than half}} of protein-coding genes had both methylated DNA and di- and/or trimethylated H 3 K 4. Methylation of DNA but not H 3 K 4 was correlated with suppressed transcription. By contrast, when both DNA and H 3 K 4 were methylated, transcription was only slightly reduced. Transcriptional activity was positively correlated with the ratio of H 3 K 4 me 3 /H 3 K 4 me 2 : genes with predominantly H 3 K 4 me 3 were actively transcribed, whereas genes with predominantly H 3 K 4 me 2 were transcribed at moderate levels. More protein-coding genes contained all three modifications, and more transposons contained DNA methylation in shoots than cultured cells. Differential epigenetic modifications correlated to tissue-specific expression between shoots and cultured cells. Collectively, this study provides insights into the ric...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{ultrastructure}} of the blepharoplast and the multilayered structure (MLS) in the fern Osmunda cinnamomea var. asiatica Fernald {{have been}} studied by electron microscopy with respect to spermatogenesis. The blepharoplast appears in the young spermatid. The differentiating blepharoplast is approximately a spherical body, which is composed of <b>densely</b> <b>stained</b> granular material {{in the center and}} some cylinders outside of it. The differentiated blepharoplast is also a sphere, but without the <b>densely</b> <b>stained</b> material in the center, consisting of scattered or radially arranged cylinders. The MLS seen in the spermatid lies between the basal bodies and the giant mitochondrion. In the early developmental stage, the MLS only consists of lamellar layers, each of which runs parallel to one another and forms a strip. In the mid stage, the MLS is composed of the microtubular ribbon (MTr), the lamellar layers and a layer of plaque. In the late stage, the MLS forms accessory band, osmiophilic crest and a layer of osmiophilic material. The MTr grows out from the MLS and extends along the surface of the nucleus to unite with the nuclear envelope in a complex. The basal body coming from the cylinder produces the axoneme of the flagella in the distal end and the wedge-shaped structure in the proximal end, respectively. In the present study, the ultrastructural features of blepharoplast and the MLS of the protoleptosporangiopsida fern, O. cinnamomea var. asiatica, have been described and compared with those of other kinds of pteridophytes in detail.

40|$|Light and {{electron}} microscope studies {{were carried out}} on the metrial gland cells of deciduomata of pseudopregnancy in the rat. At the light microscope level these cells were characterised by a comparatively pale staining cytoplasm with numerous glycoprotein granules. Some also had extensive cytoplasmic deposits of glycogen. In electron micrographs the metrial gland cell cytoplasm as a whole was much less electron-dense than that of fibroblasts and decidual cells, but it contained <b>densely</b> <b>stained</b> pleomorphic granules. There were stacks of rough endoplasmic reticulum, oval or round profiles of fibroblasts and decidual cells, but it contained <b>densely</b> <b>stained</b> pleomorphic granules. There were stacks of rough endoplasmic reticulum, oval or round profiles of mitochondria, and an extensive Golgi network. The metrial gland cells were roughly spherical in appearance, with irregular surface projections. In all these features, and in the sequence of their appearance, first in the decidua basalis, and later in the mesometrial triangle, the granulated metrial gland cells of deciduomata resembled the metrial gland cells of pregnancy. In addition to granulated metrial gland cells, decidual cells and fibroblasts, a number of other cell types were identified. These cells could be placed in a series, with each member of the series minimally different in morphological appearances from its neighbours. It is proposed that the series represents the differentiation of granulated metrial gland cells, in situ, from lymphocyte-like cells. The differentiation from a lymphocyte precursor appears to follow a sequence in deciduomata formation similar to that previously described in pregnancy...|$|R
5|$|The {{nucleolus}} is {{a discrete}} <b>densely</b> <b>stained</b> structure {{found in the}} nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a suborganelle. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.|$|R

No roots associated with the kinetosome have been observed. In many zoospores, the nucleus lies partially within the aggregation of ribosomes and was invariably situated laterally.
