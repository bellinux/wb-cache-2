30|$|The {{meantime}} {{needed to}} achieve union <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study</b> (10.4  ±  1.2  weeks) {{is similar to that}} reported by Ozdemir et al. [17], but less than that reported by other studies [4, 11, 20] (12 – 16  weeks). The mean age of patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study</b> is lower than those of the three aforementioned studies. In addition, patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study</b> were encouraged to weight-bear fully as early as possible. This may account for the rapid union rate achieved.|$|R
30|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study,</b> spinal {{traction}} {{was added}} to medical treatment which alone {{was not enough to}} control patients’ symptoms and which was not changed during traction.

30|$|From the above, we can {{conclude}} <b>the</b> following: (1) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study,</b> {{we found no}} false negatives. We therefore believe that PRMC {{has the ability to}} reject a suspected PCD diagnosis with great certainty, when used in daily clinical work up (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> 2 / 3 of referred patients). (2) PRMC has the ability to find candidates for further work up. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study,</b> 40  % of patients with an abnormal PRMC test ended up having PCD as final clinical diagnosis. This number will of course depend greatly upon the group of patients being investigated. (3) PRMC has a high rate of conclusive results (90  % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study).</b> (4) <b>In</b> addition, our results indicate {{that there might be a}} need for reference material for children.|$|R
