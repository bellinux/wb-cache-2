40|$|Electrochemical {{measurements}} employing ac and dc {{techniques as}} well as atomic force microscopy were used to study the electrochemical corrosion behavior of <b>ingot</b> <b>iron</b> with two different microstructures: conventional polycrystalline <b>ingot</b> <b>iron</b> (CPII) and bulk nanocrystalline <b>ingot</b> <b>iron</b> (BNII) fabricated from CPII by severe rolling, without and with inhibitors. The corrosive media was 0. 1 M H 2 SO 4 solution, while thiourea (TU) was employed as inhibitor, with a concentration of 5. 0 mM, {{as well as}} a 1 : 1 combination of TU and KI. Impedance and polarization results show that BNII was more susceptible to corrosion in the uninhibited acid. The presence of TU improved the corrosion resistance of both specimens comparably, while KI reduced the inhibition efficiency of TU. Infrared spectrophotometry revealed that the interfacial species for CPII and BNII in the presence of TU were quite identical and markedly different from that in TU + KI. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to illustrate the adsorption process of TU at a molecular level, and the theoretical predictions showed good agreement with the electrochemical results. 1...|$|E

30|$|Bulk nanocrystalline <b>ingot</b> <b>iron</b> {{had less}} linear thermal {{expansion}} in comparison with conventional polycrystalline <b>ingot</b> <b>iron</b> from liquid nitrogen temperature to 300 K. The thermal expansion depends on the interaction potential energy of atoms and the first partial derivative of it with respect to temperature, grain boundary structure, and residual strain, etc. Different preparation techniques of bulk nanocrystalline metal materials can result in different microstructures associated with thermal expansion. We can rule out the larger contribution of grain boundary and residual strain to {{linear thermal expansion}} for BNII. The porosity free at BNII grain boundary results in the less contribution of higher volume fraction and residual strain to thermal expansion of BNII. Linear thermal expansion of many NC materials was {{higher than those of}} their conventional coarse polycrystalline counterparts because the expansion velocity of the porosity at the grain boundary is larger than the expansion velocity of atoms inside crystallite and at grain boundary.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{corrosion}} and corrosion {{inhibition of}} bulk nanocrystalline <b>ingot</b> <b>iron</b> (BNII) fabricated from conven-tional polycrystalline <b>ingot</b> <b>iron</b> (CPII) by severe rolling was studied in 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization techniques. The {{results indicate that}} BNII was more susceptible to corrosion in the acidic environment essen-tially because {{of an increase in}} the kinetics of the anodic reaction. An amino acid cysteine (cys) was employed as a corrosion inhibitor at concentrations of 0. 001 and 0. 005 M. Tests in inhibited solutions revealed that cys reduced the corrosion rates of both metal specimens by different mechanisms. For CPII cys inhibited the cathodic reaction but had a stimulating effect on the anodic process at low concentration and a trivial effect at higher concentration. For BNII, cys inhibited both the cathodic and the anodic reactions, although the former effect was more pronounced. Iodide ions improved the inhibitive effect of cys without altering the inhibition mechanism...|$|E

30|$|The linear thermal {{expansions}} (LTE) of bulk nanocrystalline <b>ingot</b> <b>iron</b> (BNII) at six {{directions on}} rolling plane and conventional polycrystalline <b>ingot</b> <b>iron</b> (CPII) at one direction were measured from liquid nitrogen temperature to 300 K. Although the volume fraction of grain boundary and residual strain of BNII {{are larger than}} those of CPII, LTE of BNII at the six measurement directions were less than those of CPII. This phenomenon could be explained with Morse potential function and the crystalline structure of metals. Our LTE results ruled out that the grain boundary and residual strain of BNII did much contribution to its thermal expansion. The higher interaction potential energy of atoms, the less partial derivative of interaction potential energy with respect to temperature T and the porosity free at the grain boundary of BNII resulted in less LTE in comparison with CPII from liquid nitrogen temperature to 300 K. The higher LTE of many bulk nanocrystalline materials resulted from the porosity at their grain boundaries. However, many authors attributed the higher LTE of many nanocrystalline metal materials to their higher volume fraction of grain boundaries.|$|E

In contrast to recent work, the slip was found to occur on wavy surfaces rather than pairs of crystallographic planes. Fatigue cracks were found to follow surfaces of high shear stress containing a direction. The conclusion that fatigue failures are primarily shear failures is strengthened by a statistical explanation of the mechanism by which a microscopic shear failure {{can lead to the}} apparent tension failure commonly observed in rotary bending tests on polycrystalline iron.

The permeation rate in steels also decreases as the carbon content increases. As a consequence of Sievert's law, the computed hydrogen solubility decreases as the carbon content increases. This decreases in explained in terms of hydrogen trapping at carbide interfaces. Oxidizing and nitriding the surfaces of alpha-titanium membranes result in a decrease in the permeation rate for such treatment on the gas inlet surfaces but resulted in a slight increase in the rate for such treatment on the gas outlet surfaces.

It was also found that ground coats containing 3. 2 weight percent or more of cobalt oxide developed a weak but definite bond in oxygen concentra-tions as low as 0. 02 mole percent but that, when lower amounts of cobalt oxide were present in the enamel, a greater oxygen concentration in the furnace atmosphere was necessary for appreciable bond development. When 2. 0 percent of manganese dioxide was added to an enamel con-taining 0. 4 weight percent cobalt oxide, the effect was small, but the trend was toward increased adherence. Metallographic examinations of the interfaces of the various speci-mens tested showed a qualitative correlation between adherence and sur-face roughness regardless of the oxygen content of the firing atmosphere.

40|$|First {{published}} online June 14, 2017 Background: Anemia affects 45 % {{of women}} of childbearing age in Cambodia. Iron supplementation is recommended in populations in which anemia prevalence is high. However, there are issues of cost, distribution, and adherence. A potential alternative is a reusable fish-shaped <b>iron</b> <b>ingot,</b> which, when added to the cooking pot, leaches iron into the fluid in which it is prepared. Objective: We sought to determine whether there was a difference in hemoglobin concentrations in rural Cambodian anemic women (aged 18 - 49 y) who cooked with the <b>iron</b> <b>ingot</b> or consumed a daily iron supplement compared with a control after 1 y. Design: In Preah Vihear, 340 women with mild or moderate anemia were randomly assigned to 1) an iron-ingot group, 2) an iron-supplement (18 mg/d) group, or 3) a nonplacebo control group. A venous blood sample was taken at baseline and at 6 and 12 mo. Blood was analyzed for hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and serum transferrin receptor. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was used to detect structural hemoglobin variants. Results: Anemia prevalence was 44 % {{with the use of a}} portable hemoglobinometer during screening. At baseline, prevalence of iron deficiency was 9 % on the basis of a low serum ferritin concentration. There was no significant difference in mean hemoglobin concentrations between the iron-ingot group (115 g/L; 95 % CI: 113, 118 g/L; P = 0. 850) or iron-supplement group (115 g/L; 95 % CI: 113, 117 g/L; P = 0. 998) compared with the control group (115 g/L; 95 % CI: 113, 117 g/L) at 12 mo. Serum ferritin was significantly higher in the iron-supplement group (73 μg/L; 95 % CI: 64, 82 μg/L; P = 0. 002) than in the control group at 6 mo; however, this significance was not maintained at 12 mo (73 μg/L; 95 % CI: 58, 91 μg/L; P = 0. 176). Conclusions: Neither the <b>iron</b> <b>ingot</b> nor <b>iron</b> supplements increased hemoglobin concentrations in this population at 6 or 12 mo. We do not recommend the use of the fish-shaped <b>iron</b> <b>ingot</b> in Cambodia or in countries where the prevalence of iron deficiency is low and genetic hemoglobin disorders are high.
