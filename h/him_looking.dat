5|$|In 1984, Sinatra {{worked with}} Quincy Jones {{for the first}} time in nearly two decades on the album, L.A. Is My Lady, which was well {{received}} critically. The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with Lena Horne, which had to be abandoned. In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and was hospitalized for diverticulitis, which left <b>him</b> <b>looking</b> frail. Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis, Jr. and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played a number of large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift developed between them and the two never spoke again.|$|E
5|$|An 86th-minute {{equaliser}} from McBreen gave York a 1–1 draw {{at home to}} Salisbury City, which {{maintained the}} team's unbeaten record at Bootham Crescent. Parslow signed a new contract with the club, and Rotherham midfielder Peter Holmes joined on a one-month loan. A second defeat of the season came after losing 2–0 away to Kidderminster, Brian Smikle and Justin Richards scoring for the home team. Beadle was released by the club {{towards the end of}} his loan spell at Whitby, due to <b>him</b> <b>looking</b> for regular first-team football. This was followed by the departure of Bore, who returned to Grimsby from his loan spell early. A 3–3 draw away against Stevenage was achieved after the team were 2–0 down after 19 minutes, with the York goals coming from Sodje, Holmes and Farrell. Sodje picked up a hamstring injury during this match, meaning he would be out of action for four to six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Sol quickly {{falls for}} Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. Sol {{has never met}} a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen said {{that there is something}} about Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on <b>him.</b> <b>Looking</b> after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so {{he did not have to}} act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E

There was more meaning in what he said than he knew of, or he wouldn't have had brains enough to say it. Let <b>him</b> <b>look</b> to it; let <b>him</b> <b>look</b> to it!

5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on <b>him.</b> <b>Looking</b> after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E

After resurfacing he filled his tanks at the dive shop, a transaction recorded on security cameras (it is not known what he filled those tanks with). He spent {{much of the rest of}} the afternoon by himself alongside the spring, witnesses said, testing equipment and making notes in his dive log.|$|E

500|$|... "Percy the Rat Catcher" [...] {{received}} overdubs across five studio {{sessions and}} then was mixed in late June, eventually being given the name [...] "Lucifer Sam". Songwriting {{for the majority of}} the album is credited solely to Barrett, with tracks such as [...] "Bike" [...] having been written in late 1966 before the album was started. [...] "Bike" [...] was recorded on 21 May 1967 and originally entitled [...] "The Bike Song". By June, Barrett's increasing LSD use during the recording project left <b>him</b> <b>looking</b> visibly debilitated.|$|E
500|$|... "Cowboy Style" [...] {{was written}} by Minogue, Steve Anderson and Dave Seaman, {{and was one of}} the first songs {{composed}} for the album. Minogue wrote the song prior to being in a relationship with French photographer Stephane Sednaoui with different lyrical context, but it was completed while she was dating. Of the song, Minogue said [...] "the way you start a new relationship with someone, they can bring out so many emotions within you and makes you question yourself a bit more." [...] The title [...] "Cowboy Style" [...] comes from when she first met Sednaoui in person, where she recalled <b>him</b> <b>looking</b> [...] "unusual" [...] and felt like he was [...] "the new cowboy coming into town".|$|E
500|$|... "Ricardio the Heart Guy" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Bert Youn and Sean Jimenez, from {{a story by}} Merriwether Williams, Tim McKeon, and Adam Muto. Directed by Larry Leichliter, the episode {{introduces}} the recurring villain Ricardio, played by George Takei, a character that Tom Kenny later called [...] "the valentine from Hell". Takei later reprised the role in the season four episode [...] "Lady and Peebles". Initial drafts of the character featured <b>him</b> <b>looking</b> more like an anthropomorphic heart, complete with arteries and ventricles. Ricardio {{is one of the}} few individuals in the Adventure Time universe to have a highly detailed face; during the commentary for the episode, his design was compared to that of the face on the moon in the 1902 French silent film Le Voyage dans la Lune, based on H.G. Wells's 1901 novel The First Men in the Moon.|$|E

500|$|Had Cagney's {{mother had}} her way, his stage career {{would have ended}} when he quit Every Sailor after two months; proud as she was of his performance, she {{preferred}} that he get an education. Cagney appreciated the $35 a week he was paid, which he called [...] "a mountain of money for me in those worrisome days." [...] In deference to his mother's worries, he got employment as a brokerage house runner. This did not stop <b>him</b> <b>looking</b> for more stage work, however, {{and he went on}} to successfully audition for a chorus part in the William B. Friedlander musical Pitter Patter, for which he earned $55 a week—he sent $40 to his mother each week. So strong was his habit of holding down more than one job at a time, he also worked as a dresser for one of the leads, portered the casts' luggage, and understudied for the lead. Among the chorus line performers was 16-year-old Frances Willard [...] "Billie" [...] Vernon, whom he married in 1922.|$|E
500|$|The {{special effects}} and makeup {{departments}} {{are also important}} assets to production. Dean has an out-of-body experience in [...] "In My Time of Dying", and some scenes feature <b>him</b> <b>looking</b> at his own body in a hospital bed. To forgo the use of visual effects, the special effects department sculpted a full gelatin face from Ackles, and applied it to a body double. To depict a woman burning {{to death in the}} episode [...] "Simon Said", the actress was sealed inside a full body silicone designed to look like her, and was doused with fire accelerant. She was required to breathe through a straw, as well as don underwear soaked in ice-cold fire-retardant gel. Prior to [...] "Heart", Kripke had not wanted to include werewolves in the series, as he felt that the budget would only allow for [...] "a guy with fur glued to his face". As he prefers to have monsters be able to walk among humans, production made the transformation subtle—the character's eyes change, and her canine teeth and fingernails grow. However, writer Sera Gamble believes that they [...] "dropped the ball" [...] in the design, feeling that the creature looked too similar to a vampire.|$|E
500|$|In the {{vicinity}} of Saint-Quentin on 2October, No.2 Squadron became the first AFC unit in Europe to see aerial combat when one of its patrols engaged some German two-seaters, which managed to escape. Because the AircoDH.5s in the squadron were handicapped as fighters by engine problems and low speed, the squadron was employed mainly in ground support duties. During the Battle of Cambrai that commenced on 20November 1917, Watt led his pilots on daring low-level bombing and strafing attacks against enemy fortifications and lines of communication. Their loss rate reached 30%, but morale remained high. After visiting the squadron, the Royal Flying Corps' Major General Hugh Trenchard described its airmen as [...] "really magnificent" [...] while Charles Bean, war correspondent and future editor of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, commented on their [...] "remarkably high level of conduct and general tone". Six of Watt's officers were awarded the Military Cross for gallantry during the battle, prompting General Sir William Birdwood to send him a personal message of congratulation on 16December, declaring: [...] "...This is indeed a magnificent record for your squadron, and one of which I am sure everyone of you must rightly be extremely proud; I doubt if it has been beaten anywhere..." [...] By this time, No.2 Squadron had begun converting to Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, though it could achieve little in the winter months due to inclement weather. Watt himself, now almost forty, was beginning to show the strain of frontline command. Bean found <b>him</b> <b>looking</b> [...] "very worn" [...] and noticed him shivering even while seated {{in front of the}} mess hall fire.|$|E

500|$|Irvine {{argued that}} though all of Austen's novels {{are set in}} provincial England, there {{is in fact a}} global {{component}} to her stories with the British Empire as a place where men go off in adventures, to get rich and to tell stories which edify the heroines. Irvine used as examples the naval career of Captain Wentworth in Persuasion; that Sir Thomas Bertram owes a plantation in Antigua while William Price joins the Royal Navy in Mansfield Park; and Colonel Brandon is a veteran of the campaigns in the West Indies in Sense and Sensibility. Irvine observed that all of these men are in some way improved by the love of women, who domestic otherwise scarred men, noting that for example that Colonel Brandon had fought in the British campaign to conquer Saint-Domingue, where the British lost about 100,000 men between 1793-98, mostly to yellow fever, an experience that scarred him and left <b>him</b> <b>looking</b> for a [...] "home". Irvine argued that Elinor Dashwood by arranging for Colonel Brandon to marry her sister Marianne is finding for him the [...] "home" [...] that he had lost while fighting for the British empire in a doomed effort to restore slavery to Saint-Domingue. Irvine suggested that for Austen, women had a role in domesticating men scarred by their imperial experiences, and that Said was wrong that Austen could [...] "not" [...] write of the British empire; arguing instead in Austen's works the [...] "stories of empire" [...] are placed in a [...] "context of their telling that domesticates them, removes them from the political and moral realm where the horrors they describe might demand a moral and political response".|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{selected}} as [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] in the Sunday Age, where Michael Gordon wrote: [...] "This is not the whole story, {{but it is a}} well-researched and superbly presented summary of the story so far – a kind of companion to the John Lennon book, 'Imagine' – including the temper tantrums. Fans may, however, disagree with the closing assessment that Morrison may be running out of themes and ideas to express." [...] Publishers Weekly was critical of the book's tone, commenting: [...] "Turner is more adulatory than probing." [...] The review noted: [...] "A complete discography makes this book a necessity for fans of the Irish Rover." [...] Writing for The Boston Globe, Thomas C. Palmer Jr. called the book [...] "a coffee-table biography that fills an extensive void, both for those hungry for gossip and for those who have wondered at the source of the creativity in this prolific producer of often stunningly original – if difficult to categorize – music". Palmer commented on the book's value: [...] "The value of the book is that it has at its heart the same subjects that most of Morrison's music has featured, subtly or otherwise (but never as blatantly as Dylan in his [...] "Saved" [...] period): religion and spirituality." [...] Robert Sandall reviewed the book for The Sunday Times, and wrote: [...] "Steve Turner has performed his task as a biographer diligently enough in Too Late To Stop Now, but the really interesting story here is told by the photographs." [...] Sandall commented: [...] "Thirty years of constant rowing with anybody who has ever tried to get close to him, and a fitful and irritable hankering after religion (any religion) have left <b>him</b> <b>looking</b> bloated, sad and, as Turner has the courage and decency to point out, not as great a musician now as his current reputation would suggest. It's all there in the pictures." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{the first}} season, where the Wachowskis and Straczynski split {{the amount of}} scripts in half and worked {{remotely}} from each other (but with frequent meetings), writing for the second season was performed by Lana and Straczynski by collaborating inside a shared writers' room. The author of Cloud Atlas David Mitchell and the novelist and columnist Aleksandar Hemon worked as additional writers on the second season and were credited as [...] "consultants"; they also made a cameo appearance in an episode as themselves. Both writers came to know {{and work with the}} Wachowskis prior to Sense8. Lana became friends with Mitchell after adapting Cloud Atlas to film with her sister and Tom Tykwer, and was very surprised to read Mitchell's The Bone Clocks shortly before shooting the first season of Sense8 to find it strongly resembled [...] "Sense8 and Jupiter Ascending [...] together", even though they each wrote their works separately. Hemon first met the Wachowskis in 2009, when they interviewed <b>him</b> <b>looking</b> for inspiration to write a movie script they wanted, and in turn he profiled them and wrote about the making of Cloud Atlas for The New Yorker in 2012. For the second season of Sense8, Mitchell and Hemon were brought in to spend a week in September 2015 with Lana, Straczynski, and script supervisor Julie Brown, proposing to them situations, twists and turns, to be further developed by Lana and Straczynski. Afterwards {{and for the rest of}} the year, Mitchell and Hemon were regularly being tasked by Lana to write from distance select scenes on short deadlines, that she and Straczynski would further develop or reject. Hemon estimates he delivered around 120 pages, of which none made it to the second season's 700-paged script without changes. Later, once filming began, Lana did a lot of rewrites on a daily basis as she got inspired by the locations, actors, and so on, even on the set.|$|E
