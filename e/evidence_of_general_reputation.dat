[...] In these models of the pure heroic drama, the ruling sentiments of love and honour are carried to the most passionate extravagance. And, to maintain the legitimacy of this style of composition, our author, ever ready to vindicate with his pen to be right, that which his timid critics murmured at as wrong, threw the gauntlet down before the admirers of the ancient English school, in the Epilogue to the [...] "Second Part of the Conquest of Granada," [...] and in the Defence of that Epilogue. That these plays might be introduced to the public with a solemnity corresponding in all respects to models of the rhyming tragedy, they were inscribed to the Duke of York, and prefaced by an [...] "Essay upon Heroic Plays." [...] They were performed in 1669-70, and received with unbounded applause. Before we consider the effect which they, and similar productions, produced on the public, together with the progress and decay of the taste for heroic dramas, we may first notice the effect which the ascendency of our author's reputation had produced upon his situation and fortunes.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the in vivo {{corrosion}} resistance of the implanted titanium, nitinol annular occlusion device to a control device, i. e. an implantable device containing nitinol, approved by the FDA and currently on the market. Methods: The annular occlusion device is a self-closing, implantable clip. Three canines un-derwent placement of devices on the left and right atrial appendages. Two Vnus U-clips were secured to either atrium. On post-operative day 95, animals underwent en-bloc cardiac resection via the previous left thoracotomy incision. The annular occlusion device and U-clips were dissected free from the atria. The polyester fabric and tissue ingrowth were removed from the devices and were sent for corrosion analysis. Results: Gross examination of resected hearts of two canines revealed no abnormalities. The compressed endocardial surfaces were completely fused and the appendages fully necrosed. All devices were located and harvested. The annular occlusion device clips and Medtronic Vnus U-clips were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. Both low and high magnification examination of the nitinol springs and the site of insertion of the nitinol springs into the titanium tubes in the annular occlusion device showed no evi-dence of localized corrosion. In no case was any <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> or localized corrosion found in the form of metal-lic oxidation. Conclusion: The annular occlusion device provides safe and reliable exclusion of the left atrial appendage without <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>general</b> or localized corrosion over the 95 -day exposure period in canines and may therefore pro...|$|R
