5|$|King {{believed}} that organized, nonviolent {{protest against the}} system of southern segregation known as Jim Crow laws would lead to extensive {{media coverage of the}} struggle for black equality and voting rights. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily deprivation and indignities suffered by Southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights workers and marchers, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the Civil Rights Movement was the most <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> in American politics in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnam War (1955–1975) was an <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> {{on college}} campuses across the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. As a belated {{response}} to Vietnam War protesters who believed that funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) made the university part of the military–industrial complex, the Stanford Research Institute split from Stanford University in 1970. The organization subsequently changed {{its name from the}} Stanford Research Institute to SRI International in 1977.|$|E

I operationalize <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> as pre-decision {{salience}} and measure mentions {{of cases in}} the first section of two newspapers. The research shows that the Roberts Court has been hearing more <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> than the other modern Courts. I reason that the Roberts Court has been hearing more <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> because interest groups and individuals are turning to the Court to make policy. Because the Court is becoming a more important policymaking institution, scrutiny of the Supreme Court will increase...|$|R

5|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of electricity produced worldwide is used immediately, since storage is usually more expensive and because traditional generators can adapt to demand. However both solar power and wind power are variable renewable energy, meaning that all available output must be taken whenever it is available by moving through transmission lines to {{where it can be}} used now. Since solar energy is not available at night, storing its energy is potentially an <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> particularly in off-grid and for future 100% renewable energy scenarios to have continuous electricity availability.|$|E
5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E

He participated in the last Democratic Debate before the primary season on December 13 in Johnson, Iowa. In this debate sponsored by the Des Moines Register, Dodd commented that Education was the most <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> to him in the campaign. He also made a statement on why he felt he was the best choice for president and why he should receive the endorsement of the Des Moines Register, which ultimately went to Hillary Clinton.|$|E

5|$|Immigration {{became an}} <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> for the Vlaams Blok {{from the late}} 1980s. Interconnected with the Flemish {{nationalism}} issue, immigrants {{were considered to be}} a threat to the Flemish ethnic community. In 1992, the party established its 70-point plan, which included measures to stop all immigration, return most immigrants to their native countries by force, and legally discriminate against residing migrants in respect of markets such as labour, housing and education. The party's opponents particularly saw its immigration program as a source of claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years downplayed the relevance of the 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding immigration.|$|E
5|$|Monastic reform {{became an}} <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> during the 11th century, as elites {{began to worry}} that monks were not {{adhering}} to the rules binding them to a strictly religious life. Cluny Abbey, founded in the Mâcon region of France in 909, was established {{as part of the}} Cluniac Reforms, a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear. Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour. It sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen, thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords.|$|E
5|$|The Radiation Laboratory {{forwarded}} {{the preliminary}} designs for a production plant to Stone & Webster {{before the end}} of the year, but one <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> remained unsettled. Oppenheimer contended that weapons-grade uranium would have to be 90% pure uranium-235. Edward Lofgren and Martin Kamen thought that this could not be achieved without a second stage of enrichment. The two stages became known as Alpha and Beta. In March 1943, Groves approved the construction of five Alpha and two Beta racetracks. In September, he authorized four more Alpha racetracks, which became known as Alpha II, along with two more Beta racetracks to process their product.|$|E

5|$|Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, {{now turned}} its {{attention}} to the Klaipėda Region, then held by Lithuania. In April 1938, Hitler stated that control of the Port of Klaipėda (German: Memel) and its surrounding area was Germany's second-most <b>important</b> <b>issue,</b> following {{the status of the}} Sudeten area. In the event of armed hostilities between Poland and Lithuania, German troops were to defend and occupy the Klaipėda region and significant portions of western Lithuania. The Polish ambassador to Nazi Germany, Józef Lipski, was informed of these plans. The Poles agreed to cooperate with German troops and to respect German interests in Klaipėda if such an armed conflict were to arise. However, in Hitler's assessment, an immediate bid for Klaipėda was impolitic; he wished {{to maintain the status quo}} until more time had passed after the Anschluss. The German suggestion was that Lithuania concede to the Polish demands.|$|E
5|$|Up to 60,000 Italian {{volunteers were}} now {{operating}} in Spain, and {{the removal of}} foreign nationals was discussed by the Non-Intervention Committee. Italy had made a declaration that it would stop Italian volunteers from fighting in Spain on 7 January 1937, and put a moratorium on volunteers on 20 January, also agreeing to support limitations on the number of volunteers on the 25th. Italy continued to request that belligerent rights be given to the Nationalists and Republicans, so both would gain the right to search vessels for contraband, thus removing the need for naval patrols. This request was opposed by the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union. British recognition of Italian sovereignty over Abyssinia following the Second Italo-Abyssinian War was an <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> during Anglo-Italian discussions in August 1937. Following Eden's disagreement with Chamberlain and Lord Halifax, Leader of the House of Lords and influential politician, over the issue, any agreement recognising Italian sovereignty was postponed until after the planned shipping conference had taken place.|$|E
5|$|West Gate {{continued}} {{to be used as}} the city gaol, resulting in it surviving the destruction of the other city gates. When the reformer John Howard visited the gaol in the mid-1770s, he noted that it contained a large day room for male and female prisoners and two small night rooms, but no courtyard for exercise. Prison reform became an <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> during the early 19th century, and the West Gate gaol was considered unsatisfactory, being condemned as dirty, cramped and insecure, resulting in the extension of the gaol into Pound Lane and the consequent dismantling of the adjacent city wall. There was a legal attempt to demolish the West Gate altogether in 1859, in order to allow the Wombwell Circus to march a parade of elephants into the city; the gatehouse was only saved by the casting vote of Canterbury's mayor. In 1865 the prison was closed and the West Gate became used first for the storage of archives and then as a museum.|$|E
