25|$|Typically ABS {{includes}} a central {{electronic control unit}} (ECU), four wheel speed sensors, {{and at least two}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valves</b> within the brake hydraulics. The ECU constantly monitors the rotational speed of each wheel; if it detects the wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, a condition indicative of impending wheel lock, it actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the affected wheel, thus reducing the braking force on that wheel; the wheel then turns faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel is increased so the braking force is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply or release braking pressure 15 times per second. Because of this, the wheels of cars equipped with ABS are practically impossible to lock even during panic braking in extreme conditions.|$|E
500|$|The {{sinking of}} the Venetian house at {{the climax of the}} film {{featured}} the largest rig ever built for a Bond film. For the scene involving Bond following Vesper into the house undergoing renovation supported by inflatable balloons, a tank was constructed at the 007 stage at Pinewood, consisting of a Venetian piazza and the interior of the three-story dilapidated house. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated electronics with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valves</b> which were closely controlled by computer because of the dynamic movement within the system on its two axes. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model which the effects team built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model elevator within the rig could be immersed in [...] of water, and used banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement.|$|E

Two multimode Bragg grating sensors were fabricated in 62 / 125 m graded-index silica multimode fiber; the first sensor was produced by the holographic method and the second sensor by the phase mask technique. The sensors have signal reflectivity of approximately 35 % at peak wavelengths of 835 nm and 859 nm, respectively. Strain testing of both sensors has been done from 0 to 1000 and the temperature testing from 40 to 80 C. Strain and temperature sensitivity values are 0. 55 pm and 6 pm C, respectively.
