25|$|With a {{chain drive}} transmission, a {{chainring}} {{attached to a}} crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) (cassette or freewheel). There are four gearing options: two-speed <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{transmissions}} {{have been}} demonstrated and marketed for both derailleur and <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> mechanisms, often accompanied by a warning to disengage auto-shifting if standing on the pedals. These have met with limited market success.|$|E
25|$|The {{overlapping}} ranges with {{derailleur gears}} mean that 24 or 27 speed derailleur gears may {{only have the}} same total gear range as a (much more expensive) Rohloff 14-speed <b>hub</b> <b>gear.</b> Internal hub geared bikes typically have a more restricted gear range than comparable derailleur-equipped bikes, and have fewer ratios within that range.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hub</b> <b>gears</b> can be {{manufactured}} {{to include a}} coaster brake (though not all <b>hub</b> <b>gears</b> are available with coaster brakes). This is not possible with derailleur systems, because the chain cannot transmit a backwards pull.|$|R

50|$|In 1937 Ferris' Raleigh bicycle was {{equipped}} with Lauterwasser handlebars, and Sturmey Archer AR close ratio, three-speed <b>hub</b> <b>gears,</b> and latterly. the newly invented Raleigh Dynohub. This was the last Land's End to John O'Groats record that was set with <b>hub</b> <b>gears</b> rather than derailleur gears.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} to chaindrive {{is to use}} a synchronous belt. These are toothed and work much the same as a chain - popular with commuters and long distance cyclists they require little maintenance. They can't be shifted across a cassette of sprockets, and are used either as single speed or with a <b>hub</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gear {{ranges of}} almost 700% can be {{achieved}} on derailleur setups, though this may result in some rather large steps between gears or some awkward gear changes. However, through the careful choice of chainrings and rear cogsets, e.g. 3 chainrings 48-34-20 and a 10-speed cassette 11-32, one can achieve an extremely wide range of gears that are still well spaced. This sort of setup has proven useful on a multitude of bicycles such as cargo bikes, touring bikes and tandems. Even higher gear ranges {{can be achieved}} by using a 2-speed bottom bracket <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> in conjunction with suitable derailleurs.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hub</b> <b>gears</b> {{are sealed}} within the hub, which protects them from water, grit, and impacts. Thus <b>hub</b> <b>gears</b> usually require less {{maintenance}} {{and can be}} more reliable over time than comparable external derailleur gear systems, which may require more adjustments and replacement of parts (front chainrings, rear sprockets, narrow derailleur-chain).|$|R

2500|$|In 1893, BSA {{commenced}} making bicycle hubs {{and continued}} to supply the cycle trade with bicycle parts up to 1936. BSA bought The Eadie Manufacturing Company of Redditch in 1907 and so began to manufacture the Eadie two speed <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> and the Eadie coaster brake hub. BSA also {{signed an agreement with}} the Three Speed Gear Syndicate in 1907 to manufacture a 3 speed hub under licence. [...] This was later classified as the Sturmey Archer Type X. BSA introduced a 'Duo' hub in the late 1930s which was capable of one fixed gear and one gear with a freewheel. [...] All BSA <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> production temporarily ceased in 1939, until they recommenced making their 3 speed hub around 1945. The Eadie coaster hub made a brief return in 1953 on two BSA bicycle models. BSA forever ceased production of their hub gears in 1955.|$|E

2500|$|One {{standard}} {{option for the}} Brompton folding bicycle {{is to use a}} 3-speed <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> (roughly a 30% difference between gear ratios) in combination with a 2-speed deraileur gear (roughly a 15% difference) to give 6 distinct gear ratios; {{this is an example of}} half-step gearing. [...] Some Brompton suppliers offer a 2-speed chainring 'Mountain Drive' as well, which results in 12 distinct gear ratios with a range exceeding 5:1; in this case, the change from 6th to 7th gear involves changing all three sets of gears simultaneously.|$|E
2500|$|Coaster-brake {{bicycles}} {{are generally}} {{equipped with a}} single cog and chain wheel and often use ⅛ in (3.2mm) wide chain. [...] However, {{there have been several}} models of coaster brake hubs with dérailleurs, such as the Sachs 2x3. These use special extra-short dérailleurs which can stand up to the forces of being straightened out frequently and do not require an excessive amount of reverse pedal rotation before the brake engages. Coaster brakes have also been incorporated into <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> designs - for example the AWC and SRC3 from Sturmey-Archer, and the Shimano Nexus 3-speed. They can have up to eight gears, like the Nexus inter-8.|$|E
2500|$|BSA {{manufactured}} a {{range of}} bicycles from utility roadsters through to racing bicycles. The BSA range of Sports bicycles expanded in the 1930s following the granting of a patent for a new lighter design of seat lug in 1929 and tandems were introduced into the BSA bicycle range as well. BSA {{had a reputation for}} quality and durability and their components were more expensive that either Chater-Lea or Brampton. [...] BSA launched a high end club cyclists machine in the early 1930s initially branded as the [...] "Super-eeze". Never slow to avail of publicity BSA sponsored the great Australian cyclist Hubert Opperman [...] and re-branded the top of the range machine the [...] "Opperman" [...] model. [...] A less expensive range of clubman lightweight machines was introduced from 1936 with the [...] "Cyclo" [...] 3 speed derailleur equipped [...] "Clubman". Subtle changes were made to the range, most models being equipped with [...] "Russ" [...] patent forks [...] and some models were made for only two seasons. This all stopped around September 1939 with the outbreak of war. A revised catalogue with a much reduced range was issued in March 1940 which also saw the launch of the BSA [...] "Streamlight" [...] model. [...] A novel all white bicycle [...] was produced for the blackout but had disappeared from a severely reduced bicycle range the details of which were circulated to dealers from December 1941. BSA had ceased production of their 3 speed <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> in 1939 and production appears to have started again by 1945 although with a black finish instead of chromium plating. [...] BSA bought Sunbeam in 1943 and produced Sunbeam bicycles using up existing frames and parts and using BSA components for the missing bits. [...] The first BSA produced Sunbeam catalogue was published in 1949 ...|$|E

25|$|Less {{common is}} the use of a double or triple {{chainring}} in conjunction with an internally <b>geared</b> <b>hub,</b> extending the <b>gear</b> range without having to fit multiple sprockets to the hub.

50|$|Inventive as ever, in 1921 Henry Sturmey applied {{successfully}} {{for a patent}} on a five-speed <b>hub</b> <b>gear.</b> It was more advanced than any other <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> then available but {{he was unable to}} find a manufacturer willing to produce it.

5000|$|A <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> is an {{important}} feature of a European city bike. A <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> system provides greater ease-of-use [...] than a derailleur system, can provide {{a wide range of}} ratios, and requires little maintenance.|$|E

50|$|Hub gearing {{permits the}} use of a fully {{enclosed}} chaincase, which minimizes the need for maintenance. A <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> has lower efficiency than a clean, properly adjusted derailleur system, but retains its efficiency without conscientious cleaning and adjustment. A <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> system is heavier than a derailleur system. In a <b>hub</b> <b>gear</b> system, the main moving parts are enclosed, making repair more difficult than with a derailleur system. If a geared hub fails, it is sometimes more economical to replace the hub than attempt to repair it.|$|E

25|$|Internal gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} gears {{involved}} are hidden within a wheel <b>hub.</b> <b>Hub</b> <b>gears</b> work using internal planetary, or epicyclic, gearing which alters {{the speed of the}} hub casing and wheel relative to the speed of the drive sprocket. They have just a single chainring and a single rear sprocket, almost always with a straight chain path between the two. <b>Hub</b> <b>gears</b> are available with between 2 and 14 speeds; weight and price tend to increase with the number of gears. All the advertised speeds are available as distinct gear ratios controlled by a single shifter (except for some early 5-speed models which used two shifters). <b>Hub</b> <b>gearing</b> is often used for bicycles intended for city-riding and commuting.|$|R
