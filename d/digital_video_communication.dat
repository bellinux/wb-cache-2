40|$|In a <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>communication,</b> the encoder {{can play}} a very {{important}} role on what can be achieved at the decoder side in terms of error processing. To behave in the best way, {{it is important that the}} encoder try to foresee the difficulties that the decoder will face dealing with errors and work to help it, notably in the most critical moments. In particular, if the encoder evaluates how difficult certain errors are to conceal, it will be able to better decide the amount of error resilience overhead to be used and where. This evaluation at the encoder may be done by considering the video data being encoded and the coding scheme being used. When object-based video coding schemes such as the one specified by the MPEG- 4 standard are considered, channel errors can affect both the shape and texture data, which can be concealed using spatial and/or temporal techniques. In this paper, a spatial shape concealment difficulty measure based on an MPEG- 7 descriptor is proposed, with the target to allow the encoder to control the amount of intra-coding refreshment to be used for the shape information in order to improve the concealment performance at the decoder.

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure {{compatibility}} among video codecs from different manufacturers and applications and to simplify {{the development of new}} applications, intensive efforts have been undertaken in recent years to define digital video standards Over the past decades, digital video compression technologies have {{become an integral part of}} the way we create, communicate and consume visual information. <b>Digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>communication</b> can be found today in many application sceneries such as broadcast services over satellite and terrestrial channels, digital video storage, wires and wireless conversational services and etc. The data quantity is very large for the digital video and the memory of the storage devices and the bandwidth of the transmission channel are not infinite, so it is not practical for us to store the full digital video without processing. For instance, we have a 720 x 480 pixels per frame, 30 frames per second, total 90 minutes full color video, then the full data quantity of this video is about 167. 96 G bytes. Thus, several video compression standards, techniques and algorithms had been developed to reduce the data quantity and provide the acceptable quality as possible as can. Thus they often represent an optimal compromise between performance and complexity.

40|$|A <b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Communication</b> System {{consists}} of a video encoder, a channel through which the video is transmitted and finally a video decoder. These three phases can cause different kinds of impairments or degradations {{in the quality of}} a video. One of the degradations that takes place due to an error prone channel is frame freezing and it affects the quality of a video. Frame freezing is a phenomenon in which a particular frame is repeated (displayed) for {{a certain period of time}} until the next correct frame is received hence producing a pause or a freeze in a video sequence. Frame freezing can be single or multiple depending on the channel characteristics. Research is being conducted in order to devise a metric which can help in quantifying a video sequence on the basis of its quality. Researchers design metrics and then using their mathematical models, they compare their results with subjective measurements. Subjective measurements help in telling the preciseness and correctness of the metric that whether the quality assessment metric is close enough to subjective test measurements. In this report, three metrics used for video quality assessment have been studied and compared mathematically as well as by careful experiments. The three metrics, chosen for this study, work on No Reference (NR) method for judging the quality of a video. Subjective tests have been performed keeping in view of the recommendations of ITU (International Telecommunication Union). After the study of these three metrics, their advantages and disadvantages over each other have been discussed and the metric that performs the best under certain conditions has been proposed. Finally, a conclusion has been made for the metric that performs the best and also for the metric that performs the worse or even does not perform at all under certain conditions.

40|$|Nobody {{really knows}} with {{certainty}} what education using <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>communication</b> {{technology will be}} like in the next ten years. The only thing that seems certain {{is that it will}} not be like the present. While no one can see into the future, we can research present realities and current rates of change as bases for projecting ahead. Video conference systems that operate over IP (Internet Protocol) are being implemented in educational organisations, businesses and homes around the globe. Video conference manufacturers inform us that the implementation of such systems and their use is relatively straightforward. This {{may or may not be}} the case. This research argues that there is significantly more to implementing video conferencing over IP than simply installing the equipment, training staff and commencing classes. This study reports on an investigation into the effectiveness of implementing digital video conferencing over IP in educational institutions. It specifically looks at this in respect of the desktop and small group user. Research in desktop videoconferencing in education exists but is not abundant, for example, Thompson (1996), Kies et al., (1997), Bogen et al., (1997), Daunt (1999), Davis and Kelly (2002), Davis et al., (2004). With the considerable progress made in IP technologies, more educational providers are moving to use desktop and small group videoconference systems to link to classes and/or students over the Internet. This is a trend that is growing rapidly world-wide. The implementation and application of IP video conferencing in education is under-researched. This study examines three separate case studies to collect the required data. It looks at the processes required to set up effective communications with students and teachers using digital media. It identifies the specific difficulties that need to be overcome, both technically as well as the human factors that are involved. It addresses these issues chiefly as related to desktop users and small groups of participants in particular. In conclusion it also focuses on the design aspects of the video conference equipment and venues used in educational environments. The aim of the research, therefore, is to understand current and future trends of implementing and using video conferencing over IP, in a technical, human and design sense. The research has practical significance for educational institutions, as it provides useful information for students, tutors, technicians and designers involved in digital video conferencing technologies now, and in the years to come...|$|E

30|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>video</b> {{stabilization}} (DVS) {{techniques have}} been studied for decades to improve visual quality of image sequences captured by compact and lightweight <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> cameras. When such cameras are hand held or mounted on unstable platforms, the captured video generally looks shaky because of undesired camera motions.

With recent advances in wireless technology, video stabilization systems are also considered for integration into wireless <b>video</b> <b>communication</b> equipments for the stabilization of acquired sequences before transmission, not only to improve visual quality but also to increase the compression performance [1]. Solutions to the stabilization problem involve either hardware or software to compensate the unwanted camera motion. The hardware-based stabilizers are generally expensive and lack the kind of compactness that is crucial for today’s consumer electronic devices [7, 8]. On the contrary, a DVS system that is implemented by software can easily be miniaturized and updated. Consequently, DVS system is suitable for portable digital devices, such as digital camera and mobile phone.|$|R
