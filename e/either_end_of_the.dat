5|$|At {{the final}} whistle, Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola offered his commiserations {{to each of}} Manchester United's players, while former Manchester United defender Gerard Piqué talked with his {{erstwhile}} teammates. Both teams then retreated to <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium to applaud their fans.|$|E
5|$|No light armor {{was fitted}} above the main belt or at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship. This made Texas highly {{vulnerable}} to rapid-fire guns using high-explosive shells. This {{was not considered}} a significant threat at the time Texas was designed but would become so within a few years.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, Ganapati and {{his brother}} Kartikeya (Kumara, Subramanya) or the saktis, the female counterparts, {{can be found at}} either end of this carving. Carvings of the river Goddesses Ganga and Yamuna are found at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot of the doorway to the shrine in early temples.|$|E
5000|$|Several rowing clubs at <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake, {{specifically}} 2014 APSMRC Park South Melbourne, Caulfield Grammar School, Argonauts, YWCA, Korowa GS, Wesley College, Brighton Grammar School.|$|R
5000|$|Newell [...] {{proposed}} an exact method {{to solve the}} kinematic wave equation based on cumulative curves only at <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corridor, without evaluating any intermediate points.|$|R
50|$|The North Island has {{a larger}} {{population}} than the South Island {{with both the}} country's largest city, Auckland {{as well as the}} capital, Wellington at <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island.|$|R
5|$|The highway {{was built}} in the 1850s as part of the Opeongo and Ottawa Colonization Road, {{providing}} access to Renfrew County for settlement in the Opeongo Hills. However, it did not become a provincial highway until 1956. Aside from the change in number of the highways at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route, the route has remained the same since then.|$|E
5|$|The older {{part of the}} brick-built hall {{consists}} of seven bays, over two floors. There are projecting bays at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, dressed with ashlar quoins. A central doorway is flanked with plain pilasters, also of ashlar. The roof is of a hipped design, with a central octagonal bellcote, topped by a small dome.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke. In {{order to provide}} more space, he added blocks at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frontage, and galleried wings {{on either side of}} the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844–46, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.|$|E

50|$|Due to <b>the</b> unique {{configuration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{tracks on}} <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station, trains can depart from any platform {{in any direction}} when necessary (mostly seen in peak time or disruptions).|$|R
50|$|The two big tanks Honnamanakere(formerly LakshmiSamudra) and Nachanahallikere(formerly KeshavaSamudra)situated at <b>the</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village {{also have}} {{historical}} importance. The annual cart festival for the Village deity Honnadevi takes place every {{year during the}} spring.|$|R
5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large slab of laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E
5|$|Each {{platform}} has two same-level fare control areas, one at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station, {{and there}} are no crossovers or crossunders. The full-time ones are at the north end and each has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the northeast and southeast corners of Bergen and Smith Streets while those on the Coney Island-bound platform go up to the northwest and southwest corners. The fare control areas on {{the south end of the}} platforms are unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and one street stair to the northeast corner of Warren and Smith Streets on the Manhattan-bound platform and the northwest corner for the Coney Island-bound platform. The south fare control area is more heavily used.|$|E
5|$|In October 1963, London Transport ordered five {{double decker}} buses {{based on the}} Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck {{purpose-built}} for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above {{the level of the}} road, accessible from special platforms built at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnel; there was also a ladder built {{into the side of the}} bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the current transfer service. One of these buses has been preserved.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station has}} two {{high-level}} side platforms. The north platform, {{next to the}} main track, is 12 cars long. The south platform, next to the siding, is eight cars long, and is not in use. There is also a pedestrian bridge connecting the two platforms. [...] On <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station, the two tracks merge into one.|$|R
50|$|CMBT {{station is}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five {{stations}} in <b>the</b> first phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chennai Metro project identified {{to be converted}} into commercial hubs, the others being Alandur, Arumbakkam, Ekkattuthangal, and Ashok Nagar. Two buildings are planned on <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CMBT station depending on <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> land.|$|R
50|$|Kavady {{translates}} in Tamil {{language as}} a pole slung across the shoulder to evenly distribute <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> whatever is being carried, usually in bundles on <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pole. <b>The</b> carrying <b>of</b> kavady symbolizes <b>the</b> carrying <b>of</b> one’s burden and then resting it at <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord.|$|R
5|$|Mir was {{authorized}} on a 17 February 1976 decree, to design an improved {{model of the}} Salyut DOS-17K space stations. Four Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971, with three more being launched during Mirs development. It was planned that the station's core module (DOS-7 and the backup DOS-8) would be equipped {{with a total of}} four docking ports; two at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station as with the Salyut stations, and an additional two ports on either side of a docking sphere {{at the front of the}} station to enable further modules to expand the station's capabilities. By August 1978, this had evolved to the final configuration of one aft port and five ports in a spherical compartment at the forward end of the station.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand is the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, {{formerly}} Old Trafford's {{main stand}} and previously {{known as the}} South Stand. Although only a single-tiered stand, the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand contains most of the ground's executive suites, and also plays host to any VIPs who may come to watch the match. Members of the media are seated {{in the middle of}} the Upper South Stand to give them the best view of the match. The television gantry is also in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, so the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand is the one that gets shown on television least often. Television studios are located at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, with the club's in-house television station, MUTV, in the East studio and other television stations, such as the BBC and Sky, in the West studio.|$|E
5|$|Swordfishs diving {{depth and}} time {{are not known}} because the records from her sea trials have not survived. Shutting down her boiler, {{retracting}} the funnel and sealing the boiler uptake required about {{a minute and a}} quarter, which included switching over to the electric motors. In marked contrast to contemporary Vickers designs much attention was paid to safety arrangements, including her extensive subdivision. Indicator and telephone buoys, which could be released from inside the submarine were provided together with external air connections and a charged high-pressure line which could provide air to any manned compartment or the living spaces. Furthermore, the main ballast tanks could be blown from <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship.|$|E

40|$|Improper method {{employed}} to bond permanent lingual retainer results in clinical problems. A simple, convenient and cost-effective method is being suggested to bond permanent lingual retainer. This method involves <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> stainless steel archwire.

The tag arms on this archwire {{pass on the}} lingual aspect and hold the retainer wire passively, thus, allowing easy and effective retainer wire stabilization...|$|R
5|$|The castle's {{original}} appearance {{differed significantly}} {{from that of}} today. The arrow-shaped Water Bastion facing into the Medway and the main block behind it {{were part of the}} original design. There were also towers at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water frontage, though these were subsequently replaced by towers of a different design. The gatehouse and moat were later additions. A number of derelict buildings in Rochester Castle, Aylesford, and Bopley were pulled down to provide stone for the castle. The main structure had been completed by 1564, but it took another three years and an infusion of extra funds to finish the project. The total cost came to £4,349.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in {{the centre}} of the south curtain wall mostly dates from the 13thcentury. It was originally accessed via a drawbridge and visitors had to pass through two gates, one at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passage, and a portcullis. The semi-octagonal projections {{on either side of the}} gate passage are considered ornamental. Between the projections and above the gate were machicolations, openings for missiles to be hurled at attackers. The rooms on either side of the passage were guardrooms. The only remaining openings on the front are slits at ground level. Slits on the other sides of the gatehouse, and along the entrance passage, allowed the gatekeeper to watch people approaching and entering the castle. The structure underwent later alterations in the 19th and 20thcenturies when it housed the castle's custodian; slits in the gatehouse's front may have been filled in.|$|E
5|$|The plan of {{the house}} is unusual, partly because of its {{incorporation}} of the earlier building; it extends at right angles to the primary (southern) façade. The elevations are symmetrical, facing outwards, but the interior court is narrow, and projecting wings lie at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern and western sides. Bramshill House is three storeys high on the southern main entrance side and two storeys high to the north and east. There are three vaulted cellars to the west. The house is built of red brick laid in English bond dressed with stone, with ashlar quoining at the corners of the wings. Stone dressings are featured on numerous large mullion windows. An open carved parapet surmounts the building. The roof consists of red tiles, and there are large gables on the west side. The chimney stacks are rectangular.|$|E
40|$|The seven-membered ring in {{the title}} compound, C(20) H(19) N(3) O(3), adopts a boat {{conformation}} with the two phenylene C atoms representing the stern and the methylene C atom the prow.

5|$|Four large mosaic {{panels are}} {{installed}} on <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station {{hall and the}} two escalator tunnels. On the side {{that leads to the}} exit to the city, a panel was installed depicting <b>the</b> patron saint <b>of</b> Kiev, Michael <b>the</b> Archangel. Meanwhile, at <b>the</b> very <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station, Saint George is depicted, symbolizing Moscow, the Soviet Union's capital at <b>the</b> time. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mosaic panels at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station near the escalators includes an inscription featuring a Ukrainian nationalist slogan, stating СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ, which is translated as Glory to Ukraine.|$|R

5|$|In {{the western}} shadow of Saltwell Towers {{there is a}} maze, built in 1877 by Wailes for his family's use. The maze was replanted with yew trees {{as part of the}} 2005 {{regeneration}} project to the original plans laid by Wailes. Also renovated was Saltwell Dene, a picturesque wooded area with a stream, bridges, cascades and a lily pond which inspired local artist Thomas Miles Richardson to paint a watercolour of it in the 19thcentury. Saltwell Dene was the final part of the 21stcentury restoration project to be completed, reopening to the public in March 2005. At <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Broadwalk there are two wooden shelters whilst the centre of the Broadwalk is marked by the Almond Pavilion. The pavilion was opened in 1881 and was a refreshment pavilion for decades before it fell into disrepair; by the 1980s it was derelict and it was then completely destroyed by fire. It has been fully reconstructed, including a replica of the original clock tower, and is once more a refreshment kiosk with new toilet facilities. It offers panoramic views into the northern fields and across the boating lake. An oriental garden was opened in 2011 to mark the twenty-year anniversary of the twinning arrangement between Gateshead and Komatsu. This includes a gravel pond, waterfalls and stone lanterns. The park is also host to three well-used bowling greens, replete with their own pavilion (the Avenue Green Pavilion) and a rose garden.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{tradition}} within the Australian Army for soldiers' recreational clubs on military bases to be named after a particular recipient of the Victoria Cross. Australia has a unique means of remembering recipients of the Victoria Cross. Remembrance Drive is a path through city streets and highways linking Sydney and Canberra. Trees were planted in February 1954 by Queen Elizabeth II in a park near Sydney Harbour and at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, marking <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route, with various plantations along the roadsides {{in memory of the}} fallen. Beginning in 1995, 23 rest stop memorials named for Australian recipients of the VC from World War II onwards have been sited along the route, providing picnic facilities and public amenities to encourage drivers to take a break on long drives. 23 of the 26 memorial sites have been dedicated, with a further three reserved for the surviving VC recipients, including two of the newer Victoria Cross for Australia awards. Edward Kenna, VC, was honoured with the most recent rest stop on 16 August 2012, having died in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Refrigerated {{ships were}} also made {{possible}} {{through the ice}} trade, allowing perishable goods to be exported internationally, first from the U.S. and then from countries such as Argentina and Australia. Early ships had stored their chilled goods along with the main cargo of ice; the first ships to transport chilled meat to Britain, designed by Bate, adapted the railroad refrigerator cars, using ice at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hold and a ventilation fan to keep the meat cool. An improved version, invented by James Craven, piped a brine solution through the ice and then the hold to keep the meat cool, and created a drier atmosphere in the hold, preserving the meat better. Natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches, initially in the eastern American fisheries. In 1858 the Grimsby fishing fleet began to take ice out to sea with them to preserve their catches; this allowed longer journeys and bigger catches, and the fishing industry became the biggest single user of ice in Britain.|$|E

Starting from the throats connecting to <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network, it sweeps all adjacent network elements containing a specific phase (water or oil, {{depending on the}} function argument). If a network element has no neighbor containing that phase, sweep stops in that element. If the sweep does not get to <b>the</b> other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network, that phase {{is assumed to be}} trapped in <b>the</b> swept cluster <b>of</b> elements. <b>The</b> trapped phase has no connectivity, and hence, its conductance is zero in the trapped area.|$|R
