5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E
25|$|The {{church was}} later rebuilt in the {{perpendicular}} gothic style, and although ostensibly Norman, {{some of the}} architectural furniture, for example the font, were of the Anglo-Saxon style (or at latest, early Norman), thus <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> church was rebuilt upon {{the site of the}} earlier building.|$|E
25|$|NET (0.5 to 3mg/day) {{has been}} found to dose-dependently {{decrease}} circulating SHBG levels, which is a common property of androgens and is due to AR-mediated suppression of hepatic SHBG production. The drug also has estrogenic activity, and estrogens are known to increase SHBG hepatic production and circulating levels, so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> androgenic activity of NET overpowers its estrogenic activity in this regard.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1857 the Ellan Vannin's regular sailings were {{augmented}} by summer cruises from Douglas via Castletown {{and on to the}} Calf of Mann. Also further pleasure cruises were added via Peel and onwards to the north of Ireland. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vessel was being utilised to her maximum. Sailings to Whitehaven and Liverpool were maintained whilst sailings to Glasgow and from Liverpool to Dundrum via the Isle of Man were introduced.|$|E
25|$|The {{constraints}} {{in their}} primitive form are rather singular, {{this was the}} reason for integrating them over test functions to obtain smeared constraints. However, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> equation for the master constraint, given above, is even more singular involving the product of two primitive constraints (although integrated over space). Squaring the constraint is dangerous as it could lead to worsened ultraviolent behaviour of the corresponding operator and hence the master constraint programme must be approached with due care.|$|E
25|$|The Kingship of Archenland is {{not broken}} {{by either the}} White Witch or the Telmarines, so the line from King Frank I and Queen Helen remains unbroken, and Archenland still exists {{at the end of}} the world. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> witch's powers of {{repression}} and climate control; even use of her wand, did not extend beyond the bounds of Narnia itself. Hence the royal line and more general presence of humans in a nearby location did not directly threaten the witch.|$|E

25|$|From {{the reports}} of discussions {{published}} by the society, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority of the members accepted that evolution had occurred. However the discussions rarely mentioned Darwin's most original contribution, his proposed mechanism of natural selection; Darwin's ideas were considered as an extension to those of Lamarck. In contrast, even the possibility that evolution had occurred was rarely mentioned in the discussions of other learned societies such as the Société Botanique, the Société Zoologique, the Société Géologique and the Académie des Sciences.|$|E
25|$|After Melaka was conquered by the Portuguese in 1511, and {{the ruling}} family had {{established}} a successor polity in Johor, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 'ways of Malay' continued to be fostered and began to have an influence in surrounding sultanates. Startling even to the Portuguese conquerors was {{the extent to which}} most of Sumatra's east coast had been influenced by its neighbour across the straits; almost all urban elites spoke Melakan Malay, and they also acknowledged not only correct speech but also good manners and appropriate behaviour, as Malay custom. The role of Melaka as a model also becomes evident, when comparing its law codes with those of other succeeding Malay sultanates.|$|E
25|$|The new diocese {{comprised}} {{the counties of}} Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Berkshire, and the Channel Islands. It was thus almost co-terminous with {{the limits of the}} Diocese of Winchester. The obvious place for the cathedral and curia of the new diocese was Winchester. The Ecclesiastical Titles Act forbade a Catholic diocese to have the same name as an Anglican see. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original intention was to fix the see at Southampton, with St Joseph Church in Bugle Street as the pro-cathedral. The construction of a large parish church in the centre of Portsmouth had begun, and it was decided to make it the future cathedral of the diocese.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bow of Scorpion skidded upon {{impact with}} the globigerina ooze {{on the sea}} floor, digging a sizable trench. The sail had been dislodged, as the hull of the {{operations}} compartment upon which it perched disintegrated, and was lying on its port side. One of Scorpions running lights was in the open position, {{as if it had}} been on the surface at the time of the mishap, although it may have been left in the open position during the vessel's recent nighttime stop at Rota. One Trieste II pilot who dived on Scorpion said that the shock of the implosion may have knocked the light into the open position.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} view of {{the process}} is that vacuum fluctuations cause a particle–antiparticle pair to appear close to the event horizon of a black hole. One of the pair falls into the black hole while the other escapes. In order to preserve total energy, the particle that fell into the black hole {{must have had a}} negative energy (with respect to an observer far away from the black hole). This causes the black hole to lose mass, and, to an outside observer, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> black hole has just emitted a particle. In another model, the process is a quantum tunnelling effect, whereby particle–antiparticle pairs will form from the vacuum, and one will tunnel outside the event horizon.|$|E
25|$|Harvest was in {{the late}} spring and during the dry summer months. Nomadic Amorites from the {{northwest}} would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the stubble and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, {{they would have to}} pay a tax in wool, meat, milk, and cheese to the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years, all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem, and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region.|$|E

25|$|Despite the film's {{supposedly}} historically grounded approach, much artistic licence {{is taken}} regarding historical figures, peoples, events, religion, wardrobe and weaponry. The film places {{the story of}} Arthur not in its better-known medieval setting, but in the (still plausible) earlier times of antiquity, the early dawn of the Middle Ages – as did the earliest versions of the Arthur story. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Arthur depicted in the film is based most closely upon Ambrosius Aurelianus, the Romano-Briton who fought against the Saxons in the 5th century, and was probably {{the leader of the}} Romano-British at the Battle of Mons Badonicus (Mount Badon). Nevertheless, Arthur's full name in the film is Artorius Castus, referring to Lucius Artorius Castus, a historical Roman active in Britain in the 2nd or 3rd century. It is specified Arthur was given the ancestral name of a legendary leader.|$|E
25|$|A {{report by}} TfL in early 2007 {{indicated}} that there were 2.27 traffic delays per kilometre in the original charging zone. This compared with a figure of 2.3 before {{the introduction of the}} congestion charge. After the scheme was introduced they had measured an improvement in journey times of 0.7 minutes per km, or 30%. This improvement had decreased to 22% in 2006, and during 2006 congestion levels had increased so that the improvement, compared to the year before the scheme, was just 7%. TfL explained this as a result of changes to road priorities within the zone, delays caused by new pedestrian and road user safety schemes, and, most particularly, a doubling of road works {{in the latter half of}} 2006. Utilities were encouraged to complete planned road works in the year preceding the congestion charge, so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first year of measurement used for later comparisons would also have been affected by streetworks to some extent.|$|E
25|$|There {{remains a}} lively {{debate on the}} left, over whether the Red Clydeside {{movement}} constituted a revolutionary opportunity for the working-class, though {{on the face of}} it, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> revolutionary potential of the Clydeside working-class has been exaggerated. Firstly, except Maclean, none of the labour leaders developed a class analysis of the war, nor did they seriously consider threatening the power and authority of the state. Furthermore, it was the behaviour of those conducting the war, not the war itself that provoked opposition within the labour movement. The Independent Labour Party's May Day Manifesto of 1918 makes this very clear in calling for A Living Wage for all and Justice for our Soldiers and their Dependants. Moreover, the massive demand for men to fight in the war meant that few Glaswegian families escaped personal loss of some kind. To undermine the war effort was to risk alienating the working-class, which many labour leaders were unwilling to do-–apart from Maxton, Gallacher and Maclean.|$|E

25|$|The 1982 {{game between}} Texas and Alabama {{would be the}} final time that Bear Bryant would face the Longhorns. Having lost to Texas in all {{meetings}} prior, Alabama went into the fourth quarter ahead 10–0 and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bear would finally get a win over Texas while at Alabama. But the Longhorns scored their first points with a quarterback draw by Robert Brewer on a 3rd-and-long with 10:38 remaining. On Texas' next possession, Terry Orr scored from eight yards out to cap an 11-play, 80-yard drive to put the Longhorns up 14–10 with 2:05 remaining. Alabama's Joey Jones returned the ensuing kickoff to the Texas 38-yard line, and Tide quarterback Walter Lewis took over with 1:54 left. On the very next play, UT's William Graham picked off a Lewis pass at the one. The Longhorns took a safety to insure better field position and Texas once again stunned Alabama and the Bear with a 14–12 victory.|$|E
25|$|On December 12, 2005, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Williams, another {{civil suit}} brought under section 1964(c) of RICO. In this case, {{employees}} alleged that their employer, Mohawk Industries (Mohawk), violated RICO by knowingly employing illegal immigrants {{with the help}} of third party employment agencies. The larger job pool enabled Mohawk to lower the wages of its legal employees and thereby reduce its labor costs. The Supreme Court, on the same day as its decision in Ideal, issued a brief order stating that certiorari had been granted improvidently and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit for consideration in light of its decision in Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp. Under the Ideal rationale, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> direct victim of Mohawk's RICO violations was the federal government, not Mohawk's employees. Therefore, Ideal may pose a problem to the plaintiffs' case in Mohawk.|$|E
25|$|It was a Greek colony, but founded at {{a period}} {{considerably}} later {{than most of}} the other Greek cities in this part of Italy. The territory in which it was established had previously belonged to the Ionic colony of Siris, and after the fall of that city seems to have become the subject of contention between the neighboring states. The Athenians had a claim upon the territory of Siris, and it was probably in virtue of this that their colonists the Thurians, almost immediately after their establishment in Italy, advanced similar pretensions. These were, however, resisted by the Tarentines; and war ensued between the two states, which was at length terminated by an arrangement that they should found a new colony in the disputed district, which, though in fact a joint settlement, should be designated as a colony of Tarentum (modern Taranto). The few remaining inhabitants of Siris were added to the new colonists, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> settlement was first established on the ancient site of Siris itself, but was subsequently transferred from thence, and an ancient, but new city founded about 24 stadia from the former, and nearer the river Aciris, to which the name of Heraclea was given. Siris did not cease to exist, but lapsed into the subordinate condition of the port or emporium of Heraclea. The foundation of the new city is placed by Diodorus in 432BCE, fourteen years after the settlement of Thurii; a statement which appears to agree well with the above narrative, cited by Strabo from Antiochus of Syracuse. Diodorus, as well as Livy, calls it simply a colony of Tarentum. Antiochus is the only writer who mentions the share taken by the Thurians in its original foundation. Pliny erroneously regards Heraclea as identical with Siris, to which it had succeeded; and it was perhaps a similar misconception that led Livy, by a strange anachronism, to include Heraclea among the cities of Magna Graecia where Pythagoras established his institutions.|$|E
