25|$|The Los Angeles Police Department {{contacted}} Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a {{close friend}} of Bill Cosby for many years, to ask for his phone number. Waters declined to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> instead asking another close friend, Essence magazine publisher Ed Lewis, {{to be the one to}} tell Cosby. However, the police contacted the CBS studio which produced his new series, Cosby, filmed in New York at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens. Cosby was on set at the time when producer Joanne Curley-Kerner informed him of the death of his son. Los Angeles police later spoke with him and discouraged him from flying to Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|Seven {{years later}} Mulder {{returns to the}} FBI when the X-Files is re-opened, in order to look into a {{government}} conspiracy when it transpires they have been using alien technology. Along with Scully they investigate several cases together like they had done originally. Six weeks after their return to the X-Files, Mulder confronts an alive Smoking Man to try and prevent him carrying out a plan to depopulate the United States using a virus applied through smallpox vaccines. However Mulder falls sick to the disease but refuses the Smoking Man's help and his proposal to join his elite. Mulder is saved by Agent Miller and they regroup with Scully, however she says Mulder needs a blood transfusion and only their son can <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> At that moment, an unidentified flying object hovers over the trio.|$|E

500|$|Bolt {{stated that}} setting a record {{was not a}} {{priority}} for him, and that his goal was just to win the gold medal, Jamaica's first of the 2008 Games. Olympic medallist Kriss Akabusi construed Bolt's chest slapping before the finish line as showboating, noting that the actions cost Bolt an even faster record time. IOC president Jacques Rogge also condemned the Jamaican's actions as disrespectful. Bolt denied {{that this was the}} purpose of his celebration by saying, [...] "I wasn't bragging. When I saw I wasn't covered, I was just happy". Lamine Diack, president of the IAAF, supported Bolt and said that his celebration was appropriate given the circumstances of his victory. Jamaican government minister Edmund Bartlett also defended Bolt's actions, stating, [...] "We have to see it in the glory of their moment and <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> We have to allow the personality of youth to express itself".|$|E
500|$|The lyrical meaning behind [...] "Give It Away" [...] is {{centered}} on the philosophy of selflessness and altruistic behavior. The song is titled after its most prevalent lyrical phrase [...] "give it away", which is taken from an experience Kiedis had with his former girlfriend—punk rock singer Nina Hagen—in the early 1980s. Hagen was several years Kiedis' senior and became a role-model during his drug addiction to heroin: [...] "she realized how young and inexperienced I was then, so she was always passing on gems to me, not in a preachy way, just by seizing on opportunities." [...] When Kiedis was looking through her closet he came across a jacket he liked, and commented to Hagen that it was [...] "really cool". Upon expressing this, Hagen immediately told him to keep it. Her reasoning behind this selflessness was due to an attempt to constantly make her life more enjoyable, and explained to Kiedis that [...] "if you have a closet full of clothes {{and you try to}} keep them all, your life will get very small. But if you have a full closet and someone sees something they like, if you <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> the world is a better place." ...|$|E
500|$|A notable {{minority}} of Patton's officers were unimpressed or displeased with their commander's use of obscenities, viewing it as unprofessional conduct {{for a military}} officer. Among some officers' later recounting of the speech, bullshit would be replaced by baloney and fucking by fornicating. At least one account replaced [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the balls" [...] with [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the nose." [...] Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate. It was well known {{that the two men}} were polar opposites in personality, and there is considerable evidence that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally. In response to criticisms of his coarse language, Patton wrote to a family member, [...] "When I want my men to remember something important, to really make it stick, I <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> double dirty. It may not sound nice to a bunch of little old ladies, at an afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember. You can't run an army without profanity, {{and it has to be}} eloquent profanity. An army without profanity couldn't fight its way out of a piss-soaked paper bag." ...|$|E

2500|$|Finally, the Court {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} not allowing tribes to prosecute nonmembers, those nonmembers would escape prosecution altogether for criminal activity engaged in within tribal boundaries. The federal government retains the power to prosecute felonies that take place on reservations. Tribes retain the power to expel undesirable persons. Tribal authorities may still arrest the nonmember and detain him until he can be handed over to authorities who do {{have the power to}} prosecute the nonmember. The tribe pointed out that state authorities can lack the power to prosecute crimes committed by nonmembers on reservations; Arizona, for instance, expressly disclaims this prosecutorial authority. But Congress has allowed states to assume this power, and Arizona is free to take up Congress's invitation. Finally, if the tribes still believed that there remained a [...] "jurisdictional void," [...] despite these options, they could persuade Congress to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

In the same press event, details followed including the new setting between Saw II and Saw III {{as well as the}} basic storyline of David Tapp's son and protagonist Michael investigating his death and encountering Jigsaw along the way. Martin Schneider, European Marketing & PR Director for Konami, stated that [...] " [...] original Saw video game gave horror fans and gamers a new outlet to advance their favorite genre, but left them wanting more. Saw 2 will <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> but be careful for what you wish for!

2500|$|By {{about half}} mile past Crenshaw Crossing at Moake Crossing, McDowell was already bloodied and limping, {{unable to walk}} any further. A union man told him, [...] "I'm {{going to kill you}} and use you for bait to catch the other men." [...] He and another man grabbed McDowell and led him down a side road. Gunshots were heard, and the rest {{continued}} towards Herrin. A farmer later discovered McDowell's body. He had been shot four times – twice in the stomach, and once each in the chest and head. [...] A car drove up to the procession, and a man came out whom some said they overheard being called [...] "Hugh Willis" [...] and [...] "the president." [...] According to the accounts of surviving captives, Willis said, [...] "Listen, don't you go killing these fellows on a public highway. There are too many women and children and witnesses around to do that. Take them over in the woods and <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Kill all you can." ...|$|E

2500|$|Food for fancy mice {{can range}} from {{specially}} formulated feed mix to kitchen scraps. [...] Carrot, spinach, lettuce and other vegetables are often enjoyed by mice but should be given sparingly as such foods can result in diarrhea and life-threatening dehydration. [...] Bread crumbs, wheat and rice can also be good for mice. Laboratories keeping mice as experimental subjects almost uniformly use a product called lab block, a scientifically formulated blend originally designed for mice in laboratories. In order to keep variety in their diets, mice can also eat oats, oily seeds, clean eggshell, breakfast cereal, and stale bread. Fruit and vegetables {{are part of a}} more natural and healthful diet. [...] Some owners <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as a treat after they do a trick. Mice often chew wood and other hard substances which keeps their teeth from growing too long; salt licks are also an option. [...] As mice and rats have similar diets, some pet mouse owners choose to feed rat food. [...] Although it is common practice to feed premixed diets designed for other rodents, for the longevity and health of the animal it is best to feed mouse-targeted diets. [...] Diets for hamsters, for instance, are known to contain higher protein than what is required for mice or rats. [...] Homemade diets can be blended using grains, rice, oats, seeds (such as peanut, sunflower, and pumpkin), high quality dog food, {{as well as a number}} of other ingredients.|$|E
