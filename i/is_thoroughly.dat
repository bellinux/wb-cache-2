5|$|If a large insect is {{struggling}} in a web, Portia does not usually take the insect, but waits {{for up to}} a day until the insect stops struggling, even if the prey <b>is</b> <b>thoroughly</b> stuck. When an insect stuck in a web owned by P. labiata, P. schultzi or any regional variant of P. fimbriata, and next to a web spider's web, the web spider sometimes enters the Portia′s web, and the Portia pursues and catches the web spider.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{candidate}} cities are selected, they must {{submit to the}} IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project {{as part of a}} candidature file. Each city <b>is</b> <b>thoroughly</b> analysed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit {{the candidate}} cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC's final decision. During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that {{it will be able to}} fund the Games. After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running. The IOC members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.|$|E

25|$|But Cooley is not {{so easily}} defeated. He uncovers a minor bureaucrat named Gelman who testifies that twenty years earlier then-University of Chicago {{instructor}} Leffingwell invited Gelman to join a small Communist cell that included a fellow traveler who went by the pseudonym James Morton. After outright lies under oath by the nominee and vigorous cross examination by Leffingwell, Gelman <b>is</b> <b>thoroughly</b> discredited and deemed an unfit witness by the subcommittee and its charismatic chairman Utah Senator Brig Anderson.

At the mikvah itself, a female attendant is present to make certain that the woman immerses herself fully, including her hairs. Though that is the attendant's foremost duty, she may also help by checking a woman's back or answer questions regarding proper ritual protocol.|$|E

25|$|I {{feel that}} Admiral Wright is {{extremely}} well qualified {{to perform the}} duties of Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic. Admiral Wright has extensive background and naval command experience in positions of vital importance and he is an officer of outstanding character and ability.

I feel that Admiral Wright will uphold and carry forward the fine traditions and worthy objectives sought by all the NATO nations. I have every confidence that Admiral Wright can make an outstanding contribution to our common defense effort.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} {{structure is}} painted black to equalize temperature by radiative heat transfer. Overall, the spacecraft <b>is</b> <b>thoroughly</b> blanketed to retain heat. Unlike the Pioneers and Voyagers, the radio dish is also enclosed in blankets that {{extend to the}} body. The heat from the RTG adds warmth to the spacecraft while {{it is in the}} outer Solar System. While in the inner Solar System, the spacecraft must prevent overheating, hence electronic activity is limited, power is diverted to shunts with attached radiators, and louvers are opened to radiate excess heat. While the spacecraft is cruising inactively in the cold outer Solar System, the louvers are closed, and the shunt regulator reroutes power to electric heaters.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to The Original Series, Klingon culture <b>is</b> <b>thoroughly</b> examined in later series' episodes, {{part of a}} larger movement by Star Trek writers to deepen viewer understanding of the alien races of the franchise. The Klingons adhere to a strict code of honor, similar to feudal Mongolian or Japanese customs, although some, such as Gowron, appear to struggle to live up to their ideals. Their society is based on war and combat; ritual suicide is often preferred over living life as a crippled warrior, and may allow a warrior to die with honor. To be captured rather than killed in battle brings dishonor to not only the captive but his descendants. Death is depicted as a time for celebration, not grief.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} that the gas mixture in a cylinder <b>is</b> <b>thoroughly</b> mixed before analysing or the results will be inaccurate. When partial pressure or mass blending is done at low flow rates the gases entering the cylinder are not moving fast enough to ensure good mixing, and particularly when blends contain Helium, they may tend to remain in layers due to density differences. This is termed stratification, and if left long enough, diffusion will ensure complete mixing. However, if the gas is to be analysed soon after blending, mechanical agitation is recommended. This may be by lying a single cylinder on a flat surface and rolling it for a short period, but twins are more usually inverted a few times. Stratification is more pronounced with blends containing helium, but can also lead to inaccurate analysis of Nitrox blends.|$|E

25|$|Between {{the events}} of the two books, quite a bit has happened. Lorena, lover of Gus McCrae, has left Clara and married Pea Eye Parker, of the former Hat Creek Outfit. They have several children, and own a farm in the Texas Panhandle. Pea Eye <b>is</b> <b>thoroughly</b> devoted to Lorena, and Lorena has learned to {{reciprocate}} and become almost equally attached to Pea Eye. Lorena teaches in a nearby schoolhouse. The cattle ranch (set up by the Hat Creek outfit in Montana) has collapsed. Newt is dead, fallen on by the Hell Bitch. Call has finally admitted to himself that Newt was his son. July Johnson is dead, and Clara lives alone. Call has gone back to being a Ranger and a gun-for-hire. Trains have greatly expanded the reach of civilization and have pushed back the frontier. The American West is no longer rough and tumble and Captain Woodrow F. Call has become a relic, albeit a greatly respected one. Nineteen-year-old Joey Garza and his deadly German rifle (capable of killing a man at a distance of half a mile) are not about to let law and order close the book on the Wild West just yet.|$|E
25|$|The {{volume of}} air that moves {{in or out}} (at the nose or mouth) during a single {{breathing}} cycle is called the tidal volume. In a resting adult human it is about 500ml per breath. At the end of exhalation the airways contain about 150ml of alveolar air {{which is the first}} air that is breathed back into the alveoli during inhalation. This volume air that is breathed out of the alveoli and back in again is known as dead space ventilation, which has the consequence that of the 500ml breathed into the alveoli with each breath only 350ml (500ml - 150ml = 350ml) is fresh warm and moistened air. Since this 350ml of fresh air <b>is</b> <b>thoroughly</b> mixed and diluted by the air that remains in the alveoli after normal exhalation (i.e. the functional residual capacity of about 2.5–3.0liters), {{it is clear that the}} composition of the alveolar air changes very little during the breathing cycle (see Fig. 9). The oxygen tension (or partial pressure) remains close to 13-14kPa (about 100mmHg), and that of carbon dioxide very close to 5.3kPa (or 40mmHg). This contrasts with composition of the dry outside air at sea level, where the partial pressure of oxygen is 21kPa (or 160mmHg) and that of carbon dioxide 0.04kPa (or 0.3mmHg).|$|E
