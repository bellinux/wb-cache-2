5|$|Goldman {{was well}} known during her life, {{described}} as—among other things—"the most dangerous woman in America". After her death and through the middle part of the 20th century, her fame faded. Scholars and historians of anarchism viewed <b>her</b> <b>as</b> a great speaker and activist, but did not regard <b>her</b> <b>as</b> a philosophical or theoretical thinker on par with, for instance, Kropotkin.|$|E
5|$|A beggar woman {{enters the}} shop {{in search of}} Bamford, and Johanna hides in the trunk. The woman recognizes Todd, but upon hearing Turpin coming, Todd kills her and sends her through a {{trapdoor}} in the floor. As Turpin enters, Todd explains that Johanna had repented and is coming to him, then offers a free shave in the meantime. When Turpin finally recognizes Todd as Benjamin Barker, Todd stabs him several times, cuts his throat and sends his body down a trap door to the bakehouse, killing him. Johanna comes out of her hiding place, still in disguise, and Todd prepares to kill <b>her</b> <b>as</b> well, not recognizing <b>her</b> <b>as</b> his daughter. However, hearing Mrs. Lovett scream in horror in the basement after discovering Turpin's body, Todd lets Johanna go.|$|E

5|$|Akane {{was created}} to be a {{relatable}} character who would question the setting and answer the viewer's questions. Early in the show's development, the production staff planned the way Akane would mature throughout the story. Early critical reception to Akane has been mixed. Some critics saw <b>her</b> <b>as</b> typical new cop often seen in dramas; others criticized <b>her</b> <b>as</b> uninteresting. However, her growth in the story earned praise for becoming a highly appealing protagonist.|$|E
5|$|Also in 941, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters {{reports that}} a {{chieftain}} named Áed Albanach was slain amongst a vast host of Dublin Vikings by the invading forces of Amargein mac Cináeda, overking of Uí Failge. The fact that Áed bore a Gaelic personal name, died with the Dubliners, and bore an epithet referring to a Scotsman, could be evidence {{that he was a}} successor of Gebeachan. Further evidence of this may be the record of Mór, a woman attested by the twelfth-century pseudo-historical Caithréim Chellacháin Chaisil, which identifies <b>her</b> <b>as</b> a daughter of a certain Áed mac Echach, and describes <b>her</b> <b>as</b> the daughter of a King of the Hebrides.|$|E
50|$|Lloyd's Register for 1787 shows <b>her</b> master <b>as</b> W. Hunter and <b>her</b> trade <b>as</b> London-St. Petersburg. However, a later {{addition}} to the entry shows <b>her</b> master <b>as</b> D. Sinclair, and <b>her</b> trade <b>as</b> London-Botany Bay. It does not report any armament, which is not surprising as Britain was not at war with anyone. It still shows <b>her</b> launch year <b>as</b> 1784 and <b>her</b> burthen <b>as</b> 650 tons (bm).|$|R
25|$|Cyprus first {{appears in}} the {{registers}} in 1818 with Davidson, master. The registers disagree over her owner and trade. Lloyds Register gives the name of <b>her</b> owner <b>as</b> R.

In 2007, Cortana was {{named one of}} the 50 {{greatest}} female characters by Tom's Hardware for the character's determination and fearlessness, which meshed perfectly with the game's protagonist. In 2010, Cracked.com ranked <b>her</b> <b>as</b> first on the list of the supporting characters in video games.

5|$|Author Raven Grimassi {{has written}} {{extensively}} about Aradia in his popularization of Stregheria, presenting what he admits is his own personal rendering of her story. He differs from Leland in many ways, particularly in portraying <b>her</b> <b>as</b> a witch who lived and taught in 14th-century Italy, rather than a goddess.|$|E
5|$|Back on the highway, an {{ambulance}} crew try to resuscitate Black, {{who has been}} outside his car through the night after his vision of Lee. After he comes to, he realizes this alternate reality was Lee showing him a life without the Millennium Group. However, he is left unsure whether his role within the Group is protecting his family from evil, or exposing them to it. Black seeks out Lee in a refugee camp; meanwhile, Law and his crewmen are also tracking her, conspiring to kill her to avenge their fellow crew. Lee turns the men against each other with her visions, before Black arrives to rescue <b>her.</b> <b>As</b> Black questions <b>her</b> <b>as</b> to the Group's influence, she resumes speaking in her unknown tongue, leaving Black without the answer he seeks.|$|E
