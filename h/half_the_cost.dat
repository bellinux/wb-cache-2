5|$|Dumbo, in {{production}} during {{the midst of}} the animators' strike, premiered in October 1941 and proved to be a financial success. The simple film only cost $950,000 to produce, <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, {{less than a third of}} the cost of Pinocchio, and two-fifths of the cost of Fantasia. Dumbo eventually grossed $1.6 million during its original release. In August 1942, Bambi was released, and as with Pinocchio and Fantasia, did not perform well at the box office. Out of its $1.7 million budget, it only grossed $1.64 million.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the show, Fox network {{officials}} forced the staff of The Simpsons to produce clip shows in order to save money. Originally, the producers were ordered to produce four clip show per season in order to meet episode limits imposed by the network. Fox network officials reasoned that clip shows could be produced at <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of a normal episode, but syndication rights could be sold at full price. The staff, however, felt such a large number of clip shows would alienate fans of the series.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, when US Internet was {{selected}} to construct the network, plans existed for the wireless service {{to be available to}} residents for a subscription of $19.95 per month, for speeds of one to three megabits per second, which were comparable to the speeds being offered by other internet service providers in the area at the time but at <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost.</b> USI Wireless has been marketing the service since then, including with billboards featuring local personality Fancy Ray.|$|E
50|$|Out of the 27 {{licenses}} issued, only 15 ISPs were {{in operation}} before 1997. Thus there were 15 International connections from Indonesia to the Internet, which were separated {{one from the}} other. Each ISP was therefore burdened with <b>half</b> <b>the</b> circuit <b>cost</b> to Indosat and <b>half</b> <b>the</b> circuit <b>cost</b> to <b>the</b> US.|$|R

5|$|Bellew's Gartership also {{witnessed}} {{changes to}} {{the fabric of the}} College of Arms. Although it had survived the Blitz, structural problems with the roof and brickwork forced the heralds to decide between leaving the College's buildings on Queen Victoria Street or attempting expensive repairs. In 1954, they approached the Ministry of Works to ask for financial assistance in the building work; the Ministry agreed to cover <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost.</b> A successful public appeal for the remaining funds followed and the restoration work carried out. The College of Arms Trust was established in 1956 to oversee funds for the building's maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Kirov was {{completely}} overhauled from 1949 to 1953. Her secondary armament was upgraded with electrically powered, fully automated 100mm B-34USM mountings and her fire-control system {{was replaced with}} a Zenit-26 system with SPN-500 stabilized directors. All of her light AA guns were replaced with nine twin gun water-cooled 37mm V-11 mounts. All of her radars were replaced with Soviet systems: Rif surface search, Gyuys air search, Zalp surface gunnery and Yakor' anti-aircraft gunnery radars. All anti-submarine weapons, torpedo launchers, aircraft equipment and boat cranes were removed. While expensive, about <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of a new Project 68bis , it was deemed a success and allowed Kirov to serve for another two decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{steam turbine}} {{section of a}} power plant, the turbine hall, {{generally}} costs about $1/W, and the electrical equipment to feed that power to the grid is about another $1/W. To reach the projected total CAPEX quoted in LIFE documents, this implies that the entire nuclear island has to cost around $4/W for LIFE.2, and just over $2/W for LIFE.3. Modern nuclear plants, benefiting from decades of commercial experience and continuous design work, cost just under $8/W, with approximately half {{of that in the}} nuclear island. LLNL's estimates require LIFE.3 to be built in 2040 for about <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of a fission plant today.|$|E

5|$|Geothermal power {{requires}} no fuel (except for pumps), {{and is therefore}} immune to fuel cost fluctuations. However, capital costs are significant. Drilling accounts for over <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs,</b> and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks. A typical well doublet (extraction and injection wells) in Nevada can support 4.5 megawatts (MW) and costs about $10million to drill, with a 20% failure rate.|$|R
5|$|Almost immediately, {{the company}} began looking at the {{possibility}} of converting {{all or part of the}} system into railways. W A Povis, their engineer, was convinced that railways could be built along the routes at around <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of building a new line. The move was opposed by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal who argued that closing bits of the inland waterways system would have serious repercussions on the parts left. Robert Stephenson suggested that a number of railways and canals should amalgamate, to reduce competition when bills were presented to Parliament. The canals to join the Ellesmere and Chester Company were the eastern and western branches of the Montgomeryshire Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal. Although some would be converted to railways, the route from Ellesmere Port to Middlewich via Barbridge Junction was part of the system that would be retained as a waterway, on which salt was a major source of revenue. The plans resulted in the formation of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company in 1846. The new company could raise £3.3 million of new capital, in addition to that already in existence, with another £1.1 million if necessary. They prompted new railways, but before any of the existing canals were converted, the company was leased to the London and North Western Railway, who took control in June 1847. They allowed the Shropshire Union to continue to operate fairly independently, and by 1849, the idea of conversion had been dropped, as the canals could still operate profitably.|$|E
25|$|Attlee's {{government}} {{made it possible}} for farm workers to borrow up to 90% of the cost of building their own houses, and received a subsidy of £15 a year for 40 years towards that cost. Grants were also made to meet up to <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of supplying water to farm buildings and fields, the government met <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of bracken eradication and lime spreading, and grants were paid for bringing hill farming land into use that had previously been considered unfit for farming purposes.|$|E

50|$|Casie Chetty was {{responsible}} for the construction of St. Peter's Church in Kalpity in 1839 and paid <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> himself. He also ran a Tamil school in Kalpity catering for 50 boys. He {{became a member of the}} Ceylonese branch of the Royal Asiatic Society when it was established in 1845. He wrote several books and manuscripts, most notably Ceylon Gazetteer (1834), The Tamil Plutarch (1859) and The Castes, Customs, Manners and Literature of the Tamils (1934).|$|R
25|$|A major {{technological}} advance was {{the design of}} the Dutch merchant ship known as the fluyt. Unlike rivals, it was not built for possible conversion in wartime to a warship, so it was cheaper to build and carried twice the cargo, and could be handled by a smaller crew. Construction by specialized shipyards using new tools made it <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of rival ships. The factors combined to sharply lower the cost of transportation for Dutch merchants, giving them a major competitive advantage.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the winter}} he {{organised}} a third {{edition of the}} Origin, adding an introductory historical sketch. Asa Gray had published three supportive articles in the Atlantic Monthly. Darwin persuaded Gray to publish them as a pamphlet, and was delighted when Gray {{came up with the}} title of Natural Selection Not Inconsistent with Natural Theology. Darwin paid <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost,</b> imported 250 copies into Britain and as well as advertising it in periodicals and sending 100 copies out to scientists, reviewers, and theologians (including Wilberforce), he included in the Origin a recommendation for it, available to be purchased for 1s. 6d. from Trübner's in Paternoster Row.|$|E
25|$|Along with Nash, the new Hudsons had {{the widest}} front {{seats in the}} industry. The Weather Eye heating and {{ventilation}} with an optional air conditioning system were highly rated in terms of efficiency. The integrated placement of major air conditioning systems under the hood {{and the price of}} only $395 (about <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> as on other cars) also won praise. Automotive journalist Floyd Clymer rated the Hudson Hornet as the safest car built in the United States because of (1) the single unit welded body, (2) high quality braking system with added mechanical backup system, (3) roadability, general handling, and maneuverability; as well as (4) excellent acceleration and power for emergency situations.|$|E

Investment cost savings come from various design features {{that may or may}} not be present in a particular simplified sewerage system. Cost-saving features of any simplified sewerage system are a smaller diameter of pipes, smaller and shallower trenches and simplified manholes.

25|$|The Spanish {{settlement}} of Alta California {{was the last}} colonization project to expand Spain's vastly over-extended empire in North America, {{and they tried to}} do it with minimal cost and support. Approximately <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of settling Alta California was borne by donations and half by funds from the Spanish crown. Massive Indian revolts in New Mexico's Pueblo Revolt among the Pueblo Indians of the Rio Grande valley in the 1680s as well as Pima Indian Revolt in 1751 and the ongoing Seri conflicts in Sonora Mexico provided the Franciscan friars with arguments to establish missions with fewer colonial settlers. In particular, the sexual exploitation of Native American women by Spanish soldiers sparked violent reprisals from the Native community and the spread of venereal disease.|$|E
25|$|As the Skybolt crisis {{came to the}} boil in the UK, an {{emergency}} meeting between Macmillan and Kennedy was arranged {{to take place in}} Nassau, Bahamas. Accompanying Macmillan were the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Home; Thorneycroft; Sandys; and Zuckerman. Naval expertise was supplied by Vice Admiral Michael Le Fanu. Ormsby-Gore flew to Nassau with Kennedy. En route, he brokered a deal whereby Britain and the United States would continue development of Skybolt, with each paying <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost,</b> the American half being a kind of termination fee. In London, over one hundred Conservative members of Parliament, nearly one third of the parliamentary party, signed a motion urging Macmillan to ensure that Britain remained an independent nuclear power.|$|E
25|$|The Gophers officially {{moved back}} onto campus, to TCF Bank Stadium, for the 2009 {{football}} season. The University believed an on-campus stadium would motivate its student base for increased ticket sales, and also {{would benefit from}} athletic revenues, {{not only for the}} football program, but the non-revenue sports as well. The new stadium reportedly cost less than half of a current-era NFL-style football stadium, and was built on what were former surface parking lots just a few blocks east of the former Memorial Stadium, with the naming rights purchased by TCF Bank. The University of Minnesota expected to raise more than <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the stadium via private donations. The Gopher Stadium bill was passed by both houses on May 20, 2006, the day before the Twins Stadium bill passed. On May 24, 2006, Governor Pawlenty signed the Gopher bill on the University campus.|$|E
50|$|The {{period of}} {{infestation}} stretched from July 1989 through November 1990.
