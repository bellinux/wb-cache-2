40|$|We {{illustrate}} a novel characterization of nonequivalent statistical mechanical ensembles using the mean-field Blume–Emery–Griffiths (BEG) model {{as a test}} model. The novel characterization takes effect {{at the level of}} the microcanonical and canonical <b>equilibrium</b> <b>distributions</b> of states.

40|$|Abstract. In {{recent works}} {{it has been}} {{demonstrated}} that using an appropriate rescaling, linear Boltzmann-type equations {{give rise to a}} scalar fractional diffusion equation in the limit of a small mean free path. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>distributions</b> are typically heavy-tailed distributions, but also classical Gaussian <b>equilibrium</b> <b>distributions</b> allow for this phenomena if combined with a degenerate collision frequency for small velocities. This work aims to an extension in the sense that a linear BGK-type equation conserving not only mass, but also momentum and energy, for both mentioned regimes of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>distributions</b> is considered. In the hydrodynamic limit we obtain a fractional diffusion equation for the temperature and density making use of the Boussinesq relation and we also demonstrate that with the same rescaling fractional diffusion cannot be derived additionally for the momentum. But considering the case of conservation of mass and momentum only, we do obtain the incompressible Stokes equation with fractional diffusion in the hydrodynamic limit for heavy-tailed equilibria...|$|R
