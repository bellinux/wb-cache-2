5|$|Writer Ron Hauge {{said he got}} {{the idea}} for the episode one day when he was heading to work. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> to the radio and heard of an orphanage getting ripped off, and they were getting back more than they gave. The spectators in the stands during Bart's dreams are various animators.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau {{was born}} on August 23, 1970, in Jacksonville, Florida. His father, Craig Mehldau, was a doctor, and his mother, Annette, was a homemaker. His sister, Leigh Anne, became a social worker. There was always a piano in the house during Mehldau's childhood, and he {{initially}} listened to pop and rock music on the radio. His family moved to West Hartford, Connecticut, when Mehldau was 10. Up to this point he had played mostly simple pop tunes and exercises from books, but the move brought him a new piano teacher, who introduced him to classical music. This new interest lasted for a few years, but {{by the age of}} 14 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> more to jazz, including recordings by saxophonist John Coltrane and pianist Oscar Peterson.|$|E
5|$|West made a {{conscious}} decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was brought on by the alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> to at that time.|$|E

On the same day, Rajoelina held a rally nearby, with about 10,000 in attendance.|$|E
25|$|ZDNET {{characterized}} the sound as clean, crisp, and authentic. The reviewer {{also noted that}} {{it seemed like he}} was in the recording studio with the bands and he has not heard sound this good before.

25|$|On June 6, Woods {{stated that}} he would remain with {{longtime}} agent Mark Steinberg after the agent's contract was not renewed by the International Management Group. The following day, {{he announced that he}} would not be playing in the 2011 U.S. Open, set to begin June 16, due to continued pain in his left Achilles tendon and left anterior cruciate ligament. Woods stated he was very disappointed to be unable to play in the season's second major championship, but that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> to his doctors, continuing to work on his recovery, and planning for the long term. Woods also missed the 2011 British Open, still recovering from injury. He fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams following the AT National in early July; Williams now caddies for Adam Scott.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, May 3 around 8:50p.m. Virgil was {{relaxing}} {{in his chair}} {{in the sitting room}} just off of the kitchen and bedroom with a heating pad on his back. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> to his favorite radio program and reading the Friday, May 3 edition of the Texarkana Gazette when he was shot from a closed double window, which faced the highway, three feet behind him. He was shot {{in the back of the}} head by two slugs and died almost instantly. His funeral, which his recovering wife could not attend, was held the following Monday at his church at 2:30p.m. More than 500 people attended his funeral; more than 60 which were his and his wife's relatives. He was buried in Hillcrest cemetery on Highway 67 West; same cemetery as Paul Martin. He was survived by his wife, parents, sister (Mrs. Millard Boyce, Jr.), brother (Charlie), two nieces, and one nephew.|$|E
500|$|Soon, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> to Hoagy Carmichael, too. A {{law student}} and {{aspiring}} pianist and songwriter, Carmichael invited the Wolverines to Bloomington, Indiana, late in April 1924. Beiderbecke had met Carmichael {{a couple of}} times before and the two became friends. On May 6, 1924, the Wolverines recorded a tune Carmichael had written especially for Beiderbecke and his colleagues: [...] "Riverboat Shuffle".|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh capitally," [...] said Mr Egerton. [...] "He {{has very}} seldom spoken before and always {{slightly}} though well. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>listened</b> to with mute attention; {{never was a}} better house.

500|$|The Pixies are {{influenced}} by a range of artists and genres; each member came from a different musical background. When he first started writing songs for the Pixies, Francis says <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> to nothing but Hüsker Dü, Captain Beefheart, and Iggy Pop; Other influences associated with Francis include The Gun Club and The Cars. During the making of Doolittle he listened heavily to the Beatles' White Album. He has cited Buddy Holly {{as a model for}} his compressed songwriting. Francis did not discover punk rock until he was 16, saying [...] "it was good I didn't listen to these hip records". As a child, he listened mainly to 1960s songs, religious music and Emerson Lake and Palmer, then Iggy Pop, Husker Du, Captain Beefheart and Talking Heads, who he says [...] "weren't punk either".|$|E
500|$|Noel Gallagher {{began working}} on [...] "Live Forever" [...] in 1991, while working for a {{building}} company {{in his hometown of}} Manchester. After his foot was crushed by a pipe in an accident, he was given a less-strenuous job working in the storeroom, allowing him more time to write songs. One night, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> to the Rolling Stones' album Exile on Main St.; while playing one of his own chord progressions, Gallagher noted that it sounded good against one of the vocal melodies from the album: [...] "It was the bit from [...] "Shine a Light" [...] that goes , [...] "May the good Lord shine a light on you"", Gallagher recalled. Gallagher incorporated the melody, changing the line to [...] "Maybe I don't really want to know". For a period afterwards, that was {{the only part of the}} song Gallagher had completed.|$|E
500|$|Davies also {{attempts}} to channel his writing by using music that fits {{the theme of}} the series as a source of inspiration: Doctor Who was typically written while he listened to action-adventure film scores; Queer as Folk was written to Hi-NRG music [...] "to catch [...] sheer clubland drive"; Bob & Rose was written to the Moby album Play, because the two works shared an [...] "urban, sexy, full of lonely hearts at night" [...] image; and The Second Coming shared the concepts of [...] "experimental, anguish, dark, [...] pain" [...] of Radiohead albums. More specifically, he wrote the early drafts of the fourth series Doctor Who episode [...] "Partners in Crime" [...] while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> to Mika's Life in Cartoon Motion, and singled out the song [...] "Any Other World" [...] as a [...] "Doctor Who companion song" [...] with lyrics that matched Penny, the planned companion for the fourth series.|$|E
60|$|When Miriam, {{returning}} to the mother-of-pearl music-stool, at a signal from her brother, touched the silver and enamelled keys of the ivory piano, and began to sing, Lord Codlingsby felt as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> {{at the gates of}} Paradise, or were hearing Jenny Lind.|$|R

Suddenly, some men in dark-coloured suits force the string quartet members to leave the stage. Shocked and disbelieving at what they have just witnessed, the Goodies go home.|$|R
500|$|Pierre has {{in retrospect}} labeled {{half of the}} album's writing as being {{completed}} while inebriated {{and the other half}} while getting sober. For example, he penned the lyrics to [...] "Attractive Today" [...] and [...] "Time Turned Fragile" [...] while drunk in his apartment, in a [...] "sad and lonely place." [...] In this approach, words mostly [...] "just came out," [...] and were not substantially revised. In addition, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> to the 2003 album Reconstruction Site by the Weakerthans, and found himself inspired by the songwriting of frontman John K. Samson. Pierre would often take lyrics from other bands songs for song titles; [...] "Time Turned Fragile" [...] is lifted from a lyric in Limbeck's [...] "Julia", while [...] "Together We'll Ring in the New Year" [...] was pulled from the Tom Waits song [...] "Please Wake Me Up". [...] "L.G. FUAD"—which stands for [...] "Let's Get Fucked Up and Die"—grew out of a night on Motion City Soundtrack's 2003 UK tour with The All-American Rejects, in which the latter band's merchandise manager was severely inebriated. He stood on the merchandise stand and shouted what became the song's refrain. All involved found great humor in the [...] "mantra", which went on to be printed on business cards as a joke. [...] "Hold Me Down" [...] was inspired by a former roommate of Pierre's. After she had moved out, Pierre found a portion of her math homework in a couch cushion, leading to him imagining a scenario of finding a letter from a departed lover.|$|E
500|$|Harding went to {{bed early}} in the evening of July 27, 1923. Later that night, he called for his physician, Charles E. Sawyer, {{complaining}} of pain in the upper abdomen. Sawyer thought it was a recurrence of a dietary upset, but Dr. Joel T. Boone suspected a heart problem. The next day, as the train rushed to San Francisco, Harding felt better, and when they arrived on the morning of July 29, 1923, he insisted on walking from the train to the car, which rushed him to the Palace Hotel where he suffered a relapse. Doctors found that not only was Harding's heart causing problems, but he also had pneumonia, a serious matter in the days before effective antibiotics. When treated with caffeine and digitalis, Harding seemed to improve. He was pleased when his planned foreign policy address advocating membership in the World Court was released to the press by Hoover and received a favorable reception. By the afternoon of August 2, 1923, doctors allowed Harding to sit up in bed. That evening, about 7:30 pm, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> to his wife read him a flattering article about him from The Saturday Evening Post, [...] "A Calm Review of a Calm Man". When she paused to plump his pillows, he said, [...] "That's good, read some more". As Florence Harding resumed, her husband twisted convulsively and collapsed, and she raced to get the doctors. They attempted stimulants, but were unable to revive him, and President Harding {{died of a heart attack}} on August 2, 1923, at the age of 57. His death was initially attributed to a cerebral hemorrhage, as doctors at the time did not generally understand the symptoms of a heart attack.|$|E
500|$|In May 2014, {{photographer}} Mert Alas {{posted on}} his Instagram account that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> {{to a new}} Madonna album, but Billboard clarified {{that she was still}} in the process of recording it in Los Angeles. They later posted a 50-second snippet of an instrumental which media claimed to be from Madonna, but the sample was traced back to Dutch DJ Sander Kleinenberg and his song [...] "We Are Superstars". Oseary confirmed that Madonna looked forward to a 2015 release date for the album. However, on November 28, 2014, two songs titled [...] "Rebel Heart" [...] and [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] were leaked onto the Internet; the songs were immediately taken down, and Oseary tweeted asking for assistance in finding the source of the leaks. On December 17, 2014, a total of thirteen songs were leaked, as well as artwork suggesting the album was to be named Iconic. An aggravated Madonna clarified that the songs were demo versions from earlier recordings; she described the leak as [...] "artistic rape". The singer was also criticized for referring to the hack as [...] "terrorism", due to the then-recent Peshawar school massacre and the Sydney hostage crisis. Madonna said in a Billboard interview that after the leak she and her team tried to trace it back to the source, but ultimately decided to release the finished songs. Referring to the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, she was critical of the Internet and explained that the incident led to her securing her laptop and hard drives, and disabling the Wi-Fi. [...] "I wanted to plan everything in advance. Release the single, shoot a video, start talking about my record. And you know, prepare for the release of the entire album and have everything set up just so... But we sort of were left with no choice", she added.|$|E

50|$|The singing {{style and}} the {{conventions}} of vocal delivery for the play closely resembles the form of singing in an old-fashioned drama genre known as 'Satyabhamakalapam'. Accompanied only by the drum and finger cymbals, the player sings raising his hand up to one ear, as if to <b>listen</b> to what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>listening.</b>|$|R
60|$|Late in September President Roosevelt {{returned}} to Washington, and on October 15 delivered the principal {{address at the}} unveiling of a statue of that grand military hero, General Sherman.

2500|$|The album {{has a more}} pop punk sound {{compared}} to Can't Slow Down, which was a melodic hardcore-driven record. Allmusic reviewer Vincent Jeffries described the record's sound as [...] "emocore". Conley explained that the shift in sound came from the music <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> to. He liked several hardcore bands, but had played their albums [...] "to death" [...] and wanted to look for other sources of inspiration. While working on Through Being Cool, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> to: the Foo Fighters' The Colour and the Shape (1997), Weezer's Pinkerton (1996), and Joni Mitchell's Blue (1971) among others.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} media critics, {{including}} Toronto Sun columnist and former radio personality Ted Woloshyn, criticized CP24 Radio 1050 {{as a poor}} substitute for a true news radio format.

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2015, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann and Bob Weir joined with guitarist John Mayer, keyboardist Jeff Chimenti, and bassist Oteil Burbridge to tour in a band called Dead & Company. Mayer recounts that in 2011 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> to Pandora and {{happened}} upon the Grateful Dead song [...] "Althea", and that soon Grateful Dead music was all he would listen to. The band has played three tours: [...] October–December 2015, June–July 2016, and May–July 2017.|$|E
