Balls {{are subject to the}} international tennis federation’s (ITF) ball approval process, which includes a <b>degradation</b> <b>test</b> to ensure a minimum standard of performance. The aim of this investigation was to establish if the ITF <b>degradation</b> <b>test</b> can assess ball longevity and rate of degradation and determine if {{there is a need for}} a new <b>degradation</b> <b>test</b> that is more representative of in-play conditions. Ball tracking data from four different professional events, spanning the three major court surfaces, including both men’s and women’s matches were analysed. The frequency of first serves, second serves, racket impacts and surface impacts were assessed and the corresponding distribution of ball speed and (for surface impacts) impact angle was determined. Comparison of ball impact frequency and conditions between in-play data and the ITF <b>degradation</b> <b>test</b> indicated the development of a new test, more representative of in-play data, would be advantageous in determining ball longevity and rate of degradation with use. Assessment of data from different surfaces highlighted that grass court subjected the ball to fewer racket and surface impacts than hard court or clay. In turn, this appears to influence the distribution of ball speed on impact with the surface or racket, suggesting a surface-specific <b>degradation</b> <b>test</b> may be beneficial.

In this study, first we use drift Brownian motion to model a typical SSADT performance degradation process. Then, under the situation that total experiment cost is not given while the sample size, total test time and the interval of performance inspection are specified, our objective is to minimize the asymptotic variance of the estimation of {{the reliability of the}} p th quantile of product’s lifetime under use condition.

A statistical procedure with the proposed power model is then derived for the CS paths of LED lamps in step-loaded stress testing. Two types of commercial LED lamps with different capabilities of heat dissipation (CHDs) are investigated. Results show that the color coordinates of lamps are easily modified in various stress-loaded conditions, and different CHDs of lamps may {{play a crucial role}} in the various CS processes. Furthermore, the proposed statistic power model is adequate for the CS process of LED lamps. The consistency of CS mechanisms in step-loaded stress testing can also be detected effectively by applying the proposed statistic procedure with the power model.

40|$|The {{properties}} {{and the structure}} of biodegradable polymers alter during degradation. The conventional way to study material {{properties and}} degradation requires direct contact with the material. For example monitoring the degradation of biodegradable implants inside a human body is challenging. Changes in the biodegradable polymers can be wirelessly monitored using resonance circuits. However, the circuits have to be protected from the surrounding environment {{in order for them to}} work properly. A protective layer around the circuit prevents water penetration to the circuits and enables observing the material changes. The aim of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of three biodegradable polymers for encapsulating resonance circuits. The circuits were encapsulated by poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA 80 / 20), poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PDLGA 85 / 15), and poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA 10 / 90) using compression molding. The resonance behaviors of the encapsulated circuits were wirelessly measured in order to evaluate the success and the duration of the encapsulation. In addition, a <b>degradation</b> <b>test</b> series was carried out to compare the resonance behavior and the degradation. The comparison was done in order to find out if changes in material properties could be obtained by measuring wirelessly the resonance behavior of the encapsulated circuits. The study revealed that the encapsulation using compression molding was possible with PLGA 80 / 20 and PDLGA 85 / 15 materials. The PLGA 80 / 20 capsules worked even for 14 weeks and the PDLGA 85 / 15 capsules for 7 weeks. The PLGA 10 / 90 capsules lasted only few days and failed due to rapid degradation of the capsules. The <b>degradation</b> <b>test</b> showed that the properties and the appearance of the PLGA 80 / 20 hardly changed. The properties of the PDLGA 85 / 15 decreased continuously during the <b>degradation</b> <b>test</b> and were weaker than the properties of the PLGA 80 / 20. The structure of the PDLGA 85 / 15 samples changed significantly due to autocatalysis. The study also revealed that the properties of the PLGA 10 / 90 samples were the weakest and the samples were totally fragmented after six weeks. The visual characterization of the encapsulated circuits and the <b>degradation</b> <b>test</b> samples suggested that water absorption could have caused the characteristic resonance behavior of each material. However, the results from the <b>degradation</b> <b>test</b> series do not explain the resonance behavior even though some similarities could be obtained.

The introduction of biodegradable materials, which can be disposed directly into the soil, can be one possible solution to this problem. The objectives of this work were to produce biodegradable biocomposite films and study the characterization of starch-based films blended with chitosan and whey protein. The films were synthesized by using the mixing process and the casting method. The characteristics of the blend films with different tapioca starch composition (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 g/ 100 mL) were evaluated using Universal Testing Machine, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation and biodegradability using microbiological <b>degradation</b> <b>test</b> and soil burial <b>degradation</b> <b>test.</b> Among them, the biodegradable blend films compatibilized with 1 % of tapioca starch content showed good mechanical properties and had the highest thermal stability.

In this circumstance, assessing product reliability based on degradation data at high stress levels becomes necessary. These tests are called accelerated <b>degradation</b> <b>tests.</b> There {{is a need to}} scientifically design these test plans. A good test plan can save time and expense, and provide more accurate estimates of reliability for the same number of test units and test time. To address this problem, a four-step-approach for the optimum planning of accelerated <b>degradation</b> <b>tests</b> is proposed in this study.

40|$|One major {{drawback}} of the post-combustion CO 2 capture using conventional amine solvents is solvent degradation, {{which can}} be due to thermal as well as oxidative mechanisms. Degradation affects the CO 2 capture process since it may cause corrosion, foaming and fouling, possibly inducing a decrease of the solvent efficiency and high additional operating costs due to solvent replacement. In order to study degradation of conventional amine solvents as well as degradation of novel solvents, a <b>degradation</b> <b>test</b> rig has been built at the University of Liège {{in collaboration with the}} company Laborelec, member of the GDF SUEZ group. Since degradation generally occurs within a few months in real plant conditions, this equipment has been designed to allow the study of different degradation mechanisms under accelerated conditions, at high temperatures (up to 140 °C) and high partial pressures in oxygen and CO 2 (total pressure up to 20 bar with varying gas composition). An advantage of this <b>degradation</b> <b>test</b> rig is that it can be used in batch as well as in semi-batch mode with constant gas flow. High gas-liquid contact efficiency is also ensured thanks to a mechanical agitation system combined with gas bubbling. For a typical run, 300 g of aqueous amine solution (30 wt % MEA in water) is introduced into the reactor and degraded during two weeks. The degraded solutions are then analysed using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for MEA quantification and gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID) for the characterization of degradation products.

40|$|Many failure {{mechanisms}} {{can be traced}} to underlying degradation processes. Degradation eventually leads to a weakness that can cause a failure for products. When it is possible to measure degradation, such data often provide more information than traditional failure-time data for purposes of assessing and improving product reliability. For some products, however, degradation rates at use conditions are so low that appreciable degradation will not be observed in a test of practical time length. In such cases, {{it might be possible to}} use some accelerating variables (e. g., temperature, voltage, or pressure) to accelerate the degradation processes. In today 2 ̆ 7 s manufacturing industries, accelerated destructive degradation tests (ADDTs) are widely used to obtain timely product reliability information. In designing an experiment, decisions must be made before data collection, and data collection is usually restricted by limited resources. Careful test planning is crucial for efficient use of limited resources: test time, test units, and test facilities. The basic goal in designing an experiment is to improve the statistical inference for the quantities of interest by selecting appropriate test conditions to minimize or control the variability of the estimator of interest. Generally, an ADDT plan specifies a set of testing conditions and the corresponding allocations of test units to each condition. In this dissertation, we study the test planning methods for designing accelerated destructive degradation tests from three aspects, including non-Bayesian and Bayesian methods. First, Chapter 2 presents the non-Bayesian methods for accelerated destructive <b>degradation</b> <b>test</b> planning when there is only one failure cause for the testing products.
