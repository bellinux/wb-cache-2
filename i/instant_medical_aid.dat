40|$|Health care {{utilization}} has progressively increased, {{especially among}} <b>Medical</b> <b>Aid</b> beneficiaries in South Korea. The <b>Medical</b> <b>Aid</b> classifies beneficiaries into two categories, type 1 and 2, {{on the basis}} of being incapable (those under 18 or over 65 years of age, or disabled) or capable of working, respectively. <b>Medical</b> <b>Aid</b> has a high possibility for health care utilization due to high coverage level. In South Korea, the national health insurance (NHI) achieved very short time to establish coverage for the entire Korean population. However there there remaine a number of problems to be solved. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the differences in health care utilization between <b>Medical</b> <b>Aid</b> beneficiaries and Health Insurance beneficiaries. Data were collected from the Korean Welfare Panel Study from 2008 to 2012 using propensity score matching. Of the 2, 316 research subjects, 579 had <b>Medical</b> <b>Aid</b> and 1, 737 had health insurance. We also analyzed three dependent variables: days spent in the hospital, number of outpatient visits, and hospitalizations per year. Analysis of variance and longitudinal data analysis were used. The number of outpatient visits was 1. 431 times higher (p< 0. 0001) in <b>Medical</b> <b>Aid</b> beneficiaries, the number of hospitalizations per year was 1. 604 times higher (p< 0. 0001) in <b>Medical</b> <b>Aid</b> beneficiaries, and the number of days spent in the hospital per year was 1. 282 times higher (p< 0. 268) for <b>Medical</b> <b>Aid</b> beneficiaries than in individuals with Health Insurance. <b>Medical</b> <b>Aid</b> patients had a 0. 874 times lower frequency of having an unmet needs due to economic barrier (95 % confidence interval: 0. 662 - 1. 156). Health insurance coverage has an impact on health care utilization. More health care utilization among <b>Medical</b> <b>Aid</b> beneficiaries appears to have a high possibility of a moral hazard risk under the Health Insurance program. Therefore, the moral hazard for <b>Medical</b> <b>Aid</b> beneficiaries should be avoided...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the business models being used by <b>medical</b> <b>aid</b> societies in order to survive in a turbulent economic environment experienced by Zimbabwe between 2005 and 2013. The turbulent economic environment caused operational difficulties for most <b>medical</b> <b>aid</b> societies like failure to meet claims costs, diversification into questionable non core activities and skyrocketing costs of doing business. These challenges threatened the long term survival of societies, therefore the study delved deep to understand what can be done to guarantee long term survival of the societies. The research followed a positivist or quantitative research philosophy. A deductive approach was used. The study used a survey research strategy and the time horizon was cross-sectional as opposed to longitudinal. The study had a population of about 36 650 people and a sample of 200 people received questionnaires. The respondents were split across <b>medical</b> <b>aid</b> subscribers, employees, shareholders and managers of various <b>medical</b> <b>aid</b> societies. The sample was arrived at using the stratified random and convenience sampling techniques. The study relied on primary sources of data. Collected data was analyzed by the SPSS software. <b>Medical</b> <b>aid</b> societies are following efficiency based business models which lack robust value chains.
