40|$|The {{symmetric}} coordinates {{are very}} popular method to model unbalanced faults in power system analysis. It {{is not only}} easy to <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> a single fault, but also it can be extended to multiple faults. But {{it is not easy}} to <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> situations whose unbalanced situations change continuously, like a SVC (Static Var Compensator) with unbalanced fault in power system or an unbalanced nonlinear load. Though, we had proposed a simulation method that can <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> these unbalanced and dynamic situations, it needs to <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> complex unbalanced faults. Under these situations, we will propose more efficient method...|$|R
50|$|A spinner handle is a {{shaft and}} <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> a drive fitting—most {{commonly}} ¼"—at {{the end for}} attaching interchangeable sockets. This allows one to use a single <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> a number of sizes instead of having a separate nut driver for each size. However, a spinner lacks {{the benefit of a}} hollow shaft; thus, a common alternative system is a single <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> interchangeable shafts in each size.|$|R
5|$|Like other rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} {{is regarded}} as having a low degree of toxicity, but its compounds should be <b>handled</b> <b>with</b> care nonetheless: for example, lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin. Lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode and burn once heated. Lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well if inhaled or ingested.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium and {{tellurium}} compounds {{are considered}} to be mildly toxic and need to be <b>handled</b> <b>with</b> care, although acute poisoning is rare. Tellurium poisoning is particularly difficult to treat as many chelation agents used in the treatment of metal poisoning will increase the toxicity of tellurium. Tellurium is not reported to be carcinogenic.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} {{reactive}} nature of potassium metal, it must be <b>handled</b> <b>with</b> great care, with full skin and eye protection and preferably an explosion-resistant barrier between the user and the metal. Ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to hyperkalemia strongly influencing the cardiovascular system. Potassium chloride {{is used in the}} United States for lethal injection executions.|$|E

5|$|Elemental iodine {{is also a}} skin irritant, {{and direct}} contact with skin can cause damage and solid iodine {{crystals}} should be <b>handled</b> <b>with</b> care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.|$|E
5|$|Like their {{relatives}} in the Elapidae family, {{the majority of the}} Hydrophiinae species are highly venomous; however, when bites occur, venom injection is rare, so envenomation symptoms usually seem nonexistent or trivial. For example, P. platurus has a venom more potent than any terrestrial snake species in Costa Rica based on LD50, but despite its abundance in the waters off its western coast, few human fatalities have been reported. Nevertheless, all sea snakes should be <b>handled</b> <b>with</b> great caution.|$|E
5|$|Many, if not all, {{countries}} have {{some degree of}} polyethnicity, with countries like the United States and Canada having large levels and countries like Japan and Poland having very small levels (and more specifically, a sense of homogeneity). The amount of polyethnicity prevalent in some Western countries has spurred some arguments against it, which include a belief that it leads to the weakening of each society's strengths, and also a belief that political-ethnic issues in countries with polyethnic populations are better <b>handled</b> <b>with</b> different laws for certain ethnicities.|$|E

5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} {{with a single}} rudder. The vessels handled well and had a tight turning radius, but they suffered from weather helm and tended to drift while underway. The ships' crew numbered ten officers and 191enlisted men, and later increased to eleven officers and 197enlisted men. The ships carried several smaller boats, including two picket boats, one launch, two yawls, and one dinghy. These were <b>handled</b> <b>with</b> a large derrick that was fitted to the main mast.|$|E
5|$|Thallium and its {{compounds}} {{are extremely}} toxic, and should be <b>handled</b> <b>with</b> care. There are numerous recorded cases of fatal thallium poisoning. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for thallium exposure in the workplace as 0.1mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) also set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 15mg/m3, thallium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E

5|$|Valued for its meat, the finetooth shark {{forms an}} {{important}} component of the commercial gillnet shark fishery operating off the southeastern United States. Population assessments suggest that this fishery does not currently pose a threat to U.S. populations of the species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has therefore listed the finetooth shark under Least Concern, though no fishery data are available for this species off South America. This shark is not known to pose a danger to humans, though it snaps vigorously when captured and should be <b>handled</b> <b>with</b> caution.|$|E
5|$|Early {{researchers}} tasted beryllium and {{its various}} compounds for sweetness {{in order to}} verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt {{should be made to}} ingest this highly toxic substance. Beryllium and its compounds should be <b>handled</b> <b>with</b> great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust (lung cancer is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium-laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.|$|E

5|$|Lanthanum {{has a low}} to {{moderate}} level of toxicity and should be <b>handled</b> <b>with</b> care. The injection of lanthanum solutions produces hyperglycemia, low blood pressure, degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations. The application in carbon arc light led to the exposure of people to rare earth element oxides and fluorides, which sometimes led to pneumoconiosis. As the La3+ ion is similar in size to the Ca2+ ion, it is sometimes used as an easily traced substitute for the latter in medical studies. Lanthanum, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. When injected into the brain, it acts as a painkiller, similarly to morphine and other opiates, though the mechanism behind this is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|Titan Quest is {{an action}} role playing hack and slash video game {{developed}} by Iron Lore Entertainment for Microsoft Windows personal computers. It {{was published by}} THQ in 2006. It was released on Steam in 2007, and later ported to mobile devices by DotEmu and released in 2016: later versions were published by THQ Nordic. The story follows a player-created protagonist as they navigate Ancient Greece, Egypt and China on a quest to defeat the Titans after they escape from their ancient prison. The gameplay {{is similar to the}} Diablo series, with player navigation being <b>handled</b> <b>with</b> a mouse-driven tile-based interface, and gameplay revolving around role-playing mechanics and real-time combat. An expansion, , was released in 2007.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} are highly {{reactive}} and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, {{they are usually}} stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be <b>handled</b> <b>with</b> great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if {{the same number of}} moles of each metal is used. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. Not only do the alkali metals react with water, but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.|$|E
