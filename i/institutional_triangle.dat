50|$|The European Commission, a body {{independent}} of EU governments that upholds the collective European interest, {{is the third}} part of the <b>institutional</b> <b>triangle</b> that manages and runs the European Union. The Commission is assisted by a civil service made up of 36 directorates-general (DGs) and services.|$|E
50|$|The European Union is {{more than}} just a {{confederation}} of countries, but it is not a federal state. The EU policies in general, are the result of decisions taken by the <b>institutional</b> <b>triangle</b> made up of the Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission, all based in Brussels (the EU Parliament hold also in Strasbourg a plenary every month).|$|E

30|$|Behind {{the idea}} of {{widening}} children’s perspectives, some professionals specifically mentioned {{the inability of the}} educational system to stem the production of inequalities. With that in mind, more than one emphasised the added value of recreational activities, especially for disadvantaged children and children with learning disabilities, as well as for children living in a foreign monolingual home environment. Recreational activities were then seen as additional educational environments. In this perspective, the <b>institutional</b> <b>triangle</b> is acknowledged: home, school and recreational activities all form places for educational experiences.|$|E
30|$|In principle, {{recreational}} services under French-speaking authorities aim {{to contribute to}} the development and wellbeing of children, as well as to social inclusion. They do not, as such, target educational benefits. When confronting parents’ perspectives on the institutional discourse—as of school professionals we interviewed—about the benefits of recreational activities for children’s wellbeing, we see the proximity between user families and school professionals on the one hand, and the distance between voluntary non-user families and school professionals on the other hand. In other words, where users and professionals acknowledge the <b>institutional</b> <b>triangle,</b> voluntary non-users do not. Moreover, it appears that the children who would benefit the most from recreational activities, according to professionals, would be the least likely to resort to these when considering families’ profiles.|$|E
30|$|Besides {{the choice}} {{and nature of}} activities, children’s free time is also {{affected}} by spatial configurations. In urban contexts, children’s free time is as much an issue of space as it is of time. High building density, combined with housing pressure on open spaces, and a higher density of traffic, leading to mobility issues (Oliver et al. 2011), have rendered access to safe and high-standard green spaces and public playgrounds (Allen et al. 2013) an acute challenge. Moreover, {{the rise of a}} risk-averse society (Gill 2006) has led to a withdrawal of children from the streets and, accordingly, some parents await for sustainable options regarding their children’s free time. Besides the needed investments in green spaces and playgrounds in urban environments, comprehensive approaches to children’s access to public space have flourished. UNICEF has, since 1996, advocated in favour of Child Friendly Cities as “places where children’s rights to a healthy, caring, protective, educative, stimulating, non-discriminating, inclusive, culturally rich environment are addressed” (Riggio 2002). A perspective lobbying for a loose and open spatial organisation of cities is one that highlights the need for “children’s places”, which are physical and symbolic places assigned by children for themselves, instead of only “places for children” that are assigned by adults for children (Rasmussen 2004). In fully integrated ECEC systems, children are growingly framed by an <b>institutional</b> <b>triangle</b> of ‘places for children’—the home arena, the school arena and the recreational facility—underestimating children’s experience of restrictions and contradictions. In such circumstances, Rasmussen’s plea leads to the need to investigate the potential effects of such institutionalisation on today’s childhoods and the social space for ‘children’s places’.|$|E
40|$|Introduction]. ON June 10 - 13, 2004, {{voters in}} the 25 member states elected a new European Parliament (EP). Five days later, governments agreed on a Constitution for the EU that {{reinforces}} the legislative role of the EP in numerous areas. This is a unique occasion {{to reflect on the}} evolution of dynamics within the European Parliament and on its relations with other EU institutions. This Forum gathers four recognized experts on the EP and European elections to take stock of changes and continuities in the practices of members of the EP. First, Niilo Kauppi analyzes the key features on the 2004 election campaigns, underscoring previous patterns: low turnout in elections instrumentalized as mid-term elections for the parties in government and the use of celebrities to gather the vote. Next, Michael Shackleton revisits the last five years to underline the evolution {{of the role of the}} EP in the <b>institutional</b> <b>triangle</b> with the Commission and Council. Its increased working relationship with the Council spurred by the co-decision procedure has the potential to leave the Commission less influential on shaping policy output. Olivier Costa focuses on the party dynamics within the EP during the last mandate. While confirming that voting patterns have not changed drastically, he observes some changes in coalitions. Finally, Simon Hix looks towards the future. In his view, although the June results have not significantly altered the partisan composition of the EP and the strength of the main parties, he points to the broader picture; a Center-Right Parliament working with a Council dominated by Center-Right governments and potentially a Commission with many Center-Left representatives. The overall Right-wing partisan balance of three major EU institutions may generate decisions reflecting an ideological standpoint much clearer to read and comprehend for the European {{voters in the}} 2009 elections...|$|E
30|$|Parents {{expressed}} {{a variety of}} perspectives on {{the potential benefits of}} recreational activities for their children’s wellbeing. Three profiles, economically and socio-culturally driven, were drawn out: voluntary non-users, involuntary non-users and users of recreational activities. Where issues of social isolation and economic deprivation explained much of the pattern of involuntary non-users, family educational patterns distinguished the voluntary non-users from the users. Indeed voluntary non-users expressed their choice not to enrol their children in recreational activities, while users did the opposite. However, where choice {{would seem to be a}} core aspect here, one could ask to what extent we can speak of actual choice. Indeed, differences in family resources, in reference to social and cultural capitals (Bourdieu 1979), combined with differences of access to recreational services due to contextual factors (mainly linked to the supply structure and the costs of services), affect families’ capacities to understand the nature of the offer of recreational services, as part of ECEC policies, and thereafter to make real choices for their children. Indeed, all parents showed interest for school and its paramount role in defining their children’s future. But coming back to recreational activities, it seemed we had on the one hand families reproducing habits of using recreational services, and on the other hand families reproducing the habit of not using them. However, the fact that involuntary non-users and users acknowledged the three components of the <b>institutional</b> <b>triangle</b> (Rasmussen 2004)—home, school and recreational services—as part of children’s wellbeing, while voluntary non-user families did not (only home and school were identified), leads us to nuance this perspective. Indeed, the profile of involuntary non-users corresponds to parents most of whom have not experienced these local recreational activities themselves. Yet they perceive these activities as opportunities, which they cannot provide themselves, for their children (Kaat et al. 2011). Individual and contextual factors do appear to produce various perspectives and practices among families concerning recreational activities for their children.|$|E
