Industry participants {{have called for}} changed regulation of the South African petroleum industry. The National Energy Forum task force was established to formulate recommendations concerning future petroleum industry regulation. Government subsequently released a white paper indicating a major shift towards deregulation. Deregulation and a twenty-five percent black economic empowerment (BEE) objective became the future <b>envisaged</b> <b>policy.</b> Government, oil majors, retail associations and retailer representatives were interviewed. Developments in three deregulated countries were analysed and evaluated, {{to determine the effects}} should full deregulation occur. A refined analytical framework was used. The results show that much must be achieved before implementation of full deregulation in South Africa. Government is particularly concerned about supply security, infrastructure requirements, transformation to twenty-five percent BEE and protection against massive unemployment resulting from rationalisation, caused by competitive price-cutting, of approximately 30...|$|E
40|$|Although {{many papers}} have already {{proposed}} empirical models of currency crises, {{the timing of}} such crises has received relatively little attention so far. Most papers use indeed a static specification and impose the same lag structure across all explanatory variables. This, by construction, prevents from specifically timing the crisis signals sent by the leading indicators. The objective here is to fill this gap by considering a set of dynamic discrete choice models. The first contribution is to identify how early in advance each explanatory variable sends a warning signal. Some indicators are found to signal {{a crisis in the}} very short run while others signal a crisis at more distant horizons. The second contribution is to show that state dependence matters, albeit mostly in the short run. The results have important implications for crisis prevention in terms of the timeliness and usefulness of the <b>envisaged</b> <b>policy</b> response.

The situation {{in relation to}} Sri Lanka is no different—both {{in relation to the}} complexity of the subject and the investigation and literature it has generated. Within the international debates, Sri Lanka has been used extensively as a case study as in the early work on the basic needs and growth versus welfare debates, UNICEF’s work on Adjustment with a Human Face and more recently in the World Bank’s Voices of the Poor qualitative study. The domestic research and literature has been as prolific, the most recent group being the background material for the Framework on Poverty Reduction. 1 This paper will not attempt to summarise the existing debates and literature or provide a comprehensive overview to poverty and its many facets in Sri Lanka. Instead it will briefly place Sri Lanka in the context of South Asia and look at the policy framework which brought about the present situation and the ongoing and <b>envisaged</b> <b>policy</b> changes. Finally it will highlight a few selected issues which are of growing interest and have received relatively less attention. A selected bibliography is provided at the end. ...|$|E

40|$|Philippine {{industrial}} policies such {{as those}} bearing on the manufacturing sector are a critical element of the country's development strategy. Manufacturing creates opportunities for higher value-addition and extensive employment owing to forward and backward linkages with other sectors of the economy, and linkage to regional production networks, {{which has become a}} key factor in the growth of major ASEAN countries. This paper discusses Philippine industrial policy reforms and implementation over the period 1973 - 2014 through the lens of the automotive manufacturing industry. It discusses the factors that will facilitate or will hinder the process of reforms and implementation under the new approach {{to the development of the}} automotive manufacturing industry. Information externalities and coordination failure seem to constitute the major challenges to the sector. Under the Philippine New Industrial Policy a more nuanced set of targeted interventions is employed to achieve <b>envisaged</b> <b>policy</b> goals. Weak state capacity for implementing the reforms and the lack of political will could stand in the way of successful policy implementation. The recent economic performance of the country builds the case for intensifying the policy reform process. While there are no easy pathways in the reform process, successful implementation of the new industrial policy will also be conditional on the political leadership and bureaucratic capacity across a number of government agencies. Credible leadership and ownership by bureaucrats as well as other stakeholders while necessary are not a sufficient condition for the success of reform efforts. Equally important is the buy-in or ownership of those reform efforts by the polity...|$|E

Here, information on the projected emissions in 2010 was reported, along with adopted and <b>envisaged</b> <b>policies</b> to further reduce emissions, and quantified estimates of the effect of such policies and measures. Emission calculations for this report have been done by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (RIVM/MNP). Results of these calculations are documented here. Emission reductions are calculated for a package of 12 <b>policy</b> options <b>envisaged</b> by the Dutch Government; however social and political support for these envisaged measures was not considered. Such social and political support has however been taken aboard in the official government report to the commission. The RIVM/MNP analysis shows the technically feasible reduction potential of the assessed package of measures for SO 2, NOx and NH 3 as being apparently sufficient for meeting the national EU emission obligations in 2010. The emission ceiling for NMVOC will only just be reached with the envisaged measures. Additional NMVOC measures should be explored if Dutch government is to be sure of reaching the NMVOC ceiling in 2010...|$|R

40|$|Housing is a complex, emotive {{and highly}} contested policy area. In recent decades, {{there have been}} {{significant}} conflicts over the policy directions pursued by national governments. In the vacuum created by this lack of consensus, policy-making has become circumscribed, reactive and highly volatile. As a result, governments have failed to provide adequate responses to what many perceive to be a worsening housing situation. This paper reviews the applicability of John Kingdon's Garbage Can model of agenda setting and alternative specification for understanding the complexities of policy-making in the housing context. Garbage can theories reject conventional 'policy cycle' models which <b>envisage</b> <b>policy</b> development processes as rational and underpinned by the logic of problem solving. For Kingdon, policy making is chaotic, random and frequently arational. There is a loose relationship between problems and the policy solutions offered by national governments. Using housing case studies from the Australian context, this paper explains {{the principles of the}} garbage can theory and evaluates their usefulness. It concludes that certain modifications are required to apply the model outside of the American institutional context. With certain adaptations, this paper argues that the garbage can model is a powerful descriptive and explanatory model for understanding complex housing policy-making processes. By providing a model for understanding the forces which drive irrational and reactive policy change, it is hoped that the groundwork will be laid for pursuing a more genuinely problem-solving approach in housing policy. The paper pays particular attention to current housing reform directions in Australia, including initiatives to marketise the delivery of housing assistance...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of this thesis, I first {{presented}} the theoretical background of the energy performance of buildings and ways to enable it in accordance with the <b>envisaged</b> <b>policies</b> and legislation. For this I have a theoretical basis to substantiate the analysis that I have carried out with help of software tools TEDI and TOST, in which I discussed about dwelling houses in Logatec. I'm using the program TEDI for analysis of the thermal transmittance of building envelope construction kits. The values did not reach the current regulations, the facility has been built under previous standards in 2008, which were much more lenient than requirements above PURES 2010. I was forced to apply appropriate approaches, with whom I fell transition heat through the building envelope. The requirements will be up to 31. 12. 2020 still further aggravated because all newly constructed buildings will have to meet the characteristics of almost 0 -energy houses.

40|$|Background: Obesity is {{a growing}} problem worldwide. A number of obesity {{policies}} have been introduced, however {{little is known about}} the impact of these polices on the motivation and behaviour of individuals. Methods: 17 individuals who find it difficult to control their weight took part in semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and interpreted using Self-Determination theory. Results: All participants felt that policy intervention was needed, but only participants who were autonomously motivated to lose weight perceived current policies as helpful to achieving their personal goals. Those who were not autonomously motivated did not take advantage of opportunities that obesity-related policies can provide (e. g. food labelling). Barriers to engagement with policy approaches included perceptions of uniqueness, and a lack of social support. Discussion: The results suggest that despite theoretical support for obesity policies, individuals find it difficult to <b>envisage</b> how <b>policies</b> could help them control their weight...|$|R

40|$|The {{trade off}} between ecology and economy {{has become an}} {{important}} issue {{in the evaluation of}} planned interventions in the Dutch coast. The complexity of the issue is reflected by the long and difficult national debates that these interventions cause. Both public policy makers and private stakeholders seem to be in need of instruments to support the lengthy decision making process. The aim {{of this article is to}} discuss what type of instrument is needed to facilitate the decision making process by addressing the following research questions: (1) Can the way in which stakeholders are dealing with nature in practice, be explained by their basic views on nature? (2) Can trends in public policies be explained by these views on nature? The answers to these two questions are obtained by conducting a survey among public and private parties involved in a case study of a planned intervention and a historical review of policies in the field of nature conservation and coastal zone management. The findings are translated into a description of necessary decision support instruments. In order to explain how stakeholders wish to deal with nature in land use plans, a framework of attitudes towards nature, basic views of Conservation, Development and Coevolution, views on nature in the region and design strategies is used. Both the case study and the historical review reveal that the views of Conservation, Development and Coevolution coexist within Dutch society, but a strong tendency towards the Coevolution view can be discerned. According to the Coevolution view, both society and nature are allowed to change and to inflict change upon each other as long as sustainability prospects are enhanced both for society and nature. Though the Coevolution view is very attractive intellectually, it is still in its infancy and the <b>envisaged</b> <b>policies</b> remain quite vulnerable due to a lack of adequate instruments to internalize the value of nature in economic transactions. Though theoretical concepts, such as socio-economic valuation, are available to facilitate the trade off between ecology and economy, these still lack practical applicability. Even if appropriate decision supportive instruments are developed, society is likely to bounce back to a Conservation approach in its actual decision making, as long as there are no institutional and legal arrangements to ensure their use...|$|R
