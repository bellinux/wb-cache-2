5|$|Charles Guinand Blackader {{was born}} in Richmond, Surrey on 20 September 1869. His father, Charles George Blackader, was a teacher to {{a small number of}} {{boarding}} pupils; he had come from an Army family, and taught at Cheltenham College and Clifton College, Bristol, before moving to private tuition. His mother, Charlotte Guinand, {{was born in}} Germany; her <b>family</b> <b>may</b> have come from Alsace-Lorraine, as Blackader would later describe himself as half-French. During his childhood, the Blackaders moved from Richmond to Southampton, where his father headed the education department at the Hartley Institute, and then to Boulogne, where he taught at Beaurepaire School.|$|E
5|$|During the war the Wallenberg bank, Stockholms Enskilda Bank {{collaborated with}} the German government. The Secretary of the US Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. {{considered}} Jacob Wallenberg strongly pro-German, and in 1945 the US Federal Bureau of Investigation subjected the Bank to a blockade from engaging in business in the United States that was only lifted in 1947. Author Alan Lelchuk who interviewed, amongst others, Wallenberg's KGB interrogator, has speculated that the more powerful of the <b>family</b> <b>may</b> {{have chosen not to}} use their influence to locate Raoul as it could have drawn attention to their misdeeds, and they may have considered him an embarrassment, not only for being a man of morality, but his possible homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|Most {{other mammals}} studied, {{including}} the pig, cow, cat, dog, bushbaby, macaque, chimpanzee and orangutan, {{have a single}} Mup gene. Some, however, have an expanded number: horses have three Mup genes and gray mouse lemurs have at least two. Insects, fish, amphibia, birds and marsupials appear to have disrupted synteny at the chromosomal position of the Mup gene cluster, suggesting the gene <b>family</b> <b>may</b> be specific to placental mammals. Humans are the only placental mammals found {{not to have any}} active Mup genes; instead they have a single Mup pseudogene containing a mutation that causes missplicing, rendering it dysfunctional.|$|E
5|$|Pursuit of {{specific}} and narrow {{areas of interest}} {{is one of the}} most striking possible features of AS. Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic. For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography. This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6. Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire <b>family</b> <b>may</b> become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.|$|E
5|$|Sometime in {{the spring}} of 1827, Poe turned over his manuscripts to an 18-year-old printer named Calvin F. S. Thomas, whose <b>family</b> <b>may</b> have been known by Poe's birth parents. Thomas had {{previously}} only printed labels, flyers, and other small jobs. Poe used his own money to pay for the publication of his poems as the 40-page collection Tamerlane and Other Poems, the only known book printed by Thomas. The collection was pamphlet-sized, 6.75 by 4.5 inches. Poe was 18 years old when the collection was released in July 1827 and only 50 copies were printed. The total production number is the subject of dispute; various scholars believe the number was slightly lower (only 20 copies) or substantially higher (as many as 200).|$|E

In the episode, Clark returns from his stint as Jan's sexual assistant and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists his help; the two pose as {{a father and son}} so that they can successfully sell to the owner of a suit warehouse. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) travels to Philadelphia with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to interview at Jim's new company.

5|$|If Echmarcach was {{a son of}} Ragnall mac Gofraid, this {{alliance}} with the Uí Briain {{would have been a}} continuation of amiable relations between the two families. For example, the father of Ragnall mac Gofraid appears to have combined forces with Brian Bóruma in 984, and Ragnall mac Gofraid himself is recorded to have died in Munster, the heartland of the Uí Briain. If, on the other hand, Echmarcach and Cacht were descended from the Waterford dynasty, an alliance between the Uí Briain and this <b>family</b> <b>may</b> have been undertaken {{in the context of a}} struggle between the Uí Briain and the Uí Cheinnselaig. The contemporary leader of the latter kindred was Donnchad's principal opponent, Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster (died 1072). Whilst the Uí Briain certainly allied themselves to Cacht and Echmarcach, Diarmait appears to have backed the descendants of Amlaíb Cuarán, a man whose family appear to have opposed Echmarcach at a latter date.|$|E
5|$|Massospondylus is {{the type}} genus of the {{proposed}} family Massospondylidae, to which it gives its name. The Massospondylidae <b>family</b> <b>may</b> also include Yunnanosaurus, although Lu et al. (2007) placed Yunnanosaurus in its own family. Yates (2007) considered Massospondylus, Coloradisaurus, and Lufengosaurus massospondylids, with Yunnanosaurus in Anchisauria. Smith and Pol (2007) also found a Massospondylidae in their phylogenetic analysis, including Massospondylus, Coloradisaurus, and Lufengosaurus, {{as well as their}} new genus, Glacialisaurus. Adeopapposaurus, based on the fossils once thought to belong to a South American form of Massospondylus, was also classified as a massospondylid, as was Leyesaurus, another South American genus that was named in 2011. Pradhania was originally regarded as a more basal sauropodomorph but new cladistic analysis performed by Novas et al., 2011 suggests that Pradhania is a massospondylid. Pradhania presents two shared traits of the Massospondylidae recovered in their phylogenetic analysis, and the fossils of Pradhania were discovered from the same region and basin in India as M. hislopi.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian monarch, {{seen as the}} fount of honour, is at {{the apex}} of the Order of Canada as its Sovereign, {{followed}} by the governor general, who serves as the fellowship's Chancellor. Thereafter follow three grades, which are, in order of precedence: Companion, Officer, and Member, each having accordant post-nominal letters that members are entitled to use. Each incumbent governor general is also installed as the Principal Companion for the duration of his or her time in the viceregal post and continues as an extraordinary Companion thereafter. Additionally, any governor general, viceregal consort, former governor general, former viceregal consort, or member of the Canadian Royal <b>Family</b> <b>may</b> be appointed as an extraordinary Companion, Officer, or Member. Promotions in grade are possible, though this is ordinarily not done within five years of the initial appointment, and a maximum of five honorary appointments into any of the three grades may be made by the governor general each year. , there have been 21 honorary appointments.|$|E
5|$|The Church of England's three senior bishops—the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of London—become Privy Counsellors upon appointment. Senior {{members of}} the Royal <b>Family</b> <b>may</b> also be appointed, but this is {{confined}} to the current consort and heir apparent and consort. Prince Philip is at present the most senior member by length of service, {{and he is the}} only current Privy Counsellor not appointed by the reigning monarch, having been sworn of the Council by her father. The Private Secretary to the Sovereign is always appointed a Privy Counsellor, as are the Lord Chamberlain, the Speaker of the House of Commons, and the Lord Speaker. Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, senior judges of the Inner House of the Court of Session (Scotland's highest law court) and the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland also join the Privy Council ex officio.|$|E
5|$|The thicker {{end of the}} log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance.

In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its thicker end sticking out from the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In Gruža it is coated with honey which is then licked by children. At the side of ognjište where the thicker end is situated, the <b>family</b> <b>may</b> place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples.
