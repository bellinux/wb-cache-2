40|$|This paper {{discusses}} prehistoric subsistence and {{the development}} of plant husbandry in northeastern Tohoku (northern Honshu). Archaeobotanical sampling was carried out at two sites in eastern Aomori Prefecture. Tominosawa is a Middle Jomon village site which produced a spectrum of nut and weedy plant species similar to that recovered from contemporary sites in southwestern Hokkaido. At the Kazahari site, pithouses from two phases of occupation were sampled for archaeobotanical remains: Tokoshinai IV (c. 1000 B. C.) and Fukurashima (c. 150 B. C.). The pithouse deposits produced evidence for Late Jomon rice, foxtail millet, and broomcorn millet dating to the first millennium B. C. Sampling of later Fukurashima contexts produced evidence of rice, foxtail and broomcorn <b>millet,</b> <b>Japanese</b> barnyard <b>millet,</b> and hemp. These data demonstrate that rice and millets have been present in northeastern Tohoku since c. 1000 B. C., and that farming systems were in place during later Fukurashima occupations. Ecological and ethnographic evidence is used to postulate that plant husbandry was possible in the area during Tokoshinai IV. It is concluded that the northward dispersal of rice was more rapid than was previously thought, and consequently that this movement may not have been greatly affected by cultural and ecological constraints. In addition, rice cultivation dispersed into northeastern Japan independently of wet-paddy technology. KEYWORDS: Japan, Tohoku, Jomon, subsistence, cultivation...|$|R

Integrating wetland creation with tailings basin reclamation provided the necessary wetland acreage for regulatory compliance. The {{properties of the}} tailings and {{the design of the}} basins provided not only a suitable medium and location for wetland creation, but also presented substantial challenges. The creation of new wetlands required manipulation of the water levels within the basins and careful wetland design. Michigan Department of Environmental Quality permits required creating emergent, scrub/shrub, and forested wetland communities on neutral tailings. Numerous planting and seeding techniques were used to establish the different plant communities. These techniques included dormant seeding, drill seeding, aerial seeding, and transplanting wetland vegetation.

LittleCharcoal rot, {{caused by}} Macrophomina phaseolina, {{is the most}} {{important}} soybean disease in Kansas. Several strategies have been recommended to control this disease including crop rotation, lower plant densities, biological control, plant resistance and tolerance, and fungicide application. However, those techniques have not been completely effective and the information concerning soil texture, irrigation and micronutrient fertility (particularly manganese) upon charcoal rot disease severity and the pathogen population is limited. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine key factors that affect the biology of M. phaseolina and charcoal rot processes under laboratory, greenhouse and field conditions. M. phaseolina microsclerotia were produced from PDA pure isolate and infested <b>Japanese</b> <b>millet</b> in the laboratory and characterized by different techniques such as serial dilutions in semi selective media with the aim to produce quality inoculum to reliably infect soybean seedling roots under greenhouse conditions; production of inoculum by infesting <b>Japanese</b> <b>millet</b> was the most efficient method. Root colonization and root infection of soybean seedlings was assessed through the use of M. phaseolina inoculum under controlled conditions in the greenhouse. Root infection by M. phaseolina and microsclerotia longevity in soil is determined by environmental factors such as soil moisture content, soil texture and source of inoculum. The objective of the greenhouse study was to determine the impact of these variables on seedling root infection at the V 1 and V 2 development stages. Artificial soils with different textures were infested; M. phaseolina microsclerotia and soybean seedlings were exposed to different soil moisture contents including pot saturation, pot (field) capacity, and permanent wilting point. Soil populations and levels of root colonization for the stages were assessed by estimating CFUs and root length. Results indicate that soil texture has a significant impact upon root morphology and root length. Root populations of M. phaseolina were significantly higher in sandy soil textures and lower in the fine-textured soils, suggesting an impact of soil water holding capacity in the root infection process. The effect of water stress on seedling root colonization by M. phaseolina indicates that early infection may be more important than previously thought. A field study was also conducted to determine the effect of the aforementioned variables in a 2 -year field experiment conducted at two Kansas locations. Pathogen colonization was iii assessed by measuring colony-forming units (CFUs) from ground root tissue at R 2 -R 4 (post-flowering/early pod development) and R 8 (maturity) stages. Soil populations (pre-planting and post-harvest) of M. phaseolina, yield parameters, and plant characteristics were obtained. Results indicated that there are complex relationships between soil physiochemical properties (pH, NPK content, exchangeable cations, and organic matter) and soil texture (sand, soil, and clay composition), which may mitigate disease severity and pathogen levels in host tissue. Results also indicated that in natural M. phaseolina-infested soils, cropping history and soil texture play an important role in charcoal rot processes and influence the levels of pathogen soil populations, root colonization at maturity and, more importantly, soybean yield...|$|E

Weed competition was investigated by growing sorghum in {{the presence or absence}} of a model grass weed, <b>Japanese</b> <b>millet</b> (Echinochloa esculenta). The correlation analyses showed that the early growth traits (height, shoot biomass, and daily growth rate of the shoot biomass) of sorghum adversely affected the height, biomass, and seed production of millet, as measured at maturity. "MR Goldrush" and "Bonus MR" were the most competitive cultivars, resulting in reduced weed biomass, weed density, and weed seed production. The density of sorghum also had a significant effect on the crop's ability to compete with millet. When compared to the density of 4. 5 plants per m 2, sorghum that was planted at 7. 5 plants per m 2 suppressed the density, biomass, and seed production of millet by 22 %, 27 % and 38 %, respectively. Millet caused a significant yield loss in comparison with the weed-free plots. The combined weed-suppressive effects of the competitive cultivars, such as MR Goldrush, and high crop densities minimized the yield losses from the weeds. These results indicate that sorghum competition against grass weeds can be improved by choosing competitive cultivars and by using a high crop density of > 7. 5 plants per m 2. These non-chemical options should be included in an integrated weed management program for better weed management, particularly where the control options are limited by the evolution of herbicide resistance...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} {{to determine the}} effectiveness of coconut coir blanket in controlling slope erosion was conducted. There were two major division of testing made. One was the material analysis on the soil sample taken and the coconut coir blanket used and another was the simulation of rainfall pouring on sloped surface soil to analyze the erosion rate. Apparently, the division of material testing involved Soil Mechanics Engineering and Light Structure Engineering. Soil Mechanics Engineering assisted this research in soil analyzing {{in terms of the}} Soil Classification, Atterberg Limit, Specific Gravity, Shear Strength, Standard Proctor and Direct Shear testing. On the other hand, Light Structure Engineering focused on Tensile Strength of the coconut coir blanket. Generally, the major testing was the simulation of rainfall on the sloped surface soil. The soil sample which was taken from construction site in Bukit Gambang,. Pahang was distributed into four cases. The parameters manipulated were the degree of slope, type of vegetation and the condition of the slope surface. The selected degree of slope were 0 °, 400 and 500. The vegetations planted were based on the norm slopes grasses used which were the Signal Grass and <b>Japanese</b> <b>Millet.</b> The conditions of the slope surface were divided into two. They were bare controlled case and protected slope case using coconut coir blanket. The main parameter which was the application of coconut coir blanket as the protection to the slope was proven effective. By comparing the bare controlled slope and the protected slope, the result showed that protected slope using the coconut coir blanket decreases the erosion rate by the Total Suspended Solids (TSS) test conducted. The bare controlled slope collected 0. 014345 g/L amount of TSS while protected slope using coconut coir blanket collected only 0. 001368 g/L. The difference of 0. 0 12977 g/L TSS amount proved that coconut coir blanket was effective in controlling slope erosion assisted by the vegetation of Signal Grass which has longer leaves and gripping fibre roots in increasing the mode of slope strength. ...|$|E
40|$|Unpredictable rainstorms {{can pose}} greater risks of soil erosion on newly formed {{unprotected}} railway batters. Bio-engineering approach consisting of revegetation {{can be an}} effective tool for soil erosion control. Perennial species, such as buffel grass, are preferred for durability of vegetation cover in the arid and semi-arid tropics. However, it takes relatively longer time to establish buffel compared with the annual species such as <b>Japanese</b> <b>millet</b> (JM). A replicated plot-scale field trials consisting of different proportions of grass seed mixtures of buffel and JM was conducted on railway batters slope in the semi-arid tropics of central Queensland, Australia. Supplementary automated drip irrigation system was set up to aid seed germination and early establishment of the grass cover. JM alone or JM dominated seed mixtures significantly reduced soil erosion during the earlier stages. For example, during the second sampling interval, which occurred 63 days after seeding, JM alone reduced soil erosion by 50 % (20. 2 vs 10. 21 t/ha) compared with the sole buffel. This trendbegan to shift as the growth of buffel took up at the latter stages. By the end of the 11 months, erosion from all seeded plots was not significantly different from each other with over 90 % soil loss reduction compared to the bare scenario as a result of over 60 % grass cover. Results suggested that a monoculture of JM, or JM dominated seed mixture with buffel grass, could be an effective bioengineering approach for revegetation of railway batters for protection against soil erosion. Quick establishment due to faster seed germination, seedling establishments and growth producing sizable canopy cover developed by JM in early stage of batter could reduce soil erosioncompared to sole crop of slow growing perennial species, buffel. The established vegetation, self regenerated, and responded dynamically and naturally to changing conditions of the railway batter within a year, after which JM started to die back...|$|E
40|$|Cover crops perform {{multiple}} {{functions in}} agro-ecosystems, such as nitrogen (N) fixation, nutrient retention and weed suppression. However, {{there is often a}} trade-off between N fixation and weed suppression - legumes fix N but are not very weed suppressive, while non-legumes suppress weeds but do not fix N. Legume-based mixtures, consisting of species with spatially and/or temporally complementary traits, can be a strategy to effectively manage N fixation and weed suppression. The aim of this study was to: (1) evaluate the N fixation and weed suppression characteristics of eight legume and four non-legume, annual summer species {{that can be used in}} the Northeastern U. S. A, (2) evaluate the performance of legume-based mixtures, in terms of biomass production, N fixation and weed suppression, (3) evaluate the competitive ability of the different legume and non-legume species in mixtures by using a replacement series design and (4) evaluate different management strategies to effectively manage mixtures for N fixation and weed suppression. Experiments were conducted over two years, and mixtures were designed using a replacement series. In monoculture, Crimson Clover fixed the most N (111 kgN. Ha- 1 in 2008 and 71 kgN. Ha 1 in 2009) and it was the most weed suppressive legume (12 g. m- 2 in 2008 and 20 g. m- 2 in 2009). Cowpea fixed the lowest amount of N in both years (12 kg N. Ha- 1 in 2008 and 13 kg N. Ha- 1 in 2009), but accessed more soil N (50 kg N. Ha- 1 in 2008 and 58 kg N. Ha- 1) than any of the legumes and it was the least weed suppressive legume in 2009 (250 g. m- 2 in 2009). Regarding the non-legumes, Sorghum Sudan (938 g. m- 2 and 632 g. m- 2) had the greatest biomass production in monoculture at high and low seeding densities (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 0001), while Buckwheat was the most weed suppressive (15 and 30 g. m- 2) species in monoculture (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 0001). Buckwheat took up similar amounts of soil N than Sorghum Sudan, even though it had lower above ground biomass. In all the mixtures, except Buckwheat, the LER was generally greater than one. The legumes in all the mixtures, except in the Buckwheat mixture, relied slightly more on N fixation than in monoculture. For non-viny legumes, the total N fixed was significantly greater in monocultures than in all the mixtures (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 05). For the viny legumes, total N fixed in mixtures with C- 4 grass species was not significantly different from the monocultures, but in Buckwheat mixtures significantly less N than monoculture was fixed (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 05). The weed suppressive capacity of the mixtures depended on the species involved, and there was no consistent improvement in mixture weed suppression compared to the monocultures (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 05). The competitive ability of the non-legumes can be ranked as follows: Buckwheat to Sorghum Sudan to <b>Japanese</b> <b>Millet</b> to Flax. Within non-viny legumes, the Berseem Clover was more competitive than Crimson Clover, and within the viny species Cowpea was more competitive than Soybean Tyrone and Chickling Vetch. There was a functional trade-off between N fixation and weed suppression: mixtures that are effective at suppressing weeds (Buckwheat mixtures) also suppress legumes and legumes that are competitive (Cowpea) in mixture do not fix a lot of nitrogen. In mixtures containing species with complementary growth times (Clovers and Sorghum Sudan / Buckwheat), mowing the competitive non-legumes increased legume biomass five-fold in Buckwheat mixtures and two-fold in Sorghum Sudan mixtures, while weed suppression was maintained. Nitrogen fixation increased eight- to ten-fold in mowed Buckwheat mixtures and two-to four-fold in mowed Sorghum Sudan mixtures. Mowing competitive species in temporally complementary mixtures can avoid the trade-offs in N fixation and weed suppression...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. August 2016. Major: Animal Sciences. Advisors: Marcia Hathway, Krishona Martinson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 116 pages. Warm-season grasses {{have the potential}} to provide forage in Upper Midwest pastures. The objectives of this research were to determine yield, forage nutritive value and preference of annual warm-season grasses under horse grazing. Four adult horses (Equus caballus) grazed <b>Japanese</b> <b>millet</b> (Echinochloa esculenta (A. Braun) H. Sholz) Siberian millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.), teff (Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter) sorghum sudan BMR (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), sudangrass (Sorghum sudanense (Piper) Stapf.), and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) at mature and vegetative stages. Forages were seeded in two separate plots utilizing a randomized complete block design with three replicates per plot. Each plot was grazed at a distinct target maturity and each maturity was grazed a minimum of three times each grazing season over a two-year period. Sudangrass was consistently the highest yielding grass (P ≤ 0. 0002), producing ≥ 5. 5 MT ha- 1 at the vegetative stage and ≥ 9. 7 MT ha- 1 at the mature stage while Japanese and Siberian millet exhibit the lowest yields at ≤ 5. 5 MT ha- 1 at the vegetative stage and ≤ 6. 3 MT ha- 1 at the mature stage. Annual ryegrass was the most preferred grass (P ≤ 0. 0057) with ≥ 60 % removal at the vegetative stage and ≥ 40 % removal at the mature stage. Siberian millet was the least preferred grass with ≤ 40 % removal at the vegetative stage and ≤ 5 % removal at the mature stage. While warm-season grasses meet the nutritional requirements of many classes of horses, Ca:P under 1 : 1 was observed as well as high NO 3 -N levels. These conditions could lead to limited mineral availability and possible nitrate toxicity. While teff and sudangrass have potential to be grazed by horses, Ca:P and NO 3 -N levels should be determined before grazing. Limited research is available regarding the role of leucine in regulating equine skeletal muscle protein synthesis. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of leucine on protein synthesis in cultured equine satellite cells by evaluating translation initiation factors in a western blot, the incorporation of puromycin using a nonradioactive surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) method, and measuring the incorporation of [3 H]Phenylalanine (3 HPhe) in a protein synthesis assay. Satellite cells from equine semimembranosus muscle were grown in cell culture until they developed into myotubes. Treatments used in the western blot consisted of a no leucine control (CON), leucine (LEU), control plus rapamycin (CR), and leucine plus rapamycin (LR). LEU exhibited higher 4 E-BP 1 and rpS 6 phosphorylation when compared to CON with no change observed in mTOR phosphorylation. No increase in phosphorylation was observed in CR or LR treatments. Puromycin incorporation was measured on treatments including a no puromycin control, a no leucine control (CON), and a leucine treatment (LEU). These results showed a 1. 6 -fold increase in puromycin incorporation between CON and LEU (P = 0. 0004). Treatments used in the protein synthesis assay consisted of a leucine titration ranging from 0 -nm to 408 -nm. These results showed muscle protein synthesis rates increased as a result of leucine treatments with significant differences observed at 204 -nM and 408 -nM leucine compared to the untreated cells. These treatments exhibited a 1. 6 -fold increase in protein synthesis rates when compared to the untreated control (P ≤ 0. 02). This study demonstrated the phosphorylation of translation initiation factors downstream of mTOR as well as increased 3 HPhe and puromycin with leucine treatment. These results suggest leucine can trigger muscle protein synthesis in horses through activation of the mTOR pathway...|$|E
