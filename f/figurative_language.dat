The main focus was to discover how <b>figurative</b> <b>languages</b> could be transferred from source text into target text. Four humorous Christian short stories were given to ten M. A.

To this end, through Newmark's faithful, cognitive, and adaptation methods, translated texts were scrutinized. Due to the religious and social differences between English and Persian cultures, the researcher concludes that the transference of <b>figurative</b> <b>languages</b> and humor from English into Persian could not take place thoroughly...|$|R

500|$|Asturias employs <b>figurative</b> <b>language</b> to {{describe}} dream imagery and the irrational. Literary critic Hughes Davies {{points out that}} Asturias frequently appeals to the reader's auditory senses. Asturias's often incantatory style employs [...] "unadulterated poetry to reinforce his imagery through sound". This helps readers to understand the physical {{as well as the}} psychological aspects of the novel. According to Knightly, [...] "few of Asturias's characters have much psychological depth; their inner conflicts tend to be externalized and played out at the archetypal level". More significantly, Asturias was the first Latin American novelist to combine stream of consciousness writing and <b>figurative</b> <b>language.</b> Hughes Davies argues that from the outset of , the gap between words and reality is exemplified through onomatopoeia, simile and repetition of phrases. Knightly notes that [...] "animistic elements surface occasionally in the characters' stream of consciousness". For example, in the chapter [...] "Tohil's Dance", Tohil, the God of Rain in Maya mythology, is imagined by Angel Face as arriving [...] "riding on a river of pigeons' breasts which flowed like milk". In Angel Face's vision, Tohil demands a human sacrifice and is content only so long as he [...] "can prevail over men who are hunters of men". Tohil pronounces: [...] "Henceforth there will be neither true death nor true life. Now dance." [...] As Knightly explains, this scene follows the President's orders for Miguel Angel Face to go on a mission that ends in his death, and is [...] "a sign of the President's evil nature and purposes". Davies contends that these literary techniques, when [...] "combined together with a discontinuous structure, give the text its surrealistic and nightmarish atmosphere".|$|E

500|$|Asturias blurs the {{separation}} {{between dream and reality}} throughout , {{making it one of the}} novel's most prominent themes. Latin American writer and critic Ariel Dorfman notes that the mixing of dream and reality is partly a result of Asturias's frequent use of <b>figurative</b> <b>language.</b> This stylistic choice is reflected in the content of the story itself, which suggests that an important effect of dictatorial power is the blurring of dreams and reality. Dorfman also notes that the President is sustained by fear, which further blurs the distinction between reality and dream. This fear grants him the voluntary or involuntary support of others, enabling the President to exercise his mandates. Dorfman asserts that the President's use of fear elevates his mandates to legends. These legends are then able to [...] "impose itself upon reality because men live it fully in a way to make sense of their humanity". One example of this theme, elucidated by Eckart, is a series of scenes leading to the arrest of the lawyer Carvajal. When the President decides to blame Carvajal for the murder of Colonel Sonriente, it is clear that Carvajal is confounded by the charges. Moreover, despite being a lawyer, Carvajal is unable to defend himself during the sham trial with [...] "the members of the tribunal so drunk that they cannot hear him". As Eckart asserts, [...] "to be captured and tortured without ever knowing why is another horrible feature of a dictatorship. For the victim, reality unexpectedly becomes unreality, no longer comprehensible by a logical mind." [...] Therefore, the use of fear by a dictatorship blurs the line between reality and dream for the people being ruled.|$|E

Other problems come from the translation document (e. g. an English novel translated into Bahasa Indonesia) and readers of the translated novel.

He wrote that Quintilian, while little-read in Mill's day due to [...] "his obscure style and to the scholastic details of which many parts of his treatise are made up," [...] was [...] "seldom sufficiently appreciated." [...] "His book," [...] Mill continued, [...] "is a kind of encyclopaedia of the thoughts of the ancients on the whole field of education and culture; and I have retained through life many valuable ideas which I can distinctly trace to my reading of him..."

In reality, for a triumph over the difficulties of the subject, and as a lesson {{on the possibility of}} imparting grace to the treatment of scholastic topics, naturally as intractable as that of Grammar or Prosody, there is no such chef-d'oeuvre to this hour in any literature, as the Institutions of Quintilian" [...] In more recent times, Quintilian appears to have made another upward turn. He is frequently included in anthologies of literary criticism, and {{is an integral part of}} the history of education. He is believed to be the “earliest spokesman for a child-centered education” (141), which is discussed above under his early childhood education theories.
