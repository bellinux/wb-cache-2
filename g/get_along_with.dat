5|$|Known {{as someone}} who was {{difficult}} to <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with,</b> he was not well liked by his fellow players. He never smoked, drank, or went to the movies, but frequently gambled on horse races during his career.|$|E
5|$|A {{mostly white}} breed {{with either a}} smooth, rough or broken coat, it {{conforms}} to a narrower range of sizes than the Jack Russell. It is a feisty, energetic terrier, suited to sports and able to <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> children and other animals. It has a range of breed-related health issues, mainly relating to eye disorders.|$|E
5|$|They can be playful {{with other}} dogs, and <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> horses. The breed {{standard}} requires that shyness {{be treated as}} a fault, although it states that this {{should not be confused with}} submissiveness which is not treated as such. Overt aggression towards another dog is not accepted and is a criterion for disqualification in the show ring.|$|E

5|$|With a good {{level of}} {{socialisation}} {{at an early}} age, an American Cocker can <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> people, children, other dogs and other pets. This breed {{seems to have a}} perpetually wagging tail and prefers to be around people; it is not best suited to the backyard alone. Cockers can be easily stressed by loud noises and by rough treatment or handling.|$|E
5|$|Although {{happy in}} the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. They can be stubborn, vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality. While they make for loyal family companions, they can be trained to be working dogs, making them {{excellent}} mousers or ratters. They can also be taught as a puppy to <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> other animals, including cats and birds.|$|E
5|$|Discontent {{against the}} king grew, however, and {{eventually}} affected also Edmund. The antagonism was largely caused by Edward's preference {{for his new}} favourites, Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father. In 1326, Edmund joined a rebellion led by Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer, whereby Edward II was deposed. Edmund failed to <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the new administration, and in 1330 he was caught planning a new rebellion, and executed.|$|E
50|$|Jughead's {{other friends}} include Dilton Doiley and Moose Mason. Other than Dilton, Jughead {{probably}} <b>gets</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> Moose {{better than the}} other boys because of his non-confrontational attitude (and his lack of interest in Moose's girlfriend Midge). Jughead’s nerdy ways and lack of interest in sports and girls probably account for how well he <b>gets</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> Dilton.|$|R

5|$|Josquin {{probably}} {{remained in}} the service of Louis XII until 1503, when Duke Ercole I of Ferrara hired him for the chapel there. One of the rare mentions of Josquin's personality survives from this time. Prior to hiring Josquin, one of Duke Ercole's assistants recommended that he hire Heinrich Isaac instead, since Isaac was easier to <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with,</b> more companionable, was more willing to compose on demand, and would cost significantly less (120 ducats vs. 200). Ercole, however, chose Josquin.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly {{played no}} Shield cricket the {{following}} season, {{when he was}} selected for the Australian tour to South Africa. Although Bradman had been vice-captain under Woodfull in 1934, he did not travel to South Africa on grounds of ill health, but played a full domestic season despite this. The team was captained by Victor Richardson, and O'Reilly publicly described it as the happiest tour he had been on—he {{was one of several}} players who did not <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> Bradman.|$|E
5|$|On stage, Evans was {{occasionally}} {{replaced by}} the band's first manager, Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with Sherbet prior to Daryl Braithwaite. Evans did not <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> Laughlin, which {{also contributed to the}} band's ill feeling toward Evans. By the middle of 1974, the band had built up a strong live reputation which led to a support slot for the visiting Lou Reed.|$|E

5|$|Corzine also chaired {{a presidential}} {{commission}} on capital budgeting for Bill Clinton {{and served as}} Chairman of the U.S. Treasury Department's borrowing committee. As the Goldman Sachs senior partner, he helped develop a private sector plan to rescue the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management when the leveraged fund's collapse {{in the fall of}} 1998 threatened contagion across the U.S. financial system. According to U.S. News & World Report, Corzine did not <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> co-CEO Henry Paulson, who came from the other major area of the bank, investment banking. When Corzine participated in structuring the bailout, Paulson seized control of the firm. As co-chairman of the firm, he oversaw its expansion into Asia. When Goldman Sachs went public after Corzine's departure, Corzine made $400million.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{was married}} twice, divorcing {{his first wife}} in acrimonious circumstances, and had a {{reputation}} for infidelity. His relationships with other players were difficult; team-mates and opponents alike found him hard to <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with.</b> He was unsuccessful in business dealings and failed to establish a successful career once he retired from cricket. He moved to South Africa in the 1950s in an attempt to start a business, but this came to nothing. As a result, he and his family struggled financially. Shortly after beginning a career as a sports administrator, he was involved in a serious car crash in 1960 which left him frail. He {{died of a heart attack}} in 1965.|$|E
5|$|He {{revealed}} in his 1996 autobiography {{that he had}} a strained relationship with his brother Bobby. Though the pair had different personalities, Jack felt that Bobby began to drift away from the Charlton family following his marriage to Norma, who did not <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> their mother. Bobby did not see his mother after 1992 until her death on 25 March 1996 {{as a result of the}} feud, though he and Norma did attend her funeral. Though the two brothers remained distant, Jack presented Bobby with his BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award on 14 December 2008.|$|E

5|$|In July 1984, he {{was signed}} by Mick Buxton at Second Division Huddersfield Town. The move reunited him with Paul Jones, his former centre-half partner at Bolton. Huddersfield {{finished}} in 13th place in the 1984–85 season, {{and at the end}} of the campaign accepted an offer of £15,000 from Bolton Wanderers, who offered Allardyce a three-year contract. Bolton were then managed by Charlie Wright, who was the goalkeeper at Allardyce's first spell with the club. However Wright was sacked in December 1985, and his successor, Phil Neal, did not <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> Allardyce. Neal played himself at centre-half and relegated Allardyce to the bench, despite Neal being a full-back. Bolton reached the 1986 Football League Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium, which ended in a 3–0 defeat to Bristol City, with Allardyce as an unused substitute.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur did not <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> Carpender, {{and twice}} asked {{for him to}} be {{replaced}}, only to be embarrassed in November 1943 when King replaced Carpender with Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid without informing MacArthur or seeking the approval of the Australian government. However, a face-saving formula was agreed upon. For the invasion of Leyte, the Seventh Fleet was massively reinforced by ships from the Pacific Fleet. Cover was provided by Admiral William F. Halsey's Third Fleet, which remained under Nimitz. At the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the divided command brought the Allies to the brink of disaster when misunderstandings arose between Kinkaid and Halsey. Allied Naval Forces was abolished, along with SWPA, on 2 September 1945.|$|E
5|$|Montcalm and Vaudreuil, {{who did not}} <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> each other, {{differed}} on how to {{deal with}} the British threat. They had fewer than 5,000 regular troops, an estimated six thousand militia men, and a limited number of Indian allies, to bring against British forces reported to number 50,000. Vaudreuil, who had limited combat experience, wanted to divide the French forces, with about 5,000 each at Carillon and Louisbourg, and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the British in the Mohawk River on the northwestern frontiers of the Province of New York. Montcalm believed this to be folly, as the plan would enable the British to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the French attack. Vaudreuil prevailed, and in June 1758 Montcalm left Quebec for Carillon.|$|E

It is an active breed that enjoys tracking foxes and has the stamina to run all day with few breaks.|$|R
5|$|The {{expansion}} of the telegraph {{and the development of}} the telephone gave McKinley a greater control over the day-to-day management of the war than previous presidents had enjoyed, and he used the new technologies to direct the army's and navy's movements {{as far as he was}} able. McKinley found Alger inadequate as Secretary of War, and did not <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the Army's commanding general, Nelson A. Miles. Bypassing them, he looked for strategic advice first from Miles's predecessor, General John Schofield, and later from Adjutant General Henry Clarke Corbin. The war led to a change in McKinley's cabinet, as the President accepted Sherman's resignation as Secretary of State; Day agreed to serve as Secretary until the war's end.|$|E
5|$|A {{short while}} {{later at the}} Andronikov Monastery, a {{messenger}} arrives from Moscow to ask Andrei for his assistance in decorating the Annunciation Cathedral with Theophanes the Greek. Both Daniil and Kirill are agitated by the recognition that Andrei receives. Daniil refuses to accompany Andrei and reproaches him for accepting Theophanes’ offer without considering his fellows, but soon repents of his temper and tearfully wishes Andrei well when the younger monk comes {{to say goodbye to}} his friend. Kirill is jealous of Andrei and in a fit of anger, decides to leave the monastery for the secular world, throwing accusations of greed in the face of his fellow monks, who also dismiss him. Kirill stumbles out of the monastery into the snowy countryside and is pursued by his dog, but Kirill savagely beats it with his walking stick and leaves it for dead. Andrei leaves for Moscow with his young apprentice Foma (Mikhail Kononov). Foma is another creative character, representing the light-hearted and practical-minded commercial artist. Still he seems to be contemplative enough to <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> Andrei.|$|E
5|$|After 103 {{appearances}} for Third Division Gillingham {{he moved}} on to top-flight Coventry City in 1983 for a fee approaching £85,000. He struggled with injury during his time at Highfield Road, and was never popular with the fans. Keith Houchen also recalled that he did not <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> manager John Sillett and was prone to sulking when left out of the team. Despite this he managed to play over 100 games for City over a four-year period before Leeds United manager Billy Bremner took him to the Second Division for a £110,000 fee. Near the end of his first season at Leeds he played in the club's FA Cup Semi-final defeat to former club Coventry at Hillsborough, as Coventry won 3–2 in extra time. Leeds suffered further heartbreak in 1987 by losing the play-off Final to Charlton Athletic, again after extra time.|$|E
