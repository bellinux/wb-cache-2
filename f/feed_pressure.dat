2500|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered with the Mark I Cell was that its performance was reduced if the feed rate to the cell varied, which was a common occurrence arising from normal fluctuations in operating concentrators. This problem was resolved by recycling some of the tailings to the cell feed via an external splitter box called an [...] "External Recycle Mechanism" [...] or [...] "ERM" [...] box separate to the flotation cell. Thus, when {{the production of the}} feed stream to the Jameson Cell decreased {{as a result of a}} fluctuation elsewhere in the concentrator, a higher percentage of the tailings was automatically recycled to the downcomers, producing a constant flow rate, hence <b>feed</b> <b>pressure,</b> to the cell. This had the added benefit of giving a proportion of the tailings (typically 40%) a second pass through the system, which resulted in higher recoveries. In coal fines flotation, this allowed a single Cell to achieve the same recovery of combustibles as had previously been achieved in some two-stage Cell systems.|$|E

40|$|Summary: About 30 {{female and}} {{juvenile}} Himalayan thar (Hemitragus jemlahicus) were observed over 2 {{years on a}} 200 ha study area. At dawn, thar were at low altitudes and most were feeding. They ascended during the morning to spend {{the middle of the}} day resting at high altitudes. In the afternoon they descended again, with increasing feeding activity, to reach low altitudes at dusk. The vertical movement was 450 m in summer and 150 m in winter. The proportion of the day spent feeding was highest in November-February and lowest in August-September. Resting behaviour was more frequent in March-May and August-October than at other times. The proportion of the day spent standing increased threefold during June-July. The <b>feeding</b> <b>pressure</b> during daylight on four vegetation associations showed that tall snow tussock grasslands at high altitudes were likely to be the most susceptible to modification.

40|$|A simple {{model of}} the {{transfer}} of charge and ion evaporation in the meniscus of an ionic-liquid ion source working in the purely ionic regime is proposed {{on the basis of}} order-of-magnitude estimates which show that, in this regime, _i_ the flow in the meniscus is dominated by the viscosity of the liquid and is affected very little by the mass flux accompanying ion evaporation, and _ii_ the effect of the space charge around the evaporating surface is negligible and the evaporation current is controlled by the finite electrical conductivity of the liquid. The model predicts that a stationary meniscus of a very polar liquid undergoing ion evaporation is nearly hydrostatic and can exist only below a certain value of the applied electric field, at which the meniscus attains its maximum elongation but stays smooth. The electric current vs applied electric field characteristic displays a frozen regime of negligible ion evaporation at low fields and a conduction-controlled regime at higher fields, with a sharp transition between the two regimes owing to the high sensitivity of the ion evaporation rate to the electric field. A simplified treatment of the flow in the capillary or liquid layer through which liquid is delivered to the meniscus shows that the size of the meniscus decreases and the maximum attainable current increases when the <b>feeding</b> <b>pressure</b> is decreased, and that appropriate combinations of <b>feeding</b> <b>pressure</b> and pressure drop may lead to high maximum currents...|$|R

50|$|The {{feed gas}} (consisting {{of at least}} two components) first enters a section with an {{arrangement}} of static blades or wings, which induce a fast swirl in the gas.Thereafter the gas stream flows through a Laval nozzle, where it accelerates to supersonic speeds and undergoes a deep pressure drop to about 30% of <b>feed</b> <b>pressure.</b> This is a near isentropic process and the corresponding temperature reduction leads to condensation of target components of the mixed feed gas, which form a fine mist. The droplets agglomerate to larger drops, and the swirl of the gas causes cyclonic separation.The dry gas continues forward, while the liquid phase together with some slip gas (about 30% of the total stream) is separated by a concentric divider and exits the device as a separate stream.

40|$|Despite {{intrinsically}} high separation performance, conventional polymeric membranes {{suffer from}} CO₂ induced plasticization, which reduces CO₂/CH₄ separation efficiency significantly. Covalent ester-crosslinking {{can improve the}} plasticization resistance by controlling the segmental chain mobility in the polymer; however, only relatively thick selective skin layers and lower separation productivity {{have been reported to}} date. On the other hand, the high cost of crosslinkable polymers makes the approach challenging, especially for large-scale gas separations which require large membrane areas with high <b>feed</b> <b>pressures.</b> Dual-layer hollow fiber spinning can be used to reduce the cost of membrane production by integrating a low-cost supporting core polymer with the expensive crosslinkable sheath polymer. However, the complexity of interfacial interaction between the sheath/core layers and subsequent crosslinking required can delaminate the sheath/core layers and collapse the core layer polymer. This can reduce mechanical strength and the separation productivity significantly. This work aimed to develop thin-skinned high-performing ester-crosslinked hollow fiber membranes with improved CO₂ plasticization resistance. The skin layer thickness of hollow fibers was first optimized by simultaneous optimization of the polymer dope and spinning process variables. Moreover, this study also addresses the solutions of challenging in transitioning the monolithic hollow fiber to composite hollow fiber format. The ester-crosslinked hollow fibers were subjected to high <b>feed</b> <b>pressures</b> and high-level contaminants to probe their CO₂ plasticization and hydrocarbon antiplasticization resistance, respectively. The resultant ester-crosslinked monolithic hollow fibers show significantly reduced skin layer thickness and improved separation productivity under extremely challenging operation conditions. They also demonstrate strong stability under high <b>feed</b> <b>pressures</b> and reversibility after contaminant exposure. Moreover, this study presents a newly discovered core layer material, Torlon®, which demonstrates excellent compatibility with the crosslinkable polymer and superior thermal stability during crosslinking without sheath/core layer delamination or collapse. The characterization under aggressive feed conditions clearly suggests that ester-crosslinked composite hollow fibers can achieve high separation performance and reduce membrane cost simultaneously. This provides a significant advance in state of the art for natural gas separations under realistic operation environmentsPh. D...|$|R

The relative abundance and <b>feeding</b> <b>pressure</b> of corallivorous wrasses and butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae) in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, were compared. Overall, tubelip wrasses were {{more than twice as}} abundant as corallivorous butterflyfishes and accounted for three times as many feeding bites on corals. The three most abundant tubelip wrasses (yellowtail tubelip Diproctacanthus xanthurus, Allen's tubelip Labropsis alleni and the tubelip wrasse Labrichthys unilineatus) were all obligate corallivores taking > 97 % of bites from the surface of live corals. Labropsis alleni and D. xanthurus were highly selective, consuming preferred prey species in proportions significantly higher than expected given their availability. In contrast, L. unilineatus was fairly non-selective and consumed most corals in direct accordance with their availability. As coral predators, tubelip wrasses are highly comparable to coral-feeding butterflyfishes in the coral species consumed, range of dietary specialization and their reliance on live coral. Tubelip wrasses, however, may supersede butterflyfishes as the predominant corallivorous family in some Indo-Pacific locations, and coral-feeding tubelip wrasses are likely to be severely affected by coral decline...|$|R

40|$|The Southwestern Atlantic harbors {{unique and}} {{relatively}} understudied reef systems, including the only atoll in South Atlantic: Rocas atoll. Located 230 km off the NE Brazilian coast, Rocas is formed by {{coralline red algae}} and vermetid mollusks, and is potentially {{one of the most}} "pristine" areas in Southwestern Atlantic. We provide the first comprehensive and integrative description of the fish and benthic communities inhabiting different shallow reef habitats of Rocas. We studied two contrasting tide pool habitats: open pools, which communicate with the open ocean even during low tides, thus more exposed to wave action; and closed pools, which remain isolated during low tide and are comparatively less exposed. Reef fish assemblages, benthic cover, algal turfs and fish <b>feeding</b> <b>pressure</b> on the benthos remarkably varied between open and closed pools. The planktivore Thalassoma noronhanum was the most abundant fish species in both habitats. In terms of biomass, the lemon shark Negaprion brevirostris and the omnivore Melichtys niger were dominant in open pools, while herbivorous fishes (mainly Acanthurus spp.) prevailed in closed pools. Overall benthic cover was dominated by algal turfs, composed of articulated calcareous algae in open pools and non-calcified algae in closed pools. <b>Feeding</b> <b>pressure</b> was dominated by acanthurids and was 10 -fold lower in open pools than in closed pools. Besides different wave exposure conditions, such pattern could also be related to the presence of sharks in open pools, prompting herbivorous fish to feed more in closed pools. This might indirectly affect the structure of reef fish assemblages and benthic communities. The macroalgae Digenea simplex, which is uncommon in closed pools and abundant in the reef flat, was highly preferred in herbivory assays, indicating that herbivory by fishes might be shaping this distribution pattern. The variations in benthic and reef fish communities, and <b>feeding</b> <b>pressure</b> on the benthos between open and closed pools suggest that the dynamics in open pools is mostly driven by physical factors and the tolerance of organisms to harsh conditions, while in closed pools direct and indirect effects of species interactions also play an important role.
