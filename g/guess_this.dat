500|$|The video {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "psychedelic" [...] and as an anthem to Marijuana, rather than one about drunkenness. Brad Wete for Entertainment Weekly explained that Mars was [...] "ready to drown his sorrows in a tall glass of alcohol" [...] and tipped [...] "find out what concoction Mars and Marley are whipping up" [...] by watching the clip. Prefix Magazine s Andrew Winistorfer gave the video a harsh critic, he wrote that the smoke was not the only featured in the video as anyone [...] "get to see Damian Marley sell out in real time". He furthered that Damian, [...] "might as well be in McDonald's commercials. I <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> song is supposed to make you THINK about stuff [...] but mostly it makes me try to find someone to blame for this".|$|E
500|$|... "Pathetic" [...] {{is a tale}} of [...] "abject self-pity in {{the face}} of {{collapsed}} relationship." [...] The distinctive riff of [...] "Dammit" [...] was created when Hoppus was forced to skip over the missing two strings on an acoustic guitar. The song's themes include maturity and the refrain, [...] "Well I <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> is growing up." [...] "Dick Lips" [...] was named after an insult bandied around at Big Fish during recording. It was written about DeLonge's experience when he was kicked out of Poway High School for showing up to a basketball game while intoxicated. [...] "Waggy" [...] was a word Hoppus created while belching, prompting him to name the song with it. [...] "Untitled" [...] is inspired by the emerging ska punk scene, and [...] "Emo" [...] by its namesake, which is partly a tribute to DeLonge's favorite band, Jimmy Eat World.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the less}} {{favorable}} contemporary critiques, a Melody Maker reviewer dismissed the album as [...] "Not typical Byrds music, which is rather a pity." [...] Writing in Crawdaddy! {{just before he}} withdrew from city life and temporarily retired from music journalism, Paul Williams lamented: [...] "I'm beginning to think I'll have to make this jailbreak unaided … The Byrds have gone country and Big Pink is out, and it's beautiful stuff, man, beautiful … But country is just more relaxation, wonderful stifling inertia … and I <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> isn't the summer to look to be rescued by music." [...] Robert Shelton of The New York Times similarly commented that [...] "The latest Byrds album adheres {{to most of the}} 'rules of the game' about country sound, and yet, sad to say, to this old fan of the Byrds, the album is a distinguished bore." ...|$|E
500|$|Greatest Hits {{opens with}} [...] "Carousel", {{which was the}} very first song Hoppus and DeLonge wrote {{together}} upon their meeting in August 1992. It {{has been described by}} journalist Joe Shooman as [...] "a satisfyingly fast-assed punk song in the vein of NOFX with some very adept dynamic breakdowns." [...] The band's first promotional single, [...] "M+M's", follows, which is based around power chords and Hoppus' lead vocal of a vacation elsewhere. [...] "Dammit", which was the band's first major-label single and also their first radio hit, is themed around maturity and the refrain, [...] "Well I <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> is growing up." [...] The distinctive riff of [...] "Dammit" [...] was created when Hoppus was forced to skip over the missing two strings on an acoustic guitar. It reached number 11 on Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1998, and received heavy radio airplay. [...] "Josie" [...] is about [...] "being stoked on a girl." [...] It contains references to the bands Unwritten Law and Dance Hall Crashers ("My girlfriend likes UL and DHC"), two groups the band toured with in the mid-1990s.|$|E

Question No.19 asked [...] "We were told Anarky would be playing a part in 52. Could you please tell us when we can expect his appearances?" [...] Siglain's simple response to readers was, [...] "check back in the late 40s." [...] Speculation centered on the prospect of Anarky appearing in issue No.48 of the series, as the solicited cover illustration was released to the public several weeks before the issues' publication. [...] On the cover, the circle-A could be seen as a minor element in the background. In a review for [...] "Week 48", Major Spoilers considered the absence of Anarky a drawback: [...] "It's too bad we didn't see the return of Anarky as hinted by this week's cover" [...] Pop culture critic, Douglas Wolk, wrote, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> issue's cover is the closest we're going to get to Anarky after all (and by proxy as close as we're {{going to get to the}} Haunted Tank).

500|$|The {{death toll}} {{could have been}} worse {{had it not been for}} the {{self-sacrifice}} of an Intercolonial Railway dispatcher, Patrick Vincent (Vince) Coleman, operating at the railyard about [...] from Pier 6, where the explosion occurred. He and his co-worker, William Lovett, learned of the dangerous cargo aboard the burning Mont-Blanc from a sailor and began to flee. Coleman remembered, however, that an incoming passenger train from Saint John, New Brunswick, was due to arrive at the railyard within minutes. He returned to his post alone and continued to send out urgent telegraph messages to stop the train. Several variations of the message have been reported, among them this from the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic: [...] "Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbor making for Pier 6 and will explode. <b>Guess</b> <b>this</b> will be my last message. Good-bye boys." [...] Coleman's message was responsible for bringing all incoming trains around Halifax to a halt. It was heard by other stations all along the Intercolonial Railway, helping railway officials to respond immediately. Passenger Train No. 10, the overnight train from Saint John, is believed to have heeded the warning and stopped a safe distance from the blast at Rockingham, saving the lives of about 300 railway passengers. Coleman was killed at his post as the explosion ripped through the city. He was honoured with a Heritage Minute in the 1990s and inducted into the Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2004.|$|E
500|$|On the October 31, 2007 {{episode of}} the reality show Phenomenon, Paranormalist Jim Callahan {{performed}} a summoning, purportedly of author Raymond Hill, to help discover {{the contents of a}} locked box. [...] Although fellow judge Uri Geller praised the performance, Angel called it [...] "comical" [...] and subsequently challenged both Callahan and Geller to guess the contents of two envelopes he pulled out of his pocket, offering a million dollars of his own money to whoever could do so. This led to an argument between Callahan and Angel, during which Callahan walked toward Angel and called him an [...] "ideological bigot", with the two pulled apart as the show promptly went to a commercial break. Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, [...] "Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a lot of years between us - 40 years, you were one year old when I came out with my spoon bending..." [...] Criss Angel cut him off at this point, saying, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> is a 'no,'" [...] and proceeded to open the envelope. The envelope contained an index card with the numbers [...] "911" [...] printed on it for September 11, 2001. Angel's explanation was this: [...] "If on 9-10 somebody could have predicted that 9-11 was going to happen, they could have saved thousands of lives". The other envelope's contents were scheduled to be revealed on the first episode of Season 4 of Criss Angel: Mindfreak.|$|E
2500|$|On the album’s evolution, Rygg commented, [...] "I {{was pretty}} set on keeping it more bare this time. When we did Blood Inside, we'd been holding {{back with all}} that minimal stuff for so long — the soundtracks (Lyckantropen Themes and Svidd neger), the Silence EPs and all that. So Blood Inside was an {{outburst}} of sorts. I <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> record is a withdrawal again, so that's an inherent dynamic...flux and reflux." ...|$|E

2500|$|Around 2004, after most {{computer}} software became compatible with Unicode UTF-8 or UTF-16 systems, use of Greeklish was strongly discouraged in many Greek online Web discussion boards (forums) where Greeklish was in use before.

Examples include the , the [...] , the [...] , the , the [...] forum, the [...] and the [...] Greek student forum. The {{reason for this is}} the fact that text written in Greeklish is considerably less aesthetically pleasing, and also much harder to read, compared to text written in the Greek alphabet. A non-Greek speaker/reader can <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> by this example: [...] "δις ιζ χαρντ του ριντ" [...] would be the way to write [...] "this is hard to read" [...] in English but utilizing the Greek alphabet.|$|E
2500|$|Sherlock {{recorded}} {{an album}} between July 11–15, 1994. He played, produced, and mixed everything himself. A person under the pseudonym [...] "Unblack Mark" [...] handled {{the studio and}} recording techniques. As a graphic artist himself, Sherlock created the album's packaging and cover picture. Sherlock marked himself under the pseudonym [...] "Anonymous" [...] in the album's booklet since neither he nor the record company were supposed to reveal his identity. The album was named Hellig Usvart, which is Norwegian for [...] "holy unblack". Sherlock {{said in an interview}} about the name: [...] "I read on the back of an early Dark Throne album, 'Dark Throne play Unholy Black Metal'. Horde was always going to be lyrically the opposite of this, hence: 'Holy Unblack Metal'. I <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> is how the 'unblack' name or title came about.

All guitars and bass for the album were completed by early July, and, {{by the end of}} the month, Urie confirmed that recording of the album was complete and mixing would follow soon. Near the end of the writing process, the band looked back upon the lyrics and noticed that [...] "some of the motion was pining for something, or some of it was vanity, or some of it touched on subversion or overthrowing of somebody or manipulation." [...] Urie likened it to the seven deadly sins, and, after research, settled on the title Vices & Virtues. [...] "In the Biblical sense, there's all that stuff and then there’s just morals that we live by every day and human behavior", Urie said.

Little Red Ridinghood meets a hungry Wolf who convinces her to take a detour on her way to Granny's ("Hello, Little Girl"). The Baker sees Little Red Ridinghood in the woods, and when the Witch appears, screaming at him to get the red cape, he is so frightened that he forgets the ingredients he needs. Luckily his wife, who followed him into the forest, reminds him. They are squabbling over her presence when they come across Jack with Milky White. Not having the money necessary to buy the cow, they convince Jack that the beans the Baker has found in his father's old hunting jacket are magic beans and buy the cow for five of them. Jack bids a tearful goodbye to his cow ("I <b>Guess</b> <b>This</b> Is Goodbye"), and the Baker orders his wife to return to the village with the cow. He has qualms about being so dishonest, but his wife reasons that the chance to have a child justifies their trickery ("Maybe They're Magic").|$|E
