Specifically, while Blow took the unique narrative model of Invisible Cities, {{he did not like}} the homage to it in Einstein's Dreams, and thus avoided taking the story in that direction. Blow's goal was that Braid would [...] "be mind-expanding" [...] and that [...] "people [...] get experiences from it that they [...] not <b>gotten</b> <b>from</b> anything else". Blow opted to present his story through on-screen text instead of in-game cutscenes, asserting, against criticism of the lack of such cut-scenes, that Braid was [...] "conceived as a videogame with its story presented in the tradition of a few books that I respect".|$|E

500|$|In 1862 Whistler {{had met the}} English poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, {{with whom}} he {{developed}} a close friendship. The {{relationship between the two}} was mutually beneficial. Inspired by Whistler's Little White Girl, Swinburne wrote a poem with the title [...] "Before the Mirror". Before the painting went on exhibition at the Royal Academy, Whistler pasted the poem written on gold leaf onto the frame. The idea of decorating a painting's frame with a poem was one Whistler had <b>gotten</b> <b>from</b> Rossetti, who had similarly pasted a golden paper with one of his poems on the frame of his 1849 painting The Girlhood of Mary. To Whistler, this poem underlined his idea of the autonomous nature of the painted medium. It showed that painters were more than mere illustrators, and that visual art could be an inspiration for poetry, not just the other way around.|$|E
500|$|Collins then {{burst into}} tears and exclaimed {{that the only thing}} she had ever <b>gotten</b> <b>from</b> the store without paying was her free lunch. [...] This {{prompted}} renewed questioning from the investigator and manager because of the differing policies regarding free lunches at lobby food operations (not allowed) versus stores with lunch counters (allowed). Collins again requested and was refused the presence of a union representative. Based on the questioning, the investigator prepared a statement that Collins owed $160 for lunches but she refused to sign the statement. It was later found that most (if not all) of the employees at Store No. 98 (including the manager) took free lunches because they had never been informed of the policy prohibiting it. When the investigator contacted company headquarters during the interview, the company itself was uncertain whether the policy against free lunches was even in effect at that store.|$|E

According to Carter, [...] "the {{idea that there is}} something approaching at the millennium, this series being produced I think four years {{before the end of the}} century, that we were headed toward something grave and foreboding". The name of recurring character Bob Bletcher came from an attorney Carter had worked with previously.

500|$|Hitoshi Sakimoto {{composed}} {{most of the}} game's soundtrack; Nobuo Uematsu, {{following his}} departure from Square Enix in 2004, only contributed the theme song, [...] "Kiss Me Good-Bye", sung by Angela Aki. Uematsu noted that Aki's style of playing the keyboard while singing {{reminded him of his}} childhood idol, Elton John, {{which was one of the}} reasons he chose her. Aki was approached for the role three years before the release of the game. She based her words for the song on [...] "a scene of a new journey after good-bye", which was the sense she had <b>gotten</b> <b>from</b> Uematsu's melody, and was encouraged by Uematsu not to limit herself in her lyrics to what she thought the producers wanted. Sakimoto was brought in to compose the soundtrack to the game by Yasumi Matsuno, the producer of the game, five months before the game was officially announced. Sakimoto experienced difficulty following in Uematsu's footsteps, but he decided to create a unique soundtrack in his own way, although he cites Uematsu as his biggest musical influence.|$|E
