40|$|Studies {{of forest}} declines are important, because they both reduce timber {{production}} and affect successional trajectories of landscapes and ecosystems. Of particular {{interest is the}} decline of red pines which is characterized by expanding areas of dead and chlorotic trees in plantations throughout the Great Lakes Region. Here we {{examine the impact of}} two bark beetle groups, namely red turpentine beetles and <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> bark beetles, on tree mortality and the subsequent gap formation over time in a plantation in Wisconsin. We construct spatial-temporal statistical models that quantify the relations among red turpentine beetle colonization, <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> bark beetle colonization, and mortality of red pine trees, while accounting for correlation across space and over time. For statistical inference, we adopt a Bayesian hierarchical model and devise Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for obtaining the posterior distributions of model parameters as well as posterior predictive distributions. Our data analysis results suggest that red turpentine beetle colonization is associated with higher likelihood of <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> bark beetle colonization and <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> bark beetle colonization is associated with higher likelihood of red pine tree mortality, whereas there is no direct association between red turpentine beetle colonization and red pine tree mortality. There is strong evidence that red turpentine beetle colonization does not kill a red pine tree directly, but rather predisposes the tree to subsequent colonization by <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> bark beetles. The evidence is also strong that <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> bark beetles are the ultimate mortality agents of red pine trees...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{observed}} effects of various slash treatments on <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> colonization. Five slash treatments (slash-free, chipped, small piles, large piles, scattered) were replicated five times {{at each of}} two sites, one consisting mainly of ponderosa pine and the other predominantly lodgepole pine. No pine engravers were found in slash-free or chipped slash treatments at either site. At the ponderosa pine site, significantly more <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> attacks and galleries {{were found in the}} scattered slash treatment than in small and large pile treatments. A significantly greater number of invertebrate natural enemies were also found in the scattered slash treatment, where they were approximately six to nine times as abundant as in the small pile and large pile treatments, respectively. No pine engravers were observed colonizing slash in the lodgepole pine treatments where slash was in an advanced stage of drying. At both sites, the use of a feller buncher-delimber during harvest increased the rate of drying of slash, reducing its suitability for <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> colonization...|$|R

40|$|The {{nucleotide}} diversities {{and genetic}} {{relationship in the}} three <b>Japanese</b> <b>pine</b> species, P. thunbergii, P. densiflora, and P. luchuensis, were measured using low-copy anchor loci in Pinaceae. The average nucleotide diversity among these three <b>Japanese</b> <b>pines</b> revealed that P. thunbergii was the highest (6. 05 × 10 − 3), followed by P. densiflora (5. 27 × 10 − 3) and P. luchuensis (5. 02 × 10 − 3). In comparison to other conifer species, {{it was concluded that}} the pines possessed an intermediate level of nucleotide diversity. The Heat shock protein (HSP) gene in P. thunbergii, Phenylalanine tRNA synthetase, RuBP carboxylase, and Disease resistance response protein 206 genes in P. densiflora were significantly deviated from standard neutral models. Some of these genes were related to stress or pathogen/defense response. As the samples used in this study were collected from natural populations that showed specific characteristics of being resistant to pine wilt nematode, it was hypothesized that the initial selection was an important factor in discriminating the deviation from neutrality models. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that the three <b>Japanese</b> <b>pines</b> were split into two lineages corresponding to P. densiflora and P.  thunbergii–P. luchuensis. The latter lineage was differentiated further into two clades; P. thunbergii and P. luchuensis.

40|$|Pathogenicity of {{the pine}} wood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, to Japanese larch, Larix kaempferi, {{seedlings}} was tested with inoculation experiments under nursery conditions. Water suspensions of nematodes (mixed stages cultured on Botrytis cinerea or dispersal fourth-stage juveniles (DJ 4) extracted from the adult <b>Japanese</b> <b>pine</b> sawyer, Monochamus alternatus) were injected into the stems of 2 - and 3 -year-old Japanese larch and <b>Japanese</b> black <b>pine,</b> Pinus thunbergii, seedlings growing in a nursery.

40|$|Discerning {{linkages}} among trophic {{levels and}} untangling indirect interactions {{is essential to}} understanding structuring of communities and ecosystems. Indeed, indirect interactions among disparate taxa are often essential to the functional role of these species. The goal {{of this research was}} to test the hypothesis that the relationship between 2 dendrophagous taxa, the North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) and the <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> beetle (Ips hoppingi), is an asymmetric indirect interaction mediated by a common host. We proposed that damage by the porcupine predisposes the papershell pinyon pine (Pinus remota) to colonization by <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> beetles. We examined porcupine tree selection, pinyon pine physiology and physiognomy, and beetle-pine associations on a study area in the southwestern Edwards Plateau of Texas from June 1997 to August 1999. Although attacks by beetles were evident on both damaged and undamaged trees, successful colonization was greater on pines damaged by porcupines. Intensity of porcupine attack, indexed by number of feeding scars and area of bark removed, also was associated with subsequent colonization by beetles. Porcupines selected pinyon pines over more abundant species (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and were selective at the level of morphology, whereas <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> beetles were selective of tree morphology and physiology. Trees colonized by beetles had phloem with higher concentrations of fructose and glucose and lower percent composition of limonene, sabinene, and terpinolene than uncolonized trees. Our findings supported our hypothesis of an indirect interaction between these dendrophages. We rejected alternative explanations (e. g., that these dendrophages preferred similar trees or that beetles facilitated porcupine damage) for this relationship based on the biology of Ips and their selection of host trees. We propose that release of volatile terpenes as a result of porcupine feeding and reallocation of carbon resources as a response to stress explains the facilitation of beetle colonization in porcupine-damaged trees. Our findings parallel those observed in other systems involving indirect effects and fit within the framework of theories explaining host plant-herbivore interactions...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>engraver,</b> Ips pini (Say), {{often use}} {{thinning}} slash, and their populations {{are known to}} be influenced by the condition of this material. In our study, we evaluated the importance of three log diameters (5, 10, and 20 cm) and three lengths (60, 120, and 240 cm) on various parameters of bark beetle host attack, development, and emergence. Evaluation of slash colonization in northern Arizona (near Flagstaff) and western Montana (near Missoula) over several years, during both spring and summer reproductive periods, indicated that the size of material selected by <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> differed by state, year, and season. However, within individual trials and over all trials, a trend in preference for larger diameter logs was apparent, whereas log length was of little effect. When evaluating only attacked logs, results indicated that the apparent preference for larger logs was not followed by significantly greater reproductive performance in the larger log sizes. Log origin was tested as a potential factor for the difference in attack densities between Arizona and Montana trials. Although male beetles in Montana and female beetles in Arizona seemed to distinguish between local-source and foreign-source logs during the attack phase, the gallery development and reproductive success of egg, larval, and new adult stages were not significantly different. Ultimately, differences among the trials both in host size selection and in reproductive success within attacked logs were closely tied to the overall population density of adult beetles. The implications of these findings for resource managers are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Four {{treatments}} (control, burn-only, thin-only, and thin-and-burn) {{were evaluated}} for {{their effects on}} bark beetle-caused mortality in both the short-term (one to four years) and the long-term (seven years) in mixed-conifer forests in western Montana, USA. In addition to assessing bark beetle responses to these treatments, we also measured natural enemy landing rates and resin flow of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) the season fire treatments were implemented. All bark beetles were present at low population levels (non-outbreak) {{for the duration of}} the study. Post-treatment mortality of trees due to bark beetles was lowest in the thin-only and control units and highest in the units receiving burns. Three tree-killing bark beetle species responded positively to fire treatments: Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae), <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> (Ips pini), and western pine beetle (Dendroctonus brevicomis). Red turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus valens) responded positively to fire treatments, but never caused mortality. Three fire damage variables tested (height of crown scorch, percent circumference of the tree bole scorched, or degree of ground char) were significant factors in predicting beetle attack on trees. Douglas-fir beetle and <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> responded rapidly to increased availability of resources (fire-damaged trees); however, successful attacks dropped rapidly once these resources were depleted. Movement to green trees by <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> was not observed in plots receiving fire treatments, or in thinned plots where slash supported substantial reproduction by this beetle. The fourth tree-killing beetle present at the site, the mountain pine beetle, did not exhibit responses to any treatment. Natural enemies generally arrived at trees the same time as host bark beetles. However, the landing rates of only one, Medetera spp., was affected by treatment. This predator responded positively to thinning treatments. This insect was present in very high numbers indicating a regulatory effect on beetles, at least in the short-term, in thinned stands. Resin flow decreased from June to August. However, resin flow was significantly higher in trees in August than in June in fire treatments. Increased flow in burned trees later in the season did not affect beetle attack success. Overall, responses by beetles to treatments were short-term and limited to fire-damaged trees. Expansions into green trees did not occur. This lack of spread was likely due to a combination of high tree vigor in residual stands and low background populations of bark beetles...|$|R
