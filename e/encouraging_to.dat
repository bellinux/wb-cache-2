5|$|Britain's {{fears of}} war with Germany were {{realised}} in 1914 with {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany's overseas colonies in Africa. In the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied German New Guinea and Samoa respectively. Plans for a post-war division of the Ottoman Empire, which had joined the war on Germany's side, were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement. This agreement was not divulged to the Sharif of Mecca, who the British had been <b>encouraging</b> <b>to</b> launch an Arab revolt against their Ottoman rulers, giving the impression that Britain was supporting the creation of an independent Arab state.|$|E

25|$|The Admiralty {{were not}} {{initially}} <b>encouraging</b> <b>to</b> Hawker's approaches, {{in part due}} {{the presence of the}} in-development jet-powered Supermarine Attacker aircraft. However, the service was intrigued by the long-range capability of the P.1040, {{as well as by the}} promise of increased power from the Nene engine. Thus, in May 1946, the Naval Staff authorised the manufacture of three prototypes and a further test specimen, one of these being the original prototype internally ordered by Hawker, in accordance with Naval Specification N.7/46. Hawker quickly found their development focus for the type being divided between the navy's P.1046 and the general-purpose P.1040, which was still hoped to be viable as an RAF fighter. The P.1040 would lead to the eventual development of the land-based swept wing Hawker Hunter fighter. Swept wing versions (P.1052 and P.1081) were built and experience gained with these were instrumental in developing the design of the Hunter.|$|E

After {{the success of}} Dig Me Out and its predecessor Call the Doctor, several major record labels grew interested in the band and offered them recording contracts, but the band ultimately decided to remain on Kill Rock Stars. As singer and guitarist Corin Tucker recalls, [...] "We want to project the image that we're successful".

500|$|The Reverend John Wheelwright {{had arrived}} in the colony in May 1636, {{aligning}} himself with the free grace advocates who adhered to Cotton's doctrines, which included most {{of the members of the}} Boston Church. [...] The controversy became much more political when, in the same month, the young aristocrat, Henry Vane, was elected as the governor of the colony. [...] Vane was a free grace advocate and a strong supporter of Hutchinson, but also had his own unorthodox ideas about theology that were considered radical. [...] By late 1636 the theological schism had become great enough that the General Court called for a day of fasting to help ease the colony's difficulties. [...] Wheelwright had been invited as a guest preacher to the Boston church on the fast-day in January 1637, and though his sermon was <b>encouraging</b> <b>to</b> his free grace allies, it was considered inflammatory by most of the colony's ministers.|$|E

In contrast, women <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> engage in societal blame for sex discrimination would be more likely to participate in non-normative actions aimed at enhancing the status of the group as a whole. Female students in Canada were subjected to a situation of discrimination and were <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> blame either themselves or social discrimination. They were then given the opportunity to respond to the discrimination by endorsing various actions.

2500|$|He {{was born}} in the outer {{district}} of Kath, the capital of the Afrighid dynasty of Khwarezm (now a part of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan) (or Chorasmia). The word Biruni means [...] "from the outer-district" [...] in Persian, and so this became his nisba: [...] "al-Bīrūnī" [...] = [...] "the Birunian". Al-Biruni's relatives also took interest in the studies of science as well, so he grew up in an environment <b>encouraging</b> <b>to</b> his interests. He even had ties to royalty as there are links in his family to the families of prestigious elites. To conduct research, Al-Biruni used different methods to tackle the various fields he studied. Many consider Al-Biruni one of the greatest scientists in history, and especially of Islam because of his discoveries and methodology. He lived during the Islamic Golden Age, which promoted astronomy and encouraged all scholars to work on their research. Al-Biruni spent the first twenty-five years of his life in Khwarezm where he studied Islamic jurisprudence, theology, grammar, mathematics, astronomy, medics, philosophy and also dabbled in the field of physics and most other sciences as well. The Iranian Khwarezmian language, which was the language of Biruni, survived for several centuries after Islam until the Turkification of the region, and so must some at least of the culture and lore of ancient Khwarezm, for {{it is hard to see}} the commanding figure of Biruni, a repository of so much knowledge, appearing in a cultural vacuum. He was sympathetic to the Afrighids, who were overthrown by the rival dynasty of Ma'munids in 995. He left his homeland for Bukhara, then under the Samanid ruler Mansur II the son of Nuh. There he corresponded with Avicenna and there are extant exchanges of views between these two scholars.|$|E
