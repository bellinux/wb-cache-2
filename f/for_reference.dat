The Regional Arts & Culture Council was searching for photographs showing the murals in their original location for an ongoing restoration project. In 2006, Randy Shelton reconstructed the artworks on the columns using the photographs <b>for</b> <b>reference.</b>|$|E

5|$|NY8 was {{truncated}} {{south to}} Hague , eliminating a lengthy overlap with NY22 and NY9N. Its former routing along Bridge Road became NY903, an unsigned reference route. The NY903 designation was later replaced with NY910L {{when a new}} numbering system <b>for</b> <b>reference</b> routes {{was adopted by the}} New York State Department of Transportation, and NY910L itself was redesignated and signed as NY185 on April4, 2008.|$|E
40|$|Information flow type systems, such as EnerJ (a type {{system for}} energy e ciency), and {{integrity}} and confidentiality, are unsound if subtyping <b>for</b> <b>references</b> is allowed {{because of the}} presence of mutable references. The standard approach is to disallow subtyping <b>for</b> <b>references,</b> or in other words, replace subtyping constraints with equality constraints. Unfortunately, this often leads to imprecision, causing the type system to reject valid programs. We observe that subtyping is safe when the left-hand-side of the assignment is immutable. Therefore, we compose information flow systems with reference immutability, which allows for limited subtyping <b>for</b> <b>references.</b> We infer types with the standard approach (i. e., no subtyping <b>for</b> <b>references),</b> and with the composition approach on 13 Java web applications. The composition approach achieves at least 20 % precision improvement over the standard approach...|$|R

5|$|Because the {{new game}} is set within a {{well-established}} franchise, Starbreeze tried {{to retain the}} essence of the world and rebuild these elements. The game's story was written by British science-fiction writer Richard K Morgan, whom the team approached after they read his book Altered Carbon. Syndicate was Morgan's second video-game script after 2011's Crysis 2; he used the original game <b>for</b> <b>reference</b> and included elements that those who had played it would immediately recognize. He preserved the original's dystopian setting and theme, and hoped to use these elements to build a powerful story. Morgan traveled to Sweden to meet Starbreeze's game designers to ensure the game's story would not contradict its overall design.|$|E
5|$|Costume {{designer}} Anthony Powell {{found it}} a challenge to create Connery's costume because the script required the character to wear the same clothes throughout. Powell thought about his own grandfather and incorporated tweed suits and fishing hats. Powell felt it necessary for Henry to wear glasses, but {{did not want to}} hide Connery's eyes, so chose rimless ones. He could not find any suitable, so he had them specially made. The Nazi costumes were genuine and were found in Eastern Europe by Powell's co-designer Joanna Johnston, to whom he gave research pictures and drawings <b>for</b> <b>reference.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lead {{production}} designer Richard Hudolin flew to Los Angeles, 1996 {{to gather}} material from Stargate <b>for</b> <b>reference</b> {{and found the}} original film prop stored outside in the Californian desert. Although the prop had severely disintegrated, he could take a detailed mould for Stargate SG-1 production to build its own prop. The new Stargate was engineered to turn, lock the chevrons, and be computer-controlled to dial specific gate addresses. A portable Stargate prop was built for on-location shoots and required six workers and one full day to set up. Since visual effects are sometimes faster and cheaper, a computer-generated Stargate was occasionally used in on-location shoots in later seasons.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used <b>for</b> <b>reference,</b> and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E
5|$|Animators created digital {{versions}} of the battle suits, at times with the soldiers inside them. On the set a 3D scanner booth digitized the actors, while hand scanners captured the textures of the practical suits. Imageworks received pieces of the suits <b>for</b> <b>reference.</b> The company's library of reflection data on various materials helped enhance the armor's shading. SPI's crew created the base at Heathrow by merging the set at Leavesden with digitally altered footage from the airport; the film's drop ships, barracks and mess halls, replaced the existing aircraft. Framestore created the digital Paris and recreated it with photomodeling from three days of visits. Given {{that the city is}} a no-fly zone, Framestore's artists obtained their aerial images by climbing an 80-meter crane parked in the Louvre courtyard. The quadcopter dropships were based on the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey that can tilt its rotors to fly as either planes or helicopters, while having a design closer to the Quad TiltRotor. Aside from the crashed ship on the beachhead and a gimbal set to depict the plane used by Cage's squad, the film used digital models for most ships. The computer-generated dropships had some of Imageworks' heaviest detail given the proximity of the actors to the aircraft in the camp scenes; the effects artists wanted to make sure the ships broke apart in a realistic way during the crashes.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Ralph's Spot {{was founded}} as a {{division}} of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse, a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. Bakshi was uninterested {{in the kind of}} animation the studio was turning out, and wanted to produce something personal. He soon developed Heavy Traffic, a tale of inner-city street life. Krantz told Bakshi that Hollywood studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi came across a copy of Robert Crumb's Fritz the Cat. Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film. Krantz arranged a meeting with Crumb, during which Bakshi presented the drawings he had created while learning the artist's distinctive style to prove that he could adapt Crumb's artwork to animation. Impressed by Bakshi's tenacity, Crumb lent him one of his sketchbooks <b>for</b> <b>reference.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} animators studied real-life animals <b>for</b> <b>reference,</b> as {{was done}} for the 1942 Disney film Bambi. Jim Fowler, renowned wildlife expert, visited the studios on several occasions {{with an assortment of}} lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings authenticity. The animators also studied animal movements at the Miami MetroZoo under guidance from wildlife expert Ron Magill. The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew. Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentaries—which employ telephoto lenses to shoot the wildlife from a distance. The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacher—which, following Scribner's request for realism, tried to depict effects such as lens flare—and the works of painters Charles Marion Russell, Frederic Remington and Maxfield Parrish. Because the characters were not anthropomorphized, all the animators had to learn to draw four-legged animals, and the story and character development was done through use of longer shots following the characters.|$|E
5|$|Artist Takayoshi Sato {{corrected}} {{inconsistencies in}} the plot, and designed the game's cast of characters. As a young employee, Sato was initially restricted to basic {{tasks such as}} font design and file sorting. He also created 3D demos and presentations, and taught older staff members the fundamentals of 3D modeling. However, he was not credited for this work as {{he did not have}} as much respect within Konami as older employees. Sato eventually approached the company's higher-ups with a short demo movie he had rendered, and threatened to withhold this technical knowledge from other staff members if he was not assigned to 3D work. As a consequence, his superior had to give in to his demand, and he was allowed to do character designs. Instead of relying on illustrations, Sato conceived the characters of Silent Hill while creating their computer-generated models. He gave each their own distinctive characteristics, but made Harry almost completely neutral as he wanted to avoid forcing interpretations of the game on the players. Creating the skull shapes for the faces of the American cast was difficult because he had no Caucasian co-workers to use <b>for</b> <b>reference.</b> Although Sato was largely responsible for the game's cinematics and characters at this point, his superior still did not want to fully credit his work, and intended to assign a visual supervisor to him. To prevent this from happening, Sato volunteered to create the full-motion videos of Silent Hill by himself. Over the course of two and a half years, he lived in the development team's office, as he had to render the scenes with the approximately 150 Unix-based computers of his coworkers after they left work {{at the end of a}} day.|$|E

5|$|The {{conditions}} for the race were dry, with a capacity crowd of some 40,000 fans turning out to watch the race. The drivers took to the track on Sunday morning for a 30-minute warm-up session. Both Williams cars maintained their good performance from qualifying; Coulthard was fastest with teammate Hill in second. Schumacher completed the top three positions. Herbert and Katayama both suffered from gearbox problems with their race cars, and elected to start the race with their teams' spare cars. The Simtek team did not {{take part in the}} session, as both drivers waited for stronger suspension components flown out from the United Kingdom to be fitted to the cars for the race. Minutes before the race started, a press release from the FIA was given to all media and team personnel, notifying them that the chromatographic analysis of the Elf fuel samples taken from Schumacher's Benetton and the Coulthard's Williams during qualifying did not match the sample provided by the fuel company {{before the start of the}} season <b>for</b> <b>reference</b> purposes, thus rendering both cars illegal. Both teams were fined $30,000 and raced under appeal, as the standard penalty for the offence was disqualification from the event. Neither Schumacher nor Coulthard were informed of the situation, as the teams did not want to unsettle their drivers before the race start. Hill and Herbert's races were not affected by the judgement, despite using the same type of fuel. Samples from Ferrari's Agip and McLaren's Mobil fuel were also tested; both were in accordance with the regulations. Though 26cars qualified for the race, only 25 took the start: Martini retired on the parade lap, his Minardi car suffering a gearbox problem.|$|E
