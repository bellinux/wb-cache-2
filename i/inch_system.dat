40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{one part of}} a four part project {{undertaken}} by four journalism students in the Marquette University Graduate School. The project as a whole analyses from different angles the coverage of two political campaigns in the 1954 elections by the two major Milwaukee newspapers, the Milwaukee Journal and the Milwaukee Sentinel. The campaigns chosen were the race for Governor between the Republican incumbent, Walter Kohler, and the Democratic nominee, William Proxmire, and the race for Representative from the Fifth Congressional District between the Republican incumbent Charles Kersten, and the Democratic nominee, Henry Reuss. The part of the project presented here is a content analysis, using a statement system, of all the news stories which appeared in the Milwaukee Journal over a 48 day period concerning these two campaigns. The goal of this part was to discover evidence of the presence or lack of bias in the journal. Mr. Richard Voelkel has completed a similar study of the Milwaukee Sentinel. Mr. Robert Weber has completed a study of both papers using a column <b>inch</b> <b>system</b> of analysis. Mr. Thomas Brennan is working on a study of the editorials in both papers and on an explanation of the background. Together, these four theses will comprise the first complete and thorough report on the performance of Milwaukee newspapers in a political campaign...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} program, TLIFE, which {{estimates the}} life, dynamic capacity, {{and reliability of}} aircraft transmissions, is presented. The program enables comparisons of transmission service life {{at the design stage}} for optimization. A variety of transmissions may be analyzed including: spur, helical, and spiral bevel reductions as well as series combinations of these reductions. The basic spur and helical reductions include: single mesh, compound, and parallel path plus revert star and planetary gear trains. A variety of straddle and overhung bearing configurations on the gear shafts are possible as is the use of a ring gear for the output. The spiral bevel reductions include single and dual input drives with arbitrary shaft angles. The program is written in FORTRAN 77 and has been executed both in the personal computer DOS environment and on UNIX workstations. The analysis may be performed in either the SI metric or the English <b>inch</b> <b>system</b> of units. The reliability and life analysis is based on the two-parameter Weibull distribution lives of the component gears and bearings. The program output file describes the overall transmission and each constituent transmission, its components, and their locations, capacities, and loads. Primary output is the dynamic capacity and 90 -percent reliability and mean lives of the unit transmissions and the overall system which can be used to estimate service overhaul frequency requirements. Two examples are presented to illustrate the information available for single element and series transmissions...|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} Maricopa, Marana, and Glendale, Arizona in 2001 to measure cotton growth, yield, micronaire, and production costs in single and double seed line per bed systems on 32 and 40 inch beds. Canopy development was faster and canopy closure was greater in the double seed line than in the single seed line systems and was greater in the 32 inch than in the 40 inch row systems. At Maricopa, the single line 32 <b>inch</b> <b>system</b> yield of 1571 lbs. /A was significantly greater than the yields of the other seed line/row spacing systems. The yields of the single line 40 and the double line 32 inch systems {{were not significantly different}} at 1476 and 1411 lbs. of lint/A, respectively, and the yields of the double line 32 and the double line 40 inch systems also were not significantly different at 1411 and 1396 lbs. of lint/A, respectively. There were no significant lint yield differences at the Marana or Glendale location. At Marana, the lint yields were 1063 and 1066 lbs. /A for the single and double seed line 40 inch row spacing systems, respectively. At Glendale, the single and double seed line 38 inch row spacing systems yielded 1474 and 1551 lbs. of lint/A, respectively. In all 2001 experiments, there was a trend for reduced micronaire in the double seed line per bed systems compared to the single seed line per bed systems. At Maricopa, the average micronaire was 5. 0 and 4. 7 for the single and double seed line per bed 32 inch row system, respectively, and 5. 2 and 4. 9 for the single and double seed line per bed 40 inch row systems, respectively. At Marana, the micronaire was 4. 7 and 4. 5 for the single and double seed line per bed 40 inch row systems, respectively. At Glendale, the micronaire was 5. 1 and 4. 6 for the single and double seed line per bed 38 inch row systems, respectively. Production costs were similar for the single and double seed line per bed systems. Additional research will be conducted in 2002 to determine the optimum plant populations and in-row plant spacings for double seed line per bed production systems...|$|E
40|$|BS 1916 {{limits and}} fits for {{engineering}} {{is based on}} ISA bulletin 25 which was first issued in 1921 and designed for use with the metric system. It provides {{a wide range of}} tolerances for holes and shafts from which it is possible by suitable selection to satisfy a wide range of engineering requirements. The basic principle underlying the system is the allocation of letters to signify the magnitude of the displacement of that part of the tolerance zone which is nearest to the basic size and a number to indicate the magnitude of the tolerance. Capital letters are used for holes, small letters for shafts. The numbers referred to as fundamental tolerances are common to holes and shafts. In applying the system to inch sizes care was taken to ensure that fit combinations (H 6 /k 4) would provide the same type of fit in the <b>inch</b> <b>system</b> as was established in the metric system throughout the whole of the Size range. It was also recommended that a unilateral hole basis be adopted in which the hole is the standard member and the tolerance specified as a value from nominal to plus an amount determined. by the number signifying the magnitude of the tolerance. Different types of fit are obtained by selecting from the standard shafts available the one whose fundamental deviation from basic size is considered to be the most suitable and :allocating to it a suitable standard tolerance When ISA bulletin 25 was issued great care was taken in selecting the disposition of the sizes allocated to standard shafts so that when one standard shaft was used with one standard hole it would provide a fit which -mould be functionally similar throughout the complete range of sizes. The decision of I. S. O. and B. S. I. to extend the size range from 20 inches to 200 inches caused reasonable doubts to exist about the reliability of this simple rule that one fit combination would be functionally similar throughout the whole of the extended size range. As this problem was examined in more detail cases were found where the above rule was not satisfactory over the extended or the smaller size range covered by the original standard (0. 040 ” to 20 ”). In considering the possibility of applying theoretical analysis to this problem {{it was clear that the}} most difficult section was that concerned with the selection of clearance fits for hydrodynamically lubricated plain 'beatings. The present paper is a preliminary survey into this problem and the detailed analysis is restricted to the application of lubrication theory to the selection of what appear to be optimum clearance fits for hydrodynamically lubricated bearings and the means that may be used for comparing these results with the recommendations of I. S. A. bulletin 25 and BS 1916. Figure 1 is a simplified representation of a plain bearing operating under conditions of hydrodynamic lubrication...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of the moments {{generated}} with low- and high-torque brackets. Four different bracket prescription-slot combinations of the same bracket type (Mini Diamond(R) Twin) were evaluated: high-torque 0. 018 and 0. 022 inch and low-torque 0. 018 and 0. 022 inch. These brackets were bonded on identical maxillary acrylic resin models with levelled and aligned teeth and each model was mounted on the orthodontic measurement and simulation system (OMSS). Ten specimens of 0. 017 x 0. 025 inch and ten 0. 019 x 0. 025 inch stainless steel archwires (ORMCO) were evaluated in the low- and high-torque 0. 018 inch and 0. 022 inch brackets, respectively. The wires were ligated with elastomerics into the brackets and each measurement was repeated once after religation. Two-way analysis of variance and t-test were conducted to compare the generated moments between wires at low- and high-torque brackets separately. The maximum moment generated by the 0. 017 x 0. 025 inch stainless steel archwire in the 0. 018 inch brackets at + 15 degrees ranged from 14. 33 and 12. 95 Nmm for the high- and low-torque brackets, respectively.
