[...] A business is an activity conducted regularly with an intent to make a profit. Only a few business related deductions are unique to a particular form of doing business.

40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{significance of}} branding {{as a source}} of value is explored by situating the creation and valorization of brand equity within ‘the full circuit of capital’. Conceived as a form of co-production occurring in the sphere of circulation (as well as production), brand-building is connected to: the surpluses generated by the labour of user-consumers as well as the designers and producers of branded products and services; the realization of surplus through control of revenues derived from sales of these products and services and the appropriation of surpluses, including the conversion of brand equity into brand value after <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> costs. Contemporary <b>investment</b> in branding is related to the financialization of brands as intangibles that make a growing contribution to market capitalization. By attending to multiple facets of the circuit of capital, including the co-production brand equity by user-consumers, some pointers are proposed for developing a more ‘joined-up’ view of the ‘bigger picture’ of contemporary capitalist reproduction...|$|R

In this article, we develop and apply a specific net present value (NPV) and an internal rate of return (IRR) approach to quantify the value created for the owners of the building by the investment in renovation via energy-saving investments that produce positive externalities. The model has an applied interest because, in recent years, a lot <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> in real estate were made by owners in order to increase the green quality of the buildings, and several funds of public aid were provided by the government to stimulate these energy-saving investments. The model proposed here is applied to a case study of a 16 -apartment building located in northern Italy considers the model attempts to quantify the initial investment value, the energy savings, the tax <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> the initial <b>investment</b> and the terminal value <b>of</b> the <b>investment</b> as the increase in building value. The analysis shows that the model is consistent in evaluating investments to improve building quality, and investments within the context of the specific case study considered in the research have IRRs ranging from a minimum of 4. 907 % to a maximum of 12. 980 %. It could even be useful to consider a sample of cases to verify whether our results are representative of this specific cas...|$|R

The Australian government had {{for many years}} been encouraging agricultural and forestry investment schemes by allowing investors to claim up-front tax <b>deductions</b> <b>of</b> the costs <b>of</b> <b>investment.</b> Investors paid Great Southern a fee to lease plantation woodlots. Great Southern managed the woodlot, and the investor could deduct {{the cost of the}} lease from the income they declared that year for tax assessment purposes. The tax deductible status <b>of</b> the <b>investment</b> was widely regarded as the main attraction of MIS schemes to investors.|$|R

He {{made the}} <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> Pure Concepts of the Understanding in the ""Critique of Pure Reason. "" It {{demostrated}} that the Categories had the objective validity in the empirical knowledge, {{because they were}} the conditions of experience. It does not go well similarly with the <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> the Principles of Pure Practical Reason. Though the Law of Morality stands fast as the fact of Pure Reason, how it has the objective validity in practice cannot be proved. But from this fact, the <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> Freedom becomes possible. The Possiblity of the freedom of will was allowed in the critique of theoretical reason, but the substance of freedom was not determined. So when the Pure Practical Reason determines the substance of freedom by its law. the freedom gets its contents,and real meaning. At the same time through the realizatron of this free will the Moral Law gets its objective reality. So the Reality of the Principles of Pure Practical Reason is demonstrated by the Possibility <b>of</b> the <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> Freedom,though the direct <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> those principles is impossible. ...|$|R
