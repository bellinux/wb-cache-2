40|$|AbstractNanocomposites {{are rapidly}} {{emerging}} as important engineering materials. This paper presents {{a study of}} the influence of multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on the drilled hole quality. The influence of MWCNTs was analyzed by comparing the drilled hole quality on epoxy/glass fabric polymeric composite fabricated with neat and MWCNTs filled epoxy matrix. Drilling tests were carried out on these materials with HSS twist drill of diameter 6 mm. Factorial design based experiments were conducted at chosen levels of cutting speeds and feed rates. Delamination factor was taken as a measure of hole quality. Image processing technique was used to measure the delamination factor at the entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>sides.</b> Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is employed to study the significance of the presence of MWCNTs and the effect of cutting parameters. Statistical analysis showed that the presence of MWCNTs has significantly improved the drilled hole quality both at the entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>sides...</b>|$|R

50|$|A Steckel mill, {{also known}} as a {{reversible}} finishing mill, is similar to a reversing rolling mill except two coilers are used to feed the material through the mill. One coiler is on the entrance side and the other on the <b>exit</b> <b>side.</b> The coilers pull the material through the mill, therefore the process is more similar to drawing than rolling. The material is fed back and forth through the mill until the desired thickness is reached, much like a reversing rolling mill.|$|E

50|$|Several {{methods are}} {{available}} for soft materials like plastic films and paper. Razor blades, straight, or circular blades are being used. Some blades cut through the material while others crush the material against a hard roll. Those are similar to knives and cut the material into narrow strips, which may be called coils when being rewound. The cuttings blades can be set to a desired width. Some machines have many blades to increase the options of cutting widths, others have just a single blade and can be set to a desired location. The slit material is rewound on paper, plastic or metal cores on the <b>exit</b> <b>side</b> of the machine.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two leading}} {{theories}} about how siphons cause liquid to flow uphill, against gravity, without being pumped, and powered only by gravity. The traditional theory for centuries was that gravity pulling the liquid {{down on the}} <b>exit</b> <b>side</b> of the siphon resulted in reduced pressure {{at the top of}} the siphon. Then atmospheric pressure was able to push the liquid from the upper reservoir, up into the reduced pressure {{at the top of the}} siphon, like in a barometer or drinking straw, and then over. However, it has been demonstrated that siphons can operate in a vacuum and to heights exceeding the barometric height of the liquid. Consequently, the cohesion tension theory of siphon operation has been advocated, where the liquid is pulled over the siphon in a way similar to the chain model. It need not be one theory or the other that is correct, but rather both theories may be correct in different circumstances of ambient pressure. The atmospheric pressure with gravity theory obviously cannot explain siphons in vacuum, where there is no significant atmospheric pressure. But the cohesion tension with gravity theory cannot explain CO2 gas siphons, siphons working despite bubbles, and the flying droplet siphon, where gases do not exert significant pulling forces, and liquids not in contact cannot exert a cohesive tension force.|$|E
40|$|SummaryISWI-family enzymes remodel {{chromatin}} by sliding nucleosomes along DNA, but the nucleosome translocation mechanism remains unclear. Here we use single-molecule FRET {{to probe}} nucleosome translocation by ISWI-family remodelers. Distinct ISWI-family members translocate nucleosomes {{with a similar}} stepping pattern maintained by the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. Nucleosome remodeling begins with a 7  bp step of DNA translocation followed by 3  bp subsequent steps toward the <b>exit</b> <b>side</b> of nucleosomes. These multi-bp, compound steps are comprised of 1  bp substeps. DNA movement on the entry side of the nucleosome occurs only after 7  bp of exit-side translocation, and each entry-side step draws in a 3  bp equivalent of DNA that allows three additional base pairs to be moved to the <b>exit</b> <b>side.</b> Our results suggest a remodeling mechanism with well-defined coordination at different nucleosomal sites featuring DNA translocation toward the <b>exit</b> <b>side</b> in 1  bp steps preceding multi-bp steps of DNA movement on the entry side...|$|E

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{permeation method}} {{is often used}} to study hydrogen diffusion and trapping in steels; unfortunately, there is great scatter in the experimental results. To identify the reason for this scattering, experiments were carried out usiug pure iron and pure palladium specimens. It is clearly shown that on the iron samples, surface phenomena are not controlled. In particular, the passive layer on the <b>exit</b> <b>side</b> induces variation of the hydrogen concentration on this side with time. On palladium samples, such phenomena can be controlled and stationary conditions as well as good reproducibility can be obtained.
