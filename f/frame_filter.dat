When compared to other compression filters, belt filters use relatively lower pressures. Although centrifuges have lower moisture content, lower costs and simpler operations in coal tails processing, belt filters tend to make less noise and have much quicker startup and shutdown times.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main basic types of filter presses: plate and <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> presses, {{recessed}} plate and <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> presses and automatic filter presses.|$|E
5000|$|An {{automatic}} {{filter press}} {{has the same}} concept as the manual filter and <b>frame</b> <b>filter,</b> except that the whole process is fully automated. It consists of larger plate and <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> presses with mechanical [...] "plate shifters". The function of the plate shifter is to move the plates and allow rapid discharge of the filter cakes accumulated in between the plates. It also contains a diaphragm compressor in the filter plates which aids in optimizing the operating condition by further drying the filter cakes. An animation showing this principal of operation can be seen here.|$|E
5000|$|Sampling {{frequency}} 8 kHz/13-bit (160 {{samples for}} 20 ms <b>frames),</b> <b>filtered</b> to 200-3400 Hz.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, hard zoning restricts actual {{communication}} {{across a}} fabric. This requires efficient hardware implementation (<b>frame</b> <b>filtering)</b> {{in the fabric}} switches, but is much more secure. That stated, modern switches will employ hard zoning when you implement soft.|$|R
30|$|Then, the key <b>frames</b> are <b>filtered</b> with a {{low-pass}} filter {{and the high}} frequency content is obtained as {{a difference between the}} original key <b>frames</b> and their <b>filtered</b> version.|$|R
50|$|Plate and <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> press produce up to 99% of solids recovery, and the {{moisture}} {{left in the}} cake commonly ranges from 15% to 20%. During cake washing, 90% of the filtrate can be removed by the wash liquid.|$|E
5000|$|A {{plate and}} <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> press {{is the most}} {{fundamental}} design, and many now refer it as a [...] "membrane filter plate". This type of filter press consists of many plates and frames assembled alternately with the supports {{of a pair of}} rails. The presence of a centrifuge pump ensures the remaining suspended solids do not settle in the system, and its main function is to deliver the suspension into each of the separating chambers in the plate and <b>frame</b> <b>filter.</b> For each of the individual separating chambers, there is one hollow filter frame separated from two filter plates by filter cloths. The introduced slurry flows through a port in each individual frame, and the filter cakes are accumulated in each hollow frame. As the filter cake becomes thicker, the filter resistance increases as well. So when the separating chamber is full, the filtration process is stopped as the optimum pressure difference is reached. The filtrate that passes through filter cloth is collected through collection pipes and stored in the filter tank. Filter cake (suspended solid) accumulation occurs at the hollow plate frame, then being separated at the filter plates by pulling the plate and <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> press apart. The cakes then fall off from those plates and are discharged to the final collection point.|$|E
50|$|Typical cloth {{areas can}} range from 1 m2 or less on {{laboratory}} scale to 1000 m2 in a production environment, even though plates can provide filter areas up to 2000 m2. Normally, plate and <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> press can form up to 50 mm of cake thickness, however, it can be push up to 200 mm for extreme cases. Recessed plate press can form up to 32 mm of cake thickness.|$|E

40|$|Communication is {{responsible}} for the majority of energy consumption in typical wireless sensor networks (WSNs). While transmission energy can be controlled at each node, reception energy is outside the control of the nodes because they usually do not know the arrival time of their packets and they cannot avoid overhearing packets directed to the other nodes in range. Energy-aware MAC protocols apply duty-cycling which keeps the radio module off for most of the time and wakes it up periodically, but they suffer from overhearing which has been addressed so far either by means of preambles or by means of separate wake-up channels. This paper proposes a complementary approach which exploits the hardware <b>frame</b> <b>filtering</b> capabilities provided by state-of-the-art radio transceivers. Extensive experiments performed on VirtualSense motes show that hardware <b>frame</b> <b>filtering</b> saves more than 50 % of the energy spent in the reception of non-intended packets...|$|R

50|$|A {{recessed}} plate filter press {{is made up}} of polypropylene squares at about 2 to 4 feet across with a concave depression and a hole in the center of each. Two plates join together to form a chamber to pressurize the slurry and squeeze the filtrate out through the filter cloth lining in the chamber. It is capable of holding 12 to 80 plates adjacent to each other, depending on the required capacity. When the filter press is closed, a series of chambers is formed. The differences with the plate and <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> are that the plates are joined together {{in such a way that}} the cake forms in the recess on each plate, meaning that the cake thickness is restricted to 32mm unless extra frames are used as spacers. However, there are disadvantages to this method, such as longer cloth changing time, inability to accommodate filter papers, and the possibility of forming uneven cake.|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear {{diffusion}} filtering and wavelet/frame shrinkage are two popular {{methods for}} signal and image denoising. The {{relationship between these}} two methods has been studied recently. In this paper we investigate the correspondence between frame shrinkage and nonlinear diffusion. We show that the frame shrinkage of Ron-Shenâ€™s continuous-linear-spline-based tight frame {{is associated with a}} fourth-order nonlinear diffusion equation. We derive high-order nonlinear diffusion equations associated with general tight frame shrinkages. These high-order nonlinear diffusion equations are different from the high-order diffusion equations studied in the literature. We also construct two sets of tight <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> banks which result in the sixth- and eighth-order nonlinear diffusion equations. The correspondence between frame shrinkage and diffusion filtering is useful to design diffusion-inspired shrinkage functions with competitive performance. On the other hand, the study of such a correspondence leads to a new type of diffusion equations and helps to design frame-inspired diffusivity functions. The denoising results with diffusion-inspired shrinkages provided in this paper are promising.

40|$|This {{paper is}} to {{construct}} tight wavelet frame systems containing a set of canonical filters by applying the unitary extension principle of [20]. A set of filters are canonical if the filters in this set are generated by flipping, adding a conjugation with a proper sign adjusting from one filter. The simplest way to construct wavelets of s-variables {{is to use the}} 2 sâˆ’ 1 canonical filters generated by the refinement mask of a box spline. However, almost all wavelets (except Haar or the tensor product of Haar) defined by the canonical filters associated with box splines do not form a tight wavelet frame system. We consider how to build a filter bank by adding filters to a canonical filter set generated from the refinement mask of a box spline in low dimension, so that the wavelet system generated by this filter bank forms a tight frame system. We first prove that for a given low dimension box spline of s-variables, one needs at least additional 2 s filters {{to be added to the}} canonical filters from the refinement mask (that leads to the total number of highpass filters in the filter bank to be 2 s+ 1 âˆ’ 1) to have a tight wavelet frame system. We then provide several methods with many interesting examples of constructing tight wavelet systems with the minimal number of framelets that contain canonical filters generated by the refinement masks of box splines. The supports of the resulting framelets are not bigger than that of the corresponding box spline whose refinement mask is used to generate the first 2 s âˆ’ 1 canonical filters in the filter bank. In many of our examples, the tight <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> bank has the double-canonical property, meaning it is generated by adding another set of canonical filters generated from a highpass filter to the canonical filters generated by the refinement mask to make a tight frame system.

40|$|When {{one looks}} at SOHO/EIT Fe XII images of quiet regions, {{one can see the}} {{conventional}} coronal bright points (> 10 arcsec in diameter), but one will also notice many smaller faint enhancements in brightness (Figure 1). Do these micro coronal bright points belong to the same family as the conventional bright points? To investigate this question we compared SOHO/EIT Fe XII images with Kitt Peak magnetograms to determine whether the micro bright points are in the magnetic network and mark magnetic bipoles within the network. To identify the coronal bright points, we applied a picture <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> to the Fe XII images; this brings out the Fe XII network and bright points (Figure 2) and allows us to study the bright points down to the resolution limit of the SOHO/EIT instrument. This picture <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> is a square smoothing function (hlargelyalf a network cell wide) with a central square (quarter of a network cell wide) removed so that a bright point's intensity does not effect its own background. This smoothing function is applied to the full disk image. Then we divide the original image by the smoothed image to obtain our filtered image. A bright point is defined as any contiguous set of pixels (including diagonally) which have enhancements of 30 % or more above the background; a micro bright point is any bright point 16 pixels or smaller in size. We then analyzed the bright points that were fully within quiet regions (0. 6 x 0. 6 solar radius) centered on disk center on six different days...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{describes}} {{a new set}} of dyadic wavelet frames with two generators. The construction is simple, yet the wavelets cover the time-frequency plane in an arrangement that provides a higher sampling in both time and frequency. Specifically, the spectrum of the first wavelet is concentrated halfway between the spectrum of the second wavelet and the spectrum of its dilated version. In addition, the second wavelet is translated by half-integers rather than whole-integers in the frame construction. This arrangement leads to an expansive wavelet transform that is approximately shift-invariant and has intermediate scales. The wavelet frames presented in this paper are compactly supported and have vanishing moments. Index Terms â€” wavelet transform, <b>frame,</b> <b>filter</b> bank, shiftinvariant. I...|$|E

Another beauty of this approach is that a structural relationship exists between the SRF filter and its stationary frame state variable implementation, which allows the approach to be easily extended to higher order filters or controller structures...|$|E
40|$|Replacing the {{kernel of}} the Fourier {{transformation}} by an arbitrary kernel of a unitary integral transformation, the sliding-window Fourier transformation and the wavelet transformation are generalized. This leads to so-called windowed unitary transformations. Perfect reconstructing formulas are deduced generalizing the known formulas of the sliding-window Fourier transformation and the wavelet transformation. For subsampling of the windowed unitary spectrum of signals {{it will be}} shown that, on one hand they may be reconstructed using frame theory, {{on the other hand}} reconstructed using filter bank theory.

40|$|In {{the past}} thirty years, {{research}} on textures has been pursued along two different lines. The first line of research, pioneered by Julesz (1962), seeks essential ingredients in terms of features and statistics in human texture perception.

Images in the Julesz ensemble are defined on a large image lattice (a mathematical idealization being Z&sup 2;) so that exact constraint on feature statistics makes sense. The second line of research studies Markov random field (MRF) models that characterize texture patterns on finite (or small) image lattice in a statistical way.
