5|$|English castles, {{including}} Kenilworth, did {{not play}} a decisive role during the Wars of the Roses (1455–85), which were fought primarily {{in the form of}} pitched battles between the rival factions of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists. With the mental collapse of King Henry VI, Queen Margaret used the Duchy of Lancaster lands in the Midlands, including Kenilworth, as one of <b>her</b> <b>key</b> bases of military support. Margaret removed Henry from London in 1456 for his own safety and until 1461, Henry's court divided almost all its time among Kenilworth, Leicester and Tutbury Castle for the purposes of protection. Kenilworth remained an important Lancastrian stronghold {{for the rest of the}} war, often acting as a military balance to the nearby castle of Warwick. With the victory of Henry VII at Bosworth, Kenilworth again received royal attention; Henry visited frequently and had a tennis court constructed at the castle for his use. His son, Henry VIII, decided that Kenilworth should be maintained as a royal castle. He abandoned the Pleasance and had part of the timber construction moved into the base court of the castle.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 2000s, Amuro {{released}} Play, which was highlighted {{as one of}} <b>her</b> <b>key</b> re-inventions of her entire career. Sonically, the record relied on R and hip hop elements, but started to involve contemporary dance-pop music; to an extent, Tills from AllMusic compared the effort to the works of Jennifer Lopez and En Vogue. 2012's Uncontrolled saw yet another transition with her sound, leaving R and focusing on electronic dance music. Additionally, this saw her first experimentation with full-length English language tracks. Unlike her previous records, Uncontrolled ventured into Western and Korean practitioners to helm the collection, including the likes of The Nervo Twins, Henrik Nordenback, Christian Fast, and Peter Mansson. This trend also moved onto her follow-up album Feel, where she worked with artists such as Hook n Sling, Dsign Music and Zedd. Her final studio album, Genic (2015), was her first record to not be handled by Japanese producers, and her only record to induce all its tracks with English language.|$|E
