50|$|A <b>draw</b> <b>sheet</b> {{is a small}} {{bed sheet}} placed {{crosswise}} over {{the middle of the}} bottom sheet of a mattress to cover the area between the person's upper back and thighs, often used by medical professionals to move patients. It can be made of plastic, rubber, or cotton, and is about half the size of a regular sheet. It can be used in place of a mattress pad if a rubber mattress is used. The <b>draw</b> <b>sheet</b> {{may or may not be}} tucked into the sides of the bed. When a <b>draw</b> <b>sheet</b> is used to move patients, it is sometimes known as a lift sheet. Nursing manuals recommend that, when a plastic or rubber <b>draw</b> <b>sheet</b> is used, a cotton drawsheet is placed over it. If a folded sheet is used as a <b>draw</b> <b>sheet,</b> the folded edge of the sheet is positioned at the person's upper body. <b>Draw</b> <b>sheets</b> used as lift sheets are generally not tucked in, though sometimes after the move, they are.|$|R
50|$|A {{fitted sheet}} {{goes over the}} mattress.

By lifting the <b>draw</b> <b>sheet,</b> it is used to help move the patient. The fitted <b>sheet</b> and <b>draw</b> <b>sheet,</b> which are those that go under the patient, are firmly tucked in to prevent wrinkles, which can promote skin breakdown. A top sheet and blanket are often placed over the bed and the corners are mitered.|$|R

50|$|Cathedral glass {{has been}} used {{extensively}} in churches (often for non-pictorial windows) and for decorative glass in domestic and commercial buildings, both leaded and not, often in conjunction with <b>drawn</b> <b>sheet</b> glass and sometimes with decorative sections of beveled glass. It lets in light while reducing visibility and is an inexpensive, but useful and decorative material. While it doesn't have the richness and versatility of hand-blown glass, it {{has been used}} successfully for the creation of modern stained-glass windows in which the texture of the glass is treated, with the color, as a significant design element.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drawn</b> <b>Sheet</b> {{glass was}} made by dipping a leader into a vat of molten glass then pulling that leader {{straight}} up while a film of glass hardened {{just out of the}} vat - this is known as the Fourcault process. This film or ribbon was pulled up continuously held by tractors on both edges while it cooled. After 12 metres or so it was cut off the vertical ribbon and tipped down to be further cut. This glass is clear but has thickness variations due to small temperature changes just out of the vat as it was hardening. These variations cause lines of slight distortions. This glass may still be seen in older houses. Float glass replaced this process.|$|E

50|$|The Gubal is {{a musical}} {{instrument}} developed by the Swiss company PANArt Hang Manufacturing Ltd.. It is a vessel made of PANArt's patented Pang, a deep <b>drawn</b> <b>sheet</b> steel permeated by iron nitride needles. Pang was developed by PANArt for steelpan construction {{in the middle of}} the 1990s. Examining the characteristics of their new material the PANArt tuners Sabina Schärer and Felix Rohner created a number of different Pang instruments. In the year 2001 they introduced the Hang. The Gubal was the first Pang instrument that was developed after the Hang. It was introduced in Summer 2013 on occasion of the 20th anniversary of PANArt. The name Gubal is registered as trademark for musical instruments by PANArt Hang Manufacturing Ltd.|$|E

This paper presents the research work involved {{in the development of}} a knowledge based system for cost-{{estimation of}} deep <b>drawn</b> <b>sheet</b> metal parts. The proposed system is structured in form of two modules viz., module COMPC for estimation of total manufacturing cost of deep drawn parts and module TOOLC for estimation of total tooling cost of deep drawing tool. The system modules are coded in VB. 6. 0 in windows operating environment. The system has been tested for various types of axisymmetric deep <b>drawn</b> <b>sheet</b> metals parts taken from industries.

40|$|Material {{processing}} such as rolling {{most certainly}} introduces a preferred orientation (or texture) in the material. This anisotropy in mechanical properties {{has an important}} effect on the fabricability of the metal. For example, when drawing a cylindrical metal sheet, ears are formed around {{the top edge of}} the <b>drawn</b> <b>sheet</b> as shown in Fig. 1. These ears result from the sheet metal being stronger in one direction than in other directions in the plane of the sheet. This is also referred to as planar anisotropy which causes different deformations in various directions. In order to assure the quality of the product and to improve the manufacturing process, an effective way of measuring crystallographic texture has been sought for decades...|$|E

40|$|Aluminium is a {{potential}} light weight alternative to steel for deep <b>drawn</b> <b>sheet</b> components, but generally does not compare well to steels in terms of formability. Research in polycrystalline plasticity indicates applying shear to rolled fcc alloys improves their deep drawability by favourably modifying their crystallographic texture. Such processing could be realised industrially by cold asymmetric rolling (ASR), {{but in order to}} gain detailed understanding of the influence of process parameters on the evolution and through thickness homogeneity of the texture a validated full field multi-scale model of the process is required. This study examines the ability of a hierarchical multi-scale approach to predict evolved textures for aluminium sheet subjected to a mechanical test exhibiting a deformation mode relevant for ASR, namely simple shear. The homogeneity of the deformation field is assessed with full field strain measurement by digital image correlation, and macrotexture is measured by x-ray diffraction. The discrepancies are discussed and further work to validate the modelling approach for simulation of texture evolution in the ASR process is briefly outlined. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{knowledge}} based system (KBS) for checking manufacturability of deep <b>drawn</b> <b>sheet</b> metal parts is described. For the development of proposed system technical knowledge acquired from different sources of knowledge acquisition is framed {{in the form of}} production rules of ‘IF-THEN ’ variety and then coded using AutoLISP language. For consultation, the user loads the system into the prompt area of AutoCAD. The proposed system generates friendly prompt eliciting from the user for data pertaining to the job at hand. The system output includes recommendations on suitability of geometrical features of the part for required manufacturing operations. The system is flexible and its knowledge base can be extended and modified as old manufacturing facilities are discarded or newer ones are acquired in a particular enterprise. Effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated by taking an example of an industrial sheet metal part. The low cost of implementation of proposed system makes it affordable for small and medium scale sheet metal industries. The design activity represents only a small portion (5 to 15 percent) of total production costs of a sheet metal parts. However, decisions made at design stage have a profound effect upon manufacturing, maintenance, and life cycle cost of a product. It is generally estimated that decision...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{is a report}} of the Light Duty Utility Arm (LDUA) drawing walkdown. The purpose of this walkdown was to validate the essential configuration of the LDUA in preparation of deploying the equipment in a Hanford waste tank. The LDUA system has, over the course of its development, caused the generation of a considerable number of design drawings. The number of drawings is estimated to be well over 1, 000. A large number consist of vendor type drawings, furnished by both Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and SPAR Aerospace Limited (SPAR). A smaller number, approximately 200, are H- 6 type <b>drawing</b> <b>sheets</b> in the Project Hanford Management Contract (PHMC) document control system. A preliminary inspection of the drawings showed that the physical configuration of the LDUA did not match the documented configuration. As a result of these findings, a scoping walkdown of 20 critical <b>drawing</b> <b>sheets</b> was performed to determine if a problem existed in configuration management of the LDUA system. The results of this activity showed that 18 of the 20 <b>drawing</b> <b>sheets</b> were found to contain errors or omissions of varying concern. Given this, Characterization Engineering determined that a walkdown of the drawings necessary and sufficient to enable safe operation and maintenance of the LDUA should be performed. A review team was assembled to perform a review of all of the drawings and determine the set which would need to be verified through an engineering walkdown. The team determined that approximately 150 H- 6 type <b>drawing</b> <b>sheets</b> would need to be verified, 12 SPAR/PNNL <b>drawing</b> <b>sheets</b> would need to be verified and converted to H- 6 drawings, and three to six new drawings would be created (see Appendix A).
