40|$|The project PC/Microcontroller based {{drilling}} machine is an on going project which originally {{began as an}} EN 300 project in semester 2, 2001 at the Department of Engineering, USP. The <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> which is {{a component of the}} {{drilling machine}} was not fully functional at the completion of the EN 300 project. Also, many of the amplifier circuits and feedback circuits were either not fully functional or not done at all. This project report focuses on troubleshooting and improving the existing <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> design so that data can be accurately communicated between the PC or microcontroller and the various hardware associated with the drilling machine. The report also describes how an output from the interfacing card is amplified so that it can energize the solenoids that would hold the work piece in place during drilling. In addition to this, the report also explains how the feedback circuits of the drilling machine are connected to the <b>interfacing</b> <b>board.</b> An <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> prototype has been produced that communicates data accurately between the PC and the various drilling machine hardware. To validate this testing has been carried out using switches, LED’s and laboratory power supplies in the first instance and then via connections to the PC’s parallel port and running test programs from the PC to read and write data from the <b>interfacing</b> <b>board.</b> Final testing has been carried out by integrating the <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> {{with the rest of the}} drilling machine components. An amplifier circuit has also been produced that facilitates the correct operation of the clamping solenoids to hold a work piece in place during the drilling process. To validate this testing has also been carried out using laboratory power supplies as well as connecting the amplifier circuit to an output of the <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> and running test programs from the PC and eventually testing its performance with the rest of the drilling machine components. The feedback circuits designed for the various limit switches and work piece detector associated with the drilling machine are fully operational and functional. Testing very much similar to that for the amplifier circuit for the clamping solenoids has been carried out to validate this. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Mobile {{devices have}} a variety of {{built-in}} sensors (e. g., accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, camera etc.) that allow them to be used {{in a wide range of}} context-aware mobile applications. Additionally, their built-in communication interfaces - like WiFi, Bluetooth and USB - let them communicate with external devices and sensors. Using built-in and external sensors, mobile devices help bridge the physical and digital worlds by providing precise readings on various natural phenomena (e. g., environmental and soil conditions). Creating mobile sensing applications poses the following challenges for developers: *	Sensors often have only low-level communication interfaces; hence, an <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> is needed to connect them to mobile devices. *	Partitioning a sensing application between a mobile device running an OS like Android or iOS and an <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> that likely has an embedded OS at best, adds complexity to the system. *	In addition to implementing application logic, developers must overcome the quirks of different physical communication channels and process sensor-specific data. My thesis addresses these challenges by: (1) extending the sensing capabilities and modalities of mobile devices, and (2) simplifying the development of mobile sensing applications. To this end, the thesis makes the following contributions: *	Hardware to enhance and simplify a mobile device's ability to connect to various types of sensors *	A software framework to simplify development of mobile sensing applications *	Implementation and evaluation of sensing systems to enhance workflows in low-resource settings The research leading to my thesis explored different hardware options to interface low-level sensors to mobile devices of varying capabilities, ranging from low-tier, non-programmable phones to smartphones and tablets. I developed the Open Data Kit (ODK) Sensors framework for Android devices to simplify the development of mobile applications that interact with sensors. Using sensor <b>interfacing</b> <b>boards</b> and ODK Sensors as building blocks, I developed applications that have been deployed to address critical global health issues in developing countries. Further, the general-purpose technology building blocks are now being used in a variety of mobile sensing applications...|$|R
40|$|Two {{complementary}} wireless sensor nodes {{for building}} two-tiered heterogeneous networks are presented. A larger node with a 25 mm by 25 mm size {{acts as the}} backbone of the network, and can handle complex data processing. A smaller, cheaper node with a 10 mm by 10 mm size can perform simpler sensor-interfacing tasks. The 25 mm node is based on previous work that has been done in the Tyndall National Institute that created a modular wireless sensor node. In this work, a new 25 mm module is developed operating in the 433 / 868 MHz frequency bands, with a range of 3. 8 km. The 10 mm node is highly miniaturised, while retaining a high level of modularity. It has been designed to support very energy efficient operation for applications with low duty cycles, with a sleep current of 3. 3 μA. Both nodes use commercially available components and have low manufacturing costs to allow the construction of large networks. In addition, <b>interface</b> <b>boards</b> for communicating with nodes have been developed for both the 25 mm and 10 mm nodes. These <b>interface</b> <b>boards</b> provide a USB connection, and support recharging of a Li-ion battery from the USB power supply.
