5|$|After the {{discovery}} of flerovium and livermorium was recognized by IUPAC on 1 June 2011, IUPAC asked {{the discovery}} team at the JINR to suggest permanent names <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> elements. The Dubna team chose to name element 114 flerovium (symbol Fl), after the Russian Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (FLNR), named after the Soviet physicist Georgy Flyorov (also spelled Flerov); earlier reports claim the element name was directly proposed to honour Flyorov. In accordance with the proposal received from the discoverers IUPAC officially named flerovium after the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (an older name for the JINR), not after Flyorov himself. Flyorov is known for writing to Stalin in April 1942 and pointing out the silence in scientific journals {{in the field of}} nuclear fission in the United States, Great Britain, and Germany. Flyorov deduced that this research must have become classified information in those countries. Flyorov's work and urgings {{led to the development of}} the USSR's own atomic bomb project.|$|E

25|$|The sketch was {{conceived}} when SCTV {{moved to the}} CBC television network.

The CBC network heads asked the show's producers to add specifically identifiably Canadian content <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> minutes. Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas thought that this was a ridiculous request, given that the show had been taped in Canada, with a mostly Canadian cast and crew, for two years.

25|$|Note {{that this}} {{principle}} only holds strictly for light reflected at normal incidence. For instance, right circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at grazing incidence (an angle beyond the Brewster angle) will still emerge as right handed, but elliptically, polarized. Light reflected by a metal at non-normal incidence will generally have its ellipticity changed as well. Such situations may {{be solved by}} decomposing the incident circular (or other) polarization into components of linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, commonly denoted p and s respectively. The reflected components in the p and s linear polarizations are found by applying the Fresnel coefficients of reflection, which are generally different <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> linear polarizations. Only in the special case of normal incidence, {{where there is no}} distinction between p and s, are the Fresnel coefficients for the two components identical, leading to the above property.|$|E
25|$|A renewed {{application}} {{for permission to}} bring a judicial review was made by Lutfur Rahman in August 2016, after the Metropolitan Police concluded in March 2016 there was insufficient evidence to bring a criminal prosecution. As part of the renewed application, permission to reopen the original judicial review application was seeked and granted by Ouseley J. The August 2016 application {{took the form of}} an {{application for}} permission to amend the grounds of the July 2015 judicial review claim. Three additional grounds for review were seeked by Rahman. The first two grounds rely on Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights arguing that the election court findings are incompatible with the presumption of innocence and right to a fair trial, given the subsequent decision of the Metropolitan Police. Permission <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> grounds were rejected by the divisional court with the findings that Rahman was at no point charged with a criminal offence for the purpose of Article 6, and that there were no parallel criminal proceedings alongside civil proceedings of the election court. Permission to include the second ground was additionally denied on the basis of undue delay in raising the issue by Rahman. Under the third ground, Rahman seeked a declaratory judgment that the Metropolitan Police decision to discontinue criminal investigation into him constituted an acquittal, and thus triggering the power of a court to order the cessation of the incapacity previously imposed by the election court judgment. Permission was denied based on the earlier finding that Rahman had not been charged, and thus impossible to have been acquitted on a prosecution.|$|E
