25|$|The anti-Franco {{opposition}} {{failed in}} their attempts to provoke the dictators downfall, and after his death they started a process of negotiation with the government that led to the Spanish transition to democracy, in which Spain chose a democratic parliamentary monarchy as the form of government, with the support of groups that had previously advocated a republic, like the PSOE and the PCE.

Electoral support for both parties increased after 1929 as the Great Depression hit the economy hard, producing many unemployed men who became available for the paramilitary units. The Nazis, with a mostly rural and lower middle class base, overthrew the Weimar regime and ruled Germany in 1933–1945; the KPD, with a mostly urban and working class base, came to power (in the East) in 1945–1989.|$|E

25|$|The period {{following}} Antonescu's fall returned Romania to a <b>democratic</b> <b>regime</b> and the 1923 Constitution, {{as well as}} its {{participation in}} the war alongside the Allies. However, it also saw the early stages of a communist takeover—which culminated with King Michael's forced abdication on December 30, 1947 and the subsequent establishment of Communist Romania. The Antonescu trial thus fit into a long series of similar procedures and political purges on charges of collaborationism, instrumented by the Romanian People's Tribunals and various other institutions. During the rigged general election of 1946 and for years after Ion Antonescu's execution, the Romanian Communist Party and its allies began using the implications of his trial as an abusive means of compromising some of their political opponents. One such early example was Iuliu Maniu, by then one of the country's prominent anti-communists, who was accused of being a fascist and an Antonescu sympathizer, mainly for having shaken his hand during the trial. The enlistment of ethnic Germans into Nazi German units, as approved by Antonescu, was used as a pretext for a Soviet-led expulsion of Germans from Romania. On similar grounds, the Soviet occupation forces organized the capture of certain Romanian citizens, as well as the return of war refugees from Romania proper into Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. Both the arrestees and the returnees were often deported deeper into the Soviet Union. As part of its deteriorating relationship with Romanian Roman Catholics, and urged on by the Soviets, the communist cabinet of Petru Groza also deemed Apostolic Nuncio Andrea Cassulo a collaborator of Antonescu and a persona non grata, based on transcripts of the Cassulo-Antonescu conversations. It also used such allegations to pressure several Greek-Catholic clergymen into accepting union with the Romanian Orthodox Church.|$|E

30|$|Another related {{issue is}} whether authoritarian or <b>democratic</b> <b>regimes</b> have {{different}} levels of social spending. Some authors believe that <b>democratic</b> <b>regimes</b> have higher social costs due to high electoral risks. In this sense, Avelino et al. (2005) observe that countries in transition towards democracy {{may be able to}} increase social spending for the poor, because of the strength of this population sector’s voting power. Regarding social spending categories, Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo (2001) and Avelino et al. (2005) find a strong positive association between democracy and education spending in Latin America, as governments attempt to attract more voters through proper educational programs, or because there is a high percentage of young people in the population, which makes it more attractive for the government to spend on education. However, Avelino et al. (2005) do not find any significant correlation between democracy and spending on health and social security. Huber et al. (2008) indicate that, regardless of their ideological orientation, <b>democratic</b> <b>regimes</b> have a long-term positive impact on both social security spending and health/education spending. Conversely, highly repressive authoritarian governments have negative effects on health and education expenditures, but they do not affect social security and welfare spending. This difference can be explained with the median voter theorem (Boix 1998; Dion 2006), which states that <b>democratic</b> <b>regimes</b> have higher social expenditures because they take into account the whole population in their welfare decisions and therefore the income of the median voter is lower than it would be in authoritarian regimes, where social spending would be targeted at the smaller group of supporters who benefit from the regime. On the other hand, authoritarian regimes may take more drastic decisions for or against social spending than in the case of <b>democratic</b> <b>regimes,</b> due to the absence of “veto points” characterised by Immergut (1990) or “veto players” postulated by Tsebelis (2002), provided by different political systems to interest groups by not allowing them to gain veto power to block political reforms.|$|R

6000|$|Let this {{mechanic}} {{form and}} vulgar legibility notify {{you a little}} at the start that I am in rather a hampered and hindered state, and that that must plead both for my delay in acknowledging your dear faithful letter of the New Year time, and for my at last having {{to make the best}} of this too impersonal art.... I won't go into the history of my woes--all the more that I really hope I have shuffled the worst of them off. Even in this most recent form they have been part and parcel of the grave illness that overtook me as long ago as at the New Year, 1910, and with a very imperfect recovery from which I was struggling during those weary American months of winter-before-last when we planned so in vain that I should come to you in Washington. I have deeply regretted, ever since, my failure of that pleasure--all the more that I don't see it now as conceivably again within my reach. I am restored to this soil, for whatever may remain to me of my mortal career. The grand swing across the globe, which you and Harry will again nobly accomplish--again and yet again--now simply mocks at my weakness and my reduced resources. Besides, I am but too thankful to have a refuge in which continuously to crouch. Please fix well in your mind that continuity--as making it easy for you some day to find me here. The continuity is broken simply by my reverting to the country for the summer and autumn--a mere change from the blue bed to the brown, and then from the brown back again to this Thames-side perch, which I call the blue. I hang here, for six months, straight over the River and find it delightful and interesting, at once ever so quiet and ever so animated. The River has a quantity of picturesque and dramatic life and motion that one had never appreciated till one had thrown oneself on it de confiance. But it's another London, this old Chelsea of simplifications and sacrifices, from the world in which I so like to feel that I for so long lived more or less with you. I feel somehow as much away from that now as you and Harry must feel amid your new Washington horizons--and it has of itself, for that matter, gone to pieces under the sweep of the big broom of Time, which has scattered it without ceremony. A few vague and altered relics of it occasionally dangle for a moment before me. I was going to say [...] "cross my path"--but I haven't now such a thing as a path, or it goes such a very few steps. I try meanwhile to project myself in imagination into your Washington existence--and, besides your own allusions to it, a passing visit a few days since from Walter Berry helped me a little to fix the shining vision. W. B. had been, I gathered, but a day or two near you, and wasn't in possession of many particulars. Beyond this, too, though you shine to me you shine a bit fearfully--for I can't rid myself (in a world of Chelsea limits and fashions) of a sense of the formidable, the somehow--at least for the likes of me!--difficult and bristling and glaring, side of the American conditions. However, you of course lightly ride the whirlwind--or at any rate have only as much or as little of the storms as you will, and can pick out of it only such musical thunder-rolls and most purely playful forked lightnings as suit you best. What I mean is that here, after a fashion, a certain part of the work of discrimination and selection and primary clearing of the ground is already done for one, in a manner that enables one to begin, for one's self, further on or higher up; whereas over there I seemed to see myself, speaking only from my own experience, often beginning so [...] "low down," [...] just in that way of sifting and selecting, that all one's time went to it and one was spent before arriving at any very charming altitude. This you will find obscure, but study it well--though strictly in private, so as not to give me away as a sniffy critic. Heaven knows I indulge in the most remorseless habits of criticism here--even if I make no great public use of them, through the increasing privacy and antiquity of my life. I kind of wonder about the bearing of the queer <b>Democratic</b> <b>régime</b> that seems as yet so obscurely to loom upon any latent possibilities (that might have been) on Harry's and your [...] "career"--just as I wonder what unutterable queerness may not, as a feature of the whole conundrum, [...] "representatively" [...] speaking, before long cause us all here to sit up and stare: one or two such startling rumours about the matter, I trust groundless, having already had something of that effect. But we must all wait, mustn't we? and I do indeed envy you both your so interesting opportunity for doing so, in a front box at the comedy, or tragedy, the fine old American show, that is, whatever turn it takes: it will all give you, these next months, so much to look at and talk about and expertly appreciate. Lord, how I wish I were in a state or situation to be dining with you to-night! I am dying, really, to see your House--which means alas that I shall die without doing so. No glimmer of a view of the new Presidential family as a White House group has come my way--so that I sit in darkness there as all around, and feel you can but say that it serves me right not to have managed my life better--especially with your grand example!

40|$|This paper uses {{survival}} or event-history {{analysis to}} test hypotheses about {{the explanation of}} welfare state retrenchment in 18 long-standing, affluent democracies. Retrenchments are conceived as events: reversals of previously expansionary trajectories of welfare state outputs. Key findings are that high levels of social spending and underlying rates of unemployment strongly and consistently propel retrenchment, complemented by economic affluence, which delays it, and openness to direct foreign investment, which also promotes retrenchment. Esping-Andersen's (1990 1999) socialinsurance-centered policy regimes mediate processes determining retrenchment. Consistent with Pierson (2001), we find that Anglo-“liberal ” and “social <b>democratic</b> ” policy <b>regimes,</b> especially liberal regimes, promote high degrees of retrenchment. We also find that when lagged welfare effort is included in a model, its appears to notably advanced welfare effort in Anglo-liberal and social <b>democratic</b> <b>regimes,</b> though not in "conservative ” ones; and that when it is deleted as an intervening variables, the unemployment rate appears to do just the same, promoting retrenchment in Angloliberal and social <b>democratic</b> <b>regimes</b> along, significantly more so in Anglo-liberal regimes. With budgetary variables omitted, signs that neocorporatism and Christian Democratic rule block retrenchments emerge. Overall, high welfare spending and underlying unemployment rates, somewhat offset by economic affluence, appear central to retrenchment, accelerating and intensifying it outside of Esping-Andersen's "conservative " or "social insurance " regimes, especially so in Anglo- liberal regimes, less so in social <b>democratic</b> <b>regimes.</b> 2 Welfare Retrenchment and the “New Politics”: Explainin...|$|R
