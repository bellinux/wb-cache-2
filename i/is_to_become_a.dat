5|$|With {{regards to}} the plot, the {{producers}} wanted to repeat the same style as the previous sixth series and include another story-arc in the seventh. The writers and producers got together {{to think about what}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> big political story that will affect the United Kingdom in twelve to eighteen months time. They decided on using the resurgence of power in Russia following the end of the Cold War, which the producers felt in subtle ways, is threatening the security of the West. The new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying, truth, and who the character should trust. The episode was written by Neil Cross. It was also additionally written by Ben Richards.|$|E
5|$|Populous: The Beginning {{takes place}} before {{the first two games}} in the series. The player {{controls}} the Blue tribe, pitted against the three enemy tribes which control most of the solar system. The player's destiny as Shaman <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> deity; only by defeating all the enemies in the system can the player's shaman become omnipotent. The player begins on the planet furthest from the sun, and attacks each planet in sequence. Along the way, the Shaman can learn new skills and magic to defeat her (usually) much more powerful enemies. Victory requires the player to either destroy the opposition, or on occasion perform special actions. The player loses if his or her Shaman is killed and there are no remaining followers, if the Shaman is killed and there is no circle of reincarnation, or the player runs out of time on timed levels. Upon beating back the other tribes, the Shaman ascends to godhood, and further helps her people conquer the Matak, Chumara and Dakini in one final conflict.|$|E

As with the Mahayana, motivation {{is a vital}} component of Vajrayana practice.

25|$|In 1968, Sagan {{was denied}} tenure at Harvard. He later {{indicated}} {{the decision was}} very much unexpected. The tenure denial has been blamed on several factors, including that he focused his interests too broadly across {{a number of areas}} (while the norm in academia <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> renowned expert in a narrow specialty), and perhaps because of his well-publicized scientific advocacy, which some scientists perceived as borrowing the ideas of others for little more than self-promotion. An advisor from his years as an undergraduate student, Harold Urey, {{wrote a letter to the}} tenure committee recommending strongly against tenure for Sagan.|$|E
25|$|Chibiusa {{started out}} {{socially}} awkward, she quickly became popular with her classmates. In the manga, she once {{became president of}} her class. Her initial shyness {{could be attributed to}} {{the fact that she was}} teased in the 30th-century for not having any Soldier powers. As the manga progresses, she gradually matures, becoming more comfortable with herself and more confident with her Soldier abilities. Because her dream in the manga <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> beautiful lady, her actions often are based around this. She tries to be a perfectionist and starts off trying to do everything alone and for herself. This view evolves as she realizes what maturity really is and what it really means to be an adult. In the original anime, she is more judgmental and does not mature as much as her manga counterpart. But she does in Sailor Moon Crystal and gets along better with Usagi.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2008 AIB entered the Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian markets by acquiring the AmCredit mortgage finance business from the Baltic American Enterprise Fund. Now AIB operates as a branch of this financial group in Estonia and Lithuania (update needed), operations in Latvia have ceased (see below). In 2008 AIB operated through its local branches providing financial services under established AmCredit brand in all three countries. AmCredit operated as a single product mortgage business, but the company is expanding the range of banking products. All AmCredit's mortgage customers automatically became customers of the AIB branch in their country. The goal of AIB <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> full service customer focused bank in the Baltic region. The branch in Latvia was operating between November 26, 2007 (date of registration) and September 20, 2012 (date of liquidation). Its mortgage portfolio of 800 loans was acquired by Swedbank.|$|E

25|$|The {{beginning}} of the 14th century was characterized by the civil unrest in the cities of the kingdom, most notably in Lugo, Tui, Ourense and Compostela, originated in the aspiration of their city councils to become reguengas, that <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> direct dependency of the king, and as such virtually autonomous republics {{under the direction of}} their elected councils, whilst their bishops aspired to maintain them under their jurisdictional control, as part of their fiefs. This unrest was not new, as Compostela had known bloody conflicts of the bourgeois and the bishops since {{the first years of the}} 12th century, in times of Gelmirez, when the bishop himself was chased inside the city. In these conflicts, Don Felipe and the local nobility usually supported the councils' pretensions in opposition to the mighty and rich bishops, although most of the time the military and economic relevance of the archbishop of Santiago proved determinant in the maintenance of the status quo.|$|E
25|$|A {{notice of}} Harvard {{would be as}} {{incomplete}} without {{a reference to the}} Porcellian Club as a notice of Oxford or Cambridge would be in which the Union Debating Society held no place. This and the Hasty Pudding Club, an organization for performing amateur theatricals, are the two lions of Harvard. The Porcellian Club is hardly a place of resort for those who cultivate the intellect {{at the expense of the}} body. The list of active members is small, owing in part to the largeness of the annual subscription. The great desire of every student <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> member of it... the doings of the club are shrouded in secrecy... All that can be said by a stranger who has been privileged to step behind the scenes is that the mysteries are rites which can be practised without much labor and yield a pleasure which is fraught with no unpleasant consequences.|$|E

Austen's History parodied popular historical writing, particularly Oliver Goldsmith's History of England (1764). Honan speculates that not long after writing Love and Freindship in 1789, Austen decided to [...] "write for profit, to make stories her central effort", that <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> professional writer. Beginning in about 1793, Austen began to write longer, more sophisticated works.|$|E

Kōhei meets a transfer student named Rumi Nanase early in the story whose goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> [...] "true maiden" [...] and to that end, she behaves maidenly toward those around her, but she shows her true character just to Kōhei, who leaves a terrible first impression.

He later asks guidance counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) for advice on how to cope with the possibility of walking again in light of the new research, but is disappointed when Emma tells him that such treatments may not become available for a long time. Tina continues to offer to dance with him but he declines, insisting that she choose another partner but agreeing to sing during the dance.
