5|$|Brian and Stewie {{manage to}} sneak in {{backstage}} at the concert, where Miley asks why they're here. Brian then explains that Stewie has a 'tumor' shaped like a football, which convinces Miley to let them hang out with her backstage. Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, like taking him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that he has never gave as much attention to him as the monkey has, so he grows to resent his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her. He then realises something is strange about Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a USB drive on the control panel on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can perform other tasks, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley to have sex with Brian by gaining access to the control panel. However, it goes wrong and he accidentally sends Miley into a rage, forcing Stewie and Brian to run away from the monstrous Miley.|$|E
5|$|The {{third round}} of green-flag pit stops {{commenced}} fifteen laps later when Bräck became the first driver to stop. Franchitti inherited the first position until he made his pit stop on lap 143, <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Manning. This meant Manning became the first driver to lead his début CART race twice. The fourth caution was necessitated on the 155th lap when Manning's right-hand rear wing endplate became detached and landed on the track {{between the first and}} second turns. Manning made a pit stop but his crew elected not to make repairs to his rear wing. It assisted in making his car develop less understeer and slightly improved its balance. Racing resumed on lap 163 with Bräck leading a single-file restart. The left side of Kanaan's car collided heavily with the wall on the backstraight six laps later, triggering the fifth (and final) caution. All drivers (including Bräck) made pit stops under caution. A crew member on Bräck's team dropped a left-rear wheel nut dropping him to ninth place. Fernández was observed speeding and was required to move to the rear of the field. Da Matta's team were slow to fit his right-rear tyre preventing him from taking the first position and he emerged in second place.|$|E
25|$|Allende argued he had obeyed {{constitutional}} {{means for}} including military {{men to the}} cabinet {{at the service of}} civic peace and national security, defending republican institutions against insurrection and terrorism. In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a coup d’état or a civil war with a declaration full of affirmations that had already been refuted beforehand and which, in substance and process (directly <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the ministers rather than directly <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the President) violated a dozen articles of the (then-current) Constitution. He further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive function.|$|E

25|$|In the Eastern Orthodox Church, altar servers {{assist the}} higher clergy during services. They might carry the cross, candles or liturgical fans in processions and entrances; {{maintain}} the censer, ensuring it has enough live charcoal, loading it with incense and <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the priest or deacon when required; preparing {{the hot water}} (zeon) in time {{for it to be}} added to the chalice at the Divine Liturgy; prepare the antidoron for the people to receive after Holy Communion; and any other necessary tasks so that the priest need not be distracted during the service. An altar server is vested in the sticharion only.|$|E
25|$|Hugh Joseph Tayfield (30 January 1929 – 24 February 1994) was a cricketer. He played 37 Test matches for South Africa from 1949 to 1960 {{and was one}} of {{the best}} off spinners the game has seen. He was the fastest South African to take 100 wickets in Tests (in terms of matches played) until Dale Steyn claimed the record in March 2008. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1956. He was known as 'Toey Tayfield' due to his habit of {{stubbing}} his toes into the ground before every delivery. He would also kiss the badge on his cap before <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the umpire at the start of every over.|$|E
25|$|Engel did {{not agree}} with the committee's report, which {{contained}} proposals {{for the creation of a}} committee to schedule backbench business, the establishment of a committee to set the Commons' agenda and the election of select committee chairs by secret ballot. She felt those three changes would transfer power 'from one elite—in this case, the Executive—and <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> another—a group of senior Back Benchers'. She also said they would be 'a step in the wrong direction' because they were small changes that would risk standing in the way of more sweeping reforms as MPs would essentially be telling themselves and the public 'we've done , we will move on'. Engel drafted a minority report that proposed restarting the committee's work after the 2010 election, when it would have more time to investigate and deliberate.|$|E

25|$|Yashin's {{relationship}} with the Ottawa Senators reached a new low after the 1998–99 season. Yashin refused to honour {{the final year of}} his contract and demanded a raise (he would have earned $3.6 million USD that year, compared to other star centerman like Steve Yzerman and Joe Sakic who made $6–7 million). When the Senators refused, he demanded a trade on the advice of his agent, Mark Gandler. This was the third time Yashin demanded a new contract during his five years with the team. The Senators refused to trade Yashin, instead stripping him of his captaincy and <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Daniel Alfredsson. When Yashin still refused to report, the Senators suspended him {{for the rest of the}} 1999–2000 NHL season on 10 November, with the full support of the NHL. Yashin attempted to sign with a team in Switzerland, but the International Ice Hockey Federation suspended him from playing internationally until the dispute was resolved. After the season, an NHL arbitrator refused to grant Yashin the free agent status he claimed to have earned, instead tolling his contract for another season on the grounds that Yashin owed the Senators the final year of his contract if he ever returned to the NHL. It was another public relations disaster for Yashin.|$|E
500|$|The final {{thing that}} he did {{was to create a}} {{breakdown}} using Auto-Tune and the Nord Lead synthesizer, applying its echo function. In total Ahmadzaï worked for 15days on the track, finally <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> mixing engineer Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent. He explained in an interview with Keyboard magazine that the version that he created was almost same to the final track present in Music. On most of the other tracks, Stent tried to add a lot of mixing effects to Ahmadzaï's production. But for [...] "Impressive Instant", they tried to mix it first from the Sony digital tracks and failed get the original sound of the demo, since the compression present in the track was the actual sound to be produced. So Stent took the sound from Ahmadzaï's Yamaha 02R mixer, including the bass, loops, and the kick. Along with mixing the track at Olympic Studios, London, the mastering was done by Tim Young at Metropolis Studio. Other engineers working on the track included Mark Endert, Sean Spuehler, Tom Hannen and Tim Lambert.|$|E

He advanced through the ranks, seeing action under command of Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin. Throughout his career, he demonstrated a cool head {{even in the}} heat of battle; at the Battle of Prague, he showed considerable courage in picking up the fallen regimental flag, <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a Junker to carry, and leading his regiment forward despite intensive cannon fire.|$|E
2500|$|In later works, Russian historians such as Mikhail Meltyukhov and Oleg Vishlyov {{dismiss the}} parades {{in other cities}} as [...] "a myth", {{pointing}} {{to the fact that}} virtually no evidence has been found to confirm that those parades actually took place. In Lwow, Vishlyov states, it was impossible to organize a joint parade, as the Soviet troops were ordered to move at a distance of 20 km from the Germans after an accidental exchange of fire between the two sides, and no German units were present there at the time when the city capitulated to the Soviets. Vishlyov also disputes that the events in Brest were a military parade and writes that what is often mistakenly regarded as a parade was in fact a [...] "ceremonial departure of German forces under the supervision of Soviet representatives". That is, before leaving the city and <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Soviet Union, the Germans marched through the streets greeted by their command and supervised by a Soviet military representative, whose role was to sign an agreement with the German command and monitor the implementation of that agreement. It was only after their withdrawal that the Soviet troops entered the city and held their own parade.|$|E
2500|$|According to Graham Sadler, La Bruère {{completed}} {{most of the}} libretto by October 1749. He initially {{offered it}} to Mondonville before <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Rameau in April 1750. Rameau finished the score by November and Linus went into rehearsal {{at the house of}} the Marquise de Villeroy on 10 May 1751. In Sylvie Bouissou's opinion, Rameau intended Linus as a successor to his tragédie en musique Zoroastre (1749). The revisions to the violin score suggest that the opera underwent several rehearsals. The complicated scenic effects mean it was probably destined for performance at the Paris Opéra. According to the Abbé de La Porte, the rehearsals revealed some problems with the words and music of the fifth act. Revision proved difficult as La Bruère had left for Rome; the writer Charles Collé later claimed that he wanted to take over this task. Years later, Rameau's admirer Jacques-Joseph-Marie Decroix wrote that the manuscript score was [...] "lost or stolen" [...] from the Marquise de Villeroy's house during confusion caused by an [...] "illness" [...] and only the part for the violin was left. The illness to which Decroix refers was probably Rameau's rather than Madame de Villeroy's as the composer is known to have been seriously indisposed in early 1751. Decroix suggested an alternative theory in which Rameau deliberately refused to stage Linus rather than compromise his artistic integrity: [...] "Who knows if these supposed faults [...] were not the unusual beauties of which Rameau was fond, and that the busybodies [...] who wanted to make him change them did not make him decide to suppress the whole opera? He was just the man to make such sacrifices." ...|$|E

Bowers and I went to Kaufman’s store to get the money and Van Triplett and Foster {{remained}} behind.

2500|$|Justman {{registered}} immediate {{concerns over}} the potential cost of attempting to film the treatment. He had particular concerns about a time portal effect, a scene involving a mammoth {{and the number of}} exterior and night shoots that would be required. Despite this, Roddenberry asked Ellison {{to turn it into a}} shooting script and set aside a desk for him in the assistant director's room, expecting him to attend the office every day until he finished it. Ellison ended up with a smaller office of his own at his request, but disliked it sufficiently that he spent the majority of his time on set. He would play loud rock and roll music in the office, and then leave it for the set. On one occasion story editor John D. F. Black caught him on set during the filming of [...] "Mudd's Women" [...] and had him escorted back to the office. The music went on, and Black went back to tell Ellison to turn it down, but the writer had already climbed out the window and left. But on other occasions, he would work late into the night and slept on the couch in Justman's office. As the delays added up, the slots assigned to [...] "The City on the Edge of Forever" [...] were reallocated to other episodes. Although this period was later claimed to be of various lengths, Ellison completed the first draft teleplay in three weeks, <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Justman on June 7. Black later said that Ellison always had [...] "40 things going" [...] in reference to him doing multiple assignments at once. In response, Ellison said that doing multiple assignments at the same time was simply how screenwriters earned a living in the 1960s.|$|E
