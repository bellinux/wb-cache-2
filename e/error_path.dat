40|$|Abstract. Counterexample-guided {{abstraction}} refinement (CEGAR) is {{model for}} a given system. The approach learns information from infeasible error paths in order to refine the abstract model. We {{address the problem of}} selecting which information to learn from a given infeasible <b>error</b> <b>path.</b> In previous work, we presented a method that enables refinement selection by extracting a set of sliced prefixes from a given infeasible <b>error</b> <b>path,</b> each of which represents a different reason for infeasibility of the <b>error</b> <b>path</b> and thus, a possible way to refine the abstract model. In this work, we (1) define and investigate several promising heuristics for selecting an appropriate precision for refinement, and (2) propose a new combination of a value analysis and a predicate analysis that does not only find out which information to learn from an infeasible <b>error</b> <b>path,</b> but automatically decides which analysis should be preferred for a refinement. These contributions allow a more systematic refinement strategy for CEGAR-based analyses. We evaluated the idea on software verification. We provide an implementation of the new concepts in the verification framework CPAchecker and make it publicly available. In a thorough experimental study, we show that refinement selection often avoids state-space explosion where existing approaches diverge, and that it can be even more powerful if applied on a higher level, where it decides which analysis of a combination should be favored for a refinement. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstraction is a {{successful}} technique in software verification, and interpolation on infeasible error paths is {{a successful}} approach to automatically detect the right level of abstraction in counterexample-guided abstraction refinement. Because the interpolants have a significant influence {{on the quality of}} the abstraction, and thus, the effectiveness of the verification, an algorithm for deriving the best possible interpolants is desirable. We present an analysis-independent technique that makes it possible to extract several alternative sequences of interpolants from one given infeasible <b>error</b> <b>path,</b> if there are several reasons for infeasibility in the <b>error</b> <b>path.</b> We take as input the given infeasible <b>error</b> <b>path</b> and apply a slicing technique to obtain a set of error paths that are more abstract than the original <b>error</b> <b>path</b> but still infeasible, each for a different reason. The (more abstract) constraints of the new paths can be passed to a standard interpolation engine, in order to obtain a set of interpolant sequences, one for each new path. The analysis can then choose from this set of interpolant sequences and select the most appropriate, instead of being bound to the single interpolant sequence that the interpolation engine would normally return. For example, we can select based on domain types of variables in the interpolants, prefer to avoid loop counters, or compare with templates for potential loop invariants, and thus control what kind of information occurs in the abstraction of the program. We implemented the new algorithm in the open-source verification framework CPAchecker and show that our proof-technique-independent approach yields a significant improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of the verification process.

40|$|Abstract. Automatic {{software}} verification relies on constructing, {{for a given}} program, an abstract model that is (1) abstract enough to avoid state-space explosion and (2) precise enough to reason about the spec-ification. Counterexample-guided abstraction refinement is a standard technique that suggests to extract information from infeasible error paths, in order to refine the abstract model if it is too imprecise. Existing ap-proaches —including our previous work — do not choose the refinement for a given path systematically. We present a method that generates alternative refinements and allows to systematically choose a suited one. The method takes as input one given infeasible <b>error</b> <b>path</b> and applies a than the original <b>error</b> <b>path</b> but still infeasible, each for a different reason. The (more abstract) constraints of the new paths can be passed to a stan-dard refinement procedure, {{in order to obtain}} a set of possible refinements, one for each new path. Our technique is completely independent from the abstract domain that is used in the program analysis, and does not rely on a certain proof technique, such as SMT solving. We implemented the new algorithm in the verification framework CPAchecker and made our extension publicly available. The experimental evaluation of our technique indicates that there is a wide range of possibilities on how to refine the abstract model for a given <b>error</b> <b>path,</b> and we demonstrate that the choice of which refinement to apply to the abstract model has {{a significant impact on the}} verification effectiveness and efficiency. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} active {{noise control}} (ANC) system that exploits the orthogonalization of the input narrowband noise field, both for the main path identification and the noise canceller for the <b>error</b> <b>path</b> identification, is proposed. This is achieved by a joint Laguerre lattice structure, which uses a common Laguerre lattice filter and different regression filters for the main path identification and for noise canceller for <b>error</b> <b>path</b> identification. Further, for the adaptation of both regression filters, use of the overall errors instead of individual errors (at each stage of the lattice) is suggested, as it provides better reduction in the convergence error. Compared to the existing ANC systems based on lattice structure, the proposed ANC has a significantly faster convergence rate (7 times) {{and the use of}} overall error over individual errors, provides better noise reduction. Further, the Laguerre structure used for the lattice, reduces the computational load significantly (requires only about half the normal filter length) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{optimizing}} software testing efficiency by identifying the most <b>error</b> prone <b>path</b> clusters in a program. We do this by developing variable length genetic algorithms that optimize and select the software path clusters which are weighted with sources of error indexes. Although various methods have been applied to detecting and reducing errors in a whole system, there is little research into partitioning a system into smaller error prone domains for testing. Exhaustive software testing is rarely possible because it becomes intractable for even medium sized software. Typically only parts of a program can be tested, but these parts {{are not necessarily the}} most error prone. Therefore, we are developing a more selective approach to testing by focusing on those parts that are most likely to contain faults, so that the most <b>error</b> prone <b>paths</b> can be tested first.

40|$|Interference among {{different}} wireless hosts {{is becoming a}} serious issue due to {{the growing number of}} Wireless LANs based on the popular IEEE 802. 11 standard. Thus, an accurate modeling of <b>error</b> <b>paths</b> at the data link layer is indispensable for evaluating system performance and for tuning and optimizing protocols at higher layers. <b>Error</b> <b>paths</b> are usually described looking at sequences of consecutive correct or erroneous frames and at the distributions of their sizes. In recent years, a number of Markovbased stochastic models have been proposed in order to statistically characterize these distributions. Nevertheless, when applied to analyze the data traces we collected, they exhibit several flaws. In this paper, to overcome these model limitations, we propose a new algorithm based on a semi-Markov process, where each state characterizes a different error pattern. The model has been validated by using measures from a real environment. Moreover, we have compared our method with other promising models already available in literature. Numerical results show that our proposal performs better than the other models in capturing the long-term temporal correlation of real measured traces. At the same time, it is able to estimate first order statistics with the same accuracy of the other models, but with a minor computational complexity.

The abstractions, and thus the heuristic functions, are generated fully automatically and do not need any additional user input.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [63]- 65) Active noise cancellation is a {{new technology}} for noise control. It reduces the unwanted noise by generating another out-of-phase noise so that the two result in destructive interference. Because of {{the changing nature of}} noise signals and environment, sophisticated adaptive signal processing techniques have to be used to achieve good results. High speed digital signal processors are also required to implement these complicated algorithms. A particularly difficult problem in the commonly used active noise cancellation configuration is the on-line system identification of the auxiliary path and <b>error</b> <b>path,</b> required for the proper convergence of the LMS algorithm for noise cancellation.

The thesis begins by briefly describing the acoustic environment (a cylindrical duct) in which the system works. After that, the APNC System itself is described in detail with various simulations to illustrate the behavior of the same. Various alternatives for the system are explored, between them the use (or not) of compensation for the <b>error</b> <b>path</b> and the type of compensation that should be used (FIR or HR filter). A new on-line modelling algorithm is also derived, and its effectiveness in modelling the <b>error</b> <b>path</b> is investigated. The behavior of the system for a sweep in frequency is also analyzed. The thesis also describes a graphical approach to a stability analysis of the APNC system. Through this stability analysis is not only demonstrated the effects of the compensation for the <b>error</b> <b>path</b> in the stability of the system, but also the effects of the step size p and system order N in the stability of the system. The implementation of the APNC system in real time is also discussed. Matters of practical consideration (like inversion of the error signal for use in the LMS algorithm and error averaging) constitute the main focus of this section of the thesis. Performance of the real-time compensated system and uncompensated system are compared and analyzed. It is also demonstrated that the real time compensated system presents a reasonable overall cancellation for the spectrum of frequencies in which it works. The thesis is concluded by a brief assessment of the material included in the same. It is deliberated that the new on-line modelling technique and the graphical stability analysis are two of the main contributions of the thesis. It is also deliberated that the APNC system in question is inherently more stable than other active noise control systems that use an input microphone. It is also mentioned that, due to the small number of computations required by the APNC system, it can be implemented in a more inexpensive chip, therefore yielding a cheaper active noise control system.

40|$|Abstract—A 65 nm {{resilient}} circuit test-chip {{is implemented}} with timing-error detection and recovery circuits {{to eliminate the}} clock frequency guardband from dynamic supply voltage and temperature variations {{as well as to}} exploit path-activation probabilities for maximizing throughput. Two error-detection se-quential (EDS) circuits are introduced to preserve the timing-error detection capability of previous EDS designs while lowering clock energy and removing datapath metastability. One EDS circuit is a dynamic transition detector with a time-borrowing datapath latch (TDTB). The other EDS circuit is a double-sampling static design with a time-borrowing datapath latch (DSTB). In comparison to previous EDS designs, TDTB and DSTB redirect the highly com-plex metastability problem from both the datapath and <b>error</b> <b>path</b> to only the <b>error</b> <b>path,</b> enabling a drastic simplification in man-aging metastability. From a survey of various EDS circuit options, TDTB represents the lowest clock energy EDS circuit known; DSTB represents the lowest clock energy static-EDS circuit with SER protection known. Error-recovery circuits are introduced to replay failing instructions at lower clock frequency to guarantee correct functionality. Relative to conventional circuits, test-chip measurements demonstrate that resilient circuits enable either 25 %– 32 % throughput gain at equal or at least 17 % reduction at equal throughput, corresponding to 31 %– 37 % total power reduction.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} understood that a verification tool {{should provide a}} counterexample to witness a specification violation. Until recently, software verifiers dumped error witnesses in proprietary formats, which are often neither human- nor machine-readable, and an exchange of witnesses between dif-ferent verifiers was impossible. To close this gap in software-verification technology, we have defined an exchange format for error witnesses that is easy to write and read by verifica-tion tools (for further processing, e. g., witness validation) and that is easy to convert into visualizations that conveniently let developers inspect an <b>error</b> <b>path.</b> To eliminate manual inspection of false alarms, we develop the notion of stepwise testification: in a first step, a verifier finds a problematic pro-gram path and, {{in addition to the}} verification result false, constructs a witness for this path; in the next step, another verifier re-verifies that the witness indeed violates the speci-fication. This process can have more than two steps, each reducing the state space around the <b>error</b> <b>path,</b> making it easier to validate the witness in a later step. An obvious application for testification is the setting where we have two verifiers: one that is efficient but imprecise and another one that is precise but expensive.
