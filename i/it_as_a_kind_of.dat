25|$|This means, essentially, that {{substance}} is just whatever {{can be thought}} of without relating it to any other idea or thing. For example, if one thinks of a particular object, one thinks of <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing, e.g., x is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding it as a particular kind of thing (because it isn't a particular thing at all).|$|E
25|$|The {{accepted}} {{theory of}} {{heat in the}} 18th century viewed <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> fluid, called caloric; although this theory was later shown to be erroneous, a number of scientists adhering to it nevertheless made important discoveries useful in developing the modern theory, including Joseph Black (1728–99) and Henry Cavendish (1731–1810). Opposed to this caloric theory, which had been developed mainly by the chemists, was the less accepted theory dating from Newton's time that heat {{is due to the}} motions of the particles of a substance. This mechanical theory gained support in 1798 from the cannon-boring experiments of Count Rumford (Benjamin Thompson), who found a direct relationship between heat and mechanical energy.|$|E

50|$|Members of Falungong in an Autocratic Society 2000: Dai Qing {{contended that}} China was still {{based on the}} mode of {{collective}} idea of the previous era. While the members of Falungong gathered together to cultivate their own ideas and worshipped their own god, the Chinese government saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>a</b> deviation. She criticized the Chinese government for deploying the usual tactics of suppression to crush against Falungong members.

500|$|Similarities {{between the}} Battle of Thermopylae and the Battle of Persian Gate have been {{recognized}} by both ancient and modern authors, which describe <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> reversal of the Battle of Thermopylae, calling it [...] "the Persian Thermopylae". Here, on Alexander the Great's campaign against Persia in 330 BC to exact revenge for the Persian invasion of Greece, he faced the same situation, encountering a last stand of the Persian forces (under Ariobarzanes) at a narrow pass near Persepolis who held the invaders for a month, until their fall as the enemy found a path to their rear. There are even accounts that a local shepherd informed Alexander's forces about the secret path, just as a local Greek showed the Persian forces a secret path around the pass at Thermopylae.|$|E
500|$|In 1910, more partial fossils were {{discovered}} in Dera Bugti during an expedition by the British palaeontologist Clive Forster-Cooper. Based on these remains, Foster-Cooper moved A. bugtiense to the new genus Paraceratherium, meaning [...] "near the hornless beast", in reference to Aceratherium. His rationale for this reclassification was the species' distinctly down-turned lower tusks. In 1913, Forster-Cooper named a new genus and species, Thaumastotherium ("wonderful beast") osborni, based on larger fossils from the same excavations, but he renamed the genus Baluchitherium later that year because the former name was preoccupied, as {{it had already been}} used for a hemipteran insect. The fossils of Baluchitherium were so fragmentary that Foster-Cooper was only able to identify <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> odd-toed ungulate, but he mentioned the possibility of confusion with Paraceratherium. The American palaeontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, after which B. osborni was named, suggested {{it may have been a}} titanothere.|$|E
2500|$|Hurston later used Eatonville as a {{backdrop}} in her stories. It {{was a place where}} African Americans could live as they desired, independent of white society. In 1901, some northern schoolteachers visited Eatonville and gave Hurston a number of books that opened her mind to literature; she described <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> [...] "birth".

2500|$|At {{the script}} {{phase of the}} {{censorship}} process, the censors demanded that the character of Aunt Masa, who at one point finds a lost change purse {{on the ground and}} keeps <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> good-luck charm, should be shown handing over the purse to the police. Ozu responded by turning the situation, in the finished film, into a kind of running gag in which Shukichi repeatedly (and futilely) urges his sister to turn the purse in to the police. This change has been called [...] "a mocking kind of partial compliance with the censorship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another popular {{theory is}} that the {{outbreaks}} were all staged, and the appearance of strange behaviour was due to its unfamiliarity. Religious cults may have been acting out well-organised dances, in accordance with ancient Greek and Roman rituals. Despite being banned at the time, these rituals could be performed under the guise of uncontrollable dancing mania. Justus Hecker, a 19th-century medical writer, described <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> festival, where a practice known as [...] "the kindling of the Nodfyr" [...] was carried out. This involved jumping through fire and smoke, in an attempt to ward off disease. Bartholomew notes how participants in this ritual would often continue to jump and leap long after the flames had gone.|$|E

2500|$|The palaces {{and noble}} {{home of the}} Aztecs had ornate furniture. Entire pieces of {{hardwoods}} would be carved into benches and tables, and other items. Furniture was inlaid with gold and some covered in animal skins. [...] A kind of shellac or lacquer existed in pre-Hispanic Mexico and was used in many ceramics. The Mendocino Codex mentions <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> waterproof oil extracted from a worm called “axe” and mixed with oil from the prickly poppy seed or Mexican sage seed and pigments, {{which resulted in a}} paint. After the Conquest, the Spanish demanded European style furniture, which was usually made by indigenous craftsmen. As colonial Mexico was Spain’s gateway to Asia, oriental techniques such as parquetry and other types of inlay became common as well. The state of Michoacán is a major producer of handcrafted furniture, which can be simply varnished or stained or painted in bright colors.|$|E

2500|$|Malthus's essay calculates {{from the}} birth rate that human {{population}} could double every 25 years, {{but in practice}} growth is kept in check by death, disease, wars and famine. Darwin was well prepared to see at once that this related to de Candolle's concept of [...] "nature's war" [...] and also applies to the struggle for existence amongst wildlife, so that when there is more population than resources can maintain, favourable variations that allow the organism to better use the limited resources available tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones destroyed by being unable to get the means for existence, resulting {{in the formation of}} new species. On 28 September 1838 he noted this insight, describing <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> wedging, forcing adapted structures into gaps in the economy of nature formed as weaker ones were thrust out. He now had a theory by which to work.|$|E

2500|$|Scruton {{writes that}} Franz Brentano reintroduced {{the concept of}} {{intentionality}} into the philosophy of mind, but remarks that the intentionality passage of Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint is both obscure and hesitant. Scruton believes that the obscurity of the passage is [...] "compounded by Brentano's description of intentionality as the mark which distinguishes mental phenomena from physical phenomena, the latter being described, not as objective features of the natural world, but as appearances." [...] According to Scruton, while in later editions of Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint Brentano described intentionality as a property of mental activity, and characterized <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> [...] "mental reference", Brentano never makes clear precisely what kind of property he believes it to be anywhere in his writings. Scruton calls the chapter on [...] "The Body in its Sexual Being" [...] in Maurice Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception (1945) [...] "surprisingly unhelpful".|$|E
2500|$|Mbeki has {{sometimes}} been characterised as remote and academic, although in his second campaign for the Presidency in 2004, many observers described him as finally relaxing into more traditional ways of campaigning, sometimes dancing at events and even kissing babies. [...] Mbeki used his weekly column in the ANC newsletter ANC Today, to produce discussions {{on a variety of}} topics. He sometimes used his column to deliver pointed invectives against political opponents, and at other times used <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> professor of political theory, educating ANC cadres on the intellectual justifications for African National Congress policy. Although these columns were remarkable for their dense prose, they often were used to influence news. Although Mbeki did not generally make a point of befriending or courting reporters, his columns and news events often yielded good results for his administration by ensuring that his message is a primary driving force of news coverage.|$|E
2500|$|Following twentieth-century {{developments}} in mathematical analysis and differential geometry, {{it became clear}} that the notion of the differential of a function could be extended in a variety of ways. [...] In real analysis, it is more desirable to deal directly with the differential as the principal part of the increment of a function. [...] This leads directly to the notion that the differential of a function at a point is a linear functional of an increment Δx. [...] This approach allows the differential (as a linear map) to be developed for a variety of more sophisticated spaces, ultimately giving rise to such notions as the Fréchet or Gâteaux derivative. [...] Likewise, in differential geometry, the differential of a function at a point is a linear function of a tangent vector (an [...] "infinitely small displacement"), which exhibits <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> one-form: the exterior derivative of the function. [...] In non-standard calculus, differentials are regarded as infinitesimals, which can themselves be put on a rigorous footing (see differential (infinitesimal)).|$|E
