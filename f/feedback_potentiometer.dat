40|$|During the James Cook Cruise 27 Autosub 6000 aborted mission 12 due to {{a failure}} in the {{position}} <b>feedback</b> <b>potentiometer</b> of the stern plane actuator. The same actuator is used on Autosub 3 which is heading to the Pine Island glacier in Antarctica in January 2009. A similar failure of the Autosub 3 actuator while under the ice {{would result in the}} loss of the AUV. This report initially describes the investigation into the failure of the <b>feedback</b> <b>potentiometer</b> and shows that the potentiometer’s conductive plastic track became detached from its ceramic substrate and broke up. The report then describes the testing performed to evaluate the reliability of the potentiometer. This involved an accelerated aging test to simulate the worst case conditions seen by the potentiometer in the actuator. This was achieved by oscillating the potentiometer at 4 Hz to simulate the actuator movements whilst cycling the pressure of the Morlina 10 oil surrounding the potentiometers. During the testing the 10 k? potentiometers used in the actuator were not available, and so 5 k? potentiometers from the same range were tested as a substitute. It was assumed that these 5 k? potentiometers would produce similar results, however it was found during the testing that the formulation of the 5 k? potentiometer track was different from the 10 k?; whether this affects the reliability is not known. Due to the large amount of time required to perform each test only 16 5 k? potentiometers were tested. Although no failures occurred, the sample was too small to give a high statistical confidence that the potentiometers would survive the cruise. To further reduce the risk four 5 k? potentiometers that were to be used on Autosub 3 were tested for approximately 72 hours in a ‘burnt in’ process. As an early failure similar to that of Autosub 6000 potentiometer would have been detected during this process, the chance of the potentiometers failing was significantly reduced. Thus the burnt in potentiometers were considered acceptable for use on Autosub 3 during the Pine Island campaign...|$|E
40|$|A load {{positioning}} system with gravity compensation has a servomotor, position sensing <b>feedback</b> <b>potentiometer</b> and velocity sensing tachometer {{in a conventional}} closed loop servo arrangement to cause a lead screw and a ball nut to vertically position a load. Gravity compensating components comprise the DC motor, gears, which couple torque from the motor to the lead screw, and constant current power supply. The constant weight of the load applied to the lead screw via the ball nut tend to cause the lead screw to rotate, the constant torque of which is opposed by the constant torque produced by the motor when fed from the constant current source. The constant current is preset {{as required by the}} potentiometer to effect equilibration of the load which thereby enables the positioning servomotor to see the load as weightless under both static and dynamic conditions. Positioning acceleration and velocity performance are therefore symmetrical...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to {{document}} the design and testing of various components {{for use in a}} low cost laser cutting mechanism for hobbyists and recreational designers. Different electronics were used to assess the cutting potential of a laser diode, a small silicon chip based laser light producing unit. A test rig was constructed to evaluate the cutting potential of the laser diode, and several tests were conducted on different materials. In addition, a low cost positioning machine design was also explored, which used servo motor actuators to drive the system and was used to evaluate the potential of using a <b>potentiometer</b> for position <b>feedback.</b> Tests with the laser diode using different cutting strategies revealed that the cutting potential of the diode is limited and not likely well suited for cutting through materials of useful structural thickness (0. 125 inch to 0. 25 inch thick materials). The tests of the <b>potentiometer</b> <b>feedback</b> were positive, indicating that <b>potentiometer</b> <b>feedback</b> is a good method for low cost position control. However, the mechanical designs tested proved insufficient for positioning the system to within 0. 01 inches of the commanded coordinates so further improvement is necessary. by Joshua D. Ramos.
