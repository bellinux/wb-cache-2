Many of the elementary molecules in the atmosphere interact with infrared radiation through their ability to absorb and emit energy in vibrational and rotational transitions. A large variety of methods for monitoring of molecules and aerosol particles by collecting samples or by using remote sensing methods are available. The objective of this thesis work was to develop infrared spectroscopic techniques to further enhance the amount of useful information obtained from gathering spectral data. A new method for visualization and quantification of gas flows based on gas-correlation techniques was developed. Real-time imaging of gas leaks and incomplete or erratic <b>flare</b> <b>combustion</b> of ethene was demonstrated. The method relies on the thermal background as a radiation source and the gas can be visualized in absorption or in emission depending on the temperature difference. Diode laser spectroscopy was utilized to monitor three molecular species {{at the same time}} and over the same path. Two near-infrared diode lasers beams were combined in a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal and by difference-frequency generation a third beam was created, enabling simultaneous monitoring of oxygen, water vapor and methane. Models of aerosol particle cross sections were used to simulate the diffraction pattern of light scattered by fibers, spherical particles and real particles, such as pollen, through a new aerosol particle sensing prototype. The instrument, using a coupled cavity diode laser, has been designed with a ray-tracing program and the final prototype was employed for single aerosol particle sizing and identification...|$|E

This study presents material balance equations and predicts results for non-hydrocarbon emissions such as CO 2, CO, NO, NO 2, and SO 2 etc. from <b>flaring</b> (<b>combustion)</b> of 12 natural gas samples representing composition of natural gas of global origin. Gaseous emission estimates and pattern were modelled by coding material balance equations for six reaction types and combustion conditions with a computer program. On the average, anticipated gaseous emissions from flaring natural gas with an average annual global flaring rate 126 bcm per year (between 2000 and 2011) in million metric tonnes (mmt) are 560 mmt, 48 mmt, 91 mmt, 93 mmt and 50 mmt for CO 2, CO, NO, NO 2 and SO 2 respectively.

In particular, methane {{and carbon dioxide}} emissions occur in landfills due to the breakdown of biodegradable carbon compounds operated on by anaerobic bacteria. The conventional possibilities of reducing the greenhouse effect (GHE) from waste landfilling consists in landfill gas (LFG) <b>flaring</b> or <b>combustion</b> with energy recovery in reciprocating engines.

40|$|Methane is {{produced}} in landfills through the anaerobic digestion of organic material. Methane is a greenhouse gas with 24. 5 times the global warming potential when compared to carbon dioxide (CO 2). Landfill gas also contains hydrogen sulfide which may account for up to 1 percent by volume of landfill gas emissions and impacts human health even in low concentrations. As a result, landfill gas is typically collected and either flared (to convert methane and hydrogen sulphide to carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide respectively) or used for power on site. Flaring is typically an incomplete combustion process, producing many other pollutants that may result in environmental and human health impacts. Quantifying these emissions would result in better flare designs and plume dispersion estimates. However, the efficiency of <b>flare</b> <b>combustion</b> is site and flare design specific, making predictions difficult. In this work a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFDs) model (using Fluent as a tool) was developed to simulate the flow and combustion mechanisms of the flare. The model {{can be used as}} a tool in flare design and as a method to ensure an operating flare is working properly. It can also be used to predict dispersed gases concentrations, allowing operators to optimize environmental monitoring stations and flare operations. The model is a function of the input data and therefore critical parameters such as exit gas velocities, stack height and diameter among other parameters must be specified. The model was validated using lab data from published work. A risk assessment model is proposed as part of this work which integrates the CFD model with a risk model...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} flaring {{efficiency}} at the Borealis low-pressure plant in Stenungsund was conducted {{using a new}} patented method called Solar Occultation Flux (SOF), in combination with {{a new type of}} direct measurement of flow rate and ethylene concentration in the flare stack. The SOF method is based on the measurement of hydrocarbon concentrations over a cross-section of the emission plume. Multiplied by wind speed, this gives the flux of gas through the cross-section, i. e., the source emission in kg·s- 1. In the measurements, the sun was used as the light source. An infrared FTIR spectrometer linked to a sun tracker was placed on top of a van that was driven {{in such a way that}} the sunlight shone through a cross-section of the plume being measured. From the size of the molecular fingerprints in the infrared solar spectra, the concentration of ethylene and other constituents can be calculated. The results show that the flare we studied has a good combustion efficiency of about 98 % at high loads (> 1100 kg·h - 1), but that at low loads, which are the normal operating conditions most of the time, it has a significantly lower efficiency (50 - 90 %). Emissions thus appear to vary between 20 and 50 kg/h irrespective of load – a result that is consistent with other long-term FTIR measurements taken outside the plant. Similar emission results were also obtained during the course of the project from a newly installed flare, so that the problem does not appear to be specific to the flare that we studied. From the measurements in this study it can be concluded that a major contributing factor in the poor efficiency is an overdose of steam at low operating loads, as a result of trying to avoid soot formation by optimizing <b>flare</b> <b>combustion</b> at high loads. The problem can presumably be solved by introducing some form of dynamic steam metering linked to combustion load, or by eliminating the presence of ethylene at low operating loads. The direct flare stack measurements show that the heating value is generally low, and that theoretically we could therefore expect poorer efficiency levels. It was not possible to demonstrate this unambiguously in the present study, however, since the steam and ethylene levels were generally covariant. Only in a few cases did we find a low efficiency at low ethylene concentration, independent of steam quantity...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScIng) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2003. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: It {{was shown}} in an earlier study that it is {{possible}} to predict the spectral radiance of rocket combustion plumes directly from the propellant composition and motor parameters. Little is published in the open literature on this subject, but the current trend is to use determinative methods like computational fluid dynamics and statistical techniques to simulate wide band radiance based on blackbody temperature assumptions. A limitation of these methods is the fact that they are computationally expensive and rather complex to implement. An alternative modeling approach was used which did not rely on solving all the nonlinearities and complex relationships applicable to a fundamental model. A multilayer perceptron based Neural Network was used to develop a parametric functional mapping between the propellant chemical composition and the motor design and the resulting spectral irradiance measured in a section of the plume. This functional mapping effectively models the relationship between the rocket design and the plume spectral radiance. Two datasets were available for use in this study: Emission spectra from solid propellant rockets and flare emission spectra. In the case of the solid rocket propellants, the input to the network consisted of the chemical composition of the fuels and four motor parameters, with the output of the network consisting of 146 scaled emission spectra points in the waveband from 2 - 5 microns. The four motor parameters were derived from equations describing the mass flow characteristics of rocket motors. The mass flow through the rocket motor does have an effect on the shape of the plume of combustion gases, which in turn has an effect on the infrared signature of the plume. The characteristics of the mass flow through the nozzle of the rocket motor determine the thermodynamic properties of the combustion process. This then influences the kind of chemical species found in the plume and also at what temperature these species are radiating energy. The resultant function describing the plume signature is: Plume signature f {p T A fuel composition} t,,,, 1 1 = ε It was demonstrated that this approach yielded very useful results. Using only 18 basic variables, the spectra were predicted properly for variations in all these parameters. The model also predicted spectra that agree with the underlying physical situation when changing the composition as a whole. By decreasing the Potassium content for example, the model demonstrated the effect of a flame suppressant on the radiance in this wavelength band by increasing the predicted output. Lowering the temperature, which drives the process of molecular vibration and translation, resulted in the expected lower output across the spectral band. In general, it was shown that only a small section of the large space of 2 propellant classes had to be measured in order to successfully generate a model that could predict emission spectra for other designs in those classes. The same principal was then applied to predicting the infrared spectral emission of a burning flare. The brick type flare considered in this study will ignite and the solid fuel will burn on all surfaces. Since there are no physical parameters influencing the plume as in the case of the rocket nozzles it was required to search for parameters that could influence the flare plume. It was possible to calculate thermodynamic properties for the <b>flare</b> <b>combustion</b> process. These parameters were then reduced to 4 parameters, namely: the oxidant-fuel ratio, equilibrium temperature, the molar mass and the maximum combustion temperature. The input variables for the flares thus consisted of the chemical composition and 4 thermodynamic parameters described above. The network proposed previously was improved and optimised for a minimum number of variables in the system. The optimised network marginally improved on the pevious results (with the same data), but the training time involved was cut substantially. The same approach to the optimization of the network was again followed to determine the optimal network structure for predicting the flare emission spectra. The optimisation involved starting out with the simplest possible network construction and continuouslyincreasing the variables in the system until the solution predicted by the network was satisfactory. Once the structure of the network was determined it was possible to optimise the training algorithms to further improve the solution. In the case of the solid rocket propellant emission data it was felt that it would be important to be able to predict the chemical composition of the fuel and the motor parameters using the infrared emission spectra as input. This was done by simply reversing the optimised network and exchanging the inputs with the outputs. The results obtained from the reversed network accurately predicted the chemical composition and motor parameters on two different test sets. The predicted spectra of some of the solid propellant rocket test sets and flare test sets did not compare well with the expected values. This was due to the fact that these test sets were in a sparsely populated area of the variable space. These outliers are normally removed from training data, but in this case there wasn’t enough data to remove outliers. To obtain an indication of the strength of the correlation between the predicted and measured line spectra two parameters were used to test the correlation between two line spectra. The first parameter is the Pearson product moment of coefficient of correlation and gives an indication of how good the predicted line spectra followed the trend of the measured spectral lines. The second parameter measures the relative distance between a target and predicted spectral point. For both the solid propellants and the flares the correlation values was very close to 1, indicating a very good solution. Values for the two correlation parameters of a test set of the flares were 0. 998 and 0. 992. In order to verify the model it was necessary to prove that the solution yielded by the model is better than the average of the variable space. Three statistical tests were done consisting of the mean-squared-error test, T-test and Wilcoxon ranksum test. In all three cases the average of the variable space (static model) and the predicted values (Neural Network model) were compared to the measured values. For both the T-test and the Wilcoxon ranksum test the null hypothesis is rejected when t < -tα = 1. 645 and then thealternative hypothesis is accepted, which states that the error of the NN model will be smaller than that of the static model. The mean squared error for the static model was 0. 102 compared to the 0. 0167 of the neural net, for a solid propellant rocket test set. A ttest was done on the same test set, yielding a value of – 2. 71, which is smaller than – 1. 645, indicating that the NN model outperforms the static model. The Z value for this test set is Z = - 11. 9886, which is a much smaller than – 1. 645. The results from these statistical tests confirm that neural network is a valid conceptual model and the solutions yielded are unique. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: In ‘n vroeër studie is bewys hoe dit moontlik is om die spektrale irradiansie van ‘n vuurpyl se verbrandingspluim te voorspel vanaf slegs die dryfmiddelsamestelling en vuurpylmotoreienskappe. In die literatuur is daar min gepubliseer oor hierdie onderwerp. Dit wil voorkom asof meer deterministiese metodes gebruik word om die probleem op te los. Metodes soos CFD simulasies en statistiese analises word tans verkies om wyeband radiansie te voorspel gebaseer op perfekte swart ligaam teorie. ‘n Groot beperking van hierdie metodes is die feit dat die berekeninge kompleks is en baie lank neem om te voltooi. ‘n Alternatiewe benadering is gebruik, wat nie poog om al die nie-liniêre en komplekse verbande uit eerste beginsels op te los nie. ‘n Neurale netwerk is gebruik om ‘n funksionele verband te skep tussen die chemiese samestelling van die dryfmiddel, vuurpylmotor ontwerp en die spektrale irradiansie van die vuurpyl se pluim. Die funksionele verband kan nou effektief die afhanklikheid van die dryfmiddelsamestelling, vuurpylmotor ontwerp en die spektrale uitset modelleer. Twee datastelle was beskikbaar vir analise: Emissie spektra van vaste dryfmiddel vuurpyle en ook van vaste dryfmiddel fakkels. Die invoer tot die neurale netwerk van die vuurpyle het bestaan uit die chemiese samestelling van die dryfmiddel en 4 vuurpylmotor eienskappe. Die uitvoer van die netwerk het weer bestaan uit 146 spektrale irradiansie waardes in die golflengte band van 2 - 5 μm. Die 4 vuurpylmotor eienskappe is afgelei uit massavloei teorie vir vuurpyl motors, aangesien die uitvloei van die produkgasse ‘n invloed op die pluim van die motor sal hê. Die massavloei het weer ‘n effek op die spektrale handtekening van die pluim. Die eienskappe van die massavloei deur die mondstuk van die vuurpylmotor bepaal die termodinamiese eienskappe van die verbrandingsproses. Die invloed op die verbrandingsproses bepaal weer watter tipe produkte gevorm word en by watter temperatuur hulle energie uitstraal. Die gevolg is dat ‘n funksie gedefinieer kan word wat die pluim beskryf. Pluim handtekening = f{, temperatuur, mondstuk keël grootte, vernouings verhouding van mondstuk, dryfmiddelsamestelling} Deur net 18 invoer nodes te gebruik kon die netwerk die irradiansie suksesvol voorspel met ‘n variansie in al die invoer waardes. Deur byvoorbeeld die Kalium inhoud van die dryfmiddel samestelling te verminder het die model die vermindering van ‘n vlam onderdrukker suksesvol nageboots deurdat die irradiansie ‘n hoër uitset gehad het. Die sensitiwiteit van die model is verder getoets deur die temperatuur in die verbrandingskamer te verlaag, met ‘n korrekte laer irradiansie uitset, as gevolg van die feit dat die temperatuur die molekulêre vibrasie en translasie beweging beheer. Dieselfde benadering is gebruik om die model te bou vir die voorspelling van die fakkels se infrarooi irradiansie. Anders as die vuurpylmotors vind die verbranding in die geval van die fakkels in die atmosfeer plaas. Dit was dus ook nodig om na die termodinamiese eienskappe van die fakkel verbranding te kyk. Verskeie parameters is bereken, maar 4 parameters, naamlik die brandstof-suurstof verhouding, temperatuur, molêre massa en die maksimum verbrandingstemperatuur, tesame met die dryfmiddel samestelling kon die irradiansie van die fakkels suskesvol voorspel. Die bestaande netwerk struktuur vir die vuurpylmotors is verbeter en geoptimiseer vir ‘n minimum hoeveelheid veranderlikes in die stelsel. Die geoptimiseerde netwerk het ‘n klein verbetering in die voorspellings getoon, maar die oplei het drasties afgeneem. Dieselfde benadering is gebruik om die optimale netwerk vir die fakkels te bepaal. Optimisering van die netwerk struktuur is bereik deur met die eenvoudigste struktuur te begin en die hoeveelheid veranderlikes te vermeerder totdat ‘n bevredigende oplossing gevind is. Na die struktuur van die netwerk bevestig is, kon die oordragfunksies op die nodes verder geoptimiseer word om die model verder te verbeter. Dit het verder geblyk dat dit moonlik is om die netwerk vir die vuurpylmotors om te draai sodat die irradiansie gebruik word om die dryfmiddel samestelling en motor eienskappe te voorspel. Die netwerk is eenvoudig omgedraai en die insette het die uitsette geword. Die resultate van die omgekeerde netwerk het bevestig dat dit wel moontlik is om die dryfmiddel samestelling en motor eienskappe te voorspel vanaf die irradiansie. Die voorspelde spektra van beide die vuurpylmotors en die fakkels het nie altyd goed gekorreleer met die gemete data nie. Van die spektra kom voor in ‘n lae digtheidsdeel van die veranderlike ruimte. Dit het tot gevolg gehad dat daar nie genoeg data vir opleiding van die netwerk in die omgewing van die toetsdata was nie. Hierdie data is eintlik uitlopers en moet verwyder word van die opleidingsdata, maar daar is alreeds nie genoeg data beskikbaar om die uitlopers te verwyder nie. Dit is nodig om te bepaal hoe goed die voorspelde data vergelyk met die gemete data. Twee parameters is gebruik om te bepaal hoe goed die data korreleer. Die eerste is die “Pearson product moment of coefficient of correlation”, wat ‘n goeie aanduiding gee van hoe goed die voorspelde waardes die gemete waardes se profiel volg. Die tweede parameter meet die relatiewe afstand tussen die teiken en die voorspelde waardes. Vir beide die vuurpylmotors en die fakkels het die toetsstelle ‘n korrelasiewaarde van baie na aan 1 gegee, wat ‘n goeie korrelasie is. Die waardes van die twee parameters vir een van die fakkel toetstelle was onderskeidelik 0. 998 en 0. 992. Die model is geverifieer deur te bepaal of die model ‘n beter oplossing bied as die gemiddeld van die veranderlike ruimte. Drie statistiese toetse is gedoen: “Mean-squarederror” toets, T-toets en ‘n “Wilcoxon ranksum” toets. In al drie gevalle word die gemiddelde van die veranderlike ruimte (statiese model) en die voorspelde waardes (Neurale netwerk model) teen die gemete waardes getoets. Vir beide die T-toets en die “Wilcoxon ranksum” toets word die nul hipotese verwerp indien t < ta = 1. 645 en dan word die alternatiewe hipotese aanvaar, wat bepaal dat die fout van die neurale netwerk model kleiner is as die van die statiese model. Die “mean-squared-error” van die statiese model was 0. 102, in vergelyking met 0. 0167 van die neurale netwerk model vir ‘n vuurpylmotor toetsstel. ‘n T-toets is gedoen vir dieselfde toetsstel, met ‘n resultaat van- 2. 71, wat kleiner is as – 1. 645 en aandui dat die neurale netwerk model weereens beter presteer as die statiese model. Die Z waarde uit die “Wilcoxon ranksum” toets is Z=- 11. 9886, wat baie kleiner is as – 1. 645. Die resultate van die statitiese toetse toon dat die neurale netwerk ‘n geldige model is en die oplossings van die model ook uniek is...|$|E

40|$|Smoking flares {{have always}} {{represented}} the visible symbols of pollution escaping from the world's oil and petrochemical industries. Only in recent years, however, has the increasing size of such complexes begun to cause acute environmental problems. During normal operations, these valuable off-gases {{ought to be}} conserved, either by gas liquifaction or by re-injection plants but, in an emergency, flares remain necessities as 'plant safety valves'. Essentially, smokeless flaring is an aerodynamic mixing problem. The large volume air requirement for clean combustion has to be induced into the flame by some kind of high pressure gas or steam entrainment system. A novel method of effecting this mixing, rapidly, is to utilise the 'Coanda Effect'. This is the name given to the tendency of a fluid jet to adhere to an adjacent surface, thereby causing enhanced entrainment, actually up to 25 times the original air inflow into the jet. The object {{of this research was}} to study and thus improve the performance of one design of Coanda, external surface, steam flare, developed and marketed by BP under the trade name Stedair. The investigation of this flare system was conducted in two parts; physical modelling of the entrainment at the flare tip, followed on by confirmatory measurements, on a 76 mm pilot scale, propylene doped, methane-steam flare, A slice (two-dimensional) water model of a Stedair flare tip was constructed, to examine the effectiveness of Coanda surface geometry, as an entrainer and mixer. The neutralisation reaction between solutions of HCl and NaOH was used to imitate the combustion reactions between oxygen and hydrocarbons, the neutralisation being made visible by the use of phenolphalcin as an indicator. Adjustment of the concentrations cuid flows simulates fuel stoichiemetry and excess air requirements, producing a 'flare envelope' corresponding to the 'mixed is burnt criterion. The second phase of the investigation consisted of a series of combustion tests on the largest (76 mm) Stedair steam flare that could b 6 safely operated within a high ceiling (7. 6 m) laboratory. Temperature and CO profiles within the flame were measured on 3 flare heads, with 4 slot widths/head and at 3 steam flows/slot width, the gas flow being kept constant. Smoke Points, Blow-off and Coanda Breakaway Points were also measured at varying gas flows. The Coanda principle is inherently such an excellent entrainment device that <b>combustion</b> on these <b>flare</b> tips is nearly always good, provided that the jet slot width remains uniform. Whilst noise and radiation levels can only be measured on real <b>flares,</b> <b>combustion</b> quality and entrainment rates are best measured on slice water models of such flares. The experimental flare built by the author demonstrated this point very well. The pulsations and oscillations of this turbulent jet, even in the wind-free laboratory environment made obtaining consistent measurements very difficult. A Coanda flare behaves like an enclosed rather than a free jet, thus the similarity criteria developed by Craya and Curtet can be applied and when it is, Jenkins and Coworkers have shown that, water model results do correspond to those measured on real flare trials...|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier in Section  2.3, other, probably less known, features {{recorded in the}} light maps are the so-called gas <b>flares.</b> These are <b>combustion</b> devices to burn flammable gas released during the operations of oil extraction. The gas is burned only for convenience, or for lack of infrastructure, so that the energy is wasted and huge amounts of CO 2 are released in the atmosphere. The monitoring of this harmful and quite uncontrolled activity is motivated by environmental and health concerns, besides energy efficiency reasons. Most gas flares burn uninterruptedly. Consequently, this phenomenon is still observable in the Stable Lights products. Using night light images, Elvidge et al. [6] estimated that, in 2008, approximately 139 billion cubic meters gas were wasted on a global scale. This is equivalent to 21 % of the total natural gas consumption of the U.S. and has a retail market value of $ 68 billion and {{an impact on the}} atmosphere of 278 million metric tons of CO 2 equivalent.|$|R
30|$|Gas <b>flares</b> are <b>combustion</b> devices used {{mainly in}} oil wells and big {{offshore}} platforms to burn flammable gas (mostly methane) released during {{the operations of}} oil extraction. They are a continuous phenomenon. Consequently, they are not filtered from the Stable Lights product. As {{the goal of this}} research is to study human settlements, they should be removed in order to avoid their misinterpretation as small cities. Gas flares have a characteristic circular shape of saturated pixels with glowing surroundings. These features make it possible to map their location [6]. The shapefiles, containing the gas flares’ geo-location, one per country, were downloaded from the NGDCf website and then merged within the ArcGIS system. The obtained mask was then converted into a binary raster so that the gas flares’ locations were given value zero, whereas all others pixels had a value of one. Every Stable Light composite was then multiplied with this raster to obtain images free of gas flares. Unfortunately, the polygons that encircle the gas flares are relatively large. Thus, it is unavoidable that certain areas of human-made lighting are improperly canceled out in this procedure. According to Henderson, [5], only 0.9 % of the world land area and 0.3 % of the world population in 2000, fell into the excluded polygons. Only a fraction of this is improperly excluded from the dataset. It is, however, not possible to quantify this error, but it must be a very small amount, given the meticulous selection procedure [6]. The small drawback of excluding this tiny fraction of data, however, does not outweigh keeping the whole set of gas flares in the composites.|$|R

Imaging spectrometers have recently become com-mercially available for general scientific use, thus enabling simultaneous capture of both spatial and spectral information without co-registration issues. However, their use against rapidly-varying sources has traditionally been considered prob-lematic, for even at moderate spatial and spectral resolutions the time to acquire a single spectrum can be long compared to the timescales associated with combustion events. This paper demonstrates that imaging Fourier-transform spectroscopy (IFTS) can successfully characterize the turbulent combustion exhaust from a turbojet engine. A Telops Hyper-Cam IFTS collected hyperspectral video from a Turbine Technologies SR- 30 turbojet engine with a spectral resolution of δν ̃ = 1 cm‑ 1 on a 200 × 64 pixel sub-window at a rate of 0. 3 Hz. Scene-change artifacts (SCAs) are present in the spectra; however, the stochastic fluctuations in source intensity translate into high-frequency “noise. ” Temporal averaging affords a significant reduction of the noise associated with SCAs. Emission from CO and CO 2 are clearly recognized in the averaged spectra, and information about their tempera-ture and relative concentrations is evident...|$|R
