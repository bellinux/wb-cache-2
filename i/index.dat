5|$|Hilsenhoff Biotic <b>Index</b> {{values for}} Kettle Creek have been measured.

The EPT <b>Index</b> (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera <b>Index)</b> has also been measured for the creek. It ranges from 10 to 25 with an average of 17. There are 285 vertebrate species that have the potential to inhabit the Kettle Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the refractive <b>index</b> {{generally is}} greater than 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive <b>index</b> to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the <b>index</b> of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the <b>index</b> of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive <b>index</b> less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E

5|$|A {{stochastic}} or {{random process}} {{can be defined as}} a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to <b>index</b> the random variables is called the <b>index</b> set. Historically, the <b>index</b> set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the <b>index</b> set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two <b>index</b> values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E
