2500|$|As the {{flagship}} of Bradley Transportation Company, the Bradley often carried corporate officials and guests in her state rooms. [...] She received {{more attention than}} the other ships in the fleet with <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> and red paint always fresh, her decks freshly hosed down, and a larger crew. The Bradley had individual rooms for the captain, chief mates, chief steward, and engine room officers. [...] The {{rest of the crew}} was housed in comfortable dormitory style rooms. [...] She had a [...] "state-of-the-art" [...] galley with huge refrigeration units and storage pantries. [...] Her engine room housed a huge generator powered by two Foster-Wheeler boilers. [...] The Bradley was the only fully electric ship in the Bradley Transportation fleet. Her generator powered everything from the propeller to the running lights.|$|E
60|$|But now, {{resolved}} and desperate, she steeled {{herself against}} him. He tried to face her, but <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> eyes looked out to him, steadily, from under cool, level brows, and {{he dropped his}} head upon her knee. Her hand strayed into his hair softly, and her face melted into solicitude and tenderness. But {{when he looked up}} again, <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> eyes were steady, her brows cool and level.|$|E
60|$|The sign {{hung on a}} pole, and on it {{was painted}} a picture of Mother Goose with <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> gander.|$|E

5000|$|Female Health Ed. {{teacher at}} Saki Girl's. A bitter older woman who {{always seems to}} have a scowl on her face. She dyes her hair black to cover <b>her</b> <b>grays</b> (even though hair dyeing is against the Saki Girl's rules).|$|R
50|$|<b>Her</b> surname (<b>Gray)</b> was {{mentioned}} only once, on April 4, 1953.|$|R
60|$|I {{stood and}} looked through the grating at my new secretary. I am not {{generally}} a diffident man, and have never been so with persons in my employment; but now, I must admit, I did not feel at my ease. The nun sat perfectly motionless; her hands were folded in <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> lap, and <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> bonnet was slightly bowed, so that I {{did not know whether}} she was gazing down at the table or out of the window.|$|E
60|$|Miss Mary, sitting primly {{behind her}} desk, with a ruler over her shoulder, opened <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> eyes widely at this, but said nothing.|$|E

40|$|Roger, a miller, {{says that}} he won't marry Kate unless he can also have <b>her</b> father's <b>gray</b> mare. <b>Her</b> father throws him out and tells him never to come back.

60|$|Molly {{shook her}} head over them, but got out <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> silk and fell to work, glad to show how well she could sew.|$|E
6000|$|... "Laws-a'-me! An' thet's months ago," [...] she replied, shaking <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> head. [...] "Milt, {{you should}} give up that wild life--an' marry--an' have a home." ...|$|E
60|$|Her mouth relaxed a little. The glasses turned upon Bradley again, {{and looked}} upon him so {{steadily}} {{that he was}} able to see <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> eyes.|$|E

60|$|And as {{she looked}} out on the sea from her narrow window, it seemed to <b>her</b> dismally <b>gray,</b> moaning, restless, and dreary.|$|R
60|$|The {{old woman}} seated {{herself on the}} trunk of the fallen tree, threw aside the hood that {{shrouded}} <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> locks and beckoned her companion to draw near.|$|E
6000|$|... "How did YOU {{happen to}} be here?" [...] she asked suddenly, opening <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> eyes upon him. [...] "What {{did you come here}} for?" [...] she went on, almost impertinently.|$|E
60|$|The red-haired woman--for she did {{not appear}} to be a girl any more--halted before his chair and gazed down at him, with a terrible flare of scorn in <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> eyes.|$|E
5000|$|Called by Chinese {{media as}} the [...] "Iron Lady of China", Wu was {{regarded}} as a firm and direct woman who, unlike her mostly male colleagues, chose not to dye <b>her</b> <b>graying</b> hair black. Wu did not marry all her life.

60|$|Norah {{showed an}} even greater change; she had now {{attained}} her full height, her figure had filled out, and {{she stood on the}} threshold of womanhood and bid fair to attain a high degree of beauty of the type characteristic of her nationality. Her hair was dark, <b>her</b> eyes <b>gray,</b> <b>her</b> expression changing rapidly from grave to gay, the latter movement generally predominating.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> antagonist's <b>gray</b> eyes sparkled for {{the first}} time, and she took a quick step forward, with one white hand half lifted in rebuke.|$|R

60|$|Then {{she went}} away, and Christie soon followed, looking very like a Quaker bride in <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> gown with no {{ornament}} but delicate frills at neck and wrist, and the roses in her bosom.|$|E
6000|$|The {{change in}} his face {{was not lost on}} Mercy. <b>Her</b> large <b>gray</b> eyes watched him attentively. [...] "Is the lady seriously wounded?" [...] she asked.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> big <b>gray</b> {{eyes seemed}} to search Marvin's for an instant and Marvin had, almost subconsciously, a {{comfortable}} feeling {{that he had been}} tested and found worthy.|$|R
60|$|The Venus Annodomini {{looked at}} him across the half-light of the room, and <b>her</b> big <b>gray</b> eyes filled with moisture. She rose and shook hands with him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Wilfrid, {{my early}} loved," [...] slowly gasped she, {{removing}} <b>her</b> <b>gray</b> {{hair from her}} furrowed temples, and gazing on her boy fondly, as he nestled on Ivanhoe's knee--"promise me, by St. Waltheof of Templestowe--promise me one boon!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then 'tis from you, Madame la Marquise, that {{we require}} an {{explanation}} for this unseemly disturbance," [...] rejoined Her Majesty turning <b>her</b> cold, <b>gray</b> eyes on Lydie.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{portrait}} of Susana Ruiz de Sepulveda, [s. d. ].

The photo is visible in an oval cutout...|$|R
6000|$|She {{lifted her}} head, with the steady light of {{resolution}} shining again in <b>her</b> grand, <b>gray</b> eyes. <b>Her</b> low, sweet voice answered him, without a faltering note in it, ...|$|R
