50|$|Non Intrusive Appliance Monitoring is {{a method}} to {{determine}} from a centralized point (e.g. a <b>fuse</b> <b>board</b> or distribution point) what appliances are being powered on and off in a building without {{the need to have}} individual sensors on individual loads.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{awareness}} for {{the need to provide}} low cost solutions for the care of the elderly and in particular to allow them to keep living independent lives. In parallel to this there has also been significant advances in a number of technical areas including 1) monitoring electricity consumption for the purpose of reducing power costs, 2) non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), 3) using sensors to determine activities of daily living and 4) cloud computing. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} use a readily available consumer off the shelf electricity monitor to provide a low intrusive activity monitor for older persons. This work uses the Design Science Research Methodology and builds on the results of our previous work that used raw electricity usage data. In this work we are trailing the use of a meter that uses NILM to identify individual appliances in the home. The information on appliance use was analysed by a cloud base program and alerts were sent to the carer when lower than expected activity was detected. Participants both in this work and those reported in the literature have mentioned the annoyance of having multiple sensors in a home, especially if they emit either constant or flashing light. In contrast NILM allows the use of multiple electrical appliances to be monitored without the need for a large number of sensors to be deployed â€“ just one sensor at the meter or <b>fuse</b> <b>board.</b> The confluence of a number of technologies has enabled the creation of a low intrusive and low cost monitoring system to have become a reality. The initial trial of the system has been shown to be a mostly reliable alternative to a system built on multiple sensors. Based on previous work that involved the deployment of multiple sensors, the new system is expected to be more acceptable as it has the desired attribute of becoming invisible to the user...|$|E
2500|$|In North America, fuses {{were used}} in {{buildings}} wired before 1960. These Edison base fuses would screw into a fuse socket similar to Edison-base incandescent lamps. [...] Ratings were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 amperes. To prevent installation of fuses with an excessive current rating, later fuse boxes included rejection features in the fuse-holder socket, commonly known as Rejection Base (Type S fuses) which have smaller diameters that {{vary depending on the}} rating of the fuse. This means that fuses can only be replaced by the preset (Type S) fuse rating. This is a North American, tri-national standard (UL 4248-11; CAN/CSA-C22.2 NO. 4248.11-07 (R2012); and, NMX-J-009/4248/11-ANCE). Existing Edison <b>fuse</b> <b>boards</b> can easily be converted to only accept Rejection Base (Type S) fuses, by screwing-in a tamper-proof adapter. [...] This adapter screws into the existing Edison fuse holder, and has a smaller diameter threaded hole to accept the designated Type S rated fuse.|$|R

"Alas! sir, when I was {{lighting}} the <b>fuses</b> on <b>board</b> the Swallow, I {{let it fall}} in my haste, and it is--in exactly the same place as are all your worship's worthy comrades who were on board that ship. I believe, however, that if you will put yourself under my guidance I could show your Excellency the spot, and this, as I {{do not want to}} be killed, I should be most happy to do." ...|$|R
50|$|Consumer unit, {{consumer}} control unit, or consumer distribution unit (CU, CDU, CCU; {{historically and}} commonly, <b>fuse</b> board/box): Distribution <b>board</b> designed for ordinary low voltage single phase premises, primarily domestic and light commercial wiring. 3-phase power distribution boards are usually known as distribution boards.|$|R
50|$|The ring {{starts at}} the {{consumer}} unit (also known as <b>fuse</b> box, distribution <b>board,</b> or breaker box), visits each socket in turn, and then returns to the consumer unit. The ring is fed from a fuse or circuit breaker in the consumer unit.|$|R
25|$|The {{distribution}} board system used in Irish homes also differs substantially from {{those used in}} the UK and elsewhere. All distribution <b>boards</b> (<b>fuse</b> boxes) are required to have a 'main fuse' or 'main breaker' rated at the maximum permissible load for that installation. Typically, this is a 63 A fuse and a switch, or a Minized fuse isolator which accepts a Neozed fuse.|$|R
50|$|In February 2006, Metal Asylum {{disappeared}} from the air without any explanation from the network or Chernetsky herself. In early March 2006, the Fuse TV website was redesigned and Chernetsky along with fellow Fuse VJ Adonis Thompson {{were not on the}} list. Broadcasts of the F-List were played in Metal Asylums timeslot during the month of February, and on the <b>Fuse</b> message <b>board,</b> it was stated that her contract had not been renewed which irked many loyal viewers. Previous rumors had stated that Chernetskys absence was due to her recovering from surgery; however, Chernetsky confirmed her exit from Fuse via her MySpace page and details the fact Fuse wanted to become more family friendly and none of her programs exhibited that quality, and she was then removed.|$|R
50|$|Island {{challenge}} - In {{the first}} round the captains had to remove <b>fuses</b> from a <b>board.</b> They were suspended on elastic ropes and had to use ropes to climb down and retrieve the fuses. Once they had a fuse they then had to throw them into a storage container, {{in order for a}} fuse to count the whole of it had to enter the box. As soon as they let go of the rope they got flung back to the top.|$|R
50|$|The {{laminated}} carton {{was among}} the most innovative developments in packaging over the last 60 years. Laminated cartons are made from layers of paper <b>board</b> <b>fused</b> with a plastic lining containing a small amount of aluminium. The packaging can keep liquids fresh over long distances and periods of time, locked within a safe seal.The composition of laminated cartons makes it difficult to separate the various components from the paper. Recycling cartons is therefore more complicated than simply recycling paper and/or pieces of plastic.There are no recycling facilities available for laminated cartons in the UK at the moment so post-consumer cartons that are collected by local councils are sent to land fill in the UK or shipped to mainland Europe for incineration or specialist recycling. The global recycling rate of laminated cartons is approximately 20% of the 175 billion cartons sold in 2011.|$|R
40|$|At present, the Navy {{is unable}} to provide a robust, routable network that {{provides}} real-time actionable intelligence between boarding operations and intelligence analysts. Actionable intelligence is the means of obtaining concrete knowledge that permits an individual to take action based on known information. The lack of a robust routable network creates a lag in operational responsiveness to potential threats identified within the Maritime Environment. In response to current shortfalls, improved Extended Maritime Interdiction Operations (EMIO) seeks to support the Secretary of the Navy's vision to streamline and improve operations and exploitation of boarding data. However, {{there has been no}} clear indication as to how the implementation of these technologies will affect command and control or current operations. This thesis examines the impact of improved EMIO technology designed to bridge together data with intelligence collected during EMIO and improve maritime domain decision making in terms of speed and quality and thus improve end user's situational awareness. We follow the construct of Business Process Reengineering (BPR) to frame our analysis and to provide focus in our data collection. We also examine the changes to the present EMIO process by developing and implementing an organizational simulation using POWER 2. 0. Our results indicate that when improved Spiral- 1 EMIO technologies, which significantly decrease the amount of time it takes to <b>fuse</b> collected <b>boarding</b> data into intelligence systems, are combined with a redesign of the EMIO organization, a qualitative improvement toward accomplishing the overall process can be achieved. The current process requires 35 hours. Yet, with the revised technological and proposed organizational changes, the same process can be achieved in 5 hours, thus achieving the Navy Secretary's vision to streamline and improve maritime operations.
