The pigs must be removed, as many pigs are rented, pigs wear and must be replaced, and cleaning (and other) pigs push contaminants from the pipeline such as wax, foreign objects, hydrates, etc., which must be removed from the pipeline. There are inherent risks in opening the barrel to atmospheric pressure so care must be taken to ensure that the barrel is depressurized prior to opening. If the barrel is not completely depressurized, the pig can be ejected from the barrel and operators have been severely injured when standing in front of an open pig door. By accident, one pig was shot out of the end of a pipeline without a proper pig receiver and went through the side of a house 500 feet away. When the product is sour, the barrel should be evacuated to a <b>flare</b> <b>system</b> where the sour gas is burnt.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet {{increasingly}} strict environmental regulations and to promote cleaner energy at their facilities, many oil, gas, and petrochemical companies are seeking to upgrade existing flares to allow smokeless flaring of hydrocarbon gases. The main areas of application for these flare upgrades are located in Russia, Africa, Middle East, South America, and other countries with high oil production capabilities and programs. Many of these areas have utility flares located in facilities where a shortage of steam or water prevents conventional smokeless steam-injection systems from being added. Mr. Mazen Mashour of Saudi Arabian Oil Company has patented a new smokeless flaring technology using high-pressure air. This technology is called High Pressure Air Assist System (HPAAS) and has been successfully implemented on dozens of <b>flare</b> <b>systems</b> in Saudi Arabia.

40|$|Process {{safety is}} a disciplined {{framework}} {{for managing the}} integrity of operating systems and processes handling hazardous substances. It is achieved by applying good design principles, engineering, and operating and maintenance practices. Flare systems {{play an important role}} in the safety of Oil and Gas installations by serving as outlets for emergency pressure relief in case of process upsets. Accurate and reliable estimation of system thermo-hydraulic parameters, especially system back-pressure is critical to the integrity of a <b>flare</b> <b>system</b> design. Accurate design of the <b>flare</b> <b>system</b> plays a key role in containing possible process safety hazards on the oil and gas installation, especially oil and gas offshore platforms. In order to enable uniformity and consistency, design guidelines and constraints are provided within the industry, both national and international standards - NORSOK, API and ISO - which serve as recommended practice in process and <b>flare</b> <b>system</b> design. This thesis is focused on analyzing the back-pressure build-up in the high pressure <b>flare</b> <b>system</b> at Kollsnes gas processing plant. The relief scenario considered in this thesis is pool fire case in condensate system in Kollsnes gas processing plant. The simulation tool used to model the <b>flare</b> <b>system</b> in this case is Aspen Tech's <b>Flare</b> <b>system</b> analyzer (known as FLARENET), is a steady state simulation tool. The FLARENET model includes the pressure safety valves (PSV), downstream tail pipes, flare header, flare knock out drum and flare stack. All the actual plant data are given as input to the model so as to get the more practical result. After running the simulation model, it emerges that for a total relieving rate of 108. 33 kg/sec (Vapor flow) in pool fire scenario, the back-pressure generated at some of the PSV's in the relief network is 10. 6 Barg against their set pressure of 10 Barg. This raises serious process safety concern as the relieving rate from the PSVs is drastically reduced due to very high back-pressure, which in turn will increase the pressure inside the process equipment exposed to fire. This concern has been conveyed to the Kollsnes plant operations group. To verify the results obtained from FLARENET simulation, I had undertaken actual plant verification. This was carried out in co-ordination with the Kollsnes plant operations group during September 2012, just before annual maintenance shutdown of the plant. The back-pressure results obtained as a result of controlled blow-down from the plant matched well with the FLARENET simulation results. Further follow up tasks is being under taken by Statoil ASA to alleviate the back-pressure problem. This thesis suggests two options for solving the problems. Further evaluation of the suggestion and its implementation in the plant is going on in the company. This thesis also opens door for further research on high back-pressure in <b>flare</b> <b>system</b> and analyze the problem dynamically. This will reduce the conservative steady state assumptions and will have much wider industrial acceptability with respect to cost savings potential...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the production technology of oil-furnace carbon black, {{as well as}} the selected solution for preventing the emissions of this process from contaminating the environment. The products of industrial oil-furnace carbon black production are different grades of carbon black and process tail gases. The qualitative composition of these tail gases during the production of oil-furnace carbon black are: carbon(IV) oxide, carbon(II) oxide, hydrogen, methane, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor. The quantitative composition and lower caloric value of process tail gases change {{depending on the type of}} feedstock used in the production, {{as well as the}} type of process. The lower caloric value of process tail gases is relatively small with values ranging between 1500 and 2300 kJ m– 3. In the conventional production of oil-furnace carbon black, process tail gases purified from carbon black dust are freely released into the atmosphere untreated. In this manner, the process tail gases pollute the air in the town of Kutina, because their quantitative values are much higher than the prescribed emissions limits for hydrogen sulfide and carbon(II) oxide. A logical solution for the prevention of such air pollution is combustion of the process tail gases, i. e. their thermal oxidation. For this purpose, a specially designed <b>flare</b> <b>system</b> has been developed. Consuming minimum amounts of natural gas needed for oxidation, the <b>flare</b> <b>system</b> is designed to combust low caloric process tail gases with 99 % efficiency. Thus, the toxic and flammable components of the tail gases (hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, carbon(II) oxide, methane and other trace hydrocarbons) would be transformed into environmentally acceptable components (sulfur(IV) oxide, water, carbon(IV) oxide and nitrogen(IV) oxide), which are in compliance with the emissions limit values prescribed by law. Proper operation of this <b>flare</b> <b>system</b> in the production of oil-furnace carbon black would solve the air pollution problem in the town of Kutina, especially the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide in the troposphere. Together with the development of this <b>flare</b> <b>system,</b> a continuous air-pollutant (hydrogen sulfide and carbon(II) oxide) monitoring system shall be established and linked with the Environmental Protection Agenc...|$|E

40|$|In the past, {{refineries}} and petrochemical {{plants have}} emphasized the need to prevent and minimize major hydrocarbon releases to the flare.

Flare gas flow is not easily measured and as a result, most plants are unaware of how much product they are actually losing during normal operation. This report will discuss a tracer technique used to accurately measure flare losses. Plants can use several methods to reduce hydrocarbon losses during normal operation. The following three are primarily used: 1) monitor the <b>flare</b> <b>system</b> and take corrective action to minimize hydrocarbon releases, 2) install flare gas recovery systems, and 3) recover or reduce process streams which have to be continuous 1 y vented to the <b>flare</b> <b>system.</b> This report discusses alternate designs for flare gas monitoring and flare gas recovery systems and also presents several case studies...|$|E

40|$|Equipment Description Flares {{are used}} to ignite areas {{remotely}} that are not easily accessible on foot. When used with a flare launcher in a <b>flare</b> <b>system,</b> the point of ignition can be 300 feet away. One of the two basic types of flare systems uses a flare launcher that breaks open so a self-contained cartridge similar to a shotgun shell can be loaded (figure 4 – 1). The cartridge contains the flare and the powder to propel it. The flare launcher is typically cast aluminum or plastic. The flare launcher is opened and a cartridge is inserted into the launcher. The launcher is pointed toward the area to be burned and the operator pulls the trigger, igniting the powder Interagency Ground Ignition Guide and launching the flare. These flare launchers typically {{range in size from}} 12 gauge to 25 millimeters. A second type of <b>flare</b> <b>system</b> (figure 4 – 2) has a launcher with separate cartridges (also known as blanks or power loads) to propel the flare. The cartridges are loaded into a cylinder that is installed in the launcher. Each cylinder holds nine cartridges. A flare is loaded into the barrel, the launcher is pointed in the desired direction, and the trigger is pulled. The cartridge fires, ignites the flare, and propels it to the area to be burned. Up to nine flares may be fired before the cylinder must be removed and reloaded with new cartridges. Figure 4 – 1 —An Orion flare launcher with an Orion 12 -gauge flare.

40|$|This thesis investigates how to {{optimize}} the calculation of thermal radiation from an advanced <b>flare</b> <b>system</b> in the numerical computation tool Kameleon FireEx (KFX). Measured radiation levels from a real flaring scenario at an offshore installation are used as reference. The <b>flare</b> <b>system</b> consists of one high pressure flare and one low pressure flare. An optimal approach for calculating radiation levels implies a trade-off between accuracy of the solution and numerical simulation time. To obtain {{a high degree of}} accuracy the size of the release cells and the nearby cells must be sufficiently small to capture the large gradients close to the release. This makes requirements of how the release cells should be defined and different configurations have been tried. The first cases were simulated using only one release cell for each flare which gives a low resolution. The resolution has then been refined by dividing the release cells into multiple smaller cells. There is a clear connection between the refinement of the release cells and the accuracy of the calculated radiation levels. The smaller cells are used, the greater agreement there is between simulated and measured radiation levels. Smaller cells lead to longer simulation time but this can be reduced by removing cells other places in the calculation domain. As the process equipment usually existing on the platform deck is removed in this specific scenario as a simplification, this allows for larger cell sizes far away from the flares. The conclusion {{of this study is that}} using 9 release cells for the high pressure flare together with 4 release cells for the low pressure flare was the most optimal approach for the scenario simulated in this thesis. It was in this case very low deviation between simulated and measured radiation levels, and the simulation time was considered acceptable. This configuration might not be the most optimal for any given flare; therefore sensitivity tests regarding release cell size should be conducted for other scenarios. The general conclusion is nevertheless that a high resolution of the release cells will give more accurate radiation levels...|$|E
