5000|$|A process {{includes}} {{any group}} of vessels which are interconnected or separate and contain <b>Highly</b> <b>Hazardous</b> Chemicals (HHC's) which could {{be involved in a}} potential release. A process safety incident is the [...] "Unexpected release of toxic, reactive, or flammable liquids and gases in processes involving <b>highly</b> <b>hazardous</b> chemicals. Incidents continue to occur in various industries that use <b>highly</b> <b>hazardous</b> chemicals which exhibit toxic, reactive, flammable, or even explosive properties, or may exhibit a combination of these properties. Regardless of the industry that uses these <b>highly</b> <b>hazardous</b> chemicals, there is a potential for an accidental release any time they are not properly controlled. This, in turn, creates the possibility of disaster. To help assure safe and healthy workplaces, OSHA has issued the Process Safety Management of <b>Highly</b> <b>Hazardous</b> Chemicals regulation (Title 29 of CFR Section 1910.119) [...] which contains requirements for the management of hazards associated with processes using <b>highly</b> <b>hazardous</b> chemicals." ...|$|R

30|$|The FSC {{criteria}} for rating of herbicides as <b>highly</b> <b>hazardous</b> changed in 2015. This change {{led to the}} removal of terbuthylazine and hexazinone from the FSC list of <b>highly</b> <b>hazardous</b> pesticides (HHP). This was a positive outcome for many growers. However, another widely used herbicide, picloram, {{was added to the}} list (Forest Stewardship Council 2015). Picloram is used to manage scrub weeds such as C. scoparius and U. europaeus so {{there is a need to}} find alternatives. There is continued interest in New Zealand in the potential of non-residual herbicides for effective forest weed control because of the generally dynamic nature of pesticide regulations globally at present. This interest is partly attributed to the requirement for certified forest growers to continually strive to reduce dependence on the use of herbicides for weed control.|$|R
