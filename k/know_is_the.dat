500|$|Rogers {{encountered}} {{various problems}} along the way. Forty of the Bristol crew deserted or were dismissed, {{and he spent}} a month in Ireland recruiting replacements and having the vessels prepared for sea. Many crew members were Dutch, Danish, or other foreigners. [...] Some of the crew mutinied after Rogers refused to let them plunder a neutral Swedish vessel. When the mutiny was put down, he had the leader flogged, put in irons, and sent to England aboard another ship. The less culpable mutineers were given lighter punishments, such as reduced rations. [...] The ships intended to force the chilly Drake Passage off the tip of South America, but expedition leaders soon realised that they were short of warm clothing and alcohol, which was then believed to warm those exposed to cold. Considering the latter the more important problem, the expedition made a stop at Tenerife {{to stock up on}} the local wine, and later sewed the ships' blankets into cold weather gear. [...] The ships experienced a difficult inter-oceanic passage; they were forced to almost 62° South latitude, which, according to Rogers, [...] "for ought we <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> furthest that any one has yet been to the southward". [...] At their furthest south, they were closer to as-yet-undiscovered Antarctica than to South America.|$|E
500|$|In a 6 September 1777 letter, Johnson told Thrale to be [...] "punctual in annexing the dates. Chronology you <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> eye of history". However, {{the system}} of Ana allowed Thrale to group items by theme instead of by topics, like [...] "Odd medical Stories", to {{organize}} anecdotes, quotations, and stories. When Henry Thrale died while Thrale was writing Volume Three, the work became a diary for Thrale to discuss her thoughts and feelings after her loss. This volume soon began to describe Thrale's feelings for Gabriel Piozzi. Throughout the Thraliana, Thrale examines how others view her, which reveals her anxieties that she had about how she was perceived. This is especially true when she writes: [...] "Life has been to me nothing but a perpetual Canvass carried on {{in all parts of}} the World - not to make Friends neither - for I have certainly found very few - but to keep off Enemies". Thrale initially did not want to write in the sixth volume of the Thraliana, but did so because [...] "Johnson said that Pleasure might one day be made from such Nonsense, so I'll e'en finish this last Volume of Anecdote & store up no more Stuff". However she did not stop journal writing after she finished but continued to write for the remainder of her life.|$|E

2500|$|For 160 years Wirt's {{account was}} taken at face value. In the 1970s, historians began to {{question}} the authenticity of Wirt's reconstruction. Contemporary historians observe that Henry was known to have used fear of Indian and slave revolts in promoting military action against the British and that, according to the only written first-hand account of the speech, Henry used some graphic name-calling that Wirt did not include in his heroic rendition.

It contains {{a greater percentage of}} mid and up-tempo songs, along with a much heavier and grander use of live instrumentation. Williams contributed lyrically to the album as she did with her debut album, co-writing a total of six songs. However, Do You Know is much more diverse, lyrically, than its predecessor Heart to Yours, covering the themes of [...] "spiritual" [...] and [...] "carnal" [...] love and contains retrospective songs about Williams' career thus far, whilst still retaining the inspirational and encouraging lyrics that characterised Heart to Yours.|$|E
2500|$|Prehistoric Native American {{artifacts}} {{have been}} found at Mammoth Hot Springs and other geothermal areas in Yellowstone. Some accounts state that the early people used hot water from the geothermal features for bathing and cooking. In the 19th century Father Pierre-Jean De Smet reported that natives he interviewed thought that geyser eruptions were [...] "the result of combat between the infernal spirits." [...] The Lewis and Clark Expedition traveled north of the Yellowstone area in 1806. Local natives that they came upon seldom dared to enter what we now <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> caldera because of frequent loud noises that sounded like thunder {{and the belief that}} the spirits that possessed the area did not like human intrusion into their realm. The first white man known to travel into the caldera and see the geothermal features was John Colter, who had left the Lewis and Clark Expedition. He described what he saw as [...] "hot spring brimstone." [...] Beaver trapper Joseph Meek recounted in 1830 that the steam rising from the various geyser basins reminded him of smoke coming from industrial smokestacks on a cold winter morning in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the 1850s famed trapper Jim Bridger called it [...] "the place where Hell bubbled up." ...|$|E
