5|$|Not all {{withdrawal}} {{effects are}} evidence of true dependence or withdrawal.

We show that the Aft 1 p binding region of the FET 3 promoter or the Mac 1 p binding region of the CTR 1 promoter is necessary and sufficient to mediate heme-deficient repression. Transcription is repressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> heme, and a genetic screen identified Tup 1 p and Hda 1 p as being required for transcriptional repression. In contrast to FET 3 and CTR 1, Aft 1 p target genes ARN 1 and FIT 1 are transcribed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> heme. A 14 bp sequence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ARN 1 promoter is necessary and sufficient to permit transcription <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> heme. Transcription <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> heme required <b>the</b> presence of Cti 6 p to overcome the effect of Tup 1 p, and Cti 6 p was recruited to the ARN 1 promoter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> heme.

In 1948, he scored 180 in the fixture, the highest score of his career; in combination with his success in Middlesex matches, he finished {{on top of the}} English batting averages that season. He played his final Middlesex games in 1950, captaining the team in four matches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regular captain, and made his final first-class appearance for the Free Foresters in 1954.

His writings were banned, however, and copies of their work confiscated. In 1916, Mercier was officially prohibited from publishing pamphlets but continued to campaign against the deportation of workers and various other German policies. Initially opposed by Pope Benedict XV, who was anxious to remain neutral, the Pope was supportive of the Belgian church but encouraged it to moderate its stance to avoid confrontation.|$|E
