5|$|Two essay {{collections}} {{were published}} during Orwell's lifetime—Inside the Whale and Other Essays in 1940 and Critical Essays in 1946 (the latter {{published in the}} United States as Dickens, Dali, and Others in 1958.) His publisher followed up these anthologies with Shooting an Elephant and Other Essays in 1950, England Your England and Other Essays in 1953—which was revised as Such, Such Were the Joys—and Collected Essays in 1961. The first significant publications in the United States were Doubleday's A Collection of Essays by George Orwell from 1954, 1956's The Orwell Reader, Fiction, Essays, and Reportage from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, and Penguin's Selected Essays in 1957; re-released in 1962 with the title Inside the Whale and Other Essays and in abridged form as Why I Write in 2005 {{as a part of}} the <b>Great</b> <b>Ideas</b> series. In the aforementioned series, Penguin also published the short collections Books v. Cigarettes (2008), Some Thoughts on the Common Toad (2010), and Decline of the English Murder (2009). The later does not contain the same texts as Decline of the English Murder and Other Essays, published by Penguin in association with Secker & Warburg in 1965. The complete texts Orwell wrote for the Observer are collected in Orwell: The Observer Years published by Atlantic Books in 2003.|$|E
25|$|At {{roughly the}} same time, Kierkegaard was {{discovered}} by several proponents of the Jewish-Christian philosophy of dialogue in Germany, namely by Martin Buber, Ferdinand Ebner, and Franz Rosenzweig. In addition to the philosophy of dialogue, existential philosophy has its point of origin in Kierkegaard and his concept of individuality. Martin Heidegger sparsely refers to Kierkegaard in Being and Time (1927), obscuring how much he owes to him. Walter Kaufmann discussed Sartre, Jaspers, and Heidegger in relation to Kierkegaard, and Kierkegaard {{in relation to the}} crisis of religion in the 1960s. Later, Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling (Series Two) and The Sickness Unto Death (Series Three) were included in the Penguin <b>Great</b> <b>Ideas</b> Series (Two and Three).|$|E

500|$|... "Slow Fade" [...] {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reception from music critics. Jared Johnson of Allmusic noted {{it had a}} [...] "mature rock theme" [...] and [...] "showcased more grunge guitar than could be heard on all of Lifesong". In reviews for Billboard and CCM Magazine, Deborah Evans Price praised the song as [...] "compelling" [...] and an example of Mark Hall's ability to write [...] "stirring anthems" [...] and [...] "achingly vulnerable, introspective songs". Andree Farias of Christianity Today praised the lyrics as [...] "full of <b>great</b> <b>ideas</b> about spiritual apostasy" [...] but said the arrangement [...] "leaves the impression that [...] Hall and company are bored or tired".|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Mangini joined Dream Theater, Portnoy e-mailed {{the band}} asking to rejoin, but his attempt was rebuffed. Reflecting on his arrival to the band, Mangini told Noisecreep, [...] "As I see it, as I look back, I really think what {{happened}} was that this band kind of started over. They were in a new place as they looked for a drummer, and I when got the news, after the shock wore off, I knew what I wanted to do – which was just basically come in and try to support where they wanted to go.

[...] I love working with Tom Cruise." [...] Cruise met with Spielberg during the filming of Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002) and gave three options of films to create together, one of them being an adaptation of The War of the Worlds. Spielberg chose The War of the Worlds and stated, [...] "We {{looked at each other}} and the lights went on. [...] As soon as I heard it, I said 'Oh my God! War of the Worlds – absolutely.'

500|$|When {{they were}} going to record the song, Bailey said that he was excited, nervous, and [...] "almost over-prepared for it", he knew exactly what {{instruments}} were going on every track; it took three days to record. Before the release the song was remixed by Sadkin at RAK Studios, in London. About the process Bailey commented: [...] "You know what a great producer is? It's someone who takes <b>great</b> <b>ideas</b> and makes them into good records. In our field, great music is a hit record." [...] The song became the Thompson Twins' biggest hit in America, {{but at the same time}} it pressured the band to produce top-selling music, even if they were not completely comfortable with that, as Alannah Currie stated in an interview with David Oriard of The Spokesman-Review: ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{review of the}} game in 2008, Destructoid's Conrad Zimmerman criticized Wizards & WarriorsIII for many issues. While he initially praised the game for its depth, he criticized the game by comparing Kuros to the previous games in the series, saying that he is [...] "still a good-looking knight with a useless sword which he holds as if it were his manhood when jumping" [...] and adding that he [...] "is {{still one of the most}} inept fighters in videogame history". He also criticizes the game for its lack of action and fighting, saying that it is [...] "more of a platforming game with the occasional boss fight". Other criticisms include slow and unresponsive controls and hard-to-defeat bosses. Overall, he says that Wizards & WarriorsIII [...] "isn't a bad game, just one that has some <b>great</b> <b>ideas</b> hampered by serious flaws".|$|E
500|$|Chris Mincher of The A.V. Club was {{disappointed}} with the album, finding it stripped of its songwriting and control in lead singer Nathan Willett's voice from their debut album. Blake Solomon of AbsolutePunk found the album lacking in terms of instrumentals and songwriting saying, [...] "It's easy to see the <b>great</b> <b>ideas</b> from previous songs at work here, {{but there seems to}} be an intentional restraint placed on the band's likeable pop inclinations." [...] The Guardian criticized the album for its lackluster blues rock production and Willett's performance, saying [...] "his voice is too drearily clean-cut to deliver a true emotional punch." [...] Ian Cohen of Pitchfork felt that the album was hampered by the band's uninspired musicianship and songwriting and the hype surrounding them, saying that [...] "Proponents raved that Cold War Kids arrived fully formed, but as the band continues to stubbornly emphasize their weaknesses, Loyalty To Loyalty is proof that their detractors can say the same thing." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} the music video was a joint {{collaboration}} between Gaga and Lawrence. Originally, the video {{was going to be}} shot in New York City, with more elaborate sets, including sets outdoors. The idea was scrapped, however, for budgetary reasons: [...] the budget for the video was low and there was no product placement. Because of Gaga's schedule, the video was shot in Los Angeles over a two-day period. Lawrence described Gaga's work ethic and creativity during the video shoot: [...] "She loves the art form of music videos and she is a real creative partner and has <b>great</b> <b>ideas</b> and really cool and unique tastes. She has a great team working with her as well, helping build really fantastic things that she wears. She works hard, she shows up on time and she's pretty spontaneous ... it was great ... if she had a new song and wanted to do something, I would do it in a second. She was really fun to work with." ...|$|E
500|$|Initial {{reception}} of Ikaruga in Japan was mixed. Players did praise the graphics and music, but opinions were {{divided on the}} gameplay system. Director Hiroshi Iuchi noted that players would tell him “this isn’t an arcade game...make it more thrilling and fast-paced.” Both Iuchi and producer Masoto Maegawa stated that this mixed reception was due to players expecting a more standard shooter offering. They both felt Ikaruga was a brand new type of shooter and that bringing variety was important {{to the growth of}} game centers. The original Dreamcast port of Ikaruga was well received by Greg Kasavin of GameSpot. He praised the game for its graphics, sound, and challenging difficulty. He also praised the game for bringing back a dead genre to the forefront, saying [...] "Ikaruga takes 20 years of <b>great</b> <b>ideas</b> in game design and somehow manages to put an entirely new spin on them...for the sake of making a game that's both familiar and utterly unique." ...|$|E
500|$|Explaining how Ben Stiller {{came to be}} cast in {{the role}} of Greg, Roach states: [...] "I saw Meet the Parents as an anxiety dream, and in my view nobody plays that kind of {{material}} better than Ben." [...] Additionally, Roach was impressed with Stiller's creative and ad lib abilities stating that [...] "he has lots of <b>great</b> <b>ideas</b> and he's very skilled at loose improvisation." [...] Stiller's character Gaylord [...] "Greg" [...] Focker is a nurse who loves his girlfriend and tries desperately to impress her parents by any means which includes telling harmless little lies which are then covered up with bigger lies and elaborate cover-up schemes. The film's script was initially written with Jim Carrey {{in the role of}} Greg and contained much more physical comedy, something that Stiller did not think would be successful with himself playing the role. This resulted in deletion of some scenes but also in introduction of at least one unscripted scene that was completely improvised by Stiller. Roach cast Stiller only after it became clear that Carrey would not be taking on the role.|$|E

500|$|The {{concepts}} {{behind the}} episode {{were difficult to}} transfer from script to film. Spotnitz later explained that, [...] "William Gibson and Tom Maddox always get us into trouble. They always come up with these <b>great</b> <b>ideas</b> that are always hard to execute." [...] In addition, budgetary challenges faced the production of [...] "First Person Shooter." [...] Due to all the special effects needed for the episode, the episode nearly drastically went over budget. In order to not over-spend, the production crew lent various virtual game layouts from video game companies. Not wishing to simply [...] "copy existing designs," [...] production designer Corey Kaplan and his design team created [...] "some pretty pictures" [...] to differentiate the crews' design from the video game companies'. Much of the opening action was filmed at a Rykoff food distribution company in Los Angeles. At the time, the company's owner was the uncle of X-Files producer Paul Rabwin. In addition, a warehouse in downtown Los Angeles filled in for {{the backdrop of the}} opening scene.|$|E
500|$|... "Whiplash" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Greg Kurstin, with additional writing by Nicole Morier and Britney Spears. The latter had recorded [...] "Heaven on Earth", written by Morier and songwriting team Freescha, for her fifth studio album Blackout (2007). During {{an interview with}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Spears named the song her favorite from the album. When she started recording her sixth studio album Circus (2008), she contacted Morier to write songs with her. When the two were in the studio, they asked Kurstin to give them tracks. Among the songs they worked on were [...] "Mmm Papi", [...] "Rock Me In" [...] and [...] "Whiplash". Both {{wanted to do something}} that Spears had not done before. [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] and [...] "Rock Me In" [...] were included in Circus; however, [...] "Whiplash" [...] failed to make the cut. Morier explained, [...] "There’s a couple songs we started that were <b>great</b> <b>ideas</b> but just incomplete.

Michael Wale of The Times described the piece as [...] "...bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning." [...] Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times wrote [...] "The ambition of the Floyd's artistic intention is now vast." [...] Melody Maker was, however, less enthusiastic: [...] "Musically, there were some <b>great</b> <b>ideas,</b> but the sound effects often left me wondering if I was in a bird-cage at London zoo." [...] However, the following tour was praised by the public. The new material was performed live, in the same order in which it would eventually be recorded, but obvious differences between the live version, and the recorded version released a year later, included the lack of synthesizers in tracks such as [...] "On the Run", and Bible readings that were later replaced by Clare Torry's non-lexical vocables on [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky".|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of [...] "She Wolf", [...] "Did It Again" [...] was {{serviced}} as the next single from the album She Wolf, (2009), and is the second single overall. [...] "Did It Again" [...] was written by Shakira and Pharrell Williams, {{and is one of}} the four tracks on the album Shakira co-produced with The Neptunes, the others being [...] "Long Time", [...] "Why Wait", and [...] "Good Stuff". About her collaboration with Williams, Shakira commented, [...] "he comes up with ideas, and he executes them immediately. It's really cool, because I'm a little bit slower, and he's the man with the big strokes, and he really comes with <b>great</b> <b>ideas.</b> It was a great synergy". A Spanish version of the song, titled [...] "Lo Hecho Está Hecho" [...] was also released and features additional songwriting by Jorge Drexler. Musically, [...] "Did It Again" [...] is a midtempo electropop song that contains elements of samba. The lyrics of the song are confessional in nature and express Shakira's growing guilt over the fact that she is in a sexual affair with a married man, and her inability to end it, hence the title [...] "Did It Again".|$|E
500|$|It was {{confirmed}} in 2008 that Spears {{was in the}} process of recording her sixth studio album. Spears manager Larry Rudolph confirmed the singer would spend [...] "her summer in the recording studio" [...] to work on it. Despite no official album confirmation at the time, Rudolph revealed they were happy with her progress and that she had been working with a range of producers, such as Sean Garrett, Guy Sigsworth, Danja and Bloodshy & Avant. [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] was written by Spears and Nicole Morier during Summer and Spring of 2008. Among the songs they worked on were [...] "Mmm Papi", [...] "Rock Me In" [...] and [...] "Whiplash".

500|$|A New York Times {{article by}} Peter De Jonge {{explained}} that [...] "The West Wing is never plotted {{out for more}} than a few weeks ahead and has no major story lines", which De Jonge believed was because [...] "with characters who have no flaws, it is impossible to give them significant arcs". Sorkin has stated: [...] "I seldom plan ahead, not because I don't think it's good to plan ahead, there just isn't time." [...] Sorkin has also said, [...] "As a writer, I don't like to answer questions until the very moment that I have to." [...] The Seattle Post-Intelligencers TV critic John Levesque has commented that Sorkin's writing process [...] "can make for ill-advised plot developments". Further complicating the matter, in television, Sorkin will have a hand in writing every episode, rarely letting other writers earn full credit on a script. Peter De Jonge has reported that ex-writers of The West Wing have claimed that [...] "even by the spotlight-hogging standards of Hollywood, Sorkin has been exceptionally ungenerous in his sharing of writing credit". In a comment to GQ magazine in 2008, Sorkin said, [...] "I'm helped by a staff of people who have <b>great</b> <b>ideas,</b> but the scripts aren't written by committee." ...|$|E
