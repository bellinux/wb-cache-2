50|$|In 1995, the <b>ECDL</b> <b>certification</b> {{programme}} {{was developed}} through {{a task force}} of the Council of European Professional Informatics Societies (CEPIS) and was recommended by the European Commission High Level Group, ESDIS, to be a Europe-wide certification scheme. The task force compared several national certification schemes and chose the CDL from Finland {{as the basis for}} piloting and later adoption into the ECDL.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{monitoring}} exercise whose objectives were to analyze the experiences of the Italian Universities in the framework of the ECDL programme and {{to assess the impact of}} the <b>ECDL</b> <b>certification</b> in the Universities. Our investigation focused on the ECDL projects carried out by 50 Universities in the year 2004. The analysis has shown that the <b>ECDL</b> <b>certification</b> was used by the majority of the Universities to assess the basic computer skills of their students. On the contrary, the organizational and teaching profiles of the Universities varied as a function of their size...|$|E
30|$|According to Lazarinis (2006), {{the origin}} of the <b>ECDL</b> <b>certification</b> goes back to 1994 through a European {{initiative}} which aims at the establishment of a certification for basic IT skills. At the beginning, that certification was called Computer Driving License (CDL); now it is named ECDL and is globally recognized as the certification which holds the larger market share compared to other certifications (Weiss and Sellin 2006). Lazarinis also reviewed other information and communication technology (ICT) certifications of private organizations and universities, such as the Microsoft Office User Specialist (MOS; [URL] and the Cambridge International IT Skills ([URL] and pointed out the importance of the ICT certifications as they make employees stay current with new technologies and help them in a job-relevant situation.|$|E
50|$|<b>ECDL</b> / ICDL <b>certification</b> is a {{globally}} recognised {{information and}} communication technology (ICT) and digital literacy qualification. Other than the name, {{there is no difference}} between ECDL and ICDL and they are recognised as equivalent. According to ECDL Foundation, over 14 million people in over 100 countries had registered as candidates for ECDL.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent decades}} Health Informatics {{has become an}} {{increasingly}} important discipline for the adequate and efficient operation of health organisations. Nowadays, the most relevant focus of this discipline has evolved from the computerised medical devices to the management of data, information, documents and above all processes. In this light, the <b>ECDL</b> Health <b>certification</b> proposes a broad and deep set of competences, {{in order to make}} health operators ready to face the complexity of health services. The authors of this study, external verifiers for testing the certification in Italy, analyse the most important problems connected to professional requirements in Health Informatics. In addition, the article presents some field results, emerged from a large training activity in a local public health enterprise in the Italian city of Benevento...|$|R
40|$|The European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) {{programme}} aims at testing {{practical skills}} and competencies in using ICT tools. This paper {{presents the results}} of a monitoring exercise aimed at analyzing the impact of the ECDL programme in the Italian Universities. The ECDL programme, adopted in most Italian Universities since the year 2000, has involved several tens of thousands of students. Our investigation focused on the experiences of the Universities in the year 2003 and, in particular, on the organizational and teaching issues addressed for the implementation of the programme. The analysis has shown that the implementation relied on a large variety of choices about what concerns the teaching organization, the credits awarded to the students and the type of <b>ECDL</b> <b>certification</b> required. These choices varied {{as a function of the}} size of the Universities, whereas their geographical location did not seem to have any influence.
