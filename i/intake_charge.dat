25|$|Nitrous oxide {{is stored}} as a {{compressed}} liquid; the evaporation {{and expansion of}} liquid nitrous oxide in the intake manifold causes a large drop in <b>intake</b> <b>charge</b> temperature, resulting in a denser charge, further allowing more air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder.

2500|$|A {{secondary}} effect of increased duration {{can be increased}} overlap, which {{is the number of}} crankshaft degrees during which both intake and exhaust valves are off their seats. It is overlap which most affects idle quality, inasmuch as the [...] "blow-through" [...] of the <b>intake</b> <b>charge</b> immediately back out thru the exhaust valve which occurs during overlap reduces engine efficiency, and is greatest during low RPM operation. In general, increasing a camshaft's duration typically increases the overlap, unless the intake and exhaust lobe centers are moved apart to compensate.|$|E

50|$|An {{intercooler}} is any {{mechanical device}} used to cool a fluid, including liquids or gases, between {{stages of a}} multi-stage compression process, typically a heat exchanger that removes waste heat in a gas compressor. They are used in many applications, including air compressors, air conditioners, refrigerators, and gas turbines, and are widely known in automotive use as an air-to-air or air-to-liquid cooler for forced induction (turbocharged or supercharged) internal combustion engines to improve their volumetric efficiency by increasing <b>intake</b> air <b>charge</b> density through nearly isobaric (constant pressure) cooling.|$|R
40|$|Absorption {{spectroscopy}} of the OH molecule {{was used}} to examine the light-load limit of the HCCI combustion process. Optical results were compared to cylinder pressure and emissions data, with a focus on the transition from low to high engine-out CO emissions. The goal of the work was to experimentally verify a low-load emissions limit to practical HCCI combustion that has been predicted by detailed kinetic simulations. Two diluent mixtures were used along with 100 % air to create <b>intake</b> <b>charges</b> with varying specific heats in order to highlight the temperature dependence of OH formation. Peak OH concentration data show a correlation with temperature, which agrees with theory. In general, OH absorption decreased monotonically with the mass of fuel injected per cycle for all diluent cases. The absorption spectra, which were taken with 400 ?s time resolution (~ 1. 8 CAD at 600 RPM) show that OH forms during the secondstage heat release and remains in the cylinder well into the expansion stroke. Spectral resolution did not allow a temperature measurement from absorption, so temperature was measured separately. Emissions data showed low exhaust CO concentrations at high fuel rates, and higher CO concentrations at low fueling rates. Qualitatively, the detection limit for OH coincided with the onset of increased engine-out CO emissions and the transition from strong to weak second stage heat release. These data suggest that the three phenomena are linked. As increased CO emissions are the practical limitation to the light-load operation of the HCCI engine, this transition is the light-load limit. Due to noise issues in the temperature data, the temperatures at which these transitions happened could not be determined exactly...|$|R
50|$|A {{decrease}} in intake air charge temperature sustains {{use of a}} more dense <b>intake</b> <b>charge</b> into the engine, {{as a result of}} forced induction. The lowering of the <b>intake</b> <b>charge</b> air temperature also eliminates the danger of pre-detonation (knock) of the fuel/air charge prior to timed spark ignition. This preserves the benefits of more fuel/air burn per engine cycle, increasing the output of the engine.|$|E
50|$|Water has a {{very high}} heat of vaporization. As the ambient {{temperature}} water is injected into the engine, heat transfers from the hot cylinder head and intake air into the water. This makes it evaporate, cooling the <b>intake</b> <b>charge.</b> A cooler <b>intake</b> <b>charge</b> means it is more dense (higher volumetric efficiency) and also has a lower tendency to knock. However, the water vapor displaces some air, negating some of the denser <b>intake</b> <b>charge</b> benefit. Knocking is generally {{more of a problem}} in forced induction engines rather than naturally aspirated, so this can help prevent it. On electronic ignition systems the ignition timing is generally retarded to prevent knock from occurring but with water injection it can be advanced closer to maximum brake torque (MBT) timing for additional power.|$|E

40|$|This thesis work {{relates to}} an {{intended}} improvement of volumetric efficiency, particularly on lower engine speeds, {{in a direct}} injection turbo charged gasoline engine. It {{has been known for}} a long period of time that heat transfer rate in flow components, such as intake system can have considerable effects on mass flow and consequently volumetric efficiency. There are several ways to enhance the amount of air flowing thru an engine, such as increasing size of intake and exhaust geometries. The modification that will be implemented in this project is not supposed to increase the volume of air that will flow thru the engine, but to a certain extent increase the mass flow of it. This is achieved by decreased intake air temperature which results in increased density and hence increased mass flow of the incoming <b>intake</b> air <b>charge.</b> The area of investigation in this thesis project relates to the fact that heat builds up in the cylinder head and transfers to the intake ports surfaces making them very hot. The main objective is to study how a decreased temperature of the intake ports surfaces influences the temperature of the incoming intake air. To efficiently accomplish such a study, a technical solution which intends to reduce heat transfer to the intake ports surfaces must be developed and isolated intake ports are one example of such a solution. The expected outcome of this solution is that the surface temperatures in the intake ports will be reduced and consequently heat transfer to the incoming <b>intake</b> air <b>charge</b> is reduced to a certain extent. The primary aim of the thesis project is to develop a technical solution that with a great amount prevent heat from transferring to the intake ports surfaces. The secondary aim of this study is to investigate how decreased surface temperature in the intake ports influences the incoming <b>intake</b> air <b>charge</b> temperature. Finally, the results will be compared against measured data, obtained from an identical standard single cylinder head. The intention of reducing the surface temperature in the intake ports is to hopefully answer some questions such as were the highest amount of heat transfer occurs in the intake port, if it mostly occurs over the entire intake port or predominantly near the hot intake valves. The results from the GT-Power engine simulations showed that isolated intake ports obtained a reduced surface temperature in the intake ports. That substantially led to a decreased temperature of the incoming intake air, particularly on lower engine speeds. In the single cylinder experiments it was found that the isolated intake ports were a possible method to reduce the temperature of the incoming intake air. Thus, the result did not become as positive as was indicated from the results of the theoretical simulations. To conclude, the major drawback was experienced during experiment testing, there it was noticed that the standard intake ports did not heat the incoming intake air as much as was expected. This consequently resulted that the initial improvement potential of isolated intake ports influence on intake air was not as great as what is expected from the beginning of the thesis...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{emissions}} of nitrogen oxides and particulates from diesel engines, exhaust gas recirculation, EGR, combined with water injection into the exhaust is proposed and has been evaluated using a pre-camber engine. In this method, exhaust gas in which particulates were separated by water injection is fed into the <b>intake</b> air <b>charge.</b> The results show that exhaust black smoke is decreased remarkably by injecting water into the exhaust strearn, and it is expected that a greater black smoke reduction might be attained with less amount of water with finer atomization and better distribution. In the case of the combination of water injection and EGR, simultaneous reduction of NO and black smoke can be achieved at low load condition. At higher load, however, black smoke deteriorates with increasing the amount of recirculated gas due to the decreasing of oxygen concentration in the intake gas, so that EGR rate should be kept at low level for the purification of diesel exhaust...|$|R

If adult height is set by the balance between food <b>intake</b> and <b>charges</b> to disease in early childhood, it is informative about economic and epidemiological conditions in childhood. Because taller populations are better-off, more productive, and live longer, the relationship between childhood conditions and adult height has become an important focus {{in the study of the}} relationship between health and wealth. Here I follow one of the tributaries of this main stream. A relationship between income and height at the individual level has implications for the effects of income inequality on the distribution of heights.

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines fueled by hydrogen {{are among the}} most efficient means of converting chemical energy to mechanical work. The exhaust has near-zero carbon emissions and fuel efficiency exceeding fuel cells is achievable. Unfortunately, the fuel costs are high and efficient combustion of hydrogen in engines produces nitrogen oxides (NOx) that cannot be treated with conventional three-way catalysts. This work presents the results of experiments which consider changes in hydrogen engine design and/or operating strategy to improve engine performance, consisting primarily of engine efficiency and NOx emissions. Various combustion chamber designs, compression ratios, operating parameters, and injector nozzles were tested, and the relative gains found ranged from 0 to 5 %. Three research areas were considered in greater detail to reduce NOx emissions and improve hydrogen engine efficiencies. The first effort focused on injecting liquid water into a cylinder filled with a premixed fuel-air charge. The results were compared against expectations for a conventionally operated hydrogen engine. Using this approach of direct injection of water into the cylinder, NOx emissions were reduced by up to 95 %. At a threshold of 100 ppm of NOx, peak load possible increased by 17. 3 %. The second research area considered injecting water into the <b>intake</b> air <b>charge.</b> With water injection into the <b>intake</b> air <b>charge,</b> the NOx emissions were reduced by 87 %. At a threshold of 90 ppm of NOx, peak load possible increased by 23. 9 %. Finally, experimental data were generated and analyzed for a combustion chamber with two spark plugs. An injector was designed to preferentially stratify the fuel towards the ignition sites. Results from a metal engine and an optically accessible engine are presented. Based on the metal engine data, the new cylinder head design produced a remarkable 47. 7 % net indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) while producing only 51 ppm of NOx. Laser induced fluorescence was used in the optically accessible engine to visualize the fuel distribution during non-firing operation. The most optimal injection conditions (based on the metal engine results) showed a fuel distribution where the equivalence ratio is approximately 0. 65 near the ignition locations...|$|R

40|$|Within this {{research}} project a low-noise air-blower was developed, which under maximum power produces a volume-flow of 730 m" 3 /h and a {{sound power level}} of 97 dB(A). Near the operator's ear, a sound power level of 85 dB(A) is not exceeded. Therefore, compared to ordinary blowers with the same volume-flow, this low-noise blower shows a reduced noise-emission of more than 10 dB(A). This noise-reducement was possible through technical advancement of some components. The rotational speed was lowered by more than 1000 min"-" 1 without reducing the produced volume - flow. The below listed measures were proceeded: increase of motor-power through tuned <b>intake</b> pressure <b>charging,</b> development of inlet and muffler silencer as Helmholtz resonator, avoidance of sharp edges in the ventilator's inside, enlargement of tongue radius, increase of relation of obstacles in the flow to casing.

40|$|Measurement of real driving {{emissions}} (RDE) from {{internal combustion}} engines under real-world operation using portable, onboard monitoring systems (PEMS) is becoming an increasingly important tool aiding {{the assessment of the}} effects of new fuels and technologies on environment and human health. The knowledge of exhaust flow is one of the prerequisites for successful RDE measurement with PEMS. One of the simplest approaches for estimating the exhaust flow from virtually any engine is its computation from the intake air flow, which is calculated from measured engine rpm and <b>intake</b> manifold <b>charge</b> pressure and temperature using a generic speed-density algorithm, applicable to most contemporary four-cycle engines. In this work, a generic speed-density algorithm was compared against several reference methods on representative European production engines - a gasoline port-injected automobile engine, two turbocharged diesel automobile engines, and a heavy-duty turbocharged diesel engine. The overall results suggest that the uncertainty of the generic speed-density method is on the order of 10 % throughout most of the engine operating range, but increasing to tens of percent where high-volume exhaust gas recirculation is used. For non-EGR engines, such uncertainty is acceptable for many simpler and screening measurements, and may be, where desired, reduced by engine-specific calibration...|$|R

The introduction of natural gas into the intake port of a diesel engine usually results in some fuel slipping into the exhaust port due to valve overlap. By analysing the simulation results, the injection strategy that significantly decreases the natural gas slip is defined.

Particularly in both Diesel and SI lean-burn engines NOx emissions are the key pollutants to deal with and sophisticated Engine Management System (EMS) strategies and after-treatment devices have to be applied. In this context, the in-cylinder oxygen mass fraction plays a key-role due its direct influence on the NOx formation mechanism. Real-time estimation of the <b>intake</b> O 2 <b>charge</b> enhances the NOx prediction during engine transients, suitable for both dynamic adjustments of EMS strategies and management of after-treatment devices.

The paper analyzes the air intake process and the influence of the exhaust gas recirculation system based on a mean value modeling approach. All variables required are available at EMS level, thus allowing an on-board implementation without extra costs for additional sensors. The accuracy of the developed estimator is assessed by comparing simulated and experimental trajectories of O 2 concentration, measured by a Universal Exhaust Gas Oxygen (UEGO) sensor located in the intake manifold.
