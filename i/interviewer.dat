30|$|An {{analysis}} of support by interviewed farmers identified some minor differences, which {{were statistically significant}} at p <  0.05. Namely, of the <b>interviewers</b> who interacted only with rain-fed farmers, two (<b>interviewers</b> # 10 and # 14) reported five farmers who did not receive support while the other five <b>interviewers</b> identified either one or none of their respondents who reported an absence of support. With respect to the <b>interviewers</b> who interacted {{with a mix of}} rain-fed and irrigation farmers, two (<b>interviewers</b> # 8 and # 14) reported 14 and 9 farmers respectively without aid while the remaining five <b>interviewers</b> reported two or fewer farmers without any acknowledged aid. In total, only 40 of the 466 farmers interviewed reported that they did not receive support of any kind. The similarities in these observations suggest that <b>interviewers,</b> on average, were quite consistent with the types of responses they received, an indication that either all of the <b>interviewers</b> or none of the <b>interviewers</b> introduced bias into the farmers’ responses.|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{will present}} and test a model linking actual applicant-interviewer demographic, human capital, and cultural capital similarity to an <b>interviewer??s</b> recommendation to hire. Actual similarity is proposed to influence an <b>interviewer??s</b> perceptions of similarity with an applicant. These perceptions, in turn, {{lead to the}} <b>interviewer??s</b> perceptions of the applicant??s Person-Organization (PO) fit and the applicant??s Person-Job (PJ) fit. Two main mechanisms are proposed to mediate the relationship between an <b>interviewer??s</b> perceptions of similarity and an <b>interviewer??s</b> perceptions of an applicant??s fit: liking and negative behavioral expectations. Lastly, both an <b>interviewer??s</b> PO and PJ fit perceptions of an applicant are posited to influence the <b>interviewer??s</b> recommendation to hire. A total of 118 interviewer-applicant dyads contacted through the Career Center Office at a University located in the southwestern United States participated in the study. Results partially support the model. An <b>interviewer??s</b> perceptions of similarity with an applicant are positively related to an <b>interviewer??s</b> fit evaluations. An <b>interviewer??s</b> negative behavioral expectations of an applicant mediate this relationship. Furthermore, perceived similarity is positively related to an <b>interviewer??s</b> liking of an applicant. In turn, liking is positively related to an <b>interviewer??s</b> PO fit perceptions. However, liking does not function as a mediator between perceived similarity and fit evaluations. Finally, fit evaluations are positively related to hiring recommendations. I discuss the main implications of the study as well as strengths, limitations, and future research...|$|R
50|$|An applicant’s knowledge, skills, abilities, {{and other}} {{attributes}} (KSAOs) {{are the most}} commonly measured variables when <b>interviewers</b> assess Person-job fit. In one survey, all <b>interviewers</b> reported that their organization measures KSAOs to determine Person-job fit. The same study found that all <b>interviewers</b> used personality traits and 65% of the <b>interviewers</b> used personal values to measure Person-organization fit.|$|R

40|$|<b>Interviewers</b> given prior {{information}} are biassed to seek it from interviewees. We examined whether the detrimental {{impact of this}} confirmation bias in terms of leading question use was moderated by interviewers&# 039; demonstrated ability to adhere to open questions. We classified interviewers&# 039; adherence as &# 039;good&# 039; or &# 039;poor&# 039; in an independent interview before they interviewed children about a staged event. Half the <b>interviewers</b> were given biassing true and false information about the event; half were given no information. As predicted, only poor <b>interviewers</b> showed the effect of bias. Poor <b>interviewers</b> asked fewer open questions in the biassed condition than the non-biassed condition; good <b>interviewers</b> asked the same (high) proportion of open questions in both conditions. Poor <b>interviewers</b> asked more leading questions in the biassed condition than the non-biassed condition; good <b>interviewers</b> asked the same (low) proportion of leading questions in both conditions. These results demonstrate that interviewers&# 039; skill in adhering to open questions reduces the detrimental impact of confirmation bias on question type...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{whether the}} interviewers' {{political}} opinions {{have an influence}} on those of the respondents. The research uses data from a panel survey in which <b>interviewers</b> are randomly assigned to respondents. The {{results show that the}} respondents express significantly similar opinions to those of the <b>interviewers</b> in all questions considered. Multilevel models show that more educated respondents are affected to a slightly higher extent and that the <b>interviewer's</b> experience is also a factor. There is no difference between different respondent subgroups or when both <b>interviewers</b> and respondents share the same socio-demographic characteristics. While there is no evidence for respondents wanting to please the <b>interviewers,</b> the hypothesis of socially desirable behavior can indeed be confirmed...|$|R

40|$|Consistent with {{previous}} findings, interviewers' postinterview evaluations of applicants for correction officer positions were {{positively related to}} preinterview information on the applicants. The <b>interviewer's</b> conduct of the interview appeared to mediate this effect {{in a manner consistent}} with the behavioral confirmation predictions of a process model of the interview (Dipboye, 1982). Individual differences among <b>interviewers</b> were found in the extent to which they used preinterview information in reaching their decisions. Additionally, the instructions which <b>interviewers</b> were provided with appeared to play a role in the manner in which <b>interviewers</b> rendered their ratings about applicants on ten interview dimensions...|$|R

For a photo shoot, Rama Rao lent Venkateswara Rao his coat and placed a tilaka on his forehead. Allu Ramalingaiah was cast as the comic teacher-cum-ayurvedic-doctor Panthulu.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{share the}} {{experience}} of working with people with intellectual disabilities (ID) as <b>interviewers</b> in a qualitative study about community participation of people with ID. We reflect on two perspectives: the <b>interviewers</b> and the researchers. Method: Eighteen people with ID were interviewed by their peers about participation. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and results and experiences were discussed in a focus group with the <b>interviewers</b> and workers of a self-advocacy group. Results: Using trained peer <b>interviewers</b> can help people with ID in sharing meaningful experiences and can {{improve the quality of}} research. The <b>interviewers</b> provided a safe environment and were likely to understand or to be understood by the respondents, as they share common experiences. In addition, first results show that the <b>interviewers</b> have personally benefitted from participation in research in terms of increased self-confidence, improved communication skills and expanded friendships. <b>Interviewers</b> with ID are able to perform well under the right conditions (e. g. opportunities to practice, clear information, and an adequate and flexible approach). Conclusions: Actively involving people with ID in research, armed with good training, adds value to the richness and relevance of research findings. It also increases the visibility and empowerment of persons with ID...|$|R
40|$|Researchers who {{conducted}} 194 personal interview surveys of low-income popula-tions returned mail questionnaires about {{their experience with}} middle- and lower-class <b>interviewers.</b> Interviewing poor people is {{not as difficult as}} expected; receptivity and completion rates are generally good. The second part of the questionnaire focussed on indigenous <b>interviewers,</b> i. e., those matched to respondents by class and race/ethnicity. Compared to black or white middle-class <b>interviewers,</b> indigenous <b>interviewers</b> are rated least adequate on performance of most interviewing tasks, such as asking ques-tions and recording answers. Their main strengths are contacting, locating, and estab-lishing rapport with respondents. Additional education and interviewing experience improve performance ratings but additional training does not. Despite performance problems, researchers who chose to employ indigenous <b>interviewers</b> usually plan to do so in future surveys. The interview survey with low-income populations was one of the growth industries of the late 1960...|$|R

40|$|Survey {{data are}} {{potentially}} affected by cheating <b>interviewers.</b> Even {{a small number}} of fabricated interviews might seriously impair the results of further empirical analysis. Besides reinterviews some statistical approaches have been proposed for identifying fabrication of interviews. As a novel tool in this context, cluster and discriminant analysis are used. Several indicators are combined to classify "at risk" <b>interviewers</b> based solely on the collected data. An application to a dataset with known cases of cheating <b>interviewers</b> demonstrates that the methods are able to identify the cheating <b>interviewers</b> with a high probability.

40|$|Job {{satisfaction}} and burnout among social workers is well-documented in the literature, {{yet there is}} a paucity of research in this area pertaining to forensic <b>interviewers.</b> Forensic <b>interviewers,</b> specially trained professionals who conduct structured interviews with children who have made allegations regarding abuse, may be particularly vulnerable to burnout {{as a result of their}} work. A cross-sectional electronic survey design was used to gather information from 148 forensic <b>interviewers</b> associated with Children 2 ̆ 7 s Advocacy Centers (CAC) located in the Northeast region of the United States. While the quantitative and qualitative findings of this research indicate forensic <b>interviewers</b> are satisfied with their work, a substantial number are experiencing burnout. Control was found to have a positive relationship with job satisfaction. Having a flexible schedule, developing skills in supervision, and training junior forensic <b>interviewers</b> are ways <b>interviewers</b> are provided with control. Job {{satisfaction and}} support were both found to have inverse relationships with burnout. Flexibility, in addition to relationships with supervisors and coworkers, are ways organizations provided a supportive work environment. This study supports the effects of control and support in relation to job satisfaction and burnout, as suggested by the job-demands control (support) model. Given that social work was the most common field of study among participants, social workers affiliated with CACs are well-positioned to incorporate the findings of this study into practice to benefit forensic <b>interviewers</b> and the clients they serve. The suggested policy and practice implications will enhance organizational support, increase job satisfaction, and reduce burnout which will lead to a stronger workforce. Such implications impact children – and in the largest sense, society as a whole – as forensic <b>interviewers</b> will be more effective. Considering the growth of this specialized field of practice, the research will influence organizations to develop policies that mitigate the conditions associated with burnout among forensic <b>interviewers...</b>|$|R
5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the <b>interviewer</b> uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E
