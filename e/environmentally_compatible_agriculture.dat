40|$|Regarding <b>environmentally</b> <b>compatible</b> entrepreneurship, {{there are}} {{contradictory}} opinions, {{as to whether}} it is possible or not to realize it. According to one reasoning, entrepreneurship development is not compatible to environmental protection. On the other hand, another reasoning, which is rather more constructive and progressive, introduces the terms of bearing ability, application to the production of <b>environmentally</b> <b>compatible</b> technologies and use of equable forms of energy.

The invention provides a new process, which reduce nitrogen and sulfur oxides by carbonyl sulfide over suitable catalysts to nitrogen and high purity elemental sulfur at low temperature. Lowering the reaction temperature of the reactions has enormous advantages in terms of savings in capital investment and operational costs. The process is novel and single-stage.
