50|$|Bedding {{increases}} {{accuracy in}} part by relieving stress on the action. The rifle's action will rarely sit flush in the stock without bedding. This causes the action to flex when tightening the bolts holding the action to the stock. The flexing results {{in a loss of}} accuracy. Bedding will create a <b>flush</b> <b>surface</b> for the action and prevent flexing. Bedding also reduces movement of the action in the stock. Without bedding, the action {{may be more likely to}} shift after a shot. If the action shifts and does not return to same spot in the stock the rifle will lose the ability to maintain zero.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Bonded scarf repairs {{are used}} in {{composite}} structures when high strength recovery is needed or {{when there is a}} requirement for a <b>flush</b> <b>surface</b> to satisfy aerodynamic or stealth requirements. However, scarf repairs are complex to design and require the removal of significant parent structure, particularly for thick skins. In this investigation, analytical and numerical approaches have been developed to investigate whether an optimum repair shape for a known biaxial load can be determined. The results clearly demonstrate that the strength of a repaired panel can be improved by optimising both the initial damage cut-out shape and the scarf angle distribution...|$|E
40|$|Bonded {{composite}} scarf repairs {{are often}} used when a <b>flush</b> <b>surface</b> is required for aerodynamic or stealth reasons. Such repairs on the external surface of an aircraft {{are subject to the}} same impact risk as that of the parent structure. Consequently, it is essential to assess their durability in the case of impact. A previous preliminary experimental study found an instance of catastrophic failure of a composite scarf joint subject to impact whilst prestrained to 3000 μ. It was postulated that this phenomenon is a result of failure in the joint due to the combination of the prestrain and global structural oscillations resulting from the impact event. In this investigation, a previously applied finite element model is extended to more accurately replicate such catastrophic failure. The effect of lay-up sequence on adhesive failure is studied...|$|E
40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Refill Friction Stir Spot Joining (RFSJ) {{developed}} by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) is a derivative technology of friction stir spot welding for joining aerospace aluminum alloys. The aerospace aluminum alloys were previously considered not weldable using conventional fusion welding methods. RFSJ does not consume any filler materials so that no additional weight is introduced to the assembly. As the solid-to-liquid phase transition {{is not involved in}} RFSJ in general, there is no lack of fusion or material deterioration caused by liquefaction and solidification. Unlike the conventional friction stir spot welding, RFSJ produces a spot joint with a perfectly <b>flush</b> <b>surface</b> finish without a key/exit hole. KHI has advanced the original friction stir spot welding concept and developed a robotic system that is capable of producing refill friction stir spot joints. The goal {{of this study is to}} demonstrate process parameter optimization of RFSJ for baseline aerospace aluminum alloys.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the measurement of skin friction, the least under-stood component of drag. Skin friction is considered the “last frontier ” in drag redu c-tion for supersonic flight, but to understand skin friction, it must be accurately mea s-ured. This study utilized the direct measuring technique for skin friction. A small de-vice, termed a skin friction gage, measures the stress on a cantilever beam topped with a movable surface piece as a shear flow passes over the <b>flush</b> <b>surface.</b> The improv e-ment of these devices for various flow fields is ongoing. A problem that arose with many designs was leakage of a gap-filling liquid. The typical direct measuring skin friction gage uses oil in a gap between the cantilever beam and the encasement to dampen vibrations, to create an even flow over the surface, and for temperature co m-pensation. In high speed testing the oil leaks out; therefore, a gage with rubber to fill the gap instead of oil was introduced. This study employed a finite element method model to fully understand the strains involved with the rubber and the skin friction gage. The development of a cali-bration device, called the Calibration Rig, for the rubber skin friction gages was con...|$|E
40|$|Two {{stainless}} steel toilets using the 1. 6 gallon per flush valve were tested and are documented in this report. One toilet is {{a version of}} the existing TDC water closet design (designated TDC 5) and represents a retrofit by changing the flush valve from 4. 0 gallons to 1. 6 gallons and modifying the rinse ring holes. TDC 5 is intended for use within the Texas prison system only and does not satisfy the performance requirements of the ASME Standard at the specified operating pressure of 35 psi static. However, by raising the operating pressure to 65 psi static, all performance criteria specified in ASME Standard A 112. 19. 6 - 1990 are met. The second toilet tested is the new prototype toilet (designated ATM 7). This toilet is designed to meet all requirements as specified in the ASME Standard and is intended for use in new prison facilities. This toilet passed all performance criteria stated in the ASME Standard when operating with the 1. 6 gallon flush valve at a static water pressure of 35 psi. However performance was very marginal and much improvement is possible. The flush line entrance diameter reduction to 1 / 4 " is too restrictive and forces an excessive amount of water to the rinse ring. A larger flush line entrance diameter is needed, to enhance the removal of solids without degrading the <b>flush</b> <b>surface</b> rinse performance...|$|E

40|$|Flushing is an {{important}} maintenance task that removes accumulated particles in microirrigation laterals that can help to reduce clogging problems. The effect of three dripline flushing frequency treatments (no flushing, one flushing {{at the end of}} each irrigation period, and a monthly flushing during the irrigation period) was studied in surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems that operated using a wastewater treatment plant effluent for three irrigation periods of 540 h each. The irrigation systems had two different emitters, one pressure compensating and the other not, both molded and welded onto the interior dripline wall, placed in laterals 87 m long. Dripline flow of the pressure compensating emitter increased 8 % over time, while in the nonpressure compensating emitter, dripline flow increased 25 % in the surface driplines and decreased 3 % in the subsurface driplines by the emitter clogging. Emitter clogging was affected primarily by the interactions between emitter location, emitter type, and flushing frequency treatment. The number of completely clogged emitters was affected by the interaction between irrigation system and emitter type. There was an average of 3. 7 % less totally clogged emitters in <b>flushed</b> <b>surface</b> driplines with the pressure compensating emitter as compared to flushed subsurface laterals with the nonpressure compensating emitter. <b>Flushing</b> Wastewater <b>Surface</b> drip irrigation Subsurface drip irrigation Plugging...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{enhancements}} in structural adhesives technology {{enabled the}} use of adhesive joints and repairs in several industrial fields. The scarf repair is the most efficient because of suppression of peel (σ) and shear (τ) peak stresses, arising from the tapered adherend edges. The repair of structures that have the requirement of <b>flush</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{is one of the}} major applications of the scarf geometry. This work is a numerical study on the ultimate tensile strength of two-dimensional (2 D) scarf repairs of aluminum structures with external doublers as reinforcements. Two adhesives were considered: the brittle epoxy Araldite® AV 138 and the ductile epoxy Araldite® 2015 (Huntsmann, Basel, Switzerland). The numerical analysis by finite elements (FE) was performed in Abaqus® (Dassault Systèmes, Vélizy-Villacoublay, France) and used cohesive zone models (CZM), thus enabling the strength prediction of the repairs. Validation of this methodology with scarf repair experiments was performed previously. The influence of the main reinforcement geometric parameters is studied for the two adhesives, such as doubler thickness and edge geometry. This work enabled to conclude that the repairs’ strength can be optimized by a significant amount by a careful selection of the doubler geometry, and that the results are dependent on the adhesive ductility. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
