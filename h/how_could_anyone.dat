In the same newspaper, on the following day, Keith Watson commented that the episode [...] "was like watching Carry On Up the Asteroids", but nevertheless stated that [...] "as dramatic cocktails go, [...] was out of this world", and gave the episode four stars out of five. The Times commented that the episode was [...] "good, salacious, knockabout fun", the best thing about Torchwood that [...] "everyday Cardiff hums alongside psychotic blowfish and time loops", and asked [...] "when extraterrestrial push comes to intergalactic shove, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> object to a series that begins with a blowfish driving a sports car?". The Guardian stated that parts were [...] "very, very, funny" [...] and the episode was largely [...] "a hoot". However, The Daily Telegraph felt that the series fared better on BBC Three, but on BBC Two it was [...] "both far too pleased with itself and surprisingly amateurish".|$|E

The question terrified her and was unanswerable. She sought refuge in Gudrun's natural, proud indifference.|$|E

5000|$|Speaking in May 2001 in {{response}} to allegations that NITEL had executed inflated contracts, a NITEL spokesman said Arzika [...] "is the only minister ... that has not bothered to influence any decision in the company, so <b>how</b> then <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> allege {{that he was in}} the know how?"In June 2001 Arzika resigned from the cabinet.

60|$|He {{could not}} help it. The thought would not leave him that all this might exist without. How did he know? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> be sure, quite sure?

It was Satan that stood whispering in his ear, Satan lying in wait for his soul; let him deny God {{and he would be}} damned for ever.|$|E
6000|$|He {{returned}} to his former preoccupation with the Council's possible intentions. He began to reconsider the details of Howard's behaviour, sinister glances, inexplicable hesitations. Then, for a time, his mind circled {{about the idea of}} escaping from these rooms; but whither could he escape into this vast, crowded world? He would be worse off than a Saxon yeoman suddenly dropped into nineteenth century London. And besides, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> escape from these rooms? ...|$|E
60|$|Again Helen felt {{a quality}} of inevitableness in Bo. It was {{something}} that had appeared only practical in the humdrum home life in St. Joseph. All of a sudden Helen received a flash of wondering thought--a thrilling consciousness that she and Bo had begun to develop {{in a new and}} wild environment. How strange, and fearful, perhaps, to watch that growth! Bo, being younger, more impressionable, with elemental rather than intellectual instincts, would grow stronger more swiftly. Helen wondered if she could yield to her own leaning to the primitive. But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> with a thoughtful and grasping mind yield that way? It was the savage who did not think.|$|E

6000|$|How can I, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>anyone,</b> tell of {{that strange}} scene, its solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror, and withal, its sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can {{see nothing but}} a travesty of bitter truth in {{anything}} holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of her husband's voice, as in tones so broken and emotional that often he had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial of the Dead.

60|$|Once, when I {{leaned over}} the hearth to put fresh logs on the fire, my face {{was so close to}} hers that I felt her breath on my cheek. It thrilled me to feel even the {{suggestion}} of that ineffable contact. Her breath was sweet--sweet as the breath of a calf, sweet as the whiff of a summer breeze across beds of mignonette. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> believe for a moment that such sweet breath could come from the lips of the dead--the dead in esse or in posse--that corruption could send forth fragrance so sweet and pure? It was with satisfied happiness that, as I looked at her from my stool, I saw the dancing of the flames from the beech-logs reflected in her glorious black eyes, and the stars that were hidden in them shine out with new colours and new lustre as they gleamed, rising and falling like hopes and fears. As the light leaped, so did smiles of quiet happiness flit over her beautiful face, the merriment of the joyous flames being reflected in ever-changing dimples.|$|E
60|$|There {{was such}} earnest truth in her tone that the sense and {{realization}} {{of my own}} harshness smote me. In the presence of such love as this even a lover's selfishness must become abashed. I could not express myself in words, so simply raised her slim hand in mine and kissed it. As it lay warm in my own I could not but notice, {{as well as its}} fineness, its strength and the firmness of its clasp. Its warmth and fervour struck into my heart--and my brain. Thereupon I poured out to her once more my love for her, she listening all afire. When passion had had its say, the calmer emotions had opportunity of expression. When I was satisfied afresh of her affection, I began to value her care for my safety, and so I went back to the subject. Her very insistence, based on personal affection, gave me more solid ground for fear. In the moment of love transports I had forgotten, or did not think, of what wonderful power or knowledge she must {{have to be able to}} move in such strange ways as she did. Why, at this very moment she was within my own gates. Locks and bars, even the very seal of death itself, seemed unable to make for her a prison-house. With such freedom of action and movement, going when she would into secret places, what might she not know that was known to others? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> keep secret from such an one even an ill intent? Such thoughts, such surmises, had often flashed through my mind in moments of excitement rather than of reflection, but never long enough to become fixed into belief. But yet the consequences, the convictions, of them were with me, though unconsciously, though the thoughts themselves were perhaps forgotten or withered before development.|$|E

6000|$|I {{should have}} liked {{completely}} to express them, {{in spite of}} the difficulty--if not indeed just by reason of that; the difficulty of their consisting so much more of [...] "character" [...] than of [...] "incident" [...] (heaven save the artless opposition!) though this last element figured bravely enough too, thanks to some of the forms taken by our young Albert's wild wilfulness. He was so weak--after the most approved fashion of distressing young men of means--that his successive exhibitions of it had a fine high positive effect, such as would have served beautifully, act after act, for the descent of the curtain. The issue, however (differing in this from the common theatrical trick) depended less on who should die than on who should live; the younger of cousin Helen's pair of wards--putting them even only as vessels of her attempted earnestness--had violently broken away, but a remedy to this grief, for reasons too many to tell, dwelt in the possible duration, could it only not be arrested, of two other lives, one of these her own, the second the guileless Henry's. The single gentlewomen, to a remarkable number, whom she regarded and treated as nieces, though they were only daughters of cousins, were such objects of her tender solicitude that, she and Henry and Albert being alike childless, the delightful thing to think of was, on certain contingencies, the nieces' prospective wealth. There were contingencies of course--and they exactly produced the pity and terror. Her estate would go at her death to her nearest of kin, represented by her brother and nephew; it would be only of her savings--fortunately, with her kind eye on the gentlewomen, zealous and long continued--that she might dispose by will; and it was but a troubled comfort that, should he be living {{at the time of her}} death, the susceptible Henry would profit no less than the wanton Albert. Henry was at any cost to be kept in life that he might profit; the woeful question, the question of delicacy, for a woman devoutly conscientious, was <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> else, how, above all, could fifteen other persons, be made to profit by his profiting? She had been as earnest a steward of her brother's fortune as if directness of pressure on him, in a sense favourable to her interests--that is to her sympathies, which were her only interests--had been a matter of course with her; whereas in fact she would have held it a crime, given his simplicity, to attempt in the least to guide his hand. If he didn't outlive his nephew--and he was older, though, as would appear, so much more virtuous--his inherited property, she being dead, would accrue to that unedifying person. There was the pity; and as for the question of the disposition of Henry's savings without the initiative of Henry's intelligence, in that, alas, was the terror. Henry's savings--there had been no terror for her, naturally, in beautifully husbanding his resources for him--dangled, naturally, with no small vividness, before the wistful gentlewomen, to whom, if he had but had the initiative, he might have made the most princely presents. Such was the oddity, not to say the rather tragic drollery, of the situation: that Henry's idea of a present was ten cents' worth of popcorn, or some similar homely trifle; and that when one had created for him a world of these proportions there was no honest way of inspiring him to write cheques for hundreds; all congruous though these would be with the generosity of his nature as shown by the exuberance of his popcorn. The ideal solution would be his flashing to intelligence just long enough to apprehend the case and, of his own magnanimous movement, sign away everything; but that was a fairy-tale stroke, and the fairies here somehow stood off.|$|E

The film inspired Hugo and Nebula award-winning author Octavia Butler to begin writing science fiction.
