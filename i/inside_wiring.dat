When a telephone user wants to make a telephone call, equipment at the exchange examines the dialed telephone number and connects that telephone line to another in the same wire center, or to a trunk to a distant exchange. Most of the exchanges in the world are interconnected through a system of larger switching systems, forming the public switched telephone network (PSTN).|$|E

40|$|With the {{downscaling}} of feature dimensions, copper interconnects exhibit properties differing from bulk or film material. Resistivity {{increases and}} limits electrical performances, {{and reliability of}} interconnects becomes a more important challenge for each new technological node. In this study, we present an approach of copper grain growth control <b>inside</b> narrow <b>wires</b> by adding a step between the copper electro-chemical deposition (ECD) and the chemical–mechanical polishing (CMP). This step corresponds to a partial CMP step (pre-CMP) and is applied after ECD and before anneal in order to modify the copper previous termoverburdennext term thickness. Depending on the targeted thickness, copper grain growth occurs during anneal with different efficiencies. Crystallization and grain growth behavior <b>inside</b> <b>wires</b> is investigated with focused ions beam (FIB). We present here our methodology for sample preparation and characterization. Results are focused on electrical variations and on morphological aspects of copper crystallization and grain growth inside lines observed with various overburden thicknesses. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{modeling}} {{of the business}} cases for FTTH has revealed that it is most cost ef-fective to concentrate initial deployments in densely populated areas. That fact, coupled {{with the realization that}} in such dense ar-eas the majority of subscribers live in mul-tiple dwelling units (MDUs), is driving a strong need for FTTH systems optimized for MDU installations. The shared experiences of many leading service providers around the world indi-cate that there are several common goals that must be attained to optimize FTTH deployments to MDUs: reduce up-front in-stallation costs; increase the speed of making a subscriber connection; reduce lifetime op-erating costs; and maximize the reach, split ratio, and subscriber penetration of the network. To achieve the first two goals, operators need hardware that increases the speed and ease of <b>inside</b> <b>wiring</b> installation and reduces labor and material costs as well as the number of loss-related rework events during cable instal-lation. In short, the FTTH industry needs op-tical cables that can be installed and handled in the same robust manner as copper cables. However, as shown in Fig. 1, optical ca-bles treated in this manner can be subjected to tight bends, compression points in con-gested ducts, and stapling. Corning and Ve-rizon have investigated the impact of such installation and handling practices and have determined that the optical fiber can see bends down to 5 mm in radius. 1 As dis-cussed elsewhere 1, fiber macrobend loss of less than 0. 1 dB/ turn at 5 mm is required to keep the inside wir-ing total loss at maximum a few tenths of a deci-bel. Traditional standard sing-lemode fibers subjected to one full (360 °) turn at a 5 -mm bend radius would ex-hibit a loss in ex-cess of 10 dB (see table).

40|$|The Communications Act of 1934 requires, {{among other}} things, that {{telephone}} companies as 2 ̆ 2 common carriers 2 ̆ 2 make their services {{available to the}} general public at affordable rates. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has the authority to classify telephone services as common carriers as well as the ability to remove common carrier regulation to promote competition, satisfy consumer demand for individually tailored offerings, and avoid unnecessary regulatory costs. The Authors of this Article believe that the FCC should remove the common carrier regulation from certain long-distance service contracts and that such regulation is consistent with the deregulatory aims of the recent Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Article first reviews the judicial development of the common carrier definition which finds that a communications service is acting as a carrier if it either (1) actually holds out its service indiscriminately to the public or (2) is required to hold itself out because the public interest requires it. The Authors discuss the relatively broad application of this definition to new and existing telephone services in a series of cases. Part I concludes with an examination of recent instances where the FCC has used this definition to reclassify various telecommunications services as private or noncommon carriers/carriage. These instances fall into five categories: (1) satellite transponders, (2) broadcast-related services, (3) private land mobile services, (4) private microwave services, and (5) certain communications services, such as enhanced services and <b>inside</b> <b>wiring.</b> In Part II the Authors describe the growth and importance of individually negotiated telecommunications service contracts to the business operations of many customers. The Article then discusses the application of the private carrier alternative to these contracts. The Authors argue that there is nothing inherent in these contracts which requires that they be designated as common carrier services. The Authors offer several reasons why the FCC should no longer require that the contract services indiscriminately be held out to the public, including some of the potential benefits of removing this regulation. The Authors feel that classifying the service contracts as private would promote competition and innovation, as well as reduce regulatory costs...|$|E
