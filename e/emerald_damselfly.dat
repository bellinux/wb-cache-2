25|$|Developments in the 20th {{century have}} {{produced}} a marked contrast between the environments {{in the east and}} west of the island. The eastern half of the island is allocated to residential areas, the main public amenities and a small holiday camp and seafront, while the western half of the island is mainly farmland, marshes and industrial areas. The marshes in the west include the 30 hectares known as West Canvey marshes, acquired by the RSPB in 2007, and the Canvey Wick nature reserve. Canvey Wick is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) {{at the site of the}} abandoned and incomplete oil refinery. The foundations of the 100 hectare (0.4 sq mile) site were prepared in the 1970s by laying thousands of tonnes of silt dredged from the Thames; the abandoned and undisturbed area has flourished as a haven for around 1,300 species of wildlife, many of which are endangered or were thought to be extinct; including the shrill carder bee, the <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> and the weevil hunting wasp.|$|E
500|$|Southern <b>Emerald</b> <b>Damselfly,</b> first {{recorded}} at Winterton Dunes, Norfolk on 30 July 2002 (Nobes 2003 [...] ); in 2003 & 2004, the species was again seen here and at Sandwich Bay, Kent (Forrest 2005 [...] ), {{but there have}} been no subsequent sightings at either location.|$|E
500|$|... 3. The {{following}} {{is a list of}} species which have previously been predicted to occur in Britain but have not yet been recorded (see Merritt, Moore & Eversham 1996 [...] pp.113–114 and Parr 1998, [...] 1999 [...] ): Subarctic Hawker Aeshna subarctica, Northern White-faced Darter Leucorrhina rubicunda and Small <b>Emerald</b> <b>Damselfly</b> Lestes virens.|$|E
40|$|Females of the <b>emerald</b> <b>damselflies,</b> Lestes sponsa, L. temporalis and L, japonicus, were {{captured}} in the wild and their reproductive organs were observed. The number of mature eggs was rather constant during their reproductive ages at about 200, 100 and 100 in L. sponsa, L. temporalis and L. japonicus, respectively. The egg maturation seemed to occur continuously after a particular developmental stage of adult female. The mature egg size of L. temporalis was more than two times of that of other species and decreased with age. The realized fecundity {{seemed to be the}} largest in L, sponsa...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the larger}} damselflies, this species is most common in July and August. It is often found by ponds and lakes, and is very rarely seen along flowing water. <b>Emerald</b> <b>Damselflies</b> like to perch among reeds, their colour {{providing}} good camouflage. They are not as strong fliers {{when compared to other}} common damselflies such as the common blue or large red damselflies, but {{they are more likely to}} be seen on misty, rainy days then those species. When disturbed they usually do not fly very far away, landing on another perch a few yards away. Their habit of perching with their wings half open is characteristic of the family Lestidae and gives rise to their other common name of spreadwings. A population can consist of several hundred insects.|$|R
500|$|Willow <b>Emerald</b> <b>Damselfly,</b> since 2007 {{this species}} is {{established}} and spreading in south-east England, especially Suffolk and Essex. It was previously only known {{from a single}} record from Hertfordshire in 1899 (although this record {{is based on a}} specimen regarded by some as perhaps not of British origin, see Gladwin 1997 [...] ) and a single exuvia collected in Kent in 1992 (Brook & Brook 2002, 2004 [...] ).|$|E
50|$|Lestes barbarus is {{a species}} of {{damselfly}} of the family Lestidae, the spreadwings. Its common names in English include southern <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly,</b> shy <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly,</b> and migrant spreadwing.|$|E

50|$|Winterton Dunes is {{also known}} as the first site in Britain where the {{southern}} <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> occurred (Nobes 2003).|$|E
50|$|The shores are {{dominated}} by various species of Oligochaeta, Gastropoda, and Odonata. Superficial sediments {{are dominated}} by Oligochaeta and non-biting midges while deeper layers contain the freshwater crustacean Asellus aquaticus and larvae of mayflies and Odonatas. Gyraulus crista and Hippeutis complanatus are unusual freshwater snails present in the lake. The most common dragonfly is the <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly,</b> but azure damselfly, variable damselfly, scarce <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly,</b> common blue damselfly, downy emerald, and red-eyed damselfly are also present. In Stockholm, Aeshna osiliensis is unique to Norra Djurgården, while the large white-faced darter is protected by the EU.|$|E
50|$|Lestes dryas is {{a species}} of {{damselfly}} in the family Lestidae, the spreadwings. Its common names include emerald spreadwing, scarce <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> and robust spreadwing. An alternate name in Ireland is the turlough spreadwing.|$|E
50|$|Lestes sponsa, is a damselfly, {{with a wide}} Palaearctic distribution. It {{is known}} {{commonly}} as the <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> or common spreadwing. Both males and females have a metallic green colour and when resting its wings are usually half opened.|$|E
50|$|Chalcolestes viridis, {{formerly}} Lestes viridis, is a damselfly of {{the family}} Lestidae. It has a metallic green body and at rest it holds its wings away from its body. Its common name is the willow <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> or the western willow spreadwing.|$|E
50|$|Thousands of anthills of {{the yellow}} meadow ant {{can be found in}} the ancient grasslands of Old Hall Marshes as well as around twenty-four species of butterfly. Dragonflies are also popular in this area which include the scarce <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> and good numbers of ruddy darters.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the other}} members of the Lestes genus both sexes of L. dryas have largely {{metallic}} green bodies with a bronze iridescence. They usually rest with their wings half spread. L.dryas is very similar in appearance to the <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> Lestes sponsa and care must be taken to tell the two species apart.|$|E
50|$|The marshes are {{unimproved}} coastal grassland, dykes and creeks, with a {{wide variety}} of maritime herbs and grasses, some of them nationally rare. The site is the main British location for least lettuce. Insects with restricted distributions include the scarce <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> and Roesel's bush cricket. There are birds at Vange Marsh such as avocets, common terns and black-tailed godwits.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} {{a variety of}} habitats, such as grassland, scrub, reedbed, fen, ponds and saltmarsh. It was {{reclaimed}} in the seventeenth century, when Pitseahall Fleet was excavated to construct sea walls. The Fleet has a large and varied bird population. Dykes and ponds support the scarce <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly,</b> and other rare invertebrates include Roesel's bush-cricket, a harvestman Leiobunum rotundum, a hoverfly xanthandrus comtus, and a ground beetle dyschirius impunctipennis.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{a mixture}} of woodland, scrub and grassland. Most soils in London are acidic, but this site has a very {{alkaline}} soil due to the dumping of fuel ash, and can therefore support locally unusual plants. The most important of these are pyramidal and southern marsh orchids, grey club rush and wild basil. The site also has large numbers of rabbits and goldfinches. Some rare species of insects are present, including <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly.</b>|$|E
50|$|The fauna {{is unusually}} varied, {{including}} the European hare, the European stonechat, the shrike, the diving bell spider and {{many kinds of}} amphibians and reptiles, such as the natterjack toad, northern crested newt and grass snake. Waders and songbirds use the area as a brooding site, raptors use the arable land {{as a source of}} prey, and the entire area has an extremely varied insect population including the scarce blue-tailed damselfly and small <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{valuable}} habitat {{has been}} generated on the Große Aue for {{plants and animals}} typical of water meadows. In the wet biotopes and in the standing and flowing waters there are grass rushes, water violets and blister sedges as well as short-winged coneheads and large marsh grasshoppers. Threatened dragonflies, such as the banded darter, southern <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> live here as do birds like the whitethroat and little grebe. Reed buntings, reed warblers and snipe also occur here.|$|E
50|$|Fry {{of smooth}} newt was {{reported}} in 2000, the only amphibian reported by the lake. An inventory of damselflies in 1997 resulted in a list of <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly,</b> red-eyed damselfly, variable damselfly, southern hawker, brilliant emerald, four-spotted chaser, eastern white-faced darter, and black darter. A second inventory in 2000 produced the following list interpreted as a normal amount of species: common hawker, brown hawker, Irish damselfly, variable damselfly, downy emerald, red-eyed damselfly, northern white-faced darter, brilliant emerald, and black darter.|$|E
50|$|Preferred {{habitats}} of {{this species}} are pools, ponds and moorlands, it is a species of still or very slow flowing water. The <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> has a large Palaeartic distribution, and is found in a band across central Europe and Asia from Spain to the Pacific. It is {{not found in the}} far north in Europe and Asia or in the extreme south, being absent from southern Spain, southern Italy and Greece. It probably occurs in some areas of north Africa; where it occurs around the Mediterranean it is found at altitude. In Great Britain it is the only Lestes species that is common.|$|E
50|$|As a local nature reserve, {{the marsh}} is a habitat for various {{wildlife}} species. There are often sightings of {{birds of prey}} such as buzzards and kestrels, for the latter of which the marsh is an important nest site. Additionally there are pheasants, and herons, mallards, moorhens, kingfishers, and the rare Cetti's warbler and cirl bunting line the waterway. The wildflower meadows and pond sites attract butterflies, dragonflies, and damselflies, including the <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> as a Devon rarity. There are also a variety of mice and vole species, as well as larger mammals such as badgers and foxes. The woodland comprises oak, alder, ash, and willow.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{of the bay}} bears {{national}} and international nature conservation designations. These include the Sandwich Bay to Hacklinge Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), the Sandwich Bay Special Area of Conservation (SAC), the Thanet Coast and Sandwich Bay Special Protection Area for birds (SPA), and the Thanet Coast and Sandwich Bay Ramsar Site. [...] The Southern <b>Emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Lestes barbarus) was found here in 2003, only the second site in Great Britain at which this vagrant species had occurred. [...] There are several Geological Conservation Review sites within the SSSI. The bay {{is also home to}} the Sandwich Bay Bird Observatory Trust and the Monk's Wall nature reserve.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{the largest}} area of {{freshwater}} marsh in Greater London. It is very diverse, with large areas of reed sweet-grass, common reed swamp, wet neutral grassland and tall fen. These habitats have {{a wide variety of}} invertebrates and breeding birds. Invertebrates include sixteen nationally scarce fly, beetle dragonfly and cricket species. There are two nationally rare Red Data Book species, the hoverfly Anasimyia interpuncta and the scarce <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> Lestes dryas. 61 species of bird regularly breed on the site, such as the common redshank and the northern lapwing. Common cuckoos exploit the nests of reed warblers and sedge warblers. Havering Council has raised the water level and reintroduced grazing to protect the wetland.|$|E

The eastern half of the island is allocated to residential areas, the main public amenities and a small holiday camp and seafront, while the western half of the island is mainly farmland, marshes and industrial areas. The marshes in the west include the 30 hectares known as West Canvey marshes, acquired by the RSPB in 2007, and the Canvey Wick nature reserve.

40|$|We {{studied the}} mating {{system of the}} <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> Lestes sponsa. All males showed intense contact mate {{guarding}} by holding the female in tandem during the entire oviposition period. Our findings support the predictions made by Alcock (1994) about the occurrence of intense mate guarding: (1) a high female receptivity after copulation, (2) a high male capacity to resist takeovers, (3) sperm precedence, (4) a high operational sex ratio, (5) a high male density, (6) high access by rivals to mated females, (7) low energy expenditure, (8) a low risk of guarding, and (9) a short interval between copula and oviposition. This indicates a positive cost-benefit balance for this behavior, at least in males. A comparison within the genus Lestes suggests that the male-biased sex ratios and {{the ease with which}} mated females are detected have been strong selection pressures in the evolution of intense contact mate guarding. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The flight {{activity}} was compared for the Blue-tailed Damselfly Ischnura elegans, the Azure Damselfly and the <b>Emerald</b> <b>Damselfly</b> Lestes sponsa Coenagrion puella at an exposed pond and a sheltered pond at Rimac, Saltfleetby National Nature reserve, Lincolnshire in July and August 1998. Meteorological conditions (air temperature, light intensity, cloud cover, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction) were investigated concurrently {{in relation to}} flight activity of the three species. Flight activity of all three increased with rising air temperature, light intensity and declining cloud cover. These factors {{appear to be the}} main ones that exert control on day to day variation in flight activity of these three species. Their relative importance varies from species to species, which is most likely to be {{due to the nature of}} the exoskeletons (which influences the rate of solar radiation absorption), size (which influences rate of warming and power requirements) and behaviour. Only Coenagrion puella showed any relationship between mating activity (tandem wheel flight) and meteorological conditions...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{selection}} is hypothesized to favour small body size,in males of scrambling species, that is, {{those in which}} males obtain matings by actively searching for females. I tested this hypothesis in a natural population of the scrambling <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly,</b> Lestes sponsa. Mating efficiency (matings/visit to the pond) {{was the most important}} factor explaining variation in male lifetime mating success (LMS; 71 %). This suggests a large potential for sexual selection. Path analysis of male LMS suggested a quality factor that positively affected both mating efficiency and life span. In contrast with the small-male mating advantage hypothesis, part of this potential for sexual selection was realized as stabilizing selection on male body size, indicating that there may also be a lower limit to body size for mating efficiency. This also illustrates that the constancy of body size may be explained by sexual selection alone. Survival explained about 20 % of the variation in LMS and random processes were potentially important for determining LMS. My results show the problems of using mating efficiency as a measure for the intensity of sexual selection and the need to distinguish between. potential and realized selection pressures, especially when comparing the importance of natural and sexual selection. I discuss mechanisms that may have caused the intermediate-male mating advantage in this scrambling species. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. status: publishe...|$|E
