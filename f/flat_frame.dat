There {{is a small}} partial false gable roof of Spanish barrel red-clay tiles around the four sides and around the courtyard. On the front (south) facade, facing the ocean, there are five bays with a large elliptical arch-headed passageway large enough for vehicular traffic. It is architecturally marked only by a plain, <b>flat</b> <b>frame</b> painted differently {{from the body of}} the building. There are plain board, double doors with a smaller pedestrian port in the right door. In the elliptical arch there is a simple fanlight window. Flanking the arched entrance are two large high windows on each side. The windows are two-leaf casements with exterior solid and Jouvered combination paneled shutters. Metal grilles are at each window. The walls have a simple low projecting base course, and the first floor walls are marked by horizontal incised coursing, all in stucco. There is a large molded string course between stories and on the second floor, five door openings, each with double-leaf doors that are half sash, which replaced the original louvered and paneled shutter combinations. Over the doors are sashed transoms, although the right group has been replaced by air conditioners. Each opening has a decorative wrought iron balcony with scroll support dating from the U.S. remodeling of the building. Previous to these wrought-iron balconies, the building had cast iron railings. [...] "U.S. Customs" [...] is lettered over the central window. At the top is a large double masonry molded cornice, surmounted by the small false partial gable in Spanish tiles, both from 1924. On the front only, there are three flag poles on the roof, and a large antenna system. On each side of the first floor passage entry is an alarm box and a plain light fixture.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The x-ray {{performance}} evaluation of digital x-ray detectors {{is based on}} the calculation of the modulation transfer function (MTF), the noise power spectrum (NPS), and the resultant detective quantum efficiency (DQE). The flat images used for the extraction of the NPS should not contain any fixed pattern noise (FPN) to avoid contamination from nonstochastic processes. The "gold standard" method used for the reduction of the FPN (i. e., the different gain between pixels) in linear x-ray detectors is based on normalization with an average reference flat-field. However, the noise in the corrected image depends on the number of <b>flat</b> <b>frames</b> used for the average flat image. The aim {{of this study is to}} modify the standard gain correction algorithm to make it independent on the used reference <b>flat</b> <b>frames.</b> METHODS: Many publications suggest the use of 10 - 16 reference <b>flat</b> <b>frames,</b> while other studies use higher numbers (e. g., 48 frames) to reduce the propagated noise from the average flat image. This study quantifies experimentally the effect of the number of used reference <b>flat</b> <b>frames</b> on the NPS and DQE values and appropriately modifies the gain correction algorithm to compensate for this effect. RESULTS: It is shown that using the suggested gain correction algorithm a minimum number of reference <b>flat</b> <b>frames</b> (i. e., down to one frame) can be used to eliminate the FPN from the raw flat image. This saves computer memory and time during the x-ray {{performance evaluation}}. CONCLUSIONS: The authors show that the method presented in the study (a) leads to the maximum DQE value that one would have by using the conventional method and very large number of frames and (b) has been compared to an independent gain correction method based on the subtraction of flat-field images, leading to identical DQE values. They believe this provides robust validation of the proposed method...|$|R

50|$|The 'toast rack {{passenger}} carriage' {{has been}} a design feature of railways since their inception, with the name particularly common on miniature and light railways, where it refers to open-sided carriages (with or, especially on miniature railways, without roofs) where the essential design is a <b>flat</b> <b>frame</b> {{with a series of}} upright seats set at right-angles to the direction of the track, thus forming a crude representation of a toast rack. When the term 'toast rack carriage' is used of larger railways (up to, and sometimes including, standard gauge) it refers to coaches whose seats are set at right-angles to the track direction, and with no side corridor, central aisle, or corridor connection; thus each compartment is fully separated from the next by upright seats, again resembling the toast rack design. At these larger gauges the coaches may be fully enclosed, or 'semi-open' (with roofs and sides, but unglazed windows). Many railways have examples of toast rack carriages, and some (for example the Vale of Rheidol Railway in Wales) are known for a distinct preference for the design in their rolling stock fleet.|$|E
