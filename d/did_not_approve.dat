5|$|Another {{mission to}} Titan {{proposed}} in early 2012 by Jason Barnes, {{a scientist at}} the University of Idaho, is the Aerial Vehicle for In-situ and Airborne Titan Reconnaissance (AVIATR): an unmanned plane (or drone) that would fly through Titan's atmosphere and take high-definition images of the surface of Titan. NASA <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> the requested $715 million, {{and the future of}} the project is uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Besides poets, at {{high school}} Lewis met Sophie Carson, who {{eventually}} became his wife. Klein, their mutual friend, introduced them. Carson came from a religious Jewish family.

5|$|Champollion married Rosine Blanc (17941871) in 1818 {{after four}} years of engagement, they had one {{daughter}}, Zoraïde Chéronnet-Champollion (182489). Rosine was the daughter of a well-to-do family of Grenoblean glovemakers. At first her father <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> of the match, since Champollion was a mere assistant professor when they first met, but with his increasing reputation he eventually agreed. Originally Jacques-Joseph <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> of his brother's marriage either, finding Rosine too dull-witted, and he did not attend the wedding, but later he grew fond of his sister in-law. Although a happy family man, especially adoring his daughter, Champollion was frequently away from his family for months or even years at a time, while traveling to Paris, to Italy, and to Egypt. While in Livorno, Champollion developed an infatuation with an Italian poet, Angelica Palli. She presented an ode to Champollion's work at a celebration in his honor, and the two exchanged letters for a while, but an affair never developed.|$|E
5|$|Dark Magus was {{released}} after Davis' 1975 retirement, upon which his label, Columbia Records, issued several albums of various outtakes. After issuing the live recordings Agharta (1975) and Pangaea (1976), Columbia {{decided that they}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> of the albums, and Dark Magus {{was released}} only in Japan, in 1977 by CBS-Sony. The label's A executive Tatsu Nosaki suggested the album's title, which referred to the Magus from the Zoroastrian religion.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} as {{archbishop}} there was a dispute with the monks of Christ Church Priory in Canterbury, who resented Baldwin's attempts to impose stricter control over them and disputed the legitimacy of Baldwin's election.

Many of Zelda's friends and {{members of her family}} were wary of the relationship, as they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> of Scott's {{excessive}} drinking, and Zelda's Episcopalian family did not like {{the fact that he was}} a Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Always {{interested}} in military history, Kippenberger joined the local {{unit of the}} New Zealand Cadet Corps and found that he enjoyed soldiering. His father <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> of his interest but regardless, Kippenberger enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in late 1915 {{at the age of}} 18. Because only men between the ages of 19 and 45 were required to register for service, he falsified his age to ensure that he would be eligible for duty overseas.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1860s a deep rift had {{developed}} between Irataba, who was proactive in cooperating with white settlers, and Homoseh quahote, who passively tolerated but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> of white encroachment on Mohave lands. Irataba was Aha macave yaltanack of the Mohave from 1861 to 1866, but from 1867 to 1869 opinions differ, and by 1870 US government correspondence suggests that Homoseh quahote had succeeded him {{as leader of}} the Fort Mohave group.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{was obsessed}} with his health {{to the point of}} hypochondria, {{consulting}} many doctors and other practitioners for what he described to his captors in Britain as a long list of ailments involving the kidneys, colon, gall bladder, bowels and heart. Like Hitler, Hess was a vegetarian, and he did not smoke or drink. He brought his own food to the Berghof, claiming it was biologically dynamic, but Hitler <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> of this practice, so he discontinued taking meals with the Führer.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was inexperienced in relationships, but {{the well-to-do}} widow {{encouraged}} him and provided for {{him with her}} substantial savings. The two were married on 9 July 1735, at St. Werburgh's Church in Derby. The Porter family <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> of the match, partly because Johnson was 25 and Elizabeth was 21 years his elder. His mother's marriage to Johnson so disgusted her son Jervis that he stopped talking to her. Her other son Joseph later accepted the marriage, and her daughter, Lucy, accepted Johnson from the start.|$|E

Her father, Juan Ignacio Ezcurra, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> of their {{relationship}} because of the bankruptcy of Domingo Belgrano, Manuel's father. Juan Ignacio arranged the wedding of his daughter with Juan Esteban Ezcurra, a distant relative from Pamplona that worked selling clothes. Juan Ignacio opposed the May Revolution and returned to Spain, leaving his wife in Buenos Aires, which allowed her to return to her former relationship with Belgrano.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1928 President Coolidge {{signed the}} bill authorizing the dam. The Boulder Canyon Project Act {{appropriated}} $165million for the Hoover Dam {{along with the}} downstream Imperial Dam and All-American Canal, a replacement for Beatty's canal entirely on the U.S. side of the border.
