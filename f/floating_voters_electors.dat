40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{study the}} impact of preference uncertainty on voter turnout and electoral efficiency in a participation game. We find higher participation rates when the electorate is informed {{about the level of}} support for various candidates than when group sizes remain uncertain. Moreover, despite higher free riding incentives majorities win more often than minorities. In aggregate, whether or not group sizes are known hardly affects welfare. We also distinguish between allied and <b>floating</b> <b>voters</b> and our data show that the lower turnout under uncertainty can be attributed to <b>floating</b> <b>voters</b> participating less. Finally, our results match better the predictions by quantal response (logit) equilibria than by (Bayesian-) Nash equilibria. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{study the}} impact of public opinion poll releases on voter turnout and welfare in a participation game. We find higher turnout rates when polls inform the electorate about the levels of support for various candidates than when polls are prohibited. Distinguishing between allied and <b>floating</b> <b>voters,</b> our data show that this increase in turnout is entirely due to <b>floating</b> <b>voters.</b> Very high turnout is observed when polls indicate equal support levels for the candidates. This has negative consequences for welfare. Though in aggregate social welfare is hardly affected, majorities benefit more often from polls than minorities. Finally, our comparative static results are better predicted by quantal response (logit) equilibrium than by Bayesian Nash equilibrium. laboratory experiments. ...|$|R

Distinguishing be-tween allied and <b>floating</b> <b>voters,</b> our data show that this increase in turnout is entirely due to <b>floating</b> <b>voters.</b> When polls indicate equal levels of support for the candidates, turnout is high and welfare is low (compared to the situation without polls). In contrast, when polls reveal more unequal levels of support, turnout is lower with than without this information, while the effect of polls on welfare is non-negative.

40|$|This article {{describes}} how a unique research approach {{was used to}} evaluate how different communication channel experiences influenced <b>floating</b> <b>voters</b> during the campaign period of the 2010 British general election. Most previous research focuses on voting behaviour as a single cross-sectional phenomenon, and on self-assessments of the relative importance of marketing communications - during, or more typically after, the campaign. This study outlines the influence of different marketing communications (including word-of-mouth and PR through mediated communications) over time using a longitudinal panel of <b>floating</b> <b>voters</b> and a real-time tracking approach. Results indicate the relative importance of the debates, used in 2010 {{for the first time in}} the UK, and more surprisingly the relative importance of party election broadcasts and posters...|$|R

5000|$|In an election, {{there are}} [...] "certain" [...] or [...] "lock" [...] votes, {{voters who are}} solidly behind or {{partisan}} to a particular candidate and will not consider changing their minds whatever the opposition says. Swing voters are undecided about how they will vote. They are {{sometimes referred to as}} undecideds, undecided <b>voters,</b> or <b>floating</b> <b>voter.</b>|$|R

50|$|Initiative is {{the process}} wherein either the state {{statutes}} or the state constitution is amended through citizen action. This process begins when qualified <b>voters</b> (<b>electors)</b> submit a petition outlining the proposed amendment to the Secretary of State. This petition must then be signed by 10% of the registered voters who actually voted {{in the most recent}} gubernatorial election for statutory amendments; this percentage increases to 15% for constitutional amendments. If enough signatures are obtained the initiative will appear on the subsequent general ballot for voter approval. A 50% majority is required for a ballot proposal to pass and become law.|$|R
50|$|In the 2001 general {{election}} campaign, Blair emphasised {{the theme of}} improving public services, notably the National Health Service and the State education system. The Conservatives concentrated on opposing British membership of the Euro, which did little to win over <b>floating</b> <b>voters.</b> The Labour Party preserved its majority, and Blair became the first Labour Prime Minister to win a full second term. However, the election was notable for a large fall in voter turnout.|$|R

5000|$|... "Motorway man" [...] is a {{political}} term used by polling companies in the United Kingdom. The phrase was coined by Jim Pickard of the Financial Times {{in the run-up to}} the 2010 general election and describes a type of <b>floating</b> <b>voter</b> who it is believed can determine the outcome of an election by the way he casts his vote. The name is derived from the idea that this type of voter lives on a modern housing estate with easy access to the motorway network.|$|R
5000|$|A swing <b>voter</b> or <b>floating</b> <b>voter</b> is a voter {{who may not}} be {{affiliated}} with a particular political party (Independent) or who will vote across party lines. In American politics, many centrists, liberal Republicans, and conservative Democrats are considered [...] "swing voters" [...] since their voting patterns cannot be predicted with certainty. While the swing voter is ostensibly the target of most political activity during elections, in countries without compulsory voting the political parties know that the shift from one party to another is dependent only to a limited extent on swing voters.|$|R
5000|$|As {{people were}} being bought, {{the main focus of}} this was the market of vote buying. At the {{beginning}} of voting for candidates the market opened for business. Mark Wahlgren Summers writes that [...] "On that day the market for votes opened at five dollars, with a brisk demand and strong upward tendency." [...] At the beginning of an election most voters would receive five dollars, but as the election process continued people could obtain as much as fifty dollars for their vote. The dictation of the prices fluctuated since this was a market, but as the election dwindled to the end voters could receive these high payments. As Business Report, in New York in 1888 dispatched information to the public, this only helped those who were <b>floating</b> <b>voters</b> have better chances of receiving greater compensation for their vote since they knew what was a reasonable offer. Furthermore, this complicated the discussion between the runner and the <b>floating</b> <b>voter.</b> Runners were bargaining to get the cheapest prices, while voters desired to receive the highest payment they could. In all vote buying led to changes in the polls as Senator George Edmunds remarked in 1889, [...] "divisions of parties in several of the states have been so close that the purchase of a comparatively small number of votes could easily turn the scale." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decades the number of <b>floating</b> <b>voters</b> has risen in many democracies and {{particularly}} in the Netherlands. Although media is likely to influence electoral volatility, it has often been neglected as a possible explanation for vote switching. Therefore, this dissertation examines how information provided by the media during election campaigns affects electoral volatility. The studies in this dissertation provide insights into which types and which aspects of campaign news coverage affect which type of electoral volatility, through which underlying mechanisms. In this way it aims to unravel whether citizens are making well-informed vote choices...|$|R
50|$|The party middle-elite {{consists}} of loyal party voters, party members, and regional or local office holders. Unlike the party elite, this stratum usually {{consists of}} volunteers and part-time {{members who are}} not as directly affected by the electoral success of the party. Since they willingly volunteer their free-time to political activism and campaigning, the middle-elite often tend to hold more deeply embedded ideological beliefs than both the party elite and non-elite (or <b>floating</b> <b>voters).</b> The middle-elite tend to be strongly emotionally and psychologically invested in politics and seek to project their ideological convictions to the party elite and the public at large.|$|R
5000|$|Non-balanced debates: In most {{democratic}} {{countries the}} positions of the political parties have become very much alike. This means that there is not much to choose from for its voters. The effect is that political campaigns are looking more like advertising to make the differences look bigger. Also the private lives of the politicians have become an important item in elections. Sometimes [...] "sensitive" [...] issues stay undiscussed. The English conservative journalist Peter Oborne presented a documentary of the 2005 general election, arguing that it had become anti-democratic because it targeted a number of <b>floating</b> <b>voters</b> with a narrow agenda.|$|R

50|$|Having {{verified}} {{and marked}} off the voter's {{name and address}} {{on the list of}} electors, the presiding officer or poll clerk issues the ballot paper, calling out the <b>voter's</b> name, <b>elector</b> number and polling district reference, unless the voter is an anonymous elector, in which case only his/her elector number is called out. Ballot papers cannot be issued before 7am and can only be issued after 10pm to a voter who was present in the queue at/outside the polling station at 10pm. All ballot papers contain both an official mark (e.g. a watermark or perforation) and a unique identifying number; any papers issued without both these features (even if it is the presiding officer/poll clerk's mistake) will be invalid and rejected at the count. On a separate list (called the corresponding number list) the presiding officer or poll clerk writes the <b>voter's</b> <b>elector</b> number next to the unique identifying number of the ballot paper issued. However, the secrecy of the vote is usually maintained, as {{at the close of the}} poll this list linking voters to their ballot paper numbers is sealed inside a packet which may only be opened by the order of a court in the event that the election result is challenged. The ballot paper is folded and then handed to the voter.|$|R
40|$|In 1878 {{the liberal}} parties lost {{enough votes to}} loose the {{majority}} in the parliament which they had defended in the general election just one year before. In this paper, the question of where the voters came from and why the voting changed so crucially within one year are re-examined. The analysis uses a new set of data aggregated at a lower level than those examined by previous stud-ies and makes use of King’s Algorithm, a tool provided by modern political science. The main finding of this paper is that the change towards protectionism was not caused by new, but by <b>floating</b> <b>voters</b> from the agricultural sector. ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1992 election, Labour made {{considerable}} progress - {{reducing the}} Conservative's majority to just 21 seats. It {{came as a}} shock to many when the Conservatives won a majority, but the [...] "triumphalism" [...] perceived by some observers of a Labour Party rally in Sheffield (together with Kinnock's performance on the podium) may have helped put <b>floating</b> <b>voters</b> off. Although internal polls suggested no impact, while public polls suggested a decline in support had already occurred, most of those directly involved in the campaign believe that the rally really came to widespread attention only after the electoral defeat itself, with Kinnock himself changing his mind to a rejection of its negative impact over time.|$|R

That explains why the tide has turned against the communists...Bengal's communism was unique in that it grew among the people not through armed revolution. This was a party that grew by consensus by carrying with them all sections of middle class, rural and urban poor - even the gentry. But somewhere down the line, the arrogance of power led them to adopt narrow, sectarian politics and that is their undoing now." ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{assesses the}} role of {{political}} web sites in the campaign for the Dutch parliamentary elections of 2002. It {{presents the results of}} an online survey of 18, 000 visitors to political Web sites to examine how far, 1) political Web sites can engage people in politics and, 2) party Web sites in particular can reach <b>floating</b> <b>voters.</b> The results of the survey reveal that political Web sites are only partly able to involve people in politics who have thus far remained aloof. Yet, political Web sites are successful in reaching young people, a group which is usually less politically active but which uses the Internet more intensively. The use of political Web sites does not lead to a more active engagement in politics. For most people the primary reason for visiting a political Web site was finding information about the positions of political parties, about party organisations or about the election campaign. Not only party supporters, but also <b>floating</b> and undecided <b>voters</b> were interested in this information...|$|R
40|$|Against the {{background}} of a substantial rise {{of the number of}} late-deciding voters at recent elections the paper simultaneously tests four complementary hypotheses on {{the background}} of contemporary electors’ timing of decision making. The traditional <b>floating</b> <b>voter</b> hypothesis fares best in this analysis: lacking partisan predispositions and a general detachment from politics appear as the main reasons why people take longer to make up their minds. Indifference and attitudinal ambivalence as well as mixed party-political signals from voters’ social networks also lead to electors postponing their voting decisions. The hypothesis that late deciding is a consequence of increased availability and attention to mediated political information is refuted. Several long-term trends are discussed as reasons for the increase of late deciding...|$|R
