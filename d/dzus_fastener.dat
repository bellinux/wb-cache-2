50|$|William Dzus (5 January 1895, Chernykhivtsi, Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, {{presently}} Ukraine, - 19 June 1964, New York City, United States) {{was born}} Volodymyr Dzhus (Володимир Джус) {{and was an}} American engineer from Eastern Galicia, and {{the inventor of the}} <b>Dzus</b> <b>fastener,</b> also known as the quarter-turn fastener. He {{was also one of the}} founders of the Ukrainian Institute of America, a cultural foundation, for which he purchased the Harry F. Sinclair House (its current home).|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>Dzus</b> <b>fasteners</b> {{installed}} on {{a race car}} were installed by the Justice Brothers, Ed Justice, Sr. and Zeke Justice while working at Kurtis-Kraft in Glendale, California. It was {{at the suggestion of}} Ed who was an A&E at Douglas Aircraft prior to World War II and had graduated from Fry Aircraft School in Kansas City, Kansas. The car the <b>Dzus</b> <b>fasteners</b> were installed upon was [...] "Bullet" [...] Joe Garson's Kurtis-Kraft midget. This was done while the shop owner Frank Kurtis was out of town. At first he was not happy with their alteration to his design, but later realize the benefit of using <b>Dzus</b> <b>fasteners.</b>|$|R

5000|$|After the war Ed joined Zeke at Kurtis-Kraft {{where they}} helped build {{many of the}} now legendary Kurtis-Kraft midget, Indy cars, and sports cars. During their time at Kurtis-Kraft, Ed and Zeke opened a {{separate}} shop in Glendale, California where they would do race car fabrication and repair. This was filling the need caused by the tremendous demand {{at the time and}} also Kurtis-Kraft's lack of time to address repairs due to the production of new cars. Kurtis-Kraft midgets were available in completed form or also in [...] "kit" [...] form. The Justice Brothers were hired by many to build [...] "kit" [...] cars for them, including Bill Vukovich, Loren Bennett, Jack Zimmermann and others. While at Kurtis-Kraft, Ed and Zeke installed the first <b>Dzus</b> <b>fasteners</b> on a race car while Frank was out of town on business. At first Frank was not happy with their change to his design, but later realize the benefit of using <b>Dzus</b> <b>fasteners.</b> The idea came from Ed's training as an aircraft mechanic. Ed had worked at Douglas Aircraft Flight Test in Santa Monica, California before the war and was an A&E. The first race car with <b>Dzus</b> <b>fasteners</b> was [...] "Bullet" [...] Joe Garson's Kurtis-Kraft midget sponsored by Bowes Seal Fast and owned by famed race car driver Rex Mays.|$|R
50|$|In 1948 a {{prominent}} Ukrainian immigrant New-Yorker, William Dzus, self-made millionaire, inventor {{and owner of}} <b>Dzus</b> <b>Fastener</b> Company, founded the Ukrainian Institute of America. William Dzus came to America with $25 {{in his pockets and}} worked his way up from the very bottom, epitomizing the American success story for the Ukrainian community. Dzus charitable contributions to his community culminated with the purchase of the famous Harry F. Sinclair House {{for the use of the}} institute, which became central to Ukrainian American educational, scientific, cultural and humanitarian life in New York City.|$|E

50|$|One common {{improvement}} {{places the}} female parts {{in a small}} bucket to reduce entry of water. Another {{is to make it}} easier to open and close: For example, many modern <b>Dzus</b> <b>fasteners</b> use self-centering screw-drivers. Other improvements reduce the cost. For example, changing the spring so it can be secured to the female hole avoids the cost of rivets. Some manufacturers die-cast the button rather than machining it.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, Ducati revamped their 748 model line {{to include}} a third variation. The base model was {{now known as the}} 748E, {{available}} as Biposto or Monoposto, with 3-spoke gold wheels and gold frame. Gone were the quick-release <b>Dzus</b> <b>fasteners</b> on the fairing, replaced with plain fairing fasteners, and the frame also had a fixed steering head angle. The rear shock was a Sachs-Boge unit with Showa forks. This helped to keep costs down.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Dzus</b> <b>fastener's</b> {{removable}} part is a button (12) {{that can turn}} if a screwdriver {{is placed in the}} slot (21) of its head (14). The button (12) is held to the cowling (10) by its head (14) and a groove (19). The groove assures that the button (12) does not fall off the cowling (10) when the cowling is unfastened. The hole (25) includes a finish or material so that the button (12) does not bind when turned.|$|R
5000|$|Invented and {{patented}} by an American engineer of Ukrainian descent William Dzus (Volodymyr Dzhus) {{in the early}} 1930s, <b>Dzus</b> <b>fasteners</b> are also used to secure plates, doors, and panels that require frequent removal for inspection and servicing. These fasteners are notable {{in that they are}} of an [...] "over-centre" [...] design, requiring positive sustained torque to unfasten. Thus, any minor disturbance to the fastener (e.g. vibration) will tend to correct itself rather than proceed to further loosening as it would in threaded fasteners. Turnlock fasteners are available in several different styles and are usually referred to by the manufacturer's trade name. Some of the most common are DZUS, Camloc, and Airloc.|$|R
2500|$|Using a <b>dzus</b> cowling <b>fastener</b> as a gauge {{to compare}} the nine objects to the distant DC-4, Arnold {{estimated}} their angular size as slightly smaller than the DC-4, about the width between the outer engines (about 60 feet). Arnold also said {{he realized that the}} objects would have to be quite large to see any details at that distance and later, after comparing notes with a United Airlines crew that had a similar sighting 10 days later (see below), placed the absolute size as larger than a DC-4 airliner (or greater than [...] in length). Army Air Force analysts would later estimate 140 to , based on analysis of human visual acuity and other sighting details (such as estimated distance).|$|R

Army Air Force analysts would later estimate 140 to 280 ft, based on analysis of human visual acuity and other sighting details (such as estimated distance). Arnold said the objects were grouped together, as Ted Bloecher writes, [...] "in a diagonally stepped-down, echelon formation, stretched out over a distance that he later calculated to be five miles". Though moving on a more or less level horizontal plane, Arnold said the objects weaved from side to side ("like the tail of a Chinese kite" [...] as he later stated), darting through the valleys and around the smaller mountain peaks. They would occasionally flip or bank on their edges in unison as they turned or maneuvered causing almost blindingly bright or mirror-like flashes of light. The encounter gave him an [...] "eerie feeling", but Arnold suspected he had seen test flights of a new U.S. military aircraft.|$|R
