40|$|While {{there is}} a {{substantial}} literature highlighting the presence of social dynamics in legislatures, we know very little about the precise processes that generate these social dynamics. Yet, whether social dynamics are due to peer pressure, frequency of interaction, or genuine learning, for example, has important implications for questions of political representation and accountability. We demonstrate how a recent innovation can be used to study the di�usion of behavior within legislatures. In particular, we study di�usion within the U. S.

The <b>discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> shares many characteristics with other forms of legislative behavior, yet it has one important advantage when it comes to studying social dynamics: we can observe when members decide to sign petitions.

40|$|After Yogyakarta {{earthquake}} in 2006, {{the main problem}} {{that occurred in the}} first yard of Prambanan Temple is ponding area that occurred after rainfall. Soil characterization needs to be determined by conducting several processes, especially permeability coefficient (k) in both saturated and unsaturated conditions to solve this problem. More accurate and efficient field testing procedure is required to obtain permeability data that present the field condition. One of the field permeability test equipment is Constant <b>Discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> to determine the permeability coefficient. Necessary adjustments of the Constant <b>Discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> are needed to be determined especially the value of geometric factor (F) to improve the corresponding value of permeability coefficient. The value of k will be correlated with the value of volumetric water content (θ) of an unsaturated condition until saturated condition. The principle procedure of Constant Discharge model provides a constant flow in permeameter tube that flows into the ground until the water level in the tube becomes constant. Constant water level in the tube is highly dependent on the tube dimension. Every tube dimension has a shape factor called the geometric factor that affects the result of the test. Geometric factor value is defined as the characteristic of shape and radius of the tube. This research has modified the geometric factor parameters by using empty material tube method so that the geometric factor will change. Saturation level is monitored by using soil moisture sensor. The field test results were compared with the results of laboratory tests to validate the results of the test. Field and laboratory test results of empty tube material method have an average difference of 3. 33 x 10 - 4 cm/sec. The test results showed that modified geometric factor provides more accurate data. The improved methods of constant <b>discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> provide more relevant results...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find out: (a) the role played by various {{agencies}} in the <b>discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> and (b) former psychiatric patients" own perspective on their social network, quality of life and future life expectations. The theoretical framework is based on Mead's symbolic interactionism, Asplund's interpretation of Tönnies' concepts Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft and Buber's dialogical philosophy. Descriptive, quantitative and qualitative data were gathered on four occasions from May 1984 to December 1986. On three occasions professionals provided information by means of structured questionnaires. Information on the last occasion was provided by former patients through interviews by means of a semistructured questionnaire. Seventy-three patients were discharged during the research period. I was able to follow 50 through all four stages. Fifty-three patients were interviewed. Other agencies were hardly involved at all in the <b>discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> except for the provision of home support. The duration of and stigma attached to mental illness, being without work and gender seemed to have the most influence on the primary network. The same issues (with the exception of gender), together with place of residence, financial difficulties and inability to exert influence over one's own situation influenced the former patients' quality of life and their expectations of the future. Special attention has been given to their occupational situation and to their relations to the professional network. Work opportunities were highly valued but most of the former patients were excluded from the labour market. The LFP groups satisfaction with the home care workers and dissatisfaction with the psychiatric professionals seemed to be due to the former's ability to undertake a ’caring’ relationship.
