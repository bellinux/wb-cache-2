40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the social psychological significance of 'community', {{as it is}} experienced and talked about in Brixton, a culturally diverse area in South London. There are two points of entry into the social psychology of a community: (1) the negotiation of social representations {{of the community and}} (2) the co-construction of community identities. The theoretical perspective that I have developed through this research is grounded in the theory of social representations (Moscovici, 1984, 1988; Farr, 1987) and draws on other theories of representation (Hall, 1997 a), community (Cohen, 995), identity and self-consciousness (Hall, 1991 a; Tajfel, 1982; Mead, 1934), stigma (Goffman, 1968) and the media (Thompson, 1995). It is an ethnographic study which combines ongoing participant-observation, 7 focus groups with 44 adolescents aged between 12 and 16, 5 in-depth interviews with <b>deputy-heads</b> of Brixton's schools, a media analysis of a documentary set in Brixton, and follow-up discussions. These accounts are woven together to answer the principal research question: how is `community' lived in Brixton? This study shows that communities emerge as sites of struggle in the negotiation of self-identity, belonging and difference. Community identities are constructed through and against social representations of the community, particularly those in the media. Two competing representations of Brixton - 'Brixton as Diverse' and 'Brixton as Bad' — were found in the same representational field. The data illustrate the different ways in which people affirm, manipulate and contest these ambivalent social representations in order to defend their perspective on Brixton, and so either claim or reject community membership. I examine how these representations both reflect and construct the social reality of Brixton. This reveals the potential of social representations to construct, delimit and empower the living of community. The systematic analysis of social representations of community and community identities demonstrates the pressing need for a social psychology of community...|$|R

40|$|Contextualisation&# 13; This {{research}} note {{focuses on}} the assumptions made {{about the ways in}} which teachers work&# 13; with their colleagues. It further focuses on issues of inter-professional collaboration between&# 13; public service professionals involved in services targeted at supporting children and young&# 13; people. This is significant at a time when the UK Government initiative, ‘Every Child Matters’,&# 13; seeks to ensure just such a collaboration. The work-in-progress reported here argues,&# 13; however, that such collaboration needs to be built upon an understanding of how intraprofessional&# 13; practices, within individual professions, work. &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; Abstract: Teachers work with a number of other professionals when supporting children&# 13; in their care. They also necessarily have to work with other teachers. This research note&# 13; reports the initial findings from two studies aimed at exploring the factors teachers&# 13; perceive to be significant when working with their colleagues. Study (1) involved an&# 13; opportunity interview sample of primary, secondary and special school teachers, working&# 13; predominantly in management positions or teaching in classrooms. Thematic coding,&# 13; informed by a grounded theory perspective, was used to analyse this data. Study (2) &# 13; involved semi-structured audio-taped interviews with 13 <b>deputy-head</b> teachers drawn&# 13; from primary, secondary and special school settings. Current work on the coding&# 13; structures, and categories needed to analyse this data in the light of the previous data,&# 13; are highlighted. As a result of the initial analysis, a need for a greater understanding of&# 13; the significance of intra-professional practices is identified. It is suggested that these&# 13; necessarily inform effective inter-professional collaboration...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory and}} {{practice}} of reform as reflected in teachers’ experience of meetings in schools. This empirical study has been carried out in a coeducational school for pupils up to the age of 16 ("grundskola") during the school years 1988 - 89 up to and including 1991 / 92. In this study 26 teachers and five school administrators - head teachers and <b>deputy-head</b> teachers - have been interviewed. Personal observation, analysis of the minutes taken at meetings and questionnaires has also been used. These methods have been used to study both formal and informal meetings. The research problem was approached through three questions: How do teachers experience these meetings in school? Of what importance are these meetings? What effect did the proposals and reforms, which aimed at introducing and developing meetings in school, have at local level? The empirical material has been interpreted and analysed from an analytical point of view which is based upon investigators’ and school-politicians’ – central governments’ – supposition that a structural change in the organisation of teachers’ work which involves them in new forms of meeting - so called "work teams" (arbetsenheter) - and result in increased interdepartmental democracy, giving teachers a new mandate with increased authority to make decisions. This has been a theme in Swedish school reform activity since the late 70 ’s in the enquiry Skolans inre arbete (SOU 1973 : 54) - "Internal Organisation in Schools’"as well as in the 90 ’s (amongst others) by the School Commission Om skola i en ny tid - "Schools in a New Age (SOU 1997 : 121). My combination of a field study based on teachers’ praxis, interpreted and analysed in relation to the central governments’ reform work gives the dissertation special value; that it contains, amongst other things, information and understanding of what takes place between central and local levels and how reforms are received and possibly put into practice in schools. Key words: Sociology of school, meetings, meetings of the work-units, formal and informal meetings...|$|E
