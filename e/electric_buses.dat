5|$|More recently, preservationists persuaded Congress to {{designate}} , or about 89% of the park, as the Yosemite Wilderness—a highly protected wilderness area. The Park Service has reduced artificial inducements {{to visit the}} park, such as the Firefall, in which red-hot embers were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point at night. Traffic congestion in Yosemite Valley {{during the summer months}} has become a concern. Two <b>electric</b> <b>buses</b> commenced service in September 1995. The buses are quiet and do not emit pollutants. Eventually, all the buses in Yosemite will be electric.|$|E

5|$|A {{regional}} {{transit authority}} {{was formed in}} the early 1990s to build and operate a light rail system that would use the bus tunnel within Downtown Seattle. The authority, later named Sound Transit, gained voter approval in November 1996 to build a $3.9billion system between Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, Downtown Seattle, and the University District. In 1998, Sound Transit found that the rails in the tunnel {{would need to be}} replaced at a cost of up to $110 million and require a full closure for two years. The plan would also require the purchase of new hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>buses</b> to replace the Breda fleet, as the electrical systems were incompatible. Convention Place station would have to be abandoned as it was too shallow to support a northern extension under Interstate 5.|$|E
5|$|New energy vehicle {{sales in}} China totaled 951,447 units between January 2011 and December 2016.

25|$|<b>Electric</b> trolley <b>buses</b> {{operate on}} major routes {{in the city}} of Vancouver, with one route {{extending}} to neighbouring Burnaby. Most trolley bus routes operate in a north–south direction. Trolley buses receive electricity from a network of overhead wires.

The new trolley buses have low floors and are fully wheelchair accessible.|$|R

The Tindo bus is a 100% solar bus that operates as free public transport service in Adelaide City as an initiative of the City Council. Bus services which use <b>electric</b> <b>buses</b> that are partially powered by solar panels installed on the bus roof, intended to reduce energy consumption and to prolong the life cycle of the rechargable battery of the electric bus, have been put in place in China.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2005 General Electric {{introduced}} its hybrid electric gear shifters on the market. Toyota {{claims to have}} started with the Coaster Hybrid Bus in 1997 on the Japanese market. In May 2003 General Motors started to tour with hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>buses</b> developed together with Allison. Several hundreds of those buses have entered into daily operation in the U.S. The Blue Ribbon City Hybrid bus was presented by Hino, a Toyota affiliate, in January 2005. Mitsubishi Fuso have developed a Diesel engine hybrid bus using lithium batteries in 2002, and this model has since seen limited service in several Japanese cities.|$|E
25|$|The first {{deliveries}} in {{the country}} occurred on August 22, 2013, at Tesla's European Distribution Center in Tilburg. A total of 1,194 units were sold in 2013.

25|$|Bus {{services}} use buses {{on conventional}} roads to carry numerous passengers on shorter journeys. Buses operate with low capacity (compared with trams or trains), and can operate on conventional roads, with relatively inexpensive bus stops to serve passengers. Therefore, buses {{are commonly used}} in smaller cities, towns, and rural areas, and for shuttle services supplementing other means of transit in large cities. Bus rapid transit is an ambiguous term used for buses operating on dedicated right-of-way, much like a light rail. Trolleybuses are <b>electric</b> <b>buses</b> that receive power from overhead wires for mobility. Online Electric Vehicles are buses that run on a conventional battery, but are recharged frequently at certain points via underground wires.|$|E
25|$|In {{practice}} {{there is}} a sliding scale of green transport depending on the sustainability of the option. Green vehicles are more fuel-efficient, but only in comparison with standard vehicles, and they still contribute to traffic congestion and road crashes. Well-patronised public transport networks based on traditional diesel buses use less fuel per passenger than private vehicles, and are generally safer and use less road space than private vehicles. Green public transport vehicles including electric trains, trams and <b>electric</b> <b>buses</b> combine the advantages of green vehicles with those of sustainable transport choices. Other transport choices with very low environmental impact are cycling and other human-powered vehicles, and animal powered transport. The most common green transport choice, with the least environmental impact is walking.|$|E
25|$|The main {{local and}} {{regional}} bus station of Utrecht is located adjacent to Utrecht Centraal railway station, at the East and West entrances. Due to large scale renovation and construction works at the railway station, the station's bus stops are changing frequently. As a general rule, westbound buses depart from the bus station on the west entrance, other buses from the east side station. Local buses in Utrecht are operated by Qbuzz – its services include a high-frequency service to the Uithof university district. The local bus fleet is one of Europe's cleanest, using only buses compliant with the Euro-VI standard as well as <b>electric</b> <b>buses</b> for inner city transport. Regional buses from the city are operated by Arriva and Connexxion.|$|E

50|$|The RTA {{operates}} with diesel and <b>electric</b> trolley <b>buses.</b> Dayton is {{the smallest}} city in the United States to still operate <b>electric</b> trolley <b>buses.</b> The trolley buses travel at least five miles on RTA routes serving Dayton and some neighboring suburbs. The routes include: Route 1, Route 2, Route 3, Route 4, Route 5, Route 7 and Route 8. Bus service to Dayton International Airport from downtown Dayton began on 11 August 2013. Service was expanded to stops on Pentagon Boulevard in Beavercreek, allowing access to the Fairfield Commons Mall and Soin Medical Center, on January 12, 2014.|$|R
5000|$|Urban, suburban, and {{interurban}} transport has included streetcars, electric railways, <b>electric</b> trolleys (trolley <b>buses),</b> motor buses, and motor coaches. [...] The Saskatoon Electric Railway and Power Company, Moose Jaw Electric Railway Company and the Regina Municipal Railway , were electric railways, and were first operational in 1911. Regina stopped using the <b>electric</b> trolley <b>buses</b> in 1966. Saskatoon's streetcar system closed in 1951, and its trolley bus system in 1974. The Saskatoon Transit System was renamed Saskatoon Transit Services in 1995.|$|R
