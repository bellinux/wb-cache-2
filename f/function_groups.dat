40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{study was to}} examine how music {{teachers}} can create a well <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> dynamic that benefits learning within an ensemble. The study was based on the following questions: (1) How can the leader of a group contribute to a well <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> dynamic? (2) Which ways of thinking and attitudes are beneficial to convey to the students? (3) Which are the most common social obstacles for a well <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> dynamic? The method of the study was qualitative. I chose to interview 4 music teachers from Norrbotten that teach at music school and Music University. The result showed that the group dynamic within an ensemble is affected by many different factors. The positive atmosphere, an accepting attitude, a humorous outlook on things, the ability to see se eachothers differences as assets and to have common goals emerged as important factors in creating a well <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> dynamic. According to the literature and the informants a well <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> dynamic is a prerequisite for learning in a group.

40|$|The less {{affected}} hemisphere {{is important}} in motor recovery in mature brains. However, in terms of motor outcome in immature brains, no study has been reported on the less affected corticospinal tract in hemiplegic pediatric patients. Therefore, we {{examined the relationship between}} the condition of the less affected corticospinal tract and motor function in hemiplegic pediatric patients. Forty patients with hemiplegia due to perinatal or prenatal injury (13. 7 ± 3. 0 months) and 40 age-matched typically developing controls were recruited. These patients were divided into two age-matched <b>groups,</b> the high <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> (20 patients) and the low <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> (20 patients) using functional level of hemiplegia scale. Diffusion tensor tractography images showed that compared with the control group, the patient group of the less affected corticospinal tract showed significantly increased fiber number and significantly decreased fractional anisotropy value. Significantly increased fiber number and significantly decreased fractional anisotropy value in the low <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> were observed than in the high <b>functioning</b> <b>group.</b> These findings suggest that activation of the less affected hemisphere presenting as increased fiber number and decreased fractional anisotropy value is related to poor motor function in pediatric hemiplegic patients...|$|R

40|$|To {{separate}} functional from phylogenetic pelvic {{differences in}} Aves, seventy-seven birds were measured and statistically analyzed {{to define the}} characters that unite them into <b>function</b> <b>groups,</b> and to identify the characters that separate the <b>function</b> <b>groups</b> from each other. Four Major <b>Function</b> <b>Groups</b> were identified: Birds of Prey (Chapter II) Waterbirds (Chapter III), Ground birds and Stalker-wader birds (Chapter V). Birds of Prey statistically separate into Air predators and Scavengers. Waterbirds statistically divide into Surface swimmers, Wing-propelled divers, and Foot-propelled divers. A suite of pelvic characters (Level One indicators) can separate nonpasseriformes birds into <b>function</b> <b>groups.</b> These are: length to width ratio of the pelvis, iliac angle, relative iliac surface areas and pre-acetabular ilium proportions. A second suite of characters (Level Two indicators), used by themselves, shows trends, but do not completely separate the <b>function</b> <b>groups.</b> These are proportional length of lower leg components, and femur length: pelvis length ratio. Combining the identified characters in Principal Component Analysis and Discriminant Function Analysis produces a good split among the <b>function</b> <b>groups.</b> When all of the birds are combined into a single analysis (Chapter V), using Level one and Level Two characters, the plots generated have Stalker-wader birds at the center, with three groups radiating out. One arm is Ground Birds, another is Waterbirds, {{and the third is}} Birds of Prey. ^ Pelvic musculature dissections of a representative from each group are compared (Chapter VI). The picture drawn from the muscle data is different. The muscle data suggest that Ground Birds are the central group. Ground Birds (represented by a pigeon) have leg/pelvic muscles neither specialized for specific femoral movements, nor for specific tibiotarsal movements. No particular group of muscles is hypertrophied, and no major groups are reduced or missing. The other three <b>function</b> <b>groups</b> of birds show some degree of specialization, either by reducing or accentuating muscles, or by losing muscles completely. The result is a statistical portrait of four bird <b>function</b> <b>groups</b> that has implications for the sequence of morphological changes seen in avian radiations of the Tertiary. ...|$|E

Telbivudine plasma concentration-time profiles were similar across the four hepatic <b>function</b> <b>groups.</b> The principal pharmacokinetic parameters of drug exposure, i. e., the maximum plasma concentration and area under the drug concentration-time curve, were comparable between subjects with various degrees of hepatic impairment and those with normal hepatic function.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{inherited}} disorders causing severe and progressive neurological deficits are linked to peroxisomal dysfunction. More than 15 peroxisomal diseases with neurological manifestations {{and some of them}} with dysmorphic features are identified. The diseases are classified into three groups depending on some similarities in the pathophysiology of the diseases within each group: defective assembly of the organelle resulting in impairment of multiple peroxisomal <b>functions</b> (<b>group</b> I); peroxisomes present and loss of several peroxisomal enzyme <b>functions</b> (<b>group</b> II); peroxisomes present and loss of a single peroxisomal enzym <b>function</b> (<b>group</b> III). Apparently similar clinical phenotypes may correspond to different biochemical deficits, and the same biochemical defect(s) can be associated with different clinical phenotypes. With the study of human peroxisomal diseases, advances have been gained as to the function of the peroxisome in normal and pathological conditions. Most important functions of peroxisomes in humans include beta-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives, ether-phospholipid biosynthesis, pipecolic acid degradation, phytanic acid oxidation, and glyoxylate detoxification.

The subjects for this study were drawn from men and women aged 70 - 79 from 3 Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE) programs in East Boston MA, New Haven CT, and Durham County NC screened on the basis of criteria of physical and cognitive function.
