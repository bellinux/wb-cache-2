Thereafter the noblemen's political factions engaged in conflict and elected two kings. One of them, John I Szapolyai (15261540) {{was supported by the}} lesser nobility, while Ferdinand I of Habsburg (15261564) was recognized mainly in the kingdom's western counties, but the Transylvanian Saxons also supported him. Seeking the assistance of the Ottomans, John <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> homage to the sultan at Mohács in 1529.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, Sanz {{suffered}} a mental breakdown and took two months off {{in the middle of}} a world tour at the request of his doctor. The breakdown was caused by several events in his personal life, including the death of his father in 2005, his separation with Mexican model and actress Jaydy Mitchel, and his announcement that he had a three-year-old son outside of his marriage with Mitchel. He commented on the situation, saying [...] "You have to put things in perspective. It was stress, something that had never affected me, but this time, yes, it did. So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> A doctor told me to stop for a couple of months to recuperate completely." [...] Sanz spent time in therapy, a time which [...] "helped [...] a lot" [...] and gave him [...] "more power" [...] to perform.|$|E

[...] The paper stated that he was the Indian who killed General Custer! [...] The chief and his people had been held prisoners of war, and now here they were to appear in a Philadelphia theater. [...] So I determined to go and see what he had to say, and what he was really in the East for. [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> fifty cents for a ticket.

2500|$|Petrović needed new challenges, which Cibona and the Yugoslavian League {{could not}} offer. Across the Atlantic, the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA had already used their third round pick on young Petrović in 1986. However, {{he decided to}} {{postpone}} his departure to the United States. In 1988, he signed with Real Madrid instead, for at that time a hefty sum of around US$4 million. The transfer wasn't without controversy as the Yugoslav sporting laws stipulated that players weren't allowed to professionally move abroad until reaching 28 years of age, while Petrović was still only 23 when he signed with the famous Madrid club. In 2014, José Antonio Arízaga, the sports agent who {{played a key role}} in Petrović's summer 1988 transfer from Cibona to Real, recalled a few details from this transaction: [...] "I spoke to Mirko Novosel, Dražen's coach at Cibona, and he told me two things. One, every problem in Yugoslavia can be taken care of with the right amount of money, and two, if Dražen leaves, every other player under 28 will be leaving and it'll be chaos. So, you can imagine all the individuals I had to bribe and all the places where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> up in order to circumvent this law".|$|E
