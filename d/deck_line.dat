5000|$|The {{song was}} written by Pretenders leader Chrissie Hynde, and {{reflected}} her growing interest in environmental and social concerns; the lyrics {{take the form of}} an autobiographical lament, with the singer returning to her childhood home of Ohio and discovering that rampant development and pollution had destroyed the [...] "pretty countryside" [...] of her youth. The song makes a number of specific references to places in and around Akron, Ohio including South Howard Street (line 5), the historic center of Akron which was leveled to make way for an urban plaza with three skyscrapers and two parking <b>decks</b> (<b>line</b> 8).|$|R

Later craft used propellers with three blades.The Admiralty placed orders for 30 LCAs in March 1940. By this time, Thornycroft were subcontracting with South Coast yacht-builders to fill the Admiralty's many small boat orders as Thornycroft yards were overtaxed building war-emergency convoy escorts and the like. Some LCAs - Numbers 24-29 and 51 - were fitted with Parsons conversions of the Ford V8, driving propellers similar to the standard type but on a 2:1 gear reduction; these LCAs did 12 kn at 3,300 revolutions. The standard engine fitted in almost all other craft was the Scripps conversion of the Ford V8. Official trial results for craft built in 1940-1 with this engine show a consistent performance with an unladen speed of 11 kn at 2,800 revolutions. June saw 64 more LCA orders, and then between late September and March 1941 another 104. These early craft {{did not yet have}} the later standard portside armoured Lewis gun position, but nevertheless, had framed canvas hold covers, scaling ladders mounted on the decks amidships, and various other refinements dropped when mass production got into full swing. The finish and performance of these early LCAs were quite fine, which might be expected as these boats were built in established Thornycroft selected yards, but in circumstances of nightly blackouts, air raids, wartime restrictions, and shortages the LCA building programme was a remarkable achievement.|$|E

50|$|The Type XXIII had an {{all-welded}} single hull, {{the first}} submarine {{to use such}} a design. It had a fully streamlined outer casing and apart from the relatively small conning tower and a fairing which housed the Diesel exhaust silencer, it had an uncluttered upper <b>deck.</b> In <b>line</b> with Walter's design practice, there were no forward hydroplanes, although these were added later.|$|R

50|$|Alabamas British-made {{ordnance}} {{was composed}} of six muzzle-loading, broadside, 32-pounder naval smoothbores (three firing to port and three firing to starboard) and two larger and more powerful pivot cannons. The pivot cannons were placed fore and aft of the main mast and positioned roughly amidships along the <b>deck's</b> center <b>line.</b> From those positions, they could be rotated to fire across the port or starboard sides of the cruiser. The fore pivot cannon was a heavy, long-range 100-pounder, 7-inch bore (178 mm) Blakely rifled muzzle-loader; the aft pivot cannon a large, 8-inch (203 mm) smoothbore.|$|R

40|$|Asphalt wear {{surfaces}} cover 1, 378 of Minnesota's timber bridges. This study {{assessed the}} magnitude of premature asphalt deterioration on timber bridges; identified the primary mechanisms responsible for wear surface deterioration; and suggested methods for improving asphalt pavement performance on timber bridges. Research methods included surveys, meetings with several county engineers and tours of their timber bridges, interviews with both asphalt and timber bridge industry professionals, and literature reviews. The study revealed that approximately 50 percent of counties experience some problems with premature reduced serviceability of the asphalt pavement wear surfaces that cover their timber bridges. Possible pavement failure mechanisms include low-temperature cracking, reflective cracking from <b>deck</b> fault <b>lines</b> found at <b>deck</b> panel joint <b>lines</b> and <b>deck</b> lamination separations, asphalt fatigue fracturing, and asphalt de-bonding due to oil preservatives interference. The report presents the following proposed solutions for controlling timber bridge asphalt pavement cracking: asphalt pavement saw & seal, asphalt pavement fabric or material underlay, removal of extruded oil-type preservative before surfacing, conditioning of bridge timbers to the expected equilibrium moisture content before bridge installation, and tightening of timber decks through maintenance practices.
