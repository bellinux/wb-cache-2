Dominance of hatchery steelhead <b>for</b> <b>optimal</b> microhabitats within streams may reduce wild steelhead survival {{as a result of}} reduced foraging opportunity and increased rates of predation.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many of the}} afore-mentioned inhibitors {{share the}} same Hsp90 binding site (either N- or C-terminal), {{it has been shown}} that some of these drugs {{preferentially}} access distinct Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by the extent of their post-translational modification. Though no published inhibitor has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent study has shown that phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide isoform specificity to inhibitor binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation <b>for</b> <b>optimal</b> Hsp90 targeting.|$|E
5|$|Droseraregia {{is often}} {{described}} as being a difficult species to cultivate, though modern reports on its cultivation have indicated which conditions have led to success for some. <b>For</b> <b>optimal</b> growth, D.regia appears to require good soil drainage and sufficient light levels, and prefers cooler temperatures. Cool nights and warm days have been reported to induce vigorous growth. Asexual propagation is frequently achieved through small root cuttings instead of leaf cuttings, which tend to rot before roots can form. Seed germination occurs as early as 10 days to 3 or 4 weeks with fresh seed, faster than many other Drosera species. Germination is phanerocotylar (non-glandular cotyledons exposed, free from seed coverings), with the first true leaves being alternate in arrangement.|$|E
5|$|From May 2010 to July 2011, the {{concentration}} of dissolved oxygen ranged from slightly over 6 milligrams per liter to nearly 17 milligrams per liter. For comparison, the minimum threshold <b>for</b> <b>optimal</b> fish habitation is 5 milligrams per liter. In the aforementioned time period, the lowest concentration occurred in May 2010. The second-lowest concentration, approximately 7 milligrams per liter, occurred in June 2010. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the creek was nearly 17 milligrams per liter in January 2011 and February 2011. The creek has the third-lowest minimum concentration of dissolved oxygen of all named streams in the upper Fishing Creek watershed, including Fishing Creek itself.|$|E

5|$|Lysosomes are organelles {{that contain}} hydrolytic enzymes {{that are used}} for {{intracellular}} digestion. The main functions of a lysosome are to process molecules taken in by the cell and to recycle worn out cell parts. The enzymes inside of lysosomes are acid hydrolases which require an acidic environment <b>for</b> <b>optimal</b> performance. Lysosomes provide such an environment by maintaining a pH of 5.0 inside of the organelle. If a lysosome were to rupture, the enzymes released would not be very active because of the cytosol's neutral pH. However, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.|$|E

In 1806, French chemists Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean Robiquet isolated a compound in asparagus that was subsequently named asparagine, the first amino acid to be discovered. Cystine was discovered in 1810, although its monomer, cysteine, remained undiscovered until 1884. Glycine and leucine {{were discovered in}} 1820. The last of the 20 common amino acids to be discovered was threonine in 1935 by William Cumming Rose, who also determined the essential amino acids and established the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids <b>for</b> <b>optimal</b> growth.|$|E
5|$|Panellus stipticus is one {{of several}} dozen species of fungi that are bioluminescent. Strains from eastern North America are {{typically}} bioluminescent, but those from the Pacific coast regions of North America and from other continents are not. The luminescence is localized to the edges of the gills and the junction of the gills with the stem and cap. Bioluminescence is also observable with mycelia grown in laboratory culture, and the growth conditions <b>for</b> <b>optimal</b> light production have been studied in detail. Several chemicals have been isolated and characterized that are believed to be responsible for light production. Genetic analysis has shown that luminescence is controlled by a single dominant allele. The luminescent glow of this and other fungi inspired the term foxfire, coined by early settlers in eastern and southern North America. Modern research has probed the potential of P.stipticus as a tool in bioremediation, because of its ability to detoxify various environmental pollutants.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper extends {{previous}} studies on learnability in non-acceptable numberings {{by considering the}} question: for which criteria which numberings are <b>optimal,</b> that is, <b>for</b> which numberings it holds that one can learn every learnable class using the given numbering as hypothesis space. Furthermore an effective version of optimality is studied as well. It is shown that the effectively <b>optimal</b> numberings <b>for</b> finite learning are just the acceptable numberings. In contrast to this, there are non-acceptable numberings which are <b>optimal</b> <b>for</b> finite learning and effectively <b>optimal</b> <b>for</b> explanatory, vacillatory and behaviourally correct learning. The numberings effectively <b>optimal</b> <b>for</b> explanatory learning are the K-acceptable numberings. A similar characterization is obtained for the numberings which are effectively <b>optimal</b> <b>for</b> vacillatory learning. Furthermore, it is studied which numberings are <b>optimal</b> <b>for</b> one and not for another criterion: among the criteria of finite, explanatory, vacillatory and behaviourally correct learning all separations can be obtained; however every numbering which is <b>optimal</b> <b>for</b> explanatory learning is also <b>optimal</b> <b>for</b> consistent learning...|$|R
