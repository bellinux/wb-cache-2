5|$|Although {{sufficient}} for the Southern Railway's needs, the Nclass was an ideal test-bed for experiments with new steam technology. The first experiment entailed fitting a Worthington <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> to No.A819 in 1924. The trial was moderately successful, and the pump remained in use until removal in 1927. In June 1930, No.A816 was withdrawn from service {{for the application of}} experimental Anderson steam conservation equipment at Eastleigh Works. This was designed by a Scottish marine draughtsman, Mr. A.P.H. Anderson, who proposed the use of a fan system to condense spent steam and improve draughting of the fire on long-distance runs in regions with poor access to water.|$|E
25|$|Following re-assembly, the {{locomotive}} was steam tested at York before transport to Carrog {{station on the}} Llangollen Railway. Early tests showed up two major problems: firstly the linkage to the blower was not strong enough, and secondly operating the water <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> caused very serious priming of the boiler. It was later shown that the <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> was five {{times the size of}} that required for the engine. This caused air to be fed into the horizontal boiler tube probably caused the priming.|$|E
25|$|On 21 October 1960, Francisco Morazan began {{what was}} to be her last voyage from Miami, Florida. She sailed to Montreal and Toronto, where she {{unloaded}} a cargo of phosphates. Francisco Morazan then sailed to Chicago, arriving there in mid-November. At Chicago, 1,118 tons, 10 cwt of mixed cargo was loaded, destined for Rotterdam, Netherlands and Hamburg, Germany. The cargo included aluminium, baled hair, bottle caps, canned chicken, castings, chemicals, Gilsonite, hides, lard, machinery, phosphate, scrap metal, solder dross, tinplate, and toys. Francisco Morazan departed Chicago on 28 November. Fog on Lake Michigan slowed her progress and a problem with the <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> for the boiler required the ship to be stopped while the pump was repaired. This meant Francisco Morazan was now in a race to leave the Great Lakes before the system closed to navigation on 3 December.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There are {{clinically}} relevant {{discrepancies between}} prescribed volumes and delivered volumes of enteral nutrition (EN) {{in intensive care}} unit (ICU) patients. Next to EN-protocol violations due to insufficient care, we hypothesized technical factors to be responsible for this deficit. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the accuracy of EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems frequently used in the ICU. METHODS: Thirteen commercially available EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pumps</b> with their own delivery systems were tested in 12 sessions with different EN feeding tubes and EN formulas in a laboratory setting. The reproducibility of the measurements was determined for the 8 best performing EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems. RESULTS: There were clinically important differences between prescribed volumes and delivered volumes of EN in the tested EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems. The deficit in volume ranged from + 66 mL (surplus of 66 mL) to - 271 mL (deficit of 271 mL) per 24 hours (14 % of prescribed volume). Viscosity of test fluids (water/EN feeding formulas) and resistance of test tubes had no influence on the delivered volume by the tested EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems, because differences between prescribed volumes and delivered volumes were consistently found for each system while varying these test settings. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between prescribed and delivered EN volumes are caused by the function and construction of EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems. To improve nutrition therapy, the flow rate has to be adjusted or the best-performing EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> has to be purchase...|$|R
50|$|Until 1959, 145 Class 03 {{locomotives}} {{were in the}} Deutsche Bundesbahn's operating fleet, {{of which}} 62 engines (03 005 to 03 122) had air and <b>feed</b> <b>pumps</b> on the smokebox, small leading wheels (850 mm diameter) and {{a top speed of}} 120 km/h, 16 machines (03 127 to 03 160) had air and <b>feed</b> <b>pumps</b> between the middle and rear driving wheels, small leading wheels (850 mm diameter) and a top speed of 120 km/h and 67 engines (03 164 to 03 296) had air and <b>feed</b> <b>pumps</b> between the middle and rear driving wheels, scissor-block brakes (Scherenklotzbremsen), large leading wheels (1,000 mm diameter) and a top speed of 130 km/h.|$|R
50|$|In construction, {{provision}} {{was made on}} site for a fourth generating unit (to {{the north of the}} existing units), including a fourth stack inside the chimney, but the fourth generating unit was cancelled before construction commenced. One design feature of the power station is the lack of steam driven boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pumps,</b> with units 1 and 2 being provided with three 50% electric boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pumps</b> and unit 3 with two 50% electric <b>feed</b> <b>pumps.</b> The main turbo-generator was manufactured by Parsons, and many of the major components were interchangeable with the turbo-generators at Hunterston B around 13 mi south, on the Firth of Clyde, also then owned by the South of Scotland Electricity Board.|$|R
25|$|The unevaporated {{seawater}} in an evaporator gradually {{becomes a}} concentrated brine and, like the early steam boilers with seawater feed, this brine must be intermittently blown down every {{six to eight}} hours and dumped overboard. Early evaporators were simply mounted high-up and dumped their brine by gravity. As the increasing complexity of surface condensers demanded better feedwater quality, a pump {{became part of the}} evaporator equipment. This pump had three combined functions as a seawater <b>feed</b> <b>pump,</b> a fresh water delivery pump and a brine extraction pump, each of progressively smaller capacity. The brine salinity was an important factor in evaporator efficiency: too dense encouraged scale formation, but too little represented a waste of heated seawater. The optimum operating salinity was thus fixed at three times that of seawater, and so the brine pump had to remove at least one third of the total feedwater supply rate. These pumps resembled the steam-powered reciprocating feedwater pumps already in service. They were usually produced by the well-known makers, such as G & J Weir. Vertical and horizontal pumps were used, although horizontal pumps were favoured as they encouraged the de-aeration of feedwater. Electrically powered rotary centrifugal pumps were later adopted, as more efficient and more reliable. There were initial concerns whether these would be capable of pumping brine against the vacuum of the evaporator and so there was also a transitional type where a worm gear-driven plunger pump for brine was driven from the rotary shaft.|$|E
500|$|On 20 June, Eckoldt sailed for Bergen, Norway, with Galster and Schonemann {{where they}} waited until 4 July for the latter's main <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> to be {{repaired}} and for Beitzen and Lody to arrive. All five destroyers arrived at Kirkenes on 10 July. They mounted their first anti-shipping patrol on 12 July, {{but did not}} spot anything until the following night. A small Soviet convoy was spotted and two of its ships were sunk after expending four-fifths of their ammunition. As the German ships were returning to port, they were attacked by several aircraft, of which Eckoldt claimed to have shot down one. A second patrol was made on 22 July, but only a single Soviet ship was sunk while the German ships were not damaged by several aerial attacks. When the British aircraft carriers [...] and [...] attacked Petsamo and Kirkenes on 29 July, the destroyers were far {{to the east and}} could not catch the British ships before they left the area. The German destroyers made one final sortie into the Kola Inlet where they sank one small Soviet patrol vessel. Eckoldt was damaged by a single aircraft's bombs that straddled the ship and damaged her steering and starboard engine. This damage was temporarily repaired, but Eckoldt was ordered to Narvik for more thorough repairs. After they were completed, the ship remained in the Arctic for convoy escort duties. She was accidentally rammed by a Norwegian freighter in Tromsø on 12 October and was given temporary repairs in the floating dock at Trondheim on 22 October before she was sent to Kiel for more permanent repairs where she arrived on 9 November.|$|E
2500|$|Citing {{conditions}} {{similar to}} those that resulted in the 2005 Texas City Refinery explosion, on 25 April 2006, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fined BP more than $2.4 million for unsafe operations at the company's Oregon, Ohio refinery. [...] An OSHA inspection resulted in 32 per-instance willful citations including locating people in vulnerable buildings among the processing units, failing to correct de-pressurization deficiencies and deficiencies with gas monitors, and failing to prevent the use of non-approved electrical equipment in locations in which hazardous concentrations of flammable gases or vapors may exist. [...] BP was further fined for neglecting to develop shutdown procedures and designate responsibilities and to establish a system to promptly address and resolve recommendations made after an incident when a large <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> failed three years prior to 2006. [...] Penalties were also issued for five serious violations, including failure to develop operating procedures for a unit that removes sulfur compound; failure to ensure that operating procedures reflect current operating practice in the Isocracker Unit; failure to resolve process hazard analysis recommendations; failure to resolve process safety management compliance audit items in a timely manner; and failure to periodically inspect pressure piping systems.|$|E
