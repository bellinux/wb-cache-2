40|$|Many <b>farm</b> <b>leases,</b> {{especially}} those between family members, are not written but are verbal 2 ̆ 2 handshake 2 ̆ 2 agreements. Because nothing is in writing, the parties {{may have different}} recollections of their agreement, making lease disputes more difficult to resolve. In legal terms, verbal <b>farm</b> <b>leases</b> in Nebraska may be either 2 ̆ 2 year-to-year 2 ̆ 2 leases or 2 ̆ 2 holdover 2 ̆ 2 leases. Holdover leases result when a written lease terminates but the landlord and tenant continue the lease with an oral agreement, either directly or implied, without entering into a new written lease. The most common legal issue associated with verbal <b>farm</b> <b>leases</b> is how a lease may legally be terminated. For both year-to-year leases and holdover leases, six months advance notice {{must be given to}} legally terminate the lease. However, the lease date (the date from which the six months is counted) is different. In contrast, the termination of a written lease is determined by the terms of the written lease. If nothing is specified, a written lease terminates automatically {{on the last day of}} the lease with no automatic renewal...|$|R
