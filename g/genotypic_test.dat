Methods Resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) in DNA after at least 1 year of virological success [viral load (VL) 50 copies/mL). Kappa's coefficient was used to measure agreement between the DNA and RNA genotypes. Results In patients without VF (n =  130) and with VF (n =  114), RNA and DNA showed resistance to at least one drug of the rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate combination in 8 % and 9 % and in 60 % and 45 %, respectively. For rilpivirine RAMs, correlation between RNA and DNA was higher in patients without VF than in patients with VF (kappa =  0. 60 versus 0. 19, P =  0. 026). Overall, the prevalence of RAMs was lower in DNA than in RNA.

In this study, nine candidate genes of the cytochrome P 450 system have been analyzed to determine their possible association with the formation of RA. These genes are: CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 B 1, CYP 2 B 6, CYP 2 E 1, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 D 6, CYP 2 A 6, CYP 2 C 19 and CYP 3 A 4. Within these genes, 21 single nucleotide polymorphism, SNPs, in 300 French Caucasian individuals (100 RA trio families) were genotyped using single-base-extensions, SBE, in a mass spectrometric analysis by MALDI-TOF-MS (matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization-time-of-flight mass spectometry). The selection of the examined genes was carried out taking into account known associations with RA or other autoimmune disease, as well as known functional variants. Decisive were also the location of the gene and genetic variability. The results of genotyping were used to study polymorphisms on their association with Rheumatoid Arthritis. The statistical analyzes of CYP 2 C 9 rs 1799853 (3011) showed, in the family-based single-marker test, a lower transmission (TDT p-value 0. 021) for the rare allele (3011 -a). The case-control allelic based test shows, there is a protective effect (Odds Ratio 0. 58). In the case-control-based <b>genotypic</b> <b>test</b> this issue could be reproduced (p-value 0. 046). For the rare allele of the CYP 2 A 6 rs 1801272 (3022 -a) the family-based single-marker test shows a lower transmittance (TDT p-value 0. 037).

40|$|To the Editor: Family-based {{association}} {{methods have}} become increasingly popular tools for both fine mapping and candidate gene association studies. Of such methods, the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) has received the most attention [Spielman et al., 1993; Risch and Merikangas, 1996]. This test was originally proposed as an ‘‘allelic’ ’ test of linkage and association which compares transmitted to nontransmitted alleles in parents of cases in a matched analysis [Spielman et al., 1993]. Several {{have pointed out that}} the TDT can also be framed as a <b>genotypic</b> <b>test</b> of linkage and association [Self et al. 1991; Schaid, 1999], similar to the genotype relative risk modeling of Schaid and Sommer [1993], by comparing the case’s transmitted genotype to the set of all possible genotypes for that individual, given the parental genotypes. This ‘‘genotypic’ ’ TDT allows for assessment of genotype relative risks and modeling of particular risk relationships, while the allelic version must make an implicit assumption of multiplicative effects of alleles. Further, this framework allows analysis of individuals, rather than considering chromosomes as the unit of observation, which provides a natural setting for the inclusion o...|$|E
40|$|HIV {{resistance}} to antiretroviral agents {{is a major}} contributory cause of treatment failure. The dynamics of HIV replication, together with patient-, physician-, and drug-related factors, lead to emergence of HIV resistant strains {{in most of the}} patients. Phenotypic assays look for an increase in the antiretroviral drug (ARV) concentration that inhibits 50 % of the growth of the tested HIV strain (IC 50), comparatively with a reference strain cultivated in parallel. <b>Genotypic</b> <b>tests</b> detect resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes by comparing the gene sequences of a resistant virus to those of a wildtype strain that has previously been described. The efficacy of each ARV class and each individual ARV is threatened by specific mutations and resistance mechanisms. In retrospective studies of genotypic or phenotypic resistance testing, baseline resistance tests results were correlated with virological outcomes. There is some evidence from prospective studies that resistance testing may have some benefits when used to choose salvage regimens. However, problems in the areas of test interpretation, patient compliance, availability of active drugs, and technical test performance limit the usefulness of resistance testing in clinical practice.

However, reliance on results of a single test can result in an underestimation of antiretroviral drug resistance. In the present study, we quantified the prevalence of resistance-associated mutations found in recent <b>genotypic</b> <b>tests</b> of 1734 HIV- 1 –infected, treatment-experienced subjects who had at least 3 <b>genotypic</b> <b>tests</b> (genotypicnp 11, 404 tests total; median, 5 tests/subject) and compared it with that of resistance-associated mutations ever detected in these subjects between 1996 and 2004.

Results: Mutations M 306 I (n = 56), M 306 V (n = 18) and M 306 L (n = 3) in M. tuberculosis showed decreased susceptibility to ethambutol. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in 73 % (56 / 77) of embB 306 mutants were at or just above the critical concentration (MICs, 5. 0 to ≤ 12. 5 µg/ml) of ethambutol reflecting borderline (or intermediate) resistance. Eight ethambutol-resistant isolates lacked embB mutations, probably due to mutational alterations elsewhere in the genome.

Knowledge of the viral genotype and drug resistance mutations is crucial for the correct management of these patients. From this point of view, the experience of researchers in the HIV- 1 field and the introduction of the HIV- 1 genotyping resistance test has been fundamental. Several molecular tools are available to assist the provider in interpreting <b>genotypic</b> <b>test</b> results including phylogenetics. However, it should be remembered that antiretroviral drug designs, resistance studies and interpretation systems have been largely based on HIV- 1 subtype B, which has been historically the most prevalent subtype in Western countries.

HIV- 1 non-B subtypes have entered Europe and their prevalence has increased over the last years. In Italy, the estimated percentage of infection with non-B subtypes ranges from 2. 4 % to 19. 4 %.

However, when the disease model is unknown, {{there is no consensus}} on the most powerful test to be used between CA, allelic, and <b>genotypic</b> <b>tests.</b> In this article, we tackle the question of whether CA is best suited to single-locus scanning in GWAS and propose a power comparison of CA against allelic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>tests.</b> Our approach relies on the evaluation of the Taylor decompositions of non-centrality parameters, thus allowing an analytical comparison of the power functions of the tests. Compared to simulation-based comparison, our approach offers the advantage of simultaneously accounting for the multidimensionality of the set of features involved in power functions. Although power for CA depends on the sample size, the case-to-control ratio and the minor allelic frequency (MAF), our results first show that it is largely influenced by the mode of inheritance and a deviation from Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). Furthermore, when compared to other tests, CA is shown to be the most powerful test under a multiplicative disease model or when the single-nucleotide polymorphism largely deviates from HWE. In all other situations, CA lacks in power and differences can be substantial, especially for the recessive mode of inheritance.

The nested reverse transcriptase PCR success rates at viral loads exceeding 1, 000 copies/ml were 98 % for the 2. 1 -kb amplicon that covers the Gag cleavage sites and the protease and reverse transcriptase genes, 92 % for the gp 41 amplicon, and 100 % for the integrase amplicon. We analyzed 4, 465 relevant codons with the HIV- 1 DNA chip genotyping assay and the classic sequence-based method. Key resistance mutations in protease and reverse transcriptase were identified correctly 95 and 92 % of the time, respectively. This test should be a valuable alternative to the standard sequence-based system for HIV- 1 drug resistance monitoring and a useful diagnostic tool for simultaneous multiple genetic analyses...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{etiology}} of complex diseases {{is due to}} the combination of genetic and environmental factors, usually many of them, and each with a small effect. The identification of these small-effect contributing factors is still a demanding task. Clearly, {{there is a need for}} more powerful tests of genetic association, and especially for the identification of rare effects Results: We introduce a new genetic association test based on symbolic dynamics and symbolic entropy. Using a freely available software, we have applied this entropy test, and a conventional test, to simulated and real datasets, to illustrate the method and estimate type I error and power. We have also compared this new entropy test to the Fisher exact test for assessment of association with low-frequency SNPs. The entropy test is generally more powerful than the conventional test, and can be significantly more powerful when the <b>genotypic</b> <b>test</b> is applied to low allele-frequency markers. We have also shown that both the Fisher and Entropy methods are optimal to test for association with lowfrequency SNPs (MAF around 1 - 5 %), and both are conservative for very rare SNPs (MAF< 1 %) Conclusions: We have developed a new, simple, consistent and powerful test to detect genetic association of biallelic/ SNP markers in case-control data, by using symbolic dynamics and symbolic entropy as a measure of gene dependence. We also provide a standard asymptotic distribution of this test statistic. Given that the test is based o...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{efficacy}} of raltegravir plus optimized background therapy (OBT) {{has been demonstrated}} for antiretroviral (ARV) -experienced HIV- 1 -infected patients in randomized clinical trials. We studied viro-immunological response, pharmacokinetic parameters and <b>genotypic</b> <b>test</b> results in an observational cohort of multiple ARV class-experienced patients starting a raltegravir-based regimen. METHODS: Already enrolled ANRS CO 3 Aquitaine Cohort patients with virological failure were {{included in this study}} after starting a raltegravir-based regimen (400 mg twice a day, week 0). Virological success was defined by the plasma HIV- 1 RNA level [viral load (VL) ] or = 1 and or = 2 (P = 0. 02), respectively. Raltegravir-related mutations emerged in 9 of 11 failing patients (82 %) : Q 148 H/R (n = 5), N 155 S/H (n = 3) and S 230 N (n = 1). Median CD 4 increases from week 0 to week 4 and week 24 were 28 (- 4, 85) and 57 (0, 156) cells/mm(3), respectively. A poor immune response was independently associated with a lower VL decline (week 0 to week 12) [odds ratio (OR) : 3. 5, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 4, 8. 4, for 1 log(10) less] and CD 4 +% at baseline (OR: 2. 6, 95 % CI: 0. 97, 8. 3, for 10 % lower). CONCLUSIONS: Raltegravir plus OBT provided a good virological success rate in highly pre-treated patients under clinical routine conditions...|$|E
40|$|Genotypic {{analysis}} {{of resistance to}} isoniazid (INH) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is complex due to the various genes potentially involved. Mutations in ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthase (encoded by kasA) were present in 16 of 160 (10 %) INH-resistant isolates (R 121 K [n = 1], G 269 S [n = 3], G 312 S [n = 11], G 387 D [n = 1]). However, G 312 S was also present in 6 of 32 (19 %) susceptible strains. kasA analysis contributed marginally {{to the performance of}} INH <b>genotypic</b> <b>testing</b> in Singapore. The significance of kasA polymorphisms in INH resistance should be carefully established...|$|R
40|$|<b>Genotypic</b> tropism <b>testing</b> {{methods are}} {{emerging}} {{as the first step}} before prescription of the CCR 5 antagonist maraviroc (MVC) to HIV-infected patients in Europe. Studies validating <b>genotypic</b> <b>tests</b> have included other active drugs that could have poten-tially convoluted the effects of MVC. The maraviroc clinical test (MCT) is an in vivo drug sensitivity test based on the virological response to a short-term exposure toMVCmonotherapy. Thus, our aim was to compare the results of <b>genotypic</b> tropism <b>testing</b> methods with the short-term virological response toMVCmonotherapy. A virological response in theMCTwas defined as a> 1 -log 10 decrease in HIV RNA or undetectability after 8 days of drug exposure. Seventy-three patients undergoing theMCTwere included in this study. We used both standard genotypic methods (n 73) and deep sequencing (n 27) onMCT samples at baseline. For the standard methods, the most widely used genotypic algorithms for analyzing the V 3 loop sequence, geno 2 pheno and PSSM, were used. For deep sequencing, the geno 2 pheno algorithmwas used with a false-positive rate cutoff of 3. 5. The dis-cordance rates between the standard genotypic methods and the virological response were approximately 20 % (including mostly patients without a virological response). Interestingly, these discordance rates were similar to that obtained from deep sequenc-ing (18. 5 %). The discordance rates between the genotypic methods (tropism assays predictive of the use of the CCR 5 coreceptor) and the MCT (in vivoMVC sensitivity assay) indicate that the algorithms used by genotypic methods are still not sufficientl...|$|R
40|$|Drug-resistance testing, or {{antimicrobial}} susceptibility testing (AST), {{is mandatory}} for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in cases of failure on standard therapy. We reviewed the different methods and techniques of phenotypic and genotypic approaches. Although multiresistant and extensively drug-resistant (MDR/XDR) tuberculosis is present worldwide, AST for M.  tuberculosis (AST-MTB) is still mainly performed according to the resources available rather than the drug-resistance rates. Phenotypic methods, i. e. culture-based AST, are commonly used in high-income countries to confirm susceptibility of new cases of tuberculosis. They are also used to detect resistance in tuberculosis cases with risk factors, in combination with <b>genotypic</b> <b>tests.</b> In low-income countries, genotypic methods screening hot-spot mutations known to confer resistance {{were found to be}} easier to perform because they avoid the culture and biosafety constraint. Given that <b>genotypic</b> <b>tests</b> can rapidly detect the prominent mechanisms of resistance, such as the rpoB mutation for rifampicin resistance, we are facing new challenges with the observation of false-resistance (mutations not conferring resistance) and false-susceptibility (mutations different from the common mechanism) results. Phenotypic and genotypic approaches are therefore complementary for obtaining a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting drug resistances and susceptibilities to accurately predict MDR/XDR cure and to gather relevant data for resistance surveillance. Although AST-MTB was established in the 1960 s, there is no consensus reference method for MIC determination against which the numerous AST-MTB techniques can be compared. This information is necessary for assessing in vitro activity and setting breakpoints for future anti-tuberculosis agents...|$|R
