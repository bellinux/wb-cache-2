500|$|Mutchnick said Will was {{originally}} {{going to be}} named Will Herman ("her man") because the staff wanted to use names that [...] "speak exactly to the essence" [...] of the characters. However, they changed it to Truman ("true man") since {{they thought it was}} more accurate, as Will [...] "really lives his life in an honest way". John Barrowman was one of the final candidates for the role of Will, but was rejected because he [...] "wasn't gay enough". The part instead went to Eric McCormack, who revealed that taking the role was not difficult because he liked the concept of a gay show not being about the [...] "issues" [...] of being gay. Having played gay characters several times in his career, McCormack did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and thought his character could become a [...] "poster boy for some gay movement", like DeGeneres became a spokesperson with her character. He explained that when he first read the script, [...] "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was so much like me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and he has great friends and he's a good friend to them ... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing." [...] McCormack was also the first actor to be cast. In response to the relationship between Will and Grace, McCormak said that gay men and straight women have [...] "more fun than anybody" [...] in their relationships; [...] "Straight guys like me are jealous because of how much fun they have. We can show the audience part of that." ...|$|E
