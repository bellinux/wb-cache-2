5|$|Because {{the stacks}} are {{visible from the}} floor of the central hall, the layout of the library is clear to the visitor at a <b>glance,</b> {{which was one of the}} goals the Academy's {{building}} committee had set for Kahn.|$|E
5|$|He {{was one of}} {{the most}} ambitious and {{promising}} of the young princes of the Kamehameha realm. It is believed by old Hawaiians today that had he lived he would have become a real and constructive leader of the Hawaiian people. He had a splendid physique and a magnetic personality. The <b>glance</b> of his eyes made him friends everywhere.|$|E
30|$|A slight {{increase}} in longer <b>glances</b> over 0.8  s was observed when comparing proportions of all ‘other’ <b>glances</b> (from baseline and condition trials) with device <b>glances</b> (Fig.  4). An increase in shorter <b>glances</b> was also evident in the ‘other’ sample while very long <b>glances</b> (> 1.6  s) remained consistent. There is {{no significant difference in}} the number of 2  s <b>glances</b> between the baseline and conditions trials.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Glancing</b> - <b>Glancing</b> {{can show}} a person's true desires. For instance, <b>glancing</b> at a door might mean that {{someone wants to}} leave. <b>Glancing</b> at {{a glass of water}} might mean that a person is thirsty.|$|R
30|$|The {{number of}} <b>glances</b> for all {{junctions}} and by experimental condition {{shows that the}} increase is predominantly due to <b>glances</b> to the device (Fig.  1). Despite some localised differences {{the average number of}} ‘other’ <b>glances</b> between baseline (BL) and condition (CO) trials remained relatively close at 53.8 <b>glances</b> and 52.8 <b>glances</b> respectively. The number of additional device <b>glances</b> instigated by the effect of the condition trial ranged between 14 and 58 (average 38.5). The {{increase in the number of}} <b>glances</b> between baseline and condition is 100  % attributable to the device in 4 participants and 80  % or greater in 5 others, only 1 case shows a lower increase with 31  % of additional <b>glances</b> attributable to the device.|$|R
5|$|It is {{also said}} that on the {{southern}} side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, a <b>glance</b> at any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only steep slopes covered in thorny bushes and trees. Although no obstacle to individuals, such terrain would not be passable by an army and its baggage train.|$|E
5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a <b>glance.</b> Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E
5|$|Centers {{of surface}} high- and {{low-pressure}} {{areas that are}} found within closed isobars on a surface weather analysis are the absolute maxima and minima in the pressure field, and can tell a user in a <b>glance</b> what the general weather is in their vicinity. Weather maps in English-speaking countries will depict their highs as Hs and lows as Ls, while Spanish-speaking countries will depict their highs as As and lows as Bs.|$|E

5|$|Eye {{color is}} {{considered}} a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which at a <b>glance</b> appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red.|$|E
5|$|He first learns of his body's {{superior}} {{resistance to}} physical injury during the war. Bullets and bayonets <b>glance</b> off his tough skin. He {{believes he can}} even survive a plane crash. The only weaponry capable of penetrating his skin at the time are the largest artillery shells. Although, he still feels {{the effects of the}} elements, sweating under the heat of the sun and freezing during winter. Danner's only vulnerability is lightning, which ultimately kills him.|$|E
5|$|Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) first {{encounters}} James Bond (Daniel Craig) {{while on}} an assignment in Shanghai. She helps the mercenary Patrice (Ola Rapace) assassinate an art dealer by leading the target {{in front of}} a window. Bond confronts Patrice about his affiliations, but is unable to coerce any answers before the assassin falls out of a window to his death. Sévérine and Bond exchange a <b>glance</b> before she leaves the room. Bond takes the payment intended for Patrice, a token for a casino in Macau.|$|E

30|$|Certainly {{there are}} {{slightly}} more <b>glances</b> made during motorway driving (MW) with the device active however {{this is not}} true for urban driving (URB) or inter-urban roads (INT) where there is no change and fewer <b>glances</b> respectively. An average for all road types shows this clearly with 368 <b>glances</b> made in the control condition and 367 made during condition (Foot-LITE) driving. Statistical analyses of these data using a students’ t-test was conducted. Overall the numbers of <b>glances</b> made in the control condition did not differ significantly compared to the numbers of <b>glances</b> made in the experimental condition. Furthermore when the data were analysed according to individual road-types (i.e., motorway, urban and inter-urban), there was also no difference in the numbers of <b>glances</b> made in the control and experimental conditions.|$|R
3000|$|... 24 {{participants}} with HL and 24 with NH {{were exposed to}} normal driving and to driving with a secondary task (observation and recall of 4 visually displayed letters). Eye movement behavior was assessed during normal driving by the following performance indicators: number of <b>glances</b> away from the road; mean duration of <b>glances</b> away from the road; maximum duration of <b>glances</b> away from the road; and percentage of time looking at the road. During driving with the secondary task, eye movement data were assessed in terms of number of <b>glances</b> to the secondary task display, mean duration of <b>glances</b> to the secondary task display, and maximum duration of <b>glances</b> to the secondary task display. The secondary task performance was assessed as well, {{counting the number of}} correct letters, the number of skipped letters, and the number of correct letters ignoring order.|$|R
