He had gained his Certificate of Competency as Master of a <b>Home</b> <b>Trade</b> Passenger <b>Ship</b> on 21 August 1865. The Matchless was engaged in the packet trade between Leith and Lerwick, Mainland, Shetland. For the next ten years, until 1875, Nisbet traded in the Matchless between Leith and Shetland. The Matchless was a well known trader in Leith, and at that time was {{recognised}} as one of the finest and fastest clippers sailing out of the port. On one occasion Nisbet went with the Matchless from Lerwick to Leith in 27 hours. Nisbet is reported as saying: [...] "She was a bonnie ship, the Matchless and I think that was the best ten years of my life - the time I was in her." ...|$|R

50|$|Ships {{range from}} single-person courier; small trade craft; private ships; long-loop, family <b>trade</b> <b>ships</b> (depreciated in modern shipping); large <b>trade</b> <b>ships</b> (often {{carrying}} a Master Trader); bulk cargo ships; and large passenger liners. There {{are of course}} many specialty craft for station maintenance, and other utilitarian functions. In this era of relative peace, there is little mention of purpose-built military ships, except for the battleships of the warlike Yxtrang (though mercenary companies have troop ships and various support ships). Planetary governments may have small fleets of fighter craft, for defensive purposes, that operate both in air and near space. It is not uncommon, however, for merchant ships to carry weaponry to defend themselves from pirates and brigands. Some large <b>trade</b> <b>ships,</b> such as Korval's Dutiful Passage, have incorporated enough weaponry to be considered full battleships.|$|R
