2500|$|The {{majority}} of fatalities aboard USAir 1493 occurred to those {{seated in the}} front of the plane, where the post-crash fire originated in the forward cargo hold, fed by a combination of fuel from the wreckage of SkyWest 5569 and gaseous oxygen from the 737's damaged crew oxygen system. Everyone seated in row 6 or forward was either killed or sustained major injuries, while everyone aft of row 17 escaped, some with minor injuries. [...] Only two passengers and one crew member managed to escape from the forward service (R1) door, while the main cabin (L1) door was inoperable due to damage. Only two passengers used the left over-wing exit before the fire became too intense outside the aircraft. The {{majority of}} the survivors exited via the right over-wing exit, with the rest of the surviving cabin occupants escaping through the rear service (R2) door. [...] The rear passenger (L2) door was briefly opened during the course of the accident, but was quickly closed due to the spreading fire on that side of the aircraft. [...] Multiple issues slowed the evacuation from the right over-wing door, including a passenger seated in the exit row who could not open the door, a brief scuffle between two men at the exit, and the seat back of the <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> seat being folded forward, partially obstructing the exit.|$|E

50|$|For the {{purposes}} of evacuation, school buses are equipped {{with a minimum of}} at least one emergency exit in addition to the main entry door. The rear-mounted emergency exit door is a design feature retained from when school buses were horse-drawn wagons and the entrance door was rear-mounted to avoid frightening the horses; in rear-engine school buses, the door is replaced by an <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> supplemented by a side-mounted exit door.|$|E

40|$|Most {{selectivity}} experiments employ {{either the}} covered codend or paired gear methods. It {{is not always}} possible, however, to use these methods. Owing to operational, biological and/or environmental considerations, {{there may be no}} obvious way or it may be inappropriate to pair the test and control data. Hence, it will not be possible to estimate the selectivity of the gear and its uncertainty using standard statistical methods. This study presents a methodology for analysing the selectivity of fishing gears from unpaired test and control data. The uncertainty in the control and test population structures is accounted for by using a double bootstrapping procedure that takes into account both between-haul and within-haul variation. This bootstrapping approach is used to assess the selectivity of two different devices, a 139. 5 mm T 90 codend and a 135. 9 mm codend with 140. 9 mm lateral <b>exit</b> <b>windows,</b> in the Barents Sea pelagic cod trawl fishery. The purpose of the experiment was to test and compare the performance of the two devices in pelagic trawl fisheries, where high densities of fish can be encountered.

50|$|For white beam topography, {{not much}} more is required: most often, a set of slits to {{precisely}} define the beam shape and a (well polished) vacuum <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> will suffice. For those topography techniques requiring a monochromatic x-ray beam, an additional crystal monochromator is mandatory. A typical configuration at synchrotron sources {{is a combination of}} two Silicon crystals, both with surfaces oriented parallel to 111-lattice planes, in geometrically opposite orientation. This guarantees relatively high intensity, good wavelength selectivity (about 1 part in 10000) and the possibility to change the target wavelength without having to change the beam position ("fixed exit").|$|E
5000|$|One {{innovation}} that Carpenter introduced {{during this period}} was a change {{to the design of}} its [...] "Crown RE", mounted on a Spartan Motors chassis. The Crown RE was the first rear-engine school bus to feature an option of a conventional rear emergency door instead of an emergency <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> typical on rear-engine school buses. To make this possible, the floor was slanted up in the last few rows in order to gain height over the engine compartment. Crown by Carpenter also produced a delivery truck loosely derived from its [...] "Cadet" [...] Type B school bus line.|$|E

In addition to the two pilots, the survivors were Howard Goddard (aged 12), Ellen Hounslow (15), Lucille Langley-Williams and Megan Smith. Hounslow spotted that Goddard was struggling in the water, and she swam to help him. None of the six had managed to retrieve a life jacket, and so the two pilots gathered the survivors together, and helped keep them afloat, using suitcases as flotation aids.|$|E

50|$|During {{microbeam}} irradiation, {{cells to}} be irradiated are {{moved to the}} beam position using a high-speed high-resolution three-axis piezo-electric stage. In order to further reduce targeting time, and making use {{of the fact that}} a focused microbeam, unlike a collimated one, is not restricted to a single location on the accelerator <b>exit</b> <b>window,</b> we have implemented a magnetic-coil-based fast deflector, placed between the two quadrupole triplets, that allows deflecting the beam to any position in the field of view of the microscope used to observe the cells during irradiation. Moving the beam to the cell position magnetically can be performed much faster than moving the stage. The deflector used in this system can move the beam to as many as 1000 separate locations per second—more than 5 times the speed of movement of the stage—dramatically reducing the irradiation time.|$|E
50|$|As {{happened}} with the Buffalo Bills in 2014, even franchises with relatively long lease agreements but which are otherwise seen as struggling in their own market, are often named by the media as potential candidates for relocation to London, {{on the basis that}} those advocating relocation to a more lucrative market would be offering more money than those proposing to stay put. In the specific case of the Bills, it was however suggested that the NFL would oppose relocation since they were the only NFL team which played in New York state (the New York Jets and New York Giants being located in a shared stadium in New Jersey). Another problem in moving the Bills is that the team has been non-competitive for over a decade; the team has not even reached the playoffs since 1999, a factor in the failure of the Bills' previous international effort, the Bills Toronto Series. The Bills' lease, which is effectively unbreakable in the short-term, has an <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> in 2019 and expires in 2022.|$|E

40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of x-ray beams typically take {{parameters of the}} electron beam in the accelerating waveguide to be free parameters. In this paper, a methodology is proposed and implemented to determine the energy, spectral width, and beam divergence of the electron source. All treatment head components {{were removed from the}} beam path, leaving only the <b>exit</b> <b>window.</b> With the x-ray target and flattener out of the beam, uncertainties in physical characteristics and relative position of the target and flattening filter, and in spot size, did not contribute to uncertainty in the energy. Beam current was lowered to reduce recombination effects. The measured dose distributions were compared with Monte Carlo simulation of the electron beam through the treatment head to extract the electron source characteristics. For the nominal 6 and 18 MV x-ray beams, the energies were 6. 51 ± 0. 15 and 13. 9 ± 0. 2 MeV, respectively, with the uncertainties resulting from uncertainties in the detector position in the measurement and in the stopping power in the simulations. Gaussian spectral distributions were used, with full widths at half maximum ranging from 20 ± 4 % at 6 MV to 13 ± 4 % at 18 MV required to match the fall-off portion of the percent-depth ionization curve. Profiles at the depth of maximum dose from simulations that used the manufacturer-specified <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> geometry and no beam divergence were 2 – 3 cm narrower than measured profiles. Two simulation configurations yielding the measured profile width were the manufacturer-specified <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> thickness with electron source divergences of 3. 3 ° at 6 MV and 1. 8 ° at 18 MV and an <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> 40 % thicker than the manufacturer’s specification with no beam divergence. With the x-ray target in place (and no flattener), comparison of measured to simulated profiles sets upper limits on the electron source divergences of 0. 2 ° at 6 MV and 0. 1 ° at 18 MV. A method of determining source characteristics without mechanical modification of the treatment head, and therefore feasible in clinics, is presented. The energies and spectral widths determined using this method agree with those determined with only the <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> in the beam path...|$|E
40|$|Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) is an {{ion beam}} {{analysis}} technique. In PIXE, {{atoms in the}} sample are excited when the sample is bombarded with protons, alpha particles, or heavy ions. X-rays are emitted when atoms in the sample de-excite. Each element has unique characteristic x-rays. In the spectrum, area of each peak {{is proportional to the}} elemental concentration in the sample. The existing PIXE set-up in the accelerator laboratory was upgraded to external beam PIXE to do in air measurements, because of need to analyse large amounts of archaeological samples. Different <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> set-ups were constructed and tested. The goal was to get maximum beam spot area with minimum beam energy loss in the <b>exit</b> <b>window.</b> The set-up enables the use of 100 nm thick Si 3 N 4 <b>exit</b> <b>window</b> membranes and 4 -mm-diameter beam spot area. For the measurements in the current work, a 500 nm thick Si 3 N 4 membrane was used due to its higher durability. Current measurement can be difficult when doing PIXE in air because of ionization of air molecules in the beam's path and charge collection differences at sample surface. The set-up utilizes a beam profile monitor (BPM), which measures the current in vacuum prior to the <b>exit</b> <b>window,</b> and therefore is not affected by the current measurement difficulties in air. Along with the BPM, a current integrator was also used in the current measurements. Current integrator was used to collect the charge from the sample holder. These two methods together provided reliable way of current measurement. With the developed set-up, 166 pottery pieces from the neolithic stone age from different parts of Finland, Sweden and Estonia, were measured to determine their elemental concentrations for provenance research. AXIL software was used to analyse the spectra...|$|E

The front door was blocked by collision damage, and there were no emergency <b>exit</b> <b>windows</b> or roof hatches, as found on commercial buses and some school buses of the time.

40|$|When charged {{particles}} {{pass through a}} metal pipe, they are accompanied by an image current on the metal surface. With intense short bunches passing near or even into the metal surface, the peak image current density can be very high. This current may result in substantial temperature rise on the surface, especially in high peak current, multibunch operation. In this paper, we derive an explicit formula for the surface temperature rise due to this previously unrecognized pulsed heating effect and show that this effect dominates the proposed linear coherent light source collimator spoiler and wire scanner heating. Without proper account, it can result in component and instrument failures. The result also applies to optical transition radiation screens, profile screens, wire scanners, <b>exit</b> <b>windows,</b> and targets, which the beam crosses...|$|R
