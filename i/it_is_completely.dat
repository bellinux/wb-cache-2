5|$|Hydrochloric acid can {{therefore}} be used to prepare salts called chlorides. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid, since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> dissociated in water.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium is a hard, silvery, durable {{metal that}} has a high reflectance. Rhodium metal does not {{normally}} form an oxide, even when heated. Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium, but is released on solidification. Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum. It is not attacked by most acids: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|Solid xenon {{changes from}} face-centered cubic (fcc) to {{hexagonal}} close packed (hcp) crystal phase under pressure and begins to turn metallic at about 140GPa, with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> metallic at 155GPa. When metallized, xenon appears sky blue because it absorbs red light and transmits other visible frequencies. Such behavior is unusual for a metal and is explained by the relatively small width of the electron bands in that state.|$|E

5|$|The olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis, {{has been}} found to have photoreceptors in the skin of its tail, {{allowing}} it to detect light and presumably ensuring <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> hidden, including its tail, inside coral holes during the day. While other species have not been tested, Aipysurus laevis possibly is not unique among sea snakes in this respect.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{can form}} alloys {{with many other}} metals. Addition of small {{proportions}} of thorium improves the mechanical strength of magnesium, and thorium-aluminium alloys have been considered {{as a way to}} store thorium in proposed future thorium nuclear reactors. Thorium forms eutectic mixtures with chromium and uranium, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> miscible in both solid and liquid states with its lighter congener cerium.|$|E
5|$|In the Ixodidae, {{the tick}} stays {{in place until}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> engorged. Its weight may {{increase}} by 200 to 600 times as compared to its weight before it started feeding. To accommodate this large expansion, cell division takes place and its cuticle grows larger; the tick may remain attached for days or weeks, depending on species, life stage and host. In the Argasidae, the tick's cuticle stretches to accommodate the fluid ingested but does not grow new cells, {{the weight of the}} tick increasing five to tenfold over the unfed state. The tick then drops off the host and typically remains in the nest or burrow until its host returns to provide its next meal.|$|E

50|$|BRDM-1 entered {{service with}} Soviet Army in 1957. Production {{continued}} until 1966 when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> replaced on production lines by the BRDM-2. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> used {{for several years}} until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> replaced by the BRDM-2. Czechoslovakia used BRDM-1 obr. 1958. Hungary also used BRDM-1 and designed its own armoured scout car based on BRDM-1, FUG.|$|R

5|$|Peggy tries {{in vain to}} {{extinguish}} the flames, but is forced out by her friends and family. Stacey, unaware of the events, heads upstairs to Lily and becomes trapped. She uses the crowbar to smash a boarded-up window and hands Lily over to Ryan, who has climbed a ladder. Peggy realises Phil is still inside {{and returns to the}} building with Billy. They find him trapped beneath a wooden beam, and are able to drag him out to safety. Ryan goes back up the ladder and carries an unconscious Stacey out. Stacey regains consciousness and sees that Lily is safe, and tells Ryan that Lily is his daughter. Peggy stares at the pub as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The greater noctule bat {{belongs to}} the {{suborder}} Microchiroptera and uses echolocation. Echolocation is a perceptual system where echoes are produced by emitting ultrasonic sounds. Echolocation allows bats to compare the outgoing pulse with returning echoes which produces detailed images of the bat's surroundings. With echolocation, bats are able to detect, localize and classify their prey in complete darkness. The greater noctule bat has been observed as only emerging from its roosts well after dusk when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> dark. The greater noctule bat has keen hearing and sense of smell, however its eyes are poorly developed.|$|E
5|$|While {{her mother}} attends the reunion, Emma visits Jordan at his hotel where she meets his teacher, Mr. Nystrom (Jeff Gruich). He takes {{her up to}} Jordan's hotel room but as they enter, Emma sees that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> empty except for a video camera which has been set up. She {{immediately}} becomes suspicious and tries to escape but Nystrom blocks her access to the bedroom door. She locks herself in the bathroom, and comes to the startling realization that Nystrom is Jordan. Nystrom apologizes and tells Emma he will let her go, but when she {{comes out of the}} bathroom he grabs and restrains her.|$|E

5|$|In the {{rebuttal}} phases, {{a witness}} or a rival character provides {{their idea of}} what has happened. The player is able to press them for details, and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what the witness or rival is saying. By doing this, the player gets closer to the truth; it is through confronting suspects during these phases that the player solves the cases. Upon solving a case, the episode is cleared and a new episode is {{made available to the}} player. If the player makes mistakes throughout the game, such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence, attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up, or making incorrect choices, a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases, representing Edgeworth getting further from the truth. If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> emptied, the game ends. By clearing an investigation phase, half of the gauge is restored, and by clearing an episode, the gauge is restored completely.|$|E
5|$|The pileipellis, the {{top layer}} of hyphae in the cap, is a cutis. The cutis is made up of {{cylindrical}} hyphae between 2 and 5µm thick. The inamyloid and thin-walled hyphae are covered in brown granules. The flesh in the cap is made up of cylindrical hyphae from 4 to 7µm wide with thin cell walls. They are all generative hyphae, and run parallel to one another. They can be either inamyloid or only weakly dextrinoid. The flesh in the gills is basically the same as the flesh in the cap, but for the fact that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> inamyloid. The hyphae of the stipitipellis, the uppermost layer in the stem, also form a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae making up the cutis run parallel to one another, and measure from 2.5 to 4.5µm in width, with walls up to 1µm thick. They are encrusted with a brown pigment, and are dextrinoid. The flesh of the stem is made up of generative hyphae running lengthways (that is, up and down the stem). The cells are 5 to 8µm wide, and are smooth and colourless; the cell walls up to 1µm thick. They are dextrinoid. All M.funalis hyphae lack clamp connections.|$|E
