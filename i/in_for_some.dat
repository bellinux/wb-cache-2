Goodwin added that the scene of Snow and Charming releasing the birds was freezing because of the heavy rain. Their scene in the cabin took place on the first day of the episode's production. Her near-death scene involved a real cliff, though the height was exaggerated later using CGI and a green screen; a stunt double stood <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> of the shots.|$|E
5|$|The press {{themselves}} came <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> {{criticism in}} this respect, {{with the group}} Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting complaining that the Times and other media outlets focused {{on the effect of}} Nannygate on white, upper-middle-class women, and excluded the perspective of the actual immigrant childcare workers.|$|E

The {{builders}} left a cavity into the wall and the poor girl with a piece of bread and a mug of water was walled <b>in.</b> <b>For</b> <b>some</b> time her cries for help were heard. Yet her soul could not find the peace and, as a result, she appears on the Baptistery’s window to grieve for her beloved man already for centuries, and also to prove the immortality of love.|$|E

Through he had little prior military background nor experience, he was interested in mastering the military art, and proved to be an adept learner. With Batory's support, he began filling <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> of the roles of Grand Crown Hetman Mikołaj Mielecki, particularly when Mielecki was not present. While not campaigning, he was also instrumental in ensuring that the ongoing political support for the war. In 1580 he was hit by another personal tragedy, as his wife died in labor, together with their child; entering a short period of depression.|$|E

His final first-class match was against Lancashire later that month, where he bowled just seven overs without reward.|$|E

25|$|The film {{performed}} {{well at the}} box office, grossing an estimated $10 million by 1977. Despite this, the film was reviewed negatively by critics for its perceived amateurish production and self-indulgent content, with the fantasy sequences in particular coming <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> of the harshest criticism. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where the band had not performed live {{for over two years}} as a result of being on tax exile. The band were thus unable to promote themselves at home, leaving them out of the public spotlight.|$|E
25|$|His {{praise of}} the poet Thomas Campbell has been cited as one major {{instance}} where Hazlitt's critical judgement proved wrong. Hazlitt can scarcely conceal his enthusiasm for such poems as Gertrude of Wyoming, but neither the poems nor Hazlitt's judgement of them have withstood the test of time. His friends Hunt and Lamb get briefer coverage, and—Hazlitt was never one to mince words—they come <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> relatively gentle chiding amid the praise.

25|$|The FTC's {{decision}} {{to pursue the}} case came <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> criticism. Some commentators, who thought the case title was humorous enough to make extended references to the Superman comics in their commentary, questioned whether the commission's action against a retailer who did not deceive any American consumers was a wise use of its limited resources, and whether {{it might have been}} better to prosecute him in Britain. Another, in the course of criticizing the failings of the European Union's Data Protection Directive when it came to dealing with cloud computing, did not criticize the enforcement action as such but showed that it pointed out how much more work needed to be done in ensuring compliance with the Safe Harbor Program.|$|E
25|$|When WSC players rejoined {{official}} cricket for 1979–80, {{there was}} plenty of debate over the Australian captaincy. Chappell was the far from unanimous choice, but led the Test team in twin series, against England (won 3–0) and West Indies (lost 0–2), and the first triangular ODI series where Australia failed to reach the final. It was a mixed bag of results and the programming came <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> criticism. Chappell led by example in scoring 74 and 124 in the Brisbane Test against the West Indies in his comeback to Test cricket. His 98* guided Australia to victory over England at Sydney, then 114 and 40* extracted a similar result at Melbourne. While he averaged 44 with the bat and claimed seven wickets in the ODIs, a constant shuffling of positions ensured an uneven Australian performance.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 McCarthy's side fell to Tipperary in the Munster semi-final. The qualifiers {{proved a}} happy hunting ground for Waterford as they won {{every one of}} their games in the round robin and topped the group. The men from the Deise later gained revenge on Tipp in the All-Ireland quarter-final before lining out against Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final. Once again the game {{proved to be an}} {{exciting}} and close affair, with neither side gaining any huge lead. Cork led with just seconds remaining in the game when Donal Óg Cusack, Cork's goalkeeper, saved a '65' from going over the bar. The sliothar was subsequently cleared, and Cork won the game by just a single point. After the game McCarthy came <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> criticism, however, the players insisted that he was the men to lead them again for another season.|$|E

25|$|As day broke, the Tigris Corps {{found itself}} {{advancing}} through a heavy fog. On left bank, Younghusband's brigades began their {{advance in the}} mid-morning. Approximately two hours into the advance, the brigades paused in their movements to break for lunch. At midday, the fog began to clear and turn into an unseasonably hot day. As the British and Indian battalions were cooking their food, the Ottoman forces launched a spoiling attack. Even though it was driven back, the left bank Tigris Corps' attack on the left bank was further delayed. Eventually, Younghusband's troops reached their positions and launched their attack. However, the objectives of their attack {{turned out to be}} the center of the left bank defenses. Through the rest of the afternoon, Younghusband's brigades failed to make much headway against the Ottoman defenders. With no cover on the ground, the assault battalions came under fire at long range from rifle, machinegun, and artillery. Few units made it closer than 300 yards before having to dig <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> cover.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the show}} did come <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> criticism. San Jose Mercury News criticized the plot and the casting saying that [...] "the storylines usually involve the {{obligatory}} three-episode-arc drug problems or lost virginity with dialogue {{designed to keep}} a dog up to speed", and that [...] "Whoever at FOX thought Benjamin McKenzie (Ryan on [...] "The O.C.") could pass for anything younger than 25 should be fired". A DVD review was critical of the repetitive plot stating that [...] "the Ryan-Marissa fol-de-rol gets tiresome as it devolves into relentless bad timing", while Entertainment Weekly did not think the acting was always up to scratch, stating [...] "it's unfortunate to have all this potential for arm-flinging drama invested in Barton, an actress who can be as flat as a paper doll". It was also denounced for excessive brawling and glamorizing underage drinking.|$|E

500|$|Dolan {{gave him}} a {{contract}} for the 2000–01 season and appointed him as York's captain despite the concerns over his knee. Swan battled against his own body to play all the pre-season friendlies, including a clash with Manchester United and their star players of David Beckham, Roy Keane, Ryan Giggs, and Paul Scholes. He was sent off {{in the first game}} of the season after attempting to headbutt Chesterfield's Steve Blatherwick. He captained the [...] "Minstermen" [...] for the first and only time at Bootham Crescent against Cheltenham Town, before he went <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> keyhole surgery to clean out his knee. The surgeon told Swan that [...] "the mess in there is unbelievable... there's no cartilage, there are bits floating around everywhere and it's riddled with arthritis" [...] and warned him that any further matches could see him confined to a wheelchair. After a few weeks Swan accepted both Dolan's and the surgeon's advice and retired.|$|E
500|$|Supervising Music Editor David Klotz {{received}} a Best Sound Editing: Short Form Musical in Television nomination at the 2012 Golden Reel Awards {{for his work}} on the episode. The musical performances were generally well received by reviewers, though a few songs came <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> criticism. One that was given near-universal plaudits was [...] "America", from Hankinson's [...] "awesome" [...] to Hyman's [...] "killer rendition" [...] to VanDerWerff's [...] "one of the best production numbers the show has ever done". The most frequent caveat seemed to be the accents used by the singers; Flandez thought they [...] "could've used a little finesse", and Futterman characterized them as [...] "questionable", though both complimented the performance's dance moves. Santana's performance in the number and the show came in for particular comment: The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg called her [...] "completely captivating as Anita", and Rae Votta of Billboard mentioned her [...] "two stand out vocal performances".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was positive overall. Robin Denselow of The Guardian awarded the album four of five stars and wrote that Wainwright's performance sounded as [...] "easy-going and spontaneous" [...] and it does at his live concerts. Denselow considered [...] "House" [...] to be the album's best track. The Daily Telegraph Colin Irwin described the album as [...] "oddly uplifting" [...] despite its [...] "variants on the theme that we're all doomed" [...] from the economic crisis. The Observer contributor Neil Spencer wrote that [...] "while [...] tone becomes shrill at times, his mix of nihilism and jauntiness (with ukulele) are finally uplifting." [...] Music journalist Andy Gill of The Independent recommended the tracks [...] "House", [...] "Fear Itself [...] " [...] and [...] "The Panic Is On". Simmy Richman's review for The Independent complimented Wainwright's ability to address current issues [...] "simply and effectively", claiming [...] "Wainwright can make you laugh, nod in agreement, shake your fist in despair and want to sing along". Richman appreciated Wainwright's honesty and humor and wrote that he displayed [...] "better lyrical form than he has been <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time". The Independent included 10 Songs on their [...] "Indy Choice: Best of the New Music" [...] list for the week of July 16, 2010. PopMatters' Alex Ramon preferred Wainwright's album Social Studies (1999), but considered 10 Songs to be [...] "an enjoyable effort nonetheless", complimenting it for its simple approach. Furthermore, Ramon wrote that the album [...] "succeeds in getting you smiling rather than despairing at the mess we're in, and that's {{always been one of}} Wainwright's great gifts".|$|E
