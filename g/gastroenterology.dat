25|$|The European Society of Pediatric <b>Gastroenterology,</b> Hepatology, and Nutrition Committee on Nutrition found {{evidence}} to support short term effects of ingesting prebiotics on stool microflora of infants with increased {{in the number of}} bifidobacteria. Babies can be at risk of dehydration with the induction of softer stools, if they have the kidney immaturity and/or a poor ability to concentrate urine. A reduction of pathogens has been associated with the consumption of prebiotics. However, there was no {{evidence to support}} major clinical or long-term benefits. Therefore, there is little evidence of beneficial effects of prebiotics in dietary products.|$|E
25|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} (usually simply {{referred to}} as intubation), an invasive medical procedure, is the placement of a flexible plastic catheter into the trachea. For millennia, tracheotomy was considered the most reliable (and most risky) method of tracheal intubation. By the late 19th century, advances in the sciences of anatomy and physiology, {{as well as the}} beginnings of an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had reduced the morbidity and mortality of this operation to a more acceptable rate. Also in the late 19th century, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved {{to such a degree that}} direct laryngoscopy had finally become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation was not widely practiced until the early 20th century. The 20th century saw the transformation of the practices of tracheotomy, endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation from rarely employed procedures to essential components of the practices of anesthesia, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, <b>gastroenterology,</b> pulmonology and surgery.|$|E
25|$|With experience, Nwokolo {{carried out}} medical {{research}} in the wards {{as well as in}} the field. He did major research in endomyocardial fibrosis, endemic goitre, sickle-cell disease and other areas of national need. Fieldwork was usually done during weekends, and included travelling in his car to different locations in Eastern Nigeria plus Northern and Mid-Western Nigeria, as well as to Obudu. Nwokolo published about nine papers based on his research while in the civil service. On the strength of his research and papers, he was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (F.R.C.P.) in 1960, based on recommendations by his boss: professor Alexander Brown and professor Harold Scaborough, a visiting scholar from University of Wales. Nwokolo was also invited to teach as senior lecturer at University College Ibadan by professor Brown. In addition, working with the Rockefeller Foundation, professor Brown recommended Nwokolo for a research fellowship in <b>gastroenterology</b> at the University of Minnesota.|$|E
25|$|Andrew K. Burroughs (26 May 1953 Beckenham, Kent - 15 March 2014) was a British physician, {{researcher}} and teacher.

25|$|With over 400 medical {{research}} facilities and 76 medical magazine indexes {{available in the}} country, Iran is the 19th country in {{medical research}} and is set to become the 10th within 10 years (2012). Clinical sciences are invested in highly in Iran. In areas such as rheumatology, hematology, and bone marrow trasplantation, Iranian medical scientists publish regularly. The Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Research Center (HORC) of Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Shariati Hospital was established in 1991. Internationally, this center {{is one of the}} largest bone marrow transplantation centers and has carried out a large number of successful transplantations. According to a study conducted in 2005, associated specialized pediatric hematology and oncology (PHO) services exist in almost all major cities throughout the country, where 43 board-certified or eligible pediatric hematologist–oncologists are giving care to children suffering from cancer or hematological disorders. Three children's medical centers at universities have approved PHO fellowship programs. Besides hematology, <b>gastroenterology</b> has recently attracted many talented medical students. The gasteroenterology research center based at Tehran University has produced increasing numbers of scientific publications since its establishment.|$|E

500|$|Dr Jean-Martin Charcot, {{working at}} the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, France, is {{credited}} with early reports of cholangitis, {{as well as his}} eponymous triad, in 1877. He referred to the condition as [...] "hepatic fever" [...] (fièvre hépatique). Dr Benedict M. Reynolds, an American surgeon, reignited interest in the condition in his 1959 report with colleague Dr Everett L. Dargan, and formulated the pentad that carries his name. It remained a condition generally treated by surgeons, with exploration of the bile duct and excision of gallstones, until the ascendancy of ERCP in 1968. ERCP is generally performed by internal medicine or <b>gastroenterology</b> specialists. In 1992 it was shown that ERCP was generally safer than surgical intervention in ascending cholangitis.|$|E
500|$|Treatment {{of acute}} {{rotavirus}} infection is nonspecific and involves management of symptoms and, most importantly, management of dehydration. If untreated, children can {{die from the}} resulting severe dehydration. [...] Depending on the severity of diarrhoea, treatment consists of oral rehydration therapy, during which the child is given extra water to drink that contains small amounts of salt and sugar. In 2004, the WHO and UNICEF recommended the use of low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution and zinc supplementation as a two-pronged treatment of acute diarrhoea. Some infections are serious enough to warrant hospitalisation where fluids are given by intravenous therapy or nasogastric intubation, and the child's electrolytes and blood sugar are monitored. Probiotics {{have been shown to}} reduce the duration of rotavirus diarrhoea, and according to the European Society for Pediatric <b>Gastroenterology</b> [...] "effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii, diosmectite or racecadotril." [...] Rotavirus infections rarely cause other complications and for a well managed child the prognosis is excellent.|$|E
