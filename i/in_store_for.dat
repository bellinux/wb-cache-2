40|$|The {{effect of}} {{buckwheat}} seed storage duration on major indices {{of the quality}} was analyzed.

The results of investigation have shown that seed stored {{up to two years}} had preserved its good production traits. Seed stored longer than two years have shown poor quality traits, and seed stored over three years could not be used - its production traits (germination energy and total germination) confirmed that such seed could not be used <b>for</b> planting. Seed <b>stored</b> over five years, regardless of storage conditions, had no qualitative traits, and therefore no value. It was also observed that longer storage duration induced decrease of seed mass. In regard to fractions, it was observed that smaller fractions lost their quality more quickly than medium fractions...|$|R

25|$|Jean Pierre-Bloch {{was the son}} of an {{industrialist}} {{and received}} a law degree from the Sorbonne. He joined the SFIO {{at the end of the}} 1920s and became a journalist for Populaire, the daily newspaper of the socialist party. His political career began in 1934, when he was elected general councilor for the Aisne département (a post he would hold until 1967). He shored up his local base by becoming adjunct to the mayor of Laon the following year. In 1936 he became, with the victory of the Popular Front, the youngest deputy in the French National Assembly. In 1938, Jean Pierre-Bloch was one of few parliamentarians to oppose the Munich Agreement. As a Jew, he was particularly concerned by the fate <b>in</b> <b>store</b> <b>for</b> the Jews of Adolf Hitler's Germany.|$|E

Despite only playing two seasons at Real Madrid, he was voted the 12th-best player in Real Madrid history in an internet survey by Spanish newspaper Marca when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2002. While playing with Barcelona, he participated in the 5–0 victory over rivals Real Madrid in the 1993–94 season.

25|$|On 20 May 1802, Napoleon {{signed a}} law to {{maintain}} slavery where it had not yet disappeared, namely Martinique, Tobago, and Saint Lucia. A confidential copy of this decree was sent to Leclerc, who was authorized to restore slavery in Saint-Domingue when the time was opportune. At the same time, further edicts stripped the gens de couleur of their newly won civil rights. None of these decrees were published or executed in St. Domingue, but, by midsummer, word began to reach the colony of the French intention to restore slavery. The betrayal of Toussaint and news of French actions in Martinique undermined the collaboration of leaders such as Dessalines, Christophe, and Pétion. Convinced that the same fate lay <b>in</b> <b>store</b> <b>for</b> Saint-Domingue, these commanders and others once again battled Leclerc. With the French intent on reconquest and re-enslavement of the colony's black population, the war became a bloody struggle of atrocity and attrition. The rainy season brought yellow fever and malaria, which took a heavy toll on the invaders. By November, when Leclerc died of yellow fever, 24,000 French soldiers were dead and 8,000 were hospitalized, the majority from disease.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his 227 receiving yards, Carter had a 30-yard carry and returned two punts for 21 yards. Vikings lineman Chris Doleman had two sacks. Wilson completed 20/34 passes for 298 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. Nelson finished the day a perfect 5/5 on field goals, a notable contrast to his lowly 13/24 performance during the regular season. Montana was held to just 12/26 completions for 109 yards with one interception. Young had a solid performance with 12/17 completions for 158 yards and a touchdown, with one interception, while also leading San Francisco in rushing with 72 yards on six carries. It {{was a sign of}} what lay <b>in</b> <b>store</b> <b>for</b> 49ers fans, as they would watch him and Montana compete fiercely for the starting quarterback job until Young inherited the starting position when Joe Montana suffered a serious elbow injury during the 1991 preseason. Until the 2007–08 NFL playoffs with the Cowboys losing to the Giants, this was the last time the No. 1 seed in the NFC did not advance to the NFC Championship Game. Oddly, after the Cowboys loss, three of the next four No. 1 seeds in the NFC would lose their first playoff game (2008 Giants, 2010 Falcons and 2011 Packers).|$|E
25|$|Geoff Pullar (56) and David Sheppard (53) added 114 for {{the first}}-wicket in 147 minutes, {{the first century}} opening stand for England in Australia since 1946-47. But they batted slowly and the left-handed Lancastrian never settled down properly. He edged a {{boundary}} through the slips, nearly chopped McKenzie onto his stumps and was dropped by Jarman. In the end Alan Davidson (3/43) slowed down his pace and had him caught and bowled after lunch. This brought Ted Dexter striding to the crease {{and he began to}} thump the ball off the boundary fence to take England to 182/2 by tea. Colin Cowdrey (9) was caught-and-bowled by Benaud (1/71) after the break, but Dexter and Ken Barrington hit 66 runs in 86 minutes to keep the game going. They were both out on 257, Dexter yorked by McKenzie (2/61) after a magnificent 99 - few doubted that he deserved a century - and Barrington caught off Davidson for 23. This ended any chance of England winning the game - they now needed 121 runs in 40 minutes - and the Australian fielders crowded around the wicket, but there was no miracle <b>in</b> <b>store</b> <b>for</b> them either. Peter Parfitt was caught by Jarman off McKenzie, but Fred Titmus and Barry Knight batted out the last half hour and they finished on 278/6.|$|E
