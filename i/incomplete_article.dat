Even if the exhaustion doctrine is applicable to the sale of an <b>incomplete</b> <b>article,</b> however, there is a separate analysis of whether the sale of that article was actually authorized, and therefore whether exhaustion was actually triggered.|$|E

40|$|Background: Media {{coverage}} of the vegetative state (VS) includes refutations of the VS diagnosis and describes behaviors inconsistent with VS. We used a quality score to assess the reporting in articles describing the medical characteristics of VS in Italian newspapers. Methodology/Principal Findings: Our search covered a 7 -month period from July 1, 2008, to February 28, 2009, using the online searchable databases of four major Italian newspapers: Corriere della Sera, La Repubblica, La Stampa, and Avvenire. Medical reporting was judged as complete if three core VS characteristics were described: patient unawareness of self and the environment, preserved wakefulness (eyes open), and spontaneous respiration (artificial ventilator not needed). We retrieved 2, 099 articles, and 967 were dedicated to VS. Of these, 853 (88. 2 %) were non-medical and mainly focused on describing the political, legal, and ethical aspects of VS. Of the 114 (11. 8 %) medical articles, 53 (5. 5 %) discussed other medical problems such as death by dehydration, artificial nutrition, neuroimaging, brain death, or uterine hemorrhage, and 61 (6. 3 %) described VS. Of these 61, only 18 (1. 9 %) reported all three CORE characteristics and were judged complete. We found no differences among the four investigated newspapers (Fisher’s exact = 0. 798), and <b>incomplete</b> <b>articles</b> were equally distributed between journalistic pieces and expert opinions (x 2 = 1. 8854, P = 0. 170).

In that case, the patent holder sold lens blanks {{which had to be}} ground into finished lenses — the patented invention. The Court held that this sale exhausted the patents on the finished lenses because the lens blanks substantially “embodied essential features of the patented device and were without utility until [...] [...] [...] ground and polished as the finished lens of the patent.” The Court noted that the grinding process was standard (conventional) and not central to the patents, indicating further that the lens blanks constituted a material part of the patented invention and all but completely practiced the patent, since only conventional further processing steps were needed to complete the invention.|$|E

Nine hundred and twenty three references were verified for their accuracy. Seventy seven percent of the references had citation errors. The errors were classified as major and minor errors.

Minor errors included: punctuations, <b>incomplete</b> <b>article</b> titles, and incomplete author names. The study found that 39. 54 percent of the references contained major errors. Misspelling author(s) name (21. 77 %), misspelling of titles (37. 93 %), mistakes in volume (5. 76 %) and issue numbers (1. 15 %), mistakes in year (37. 66 %) and page numbers (62. 33 %) were kinds of major errors found in the study.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} {{conceptualization}} of the term governance on public mental health programs. METHODS In this systematic review, we analyzed the scientific literature published in the international scenario during 15 years (from 2000 to 2015). The databases analyzed were: Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO and PubMed. Governance and mental health were the descriptors. We included relevant articles according to our subject of study and levels of analysis: (i) the concept of governance in mental health; (ii) process and decision spaces; (iii) strategic and pertinent actors who operate in {{the functioning of the}} health system, and (iv) social regulations. We excluded letters to the editor, news articles, comments and case reports, <b>incomplete</b> <b>articles</b> and articles whose approach did not include the object of study of this review. RESULTS We have found five conceptualizations of the term governance on mental health in the area of provision policies and service organization. The agents were both those who offer and those who receive the services: we identified several social norms. CONCLUSIONS The concept of governance in mental health includes standards of quality and attention centered on the patient, and incorporates the consumers of mental healthcare in the decision-making process...|$|R

40|$|Drawing on {{insights}} from both medical sociology {{and science and}} technology studies this article provides a critical analysis {{of the nature and}} status of pharmaceuticalisation in terms of the following key dimensions and dynamics: (i) the redefinition or reconfiguration of health 'problems' as having a pharmaceutical solution; (ii) changing forms of governance; (iii) mediation; (iv) the creation of new techno-social identities and the mobilisation of patient or consumer groups around drugs; (v) the use of drugs for non-medical purposes and the creation of new consumer markets; and, finally, (vi) drug innovation and the colonisation of health futures. Pharmaceuticalisation, we argue, is therefore best viewed in terms of a number of heterogeneous socio-technical processes that operate at multiple macro-levels and micro-levels that are often only partial or <b>incomplete.</b> The <b>article</b> concludes by drawing out some broader conceptual and reflexive issues this raises as to how we might best understand pharmaceuticalisation, based on our analysis, as a framework for future sociological work in this field...|$|R
