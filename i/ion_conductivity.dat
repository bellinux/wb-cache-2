Polymer blends were prepared by twin-screw extrusion and then compressed by means of a hot-press device into thin films of 125 µm and then ionic sides were created by solid state sulfonation in a chlorosulfonic acid solution.

Ceramic {{solid electrolyte}}s (CSEs) of the NASICON type (e.g., Li1−xAxM2−x(PO4)3 with A ∈ Sc, Y and M ∈ Ge) is one family of Li+ conducting materials that has been studied.
