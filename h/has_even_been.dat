5|$|A {{relative}} {{unknown in}} his first couple of seasons in the NHL, his last name, which is pronounced phonetically (Bee-ek-sa), was frequently mispronounced by sports newscasters and hockey broadcasters such as Bob Cole and Harry Neale of Hockey Night in Canada. It <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> misspelled on scoreboards.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the cats}} were {{registered}} as Abyssinians in the import certificates, {{and because the}} Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese, some have speculated that the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> described as such by CFA Judges. The resemblance of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, {{as well as the}} Singapura's small litter size, which is uncommon in natural breeds, added more doubts to the Meadows' story.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the roles}} and {{importance}} of {{the various forms of}} vitamin E are presently unclear, and it <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> suggested that the most important function of α-tocopherol is as a signaling molecule, with this molecule having no significant role in antioxidant metabolism. The functions of the other forms of vitamin E are even less well understood, although γ-tocopherol is a nucleophile that may react with electrophilic mutagens, and tocotrienols may be important in protecting neurons from damage.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{has also}} been {{detected}} in numerous Solar System environments, including Mercury's atmosphere, the exosphere of the Moon, and numerous other bodies. Some comets have a sodium tail, which was first detected in observations of Comet Hale-Bopp in 1997. Sodium <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> detected in the atmospheres of some extrasolar planets via transit spectroscopy.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{ended in}} victory for Dutthagamani's forces and {{considerably}} weakened Elara's army, ultimately leading to his defeat and death. The exact location of Vijithapura is unknown, though historians {{have made some}} speculations on this. The battle is still regarded by Sri Lankans as a legendary event in the country's history, and <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> compared with victories of the Sri Lanka Army during the country's civil war.|$|E
5|$|Belton House is a Grade I listed {{country house}} in Belton near Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. The mansion is {{surrounded}} by formal gardens {{and a series of}} avenues leading to follies within a larger wooded park. Belton {{has been described as a}} compilation of all that is finest of Carolean architecture, the only truly vernacular style of architecture that England had produced since the Tudor period. The house has also been described as the most complete example of a typical English country house; the claim <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> made that Belton's principal facade was the inspiration for the modern British motorway signs which give directions to stately homes. Only Brympton d'Evercy has been similarly lauded as the perfect English country house.|$|E
5|$|Berlioz's {{version is}} one of many which combine the Italian and French scores, {{although}} it is the most influential and well regarded. Since about 1870 three-act adaptations of the Berlioz score, translating it back into Italian and restoring much of the music from the 1774 French version which Berlioz had left out, were common. An 1889 edition for contralto, published by Ricordi, became the most popular. On occasion the role of Orfeo <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> transposed down an octave for a baritone to sing. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hermann Prey are two notable baritones who have performed the role in Germany. Fischer-Dieskau recorded the opera several times; his recordings are still available commercially.|$|E

5|$|Born on 14 March 1822 in Naples, TeresaCristina {{became an}} orphan {{when her father}} died in 1830. Her mother {{is said to have}} {{neglected}} her after marrying a young officer in 1839. Historiography has long asserted that she was raised in lonely isolation, in an environment of religious superstition, intolerance and conservatism. It has also described Teresa Cristina as a soft and timid character, unlike her ruthless father or her impulsive mother. She <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> depicted as unassertive, and accustomed to be satisfied in whatever circumstances she found herself.|$|E
5|$|Despite much speculation, {{there is}} no {{definitive}} explanation of either Linnaeus fils or Herbert's thinking. For instance the 'Knight's Star' {{has been compared to}} Linnaeus' decoration as a Knight of the Order of the Polar Star. The Latin word equestris (of a knight, or horseman) may have been confused with equi (of a horse), or possibly Herbert was making a literary Knight's Move on the Linnaean term. The flower name <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> compared to the mediaeval weapon, the spoked mace or Morning Star which it superficially resembles.|$|E
5|$|Electroporation is {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in bilayer permeability induced by {{the application of a}} large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core. Because of this, electroporation {{is one of the key}} methods of transfection as well as bacterial transformation. It <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> proposed that electroporation resulting from lightning strikes could be a mechanism of natural horizontal gene transfer.|$|E

5|$|Locomotor {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by Mesopropithecus; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, {{seen in the}} ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus; and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once exhibited {{by many of the}} sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> reported to be a good swimmer. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E
5|$|Merit is {{connected}} with the notions of purity and goodness. Before Buddhism, merit was used with regard to ancestor worship, but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. Merit is a force that results from good deeds done; {{it is capable of}} attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next lives to come, as well as the destination a person is reborn. The opposite of merit is demerit (papa), and it is believed that merit is able to weaken demerit. Indeed, merit <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> connected to the path to Nirvana itself, but many scholars say that this refers only to some types of merit.|$|E
5|$|New {{drugs are}} the {{products}} of a long drug development process, {{the first step of}} which is often the discovery of a new enzyme inhibitor. In the past the only way to discover these new inhibitors was by trial and error: screening huge libraries of compounds against a target enzyme and hoping that some useful leads would emerge. This brute force approach is still successful and <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> extended by combinatorial chemistry approaches that quickly produce large numbers of novel compounds and high-throughput screening technology to rapidly screen these huge chemical libraries for useful inhibitors.|$|E

5|$|Spurred by the crisis, on 1 April 286, Maximian took up {{the title}} of Augustus. His {{appointment}} is unusual {{in that it was}} impossible for Diocletian to have been present to witness the event. It <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> suggested that Maximian usurped the title and was only later recognized by Diocletian in hopes of avoiding civil war. This suggestion is unpopular, as it is clear that Diocletian meant for Maximian to act {{with a certain amount of}} independence. It may be posited, however, that Diocletian felt the need to bind Maximian closer to him, by making him his empowered associate, in order to avoid the possibility of having him striking some sort of deal with Carausius.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is August to January {{with one or}} two broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by hopping around the area. Unlike other robins, the female sometimes initiates the site selection. A pair spends anywhere from one to five days looking before finding a suitable site. The female constructs the nest alone. Eucalypts are generally chosen, but birds have been recorded nesting in Pinus radiata on Mount Wellington in Tasmania. The flame robin is more versatile in its selection of nesting sites than other robins, and <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> recorded nesting in sheds.|$|E
5|$|The {{execution}} prompts the ESU team into action. They plan {{to storm}} {{the bank and}} use rubber bullets to knock out those inside. Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a listening device on the police; aware of the police plans, the robbers detonate smoke grenades and release the hostages. The police detain and question everyone but are unable to distinguish the identically dressed hostages from the robbers. A search of the bank reveals the robbers' weapons were plastic replicas. They find props for faking the execution, but no money or valuables {{appear to have been}} stolen. With no way to identify the suspects and unsure if a crime <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> committed, Frazier's superior orders him to drop the case.|$|E
