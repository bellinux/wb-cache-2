2500|$|Since Usher {{syndrome}} {{results from}} the loss of a gene, gene therapy that adds the proper protein back ("gene replacement") may alleviate it, provided the added protein becomes functional. [...] Recent studies of mouse models have shown one form of the disease—that associated with a mutation in myosin VIIa—can be alleviated by replacing the mutant gene using a lentivirus. However, some of the mutated genes associated with Usher syndrome encode very large proteins—most notably, the USH2A and GPR98 proteins, which have roughly 6000 amino-acid residues. <b>Gene</b> <b>replacement</b> therapy for such large proteins may be difficult.|$|E

It has been known that survival factors and antiapoptoic reagents can be an alternative treatment if the mutation is unknown for <b>gene</b> <b>replacement</b> therapy. [...] Some scientists have experimented with treating this issue by injecting substitute trophic factors into the eye. One group of researchers injected the rod derived cone viability factor (RdCVF) protein (encoded for by the Nxnl1 (Txnl6) gene) into the eye of the most commonly occurring dominant RP mutation rat models. This treatment demonstrated success in promoting the survival of cone activity, but the treatment served even more significantly to prevent progression of the disease by increasing the actual function of the cones. Experiments were also carried out [...] to study whether supplying AAV2 vectors with cDNA for [...] glial cell line-derived [...] neurotrophic factor (GDNF) can have an [...] anti-apoptosis effect on the rod cells.|$|E
40|$|P>Genes {{introduced}} by <b>gene</b> <b>replacements</b> {{and other types}} of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) represent a significant presence in many archaeal and eubacterial genomes. Most alien genes are likely to be neutral or deleterious upon arrival and their long-term persistence may require a mechanism that improves their selective contribution. To examine the fate of inter-species <b>gene</b> <b>replacements,</b> we exchanged three native S. typhimurium genes encoding ribosomal proteins with orthologues from various other microbes. The results show that replacement of each of these three genes reduces fitness {{to such an extent that}} it would provide an effective barrier against inter-species <b>gene</b> <b>replacements</b> in eubacterial populations. However, these fitness defects could be partially ameliorated by gene amplification that augmented the dosage of the heterologous proteins. This suggests that suboptimal expression is a common fitness constraint for inter-species <b>gene</b> <b>replacements,</b> with fitness costs conferred by either a lower expression level of the alien protein compared with the native protein or a requirement for an increased amount of the alien protein to maintain proper function. Our findings can explain the observation that duplicated genes are over-represented among horizontally transferred genes, and suggest a potential coupling between compensatory gene amplification after HGT and the evolution of new genes...|$|R

Most commonly, dsDNA recombineering {{has been used to}} create <b>gene</b> <b>replacements,</b> deletions, insertions, and inversions. Gene cloning [...] and gene/protein tagging (His tags etc., see [...] ) is also common. For <b>gene</b> <b>replacements</b> or deletions, usually a cassette encoding a drug-resistance gene is made by PCR using bi-partite primers. These primers consist of (from 5’→3’) 50 bases of homology to the target region, where the cassette is to be inserted, followed by 20 bases to prime the drug resistant cassette. The exact junction sequence of the final construct is determined by primer design. These events typically occur at a frequency of approximately 104/108cells that survive electroporation.

40|$|We {{have used}} double gene {{targeting}} to create homozygous <b>gene</b> <b>replacements</b> in the protozoan parasite Leishmania major, an asexual diploid. This method uses two independent selectable markers in successive rounds of gene targeting to replace both alleles of an endogenous gene. We developed an improved hygromycin B-resistance cassette encoding hygromycin phosphotransferase (HYG) {{for use as}} a selectable marker for Leishmania. HYG-containing vectors functioned equivalently to those containing the neomycin phosphotransferase (NEO) cassette previously used for extrachromosomal transformation or gene targeting. Drug resistances conferred by the NEO and HYG markers were independent, allowing simultaneous selection for both markers. A HYG targeting vector was utilized to replace the single dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) gene remaining in a line heterozygous for a NEO replacement at the dhfr-ts locus (+/neo), with a targeting efficiency comparable to that seen with wild-type recipients. The resultant dhfr-ts- line (hyg/neo) was auxotrophic for thymidine. The double targeted replacement method will enable functional genetic testing in a variety of asexual diploids, including cultured mammalian cells and fungi such as Candida albicans. Additionally, {{it may be possible to}} use Leishmania bearing conditionally auxotrophic <b>gene</b> <b>replacements</b> as safe, improved live vaccines for leishmaniasis...|$|R

The 8. 7 -Mb Streptomyces coelicolor genome was {{previously}} sequenced {{by using an}} ordered library of Supercos- 1 clones. Here, we describe an efficient procedure for creating precise <b>gene</b> <b>replacements</b> in the cosmid clones by using PCR targeting and A-Red-mediated recombination. The cloned Streptomyces genes are replaced with a cassette containing a selectable antibiotic resistance and oriT(RK 2) for efficient transfer to Streptomyces by RP 4 -mediated intergeneric conjugation. Supercos- 1 does not replicate in Streptomyces, but the clones readily undergo double-crossover recombination, thus creating <b>gene</b> <b>replacements.</b> The antibiotic resistance cassettes are flanked by yeast FLIP recombinase target sequences for removal of the antibiotic resistance and oriTRK 2 to generate unmarked, nonpolar mutations. The technique has been used successfully by > 20 researchers to mutate around 100 Streptomyces genes. As an example, we describe its application {{to the discovery of}} a gene involved in the production of geosmin, the ubiquitous odor of soil. The gene, Sco 6073 (cyc 2), codes for a protein with two sesquiterpene synthase domains, only one of which is required for geosmin biosynthesis, probably via a germacra- 1 (10) E, 5 E-dien- 11 -ol intermediate generated by the sesquiterpene synthase from farnesyl pyrophosphate...|$|R

Using reporter gene assays of promoter-luciferase gene-constructs, we show that promoter activity largely depends on an intact Oct and CRE/TRE element within the proximal 145 bp of the promoter. DNase I footprinting revealed binding of proteins to a 40 -bp region covering these two elements. Band shift experiments identified binding proteins as Oct- 1 and factors of the CREB/ATF and AP- 1 family, respectively.

Within the scope of neuroscience applications and for gene therapy, it is now routine to express reporter <b>genes,</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>genes,</b> neuronal activity indicators, and microbial opsins in specific neuronal types in the mouse retina.
