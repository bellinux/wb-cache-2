500|$|The most {{extensive}} {{study of the}} characteristics of altered states of consciousness was made by psychologist Charles Tart in the 1960s and 1970s.

40|$|<b>Interoception</b> {{refers to}} the {{perception}} of the physiological condition of the body, including hunger, temperature, and heart rate. There is a growing appreciation that <b>interoception</b> is integral to higher-order cognition. Indeed, existing research indicates an association between low interoceptive sensitivity and alexithymia (a difficulty identifying oneâ€™s own emotion), underscoring the link between bodily and emotional awareness. Despite this appreciation, the developmental trajectory of <b>interoception</b> across the lifespan remains under-researched, with clear gaps in our understanding. This qualitative review and opinion paper provides a brief overview of <b>interoception,</b> discussing its relevance for developmental psychopathology, and highlighting measurement issues, before surveying the available work on <b>interoception</b> across four stages of development: infancy, childhood, adolescence and late adulthood. Where gaps in the literature addressing the development of <b>interoception</b> exist, we draw upon the association between alexithymia and <b>interoception,</b> using alexithymia as a possible marker of atypical <b>interoception.</b> Evidence indicates that interoceptive ability varies across development, and that this variance correlates with established age-related changes in cognition and with risk periods for the development of psychopathology. We suggest a theory within which atypical <b>interoception</b> underlies the onset of psychopathology and risky behaviour in adolescence, and the decreased socio-emotional competence observed in late adulthoo...|$|E
40|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{physical}} and mental health have been linked to an individualâ€™s ability to perceive the physical condition of their body (â€˜interoceptionâ€™). In addition, numerous studies have demonstrated a role for <b>interoception</b> in higher-order cognitive abilities such as decision-making and emotion processing. The importance of <b>interoception</b> for health and typical cognitive functioning has prompted interest in how <b>interoception</b> varies over the lifespan. However, few studies have investigated <b>interoception</b> into older adulthood, and no studies account for the set of physiological changes that may influence task performance. The present study examined <b>interoception</b> from young to very late adulthood (until 90 years of age) utilising a self-report measure of <b>interoception</b> (Study One) and an objective measure of cardiac <b>interoception</b> (Study Two). Across both studies <b>interoception</b> decreased with age, and changes in interoceptive accuracy were observed which were not explained by accompanying physiological changes. In addition to a direct effect of age on <b>interoception,</b> an indirect effect of ageing on cardiac interoceptive accuracy mediated by body mass index (BMI) was found, such that ageing was associated with increased BMI which was, in turn, associated with reduced interoceptive accuracy. Such findings support and extend previous research demonstrating interoceptive decline with advancing age, and highlight the importance of assessing whether decreasing interoceptive ability is responsible for some aspects of agerelated ill-health and cognitive impairment...|$|E
40|$|<b>Interoception,</b> the {{perception}} of the bodyâ€™s internal state, contributes to numerous aspects of higher-order cognition. Several theories suggest a causal role for atypical <b>interoception</b> in specific psychiatric disorders, including a recent claim that atypical <b>interoception</b> represents a transdiagnostic impairment across disorders characterised by reduced perception of oneâ€™s own emotion (â€˜alexithymiaâ€™). Such theories are supported predominantly by evidence from only one interoceptive domain (cardiac), however evidence of domain-specific interoceptive ability highlights the need to assess <b>interoception</b> in non-cardiac domains. Using novel interoceptive tasks, we demonstrate that individuals high in alexithymic traits show a reduced propensity to utilise interoceptive cues to gauge respiratory output (Experiment 1), and reduced accuracy on tasks of muscular effort (Experiment 2) and taste sensitivity (Experiment 3), unrelated to any co-occurring autism, depression or anxiety. Results suggest that alexithymia reflects a multi-domain, multi-dimensional failure of <b>interoception,</b> which is consistent with theories suggesting that atypical <b>interoception</b> may underpin both symptom commonalities between psychiatric disorders, and heterogeneity within disorders...|$|E
40|$|Disrupted <b>interoception</b> is a {{prominent}} {{feature of the}} diagnostic classification of several psychiatric disorders. However, progress in understanding the interoceptive basis of these disorders has been incremental {{and the application of}} <b>interoception</b> in clinical treatment is currently limited to panic disorder. To examine {{the degree to which the}} scientific community has recognized <b>interoception</b> as a construct of interest, we identified and individually screened all articles published in the English language on <b>interoception</b> and associated root terms in Pubmed, Psychinfo and ISI Web of Knowledge. This search revealed that <b>interoception</b> is a multifaceted process that is being increasingly studied within the fields of psychiatry, psychology, neuroscience and biomedical science. To illustrate the multifaceted nature of <b>interoception</b> we provide a focused review of one of the most commonly studied interoceptive channels, the cardiovascular system, and give a detailed comparison of the most popular methods used to study cardiac <b>interoception.</b> We subsequently review evidence of interoceptive dysfunction in panic disorder, depression, somatic symptom disorders, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa. For each disorder, we suggest how interoceptive predictions constructed by the brain may erroneously bias individuals to express key symptoms and behaviors, and outline questions that are suitable for the development of neuroscience-based mental health interventions. We conclude that <b>interoception</b> represents a viable avenue for clinical and translational research in psychiatry, with a well-established conceptual framework, a neural basis, measurable biomarkers, interdisciplinary appeal, and transdiagnostic targets for understanding and improving mental health outcomes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Interoception</b> can be {{broadly defined}} as the sense of signals {{originating}} within the body. As such, <b>interoception</b> is critical for our sense of embodiment, motivation and well-being. And yet, despite its importance, <b>interoception</b> remains poorly understood within modern science. This paper reviews interdisciplinary perspectives on <b>interoception,</b> {{with the goal of}} presenting a unified perspective from diverse fields such as neuroscience, clinical practice, and contemplative studies. It is hoped that this integrative effort will advance our understanding of how <b>interoception</b> determines well-being, and identify the central challenges to such understanding. To this end, we introduce an expanded taxonomy of interoceptive processes, arguing that many of these processes can be understood through an emerging predictive coding model for mind-body integration. The model, which describes the tension between expected and felt body sensation, parallels contemplative theories, and implicates <b>interoception</b> in a variety of affective and psychosomatic disorders. We conclude that maladaptive construal of bodily sensations may {{lie at the heart of}} many contemporary maladies, and that contemplative practices may attenuate these interpretative biases, restoring a personâ€™s sense of presence and agency in the world...|$|E
40|$|<b>Interoception</b> {{is defined}} as an afferent {{information}} that can be sensed anywhere from within the body. Interoceptive accuracy is an objective measure of detection of interoceptive signals. According to previous studies the differences between humans in experiencing intence emotions lies in their ability to accurately detect interoceptive signals. It seems that temperament and personality could be behind the differences as there is evidence that especially temperament has connection to emotionality and can be connected to neural systems that are also linked to <b>interoception.</b> We hypothesized that temperament {{is more likely to be}} related to <b>interoception</b> than personality and that temperament traits related to negative affectivity and anxiety are related to interoceptive accuracy. This study was part of a project on <b>interoception</b> that began in University of JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤â€™s psychology faculty in the autumn of 2015. There were 37 participants aged between 18 - 35. The interoceptive accuracy was tested with experimental setting including a heartbeat detection task. Participants were asked to attend to their own heartbeat and answer if the delivered audio signal matched their real-time heartbeat or not. 16 series of auditory signals were delivered, each of them containing 10 sounds. Each of the sounds were either synchronized to participantsâ€™ heartbeat or were delivered with a 500 -millisecond delay. Personality and temperament were measured with questionnaires. The data was analyzed statistically with independent sample t-test, Pearson correlation and regression analysis. As we expected, <b>interoception</b> and temperament were connected but <b>interoception</b> and personality were not. The strongest connection was between <b>interoception</b> and factor scale effortful control and especially its subscale attention control. The second important link appeared between <b>interoception</b> and orienting sensitivity and its subscale associative sensitivity. Sadness also appeared to have some kind of connection to <b>interoception</b> and it had an effect on the connection between <b>interoception</b> and the sensitivity traits.

40|$|<b>Interoception</b> {{refers to}} the sensing of the {{internal}} state of oneâ€™s body. <b>Interoception</b> is distinct from the processing of sensory information concerning external (non self) stimuli (e. g. vision, hearing, touch and smell) and is the afferent axis to internal (autonomic and hormonal) physiological control. However, the impact of <b>interoception</b> extends beyond homeostatic/allostatic reflexes: it is proposed to be fundamental to motivation, emotion(affective feelings and behaviours), social cognition and self awareness. This view {{is supported by a}} growing body of experimental evidence that links peripheral physiological states to mental processes. Within this framework, the representation of self is constructed from early development through continuous integrative representation of biological data from the body, to form the basis for those aspects of conscious awareness grounded on the subjective sense of being a unique individual. This theme issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B draws together state-of-the-art knowledge concerning theoretical, experimental and clinical facets of <b>interoception</b> with the emphasis on cognitive and affective neuroscience.
