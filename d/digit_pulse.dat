This practice is called surya anuloma viloma pranayama (SAV). Twelve volunteers (average age 27. 2 years Â± 3. 3 years, four males) were assessed before and after test sessions conducted on two consecutive days. On one day the test session involved practicing SAV pranayama for 45 minutes (SAV session). During the test period of the other day, subjects were asked to breathe normally for 45 minutes (NB session). For half the patients (randomly chosen) the SAV session was on the first day and the NB session on the next day. For the remaining six patients, the order of the two sessions was reversed. After the SAV session (but not after the NB) there was a significant (P <. 05, paired t test) increase in oxygen consumption (17 %) and in systolic blood pressure (mean increase 9. 4 mm Hg) and a significant decrease in <b>digit</b> <b>pulse</b> volume (45. 7 %). The latter two changes are interpreted {{to be the result of}} increased cutaneous vasoconstriction. After both SAV and NB sessions, there was a significant decrease in skin resistance (two factor ANOVA, Tukey test). These findings show that SAV has a sympathetic stimulating effect. This technique and other variations of unilateral forced nostril breathing deserve further study regarding therapeutic merits in a wide range of disorders...|$|E
5000|$|Column splits were relays that {{energized}} during only at 11 and 12-time, allowing <b>digit</b> <b>pulses</b> to {{be separated}} from zone pulses.|$|R
50|$|Each {{input card}} was read at two {{successive}} reading stations. Thus, for example, fields in a card {{could be compared}} with the following card and, should a change be detected, say in invoice number, totals could be printed. Unlike earlier IBM tabulating machines, which had 80 read brushes at each read station, one for each column, the 407 had 960 brushes at each station, one for each possible hole in a punched card. Cards were held in position during each read cycle and the per <b>digit</b> <b>pulses</b> needed were generated using commutators, one for each column. This allowed the card to be read more than once at each station, for greater flexibility.|$|R
25|$|A {{telephone}} exchange automatically senses an off-hook {{condition of the}} telephone when the user removes the handset from the switchhook or cradle. The exchange provides dial tone {{at that time to}} indicate to the user that the exchange is ready to receive dialed <b>digits.</b> The <b>pulses</b> or DTMF tones generated by the telephone are processed and a connection is established to the destination telephone within the same exchange or to another distant exchange.|$|R
50|$|One {{timeslot}} (TS16) {{is often}} reserved for signalling purposes, to control call setup and teardown {{according to one}} of several standard telecommunications protocols. This includes channel-associated signaling (CAS) where a set of bits is used to replicate opening and closing the circuit (as if picking up the telephone receiver and <b>pulsing</b> <b>digits</b> on a rotary phone), or using tone signalling which is passed through on the voice circuits themselves. More recent systems use common-channel signaling (CCS) such Signalling System 7 (SS7) where no timeslot is reserved for signalling purposes, the signalling protocol being transmitted on a different physical channel.|$|R
5000|$|Emitters were sets of 12 exit hubs that {{automatically}} generated a pulse at each specified {{time in the}} card cycle. The twelve exit hubs were wired to contacts on a rotary switch that turned with the card cycle. Thus wiring the 6 exit from an emitter to a punch magnet entry would cause a 6 to be punched at that position. Emitters {{might be used to}} put a numeric constant value, say a date, on every card. Alphanumeric constant data could be created by carefully combining <b>digit</b> and zone <b>pulses.</b> Later machines, such as the 407 also had a complete set of alphanumeric emitters that only required one wire to use.|$|R
5000|$|In most {{countries}} one pulse {{is used for}} the <b>digit</b> 1, two <b>pulses</b> for 2, and so on, with ten <b>pulses</b> for the <b>digit</b> 0; this makes the code unary, excepting the digit 0. Exceptions to this are: Sweden (...) , with one click for 0, two clicks for 1, and so on; and New Zealand with ten clicks for 0, nine clicks for 1, etc. Oslo, the capital city of Norway, used the New Zealand system, {{but the rest of the}} country did not. Systems that used this encoding of the 10 digits in a sequence of up to 10 pulses, are sometimes known as decadic dialing systems.|$|R
50|$|When the {{telephone}} is on-hook, {{the potential of}} the ring conductor of the local loop is held at a nominal level of -48V DC with respect to the tip conductor, provided by {{the telephone}} exchange or a foreign exchange station (FXS) interface. When the terminal initiates use of the line, it causes current to flow by closing the loop, and this signals the exchange to provide dial tone on the line and to expect dial signals, in form of DTMF <b>digits</b> or dial <b>pulses,</b> or a hook flash. When the loop is opened and current stops flowing for a certain period of time, the subscriber equipment signals that it has finished using the line; the telephone exchange resets the line to an idle state. For alerting an incoming call, the exchange rings the telephone by superimposing an alternating current (AC) signal onto the line of between 40 V and 90 V. The frequency of the signal is 20 Hz. In early exchanges, the ringing power was produced by a hand-cranked generator in the operator console of the exchange.|$|R
50|$|The TXE6 consisted, basically, of two parts: a {{unit for}} {{receiving}} <b>digits</b> at 10 <b>pulses</b> per second (p.p.s.), {{followed by a}} two-stage cross-point-switch. The 10 p.p.s. unit was the interface, converting information from dialled pulses, in Strowger form, to fast parallel signal conditions for the reed group-selector registers. The 10 p.p.s. unit was equipped with four controls, and on each there were 96 access circuits, making a total input of 384 junctions. The intermediate switching unit also had four controls, each of which was divided into two parts. Each part controlled a switching unit of 48 inlets and 200 outlets arranged over 10 levels. This gave a total of 1,600 outlets over the ten levels or 160 trunks per level. The outlets were graded over the four controls. A feature of the TXE6 unit was that two equipment levels could be combined to give an availability of 40 trunks from any one level. This facility was used at Leighton Buzzard. The TXE6 went into service {{on the night of}} 18 August 1971 and proved very reliable until withdrawn from service in 1977, when a TXE 4 exchange took over from the TXE 1 and three TXE2 exchanges.|$|R
