40|$|Case StudyThis {{case study}} {{examines}} four different applications where brush seals were {{introduced into the}} gland boxes of process steam turbines where conventional carbon rings and mechanical seals were previously applied. The resulting observations and data are presented to highlight the impacts to <b>gland</b> <b>box</b> reliability, steam losses, and bearing life...|$|E
50|$|Stave {{bearings}} {{have long}} been associated with ships and their propeller shafts. The bearing is suitable for slow speeds and high loads. When used on ships, the bearing is designed to run immersed in water, allowing its use outboard of the stern <b>gland</b> or stuffing <b>box.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{sides of}} the box are {{designed}} to be high enough to safely contain the puppies, yet low enough to allow the mother to enter and leave comfortably, with consideration given to her protruding mammary <b>glands.</b> Alternatively, the <b>box</b> is provisioned with a doorway with adjustable height for the same purpose. The bottom of the box may be lined with specially designed [...] "whelping pads," [...] or layers of newspaper (or fabric) to provide insulation from cold floors and to absorb fluids. Fabric covers or partial covers are often used on top to provide a [...] "den-like" [...] environment for the mother. Full covers may be used to prevent puppies from escaping.|$|R
