40|$|In {{this work}} an {{empirical}} study {{grounded in the}} principles and methods of the comparative variationist framework is conducted to measure the scope of language contact as a factor constraining some potentially <b>diverging</b> <b>uses</b> of a Spanish verbal periphrasis that has undergone a sharp decline {{over the last century}} (haber de plus infinitive). The analysis is based on three independent samples of text that correspond to three dialectal areas of peninsular Spanish (monolingual zones, Catalan-speaking linguistic territories and the north-western linguistic area). These samples, extracted from a corpus made up of texts of communicative immediacy from the 19 th and {{the first half of the}} 20 th centuries, confirm the existence of a certain linguistic convergence in the expressive habits of the speakers in the bilingual communities. In each region, however, the outcomes are different, due to parallel differences in the structural position of the periphrasis in each language. However, a thorough analysis of the variable context that surrounds the periphrasis shows that the observed differences do not affect the essence of the underlying grammar of this variant, whose decline (which favours tener que plus infinitive and becomes faster as the 20 th century advances) is constrained by identical linguistic and extralinguistic conditioning factors in all the dialectal areas...|$|E

Both their place of origin and the group from which they evolved are uncertain. Although the fossil record demonstrating their initial radiation across the Northern Hemisphere is very detailed, the fossil record from the tropics—where primates most likely evolved—is very poor, particularly around the time that primates and other major clades (groups consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants) of eutherian mammals were first appearing.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{probabilistic}} cellular automaton with two absorbing states, {{which can be}} considered a natural extension of the Domany-Kinzel model. Despite its simplicity, it shows a very rich phase diagram, with two second-order and one first-order transition lines that meet at a bicritical point. We study the phase transitions and the critical behavior of the model using mean field approximations, direct numerical simulations and field theory. The second-order critical curves and the kink critical dynamics are found to be in the directed percolation and parity conservation universality classes, respectively. The first order phase transition is put in evidence by examining the hysteresis cycle. We also study the “chaotic” phase, in which two replicas evolving with the same noise <b>diverge,</b> <b>using</b> mean field and numerical techniques.

However, the interaction between horizontal scalability, feature variability and stringent performance and security concerns for these heterogeneous payment applications and stakeholders is not always clear, which creates tension (and sometimes interference) in the successful development of these services. In this work, we identify crucial nonfunctional requirements for payment services and present a simple framework to map these requirements to existing approaches to achieve both horizontal and vertical scalability. We report on experiences with applying a service line engineering (SLE) approach towards payment services that combines cloud computing and SPL to support feature customization in a multi tenant payment service. We conclude with practical experiences and several lessons learned after applying this SPL engineering methodology on our industrial e-payment use case. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} 1940 - 1985 the {{variance}} of average incomes across Mexican states fell by 60 percent. Beginning in 1985, however, and coinciding with the adoption of trade liberalization policies and other market-oriented reforms, state incomes began to <b>diverge.</b> <b>Using</b> microdata from the 1990 and 2000 Mexican Population Censuses, this study decomposes the recent divergence into components due to economy-wide changes in skill prices and components due to state-specific changes {{in the composition of}} workers. The study finds that the rise in the education premium hindered the progress of poor states and raised {{the variance of}} average state wages and labor earnings. However, educational attainment mostly compensated for this income-widening effect. State-level regressions reveal that the initial level of education, size of the agricultural sector, and distance from the U. S. border were important factors, while public infrastructure was not. While the border states clearly benefited from increased trade and opening of the economy, I find no evidence that skill demand or the immigration of highly educated workers particularly favored these states.

However, the question must be asked as to whether decision-makers consider choice modelling to be a policy relevant tool. There may be more cost-effective and convenient means of providing comparable policy guidance than commissioning a choice modelling study. For example, advice on decision options may be sought from experts, such as scientists. However, expert advice may not accurately reflect the value judgements of the public. The aim of this study is to investigate whether public and expert preferences <b>diverge,</b> <b>using</b> the choice modelling technique. Two case studies are utilised – the Ningaloo Marine Park and the proposed Ngari Capes Marine Park in Western Australia. Evidence of both divergence and convergence between public and expert values is found in different instances, with public awareness factors playing a role in this divide.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} research {{looking at}} the design and operation of motorway <b>diverges</b> <b>using</b> the microscopic computer program SISTM. A diverge is {{the area of the}} motorway or other major road where drivers can leave the main carriageway. Low cost measures including the installation of alternative designs (such as the Ghost Island diverge) are assessed which could improve the operation, capacity and driving behaviour at the diverge. Following on from a recent study reviewing the <b>diverging</b> flow-region diagram (<b>used</b> in the UK as a tool to help traffic engineers select the most suitable diverge layout for a particular site with given downstream mainline and diverging flows), it was thought that microscopic models could offer potential benefits in confirming such a choice (particularly in border line situations) as driving behaviour aspects which affect capacity are not catered for in the diagram. SISTM has been used to evaluate existing and alternative diverge layouts in terms of their throughput as well as several other parameters. Modelled and observed data for the speed-flow relationship and the lane distribution of the mainline was compared and differences noted in order that the results could be interpreted correctly. A theoretical comparison of four layouts was carried out; Taper, Parallel, Taper lane drop and Ghost Island diverge. The link between throughput and lane distribution on the mainline before the diverge was also assessed as well as the importance of lane and exit choice. This research presents a summary of some of the key results from the modelling along with a discussion of their accuracy and application. Conclusions and recommendations are made with regard to design implications for diverges along with a list of modelling requirements (essential and desirable) for motorway diverges...|$|R
