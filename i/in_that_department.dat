5|$|He {{appears to}} have taken little {{interest}} in his official duties both as paymaster and inspector-general, leaving affairs {{in the hands of}} Edmund Waters. Waters had been his private secretary, and when Villiers came to office as paymaster, Waters was appointed chief clerk <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>department,</b> rising to deputy paymaster in 1797. Waters and Villiers invested in real estate with some of the money passing through the office; unfortunately for Villiers, Waters was also diverting some of the funds to his own interest in the Opera House, and the accounts of the office were in a shambles.|$|E

In 2009, Stanford was 69th in scoring defense (26.5) and 90th in total defense (403yards per game). A prominent player on Stanford's defense was Owen Marecic, the only person in major league college football that season to play both offense and defense. On defense, Marecic accrued 45 tackles and 2 interceptions as a linebacker; on offense, he gained 117yards and 4 touchdowns as the team's fullback.|$|E

25|$|From {{the second}} year onwards, the {{students}} take courses offered by their departments that are known as depth courses. In addition to these, the students take inter-disciplinary courses known as breadth courses. Separate courses from the {{humanities and social sciences}} (HSS) department, and management and information technology are also required. At {{the end of the third}} year, the BTech and dual degree students undertake industrial training for a minimum period of eight working weeks as part of the undergraduate curriculum. In the final year of their studies, most of the students are offered jobs in industries and other organisations through the Training and Placement section of the institute commonly known as Career Development Centre or CDC. Some students opt out of this facility in favour of higher studies or by applying to recruiting organisations directly. In addition to the major degree as part of the undergraduate education, students can take courses from other departments, and by demonstrating knowledge of a discipline based on objectives set by the department, earn a minor <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>department.</b>|$|E

500|$|GQG {{played a}} key role {{at the start of the}} war. [...] Due to illness Belin had {{delegated}} much of his role to Berthelot, further increasing the power of his influential Third Bureau. [...] The officers <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>department,</b> particularly the recent staff college graduates who were known as the Young Turks, favoured strong offensive action. [...] Having failed to initially perceive the German advance through Belgium, it was these officers who were key in persuading Joffre to attack the exposed German right flank during the Great Retreat from Mons. [...] As a result of the German advances in late 1914 GQG was forced to relocate its headquarters progressively westwards. [...] It moved to Bar-sur-Aube on 31 August, Châtillon-sur-Seine on 6 September, Romilly-sur-Seine on 28 September 1914 and, on 29 November, to Chantilly, within the Paris metropolitan area, where it was to remain for the next few years. [...] This location was suited to GQG operations due to its proximity to the seat of government and the ministries in Paris.|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Spin, Lauren Spencer hailed Badmotorfinger as a [...] "garden of sound" [...] that drew on older hard rock influences without sounding [...] "derivative". Ann Powers from Blender said, [...] "Cornell strikes the perfect Jesus Christ pose on this sonic wallop", while Entertainment Weekly critic Gina Arnold commended Soundgarden for writing more engagingly than their contemporaries, [...] "who seldom get beyond extolling booze, girls, and cars". She concluded in her review that the record was more [...] "stylishly bombastic rather than bludgeoningly bombastic. Tuneless heavy metal is, after all, still tuneless heavy metal, and <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>department,</b> Soundgarden are as functional {{as they make}} 'em." [...] In a retrospective review, AllMusic staff writer Steve Huey deemed the album [...] "heavy, challenging hard rock full of intellectual sensibility and complex band interplay." [...] Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic, finding it [...] "credible" [...] as a metal record because of Thayil's impressive use of guitar noise but less impressive lyrically: [...] "Chris Cornell howls on about 'lookin for the paradigm' and 'your Jesus Christ pose' (I swear, that's the good stuff)".|$|E

[...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide gave the episode a positive review as well, writing [...] "The life of the trucker, as made popular in C. W. McCall's 1976 hit single [...] "Convoy", is brought to life here in all its glory. For once, Homer is in the right and you cannot help but cheer as the truckers spectacularly fail to stop him getting to Atlanta." [...] They concluded by writing [...] "A nice, bonding story for Homer and Bart which is diametrically opposed to the one featuring Marge and Lisa." [...] On the other hand, giving the episode a more mixed review, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote [...] "If nothing else, 'Homerdrive' takes unanticipated paths. The eating contest leads to a long truck drives leads to that 'shocking secret'. All of this means the show manages to become pretty unpredictable." [...] However, he maintained that the episode is only [...] "sporadically" [...] funny, and that it [...] "doesn’t ever excel <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>department</b> – at least not in terms of the trucker story." [...] He enjoyed the episode's B-story more, because of its [...] "absurdity", however he criticized the inclusion of Gil in the episode, calling the character [...] "increasingly overused". Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News gave the episode a mixed review as well, writing that it [...] "may have been a fairly decent episode but for the fact that something similar was done (and done better) on King of the Hill." ...|$|E
