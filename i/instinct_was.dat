When asked about his {{interpretation}} on the character, McCormack commented that his first <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> to make Ted Lewis more alien, sounding like Spock. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011 Scott Henson {{announced}} that Craig Duncan, {{who had worked}} on Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing and the Colin McRae Rally series, was hired as senior studio director. Simon Woodroffe, who had worked at several studios (including Adventure Soft, Midway Games, Ubisoft, and Sega), became the studio's creative director in April 2012. A Rare property, Killer <b>Instinct,</b> <b>was</b> revived in 2013. The company had a supporting role in its development, assisting lead developer Double Helix Games. Another Rare mascot, Conker, was also featured in another Microsoft game, Project Spark as episodic downloadable content. Known as Conker's Big Reunion, it was cancelled in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo's stake {{purchase}} allowed Rare {{to expand}} significantly. The {{number of staff}} members increased from 84 to 250, and Rare moved out from their headquarters at the Manor Farmhouse. Rare also developed a CGI arcade fighting game, Killer Instinct, on their own custom-built arcade machine. Killer <b>Instinct</b> <b>was</b> set to be released for Nintendo's own 64-bit system, the Nintendo 64 in 1995, but was forced to release the game for the 16-bit SNES system, and had to downgrade the game's graphics. Killer Instinct sold 3.2 million copies, and {{was followed by a}} sequel, Killer Instinct 2. Killer Instinct Gold, the console version of Killer Instinct 2, suffered from a graphical downgrade due to the compression technology used to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo 64 cartridge.|$|E

5|$|Pinker's 1994 The Language <b>Instinct</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} of several books to combine {{cognitive}} science with behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology. It introduces the science of language and popularizes Noam Chomsky's theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language – that it needs to be taught, that people's grammar is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that other great apes can learn languages. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much an instinct as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a spider's web-weaving or a beaver's dam-building.|$|E
5|$|The seven-person {{development}} team {{started work}} on the sequel with the ideas that did not fit into the original. They also incorporated feedback from Killer Instinct players. Killer Instinct2 art, design, and programming changed continuously throughout development up until its release. Kevin Bayliss designed the characters and Chris Tilston developed the game engine with feedback from Nintendo's Ken Lobb. Rare used compression technology to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo64 cartridge. While Killer <b>Instinct</b> <b>was</b> planned to showcase the Nintendo 64's power, the console was more limited than Rare's arcade setup, and Rare had to optimize the arcade version to run on the console. The arcade version used an animation to give the illusion of the camera panning horizontally, but the console version used static image files with less detail. Both the arcade and console versions use the same graphic engine and character roster.|$|E
5|$|These events led {{rapidly to}} Mary's defeat and {{imprisonment}} in Loch Leven Castle. The Scottish lords {{forced her to}} abdicate in favour of her son James, who {{had been born in}} June 1566. James was taken to Stirling Castle to be raised as a Protestant. Mary escaped from Loch Leven in 1568 but after another defeat fled across the border into England, where she had once been assured of support from Elizabeth. Elizabeth's first <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> to restore her fellow monarch; but she and her council instead chose to play safe. Rather than risk returning Mary to Scotland with an English army or sending her to France and the Catholic enemies of England, they detained her in England, where she was imprisoned for the next nineteen years.|$|E

25|$|Laurents {{decided to}} develop a story with a similar {{character}} at its center, but was unsure what other elements to add. He recalled a creative writing instructor named Robert E. Short, who felt {{he had a good}} ear for dialogue and had encouraged him to write plays. His first <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> to create a crisis between his leading lady and her college professor, but he decided her passion needed to be politics, not writing. What evolved was a male character who had a way with words but no strong inclination to apply himself to a career using them.|$|E
25|$|Lütjens' first <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> {{to attempt}} to outrun the British ships, {{scrupulously}} obeying his orders. He became even more reluctant to accept battle once the lead enemy vessel was identified as Hood. Even after Hood began to fire on the two ships and {{it became obvious that}} an engagement was inevitable, Lütjens was reluctant to return fire. He ordered his chief yeoman to signal to Prinz Eugen to open fire on the lead enemy ship, but not Bismarck, much to the exasperation of Captain Lindemann, who had the prospect of suffering another disagreement with the Admiral.|$|E
25|$|Basic Instinct is {{the fourth}} studio album by American singer Ciara. It was {{released}} on December 10, 2010, by LaFace Records and Jive Records. Executive-produced by A agent Mark Pitts, Ciara, Tricky Stewart and The-Dream, Basic Instinct returns Ciara to her urban roots with mid-tempo R cuts and bass-heavy pop and dance songs. Aside from production by Stewart and The-Dream, Ciara collaborated with production by Soundz, Infinity and T-Minus. Frequent collaborator and friend Ludacris makes a guest vocal appearance, as does labelmate and fellow Atlanta-native, Usher. After her previous album, Fantasy Ride, suffered numerous leaks and pushbacks, information about Basic <b>Instinct</b> <b>was</b> kept confidential until the first single was released and album was complete.|$|E

500|$|Killer Instinct Gold {{was later}} {{emulated}} in the August 2015 Xbox One compilation of 30Rare titles, Rare Replay. Nintendo Life wrote that Gold graphics had not aged well. The New York Daily News reported that Killer Instinct Gold, while [...] "underrated" [...] in its time, had withered into an outdated frustration as the anthology's biggest letdown. Destructoid singled out Gold as the collection's worst title, {{because it was}} a [...] "barebones" [...] Killer Instinct2. Twenty years after the original release, Retro Gamer wrote that while Killer <b>Instinct</b> <b>was</b> popular in arcades, it had been outdone by Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 2 by 1996, and ultimately proved mediocre in comparison.|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{responses to}} the publication included newspaper sellers refusing to distribute that day's paper. In the following days, the cartoons received significant attention in other Danish press outlets. According to Jytte Klausen, [...] "most people groaned that the newspaper was at it again, bashing Muslims. The <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> to split the blame." [...] Berlingske-Tidende criticised the 'gag', but also said that Islam should be openly criticised. Politiken attacked Rose's account of growing self-censorship; it also surveyed Danish cartoonists and said that self-censorship was not generally perceived as a problem. On October 4, a local teenager telephoned the newspaper offices threatening to kill the cartoonists, but he was arrested after his mother turned him in.|$|E

500|$|As a European-trained {{military}} leader, Montcalm's <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> for large, set-piece {{battles in}} which regiments and soldiers moved in precise order. [...] Such actions required a disciplined soldiery, painstakingly drilled {{for as long}} as 18 months on the parade ground, trained to march in time, change formation at a word, and retain cohesion in the face of bayonet charges and musket volleys. Though his regular regiments (the [...] "troupes de terre" [...] or [...] "metropolitans") were adept at such formal warfare, {{in the course of the}} campaign their ranks had been replenished by less professional militiamen, whose talents at forest warfare emphasised the individual: they tended to fire early and then drop to the ground to reload, thus reducing the effect of concentrated fire at close range.|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, Tricky Stewart, {{confirmed}} via Rap-Up {{that he and}} The-Dream {{had spent}} the entire summer with Ciara working on her upcoming fourth studio album. He also named [...] "Speechless" [...] as one of two songs he hoped would appear on the album. The album version of the song leaked in March 2010, featuring vocals from The-Dream. However, following the release of its single cover on August 18, 2010, {{it was confirmed that}} the song would feature only Ciara. It was also revealed that The-Dream will not be featured on the album version of the song when the official track listing of Basic <b>Instinct</b> <b>was</b> revealed. On the final cut, American songwriter, gospel singer, and session vocalist Lauren Evans performs background vocals. The song was planned to be released as the second official single, how was never sent to radio or released as a CD single.|$|E
500|$|Simon Leng, Harrison's musical biographer, {{describes}} the period {{immediately following the}} tour as [...] "open season on Harrison". Whereas Rolling Stone had declared in 1973 that Harrison had [...] "inherited the most precious Beatle legacy – the spiritual aura that the group accumulated", now the magazine's album reviewer attacked him for his [...] "insufferable" [...] spiritual preoccupations. Writing in the NME, Woffinden similarly dismissed Dark Horse as [...] "the product of a complete egotist ... someone whose universe is confined to himself. And his guru." [...] Privately, Harrison descended into a [...] "spiritual funk", Tillery writes. Another biographer, Joshua Greene, concludes of Harrison's post-tour mindset: [...] "He grappled with the depressing realization that most people simply didn't care to hear about Krishna or maya or getting liberated from birth and death ... A man whose natural <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> to share his life-transforming discoveries with others had been rejected ..." ...|$|E
50|$|Psychologist Abraham Maslow {{argued that}} humans {{no longer have}} {{instincts}} {{because we have the}} ability to override them in certain situations.

For Maslow, an <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> something which cannot be overridden, and therefore while the term may have applied to humans in the past, it no longer does.|$|R

500|$|The {{summer of}} 1918 saw a {{dramatic}} {{decline in the}} fortunes of the government. [...] On 8 July, Clausen, in central Luxembourg City, had been bombed by the British Royal Air Force, killing ten civilians. Although this did not endear the Allies to Luxembourgers, the Grand Duchess' <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> to run to the Germans, who were even less popular amongst the people. [...] On 16 August, German Chancellor Georg von Hertling paid a visit to Luxembourg; although Hertling asked only to see the Grand Duchess, Kauffmann asked that he also attend. [...] To the Luxembourgish people, {{relations between the two countries}} now seemed unambiguously cordial, and all that was left of Kauffmann's credibility disappeared. [...] This was compounded further by the news on 26 August of the engagement of the Grand Duchess' sister, Princess Antonia, to Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, who was Generalfeldmarschall in the German army. [...] Pressure mounted on Kauffmann; with his party still strong, but with his personal reputation shattered, he was left with no option but to resign, which he did on 28 September in favour of Émile Reuter, another conservative.|$|E
500|$|In May 2009, Ciara {{returned}} with her third album, Fantasy Ride. While sticking to her R and hip-hop sound, the album {{had a new}} pop and dance sound, as well as soul influences. Although the album debuted in the top ten of the US, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, it was notably less successful compared to Ciara's previous albums, only selling 193,000 copies in the US in a year. One single from the album, [...] "Love Sex Magic", however, was a worldwide top ten hit. The album also spawned the top ten US R hit [...] "Never Ever". The album's remaining singles, [...] "Like a Surgeon" [...] and [...] "Work", were moderate hits in the US and worldwide, respectively. Also in 2009, Ciara collaborated with Spanish singer Enrique Iglesias on the international top ten hit, [...] "Takin' Back My Love". Ciara's fourth studio album, Basic <b>Instinct,</b> <b>was</b> released on December 10, 2010. It saw the singer returning to her urban roots. The album lead single, [...] "Ride", was a top three hit on the US R chart while the remaining singles, [...] "Gimmie Dat" [...] and [...] "Speechless", were moderate hits on the chart.|$|E
500|$|Other Coward works {{produced}} in the mid-to-late 1920s included the plays Easy Virtue (1926), a drama about a divorcée's clash with her snobbish in-laws; The Queen Was in the Parlour, a Ruritanian romance; This Was a Man (1926), a comedy about adulterous aristocrats; The Marquise (1927), an eighteenth-century costume drama; Home Chat (1927), a comedy about a married woman's fidelity; and the revues On with the Dance (1925) and This Year of Grace (1928). None of these shows has entered the regular repertoire, but the last introduced one of Coward's best-known songs, [...] "A Room with a View". His biggest failure in this period was the play Sirocco (1927), which concerns free love among the wealthy. It starred Ivor Novello, of whom Coward said, [...] "the two most beautiful {{things in the world}} are Ivor's profile and my mind". Theatregoers hated the play, showing violent disapproval at the curtain calls and spitting at Coward as he left the theatre. Coward later said of this flop, [...] "My first <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> to leave England immediately, but this seemed too craven a move, and also too gratifying to my enemies, whose numbers had by then swollen in our minds to practically the entire population of the British Isles." ...|$|E
