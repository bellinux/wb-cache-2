40|$|Several recent {{longitudinal}} studies {{have investigated the}} hormonal correlates of both young adult women's general sexual desire and, more specifically, their desire <b>for</b> uncommitted <b>sexual</b> relationships. Findings across these studies have been mixed, potentially because each study tested only small samples of women (Ns =  43, 33, and 14). Here we report results from a much larger (N =  375) longitudinal study of hormonal correlates of young adult women's general sexual desire and their desire <b>for</b> uncommitted <b>sexual</b> relationships. Our analyses suggest that within-woman changes in general sexual desire are negatively related to progesterone, but {{are not related to}} testosterone or cortisol. We observed some positive relationships for estradiol, but these were generally only significant <b>for</b> solitary <b>sexual</b> desire. By contrast with our results <b>for</b> general <b>sexual</b> desire, analyses showed no evidence that changes in women’s desire <b>for</b> uncommitted <b>sexual</b> relationships are related to their hormonal status. Together, these results suggest that changes in hormonal status contribute to changes in women's general sexual desire, but do not influence women's desire <b>for</b> uncommitted <b>sexual</b> relationships...|$|R

5|$|Shortened {{forms of}} this life cycle are common, for example some oceanic scyphozoans omit the polyp stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. Hydrozoa {{have a variety of}} life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. hydra) have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain {{attached}} to the polyp and are responsible <b>for</b> <b>sexual</b> reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (Turritopsis dohrnii and Laodicea undulata) and Scyphozoa (Aurelia sp.1). Anthozoa have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible <b>for</b> <b>sexual</b> reproduction.|$|E

The risk of catching HIV in the city is reportedly high, and many truck drivers stopping in the city <b>for</b> <b>sexual</b> services pose a major risk of spreading the disease to other parts of the country. The risk of catching malaria in Bangui and pygmy camps is also much higher than in the rest of the country.|$|E
5|$|Adkins grew up {{in poverty}} {{in the midst of}} the Depression, and his spirited, unusual {{lifestyle}} is reflected in his music.

The newfound popularity secured him a cult following, spawned the Norton Records label, and helped usher in the genre known as psychobilly.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{selection}} can {{be classified}} according to the resource being competed <b>for.</b> <b>Sexual</b> selection results from competition for mates. Sexual selection typically proceeds via fecundity selection, sometimes {{at the expense of}} viability. Ecological selection is natural selection via any means other than sexual selection, such as kin selection, competition, and infanticide. Following Darwin, natural selection is sometimes defined as ecological selection, in which case sexual selection is considered a separate mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{reproduction}} is complex, reflecting {{the differences in}} lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms. It is estimated {{that a third of}} all fungi reproduce using more than one method of propagation; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages within the life cycle of a species, the teleomorph and the anamorph. Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the creation of specialized structures <b>for</b> <b>sexual</b> or asexual reproduction. These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-containing propagules.|$|E
