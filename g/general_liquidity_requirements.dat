40|$|AbstractThe <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> and the {{available}} liquidity are aspects that {{are influenced by}} order-independent and order-specific business processes; they represent dynamic parameters over time, {{making it difficult for}} many companies to plan and ensure liquidity. Apart from the complexity of material and financial flows, it is the time gap in the flows of the order fulfillment process which complicates the determination of future <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements.</b> This paper presents a causal model based on cause-and-effect networks, which takes an integrated look on the material and financial flows derived from the value creation process to identify future <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements...</b>|$|R
40|$|A notable {{feature of}} the Japanese economy {{following}} the banking crisis of the late 1990 s is the drastic decline in the velocity of money and the consequent decline in the price level. Based on the inventory model of money demand a la Alvarez, Atkeson, and Edmond (2009), we explore how macroeconomic shocks affect the velocity. Households in the model are subject to a multiple-period cash-in-advance constraint in which {{the portion of the}} payment in cash, which we call the <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirement,</b> varies according to the credit service supply in the economy. Extracting various shocks underlying the velocity variations from 1990 to 2010, we find that an increase in the <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirement</b> is the key driver of the decline in velocity. Particularly important is the channel stemming from householdsf expectations about the future <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirement.</b> During the Japanese banking crisis and the global financial crisis, credit service is disrupted and households expect the disruption to last long. Since they demand additional money for a higher <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirement</b> for current and future transactions, the velocity and the price level decrease, even though the growth rate of money stock then exceeds that of consumption.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a model of}} information-based bank runs where a central bank sets its lender of last resort (LOLR) policy {{in order to maximize}} welfare. To mitigate the risks associated with overinvestment by the banking sector, the central bank sets prudential <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> for the banking sector {{in the form of a}} ratio of liquid assets to deposits. <b>Liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> then provide a buffer against early deposit withdrawals, but they also allow the central bank to manufacture a distribution of costs to LOLR funding with an expected value equal to 0. It is shown that <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements,</b> along with an appropriate LOLR policy, become welfare improving if the banking sector is characterized by high-profit opportunities, low leverage, and a relatively volatile deposit base. Otherwise, forgone productive investment due to liquidity restrictions may result in a disproportional cost to the banking sector relative to the insurance value of LOLR. ...|$|R
40|$|In this Article I {{review the}} {{literature}} on the conceptual and analytical arguments for and against capital adequacy and <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> for banks, in light of historical and recent experiences and evidence. Much research argues for higher capital adequacy requirements given their beneficial effects in terms of better incentives, greater buffers, and improved interventions in weak banks. The analytical case for <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> is less well established, and current academic thinking is little reflected in regulations being adopted or underway. While the financial services industries object to these requirements, most analyses show the direct costs to be relatively low. Overall, there is general agreement that the social benefits of higher capital (and perhaps <b>liquidity)</b> <b>requirements</b> likely exceed the private costs given the many externalities and market failures in banking. It is clear though that stricter and better-designed requirements need to be supported by a range of regulations and other actions {{to have a chance to}} make the global financial system safer and more efficient...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{includes four}} studies broadly {{connected to the}} causes and consequences of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007 - 8 from a political economy perspective. Following the intro-duction, Chapter 2 analyzes the political roots of massive foreign reserves accumulation, which {{has contributed to the}} American credit boom before the financial crisis. The study shows that elections tend to explain why democracies have acquired less foreign reserves than authoritarian regimes. Basel III was a regulatory consequence of the Global Financial Crisis, which is scheduled to impose <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> as a prudential measure for commercial banks. Chapter 3 examines whether these <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> could have an unintended negative effect on monetary stability. Based on a new dataset of reserve and <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements,</b> the results show that inflation is more robust to changes in the velocity of money if reserve and <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> are low. Increases in the velocity of money are associated with higher inflation rates if reserve and <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> are high. The ability of partisan politics to shape economic policies according to ideological goals has been regularly questioned in an era of globalization and austerity. Chapter 4 suggests that government ideology still has a pronounced impact on economic policy-making based on a sample of OECD and new EU member states. Chapter 5 analyzes why major business leaders in France and Germany have publicly supported the euro in the weeks before a bailout program got enacted by the European Council in July 2011. The study shows that direct corporate interest did not appear to matter. Instead, business leaders appeared to be more likely to join the campaign if they were well-connected in business and political networks. The findings suggest that managers disregarded their short-term economic interest to improve their long-term ties with political decision-makers...|$|R
40|$|The {{business}} environment for SMEs has changed {{rapidly in the}} last years. In view of ever shorter and more volatile economic cycles, SMEs need to increase their entrepreneurial expertise. Financial optimization is gaining importance alongside production-related optimization. Being able to determine the required liquidity will become an absolute necessity. In this respect, {{it is essential for}} business management to integrate both production and financial aspects to determine future <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements.</b> The objective of this thesis is to develop a model that enables SMEs to determine their future <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements.</b> The model is based on the causeand- effect dependencies in the operational value creation process including material flow, which, in turn, precedes and triggers the cash flow. First of all, the relevant determinants of the material and financial flows are identified, connecting the value creation process with the procurement and sales market. To enable its application in industry, the causal model is translated into a procedural method. This procedural method consists of four steps which help to determine the future <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> of SMEs. In the first step, products, suppliers and customers are analyzed before examining the value creation process in the second step. Step three includes the analysis of cash flows on the basis of current and future sales orders. The collected data provide the basis for determining the chronology of the financial inflows and outflows of the future production program. Considering the current account and the value of the cash assets, it is possible, in step four, to determine the future <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> based on production orders and planned orders. The procedural model was validated in an engineering SME characterized by small-batch production. The validation showed that the developed model supports SMEs in determining their future <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> at minimum effort. In addition, the model provides the transparency that is needed before actions can be taken...|$|R

40|$|This paper formulates {{a dynamic}} {{model of a}} bank exposed to both credit and {{liquidity}} risk, which can resolve financial distress in three costly forms: fire sales, bond issuance ad equity issuance. We use the model to analyze the impact of capital regulation, <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> and taxation on banks' optimal policies and metrics of efficiency of intermediation and social value. We obtain three main results. First, mild capital requirements increase bank lending, bank efficiency and social value relative to an unregulated bank, but these benefits turn into costs if capital requirements are too stringent. Second, <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> reduce bank lending, efficiency and social value significantly, they nullify the benefits of mild capital requirements, and their private and social costs increase monotonically with their stringency. Third, increases in corporate income and bank liabilities taxes reduce bank lending, bank efficiency and social value, with tax receipts increasing with the former but decreasing with the latter. Moreover, the effects {{of an increase in}} both forms of taxation are dampened if they are jointly implemented with increases in capital and <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements.</b> ...|$|R

There are two informational frictions: agents receive unobservable shocks and {{can participate in}} markets by engaging in trades unobservable to intermediaries.

We identify a simple regulation a <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirement</b> that corrects such an externality by a¤ecting the interest rate on the markets. We characterize {{the form of the}} optimal <b>liquidity</b> adequacy <b>requirement</b> for a general class of preferences. We show that whether markets underprovide or overprovide liquidity, and whether a liquidity cap or a liquidity oor should be used depends {{on the nature of the}} shocks that agents experience. Moreover, we prove that the optimal <b>liquidity</b> adequacy <b>requirement</b> implements a constrained e ¢ cient allocation subject to unobservable types and trades. We provide closed form solutions for the optimal <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirement</b> and welfare gains of imposing such requirements for two important special cases.

Lower levels of aggregate liquidity increase the estimated effects. Short-term borrowing and lending rates only rise during periods of lower market-wide liquidity. Further, banks do not seem able to pass on the increased funding costs in the interbank market to their private sector clients.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the Basel 3 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on the unsecured interbank money market and therefore on the implementation of monetary policy. Combining two unique datasets, we show that banks which are just above/below their short-term regulatory <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirement</b> pay and charge higher interest rates for unsecured interbank loans. The effect is larger for longer maturities and increases after the failure of Lehman Brothers. During a crisis, being close to the minimum <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirement</b> induces banks to decrease lending volumes. Given the high importance of a well-functioning interbank money market, our results suggest that the current design of the LCR is likely to dampen the effectiveness of monetary policy. ...|$|R

40|$|A simple two-period, two-bank {{model of}} an RTGS system with {{collateralised}} intraday credit is presented. It is shown that {{two types of}} outcome are possible - inefficient or efficient - depending on whether banks care about payments imbalances between {{them in the first}} period. If they do, banks delay payments to each other, increasing their aggregate <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements.</b> It is argued that efficiency is not guaranteed even when banks face repeated interaction in a real payment system, largely because of imperfect information and the competitive dynamics of the payment industry. An efficient outcome can be achieved by the imposition of throughput rules on the value of payments banks must make by a certain deadline. These can both reduce aggregate <b>liquidity</b> <b>requirements</b> and increase the contestability of the payments market, encouraging a higher degree of direct access to payment systems. Throughput rules could therefore also have risk-reduction benefits if they help to reduce the level of tiering in the financial system.
