40|$|Introduction. American trypanosomiasis, {{also known}} as Chagas disease, is a {{zoonosis}} caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). Dogs and cats participate actively in this parasite's transmission cycle. This study aimed at evaluating the occurrence of T. cruzi in dogs and cats from Botucatu, SP, Brazil, {{as well as at}} evaluating the technique of <b>hemoculture</b> in LIT (liver infusion tryptose) medium by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Methods. Blood samples were collected from 50 dogs and 50 cats in Botucatu-SP, Brazil. For <b>hemoculture,</b> the samples were inoculated in LIT medium, and readings were performed for four months. Upon completion of such period, all the hemocultures were processed for parasitic DNA extraction. The PCR reactions were performed by using primers TCZ 1 /TCZ 2. Results. Ten dogs and ten cats (20 %) were positive to PCR, and four dogs and three cats (7 %) were positive to <b>hemoculture.</b> Only in a one cat sample (1 %) there was confirmation of positive <b>hemoculture</b> by PCR for T. cruzi. Conclusions. Results showed that PCR was a suitable tool for the confirmation of the parasite detection in <b>hemoculture</b> samples, and that dogs and cats from Botucatu, SP, Brazil, are maintaining the role of household reservoirs of T. cruzi, which reinforces the need for constant epidemiologic surveillance for this zoonosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. During {{the course}} of chronic chagasic infection, low {{parasite}}mia levels prevent parasite detection by current techniques such as <b>hemoculture</b> and xenodiagnosis. Since serologic tests have sensitivity but lack specificity, molecular assays based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been proposed as alternative tools for parasite detection in individuals with chronic Chagas ’ disease. A variable degree of PCR efficiency {{has been reported in}} the literature and illustrates the need for further evaluation of large numbers of chagasic patients. In this study, we compared an optimized PCR technique with <b>hemoculture</b> and complement-mediated lysis (CoML) in 113 individuals from or living in endemic areas of Brazil who had conventional serologic results that were either positive, negative, or inconclusive. The PCR amplification yielded positive results in 83. 5 % (66 of 79) of individuals with positive serology, 47. 6 % (10 of 21) with negative serology, and 46. 2 % (6 of 13) with inconclusive serology. Of 10 patients with negative serology and positive PCR result, eight (80 %) had positive CoML, indicating that they could have been chagasic but were not mounting immune responses. The PCR results were also positive for all individuals who had positive <b>hemoculture,</b> for 37 individuals with negative <b>hemoculture</b> and positive serology, and for two of six individ-uals with inconclusive serology and negative <b>hemoculture.</b> Thirteen individuals living in nonendemic areas who had negative serology were used as a negative control group: 100 % had negative PCR results. Our results show that the optimized PCR protocol used here was very sensitive in detecting the presence of Trypanosoma cruzi in chroni...|$|E
40|$|Uninfected dogs (n = 10) {{and those}} {{naturally}} infected with leishmaniasis (n = 10) {{were subjected to}} several diagnostic tests, namely: <b>hemoculture,</b> polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of <b>hemoculture,</b> indirect immunofluorescence (RIFI), cytological examination of lymph node aspirate, culture of lymph node aspirate and PCR of lymph node aspirate. RIFI - followed by PCR of lymph node aspirate culture - presented more positive results in infected dogs than in uninfected ones. In infected animals, RIFI was more effective than PCR of lymph node aspirate culture. There was no statistical difference in positivity between RIFI and hemoculture; lymph node aspirate culture/cytological examination of lymph node aspirate and PCR of hemoculture; and between PCR of lymph node aspirate culture and PCR of <b>hemoculture.</b> All infected and uninfected animals had positive and negative results {{in at least one}} test.

40|$|Candidiasis {{is defined}} as an {{infection}} or disease caused by a fungus of the genus Candida. Rate of disseminated candidiasis increases {{with the growth of}} the number of immunocompromised patients. In the the last few decades the incidence of disseminated candidiasis is in growth as well as the mortality rate. The aim of this survey is to show the importance of serological tests implemenation in disseminated candidiasis diagnose. This is a prospective study involving 60 patients with malign diseases with and without clinical signs of disseminated candidiasis and 30 healthy people who represent the control group. Apart from <b>hemoculture,</b> detection of circulating mannan antigen and adequate antibodies of Candida species applying comercial ELISA test was determined in each patient. This survey deals with relevant factors causing disseminated candidiasis. This survey showed that the group of patients with clinical signs of disseminated canididiasis had more patients with positive <b>hemoculture</b> to Candida species, then the group of patients without clinical signs of disseminated candidiasis. The number of patients being examined and positive to antigens and antibodies was higher (p< 0. 01) in the group of patients with clinical signs of disseminated candidiasis (7 / 30; 23. 3 %), then in the group of patients without clinical signs of disseminated candidiasis (0 / 30; 0 %). Average value of titra antigen was statistically higher (p< 0. 001) in patients with Candida spp. positive hemocultures rather then in patients with Candida spp. negative hemocultures. In the group of patients with clinical signs of disseminated candidiasis 6 / 30 (20 %) of patients had Candida spp. positive hemocultures while in the group of patients without clinical signs of disseminated candidiasis 1 / 30 (3. 3 %) of patients had Candida spp. positive hemocultures, which was considerably higher (p< 0. 05). Correlation of results of <b>hemoculture</b> and mannan antigens and antibodies in patients with disseminated candidiasis were statistically significant, while correlation of results of <b>hemoculture</b> and antibodies was insignificant. Because of low sensitivity of <b>hemoculture</b> and time needed for isolation of Candida spp., introducing serological tests in regular procedures would speed disseminated candidiasis diagnose...|$|E

40|$|In {{a survey}} {{realized}} on the sylvatic and peridomestic environment at Bambuí county, Minas Gerais State, 44 (37. 9 %) out of 116 opossums (Didelphis albiventris) captured {{were found to}} be naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. One handred and forty three parasite samples were obtanied from 43 infected opossums using simultaneously <b>hemoculture,</b> xenodiagnosis (Triatoma infestans, Panstrongylus megistus and Rhodnius neglectus) and examination of anal glands contents. The parasite samples were characterized according to six isoenzyme patterns. All samples, independently of the method of isolation, presented an isoenzyme pattern similar to the standard T. cruzi Z 1, showing that either xenodiagnosis or <b>hemoculture</b> can used without selecting parasite subpopulation from naturally infected opossums. Preveous isoenzyme patterns reported for human T. cruzi isolates from same region were completely different.

Candida albicans is {{the main cause of}} candidemia and among the non-albicans species C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis are the most frequent agents. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the distribution of Candida species in two tertiary hospitals in Recife, Northeastern Brazil. It began by surveying all positive Candida cultures processed by the microbiology laboratory from September 2003 to September 2006. The cultures, originated from various types of biological material (blood, urine, tracheal, catheter and others), were processed by Vitec ® system (Biomerieux SA, France). A total of 1. 279 (hospital A: 837; hospital B: 442) sample isolates were positive for Candida. The most frequent species in both hospitals were: C. albicans (367), C. tropicalis (363), C. parapsilosis (147), C. glabrata (81), C. krusei (30) and C. guillermondii (14). The isolates were obtained from 746 hospitalized patients.

40|$|Immunity against lethal, {{bloodstream}} {{forms of}} Trypanosoma cruzi was achieved in mice by preinoculation of approximately equal to 10 (5) culture epimastigotes of an attenuated T. cruzi strain (TCC). The risks of TCC inoculation {{in terms of}} pathogenicity or eventual increase in virulence of TCC progeny were evaluated. No pathogenic parasites could be selected from TCC progeny by either mouse, triatome, or culture passages. Immunizing doses of live TCC did not induce in adult mice alterations resembling chronic Chagas' disease, as judged by patterns of mortality, tissue damage, autoantibodies, or parasite recovery. On {{the basis of the}} same criteria, However, a remarkable similarity could be established between the disease caused in mice by inoculation of low numbers (10 (2)) of pathogenic trypomastigotes and human chronic Chagas' disease. Although patent parasitemias were never revealed in fresh blood mounts obtained from TCC-inoculated mice, a few <b>hemocultures</b> and xenodiagnoses gave positive results, particularly soon after inoculations at birth. The parasites recovered by either method remained in the attenuated, epimastigote stage. In rabbits, no local lesions, fever, weight loss, or histopathological alterations were detected after subcutaneous inoculation of 10 (7) TCC organisms, although one fifth of the animals yielded positive <b>hemocultures</b> of epimastigotes. The contrasting host response to cultured epimastigotes as compared with blood trypomastigotes indicates that, in experimental Chagas' disease, immunoprotection is not necessarily associated with immunopathology...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{prolonged}} treatment with iron chelator (desferrioxamine) {{on the development}} of infection in mice inoculated with Y Trypanosoma cruzi were determined. Infected/treated mice presented lower levels of parasitemia and reduced mortality rate compared with infected/non-treated animals. The five out of twenty infected/treated mice that survived the acute phase of infection showed negative <b>hemoculture</b> and positive ELISA in the acute and chronic phases and positive PCR in the acute phase: in the chronic phase, three of the animals presented negative PCR. The single surviving infected/non-treated animal exhibited positive <b>hemoculture,</b> PCR and ELISA in both phases of infection. Infected groups presented lower levels of iron in the liver compared with treated/non-infected or non-treated/ non-infected animals. The serum iron levels of the infected/non-treated group were higher on the 21 st day post-infection in comparison with control and infected/treated groups. These results suggest that decrease of iron in the host leads to T. cruzi infection attenuation...|$|E

During her hospitalisation, the patient's condition worsens on the neurologic and cardiac levels in spite of a wide-spectrum empirical antibiotherapy initiated with the presumed diagnosis of infectious endocarditis. The repetition of cardiac echocardiographies ends up showing a nodule on the mitral valve. The context of neoplasia, negative <b>hemocultures</b> and serologies, lead us to evoke the diagnostic of marantic endocarditis even though this kind of complication was rarely described in cases of cervical neoplasia. An anticoagulant treatment is therefore initiated and the patient's state will progressively improve, at least at first. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{epidemiology}} of Chagas {{disease was}} studied in five rural communities {{located in the}} eastern region of the Panama Province. Serological tests for Trypanosoma cruzi infection revealed a prevalence of 5. 88 % (12 / 204). <b>Hemocultures</b> coupled with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed a Trypanosoma rangeli infection rate of 5. 88 % (12 / 204). An overall trypanosome infection index of 11. 76 % (24 / 204) was detected in this population. A total of 121 triatomine specimens were collected in domestic and peridomestic habitats. Rhodnius pallescens was confirmed as the predominant species. Molecular analysis showed that 17. 8 % (13 / 73) of the examined insects were positive for T. cruzi, 17. 8 % (13 / 73) for T. rangeli, and 35. 6 % (26 / 73) presented mixed infections. Among 73 R. pallescens evaluated, 16. 4 % (12 / 73) contained opossum blood meals. The epidemiological implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
