"That's it," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Nott thoughtfully, plucking at his bushy whiskers {{with his}} fingers and thumb {{as if he were}} removing dead and sapless incumbrances in their growth, [...] "that's just what it is--them's ez in it themselves don't pay, and them ez haz left their goods--the goods don't pay. The feller ez stored them iron sugar kettles in the forehold, after {{trying to get me to}} make another advance on 'em, sez he believes he'll have to sacrifice 'em to me after all, and only begs I'd give him a chance of buying back the half of 'em ten years from now, at double what I advanced him. The chap that left them five hundred cases of hair dye 'tween decks and then skipped out to Sacramento, met me the other day in the street and advised me to use a bottle ez an advertisement, or try it on the starn of the Pontiac for <b>fireproof</b> <b>paint.</b> That foolishness ez all he's good for. And yet thar might be suthin' in the paint, if a feller had nigger luck. Ther's that New York chap ez bought up them damaged boxes of plug terbakker for fifty dollars a thousand, and sold 'em for foundations for that new building in Sansome Street at a thousand clear profit. It's all luck, Rosey." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{numerous}} {{family was}} achieved {{in only two}} years, and succeeded her first child, which was brought from Sacramento at considerable expense by a Mr. William Dodd, also a teamster, on her seventh birthday. This, by {{one of those rare}} inventions known only to a child's vocabulary, she at once called [...] "Misery"--probably a combination of [...] "Missy," [...] as she herself was formerly termed by strangers, and [...] "Missouri," [...] her native State. It was an excessively large doll at first--Mr. Dodd wishing to get the worth of his money--but time, and perhaps an excess of maternal care, remedied the defect, and it lost flesh and certain unemployed parts of its limbs very rapidly. It was further reduced in bulk by falling under the wagon and having the whole train pass over it, but singularly enough its greatest attenuation was in the head and shoulders--the complexion peeling off as a solid layer, followed by the disappearance of distinct strata of its extraordinary composition. This continued until the head and shoulders were much too small for even its reduced frame, and all the devices of childish millinery--a shawl secured with tacks and well hammered in, and a hat which tilted backward and forward and never appeared at the same angle--failed to restore symmetry. Until one dreadful morning, after an imprudent bath, the whole upper structure disappeared, leaving two hideous iron prongs standing erect from the spinal column. Even an imaginative child like Mary could not accept this sort of thing as a head. Later in the day Jack Roper, the blacksmith at the [...] "Crossing," [...] was concerned at the plaintive appearance before his forge of a little girl clad in a bright-blue pinafore of the same color as her eyes, carrying her monstrous offspring in her arms. Jack recognized her and instantly divined the situation. [...] "You haven't," [...] he suggested kindly, [...] "got another head at home--suthin' left over," [...] Mary shook her head sadly; even her prolific maternity was not equal to the creation of children in detail. [...] "Nor anythin' like a head?" [...] he persisted sympathetically. Mary's loving eyes filled with tears. [...] "No, nuffen!" [...] "You couldn't," [...] he continued thoughtfully, [...] "use her the other side up?--we might get a fine pair o' legs outer them irons," [...] he added, touching the two prongs with artistic suggestion. [...] "Now look here"--he was about to tilt the doll over when a small cry of feminine distress and a swift movement of a matronly little arm arrested the evident indiscretion. [...] "I see," [...] he said gravely. [...] "Well, you come here tomorrow, and we'll fix up suthin' to work her." [...] Jack was thoughtful the rest of the day, more than usually impatient with certain stubborn mules to be shod, and even knocked off work an hour earlier to walk to Big Bend and a rival shop. But the next morning when the trustful and anxious mother appeared at the forge she uttered a scream of delight. Jack had neatly joined a hollow iron globe, taken from the newel post of some old iron staircase railing, to the two prongs, and covered it with a coat of red <b>fireproof</b> <b>paint.</b> It was true that its complexion was rather high, that it was inclined to be top-heavy, and {{that in the long run}} the other dolls suffered considerably by enforced association with this unyielding and implacable head and shoulders, but this did not diminish Mary's joy over her restored first-born. Even its utter absence of features was no defect in a family where features were as evanescent as in hers, and the most ordinary student of evolution could see that the [...] "Amplach" [...] ninepins were in legitimate succession to the globular-headed [...] "Misery." [...] For a time I think that Mary even preferred her to the others. Howbeit it was a pretty sight to see her on a summer afternoon sitting upon a wayside stump, her other children dutifully ranged around her, and the hard, unfeeling head of Misery pressed deep down into her loving little heart as she swayed from side to side, crooning her plaintive lullaby. Small wonder that the bees took up the song and droned a slumberous accompaniment, or that high above her head the enormous pines, stirred through their depths by the soft Sierran air--or Heaven knows what--let slip flickering lights and shadows to play over that cast-iron face, until the child, looking down upon it with the quick, transforming power of love, thought that it smiled.|$|E
40|$|The problem: To {{develop a}} paint {{for use on}} {{satellites}} or space vehicles that exhibits high resistance to cracking, peeling, or flaking when subjected {{to a wide range}} of temperatures. Organic coatings will partially meet the required specifications but have the inherent disadvantage of combustibility. Alkali-silicate binders, used in some industrial coatings and adhesives, show evidence of forming a <b>fireproof</b> <b>paint,</b> but the problem of high surface-tension, a characteristic of alkali silicates, has not been resolved. The solution: Use of a suitable non-ionic wetting agent combined with a paint incorporating alkali silicate as the binder...|$|E
50|$|Encasement has {{significant}} benefits {{in almost every}} application, and {{can be applied to}} <b>fireproofing,</b> asbestos-containing <b>paint,</b> plaster, block etc. If the building has a 5-10yr life span remaining, or more, encasement offers major benefits. And for due diligence purposes encased areas should be inspected regularly as one would inspect other building components as part of a regular inspection cycle.|$|R
5000|$|Now after a {{few years}} of {{stagnation}} since 1992, this art has started to continue its briskness having a lot of distinguished artists working in this field. To prepare an enameled dish, the following steps are used.First, choose the suitable dish by the needed size and shape which is usually made by a coppersmith. Then, it is bleached through enameled working which is known as the first coat. It is then put into a seven hundred and fifty degree furnace. At this stage, the enameled metal will be coated with better enamels a few more times and again reheated. The dish is then ready to be painted. The Isfahanian artists, having been inspired by their traditional plans as arabesque, khataii (flowers and birds) and using <b>fireproof</b> <b>paints</b> and special brushes, have made painting of Isfahan monuments such as step, the enameled material is put into the furnace again and heated at five hundred degrees. This causes the enameled painting to be stabilized on the undercoat, creating a special [...] "shining" [...] effect. Most of today's enamel workings are performed on dishes, vases, boxes and frames in various size.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{unprecedented}} Soviet {{requests for}} Western technological aid {{with the development}} of the Tu-144. The request was made despite obviously not helping to foster Soviet technological prestige, {{which was one of the}} key purposes of the Tu-144 programme. In 1977, the USSR approached Lucas Industries, a designer of the engine control system for Concorde, requesting help with the design of the electronic management system of the Tu-144 engines, and also asked BAC-Aérospatiale for assistance in improving the Tu-144 air intakes. (The design of air intakes' variable geometry and their control system was one of the most intricate features of Concorde, contributing to its fuel efficiency. Over half of the wind-tunnel time during Concorde development was spent on the design of air intakes and their control system.) In late 1978, the USSR requested a wide range of Concorde technologies, evidently reflecting the broad spectrum of unresolved Tu-144 technical issues. The list included de-icing equipment for the leading edge of the air intakes, fuel-system pipes and devices to improve durability of these pipes, drain valves for fuel tanks, <b>fireproof</b> <b>paints,</b> navigation and piloting equipment, systems and techniques for acoustical loading of airframe and controls (to test against acoustic fatigue caused by high jet-noise environment), ways to reinforce the airframe to withstand damage, firefighting equipment, including warning devices and lightning protection, emergency power supply, and landing gear spray guards (aka water deflectors or [...] "mud flaps" [...] that increase engine efficiency when taking off from wet airstrips). These requests were denied after the British government vetoed them on the ground that the same technologies, if transferred, could be also employed in Soviet bombers. Soviet approaches were also reported in British mainstream press of the time, such as The Times.|$|R
40|$|Today when {{specific}} shielded {{facilities are}} designed the construction materials and shields should meet {{a range of}} fire safety requirements. A composite coating {{on the basis of}} a water-based fire-resistant paint filled with shungite nanopowder can be applied onto walls, floors, ceilings and other surfaces in the shielded areas to reduce electromagnetic radiation and simultaneously to ensure fire safety. Shungit is a mineral with multilayer carbon fullerene globules which diameter is 10 – 30 nm. Due to the high conductivity shungite is able to weaken electromagnetic radiation. A coating made of schungite-containing paint on a cellulose substrate was subjected to the open flame under the temperature of 1700 ° C for 3 minutes and 40 seconds. That resulted in the formation of insulating foam layer without mechanical damage of the substrate. The XRD diffraction analysis of the powder obtained in the process of flame influence on the coating showed the formation of the such substances as orthoclase, barite, rutile, etc. Carbon contained in shungit and used as a filler for the <b>fireproof</b> <b>paint</b> wasn’t detected. This fact indicates carbon oxidation as the result of its burning out. The shielding efficiency of the composite coating after open flame exposure was measured for the frequency range 8 … 12 GHz with the use of the panoramic attenuation meter and voltage standing wave ratio meter YA 2 R- 67 - 61 with a sweep generator and waveguides. After that the reflection and transmission coefficients were calculated. The results of measurements and calculations showed decrease of the reflection and transmission coefficients due to conductivity decrease and dielectric losses changes of the composite coating provided by silica content increase and carbon percentage decrease...|$|E
50|$|The {{house was}} built in 1868 for Augustus and Laura Blaisdell, natives of New Hampshire who moved here in 1860. The Blaisdells {{operated}} a company that manufactured <b>fireproof</b> roofing and <b>paint</b> at their home base in New Hampshire, and built this building on a prominent site in the village to promote sales, which were conducted from a storefront on its ground floor. The land and building were both owned by Laura Blaisdell, and were willed to Augustus upon her death in 1888. He closed the company store and sold the property in 1891. The building saw a variety of uses, at times exclusively residential, but often with a business component, {{for most of the}} 20th century. The house is architecturally distinctive in the village for its unique combination of Italianate and Greek Revival features.|$|R
2500|$|The {{value of}} the deposit was obvious from the start, but the means of extracting the bitumen was not. The nearest town, Fort McMurray, Alberta, was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and {{transportation}} costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave 600 feet of road in Edmonton, Alberta. Other roads in Alberta were paved with material extracted from oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s Dr. Karl A. Clark of the Alberta Research Council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons built the Bitumount oil separation plant, which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to [...] per day of bitumen using Dr. Clark's method. Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, printers ink, medicines, rust- and acid-proof <b>paints,</b> <b>fireproof</b> roofing, street paving, patent leather, and fence post preservatives. Eventually Fitzsimmons {{ran out of money}} and the plant was taken over by the Alberta government. Today the Bitumount plant is a Provincial Historic Site.|$|R
