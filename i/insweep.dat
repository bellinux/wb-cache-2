25|$|The wave-style breaststroke {{starts in}} a {{streamlined}} position, with shoulders shrugged to decrease drag in the water. While the conventional style is strongest at the outsweep, the wave-style puts {{much emphasis on}} the <b>insweep,</b> thus making the head rise later than in the conventional style. The wave-style pull is a circular motion with the hands accelerating to maximum speed and recovering {{in front of the}} chin, elbows staying at the surface and in front of the shoulders at all times. The high elbows creates the leverage for the powerful torso and abdominal muscles to assist in the stroke. During the <b>insweep,</b> the swimmer accelerates their hands and hollows their back and lifts themself out of the water to breathe. To visualize, some say that the hands anchor themselves in the water while the hips thrust forward.|$|E
25|$|The arm {{movements}} of the front crawl provide most of the forward motion. The arms alternate from side to side, so while one arm is pulling and pushing under the water, the other arm is recovering above the water. The move can be separated into four parts: the downsweep, the <b>insweep,</b> the upsweep, and the recovery. Each complete arm movement {{is referred to as}} a stroke; one stroke with each arm forms a stroke cycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} {{starts in}} the initial position with the body completely straight, body movement is coordinated such that the legs {{are ready for the}} thrust phase while the arms are halfway through the <b>insweep,</b> and the head is out of the water for breathing. In this position the body has also the largest angle to the horizontal. The arms are recovered during the thrust phase of the legs. After the stroke the body is kept in the initial position for some time to utilize the gliding phase. Depending on the distance and fitness the duration of this gliding phase varies. Usually the gliding phase is shorter during sprints than during long distance swimming. The gliding phase is also longer during the underwater stroke after the start and each turn. However, the gliding phase is usually the longest phase in one entire cycle of breaststroke.|$|E
25|$|The {{easiest way}} to breathe during breaststroke is to let the head follow the spine. When the swimmer's elbows have reached the line of his eye and have begun to rise, his head starts to lift. If he uses his high elbows as a hinge for the inward sweep {{of his hands and}} forearms, he will create the {{leverage}} he needs to use his abdominal muscles to bring his hips forward. When his hips move forward, his chest, shoulders and upper back will automatically lift up. Breathing is usually done during the beginning of the <b>insweep</b> phase of the arms, and the swimmer breathes in ideally through the mouth. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose during the recovery and gliding phase. Breaststroke can be swum faster if submerged completely, but FINA requires the head to break the surface once per cycle except for the first cycle after the start and each turn. Thus, competitive swimmers usually make one underwater pull-out, pushing the hands {{all the way to the}} back after the start and each turn.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} {{steps to the}} arm {{movement}}: outsweep, <b>insweep,</b> and recovery. The movement starts with the outsweep.

The hands push back until approximately the vertical plane through the shoulders. At the end of the <b>insweep</b> the hands come together with facing palms in front of the chest and the elbows are at the side at the body. In the recovery phase, the hands are moved forward again into the initial position under water.

2500|$|The leg movement, colloquially {{known as}} the [...] "frog kick" [...] or [...] "whip kick", {{consists}} of two phases: bringing the feet into position for the thrust phase and the <b>insweep</b> phase. From the initial position with the legs stretched out backward, the feet are moved together towards the posterior, while the knees stay together. The knees should not sink too low, as this increases the drag. Then the feet point outward {{in preparation for the}} thrust phase. In the thrust phase, the legs are moved elliptically back to the initial position. During this movement, the knees are kept together. The legs move slower while bringing the legs into position for the thrust phase, and move very fast during the thrust phase. Again, the goal is to produce maximum thrust during the <b>insweep</b> phase, and minimise drag during the recovery phase. In the recovery phase the lower leg and the feet are {{in the wake of the}} upper leg, and the feet are pointed to the rear. In the thrust phase all three parts create their own wake, and the flat end of the feet acts like a hydrofoil aligned to give maximum forward thrust. The resulting drag coefficient (or more precisely the frontal area) is thus doubled in the thrust phase.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the stabilisation of the wrist joint and the ad hoc wrist muscles activations during the two principal phases of the freestyle stroke. Seven male international swimmers performed a maximal semi-tethered power test. A swimming ergometer fixed on the start area of the pool was used to collect maximal power. The electromyography signal (EMG) of the right flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) was recorded with surface electrodes and processed using the integrated EMG (IEMG). Frontal and sagittal video views were digitised frame by frame to determine the wrist angle in the sagittal plane and the principal phases of the stroke (<b>insweep,</b> outsweep). Important stabilisation of the wrist and high antagonist muscle activity were observed during the <b>insweep</b> phase due to the great mechanical constraints. In outsweep, less stabilisation and lower antagonist activities were noted. Factors affecting coactivations in elementary movements, e. g. intensity and instability of the load, accuracy and economy of the movement were confirmed in complex aquatic movement...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to use instantaneous net drag-force profiles to understand front-crawl and backstroke swimming technique. Twenty-nine elite front-crawl and 19 elite backstroke swimmers (FINA point ranking 924. 5 Â± 69. 0) were recruited. From the net drag-force profile the Minimum and Maximum net force occurred during the <b>insweep</b> phase and during the upsweep phase of the front-crawl stroke, respectively. When swimming backstroke the minimum and maximum net drag-forces occurred during the pull phase and push stroke phases, respectively. When turning their head to breath the swimmers increased the net drag-force by 22 %, which could be detrimental to swimming performance. When comparing the variables of swimming speed and the range of force fluctuations participants who exhibited smaller intra-stroke force changes produced faster swimming speeds.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{relationship}} between the intra-cycle variation of the horizontal velocity of displacement of the center of mass (dV), the hand's and feet's velocity, as well as, to identify the variables that most predict the dV's, in butterfly stroke. The study was divided in two parts. The aim of Part I was to investigate the behavior of variables in study at slow swimming velocities and the purpose of Part II was the same but at high swimming velocities. 3 male Portuguese swimmers and 1 female swimmer, of international level were studied in Part I. The swimmers were submitted to an incremental set of 200 m butterfly swims. In the Part II, 7 Portuguese male swimmers of national and international level were studied. Each swimmer performed two maximal 25 m butterfly swims. Both protocols were recorded from four different plans, allowing a 3 D analysis. It was calculated the dV, the 3 D components (Vx, Vy, Vz) of the hand's velocity and the 2 D components (Vx, Vy) of the feet's velocity. Several variables presented significant correlation coefficients with dV at all selected velocities (high velocity ranged from r = 0. 58 for Vx-out to r = 0. 82 for Vy- 1 dwn; slow velocity ranged from r = - 0. 45 for Vx- 1 dwn to r= 0. 73 for Vx-ups; overall velocity ranged from r= 0. 34 for Vz-ent to r = 0. 82 for Vx-ins). It was also computed a regression model to predict dV. For high velocity (up to 1. 75 Â± 0. 09 m. s- 1), the variables that best predict dV were Vy during the first downbeat, Vx and Vy during the arm's <b>insweep</b> (r 2 = 0. 93). At slow velocity (up to 1. 48 m. s- 1), the variables included in the forward step-by-step regression model were Vx during upsweep, Vy and Vx during <b>insweep</b> (r 2 = 0. 69). For overall velocity, the variables that most fit the regression model were Vx during upsweep, Vy during second downbeat and Vz during entry (r 2 = 0. 94). In order to reduce dV, butterfliers should increase hand's velocity in all orthogonal components at the end of the underwater path, should increase the vertical velocity during the downbeats and decrease the velocity during the hand's entry...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we used {{recently}} developed technology {{to determine the}} forceâ€“time profile of elite swimmers, which enabled coaches {{to make informed decisions}} on technique modifications. Eight elite male swimmers with a FINA (Federation Internationale de Natation) rank of 900 Ã¾ completed five passive (streamline tow) and five net force (arms and leg swimming) trials. Three 50 -Hz cameras were used to video each trial and were synchronized to the kinetic data output from a force-platform, upon which a motorized towing device was mounted. Passive and net force trials were completed at the participantâ€™s maximal front crawl swimming velocity. For the constant tow velocity, the net force profile was presented as a forceâ€“time graph, and the limitation of a constant velocity assumption was acknowledged. This allowed minimum and maximum net forces and arm symmetry to be identified. At a mean velocity of 1. 92 +/- 0. 06 m. s - 1, the mean passive drag for the swimmers was 80. 3 +/- 4. 0 N, and the mean net force was 262. 4 +/- 33. 4 N. The mean location in the stroke cycle for minimum and maximum net force production was at 45 % (<b>insweep</b> phase) and 75 % (upsweep phase) of the stroke, respectively. This forceâ€“time profile also identified any stroke asymmetry...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the effect of sculling propulsive arm actions in displacement on the intra-cycle velocity of the hip. Four phases were defined (based on hand movements) prior to the development of the study: inward, pronation, outward and supination. A group of 9 international synchronized swimmers participated in the study. A displacement of 15 m was recorded using a velocimeter and underwater video cameras (bottom and sagittal views). Mean cycle velocity 0. 548 m/s, duration 0. 828 s, sculling frequency 1. 220 sculling length 0, 455 m and percentage of phase duration: inward (38. 6 %), pronation (10. 3 %), outward (33. 5 %) and supination (17. 6 %) were obtained. The mean body velocities were similar in the phases, while the durations where significantly different. The sculling propulsive action helps body displacement in the inward, outward and supination phases; while the pronation had a reduced contribution. Reversal stroke actions help to support the hand fixed it the water while the arm muscles are contracted helping the next propulsive phases (inward or outward) to move the hand an body forward. KEY WORDS: unsteady propulsion, kinematics, velocimetry, vortex recapture INTRODUCTION: Swimming stroke propulsion is composed of different hand and forearm propulsive actions that were classified as: outsweep, downsweep, <b>insweep</b> and upsweep (Costill, Maglischo, & Richardson, 1992). These propulsive actions can be studied from an steady or quasi-steady approach (Schleihauf, 1979) or considering unsteady propulsiv...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the effects of breathing on the three - dimensional underwater stroke kinematics of front crawl swimming. Ten female competitive freestyle swimmers participated in the study. Each subject swam a number of front crawl trials of 25 m at a constant speed under breathing and breath-holding conditions. The underwater motion of each subject's right arm was filmed using two S-VHS cameras, operating at 60 Hz, which were positioned behind two underwater viewing windows. The spatial coordinates of selected points were calculated using the DLT procedure with 30 control points and after the digital filtering of the raw data with a cut-off frequency of 6 Hz, the hand's linear displacements and velocities were calculated. The results revealed that breathing caused significantly increases in the stroke duration (t 9 = 2. 764; p < 0. 05), the backward hand displacement relative to the water (t 9 = 2. 471; p< 0. 05) and the lateral displacement of the hand in the X - axis during the downsweep (t 9 = 2. 638; p < 0. 05). On the contrary, the peak backward hand velocity during the <b>insweep</b> (t 9 = 2. 368; p < 0. 05) and the displacement of the hand during the push phase (t 9 = - 2. 297; p < 0. 05) were greatly reduced when breathing was involved. From the above, it was concluded that breathing action in front crawl swimming caused significant modifications in both the basic stroke parameters and the overall motor pattern were, possibly due to body roll during breathin...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to quantify the instantaneous net drag force profiles of elite front-crawl and backstroke swimmers. From these profiles the inter-stroke coordination, stroke symmetry and the influence of the breathing action on stroke kinetics was quantified. In study 1, an Assisted Towing Device developed in the Netherlands was compared to the earlier Measurement of Active Drag system. Nine intermediate club level swimmers, were tested randomly on both systems and significant differences (p = 0. 002) of 55 % in active drag were found, when swimming at the same maximum speed (mean 1. 68 m. s- 1, 1. 40 - 1. 87 m. s- 1). These differences were attributed to variations in swimming styles when using the two measurement systems. The Measurement of Active Drag system was unable to measure the swimmerâ€™s early catch phase and kick, due to the fixed length and depth of the systems push-off pads. This restricted hand placement then naturally generated a different swimming technique, when compared to the more natural free swimming style associated with the Assisted Towing Method protocol. The more natural, self-selected, arm stroke length, plus the ability to kick; and a data output of an instantaneous force-time profile, resulted in this method being the preferred testing protocol. Twenty-nine elite front-crawl and 19 elite backstroke swimmers (FINA point ranking 924. 5 Â± 69. 0), were recruited to complete six studies to quantify factors that influence the magnitude of the intra-stroke fluctuations. These studies examined; breathing, gender differences, inter-stroke coordination and symmetry variations. This was achieved through an Assisted Towing Method which was designed and developed at the Australian Institute of Sport. The magnitude and location of the minimum and maximum net drag forces and arm symmetry were identified in Study 1. The mean location in the stroke phases where minimum and maximum net drag forces occurred were at 45 % (<b>insweep</b> phase) and 75 % (upsweep phase) of the front-crawl stroke, respectively. Most participants adopted an asymmetrical stroke. This study showed the advantages of representing data as an instantaneous net drag force profile, because it enabled identification of intra-stroke variations within and between individuals.
