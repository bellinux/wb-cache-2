40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to find the optimal conditions for voltammetric determination of pesticides cypermethrin, deltamethrin and <b>difenzoquat</b> on meniscus modified silver solid amalgam electrode using differential pulse voltammetry. Conditions under which cypermethrin and deltamethrin could be determinated were found in previously published works. These conditions were reproduced. Substances were studied in methanol and dimethylformamide solutions. The optimal conditions for determination of these two substances were not found. Voltammetric behaviour of <b>difenzoquat</b> was studied in different pH using Britton-Robinson buffer. The optimal pH 11 was chosen. The reproducibility of measurement was studied at concentration 1 · 10 - 4 mol·l- 1, peak was stable (RSD = 3 %). Sharp maxima were found at high concentrations of analyte, addition of gelatine led to one well- defined peak. Peak potencial was - 1, 4 V. Calibration dependences were measured at concentrations 2 · 10 - 7 mol·l- 1 - 1 · 10 - 4 mol·l- 1. Limit of determination was 6, 1 · 10 - 7 mol·l- 1. Linear dynamic range of this method was found between concentrations 6, 1 · 10 - 7 - 2 · 10 - 5 mol·l- 1. <b>Difenzoquat</b> was determined in model samples of drinking and river water. Limits of detemination were achieved at concentrations 3, 4 · 10 - 7 mol·l- 1 in drinking water and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Eight postemergence {{herbicides}} {{were evaluated}} {{to determine their}} influence on the incidence and severity of take-all disease caused by the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici in winter wheat. Mecoprop ((+) - 2 -(4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxy) propanoic acid), <b>difenzoquat</b> (1, 2 - dimethyl- 3, 5 - diphenyl - 1 H- pyrazolium), dinoseb amine (amine salt of 2 -(1 -methylpropy 1) - 4, 6 -dinitrophenol), and diclofopmethyl (methyl ester of (+) - 2 -[4 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) phenoxy]propanoic acid) sometimes reduced the severity of take-all disease on the seminal and crown roots. The herbicides also reduced the incidence of 'whiteheads' associated with take-all injury. In additional evaluations, mecoprop, <b>difenzoquat,</b> and dinoseb did not affect severity of disease on the roots, but whiteheads again were reduced. Diclofop-methyl applied at 1. 12 kg ai/ha in early January often reduced the severity of take-all disease on seminal and crown roots. Higher rates of this herbicide, however, occasionally increased disease severity. The number of seminal roots produced by plants treated with diclofop-methyl often depended upon both application rate {{and the level of}} take-all stress. Crown root and tiller production were stimulated by diclofop-methyl. Low rates of <b>difenzoquat,</b> dinoseb, and mecoprop often increased tillering as well. The responses of the wheat plant to all four herbicides generally were greatest in plots with take-all disease. Fresh weights of individual tillers generally were reduced in response to herbicide application. Stimulations of tillering in diseased plots treated with diclofop-methyl progressively declined when applications were delayed after early January. Grain yields were greater in diseased plots treated with mecoprop, <b>difenzoquat,</b> and dinoseb than in the untreated check in 1982. Grain yield was either reduced or unaffected by diclofopmethyl, regardless of the level of take-all disease present. Herbicides did not affect grain yield in 1983. In vitro growth of three isolates of Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici was not inhibited by diclofop-methyl at concentrations below 10,uM. Data suggest that herbicides reduced take-all disease by altering wheat growth, allowing diseased plants to compensate for take-all injury. Susceptibility of root tissues to infection also may have been reduced in some cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} wild oats (Avena Jatua L.) in Alaskan spring-planted barley was {{investigated}} {{in a series of}} experiments conducted from 1981 - 1984. Rates and times of applications of triallate (a preemergence, soil-incorporated herbicide), diclofop, barban, and <b>difenzoquat</b> (postemergence herbicides) were investigated in relation to control of wild oats and barley yield in 1981 - 1982. Because of very high wild oats populations. none of the herbicides controlled wild oats to the point of· allowing a barley harvest. [...] Generally, wild oats were best controlled when herbicides were applied at an early growth stage and at the highest application rates. Control of wild oats with triallate was the same whether incorporated using parallel or perpendicular passes of a spike-tooth harrow. In 1983 - 84 both single herbicide treatments and combinations of herbicides were studied. Barban, diclofop, and <b>difenzoquat</b> were applied alone or with triallate applied in the fall or spring in emulsifiable concentrate or granular formulation. Wild oats population levels were lower in these 2 years, and applications of even single herbicides provided good wild oats control. [...] Of the individual herbicides, diclofop provided the best control of wild oats. In general, when triallate was applied in conjunction with diclofop, barban, or <b>difenzoquat,</b> control of wild oats was better and higher barley yields were obtained than when a single wild oats herbicide was applied. When triallate was applied in the fall, the granular formulation provided better control of wild oats than the emulsifiable formulation. In a study of the response of eight barley varieties ('Eero', 'Paavo', 'Galt', 'Otra', 'Otal', 'Datal', 'Udal', 'Weal') to high rates and late times of application of the four herbicides, none of the varieties were differentially susceptible. Diclofop decreased heights of all varieties and decreased test weights...|$|E

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} during 1984 - 85 season at two experimental sites near Riyadh {{to evaluate the}} efficiency of some post-emergence herbicides in the control of weeds in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The experimental sites were of loamy sand soil and were under sprinkler irrigation. The herbicides included bentazon, bromoxynil, chlortoluron, 2, 4 -D, dichlorprop, diclofop-methyl, <b>difenzoquat,</b> isop-roturon, MCP A, metoxuron, terbutryn {{and some of their}} combinations. The bromoxynil-contained treatments (Brominal plus, Buctril M, Pardner and Brominal, each at 2. 5 l/ha) were effective in controlling broad-leaved weeds, improved wheat growth and yield besides being safe and selective. Bentazonldichlorprop (Basagran DP, at 1. 51 /ha) was almost similar in many aspects to those contained bromoxynil, but did not appreciably improve the wheat biological or grain yield. Dic-lofop- methyl (IlIoxane) and <b>difenzoquat</b> (Avenge) each at 4. 0 1 /ha, showed effective control for grasses, and insignificantly improved the wheat growth and yield. Slight symptoms of crop phytotoxicity appeared after their application, but rapidly recovered. 2, 4 -DIMCP A (U- 46 fluid Combi, at 1. 0 l/ha) showed good control of broad-leaved weeds with slight symptoms of crop phytotoxicity and did not improve the wheat growth or yield. Isoproturon (Graminon, at 5 kg/ha), metoxuron (Dosanex, at 4. 0 kg/ha), chlortoluron/ MCPA (Dicuran MA 60, at 2. 5 kg/ha), chlortoluron (Dicuran, at 2. 5 kg/ha) and terbutryn (Igran, at 2. 5 kg/ha) showed excellent control of weeds, accompanied by severe symptoms of crop phytotoxicity, that adversely affected wheat growth and yield...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe use of collision-induced dissociation, postsource decay (CID-PSD) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass {{spectrometry}} {{for the analysis}} of small organic molecules is demonstrated. Three pesticides: paraquat, diquat, and <b>difenzoquat</b> were chosen for this study. The matrices 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), α-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid (α-CHCA), and sinapinic acid (SA) were selected to investigate the effect of the matrix on the CID-PSD MALDI spectra of these molecules. α-CHCA and DHB were found to be appropriate matrices for the pesticides studied. Spectra for a given pesticide obtained from different matrices were compared with each other, and the differences between them are discussed. A comparison of CID-PSD MALDI with fast-atom bombardment MS/MS spectra is presented; the agreement of pesticide fragmentation patterns between the two methods indicates that CID-PSD MALDI MS is a reliable and efficient technique for structural elucidation of small molecules...|$|E
40|$|Sixteen {{spring wheat}} cultivars {{were tested in}} {{southern}} New South Wales for their tolerances to the recommended rates, and three times the recommended rates, and three times the recommended rates of barban, diclofop-methyl, <b>difenzoquat</b> and flamprop-methyl in 1978 and 1979. Differences between cultivars in their tolerances to barban and diclofop-methyl were identified in the grain yield responses to three times the recommended rates of these herbicides. Crop damage was more severe in 1978 than 1979. Olympic, Shortim, Teal and Warimba were consistently susceptible to barban, while Condor, Cook, Egret and Oxley were more tolerant than the other cultivars. The differences between cultivars treated with diclofop-methyl were smaller and variable. However, Lance, Teal and Tincurrin were the most sensitive whilst Cook, Kewell and Oxley showed the greatest tolerance. Visual assessments of crop damage did not accurately reflect crop tolerance, therefore grain yield {{should be used to}} identify susceptible cultivars...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexation}} of {{the highly}} fluorescent 6 -methoxy- 1 -methyl-quinolinium (C 1 MQ) and the widely used herbicide, <b>difenzoquat</b> (DFQ), with 4 -sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SCX 4) macrocycle was studied by isothermal titration calorimetry, fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy in aqueous solutions at 298 K. Both guests produced 1 : 1 complexes with SCX 4, but the binding affinity of C 1 MQ {{was more than one}} order of magnitude larger than that of DFQ in neutral medium. The higher stability of C 1 MQSCX 4 complex originated from the significant enthalpy gain upon its formation. The encapsulation of C 1 MQ in SCX 4 in the ground state resulted in an efficient fluorescence quenching due to electron transfer from the host to the excited guest. The marked difference in the fluorescence quantum yields for free and bound C 1 MQ was used to detect the competitive complexation of DFQ in SCX 4...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{cationic}} copper (Cu 2 +) on the sorption of anionic metsulfuron-methyl (Me) and cationic <b>difenzoquat</b> (DZ) to peat and soil was studied using a batch equilibration method. The {{results showed that}} Cu 2 + increased the sorption of Me but diminished the sorption of DZ. The adsorption of Cu 2 + {{on the surface of}} peat and soil neutralizes the negative charge, making the zeta potential (zeta) of peat and soil less negative, consequently decreasing the repulsion between the surface of peat or soil and Me and increasing the sorption of Me. Cu 2 + may additionally form Cu-Me complexes in aqueous solution, which was preferentially sorbed to peat and soil over the anionic Me. In contrast, the decreased negative surface charge of soil and peat does not favor the sorption of cationic DZ. Fourier transform infrared showed that DZ may be sorbed through interaction with -OH or -COOH groups of peat and soil and that surface complexes of Cu 2 + may form through these groups. A competitive sorption between Cu 2 + and DZ for the same sorption sites is indicated, leading to mutual sorption inhibition of both cations...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{use of the}} preemergence her-bicide triallate {{over the}} last three decades has {{selected}} for resistant (R) Avena fatua L. populations in several areas of the Unit-ed States and Canada. R plants are also cross-resistant to the unrelated pyrazolium herbicide <b>difenzoquat.</b> We made recipro-cal crosses between inbred R and sus-ceptible (S) lines to determine the genetic basis of triallate resistance. Seeds from parental lines and F 2 populations were treated with soil applications of 0. 275, 0. 55, or 1. 1 kg/ha triallate in the green-house and plant heights recorded after 37 days. Surviving F 2 plants were selfed and the resulting F 3 families were screened with 1. 1 kg/ha triallate. In the F 2 popula-tions, assortment of S and R phenotypes fit a 15 : 1 segregation ratio, suggesting that resistance was controlled by the two independently segregating recessive genes TRR 1 and TRR 2. None of the 912 F 3 progeny from 51 R F 2 individuals was susceptible to triallate treatment, further supporting a two-gene mode of inheri-tance. There was a possible maternal ef-fect on susceptibility at the highest triallate rate tested. Widespread use of herbicides has selected for resistant (R) populations of more than 200 weed species in many agronomic and noncrop situations (Heap 2001). Triallate, a thiocarbamate herbicide used for Avena fatua (wild oat) control, has been used successfully in small grain production fields for more than 25 years. However, A. fatua populations not controlled by field rates of triallate were first documented in 1990 in Alberta (O’Donovan et al. 1994) and have since been confirmed in Mon...|$|E
40|$|The mixed-mode (C 18 /strong cation exchange-SCX) {{solid-phase}} microextraction (SPME) fiber {{has recently}} {{been shown to have}} increased sensitivity for ionic compounds compared to more conventional sampler coatings such as polyacrylate and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). However, data for structurally diverse compounds to this (prototype) sampler coating are too limited to define its structural limitations. We determined C 18 /SCX fiber partitioning coefficients of nineteen cationic structures without hydrogen bonding capacity besides the charged group, stretching over a wide hydrophobicity range (including amphetamine, amitriptyline, promazine, chlorpromazine, triflupromazine, <b>difenzoquat),</b> and eight basic pharmaceutical and illicit drugs (pKa> 8. 86) with additional hydrogen bonding moieties (MDMA, atenolol, alprenolol, metoprolol, morphine, nicotine, tramadol, verapamil). In addition, sorption data for three neutral benzodiazepines (diazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam) and the anionic NSAID diclofenac were collected to determine the efficiency to sample non-basic drugs. All tested compounds showed nonlinear isotherms above 1 mmol/L coating, and linear isotherms below 1 mmol/L. The affinity for C 18 /SCX-SPME for tested organic cations without Hbond capacities increased with longer alkyl chains, ranging from logarithmic fiber-water distribution coefficients (log Dfw) of 1. 8 (benzylamine) to 5. 8 (triflupromazine). Amines smaller than benzylamine may thus have limited detection levels, while cationic surfactants with alkyl chain lengths > 12 carbon atoms may sorb too strong to the C 18 /SCX sampler which hampers calibration of the fiber-water relationship in the linear range. The log Dfw for these simple cation structures closely correlates with the octanol-water partition coefficient of the neutral form (Kow,N), and decreases with increased branching and presence of multiple aromatic rings. Oxygen moieties in organic cations decreased the affinity for C 18 /SCX-SPME. Log Dfw values of neutral benzodiazepines were an order of magnitude higher than their log Kow,N. Results for anionic diclofenac species (logKow,N 4. 5, pKa 4. 0, log Dfw 2. 9) indicate that the C 18 -SCX fiber might also be useful for sampling of organic anions. This data supports our theory that C 18 -based coatings are able to sorb ionized compounds through adsorption and demonstrates the applicability of C 18 -based SPME in the measurement of freely dissolved concentrations {{of a wide range of}} ionizable compounds...|$|E
