In this paper, the {{influence}} of the types and addition dose of MgO <b>expanding</b> <b>agent</b> and the age of cement on expansion value and expansion performance of cement based material added with MgO <b>expanding</b> <b>agent</b> was systematically studied. The expansion characteristics of cement based material added with MgO <b>expanding</b> <b>agent</b> or calcium sulphoaluminate <b>expanding</b> <b>agent</b> were compared. The expansion of such material increases with the addition dose of MgO <b>expanding</b> <b>agent</b> and cement mortar age. During the test period, the expansion of cement based material increases continuously. The light-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> <b>agent</b> modified by CaO <b>expanding</b> <b>agent</b> is able to increase the 28 d expansion of such material effectively. The temperature of calcination for the heavy-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> <b>agent</b> is higher than that of light-burned one, thus the heavy-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> <b>agent</b> has a rather dense structure with slow hydration rate and gives a small expansion of the cement based material at early age, showing an obvious expansion delay. The calcium sulphoaluminate <b>expanding</b> <b>agent</b> gives most expansion of the material in the early 28 d and there is small expansion at middle and later age of the material...|$|E

In addition, a testing facility has been designed and conducted to measure the circumferential strain during the solidification process. The calculation results are in good agreement with experimental data. The results show that the chemical solidification stress of concrete filled steel tube is not only related to the geometrical size of the structure and expanding rate of the concrete, but also related to the time history of expansion process.

In this study, we give a description of the coalescence mechanism of insonified microbubbles, based on high-speed photography and theoretical modeling. Our experimental setup for photographing insonified contrast bubbles consisted of a 500 kHz single-element transducer mounted into a water-filled container, spherically focused at the focal plane of the optical system. The optical images were recorded through a microscope with a fast framing camera capturing 8 frames at a frame rate of 3 million frames per second. Contrast agent microbubbles with monolayer lipid shells were insonified by 10 cycles of 0. 5 MHz ultrasound with high acoustic amplitudes, in the range 0. 66 – 0. 85 MPa.

Flattening of the opposing bubble surfaces occurs if and only if the bubble system has a Weber number greater than 0. 5.
