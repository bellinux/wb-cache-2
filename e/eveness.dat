40|$|Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) is an {{economically}} important plant, widely cultivated {{not only for}} its delicious shoots and versatile culms, but also as an important biomass resource in southern China. However, with its robust growth and strong rhizomes, it has recently been shown to be a problem tree, capable of dominating some forest stands. Indeed, it may displace species within the community it invades with considerable potential impacts. However, {{little is known about the}} consequences of its invasion on plant community composition. We compared plant biodiversity change in different communities where we monitored and removed bamboo over a seven years period (2005 to 2011) in Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve, so as to elucidate the impacts of Moso bamboo invasion. The results showed that Moso bamboo invasion had negative effects on plant communities. Simpson’s Diversity Index in tree and shrub layers of bamboo forest was lower than that of forests consisting of needle and broad-leaved species, and also those containing a mixture of bamboo with needle and broad-leaved plants. However, Simpson’s Diversity Index in the herb layer of bamboo forest was higher than that in the two other forest types. Plant species richness, Simpson’s Diversity Index, and Pielou’s <b>Eveness</b> Index varied greatly among the different forest types over time. In the tree and shrub layers of forests containing bamboo growing with both needle and broad-leaved species, these three indices declined significantly over the monitoring period (P 0. 05). Plant species richness increased in the herb layer of forests containing bamboo mixed with needle and broad-leaved species, while Simpson’s Diversity Index and Pielou’s <b>Eveness</b> Index did not change greatly over time. The removal of Moso bamboo resulted in an increase in plant species richness and Simpson’s Diversity Index in the tree and shrub layers. In contrast, plant species richness, Simpson’s Diversity Index, and Pielou’s <b>Eveness</b> Index decreased significantly in the herb layer. In summary, in the Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve, Moso bamboo invasion was found to cause substantial changes in plant species diversity and had strong negative effects on plant communities. These results suggest that, in addition to scientific management, removal of Moso bamboo may be required to restore plant species diversity in these communities...|$|E

Infracommunities in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks {{were characterized by}} low diversity and high <b>eveness,</b> and generally consisted of less than 100 helminths per duck. Similarity values (mean percent similarity and mean Jaccard's coefficients) were low. In contrast, infracommunities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers were more diverse, displayed low <b>eveness</b> values and consisted of far greater numbers of helminths. Mean similarity values for the infracommunities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers were much higher than those in yellow-billed or red-billed ducks. The component communities in all four duck hosts were species rich. Those in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks, however, consisted predominantly of satellite species and no core species were present, whereas those in Cape teal and Cape shoveller included several core species. Cape teal and Cape shovellers each had a group of recurrent species but {{there was not much}} of a tendency for species to co-occur in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks. Multivariate analysis revealed a greater similarity between the communities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers than between the latter and the communities in yellow- billed or red-billed ducks. Communities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers could be distinguished from each other by {{the presence or absence of}} particular cestode species. The communities in these two species could be distinguished from those in yellow-billed or red-billed ducks by a suite of cestode species that was absent in the latter two.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{stratigraphy}} {{of the newly}} defined mid-Carboniferous boundary. The selection of the mid-Carboniferous stratotype section should reconcile problems between the different mid-Carboniferous biostratigraphies developed throughout the world and provide a standard against which other successions can be correlated. The nature of the mid-Carboniferous boundary in the Clare Basin has been investigated. Various geochemical analyses have been conducted on a mid-Carboniferous section {{and it has been}} possible to construct a chart relating these various geochemical parameters to relative sea-level. It is shown that although deposition is complete through the interval, there is a geochemical expression of a lowstand during the lowest Chokierian. Additionally, doubt is cast on the presumption that all sediments deposited outside 'marine bands' are non marine. A model has been developed for mid-Carboniferous deposition in the Clare Basin. It is envisaged that the shelves of the Clare Basin were flooded during the early Namurian leading to an environment suitable for phosphate authigenesis. During a major regression in the Pendleian/lower Arnsbergian the phosphate was reworked into a lag. The lowstand of the basal Chokierian is marked by a thin lag on the shelves, whilst deposition was continuous in the basin centre. Later Chokierian times are marked by a widespread transgression. The mid-Carboniferous stratotype has been chosen at Arrow Canyon,Nevada. Microfacies studies show that deposition was on a winnowed carbonate platform showing reworking of bioclasts. Faunal diversity and <b>eveness</b> studies have also been conducted on this section. No drop in diversity is seen at the mid-Carboniferous boundary, although a drop in <b>eveness</b> is seen, whether this relates to a specialised fauna or selective winnowing of bioclasts is unknown. Correlations between America and western Europe show that conodonts are strongly facies controlled and {{it is unlikely that the}} appearance of Declinognathodus noduliferus is truly isochronous between sections, and thus is an unwise choice for defining the mid-Carboniferous boundary. Additionally it is suggested that Arrow Canyon was a poor choice for the stratotype section due to both the possibility of reworking, the presence of an unconformity in the section and possible doubts over the conodont record at this locale. The Rhachistognathus minutus zone is recognized as a new conodont zone across the Arnsbergian/Chokierian boundary...|$|E

Between May of 2003 and April of 2004 {{the temporal}} changes were monitored {{in the structure of}} the demersal ichthyofauna of the Bay of Pinheiros (Paraná), through three bottom trawls accomplished monthly in each one of the four areas between the access bar and the most internal areas. In the 144 accomplished trawls 58 species belonging to 25 families were collected, totaling 18154 fishes. The families that presented larger wealth of species were Sciaenidae (15 species), Ariidae (5), Tetraodontidae (4), Engraulidae (4), Carangidae (4), Paralichthyidae (3) and Haemulidae (3). The species Stellifer rastrifer, Cathorops spixii, Chirocentrodon bleekerianus, Cynoscion leiarchus, Stellifer brasiliensis, Achirus lineatus and Micropogonias furnieri dominated in number of individuals, representing 91, 4 % of the total capture. Significantly, there was larger capture of number of fishes in April. Between the indexes of diversity of Shannon-Wiener and <b>eveness</b> of Pielou differences were not observed. Through the grouping analyses and ordination of the dominant species two groups were formed in the level of 70 % of similarity. The first was composed by the dominant species S. rastrifer, C. spixii and C. leiarchus, and the second was formed by C. jamaicensis and P. harroweri, presents almost exclusively in the summer and autumn...|$|E
40|$|Coastal dune {{systems are}} {{particularly}} fragile and threatened environments, which, however, provide fundamental ecosystem services to nearby urban areas acting for example as protective buffers against erosion. Correctly assessing their conservation status {{is a priority}} in order to manage them adequately and to plan urban development in coastal regions. In this {{paper we propose a}} practical multiscale method for the assessment of the conservation status of sandy coastal environment. The proposed method is articulated in two stages, one focusing on the landscape and the other on the plant community level. In the first phase mosaic structure and composition of the coastal landscape are analyzed using a series of indicators: natural coastal surface, richness of land cover typologies, landscape diversity and evenness, number and average size of habitat patches, and mean shape index. At a detailed scale, floristic, vegetational and structural aspects of the dune plant communities are analyzed along the main environmental gradient by measuring: spatial connectivity and richness of boundaries, species diversity, <b>eveness</b> and chorological index. In this work we apply and test the method in an experimental area on the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy (Latium region), comparing the conservation status of two study sites...|$|E

At {{least two of}} these ridges, at 7 - 13 m and 15 - 30 m depth, are drowned early Holocene coral reefs of 5 ky and 7 ky uncorrected radiocarbon age, respectively. Previous work {{has shown that the}} present reef communities growing on these ridges can be detected and mapped using acoustic remote sensing and has suggested that different benthic assemblages may exist between each of these reefs. In this study, in situ community data was taken in four corridors on each reef using fifty-meter line-intercept transects. Multidimensional scaling analyses of the in situ community data show distinct differences in benthic community structure across several spatial gradients within the county. This clustering agrees well with an acoustic data set, taken in the same four corridors along the Broward County coast. Analysis of diversity statistics revealed that whereas species diversity (H’) was consistent throughout the county, species richness (d) and <b>eveness</b> (J’) increased along a north-south gradient. Total scleractinian cover was generally low in all areas (3 ̆c 6...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the effects of}} the intensive fish-farming and the domestic wastewater on the structure of the phycoperiphyton community. Three experimental supports containing artificial substrate were assembled in two sampling sites: IF – region with intensive fish-farming and DW – near the domestic wastewater discharge. Samplings were carried out after the 21 st, 26 th and 31 st day of colonization. The abiotic variables evaluated were: transparency, electrical conductivity, pH, turbidity, total suspended solids, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, water temperature and nutrients. Phycoperiphyton was examined with regard to density, richness, abundance, dominance, diversity and <b>eveness.</b> Nutrients (total nitrogen, nitrate, ammonia nitrogen, orthophosphate and silicate) were different among the sampling sites. Although the total density, richness, diversity and evenness of phycoperiphyton were not affected by the different impacts, the density by class had differences between the sampling sites, with Bacillariophyceae presenting higher density at IF and Cyanophyceae and Coscinodiscophyceae at DW. Four taxa have been associated with the impact by domestic wastewater, and four, to the intensive fish-farming. The density by class of phycoperiphyton was the best attribute to evaluate the effects of human activity.   <br /...|$|E
