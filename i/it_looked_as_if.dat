5|$|The {{aggressive}} {{style of}} Sobers and South-Australia captain Les Favell heavily influenced Chappell during his formative years in senior cricket. In 1962–63, Chappell made his initial first-class century against a New South Wales {{team led by}} Australian captain Richie Benaud, who was bemused by the young batsman's habit of gritting his teeth as he faced up; to Benaud, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he was grinning. Chappell spent the northern summer of 1963 as a professional in England's Lancashire League with Ramsbottom and played a single first-class match for Lancashire against Cambridge University.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of the low}} wage at América Mineiro, he {{was forced}} to quit {{football}} to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> this {{would be the end of}} his childhood dream. As a factory-worker Gilberto earned the equivalent of about £50 a month by 2002 rates. After three years of working in a factory, the 18-year-old decided to try his luck at football again by enrolling in the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last long due to the worsening situation at home as a result of his mother's ill health; he returned to work in the sweet factory with little hope of resurrecting his football career.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most}} effective and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E

5|$|United won {{a corner}} {{just as the}} fourth {{official}} indicated three minutes of injury time, and with so little time left for an equaliser, Peter Schmeichel ventured up to Bayern's penalty area. Beckham flighted the corner in just over Schmeichel's head, Dwight Yorke put the ball back towards the crowded area, and after Thorsten Fink failed to clear sufficiently, the ball arrived {{at the feet of}} Ryan Giggs {{on the edge of the}} area. His right-footed snap-shot was weak and poorly struck, but it went straight to Sheringham, who swiped at the shot with his right foot, and nestled the ball in the bottom corner of the net. The goal was timed at 90+0:36'. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if,</b> having been behind for most of the match, United had forced extra time.|$|E
5|$|With Ortona and Villa Grande captured, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{it would}} require the Eighth Army only to regather itself and strike one more {{concentrated}} blow at Orsogna to complete the breaching of the Gustav Line's main Adriatic strongpoints. However, on 31 December, as V Corps probed along the coastal plain towards Pescara, a blizzard enveloped the battlefield. Drifting snow, sleet and biting winds paralysed movement and communications on the ground while cloud ceiling and visibility fell to nil and grounded the airforce. Montgomery—realising the Eighth Army {{no longer had the}} strength or conditions to force its way to Pescara and the Via Valeria to Rome—recommended to General Alexander that the Eighth Army offensive should be halted. Alexander agreed but ordered him to maintain aggressive patrolling in order to pin the units of the LXXVI Panzer Corps in the Adriatic sector and prevent Kesselring moving them to reinforce the XIV Panzer Corps front opposite Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark's U.S. Fifth Army where the Allied offensive would continue.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Ó Sé's side would {{dominate}} football {{for the foreseeable}} future. In 2001 he guided Kerry to another Munster title and <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a second consecutive All-Ireland title was on the cards. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final {{proved to be a}} reality check as Meath trounced the Kingdom by 2-14 to 0-5.|$|E

25|$|On August 7, 1872, Hardin {{was wounded}} by a shotgun blast in a {{gambling}} dispute at the Gates Saloon in Trinity, Texas.

Two buckshot pellets penetrated Hardin's kidney and for a time <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he would die.|$|E
25|$|On July 8, 1889, an {{estimated}} 3000 spectators boarded special trains for the secret location, {{which turned out}} to be Richburg, a town just south of Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The fight began at 10:30, and <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Sullivan was going to lose, especially after he vomited during the 44th round. But the champion got his second wind after that, and Kilrain's manager finally threw in the towel after the 75th round.|$|E
25|$|Michael Rasmussen kept {{clear of}} danger on the 182.5km flat route from Marseille to Montpellier to {{maintain}} his hold on the yellow jersey. And <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Tom Boonen would tighten {{his grip on the}} green jersey with Erik Zabel off the pace, but the Belgian lost momentum on the fringes of the crash in the final kilometre and eventually came home 37th. New Zealander Julian Dean hit the deck along with Iker Camaño, Sebastien Hinault, Marcel Sieberg and Fränk Schleck.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the Romans {{were going}} to pay for their failure to {{capitalize}} from the victory at the Metaurus river by conquering the Cisalpine Gauls once and for all, but the danger caused by Mago’s landing was not to be overestimated. Even when he received reinforcements from Carthage in the form of about 7,000 troops, 7 elephants and 25 warships his strength was still far from enough to break the Roman defences. This is why Mago did not seem to actively pursue the goal set by Carthage – to march south and join Hannibal.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Kerry {{were still}} {{the masters of}} provincial {{football}} and Ó Sé guided his county to a sixth Munster title. Kerry later reached a third All-Ireland final under Ó Sé, this time with Armagh providing the opposition. At half-time <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Kerry were on course for the ultimate victory. The Ulstermen lost John McEntee to concussion while Oisín McConville missed a penalty just before the interval. With a four-point lead and playing into the wind Kerry were set. McConville, however, scored a decisive goal in the fifty-fifth minute which stunned Kerry. Ó Sé's side failed to score for the last seventeen minutes as Armagh went on to claim their first All-Ireland title with a 1-12 to 0-14 victory.|$|E
25|$|Keating added {{a second}} league medal to his {{collection}} in 1968 following a 6-27 to 4-22 aggregate defeat of New York. Tipperary later retained {{their status as}} provincial kingpins and a 2-13 to 1-7 trouncing of Cork gave Keating a third Munster medal. For the fourth time of the decade, Wexford were Tipp's opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 1 September 1968. At half-time <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Tipperary were cruising to another victory as they took an eight-point lead. Just after the restart Wexford had a Christy Jacob goal disallowed before Tony Doran scored a goal after just six minutes. Tipp fought back; however, {{it was too late}} as Wexford won a remarkable game by 5-8 to 3-12.|$|E

25|$|When the {{ambulance}} arrived, medics determined Landau and Rosencrantz {{were the most}} seriously wounded {{of the men and}} took to the hospital immediately. A second ambulance was called for to take Schultz and Berman. Berman was unconscious, but Schultz was drifting in and out of lucidity, as police attempted to comfort him and get information. Because the medics had no pain relievers, Schultz was given brandy to relieve his suffering. When the second ambulance arrived, Schultz gave one of the medics $10,000 in cash to see that he received the best treatment. After surgery, when <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Schultz would live, the medic was so worried that he would be indebted to the mobster for keeping the money that he shoved the money back in bed with Schultz.|$|E
25|$|The {{capture of}} Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez and Mario Cárdenas Guillén leaves the Gulf Cartel without a {{definite}} successor. Both arrests in effect {{wipe out the}} traditional old-time bosses of the cartel, {{putting an end to}} a generation of drug traffickers. When Cárdenas Guillén was arrested on 4 September 2012, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Costilla Sánchez had finally won the leadership of the Gulf Cartel. Throughout the end of 2011 and until the time of his arrest in 2012, Costilla Sánchez had carried out a campaign to put down Cárdenas Guillén and his faction – the Rojos – by reportedly setting up its members to get arrested or killed. His attempts to successfully put down his rivals allegedly gave him the protection of some high-ranking officials in the Mexican Armed Forces.|$|E
25|$|Athy {{had to wait}} 24 {{years before}} {{reaching}} the summit of Kildare Senior Football once again. On 9 October 2011 in St Conleths Park Newbridge Michael Foley captained a young Athy side to victory against Carbury with a final score of 2.11 to 2.07. Athy scored 2–5 in the opening 15 minutes and two points in the closing four minutes but managed just four points in between, a period during which Carbury accumulated 2–4. Indeed, when Daryl O'Brien rasped home Carbury's second goal in the 57th minute {{to cut the deficit}} to two points, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they might have timed their run to perfection. The next score was crucial and it went Athy's way as Man of the Match Cian Reynolds held his nerve and calmly pointed a free.|$|E
