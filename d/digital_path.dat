The architecture {{is based on}} a hybrid modulator, wherein hybrid integrators replace conventional analog integrators. The hybrid integrator, which is a combination of an analog integrator and a digital integrator, offers an increased dynamic range and helps make the resulting high-order modulator stable. However, the hybrid modulator relies on precise matching of analog and <b>digital</b> <b>paths.</b> In this paper, a cal-ibration technique to alleviate possible mismatch between analog and <b>digital</b> <b>paths</b> is proposed.

40|$|The all-digital {{transmission}} path {{is quite common}} in today’s FM radio broadcast facility: from contentsource on through to the modulation and RF generation stages. With the above system, stereo generation (MPX) must {{be done in the}} exciter, when it should be performed in the audio processor. Present systems, while they work electronically, pose problems with regards to modulation overshoots due to sample rate converters and the connection method of using AES/EBU. This has been researched and documented with numerous exciters and audio processors. This problem is not limited to just one type of configuration or specific product. This paper offers an in-depth look at these problems, and states their cause. Discussion will reveal a new concept for high performance MPX generation and interconnectivity to an audio processor.

OVERVIEW The rollout of HD Radio presents a whole new level of challenge for digital FM exciters and related audio technology. What is the point of a clear, digital transmission if the source is “dirty”? Modulation performance of digital exciters for the analog, or conventional channel, continues to under-whelm broadcasters. We have found that using AES/EBU between the output of an FM audio processor and input to a digital exciter can cause modulation overshoots. This is not a unique problem to one specific processor or exciter. The fundamental problem with AES/EBU connectivity is that the audio is in separate left and right audio channels, forcing the exciter to perform the multiplex stereo generator function. When ancillary operations such as sample rate conversion, additional low pass filtering, and exciter based limiting, are added to the system, overshoots occur...|$|E

In brief, digitization enhances pleasure for the public and usefulness to experts on cultural heritage assets. This special issue was organized following the success of the First International Workshop on Multimedia for Cultural Heritage (MM 4 CH 2011) which was held on May 2011 in Modena, Italy, with the aim of creating a profitable informal working day to discuss hot topics in multimedia, with specific application to cultural heritage. After the workshop an open call for paper was distributed and we collected 18 submission, of which 7 were extended versions of the originating workshop. After two rounds of review 11 papers were accepted for the special issue, 8 as full papers and 3 as case studies. Papers have been contributed from many countries (USA, Italy, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Greece, Brazil) showing the universal importance of cultural heritage. The paper by Rakthanmanon et. al. introduces an efficient and scalable system that can detect approximately repeated occurrences of shape patterns both within and between historical texts. They show that this ability to find repeated shapes allows automatic annotation of manuscripts, and allows users to trace the evolution of ideas. The paper by Schindler and Dellaert instead uses computer vision techniques to tie together large sets of historical photographs of a given city into a consistent 4 D model of the city: a 3 D model with time as an additional dimension. Larue et. al. introduce a novel approach intended to simplify the production of multimedia content from real objects for the purpose of knowledge sharing, which is particularly appropriate to the cultural heritage field. Cultural Heritage is not just made by visual archives (such as manuscripts or photographs), but also by audio and music resources. The paper by Montecchio et. al. presents a comprehensive methodology for automatic music identification, whose main application is to provide tools to enrich and validate the descriptors of recordings digitized by a sound archive institution. Nouza et. al. describe a software platform that for the automatic transcription and indexation of the Czech Radio archive of spoken documents. The archive contains more than 100. 000 hours of audio recordings covering almost ninety years of public broadcasting. In the context of two relevant examples of intangible cultural heritages, such as music and theater, Baratè et. al. present an approach to online fruition of live performances, encoding information with an extension of the international standard IEEE 1599. One of the key elements in multimedia systems is the ability to also search information by data content, and the two papers closing the full paper section del exactly with this problem. The paper by Roman-Rangel et. al. presents recent advancements made towards the design of an efficient content-based retrieval engine for epigraphic versions of Maya hieroglyphs. They describe a systematic study to assess the quality of recently proposed techniques to represent and retrieve images, together with an effective simplified formulation of the HOOSC descriptor that improves the retrieval performance. Kollia et. al. present a new semantic search methodology, including a query answering mechanism which meets the semantics of users’ queries and enriches the answers by exploiting appropriate visual features through an interweaved knowledge and machine learning based approach. An experimental study is presented, using content from the Europeana digital library. Three case studies complete the Special Issue: Mendes et. al. present the development of an effective web-based 3 D visualization system whose architecture offers an easy and fast interactivity with 3 D models even when limited computer resources are available, adopted in the Universidade Federal do Parana (UFPR) in Brazil, providing an important tool to promote research, educational, social and cultural activities. The paper by Stanco et. al. present a real-time interaction system for ancient artifacts digitally restored in a virtual environment. Using commercial hardware and open source software, Augmented Reality versions of archaeological artifacts are made accessible on mobile devices. The case study for this project is represented by two artifacts of Syracuse, Italy, a statue and an altar, dated back to Hellenistic time. Finally Agosti and Orio report on a study on user requirements carried out on two groups of users: domain specialized users (professional researchers). A digital archive of illuminated manuscripts has been used as a case study for recollecting user requirements. The relations between these two outcomes provide relevant insights on the role of digital resources for the study and dissemination of cultural heritage. We would like to thank the authors for their hard work in the preparation and revision of the manuscripts and for their high quality contributions. We also owe deep gratitude to the MM 4 CH 2011 program committee members and to the additional reviewers for the effort they put in selecting the best works and for the demanding requirements and thorough comments which strongly improved many papers.

Such procedure can be effective for different types of noise but fail in the presence of multiplicative noise. To increase the filtering efficiency for this type of disturbances, we introduce some improvements of the basic concept and new classes of similarity functions and finally extend our techniques to a spatiotemporal domain.

40|$|The {{resolution}} of the <b>digital</b> signal <b>path</b> has a crucial impact on the design, performance and the power dissipation of the radio receiver data path, downstream from the ADC. The ADC quantization noise has been traditionally included with the Front End receiver noise in calculating the SNR as well as BER for the receiver. Using the IEEE 802. 15. 4 as an example, we show that this approach leads to an over-design for the ADC and the <b>digital</b> signal <b>path,</b> resulting in larger power. More accurate specifications for the front-end design {{can be obtained by}} making SNRreg a function of signal resolutions. We show that lower resolution signals provide adequate performance and quantization noise alone does not produce any bit-error.

Several problems with performance enhancement and precise oscillator control using analog circuits in low-voltage submicron CMOS processes, coupled with the fact that analog (or semi-digital) oscillators having various advantages over their digitally controlled counterparts, prompted the proposal of the digitally-controlled phase-locked loop. This research, then, investigates a class of otherwise analog PLLs that use a <b>digital</b> control <b>path</b> for driving a current-controlled oscillator. For this purpose, a novel method for control digitization is described where trains of pulses code the phase/frequency comparison information rather than the duration of the pulses: Pulse-Stream Coded Phase-Locked Loop (psc-PLL). 	This work addresses issues significant to the design of future PLLs through a comparative study of the proposed <b>digital</b> control <b>path</b> topology and improved cutting-edge charge-pump PLLs.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a third-order Σ∆ modulator targeted for WCDMA applications. The architecture uses two operational amplifiers and distributed fully <b>digital</b> feed-forward <b>paths</b> to minimize the output swing of op-amps. Simulation results show that first and second integrator output swings are reduced by 88 % and 75 %, respectively. Post-layout simulation results of the modulator, designed in 65 -nm CMOS technology, give a SNDR of 83 dB over a signal bandwidth of 2. 2 MHz. The power consumption is 2. 3 mW and the achieved FoM is equal to 172. 8 dB. I...|$|R
