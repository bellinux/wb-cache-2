5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{runs out}} to a supermarket parking lot where he witnesses a lawyer, Alistair Pepper (Richard Cox), being confronted {{by a man named}} Sammael (Rodney Eastman). Sammael raises <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> a bolt of lightning arcs from his fingers to strike Pepper dead; however, when Black reaches Sammael, he finds a pistol at the killer's feet.|$|E
5|$|A {{photograph}} from Leon's {{apartment and}} the snake scale lead Deckard to {{a strip club}} where Zhora works. After a confrontation and chase, Deckard kills Zhora. Bryant orders him to also retire Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. After Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, he is attacked by Leon, who knocks Deckard's pistol from <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> then begins to kill Deckard, but Rachael uses Deckard's pistol to kill Leon. They return to Deckard's apartment, and, during an intimate discussion, he promises not to track her down; as she abruptly tries to leave, Deckard restrains her, forcing her to kiss him.|$|E

5|$|In January of the 2015–16 season, Paul led the Clippers on a ten-game {{winning streak}} despite missing Griffin and Jordan {{at various points}} due to injury. For the third {{straight}} year, he finished the season with averages of over 19 points, 10 assists, and 2 steals per game. To begin the postseason, the Clippers drew a matchup with the Portland Trail Blazers, taking a 2–1 lead to start the series. In Game 4, Paul broke <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> was ruled out indefinitely. Without Paul, as well as Griffin, who also injured himself in Game 4, Los Angeles eventually lost the series in six games.|$|E
5|$|In early August Sudirman {{approached}} Sukarno {{and asked}} him to continue the guerrilla war; Sudirman did not expect the Dutch to abide by the Roem-Royen Agreement, based on the failings of the previous agreements. Sukarno disagreed, which was a blow to Sudirman. When Sudirman threatened to resign his post, blaming the government's inconsistency for his tuberculosis and Oerip's death in November 1948, Sukarno threatened to do so as well. As he thought that such a resignation would have a destabilising effect, Sudirman stayed <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> a Java-wide cease fire came into effect on 11August 1949.|$|E
5|$|On August 22, 1984, Eastwood {{was honored}} at a {{ceremony}} at Grauman's Chinese theater to record <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> footprints in cement. Eastwood received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1996, and received an honorary degree from AFI in 2009. On December 6, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Eastwood into the California Hall of Fame located at The California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts.|$|E

5|$|Other portraits {{include one}} by William Nicholson dating from 1814 in which Bewick sits {{with a pencil}} in <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a dog beside his chair; the one at his birthplace; and the {{full-length}} seated portrait of 1827 by Thomas Sword Good (see above). Another painting by Sword in the National Portrait Gallery is now no longer thought to be of Bewick. An unsigned painting supposedly {{of him in the}} Yale Center for British Art is equally dubious.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Varanasi {{was founded}} by the god Shiva. There {{happened}} a fight between the two supreme gods, Brahma and Shiva, and the succeeding combat resulted {{in one of the}} five heads of Brahma being torn off by Shiva. It was a custom of the time that the victor carried the slain adversary’s head in <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. The land of Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy religious site.|$|E
5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with his sleeves rolled up, a tea towel in <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E

5|$|Bond {{flies to}} Imperial Iran (Persia) to investigate. Gorner owns {{factories}} and produces legitimate pharmaceuticals, however MI6 suspects he has other motives. During Bond's investigation he identifies Gorner {{due to a}} deformity of <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> establishes Gorner's complicity in a scheme to not only flood Europe with cheap drugs but also to launch a two-pronged terrorist attack on the Soviet Union, whose retaliation will subsequently devastate the UK. The attack is to be made using a stolen British airliner, earlier hijacked over Iraqi airspace, and an ekranoplan. Bond is assisted in his investigation by Scarlett Papava (whose twin sister Poppy is under Gorner's emotional spell), Darius Alizadeh (the local head of station), JD Silver (an in-situ agent), and Felix Leiter.|$|E
5|$|Chris {{begins a}} career as a {{rickshaw}} driver, Stewie takes a job at sewing shoes (but is fired after sewing a shoe to <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> replaced with a baby). Peter becomes a sumo wrestler, but is spotted by Joe on the television shortly afterward. Joe successfully tracks the family down and pursues them through Asiantown, leading them into the city sewers. Lois decides to surrender and face the consequences so {{that the rest of the}} family won't have to, but as Joe attempts to detain her, he slips in the sewer and is almost swept off a nearby ledge. Lois pulls Joe to safety, and in gratitude, Joe manages to get Lois' sentence cancelled, and life returns to normal for the family.|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{is called}} to a crime scene at the {{abandoned}} hospital where, last night, the Ice Truck Killer left security guard Tony Tucci (Brad William Henke) strapped to a table for Dexter to kill. Instead, Dexter had reported the crime scene and Tucci had been hospitalized after the Killer had amputated <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> leg. Debra and Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) question Tucci when he wakes up in hospital, but Doakes is unimpressed with Debra's ways of extracting information from Tucci. He disapproves of her suggestion to blindfold Tucci to help him to remember his encounter with the Killer, but after she confronts him about his attitude toward her, he agrees to blindfold Tucci, who remembers that the Killer used throat lozenges. They return {{to the crime scene}} and find a lozenge wrapper, on which forensics expert Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee) finds a partial fingerprint.|$|E

5|$|Massive Dynamic {{executive}} Mark Young (Ptolemy Slocum) {{delivers a}} {{presentation at the}} company’s Manhattan office. When he is done and the other attendees have left, he sees an unusual butterfly. Upon picking it up, he experiences a cut on <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> is then attacked by a swarm. Mark jumps out of a window, to his death. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), despite preparing {{to go out to}} dinner with her sister, instead agrees to Phillip Broyles' (Lance Reddick) demand that she join the Fringe team's investigation at the scene. While examining the body, Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) sees lacerations on Young’s skin and notes a lack of corresponding tears on his shirt. At the scene, Olivia has a brief vision of her deceased lover John Scott (Mark Valley) watching them, which troubles her.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) talks {{briefly to}} Sen. Lipton about animal rights, and Lipton (who Oscar {{suspects}} is gay) gives Oscar his private cell phone number, asking Oscar {{to call him}} in the evening to discuss issues further. Oscar tells Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that the Senator was hitting on him. Jim says Lipton was likely just schmoozing a voter, talks to Lipton himself, and also gets his number. Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) later gets Lipton's number as well, resulting in Oscar thinking that the senator {{may not have been}} hitting on him. When Oscar is leaving, Lipton shakes <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> caresses Oscar's arm for long enough that Oscar once again believes Lipton was pursuing him.|$|E
5|$|The Great Silence was one {{of several}} Spaghetti Westerns {{produced}} between 1967 and 1968, along with Enzo G. Castellari's Kill Them All and Come Back Alone and One Dollar Too Many, Sergio Sollima's Run, Man, Run and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West, to be showcased in Patrick Morin's made-for-television documentary Western, Italian Style. During the making of the film, Corbucci and Trintignant were interviewed; Corbucci discussed the nature of violence in his films and Spaghetti Westerns in general (comparing the use of violence in such films to the James Bond franchise), while Trintignant spoke of the unusual nature of his role and how he would practice drawing his gun – by pulling a sock (substituting for the gloves Silence wears in the film) off <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> reaching for a long-steamed artichoke in his pocket.|$|E

5|$|The MCC were {{reluctant}} to tour so soon after the war, but the Australian authorities were insistent. The tourists, led once more by Wally Hammond, were beaten 3–0 in the Test series, finding their opponents much stronger than expected. Hutton began the tour well, scoring two early centuries, the latter of which was described by Wisden as the best English innings of the tour. A string of other good performances drew praise from press and former players; one such report named him the best batsman in the world. However, Hutton failed to reach a score of 50 runs {{in the first three}} Tests; in the first, he was out for a first ball duck, and in the second, a short ball from Keith Miller struck him on his injured arm. In the second innings of the latter game, he quickly scored 37, frequently driving the bowling of Miller and Fred Freer before the bat slipped from <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> hit the wicket, ending the innings. Even so, the display was praised by critics.|$|E
5|$|The chancel {{contains}} memorials to the Lords Stanley of Alderley. The {{memorial to}} John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley contains his effigy dressed in peer's robes lying under a canopy {{with his hand}} on a book, dated 1856 and by Richard Westmacott. On {{the other side of the}} chancel is a memorial to his son Edward Stanley, his effigy holding a scroll in <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> with a dog at his feet. Engraved in brass on the side of the memorial are the figures of his widow and children. Lady Stanley is seated in the middle with their four surviving sons on her right, five surviving daughters on her left and three children who had died at a young age at her knee and on her lap. A memorial tablet to John Constantine Stanley, who died in 1878, is by Joseph Boehm. The chancel contains a monument to Rev.Edward Shipton, rector of the church from 1625 to 1630.|$|E
5|$|A {{fortnight}} later, Miller {{proceeded to}} the Second Test in Sydney, {{where he had}} a quiet match without his partner Lindwall, who was sidelined with chickenpox. England batted first and Miller opened the bowling with Victorian teammate and debutant Fred Freer. Miller bowled nine overs without success, conceding 24 runs as Hammond's tourists amassed 270. On a turning surface, nine of the English wickets fell to the spinners Johnson and McCool. In the hosts' reply, Miller contributed 40 with seven fours in a 63-run stand with Barnes as Australia reached 4/159. Bradman—who had dropped himself down the order—and Barnes then both scored 234 and put together a world record fifth-wicket partnership of 405 to propel Australia to 8/659 declared. Miller bowled 11 overs in the second innings, taking the wicket of Hutton who was out hit wicket after going on a short-lived attack that yielded 37 runs from 39 balls in 24 minutes. Hutton shaped to drive the last ball before lunch, and successfully made contact, but in following through, his bat slipped from <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> clipped the stumps. Miller had a light bowling workload as Johnson and McCool took seven wickets between them for the innings and eight wickets each for the match as Australia completed another innings victory.|$|E
