2500|$|Alcoholic {{hepatitis}} {{is characterized}} by the inflammation of hepatocytes. Between 10% and 35% of heavy drinkers develop alcoholic hepatitis (NIAAA, 1993). [...] While development of hepatitis is not directly related to the dose of alcohol, some people seem more prone to this reaction than others. [...] This is called alcoholic steato necrosis and the inflammation appears to predispose to liver fibrosis. Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL6 and IL8) are thought to be essential in the initiation and perpetuation of liver injury by inducing apoptosis and necrosis. One possible mechanism for the increased activity of TNF-α is the increased <b>intestinal</b> <b>permeability</b> due to liver disease. This facilitates the absorption of the gut-produced endotoxin into the portal circulation. The Kupffer cells of the liver then phagocytose endotoxin, stimulating the release of TNF-α. TNF-α then triggers apoptotic pathways through the activation of caspases, resulting in cell death.|$|E

Biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics properties of the two compounds have been characterized in vitro, in situ {{as well as in}} rats. Based on the identified biopharmaceutics characteristics of the two compounds, the effect of chitosan derivatives as an absorption enhancer on the intestinal absorption and pharmacokinetics of FTA and CHA in pure compound form as well as extract form were investigated in vitro, in situ and in vivo. Both FTA and CHA demonstrated very limited <b>intestinal</b> <b>permeabilities,</b> leading to oral bioavailabilities being only 0. 50 % and 0. 13 % in rats, respectively. Results from both in vitro, in situ as well as in vivo studies consistently indicated that Chito-oligosaccharide (COS) at dosage of 25 mg/kg could enhance <b>intestinal</b> <b>permeabilities</b> significantly as well as the in vivo bioavailabilities of both FTA and CHA than CMCs in Flos Lonicerae- Fructus Forsythiae herb couple preparations, and was safe for gastrointestine from morphological observation. Besides, treatment with Flos Lonicerae- Fructus Forsythiae herb couple preparations with COS at the dosage of 25 mg/kg prevented MDCK damage after influenza virus propagation, which was significantly better than control.

The dipeptides displayed {{a significant increase}} in their permeabilities compared to L-α-methyldopa. The increases ranged from 4 to 20 times. These results suggest that the peptide transport system is less structurally specific than the amino acid transport systems and can be used as an absorption pathway for peptide analogues. The kinetic advantage demonstrated by the dipeptide, L-α-methyldopa-L-phenylalanine, over the amino acid analogue, L-α-methyldopa, suggests that the peptide carrier would be a possible route for improving the intestinal absorption of pharmacologically active amino acid analogues.

40|$|Chronic non-communicable {{diseases}} (NCDs) are {{the leading}} causes of work absence, disability and mortality worldwide. Most of these diseases are associated with low-grade inflammation. Here we hypothesize that stresses (defined as homeostatic disturbances) can induce low-grade inflammation by increasing the availability of water, sodium and energy-rich substances to meet the increased metabolic demand induced by the stressor. One way of triggering low-grade inflammation is by increasing <b>intestinal</b> barrier <b>permeability</b> through activation of various components of the stress system. Although beneficial {{to meet the demands}} necessary during stress, increased <b>intestinal</b> barrier <b>permeability</b> also raises the possibility of the translocation of bacteria and their toxins across the intestinal lumen into the blood circulation. In combination with modern life-style factors, the increase in bacteria/bacterial toxin translocation arising from a more permeable intestinal wall causes a low-grade inflammatory state. We support this hypothesis with numerous studies finding associations with NCDs and markers of endotoxemia, suggesting that this process plays a pivotal and perhaps even a causal {{role in the development of}} low-grade inflammation and its related diseases...|$|R
40|$|SummaryMice lacking {{junctional}} {{adhesion molecule}} A (JAM-A, encoded by F 11 r) exhibit enhanced <b>intestinal</b> epithelial <b>permeability,</b> bacterial translocation, and elevated colonic lymphocyte numbers, yet do not develop colitis. To investigate {{the contribution of}} adaptive immune compensation in response to increased <b>intestinal</b> epithelial <b>permeability,</b> we examined the susceptibility of F 11 r−/−Rag 1 −/− mice to acute colitis. Although negligible contributions of adaptive immunity in F 11 r+/+Rag 1 −/− mice were observed, F 11 r−/−Rag 1 −/− mice exhibited increased microflora-dependent colitis. Elimination of T cell subsets and cytokine analyses revealed a protective role for TGF-β-producing CD 4 + T cells in F 11 r−/− mice. Additionally, loss of JAM-A resulted in elevated mucosal and serum IgA that was dependent upon CD 4 + T cells and TGF-β. Absence of IgA in F 11 r+/+Igha−/− mice did not affect disease, whereas F 11 r−/−Igha−/− mice displayed markedly increased susceptibility to acute injury-induced colitis. These data establish a role for adaptive immune-mediated protection from acute colitis under conditions of intestinal epithelial barrier compromise...|$|R
40|$|Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) was {{explored}} as a {{means for}} physicochemical and biopharmaceutical characterisation of small drug molecules. Special attention was paid to the characterisation of acid-base and lipophilic properties of drug compounds by analysing their migration behaviour in different CE systems. The thesis comprises an overview of the field together with separate studies on the different topics. The utility of CE for the determination of pKa of labile drug compounds was investigated. A general methodology was developed comprising key steps {{such as the use of}} a stabilising sample diluent, electromigration injection, and analyte characterisation by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The methodology was successfully applied for two sets of drug compounds, labile at low and high pH, respectively. CE was also evaluated for experimental modelling of passive <b>intestinal</b> membrane <b>permeability</b> by studying analyte migration in liposomal, microemulsion and micellar electrolytes. Good correlation is reported between CE migration and Caco- 2 cell absorption estimates and for in vitro inhibition of thrombin. Interestingly, a slightly better correlation was obtained for liposomal electrolytes. The utility of liposomes in CE was further extended by developing a novel procedure for immobilising liposomes inside fused silica capillaries. This approach enabled direct on-line coupling of liposome CE to high sensitivity mass spectrometry. The utility of liposome-coated capillaries is demonstrated for estimating drug passive <b>intestinal</b> membrane <b>permeability.</b> Its use in biopharmaceutical drug profiling is discussed. Utilising advanced molecular descriptors, commonly applied to in silico prediction of passive <b>intestinal</b> membrane <b>permeability,</b> migration of analytes in micellar CE systems could be well predicted. The novel approach was based on hierarchical multivariate analytics and use of molecular descriptors for both analytes and micellar media surfactants. Demonstrated results propose that the CE format could be useful to validate how representative molecular descriptors are for describing molecular behaviour in complex liquid media, e. g. physiological systems...|$|R

40|$|Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is an {{important}} proinflammatory cytokine that plays {{a central role in}} the intestinal inflammatory process of inflammatory bowel disease. IFN-γ induced disturbance of the intestinal epithelial tight junction (TJ) barrier has been postulated to be {{an important}} mechanism contributing to intestinal inflammation. The intracellular mechanisms that mediate the IFN-γ induced increase in <b>intestinal</b> TJ <b>permeability</b> remain unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the role of the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -K) pathway in the regulation of the IFN-γ induced increase in <b>intestinal</b> TJ <b>permeability</b> using the T 84 intestinal epithelial cell line. IFN-γ caused an increase in T 84 <b>intestinal</b> epithelial TJ <b>permeability</b> and depletion of TJ protein, occludin. The IFN-γ induced increase in TJ permeability and alteration in occludin protein was associated with rapid activation of PI 3 -K; and inhibition of PI 3 -K activation prevented the IFN-γ induced effects. IFN-γ also caused a delayed but more prolonged activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB); inhibition of NF-κB also prevented the increase in T 84 TJ permeability and alteration in occludin expression. The IFN-γ induced activation of NF-κB was mediated by a cross-talk with PI 3 -K pathway. In conclusion, the IFN-γ induced increase in T 84 TJ permeability and alteration in occludin protein expression were mediated by the PI 3 -K pathway. These results show for the first time that the IFN-γ modulation of TJ protein and TJ barrier function is regulated by a cross-talk between PI 3 -K and NF-κB pathways...|$|R
40|$|Ion {{and water}} permeabilities were {{measured}} in the isolated esophagus of the eel (Anguilla anguilla and A. japonica), and compared {{with those in the}} stomach and the intestine. The freshwater eel esophagus was impermeable both to Na+ and Cl- ions and to water, whereas permeabilities to the ions increased selectively after seawater adaptation. The ion permeabilities of both the freshwater and the seawater eel stomach were lower than in the seawater eel esophagus, although water permeability was greater than in the esophagus. Sea water enclosed in the lumen was diluted three times more efficiently in the seawater eel esophagus than in the stomach. The <b>intestinal</b> <b>permeabilities</b> were greater than those of the esophagus and the stomach, and increased after seawater adaptation. In the eel, ingested sea water seems to be diluted mainly in the esophagus by passive diffusion of the ions into the blood without addition of water.

The absorption of phenylpropionylproline, phenylacetyl-α-methyldopa, and N -benzoylproline was concentration dependent. The transport parameters (mean ± SD) of phenylpropionylproline and N -benzoylproline were as follows: J max*, 0. 037 (± 0. 019) m M; K m, 0. 045 (± 0. 027) m M; P c*, 0. 830 (± 0. 130); and P m*, 0. 673 ± 0. 049; and J max*, 1. 34 (± 0. 24) m M; K m, 1. 31 (± 0. 30) m M; P c*, 1. 02 (± 0. 11); and P m* 0; respectively. The <b>intestinal</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of phenylpropionylproline, phenylacetylproline, N -benzoylproline, and hippuric acid (N -benzoylglycine) were significantly reduced by dipeptides and ceph-radine.

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} structural features that alter the <b>intestinal</b> epithelial <b>permeability</b> and efflux in a series of novel HIV- 1 protease inhibitors (PIs). Eleven PIs were selected containing a tertiary alcohol in a transition-state mimicking scaffold, in which two substituents (R 1 and R 2) were varied systematically. Indinavir was selected as a reference compound. The apical-to-basolateral permeability was investigated in 2 / 4 /A 1 and Caco- 2 monolayers. In addition, the basolateral-to-apical permeability was investigated in the Caco- 2 monolayers and the efflux ratios were calculated. The absence of active drug transport processes in 2 / 4 /A 1 cells allowed identification and modeling of structural elements affecting the passive permeability. For instance, small aromatic R 1 substituents and a small (bromo-) R 2 substituent were associated with a high passive permeability. Efflux studies in Caco- 2 cells indicated that amide-substituted neutral hydrophobic amino acids, such as valine and leucine, in the R 1 position, reduced the apical-to-basolateral transport and enhanced the efflux. We conclude that our investigation revealed structural features that alter the <b>intestinal</b> epithelial <b>permeability</b> and efflux in the series of PIs and hope that these results can contribute to the synthesis of PIs with improved permeability and limited efflux properties. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 100 : 3763 – 3772, 201...|$|R

Values for the normotensive dogs were 111 mm Hg, 7. 1 mm Hg, 6. 2 ml/hr, and 0. 64, respectively, while values for the chronically hypertensive dogs were 165 mm Hg, 7. 3 mm Hg, 12. 5 ml/hr, and 0. 66, respectively. Control lymph flow in the hypertensives was 100 % greater than in the normotensives, while {{there was no significant}} difference in control CL/CL between the two groups.

Recently we found that Carbon Monoxide-Releasing Molecule- 2 (CORM- 2) is able to protect LPS-induced intestinal epithelial tight junction damage and in this study we will investigate if CORM- 2 could protect intestinal epithelial tight junctions in the rat cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model. The CLP model was generated using male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats according to standard procedure and treated with CORM- 2 or inactive CORM- 2 (iCORM- 2), 8 mg/kg, i. v. immediately after CLP induction and euthanized after 24 h or 72 h (for mortality rate only). Morphological changes were investigated using both transmission electron and confocal microscopy. The levels of important TJ proteins and phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) were examined using Western blotting. Cytokines, IL- 1 β and TNF-α were measured using ELISA kits. The overall <b>intestinal</b> epithelial <b>permeability</b> was evaluated using FD- 4 as a marker.

40|$|Introduction: With {{approximately}} 60, 000 {{deaths per}} year sepsis {{is the third}} {{leading cause of death}} in Germany. Bacterial translocation due to the damage of intestinal epithelial barrier represents an important factor for the development and maintenance of septic course. The sympathetic nervous system influences the endotoxin-induced activation of immunocompetent cells. Study I examined the effects of regional sympathetic blockade by thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) on the endotoxin-induced intestinal leukocyte-endothelial interaction and the consecutive endothelial injury. Study II investigated the impact of TEA on the endotoxin-induced increase in <b>intestinal</b> epithelial <b>permeability.</b> Study III quantified the effect of volume replacement during endotoxemia with either hydroxyethyl starch, gelatin, or isotonic saline on intestinal microcirculatory impairment. Methods: Male rats were anesthetized, cannulated and hemodynamically monitored. Endotoxemia was initiated following the particular study protocol. Animals of study I and II were additionally equipped with an epidural catheter for continuous application of lidocaine or isotonic saline. In study I catecholamine and cytokine concentration in plasma, adhesion molecule expression, leukocyte adhesion and intestinal tissue edema were determined. Study II investigated <b>intestinal</b> epithelial <b>permeability,</b> macrophage expression of inducible NO synthase and 8 -isoprostane tissue concentration. Study III examined the effects of different volume replacement regimes on intestinal functional capillary density, velocity of erythrocytes and mesenteric leukocyte-endothelial interaction. Results: Study I: TEA reduced epinephrine plasma concentration by 32 %. This was associated with a decrease in interleukin- 1 β plasma concentration (48 %), a decrease in expression of endothelial adhesion molecules E-selectin (34 %) and ICAM- 1 (42 %) and a decrease of intestinal tissue edema (75 %). Study II: TEA reduced the endotoxin-induced increase in <b>intestinal</b> epithelial <b>permeability</b> by 30 %. Expression of NO synthase and lipid peroxidation were lessened by 70 % and 59 % respectively. Study III: After fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline the functional capillary density was decreased by 18. 5 %. There were no detectable changes of functional capillary density in the hydroxyethyl starch or gelatin group. Regarding other test parameters significant differences could not be demonstrated. Discussion: Study I and II: The effect of TEA on the adhesion and extravasation of immune cells {{may be due to the}} reduction of plasma epinephrine concentration. Alternatively, a direct influence on the immune cells via nerve connections (nerve-immune interplay) or a systemic effect of lidocaine should be considered. Study III: Under comparable macrohemodynamic parameters and volume status the discrepancy in microcirculation seems to be due to effects like changes in red blood cell rigidity, endothelial swelling or the extent of surrounding tissue edema.
