40|$|There {{are some}} {{expressions}} referring to future time in English because English has no 'future tense' {{equivalent to that}} of Latin or French. In general, English has six types of future expressions. However, all of the expressions do not indicate the same meaning. Each of the expressions has some different usages. The progressive aspect originally refers to 'action in progress' and when it expresses futurity the present progressive means 'future arising from present arrangement, plan or programme'. The combination of be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> with the infinitive generally has two meanings : 'future fulfilment of a present intention' and 'future result of a present cause'. In this paper we {{make it clear that}} be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> implies 'intention' and 'sign'. The modal auxiliary will always means 'modality'. The type of 'modality' can be divided into two : 'root' and 'epistemic'. Each type of 'modality' has a specific meaning; with respect to will the root modality means 'volition' and the epistemic modality means 'prediction'. The event expressed by the present progressive can never be changed by anyone. And be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> only indicates the present 'sign' that the event expressed by be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> will <b>occur</b> or the speaker's 'intention' of present time. It is least certain whether the event referred to by these two expressions will really happen. The construction be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> is regarded as 'present-oriented', whereas will as 'futureoriented'. In order to connect future time with present time be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>occurs</b> first, and then will follows. The sentence containing will is considered as 'elliptical' without a conditional clause. The auxiliary will frequently occurs in the apodosis, because will needs some conditionally. While will is rare in the protasis, be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> is often used there. In this case, will or be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> expresses the meaning of root modality...|$|R

The border of one of the deer walks was at a spot known as Three Downs Place, two miles and a half from Winterbourne Bishop. Here in a hollow of the downs there was an extensive wood, and just within the wood a large stone house, said to be centuries old but long pulled down, called Rollston House, in which the head-keeper lived with two under-keepers.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this talk}} we provide a {{detailed}} account of the formal, functional and semantic changes that be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> underwent in Late Modern English. We know the history of be <b>going</b> <b>to,</b> a classic of grammaticalization studies (see Traugott 2012 for a recent overview), in quite some detail. Specifically for the late modern period, the period of be <b>going</b> <b>to’s</b> maturation, Disney (2009) hypothesises that be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> extended from encoding intention to encoding prediction through increased guessing of other people’s intentions, resulting in its evidential semantics. While invaluable, Disney’s study is based on a limited corpus, and mostly qualitative in nature. We test and refine Disney’s hypothesis, and integrate it into the theory of subjectification (in the sense of Traugott 1989), {{on the basis of a}} large-scale corpus study. Despite be <b>going</b> <b>to’s</b> popularity, such studies remain rare. A recent large-scale study has focused on the initial stages of this process (Petré & Van de Velde 2014), but similar studies are still lacking for the late modern period. Hilpert (2008) provides some insight in the extension to new types of infinitive, but does not really go into details regarding the underlying mechanisms of change. Data are based on an extensive sample from CLMETEV (De Smet, Diller & Tyrkkö 2011) complemented by exhaustive data from PPCMBE (Kroch, Santorini & Diertani 2010). In total, 1257 attestations were analysed on quantifiable, mostly formal features at various levels of the construction, such as contraction of be (substantive level), extension to new subject types (e. g. raised, empty subjects) and types of infinitives (e. g., states rather than actions) (schematic level), and the sentence type and presence of epistemic and evidential marking (level of the host clause). The corpus data reveal that the shift from intention to prediction started to take place in the first half of the eighteenth century, and originated in contexts with third person subjects, often in past tense narratives. Naturally, reporting the intention of others generally involves a certain amount of guesswork. This amount increased by the middle of the eighteenth century, when be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> started <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> with non-imminent infinitival complements. This naturally resulted in an additional, epistemic layer of prediction that gradually gained strength during the second half of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century, allowed the underlying meaning of intention to wither, and the construction to become more and more frequent in the present tense. The shift from intention to prediction is arguably an increase in subjectivity, as the emphasis gradually moved away from the grammatical subject to the speaker: what mattered was no longer the intentions of the subject, but the knowledge of the speaker about them. Traugott (1989) shows that other English epistemic auxiliaries such as will and shall go through a similar stage of subjectification. Interestingly, while there are significant differences between will, shall, and be <b>going</b> <b>to,</b> it appears that each goes through an intermediary stage that involved past tense uses with reference to a future in the past, which was already known to the speaker. From a theoretical point of view, our analysis provides further evidence for recent claims (e. g. De Smet 2012) that grammaticalization follows minimally disruptive pathways, taking the smallest steps possible in the development, and at the same time shows that recurring patterns may be found at this smallest level as well...|$|R

For though Lady Bertram rather shone in the epistolary line, having early in her marriage, from the want of other employment, and the circumstance of Sir Thomas's being in Parliament, got into the way of making and keeping correspondents, and formed for herself a very creditable, common-place, amplifying style, so that a very little matter was enough for her: she could not do entirely without any; she must have something to write about, even to her niece; and being so soon to lose all the benefit of Dr. Grant's gouty symptoms and Mrs. Grant's morning calls, it was very hard upon her to be deprived of one of the last epistolary uses she could put them to.|$|R
