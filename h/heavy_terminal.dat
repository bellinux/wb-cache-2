Phys., 209 (2) : 448 – 476, 2005]. Two cases of vertical plane Poiseuille flow with suspended <b>heavy</b> particles (with <b>terminal</b> particle Reynolds number ≥ 100) are considered, in the laminar {{and in the}} turbulent flow regimes. The solutions obtained for different spatial refinements while keeping the CFL number constant are analyzed. A convergence rate of approximately ∆x 2 is determined for the prediction of the particle motion in the laminar shear flow. A quantitative evaluation of the grid-related discrepancies is presented for the time-dependent individual particle velocity, the Lagrangian particle statistics and the Eulerian fluid statistics in the turbulent case. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{plausible}} surface {{history of}} Mercury is presented which {{is suggested by}} Mariner 10 television pictures. Five periods are postulated which are delineated by successive variations in the modification of the surface by external and internal processes: accretion and differentiation, <b>terminal</b> <b>heavy</b> bombardment, formation of the Caloris basin, flooding of that basin and other areas, and light cratering accumulated on the smooth plains. Each period is described in detail; the overall history is compared with the surface histories of Venus, Mars, and the moon; {{and the implications of}} this history for earth are discussed. It is tentatively concluded that: Mercury is a differentiated planet most likely composed of a large iron core enclosed by a relatively thin silicate layer; heavy surface bombardment occurred about four billion years ago, which probably affected all the inner planets, and was followed by a period of volcanic activity; no surface modifications caused by tectonic, volcanic, or atmospheric processes took place after the volcanic period...|$|R
40|$|Information about Mercury {{obtained}} with the Mariner 10 spacecraft is summarized together with results of theoretical studies and ground-based observations. It is shown that Mercury {{is very likely}} a differentiated body, probably contains a large earthlike iron-rich core, and displays a surface similar to the moon's, which suggests a similar evolutionary history. The size and mass of Mercury are discussed along with its orbit, rotation, atmosphere, magnetic field, and magnetosphere. Surface features of Mercury are described {{on the basis of}} Mariner 10 pictures, with detailed attention given to the major physiographic provinces, the structure of the Caloris basin, the tectonic framework of the planet, crater morphology, the planet's optical and thermal properties, and cartography. The composition and structure of the interior are examined, and the thermal history of Mercury is considered. The planet's geologic history is divided into five stages or epochs: (1) accretion and differentiation, (2) <b>terminal</b> <b>heavy</b> bombardment, (3) Caloris basin formation, (4) basin flooding, and (5) postfilling lighter bombardment...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of lasers it is necessary to develop materials that can provide protection to eyes and other sensitive devices. This thesis reports on an investigation into optical limiting of Transition Metal Acetylides (TMAs) that transmit ambient light levels of light but block high energy (laser) light across the visible part of the spectrum. A standard optical limiting testbed is used to measure opt~callimiting at 470, 532 and 630 om {{for a wide range of}} Pt:ethynyl related TMAs. I report the effect on optical limiting of altering the central bridge, <b>heavy</b> metal, <b>terminal</b> group, solubilising group and oligomerisation. Most of these materials showed poor optical limiting, especially in the red. Two dimers of Pt:ethynyl, however, have clamping levels at 532 om better than that for Pt:ethynyl. I therefore describe a detailed spectroscopic investigation of two series of oligomers and discuss their structure/property relationships. This investigation also includes a precursor ofPtethynyl, PEPE, which shows remarkable limiting. I also report modelling of optical limiting using a 5 -level model constructed using the spectroscopic data. I show that the 5 -level model can be validated and accurately predicts the limiting for PEPE against both ps and ns pulses. It can also be used to predict ps limiting for Pt:ethynyl and its oligomers. For ns pulses, however, it predicts much less limiting than that observed. I therefore propose a new mechanism that is important for ns limiting by TMAs. Finally I discuss the broadband limiting of these materials and from analysis of the measurements· I describe structures of materials that may show promising broadband optical limiting. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|The {{cells of}} the {{endosperm}} of castor bean seeds (Ricinus communis) undergo programmed cell death during germination, after their oil and protein reserves have been mobilized. Nuclear DNA fragmentation first was observed at day 3 in the endosperm cells immediately adjacent to the cotyledons and progressed across to the outermost cell layers by day 5. We also detected the accumulation of small organelles known as ricinosomes, by using an antibody against a cysteine endoprotease. By the time the nuclear DNA was susceptible to <b>heavy</b> label by <b>terminal</b> deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, the ricinosomes had released into the cytoplasm their content of cysteine endoprotease, which became activated because of the cleavage of its propeptide. The cysteine endoprotease is distinguished by a C-terminal KDEL sequence, {{although it is not}} retained in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and is a marker for ricinosomes. Homologous proteases are found in the senescing tissues of other plants, including the petals of the daylily. Ricinosomes were identified in this tissue by electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. It seems that ricinosomes are not unique to Ricinus and {{play an important role in}} the degradation of plant cell contents during programmed cell death...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a popular}} trend among handgun hunters towards heavier bullets, {{with the goal of}} {{increased}} penetration. While a 300 grain bullet in either a. 44 Magnum or a. 45 Colt will shoot through a deer from pretty much any angle, many hunters dream of hunting larger game, and {{spend a lot of time}} thinking about even heavier bullets to obtain similar performance on elk, moose, buffalo and the like. This door to this level of revolver performance was opened by J. D. Jones back in the early 1980 s when he introduced his cast bullet designs, and most notably the 320 grain SSK. 44 Magnum bullet. At that point in time, most bullet manufacturers were limiting their. 44 bullets to 250 - 265 grains. J. D. saw a need for well-designed heavier bullets and answered that need by developing the JDJ line of bullet moulds. In the years that have passed since, others have followed suit with their own designs. The question then arises as to when does more weight become too much weight for the. 44 Magnum? The "conventional wisdom " is that a 300 grain bullet (either cast or jacketed) is the optimum "heavy bullet " weight for the. 44 Magnum, and that anything <b>heavier</b> compromises <b>terminal</b> performance by limiting muzzle velocity. Is this really true, or is it just more gun-shop hot air? The 320 grain SSK has an excellent reputation, having taken everything from elk to elephant, but are some of the newer. 44 heavyweights even better? There are commercial. 44 Magnum loads that go up to 350 grains, and commercial hardcast bullets that allow the handloader to go as heavy as 405 grains. For example, Randy Garrett uses 310 grain bullets (with a. 320 " meplat) at 1325 fps in his Sledgehammer. 44 Magnum loads (Garrett Cartridges). Cor-Bon has hardcast heavyweight loads featuring a 305 grain flat-point penetrator at 1300 fps, and a 320 grainer at 1270 fps. Buffalo Bore offers a 305 grain LBT LFN at 1325 fps, and has a commentary on their website about overly large meplats and how they can limit penetration. These are some of the 300 + grain loads that are marketed for all. 44 Magnum revolvers, there are also heavier loads marketed specifically for the Ruger Super Redhawk that are too long for th...|$|R
40|$|Hemophilia B is a {{bleeding}} disorder caused by deficiency in blood clotting factor IX (FIX). FIX circulates as a 55 – 57 kDa inactive precursor of the serine protease, FIXa. Activation {{results in the}} release of the activation peptide to generate an amino terminal light chain of Mr∼ 18, 000 and a carboxyl <b>terminal</b> <b>heavy</b> chain of Mr∼ 28, 000 linked by a disulfide bridge. The light chain consists of the γ-carboxyglutamic acid rich gla domain, followed by two epidermal growth factor-like domains. The gla domain contains several low affinity divalent metal ion binding sites and primarily gives FIX its metal-dependent conformation. The heavy chain contains the catalytic domain, conferring proteolytic activity to FIXa. The biosynthesis of recombinant human FIX in the milk of transgenic pigs (tg-rhFIX) at 3 ̆e 100 units coagulation activity per ml creates several major subpopulations that differ primarily in the content of γ-carboxyglutamic acid. Using a final purification step of size exclusion chromatography with saturating [Ca 2 +], we generated three distinctive subpopulation pools of tg-rhFIX based on gla content: low gla (3 ̆c 6), 3 ̆e 6 gla and high gla (3 ̆e 9 gla). Each pool exhibited different biological and structural characteristics. Biological activity and FIXa content increased for higher gla pools. Binding to metal-dependent monoclonal antibodies and phospholipid also increased for higher gla pools. ^ Recent pharmacokinetic studies with tg-rhFIX show differences in the biological recoveries of the three pools while antigen recoveries are similar. We hypothesize that the three pools undergo proteolytic degradation differently. In vitro treatment by plasmin of tg-rhFIX with varied gla exhibited contrasting degradation in the presence of calcium or EDTA. Higher gla content species showed greater plasmin mediated proteolysis to form Factor IXα in the presence of Ca 2 + and the lower gla content species showed increased production of Factor IXγ. While Factor IXα retains procoagulation activity, Factor IXγ has its putative exosite for FX binding disrupted thereby rendering it inactive. This is the first report of gla-dependant conformational effects upon plasmin cleavage of FIX. ...|$|R
40|$|Cryptosporidium parvum is a coccidian {{protozoan}} that colonizes {{epithelial cells}} lining respiratory and digestive tracts {{of animals and}} humans. Cryptosporidiosis is a well-recognized zoonotic disease infecting primarily neonates and immunocompromised hosts, including human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Clinical disease is manifested as a chronic diarrheal illness that is self-limiting in immunocompetent hosts and prolonged and often life-threatening in hosts with compromised immune systems. The lack of a suitable small animal model for screening anti-cryptosporidial drugs and for examining the pathogenicity and immunobiology of chronic cryptosporidosis was the impetus for this research effort. The objectives {{of the present study}} were three-fold: to characterize chronic Cryptosporidium parvum infections in dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice; evaluate the effects of Cryptosporidium parvum and dexamethasone on B and T lymphocyte proliferation; and determine the effects of the immunomodulator dehydroepiandrosterone on oocyst shedding intensities of mice infected with Cryptosporidium parvum Adult C 57 BL/ 6 N mice were immunosuppressed with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, then infected with Cryptosporidium parvum (106 oocysts/mouse) and investigated for their ability to sustain a four-month chronic infection. Dexamethasone was administered intraperitoneally (125 μ/mouse/day) or orally (8 μ/ml) in the drinking water ad libitum. Infection chronicity was characterized by evaluating mouse mortality, oocyst excretion in the feces, tissue distribution of the parasite, and the parasite-induced pathology. A progressive infection with Cryptosporidium parvum occurred in mice immunosuppressed intraperitoneally and orally as long as dexamethsone was administered. Mice receiving dexamethasone given intraperitoneally had a shorter prepatent period and a more consistent, although cyclic, oocyst shedding pattern when compared with mice given dexamethasone orally. Mice given dexamethasone orally exhibited a delayed prepatent period, with a steady increase in oocyst shedding. All mice receiving dexamethasone orally died within three months following oocyst inoculation. Clinical signs included dehydration, icterus, and reduction in spleen and body weights. Clinical signs were more abrupt in mice receiving oral dexamethasone. Parasite colonization involved the entire intestinal tract, including the pyloric ring and Peyer 2 ̆ 7 s patches, but was the <b>heaviest</b> in the <b>terminal</b> ileum. Parasites were present in the lungs, gallbladder, and pancreatic ducts. Pathologic abnormalities were isolated to the terminal small intestine and included blunting and fusion of intestinal villi and crypt hyperplasia. Cryptosporidium parvum and dexamethasone administered in vivo reduced B and T lymphocyte responses to the mitogens lipopolysaccharide and concanavalin A. Dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate resulted in no significant reductions in cryptosporidial activity as determined by oocyst shedding in the feces...|$|R
