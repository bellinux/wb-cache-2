2500|$|The area of {{the present-day}} city of Fredericton was first used for {{seasonal}} farming by the Maliseet peoples.

Objectives The prebiotic potential of poly-fructans extracted from native <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> tubers on the survivability of B. bifidum and E. coli was evaluated in this study. Methods In this experimental study, 24 treatments divided to 2 groups (Extracted poly-fructose from <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> tubers and standard inulin) randomly. The turbidity and pH variations during 48 hours incubation were determined using final concentrations {{of each group}} (0. 5 %, 1 %, 2 % and 3 % (w/v)). The data were analyzed by MINITAB 14 and MSTATC statistical software, one way ANOVA and Duncan’s test. Results This study suggests that <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> tuber fructooligosaccharides (JA-Fr) {{had the potential to}} be used as a prebiotic component. The growth of B. bifidum improved significantly in the presence of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> fructans compared to the control. There was no significant differences (P < 0. 05) in Bifidobacterium population in different concentrations of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> poly-fructans, but the population was significantly higher than the count in the presence of HP-inulin. The pH decreased in both media during 48 hours incubation time. Specific rate of growth and doubling time determined for E. coli demonstrated that the efficacy of various carbon sources in stimulating bacterial growth were influenced by the concentration and DP (degree of polymerization) of fructan chains in the media.
