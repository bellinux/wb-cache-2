An aviator jacket was made of supple leather and a knitted back panel, making it wearable both indoors and outdoors. Shoes sported heels made of rubber. Buttons were made of Brazil nuts.

5000|$|Reid {{was known}} for {{innovative}} and fashionable swimsuit designs and production.

Reid filed for a U.S. Patent in 1950 for a one-piece bathing suit using <b>elastic</b> <b>fabric</b> and that lacked buttons. Her company patented a machine for a fagotting stitch that became a hallmark of her designs. She had several other patents for swimsuits and accessories.|$|E
5000|$|I {{waited on}} him and took his order for these rowing trunks, {{to be made of}} a stitch like that of a cuff of a sweater so that they would stay up without a drawstring. After he tried them, he liked them so well that he came back for another pair {{and other members of the}} club heard about them, saw them and came in and ordered trunks like them. Nearly every member of the club who rowed had a pair. Later on, this same member came to me and asked if we could not make him a bathing suit of the same {{material}} .... a suit was made for him and he went to the ocean to bathe in the cold water. When he came back, he came into the store and told us that it was heavy and one could not swim well in it, but that he was well satisfied because it was so much warmer than any suit that he had ever had before and that it made ocean bathing a pleasure. ... this experience gave us the idea that a bathing suit made of this stitch, only in lighter weight, would be an excellent garment. We discussed this between ourselves and decided that we would order a needle bed for our sweater machine that would be fine enough to knit a rib-stitch bathing suit in a weight that would be comfortable. Roy, Carl, Joe Gerber and I were constantly in the water those days, either in the Y. M. C.

The RGG stresses the vasculature in a fashion similar to that experienced by the normally active man, hence preventing or limiting the development of post weightlessness orthostatic intolerance and related conditions. Four male, college age subjects received daily treatments with the RGG during a 15 day bedrest study. Four additional subjects also underwent the bedrest, but received no treatments; they served as controls.

The functional composite fabric, which {{was composed of}} self-made complex yarns with various twisting degrees and material composition, were created using a rotor twister and ring-spinning technique. The fabric structure was diversified by the feeding modes of weft yarn into a crochet-knitting machine.

40|$|Comfort {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors influencing the performance of apparel such as knitted elastic clothing, woven elastic shirts and elastic velvet fabrics. The compressive behavior of knitted <b>elastic</b> <b>fabric</b> affects the excellence in comfort. This study aimed to investigate the comfort of knitted <b>elastic</b> <b>fabric</b> based on compressive load. For this purpose, fabrics were produced with three different stitch densities (loop sizes), and compressive load tests were applied at three various penetration depths. According to these parameters, 9 fabric samples were prepared. Each sample was tested 30 times; therefore, the total number of examined cases was 270. The compressive load was measured using special designed tools, which were installed on the Instron tensile tester. The effects of penetration depth and loop size on compressive load were evaluated by using the CCD statistical model with four repeats of each experiment. The results indicate that the loop size and penetration depth have significant influence on the compressive load, which is modeled by a third order equation with R 2 of 0. 999 between applied model and experimental data. Consequently, the comfort could be predicted in terms of loop size and penetration depth. Utilizing this method can help apparel manufactures produce knitted elastic clothing with high comfort, according to the end use of garment...|$|E
