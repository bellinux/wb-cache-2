5|$|The Church of England itself {{contained}} three groups. Those {{who believed}} {{the form of}} the church was <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> should be included leaders like John Jewel and Richard Hooker. A second group looked for opportunities to reintroduce some Roman Catholic practices. Under the Stuart kings they would have their chance. The third group, who came to be called Puritans, wanted to remove remaining traces of the old ways. The Stuart kings were to give them a rough passage. At the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Church of England was firmly in place, but held the seeds of future conflict.|$|E

[...] Against a slow, heavy, start-and-stop bass riff and a constant drum thudding, Rollins closes [...] "Scream" [...] with a bellow after delivering the Ginn-penned lines: [...] "I may be a big baby/ But I'll scream in your ear/ 'Til I find out/ <b>Just</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is I am doing here".|$|E
500|$|The Chronicle {{mentions}} Ælle {{once more}} under the year 827, {{where he is}} listed as {{the first of the}} eight [...] "bretwaldas", or [...] "Britain-rulers". The list consists of Bede's original seven, plus Egbert of Wessex. [...] There has been much scholarly debate over <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant to be a [...] "bretwalda", and the extent of Ælle's actual power in southern England is an open question. [...] It is also noteworthy that there is a long gap between Ælle and the second king on Bede's list, Ceawlin of Wessex, whose reign began in the late 6th century; this may indicate a period in which Anglo-Saxon dominance was interrupted in some way.|$|E
500|$|Charlie Jane Anders of io9 {{believed}} that {{some elements of}} the film were deliberate self-references to Michael Bay's own sense of under-appreciation after the backlash to the second film: [...] "After {{a few hours of}} seeing Shia get dissed, overlooked and mistreated, the message becomes clear: Shia, as always, is a stand-in for Michael Bay. And Bay is showing us <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> felt like to deal with the ocean of Haterade—the snarking, the Razzie Award, the mean reviews—that Revenge of the Fallen unleashed." [...] She {{went on to say that}} the film's frequent, often jarring shifts in tone were an intentional endorsement of Michael Bay's own filmmaking style. [...] "Tone is for single-purpose machines. Consistency is for Decepticons. Michael Bay's ideal movie shifts from action movie to teen comedy to political drama with the same well-lubricated ease that his cars become men. By the time you've finished watching, you will speak Michael Bay's cinematic language." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Bounce" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Eric Diep of XXL praised Azalea's [...] "rapid-fire rhymes" [...] {{and said the}} track [...] "will certainly burn up the dance floor". Lucy O'Brien of The Quietus called the song [...] "irrepressible". AllMusic's David Jeffries opined that [...] "Bounce" [...] was [...] "simple and infectious", and [...] "does <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> says on the tin". Jeffries' view was shared by Mark Beaumont of NME who also deemed the song [...] "infectious", and Matt Jost of RapReviews.com who called it [...] "simply fun". Rory Cashin of Entertainment.ie described its production as [...] "overwhelmingly busy in a good way". In a State publication, Cashin deemed it a [...] "warped earworm" [...] and a [...] "belter". Rap-Up hailed it as Azalea's [...] "new anthem", and felt it was timed for the summer to [...] " [...] up the dancefloor". Similarly, Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly opined that the song was [...] "thumping" [...] and [...] "a thoroughbred entry in the song-of-summer race", while Juliana June Rasul of The Straits Times said it was [...] "a perfect summer pop song". In a publication for The Atlantic, Nolan Feeney highlighted it as a [...] "colorful butt-shaker". Idolator's Sam Lansky called the track a [...] "twerk anthem" [...] and considered it to be Azalea's most impressive and most commercial single.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{generally}} well received by critics, with several {{commenting on the}} honesty of the work. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Life offers much more than vicarious thrills. It captures the true spirit of rock and roll, the nitty-gritty {{of life on the}} road, and <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> feels like to be a heroin addict who doesn't know where his next fix is coming from. It also movingly captures Richards' extraordinary love of music—an even more powerful addiction for him than smack—and perhaps more surprisingly, his manifest destiny as a human being." [...] Jim Fusilli of the Wall Street Journal said that [...] "Mr. Richards writes with disarming introspection about his childhood, family and fame. And it's quite likely that no rock musician has ever written so keenly about the joys of making music. With a warm sense of humor and willingness to share his grief, Mr. Richards in [...] "Life" [...] defies almost every public perception about him." [...] In The Independent, John Walsh commented, [...] "He tells it with complete, reckless, disclosure. Sometimes it sounds like a man ranting into a tape machine; sometimes, in the tidier and more reflective sections, you can detect the hand of his co-writer, James (White Mischief) Fox. But the watchwords of this book are honesty, confessionalism, telling it straight." ...|$|E
500|$|One major {{breakthrough}} was {{the composition of}} the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] by songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez, which forced the production team to reconceptualize and rewrite Elsa as a far more complex, vulnerable, and sympathetic character. In The Daily Telegraphs words, instead of the villain envisioned by the producers, the songwriters saw Elsa as [...] "a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift." [...] Lee recalled: [...] "Bobby and Kristen said they were walking in Prospect Park and they just started talking about what would it feel like [...] Forget villain. <b>Just</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would feel like. And this concept of letting out who she is that she's kept to herself for so long and she's alone and free, but then the sadness of the fact [...] that the last moment is she's alone. It’s not a perfect thing, but it's powerful." [...] Del Vecho explained that [...] "Let It Go" [...] changed Elsa into a person [...] "ruled by fear and Anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive," [...] which in turn caused Lee to [...] "rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie. So that was when we really found the movie and who these characters were." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Rumors" [...] was {{originally}} titled [...] "Just What It Is". The track {{was written by}} Lohan, Cory Rooney, Taryll Jackson, and TJ Jackson. It was also produced by Rooney, who provided keyboards and background vocals. Peter Wade Keusch assisted the production, and was responsible along with Chris Avedon for Lohan's vocal recording, which occurred at the Poolhouse West and The Village Recorder in Los Angeles, California. Audio mixing was done by Keusch at Sony Music Studios in New York, New York. Christopher J. Warner provided the guitar present in the song's composition. It was released as a single on September 21, 2004, through Casablanca Records. [...] "Rumors" [...] is {{in the style of}} contemporary R. Lyrically, the song was written {{as a response to the}} paparazzi and media's backlash, both which are addressed in the chorus lines, where Lohan sings, [...] "I'm tired of rumors starting/ I'm sick of being followed/ I'm tired of people lying/ Saying what they want about me/ Why can't they back up off me?/ Why can't they let me live? I'm going to do it my way/ Take this for <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is." [...] Spence D. of IGN noted that the singer's vocals are [...] "driven by snarls, breathy croons, and emotionally restrained angst," [...] while John Murphy of musicOMH considered it [...] "a feisty dance anthem with intelligent lyrics attacking the paparazzi and press in general." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Christian Post on April 21, 2013, Osteen expressed his sentiments on being perceived as {{being part of the}} prosperity gospel.

I think prosperity, and I've said it 1,000 times, it's being healthy, it's having great children, it's having peace of mind. Money is part of it; and yes, I believe God wants us to excel ... to be blessed so we can be a bigger blessing to others. I feel very rewarded. I wrote a book and sold millions of copies; and Victoria and I were able to help more people than we ever dreamed of.

Justin Chang of Variety praised the performance of Stewart by saying, [...] "No longer a mopey, lower-lip-biting emo girl, this Bella is twitchy, feral, formidable and fully energized, a goddess even among her exalted bloodsucker brethren". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, [...] "Despite the slow start Mr. Condon closes the series in fine, smooth style.

He understood that the universe doesn't care about our existence or welfare and he epitomized the realization that our lives have meaning {{only to the extent that}} we give them meaning." [...] Bill Maher paid tribute to Hitchens on his show Real Time with Bill Maher, saying, [...] "We lost a hero of mine, a friend, and one of the great talk show guests of all time." [...] Salman Rushdie and English comedian Stephen Fry paid tribute at the Christopher Hitchens Vanity Fair Memorial 2012. Three weeks before Hitchens's death, George Eaton of the New Statesman wrote, [...] "He is determined to ensure that he is not remembered simply as a 'lefty who turned right' or as a contrarian and provocateur. Throughout his career, he has retained a commitment to the Enlightenment values of reason, secularism and pluralism. His targets—Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, God—are chosen not at random, but rather because they have offended one or more of these principles. The tragedy of Hitchens' illness is that it came at a time when he enjoyed a larger audience than ever. The great polemicist is certain to be remembered, but, as he is increasingly aware, perhaps not as he would like."
