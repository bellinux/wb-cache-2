40|$|The {{effect of}} {{localised}} phosphorus (P) <b>fertiliser</b> <b>placement</b> and in particular, deep P <b>fertiliser</b> <b>placement,</b> on the comparative root growth and P uptake of fibrous vs tap-rooted crops is not known. In this study, {{we examined the}} root growth and P uptake of wheat (Triticum aestivum L), canola (Brassica napus L), and narrow-leaf lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L) in a split-root system and in columns with deep (19 cm) or shallow (5 cm) P fertiliser sources in glasshouse conditions. In the split-root system, plants of all three species grown under heterogeneous soil P conditions absorbed more P and produced greater root and shoot biomass than those under homogeneous P supply. Root plasticity differed between species under heterogeneous soil P supply: canola and wheat allocated relatively more root biomass and root length to the high P zone than narrow-leaf lupin. In the column experiment, {{there was no difference}} in the amount of P accumulated in shoots of any crops grown in the deep vs shallow P fertiliser treatments. Root proliferation occurred within the shallow and deep-P fertiliser bands in all three species; however, root distribution above or below the bands did not differ between deep or shallow P fertiliser treatments in any species. Whilst root plasticity responses to heterogeneous soil P supply differed among species, root architecture (fibrous vs taproot) did not confer any advantage or disadvantage to the acquisition of P from deep vs shallow P fertiliser bands. Moreover, whilst roots proliferate in the vicinity of P fertiliser bands, root distribution outside of the bands appears to remain unaltered in both fibrous and tap-rooted crops during early growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to evaluate soil and climatic factors affecting crop P uptake and yield when P was placed at different soil depths using APSIM. Nutrient stratification, particularly soil immobile nutrients such as phosphorus (P), could {{have a significant impact on}} availability of nutrients to crops, as soil immobile nutrient availability, root growth and root activity in the surface layer are more vulnerable to drought than those in sub-surface layers. Placing P fertiliser deeper in the soil was demonstrated in the early field studies to improve crop P uptake and yield in a water-limited environment of Western Australia (Jarvis and Bolland 1990).

40|$|When {{the bulk}} of {{phosphorus}} (P) is located near the soil surface, spring drying of topsoil in Mediterranean-type climates can reduce P availability to crops and cause potential yield loss. In crop species that require a P supply during spring, deep-placement of P fertiliser has proved an effective method of improving P availability and grain yields; however, the spring P demand of field-grown canola (Brassica napus L.) and therefore potential response to deep P placement is not known. This study investigated the effect of deep- (0. 170. 18 m), conventional- (shallow, 0. 070. 08 m), split- (50 % deep, 50 % shallow), and nil-P fertiliser treatments on P accumulation and seed yields of canola in two field trials. In addition, a glasshouse experiment with different depths of P <b>fertiliser</b> <b>placement</b> and topsoil drying at different growth stages was conducted. In the glasshouse study, deep P placement resulted in greater P uptake by plants, but did not increase seed yields regardless {{of the time of}} topsoil drying. At the relatively high-soil-P field site (canola grown on residual P application from the previous year) in a dry season, there was no biomass response to any residual P fertiliser treatments, and P accumulation had ceased by mid flowering. At the low-P field site, P accumulation continued throughout flowering and silique-filling, and seed yields increased significantly (P≤ 0. 05) in the order of split- > deep- > shallow- > nil-P treatments. Improved seed yields in the split- and deep-P treatments appeared to be the direct result of enhanced P availability; in particular, P uptake during vegetative growth (winter) was higher in the treatments with deep P placement. A greater understanding of P accumulation by field-grown canola in relation to soil P properties is needed for better defining optimum P <b>fertiliser</b> <b>placement</b> recommendations...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{acidification}} is {{a widespread}} degradation problem, but little information is available for oil palm production systems. The aim of this work {{was to determine the}} effect of <b>fertiliser</b> type and <b>placement</b> on acidification of volcanic ash soils under oil palm in Papua New Guinea. A field trial, which had various combinations of N (114 - 120 kg N/(ha. year)) and K (329 kg K/(ha. year)) fertilisers applied over 13 years, was examined. Over that period, pHwater of the 0 - 0. 2 m layer declined by 0. 38 units in the control treatment and 0. 52 - 0. 96 units in the fertilised treatments. Application of fertiliser and plant residues are not uniform in oil palm plantations, so the effect of placement was measured in another trial, which had been operating for 6 years. In the 0 - 0. 05 m layer, the decrease in pHwater due to fertiliser addition (ammonium chloride plus kieserite) was least (0. 52 units) when fertiliser was applied in the weeded circle and greatest (1. 03 units) when it was applied in the frond pile. Soil pH buffer capacity was different between zones and fertiliser treatments, but the difference in acidification effect of fertiliser between zones was attributed primarily to differences in the water balance and N cycling rather than pH buffer capacity...|$|R

40|$|Recent studies report low and {{variable}} phosphorus (P) fertiliser use efficiency (PUE) for cotton {{in the northern}} grains region (NGR) of eastern Australia. This {{may be due to}} cotton accessing P pools that are not currently tested for in the subsoil (10 – 30 cm) or variation in response to P source and placement strategy. Two glasshouse studies were used to investigate this, incorporating two soil P tests to assess readily and slowly available P pools (Colwell, and a dilute acid colloquially referred to as the BSES extractant), and five different P <b>fertiliser</b> <b>placement</b> strategies in the subsoil. Eighteen Vertosols were collected across southern to central Queensland in the NGR, and then used to grow faba bean (Vicia faba L.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) sequentially in the same 28 -L pot. Readily available P pools assessed by Colwell-P were of major importance for faba bean and cotton dry matter, as well as for tissue P concentrations. Cotton was less responsive to extractable subsoil P concentrations than faba bean, suggesting either greater internal PUE or improved ability to accumulate P under conditions of limited availability. We recommend that subsoil P fertilisation should occur before sowing faba bean to maximise PUE in a cotton–faba bean rotation. Faba bean and cotton both recovered more P when the subsoil was fertilised, but no individual P <b>fertiliser</b> <b>placement</b> strategy was superior. Phosphorus extracted using the BSES method was not correlated with faba bean or cotton dry matter or tissue P concentration over the single crop cycle. We also recommend that Colwell-P be measured in the topsoil and subsoil to understand the quantity of plant-available P in Vertosols of the NGR, and that {{further research is needed to}} describe the resupply of the readily available P pool from slowly available P pools during a single crop cycle.

Three different precision <b>fertiliser</b> <b>placement</b> techniques are compared for this purpose: starter, band or side-injected fertiliser. The use of each of these methods consistently produced the same (or greater) yields at lower application rates than those from conventional broadcast applications, increasing the apparent recovery of N, P and K, and the overall efficiency of nutrient use, while reducing the levels of residual nutrients in the soil.

40|$|Australian {{cropping}} systems {{are dominated by}} winter cereals; however, grain legumes, oilseeds and summer cereals {{play an important role}} as break crops. Inputs of phosphorus (P) fertiliser account for a significant proportion of farm expenditure on crop nutrition, so effective fertiliser-use guidelines are essential. A national database (BFDC National Database) of field experiments examining yield responses to P fertiliser application has been established. This paper reports the results of interrogating that database using a web application (BFDC Interrogator) to develop calibration relationships between soil P test (0 - 10 cm depth; Colwell NaHCO 3 extraction) and relative grain yield.

40|$|Inter-row hoeing {{is known}} to control tap-rooted and erect weed species more {{effectively}} in winter wheat than weed harrowing. However, {{little is known about}} its effectiveness for use in the spring in winter wheat grown at wide row spacing (240 mm) under the influence of different placement of fertiliser. Two field experiments, one in 1999 and one in 2000, were conducted to study the influence of <b>fertiliser</b> <b>placement,</b> timing of inter-row hoeing, and driving speed on the weeding effect on different weed species and crop growth. Placement of fertiliser below the soil surface improved crop growth and grain yield in both years compared with placement on the surface, but weeds surviving hoeing were not more suppressed by the improved crop growth. Timing was not important in the one experiment, whereas hoeing twice with beginning in early April was most effective in the other experiment where weed growth over the winter had been vigorously. Driving speed had no influence on either the weeding effect or the yield, except for one case where increasing speed reduced the effect against well-developed weeds. As compared to non-weeded reference treatments, inter-row hoeing reduced total weed biomass by 60 - 70 % and tap-rooted and erect weed species in particular by 50 - 90 %. Sowing at 240 mm row spacing yielded less than 120 mm (Danish standard), and inter-row hoeing for winter wheat needs to be adapted to narrower row spacing to avoid such yield declines...|$|E
40|$|Alkaline {{calcareous}} or sodic soils {{represent an}} important {{proportion of the}} world’s arable soils and are important for cereal production. For calcareous soils in general, despite high applications of P fertiliser for many years, P deficiency in cereals is common. Field experiments were conducted to test the relative ability of granular (e. g. DAP, MAP and TSP) and fluid fertilisers to supply P to wheat on grey calcareous and red brown calcareous sandy loam soils (Calcixerollic xerochrepts). A pot experiment was also conducted with these soils and with two noncalcareous alkaline soils to investigate the effects of placement on the efficiency of fertiliser performance. In 1998, fluid and granular sources of P, N and Zn were compared in the field by banding below the seed at sowing. In 1999, MAP applied as granular, and technical grade MAP applied as fluid, were compared as sources of P in rate response experiments. First year results showed that fluid sources of P, N and Zn produced significantly more grain than the granular product. In the following year, fluid fertilisers were found to produce significantly higher response curves for shoot dry weight, grain yield and P uptake in grain. At a commercial rate of 8 kg P ha− 1, fluid fertiliser produced between 22 % and 27 % more grain than the granular product.

40|$|Increasing {{concerns}} about pesticide use and a steadily increasing conversion to organic farming have been major factors driving research in physical and cultural weed control methods in Europe. This paper reviews {{some of the}} major results achieved with non-chemical methods and strategies especially adapted for row crops (e. g. corn, sugar beet, onion, leek, and carrot) and small grain cereals (e. g. barley and wheat). In row crops, intra-row weeds constitute a major challenge and research has mainly aimed at replacing laborious hand weeding with mechanization. A number of investigations have focussed on optimising the use of thermal and mechanical weeding methods against intra-row weeds, such as flaming, harrowing, brush weeding, hoeing, torsion weeding and finger weeding. And new methods are now under investigation such as robotic weeding for row crops with abundant spacing between individual plants and band-steaming for row crops developing dense crop stands. The strategic use of mechanical weed control methods in small grain cereals has been another area of considerable interest. Weed harrowing and inter-row hoeing provide promising results when {{they are part of a}} strategy that also involves cultural methods such as <b>fertiliser</b> <b>placement,</b> variety choice, crop seed vigour, and crop seeding rate. Positive interactions between preventive and cultural factors and direct physical methods have been less pronounced in row crops. Although research in preventive, cultural, and physical methods have improved weed control in row crops and small grain cereals, effective long-term weed management in low-external input and organic systems can only be achieved by tackling the problem in a wider context, i. e. at the cropping system level. Basic principles of this approach, examples of cover crop and intercropping use for weed suppression, and an application in a two-year rotation are presented and discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Hedgerows of the {{fodder tree}} legume Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit ssp. glabrata (Rose Zárate) (leucaena) planted with {{companion}} grass (leucaena-grass pasture) form a productive, profitable and sustainable tropical pasture in northern Australia. Leucaena is {{renowned for its}} longevity (> 30 years) and productivity under regular grazing, {{and this is a}} key factor in its profitability. To-date graziers and researchers have not been concerned about the sustainability of commercial leucaena-grass pastures, which are rarely fertilized. However, nutrient depletion could be expected after many years of nutrient removal under heavy grazing without replenishment, even on soils of moderate initial fertility. This study investigated the long-term productivity of leucaena-grass pastures in relation to nutrient depletion in Queensland. Experimental trials were conducted at 3 research stations and 6 commercial cattle properties. Prior to conducting field trials, a postal survey of leucaena growers ascertained perceived changes in leucaena, grass and livestock productivity over time. Physical and management factors influencing long-term pasture productivity were also explored. Graziers reported that leucaena productivity had declined in 58 % of aging pastures. Lower livestock productivity was associated with declining leucaena growth, even though grass growth remained vigorous. Leucaena growth decline was more frequent on soil types of marginal initial fertility. Maintenance fertilizer was not applied to most (98 %) leucaena pastures surveyed despite significant amounts of nutrient removal, particularly phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S), occurring over prolonged periods of moderate to high grazing pressure. It was predicted that under current management practices large areas of commercial leucaena pasture will be affected by soil nutrient depletion over the next 10 years. The effect of age of leucaena plants on pasture productivity was investigated in pastures aged from 8 to 38 years. Leucaena growth, expressed as rainfall use efficiency (RUE), declined with age (from 4. 0 to 1. 9 kg total dry matter (DM) /ha/mm), as did leaf nitrogen (N), P and S concentrations. Leucaena productivity decline was attributed to P and S deficiency restricting growth and symbiotic dinitrogen (N 2) fixation. Composition of interrow grass changed from native grass dominance before leucaena establishment to green panic (Panicum maximum var. trichoglume) dominance in the aging leucaena pastures, particularly adjacent to leucaena hedgerows. This was attributed to increased soil Navailability. Leucaena and grass roots were concentrated in the topsoil; however, leucaena roots did extend beyond 1 m depth while grass roots did not. Changes in topsoil organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) resulting from the planting of leucaena hedgerows into native grass pastures and previously cropped soils were studied. Topsoil OC and TN contents increased significantly under leucaena pasture (OC from 81 - 290 kg/ha/year and TN from 12 - 24 kg/ha/yr). Since TN and OC showed similar trends, there was no significant effect on carbon:N ratios. Leucaena contributed to soil OC both directly via plant part decomposition, and indirectly, via enhanced grass growth in the inter-row. Lower topsoil OC accumulation rates (81 kg/ha/yr) were observed in the older leucaena-grass pastures related to the decline in yield and vigour of leucaena in these aging pastures. The amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 -e) accumulated in soil OC in productive leucaena-grass pasture was estimated to be higher than the amount of CO 2 -e emitted in methane from beef production from these pastures, thus positively impacting on their greenhouse gas balance. Leucaena responses to P and/or S applications were evaluated in a 30 year-old leucaenagrass pasture. Leucaena RUE and symbiotic N 2 fixation were restricted by S deficiency. Sulfur concentration in leaf tissue and high N:S ratio were useful indicators of S deficiency. Although leucaena growth and its nutritional status were little affected by P application, symbiotic N 2 fixation did respond significantly to P application. Leucaena and grass responses to fertiliser applications were further evaluated at a variety of soil types and environments on 8 sites in Queensland. Increased leucaena RUE (from 3. 1 to 4. 6 kg total DM/ha/mm) and enhanced nutritional status at most sites showed that leucaena plants were restricted by P and/or S deficiency. The major factors contributing to the P and S deficiencies were: a) inherent low soil P and/or S fertility, b) nutrient removal by cropping and grazing, c) shallow soils, d) acid soils, and e) grass competition for available water and nutrients. Inter-row cultivation (with or without fertiliser) had little effect on leucaena growth but significantly increased grass RUE (from 4. 7 to 7. 0 kg total DM/ha/mm) at some sites probably due to enhanced mineralization of N. Leaf P and S concentrations were not reliable indicators of deficiencies of these nutrients, possibly due to inadequate leaf sampling conditions. The effects of ambient temperature, water stress and phenological development of plant on nutrient concentrations in leucaena leaf was investigated to determine whether leaf tissueanalysis can reliably predict nutrient deficiencies. The youngest fully expanded leaf (YFEL) was established as the most appropriate leaf tissue for predicting nutritional status of leucaena plants since the YFEL: (a) was an easily identifiable tissue in which nutrient shifts were at a minimum; (b) provided information for readily mobile (N, P and potassium) and variably mobile (S, copper and zinc) nutrients, thus simplifying leaf collection; and (c) facilitated comparison of data from leaves of similar physiological age in different growing conditions and sites. Nutrient concentrations in YFEL were significantly influenced by water stress and phenological stage of plant development (particularly flowering and pod filling) through the mechanism of rate of leaf appearance. Chronological age of the YFEL, an indicator of leaf appearance, varied from 12 to > 70 days depending upon plant phenological stage, being > 140 days under prolonged water stress. It was found that nutrient concentrations in leucaena YFEL can only be interpreted against critical concentrations if plants are actively growing (October-April) in a vegetative stage and YFEL are 0. 7 % DM should be discarded as {{they are likely to be}} too old (> 20 days). The research program has identified that leucaena established on non-alluvial soils need to be provided with regular maintenance P and S fertiliser to promote symbiotic N 2 fixation and to maintain high RUE. At present, many leucaena pastures are likely to be suffering undiagnosed nutrient deficiencies that will be limiting pasture and animal productivity and enterprise profitability. Youngest fully expanded leaf analysis can be used as a predictive tool to diagnose nutrient deficiencies provided the recommended protocol is followed. Further investigation is required to: a) assess the duration of responses to applied fertiliser to determine frequency of application; b) investigate the rate of maintenance fertiliser P and S that has to be applied to maintain leucaena symbiotic N 2 fixation and RUE at a desired level to benefit both forage quality and quantity, and soil fertility; c) study methods of <b>fertiliser</b> <b>placement</b> for adequate and timely supply of nutrients, particularly P, to leucaena roots; and d) confirm the use of Ca concentration in YFEL as a predictor of optimum leaf age for the range of soils and areas where leucaena is grown...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Ferrosols of the South Burnett {{region were}} {{considered}} to be good soils {{in the early days of}} agriculture. Continuous cropping of these soils has resulted in a reduction in their chemical and physical fertility. One aspect of this reduction has been the decline in K status, especially in the subsoil. The change to conservation tillage has accentuated nutrient stratification giving high nutrient concentrations in soil surface layers (0 - 10 cm) and lower concentrations in the subsoil (20 - 40 cm). The stratification could be attributed to the lack of mixing of surface applied fertilisers, the annual return of crop residue to the soil surface, and the cycling of nutrients from deep soil layers to shallow layers through nutrient uptake by plant roots. Dry periods during the summer cropping season are common due to the highly variable, summer-dominant rainfall pattern of the South Burnett. As the topsoil dries out, crops will forage for moisture and nutrients from lower in the soil profile where K reserves are smaller. The combination of dry periods and stratified K reserves has resulted in an increasing incidence of K deficiency symptoms in summer crops. The objective of this research was to investigate K application strategies for conservation tillage farming to improve profile K distribution in the South Burnett region in order to overcome the negative K balance and the crop K deficiencies associated with the stratified profile and dry weather. To meet these objectives requires the application of K in bands. Published studies have shown that for soils that have stratified nutrients, if the soil K is low, especially in the subsoil, and dry conditions have existed over the growth period, then there is a significant increase in crop yield with subsoil banding of fertiliser over broadcast <b>fertiliser</b> <b>placement.</b> There are a number of issues that needed to be investigated to determine the optimum method for applying fertiliser K in a band. When banding immobile nutrients such as K there is the potential for there being insufficient root volume in contact with the fertiliser for optimum plant uptake. There are a number of options available to overcome this potential problem. The first would be to take advantage of root proliferation, a plant’s natural response to a heterogeneous supply of nutrients. A significant increase in root length density is promoted by concentrated zones of K in this soil when the ratio of the K concentrations in the fertilised zone to the K concentration in the unfertilised zone is greater than 9 (Chapter 6 and Chapter 7). However, this root proliferation is not to the extent that would be expected with N and P, and it can not be stated with certainty that it is K promoting root proliferation, and that this is not a form of secondary promotion such as where the concentrated K is resulting in a concentrated zone of N in the form of NH 4 +. The results also show that root proliferation does not appear to be promoted when the ratio is equal to or less than 4. 5 (Chapter 3). Another option is to add N and/or P in a fertiliser band with K to promote root proliferation. Combinations of these nutrients applied together in a band in the Ferrosol soil of the South Burnett will remain in the position of application (Chapter 5), ensuring the maximum potential from root proliferation could be achieved. There were concerns regarding the toxic effects that can occur when blending high concentrations of different nutrients together. However, there were no adverse effects on root access and root absorption from concentrated fertiliser blends containing K, N and P (Chapter 4). The addition of N and/or P in a fertiliser band will promote root proliferation over having K only in the fertiliser band (Chapter 6). However, this increased root volume in contact with the K fertiliser did not result in an increased absorption of K from the fertiliser band by the plants. Although plant tissue K was below adequate concentrations, mass balance calculations of K showed that there was sufficient applied fertiliser K for adequate plant tissue K concentrations to be reached. Modelling indicated that under the initial conditions and the conditions prevalent at 45 DAS, the plants would have been able to absorb sufficient K for plant tissue K concentrations to be above adequate levels. The most likely reasoning for the insufficient plant uptake of K was soil K was rendered unavailable to the plant. What happened to the original K which was initially plant available can not be confirmed conclusively. It was hypothesised that over the growth period there was fixation of K by the soil, due to the high concentration of K in the fertiliser band (movement of K into ‘fixed’ pools in the soil), resulting in reduced levels of plant available K. Root volume in contact with fertiliser can be increased by increasing the soil volume fertilised, although this would reduce the concentration of the nutrient and reduce the potential for root proliferation. This concept was explored with a pot trial that exposed plants to different volumes of soil fertilised with the same quantity of K fertiliser (Chapter 7). The volume of soil fertilised has no effect on the cumulative plant uptake of K up to 70 days after sowing. It was concluded that this occurred as a result of the increased root length density in concentrated K zones (root proliferation, although not to the extent that would be expected with N and P), and physiological plasticity (increased plant uptake rate). When 25 % or more of the soil volume contains the fertiliser K there was sufficient root volume in contact with the fertiliser to permit uptake and therefore no need for root proliferation. Where smaller soil volumes were fertilised; root length density increased in the vicinity of the fertiliser to the point where sufficient root volume was in contact with the fertiliser. When small soil volumes are fertilised with K, such as in a band, there is also an increase in root length density in the vicinity of the fertiliser, but not to the extent required for adequate plant uptake of K. In this situation it appears that there is physiological plasticity (increased plant uptake rate of K) to make up the shortfall. When only a small proportion of the soil is fertilised, such as in a band, the volume of soil in contact with the K fertiliser is minimised and, consequently the quantity of K that can be fixed by the soil is reduced. This results in a higher concentration of plant available soil K, in the soil solution and as exchangeable K. This greater plant available K is able to buffer increased uptake rates that occur to compensate for the small volumes of soil containingK fertiliser, and the resultant lack of root volume in contact with the K fertiliser. However, this increased uptake rate on its own is insufficient for adequate K uptake, requiring root proliferation to increase the root volume in contact with the K fertiliser to a point where the combined plasticity is sufficient to ensure adequate plant uptake of K...|$|E
