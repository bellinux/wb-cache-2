2500|$|There is {{no better}} {{illustration}} of the dilemmas of rational policy making in America than {{in the field of}} health…the first obstacle to rationalism is defining the problem. Is our goal to have good health — that <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> live at all (infant mortality), how well we live (days lost to sickness), and how long we live (life spans and adult mortality)? Or is our goal to have good medical care — frequent visits to the doctor, wellequipped and accessible hospitals, and equal access to medical care by rich and poor alike? ...|$|E
2500|$|People tend {{to believe}} as {{dictated}} by their own emotions, projections, and transferences. ... Our judgment should really be guided by what the protagonists never tired of asserting themselves: {{that there was no}} sex. In the final analysis the question <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> believe their testimony or not. I choose to believe them, and not out of prudery, but because in those days people saw premarital sexual relations, especially as applies to Spielrein, differently than we do today; moreover, because unconsummated sexual desire was even more poignant and more romantic than consummated sex. However, the sexual myth dies hard, providing sensational material for a number of theatrical productions and a plethora of articles in the popular press and professional journals.|$|E
2500|$|Taste can be {{objective}} {{in terms of}} the five tastes (sweet, salt, sour, bitter, and savory) {{but it can also be}} subjective in terms of what we deem [...] "good" [...] and [...] "bad." [...] Taste is [...] "subjective, objective, and qualitative". In terms of it being a philosophical concept, taste is hard to define because it is essentially subjective when pertaining to the personal preferences of individuals i.e. [...] "'de gustibus non est disputandum' (there is no disputing taste)". We cannot tell someone they do not think something tastes good because we do not agree, and vice versa. In order to evaluate taste in this context, we must explore all the ways in which taste can be defined. According to Alan Weiss, taste fulfills the purpose of six functions: taste is the tool in which we use to define flavor; it is also flavor and how we categorize flavor (sweet or salty); it is the preference, we as the tastemakers, place on specific flavors and our demand for those flavors; it <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> choose to like or dislike a certain taste and therefore allow it into our general society of acceptable tastes or exile it; it is the value in which we place on certain taste (one might believe one's taste in Bach or Rothko earns one capital); and lastly, with good judgement comes good taste and therefore, one with expressively good taste are expected to have good judgement, just as those in bad taste are expected to be in bad judgement ...|$|E

2500|$|Ellison, one of {{only two}} African-American state lawmakers at the time (the other being Rep. Neva Walker of District 61B), became the {{spokesman}} of the DFL group that filed with the Ethics Committee against Lindner. Besides Ellison the group consisted of Representatives Karen Clark, Frank Hornstein (whose mother is a Holocaust survivor), Margaret Anderson Kelliher, Neva Walker, Lyndon Carlson, Ron Latz, and House Minority Leader Matt Entenza. The complaint held “that when Lindner expressed his belief that homosexuals may not have been persecuted during the Nazi Holocaust, his conduct violated ‘accepted norms of House behavior’ and that his comments ‘bring the House into dishonor or disrepute.’” Ellison stated that they sought “censure of Lindner and his removal as chair of the Economic Development and Tourism Division of the House Commerce, Jobs, and Economic Development Policy Committee.” Ellison’s group exhibited letters from out-of-state residents who said they cancelled vacation plans in Minnesota after learning of Lindner's comments. Ellison stated “There’s a question mark hanging over the State Office Building. The question is ‘Do {{the people of the state}} of Minnesota and the legislators that represent them share the viewpoint that people who were victims of Nazi persecution were in fact not victims of Nazi persecution?’ Mr. Lindner has insulted not only the House but members of the community at large.” [...] The Session Weekly reported “‘The fact of the matter is his conduct calls for discipline,’ said Ellison, who added that a censure penalty does not prohibit Lindner from saying what he believes. ‘It would just be a denunciation, a condemnation, of what he said.’” Ellison told Minnesota Public Radio [...] "That question mark sitting over this building <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> represent all the people of this state or not. And whether or not an elected official, a person who holds an election certificate can spout bigoted language, mean-spirited, untrue statements designed to injure members of the community and members of this body. That is the issue." ...|$|E
