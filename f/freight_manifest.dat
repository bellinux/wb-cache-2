5000|$|The story {{comes to}} a head with a {{confrontation}} between Hirth, the last fugitive and absent-without-leave Canadian soldier Andy Brock (Raymond Massey) on a baggage and express car of a Canadian National Railway train near the American border. When Hirth learns that the train has crossed into the United States at Niagara Falls, he surrenders his gun to a customs official and demands {{to be taken to}} the German embassy in the U.S. Brock explains that Hirth is wanted in Canada for murder but while the U.S. border guards are sympathetic to Brock's plea, they cannot find any official reason to send Hirth back to Canada. Brock then points out that Hirth is locked in the express freight compartment of the baggage car but not listed on the <b>freight</b> <b>manifest.</b> The U.S. guards are happy to accept this pretext and send the car, along with Hirth and Brock, back to Canada as [...] "improperly manifested cargo". The film ends with the train reversing to Canada and Brock about to pummel Hirth in the boxcar.|$|E

50|$|Eirich later {{reported}} that the robbers were informed and knew all about the safety systems in the vault, including the double-door system, whereby one door must be shut {{in order for the}} other one to be opened without activating the alarm. The robbers ordered Eirich to open up the first door to a 10-by-20-foot room. They knew that, if he opened the second door, he would activate an alarm to the Port Authority Police unit at the airport. Once inside, they ordered Eirich to lie on the ground and began sifting through invoices and <b>freight</b> <b>manifests</b> to determine which parcels they wanted from among the many similarly wrapped ones.|$|R
50|$|The Pittsburgh Line {{is marked}} with three major freight {{terminals}} on both of its ends. On its east end, Harrisburg Terminal handles a bulk of the railroads intermodal traffic, with a handful intermodal trains originating and terminating there. Across the Susquehanna River in Enola is Norfolk Southern’s major freight terminal in the Greater Harrisburg area; Enola Yard, which handles almost all <b>manifest</b> <b>freight</b> traffic that passes through the area. Many of the Pittsburgh Line’s <b>manifest</b> <b>freight</b> trains originate or terminate here, with a few continuing south to Baltimore, Maryland and points east, while others bypass Enola and cross the Rockville Bridge over the Susquehanna to Harrisburg bound for Allentown, Pennsylvania and points east.|$|R
50|$|Norfolk & Western used 2156 and {{the other}} Y6-class {{locomotives}} primarily for slower, heavy freight trains in the more mountainous districts. Although they were used throughout the N&W, their primary work occurred on the Pocahontas, Radford, and Shenandoah Divisions. They mostly hauled <b>manifest</b> <b>freight</b> and coal trains.|$|R

Immediately behind the locomotive are cars painted in the old Burlington Northern livery.|$|R
2500|$|Boston Sand and Gravel has an {{agreement}} with Pan Am to operate its shortline New Hampshire Northcoast Railroad trains from Ossipee, New Hampshire to just north of Boston's North Station to supply aggregates to its plant on the Boston/Cambridge border. [...] An occasional move occurs with run-through power from Norfolk Southern Railway to supply coal to a power plant in Bow, New Hampshire, over the Fitchburg Line. The Haverhill and Fitchburg lines also host four to six PAR <b>manifest</b> <b>freight</b> trains per day.|$|R
40|$|Although much {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} the growth of intermodal traffic over the past decade, <b>manifest</b> <b>freight</b> or carload traffic is a major revenue generator for railroads. In 2004, the top four commodity categories in terms of revenue per carload averaged $ 2, 971 per carload compared to an average of $ 770 for intermodal carloads. The high potential profitability of carload traffic suggests that railroads should try to further grow this segment of traffic, especially in an era of limited railway capacity. To do this, they must meet the increasing logistical needs of their customers by providing more consistent, reliable service than has previously been the case for carload traffic. The classification terminal is a key determinant in the service reliability of <b>manifest</b> <b>freight.</b> Terminal performance also impacts network efficiency. A regression analysis for six Class I railroads showed a statistically significant relationship between average system-wide terminal dwell and average manifest train speed. As average dwell time increased, average manifest train speed decreased. The R 2 values ranged from 20. 7 % to 34. 7 %. With demand for rail transportation service expected to continue to grow, increasing network efficiency will be vital to reliably handle the traffic...|$|R
50|$|The ex-New York Central's River Subdivision {{follows the}} west bank of the Hudson River through Stony Point. The line is now {{operated}} by CSX Transportation, the fourth railroad to operate the line. The only company served by CSX in the town is the Mirant Lovett Generating Station which receives trainloads of coal about once a week. The power station owns and operates its own railroad to bring the coal from the siding at milepost (MP) 38 into the plant. A talking defect detector, which scans the axles of passing trains for problems, is located in Stony Point. On average, between 20-25 trains pass through Stony Point per day. CSX runs six container stack trains a day. Once a week a garbage train from the Bronx brings trash up north to burn for power. On a normal day on the River Line one will see mostly <b>manifest</b> <b>freight</b> trains and tankers. The Auto Rack express brings cars to its owner in either New Jersey or northern New York. CSX trains run 5 to 15 minutes apart. The longest wait is mostly an hour. There are only two trestles in Stony Point.|$|R
