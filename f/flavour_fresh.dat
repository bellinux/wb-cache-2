50|$|Shanklish varies {{greatly in}} its texture and <b>flavour.</b> <b>Fresh</b> cheeses have a soft texture and mild flavour; those dried and aged {{for a longer}} period become {{progressively}} harder and can acquire an extremely pungent odour and flavour. To make spicier cheeses, spices such as aniseed and chilli can be mixed in before the cheese is formed into balls. Spicy shanklish are often covered in chilli, especially in Syria, thus appear red. Shanklish from the Syrian coastal plain around Tartus and the adjoining northern Lebanese region of Akkar are considered particularly delectable; these tend to be hard, with a clean strong flavour and near-white colour.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- The sensory, {{physical}} and chemical characteristics of ‘Douradão ’ peaches cold stored in different modified atmosphere packaging (LDPE bags of 30, 50, 60, 75 µm thickness) were studied. After 14, 21 and 28 days of cold storage (1 ± 1 °C and 90 ± 5 % RH), samples were withdrawn from MAP and kept during 4 days in ambient air for ripening. Descriptive terminology and sensory profile of the peaches were developed by methodology based on the Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA). The assessors consensually defined the sensory descriptors, their respective reference materials and the descriptive evaluation ballot. Fourteen individuals were selected as judges based on their discrimination capacity and reproducibility. Seven descriptors were generated showing similarities and differences among the samples. The data were analysed by ANOVA, Tukey test and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The atmospheres that developed inside the different packaging materials during cold storage differed significantly. The PCA showed that MA 50 and MA 60 treatments were more characterized by the fresh peach <b>flavour,</b> <b>fresh</b> appearance, juiciness and flesh firmness, and were effective for keeping good quality of ‘Douradão ’ peaches during 28 d of cold storage.

40|$|This thesis {{researched}} {{the best possible}} operating conditions of a test dryer and the mild drying technique for preserving fresh tomato <b>flavour.</b> <b>Fresh</b> flavour is the one with more green notes and less heat-induced notes. Three different type of test dryers, namely a convective dryer (Heat Pump Dehumidifier, HPD), a conduction and infra-red radiation dryer (Refractance Window Dryer, RWD), and a microwave radiation dryer (Microwave Vacuum Dryer, MWVD) were chosen {{as a representative of}} differing principles of heat transfer. Control dryers based on commercial tomato products were also chosen, the freeze dryer (FD), spray dryer (SPD) as a basis for comparison of the flavour quality. A thin layer model was developed to predict the drying behaviour of tomato pulp and energy modelling was used with the RWD. For the RWD, conduction and evaporation were proved to be the dominant mechanisms of heat gain and heat loss from the product, respectively. The radiation effect was found to be negligible, so disproving the concept of RWD. With the HPD, a preliminary lipoxygenase inactivation model was employed to understand the low temperature drying effect on the flavour producing enzyme. Volatile and non-volatile flavour measurements were carried out for all the test dried samples. FD and HPD- dried tomatoes of the same cultivar were not significantly different from each other. Generally, acid concentration increased while sugar concentration decreased with increased thermal processing. Microwave vacuum drying operated under high vacuum of 0. 1 mbar (also called as microwave freeze drying) produced the best flavour quality, followed by HPD. An integrated approach of instrumental and sensory analysis was adopted to investigate the drying impact on the stability of flavour compounds and their associated sensory attributes. The volatile and sensory profiles of HPD- and FD-dried tomatoes were comparable, whereas loss of compounds contributing to fresh green aroma and presence of heat-induced compounds contributing to a cooked aroma were detected in the SPD-dried tomatoes and paste. Volatiles were found to be a good marker than non-volatiles. They were highly significant for discriminating the sensory attributes of processed tomatoes, allowing a better insight into the development of mild drying techniques...|$|E

Foram avaliadas as características sensoriais, físicas e químicas de pêssegos 'Douradão' armazenados sob refrigeração e diferentes condições de atmosfera modificada (sacos de PEBD nas espessuras de 30; 50; 60 e 75 µm). Após 14; 21 e 28 dias de estocagem refrigerada (1 ± 1 ºC e 90 ± 5 % UR), as embalagens plásticas foram retiradas, e as amostras foram mantidas sob ar ambiente durante 4 dias para amadurecimento. A terminologia descritiva e os perfis sensoriais dos pêssegos foram desenvolvidos baseados na Análise Descritiva Quantitativa (ADQ). Os provadores, consensualmente, definiram descritores sensoriais, os respectivos materiais de referência e a ficha de avaliação. Quatorze provadores foram selecionados de acordo com sua capacidade de discriminação e reprodutibilidade. Sete descritores foram gerados, mostrando similaridades e diferenças entre as amostras. Os dados foram analisados por ANOVA, teste de Tukey e Análise de Componentes Principais (ACP). Durante a estocagem refrigerada, as atmosferas desenvolvidas dentro das embalagens diferiram significativamente. A ACP mostrou que os tratamentos AM 50 e AM 60 foram mais caracterizados pelo sabor de pêssego fresco, aparência de pêssego fresco, suculência e firmeza da polpa, e foram efetivos na manutenção da boa qualidade dos pêssegos 'Douradão', durante 28 dias de armazenamento refrigerado. Os tratamentos AM 30 e Controle foram caracterizados pela lanosidade; o tratamento AM 75 apresentou as menores intensidades para os atributos avaliados, e eles foram ineficientes na manutenção da qualidade dos frutos frigoconservados.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of freezing methods and post-mortem ageing days for frozen beef m. longissimus lumborum (LL) on colour, moisture characteristics; characteristics and sensory characteristics. There were 3 freezing treatments: fresh, never frozen (FR); quick-frozen (QF), and slow-frozen (SF). All fresh and frozen beef m. longissimus lumborum samples were aged for 3 or 14 -days and frozen beef samples were frozen before ageing. Materials and methods Three replications of 7 beef samples (steaks) per treatment (total of 3 -days, n= 126) were used. Fresh beef samples (FR) were kept in a cold room at 3 °C until the next morning (Day 3). Slow-frozen samples (SF) were packed in a single layer on 3 shelves of a house hold freezer (AEG Skandiluxe) to reach a core temperature of - 20 °C. Quick-frozen samples (QF) were placed in a single layer on 3 shelves of an IcematicT 15 - 2 P blast freezer to a reach to core temperature of - 30 °C in 3 hours. All samples for the two freezing treatments were stored after the freezing processing at - 20 °C freezer room and were then thawed in vacuum packages for 18 hours at 3 °C in a dark chiller before analyses. Results Moisture characteristics The freezing methods and ageing days had a significant effect (P< 0. 001) on moisture characteristics but showed no effect on cooking losses. Drip loss and more pressed out water were higher for samples aged for 3 -days compared to 14 -days ageing postmortem. The effect of ageing days on moisture characterises was different for fresh compared to frozen beef samples (interaction: P< 0. 001). Drip loss of frozen steaks during 3 -days ageing post-mortem was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) than those aged for 14 -days. Drip loss between fresh samples aged for 3 and 14 -days nor between frozen samples aged for 3 or 14 -days. Colour characteristics Most colour characteristics were significantly affected by freezing methods and postmortem ageing days. Fresh beef samples had significantly higher (P< 0. 001) values for redness (a*) and chroma, lower values (P< 0. 05) for hue (closer to typical red colour) and were brighter (higher L*) than samples of both freezing methods. Higher (P< 0. 001) OxyMb and lower MetMb were recorded for fresh compared to frozen samples. Beef samples aged for 3 -days had lower (P< 0. 05) b* (less yellow) and hue angle values than those aged for 14 -days. DeoxyMb and OxyMb were higher and MetMb lower (P< 0. 05) in 3 -days samples compared to 14 -days samples. Sensory characteristics Freezing method had a significant effect (P< 0. 001) on WBSF, tenderness related sensory attributes and meat <b>flavour.</b> <b>Fresh</b> samples were tougher than frozen samples according to WBSF and sensory scores for first bite, overall tenderness, and residual connective tissue. In addition, quick-frozen samples were also significantly more tender (P< 0. 001) than slow-frozen samples according to all three tenderness related sensory parameters. Conclusion Overall, freezing methods and post-mortem ageing days influenced moisture and colour characteristics of beef. Quick freezing method improves tenderness measured as WBSF or sensory tenderness, but neither freezing method nor post-mortem ageing period (day 3 and day 14) had a meaningful effect on cooking losses.

It is also used whole in boiled and simmered dishes. The pandan (screwpine) leaf is the Asian equivalent of vanilla in Western cuisine. The subtle aroma is released when the leaves are bruised by tying one or two long leaves into a knot, and used for cooking curries, rice and desserts. The leaves can also be used to wrap items like rice, chicken or fish for cooking. Pandan leaf is also available in liquid essence or powdered form to flavour and colour cakes.

40|$|ABSTRACT Banana is {{the main}} product of a dry land farming at Gumbrih. The shelf life of fresh banana is very short and hence {{it is a great}} effort {{to find out how to}} {{preserve}} the banana for longer period. A method that can be applied is that by processing the fresh banana into processed foods, which has longer shelf life and easily to be modified into several products, which still retains the <b>flavour</b> of <b>fresh</b> banana. 	It was found that the knowledge of the local people (Gumrih villagers) on technology and banana processing was quite low and hence the recent program on course and practices of banana processing into dried banana (pisang sale) and banana powder (tepung pisang) is absolutely important. The activities were held at Desa Gumbrih, Kecamatan Pekutanan, Kabuapten Negara, on Friday, 16 September 2005, attended by 26 participants. Instead of course and practical works, the activities also have been conducted by active two-direction discussion between participants and tutor members. 	Since participants were curious to follow all the activities and we suggest that similar program is significant to be held on those banana producers around Bali and the short practical course would be more beneficial if it can be associated with marketing of the products. </em...|$|R
40|$|Fresh lemons (Citrus limon L.) {{from two}} {{locations}} in Italy {{were added to}} fresh olives before milling them to produce flavoured olive oils (FOO). FOOs were characterized for their quality parameters, fatty acid composition, biophenol content, volatile compound composition and sensory profile. Sensory results showed that lemon volatiles would mask negative notes of olive oil obtained from olives with slight offflavours by adding strong notes of lemon leaf, albedo and lemon juice, while they decreased the positive notes of olive fruit, green, leaf and bitter-pungent from good quality olives. Flavouring OO with lemon significantly affected quality indices, with a significant increase of the acidity value and UV indices. OO <b>flavouring</b> with <b>fresh</b> lemon also affected the phenolic compounds, particularly the simplest forms, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol. A dramatic decrease of the concentration of aldehydic and dialdehydic forms of oleuropein was also observed in FOO. As expected, volatile profile of virgin OO dramatically changed due to lemons addition, which caused the presence of several terpene compounds, namely limonene, apinene, b-pinene, sabinene, b-mircene and g-terpinene. In contrast, virgin OO volatile compounds decreased with lemon addition.
