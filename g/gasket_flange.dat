50|$|The Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) is {{the body}} that defined the WR designations for {{standard}} rectangular waveguides. EIA flanges are designated CMR (for Connector, Miniature, Rectangular waveguide) or CPR (Connector, Pressurizable, Rectangular waveguide) followed by the EIA number (WR number) for the relevant waveguide. So for example, CPR112 is a <b>gasket</b> <b>flange</b> for waveguide WR112 (WG15).|$|E
50|$|IEC flanges are {{identified}} by an alphanumeric code consisting of; the letter U, P or C for Unpressurizable (plain cover), Pressurizable (with a gasket groove) and Choke (with both choke gasket grooves); a second letter, indicating {{the shape and}} other details of the flange and finally the IEC identifier for the waveguide. For standard rectangular waveguide the second letter is A to E, where A and C are round flanges, B is square and D and E are rectangular. So for example UBR220 is a square plain cover flange for R220 waveguide (that is, for WG20, WR42), PDR84 is a rectangular <b>gasket</b> <b>flange</b> for R84 waveguide (WG15, WR112) and CAR70 is a round choke flange for R70 waveguide (WG14, WR137).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Pipe joints {{have been}} widely {{utilized}} in industrial plants, where dynamic load of vibration is considerably harmful for sealing performance. However, there is a lock of design codes and experimental procedures developed for vibration testing of pipe joints. This paper proposes an experimental setup for testing of pipe joints, which use metal gaskets, in vibratory conditions. Also, a flexible piezoelectric film sensor is introduced into this test rig for monitoring of stress in pipes. With the proposed test rig, vibration testing of pipe joints can be conducted, therefore further investigations such as fatigue analysis of the contact surfaces, and computational analysis of metal gaskets and seal devices are readily available. Finally, some experimental results of a <b>gasketed</b> <b>flange</b> joint, which uses a 1. 5 -inch diameter stainless steel gasket, were reported...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Industrial {{standards}} establish technical {{criteria for}} various engineering artifacts, materials, or services, {{with a view}} to ensuring their functionality, safety, and reliability. We develop a methodology and tools to systematically formalize such standards, in particular their domain specific calculation methods, in order to support the automatic verification of functional properties for concrete physical artifacts. We approach this problem in the setting of the Bremen heterogeneous tool set HETS, which allows for the integrated use {{of a wide range of}} generic and custom-made logics. Specifically, we (i) design a domain specific language for the formalization of industrial standards; (ii) formulate a semantics of this language in terms of a translation into the higher-order specification language HASCASL, and (iii) integrate computer algebra systems (CAS) with the HETS framework via a generic CAS-Interface in order to execute explicit and implicit calculations specified in the standard. This enables a wide variety of added-value services based on formal reasoning, including verification of parameterized de-signs and simplification of standards for particular configurations. We illustrate our approach using the European standard EN 1591, which concerns calculation methods for <b>gasketed</b> <b>flange</b> connections that assure the impermeability and me-chanical strength of the flange-bolt-gasket system. ...|$|R
40|$|Bolted {{flanged joints}} {{comprise}} an assembly {{of a number}} of important individual components, which are required to perform well together in service. The ideal requirement for a bolted flange joint is a 'zero-leak' condition. However, whilst recommended design procedures for bolted flange joints are available in international codes and standards, leakage problems are still faced by industry. These are common in both normal operating (internal pressure loading) and critical event conditions. The drive is, therefore, to find a flange joint assembly, which provides 'zero-leak condition' and requires little or no maintenance and handling. Considerable investigation in the area of optimised bolted joints has been in progress for the past 10 years comparing traditional gasketed joints and 'compact non-gasketed' joints, using both analytical and experimental approaches. In this present study, two-dimensional non-linear finite element studies have been performed for both gasketed and non-gasketed bolted flange pipe joints. Based on the stress results for the flange and the bolt and the flange rotation/displacement, compact non-gasketed flange joints are shown to be a viable and preferable alternative to the conventional <b>gasketed</b> <b>flange</b> joints. Recommendations are made for a best-fit flange model for static load conditions with 'zero-leak' sealing in a flange joint...|$|R

5000|$|Several vacuum flange {{standards}} exist, and {{the same}} flange types are called by different names by different manufacturers and standards organizations.CF (ConFlat) flanges use a copper <b>gasket</b> and knife-edge <b>flange</b> to achieve an ultrahigh vacuum seal. The term [...] "ConFlat" [...] is a registered trademark of Varian, Inc., so [...] "CF" [...] is commonly used by other flange manufacturers. Each face of the two mating CF flanges has a knife edge, which cuts into the softer metal gasket, providing an extremely leak-tight, metal-to-metal seal. Deformation of the metal gasket fills small defects in the flange, allowing Conflat flanges operate down to 10−13 Torr (10−11 Pa) pressure. The knife edge is recessed in a groove in each flange. In addition to protecting the knife edge, the groove helps hold the gasket in place, which aligns the two flanges and also reduces gasket expansion during bake-out. For stainless-steel conflat flanges, baking temperatures of 450 °C can be achieved; the temperature {{is limited by the}} choice of <b>gasket</b> material. CF <b>flanges</b> are sexless and interchangeable. In North America, flange sizes are given by flange outer diameter in inches, while in Europe and Asia, sizes are given by tube inner diameter in millimeters.

40|$|Wake fields excited {{in a small}} gap of {{a vacuum}} chamber by ampere beams can have enough {{amplitude}} to heat the chamber.

If a small gap occurs between the RF <b>gasket</b> and <b>flange</b> surface, wake fields can heat the flanges. The flanges are usually made of stainless steel, which efficiently absorbs RF power. Some flanges consist of two parts (like a vacuum valve flange) and are mechanically connected but have poor thermal contact. A temperature rise can lengthen the inner part of the flange and make firmer the thermal contact to the outer part of the flange. The heat will then flow to the outer part of the flange, which is air and water-cooled. This cooling lowers the flange temperature and the thermal contact becomes poor again.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the gasket stress distributions, hub stress and a {{variation}} in axial bolt force in bolted <b>gasketed</b> pipe <b>flange</b> connections under internal pressure are analyzed using elasto-plastic FEM {{taking into account}} the nonlinearity of gasket behavior. Non-asbestos spiral wound gaskets were employed. The effect of nominal flange diameter is examined on the gasket contact stress distributions, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force (the load factor) is examined. Using the obtained gasket contact stress distribution and the fundamental data of the relationship between gasket compressive stress and gasket leak rate according to JIS B 2490, a method for predicting the leak rate is demonstrated. Experiments to measure the amount of leakage, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force when the joint is under internal pressure were carried out. The numerical results of the leak rate, hub stress and the load factor are in a fairly good agreement with the measured results. Then, a method is demonstrated for determining the bolt preload under given conditions, that is, taking into account assembly efficiency, leak rate and internal pressure In addition, bolt preload is determined using the actual gasket contact stress which can be estimated using the value of the load factor. As a design example, the procedure for determining the bolt preload in 3 ” and 20 “ nominal diameter pipe flange connections is shown for the allowable leak rate of 1. 0 - 3 Pa ･m 3 /s.
