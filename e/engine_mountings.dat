5|$|Although the XCG-17 {{failed to}} lead to any {{production}} of a C-47 derived glider type, a single C-47 was converted {{in the field to}} glider configuration by the Fifth Air Service Area Command, located at Nichols Field on Luzon in the Philippines, during January 1946. Carried out in much the same manner as the XCG-17, the conversion included octagonally shaped fairings over the <b>engine</b> <b>mountings,</b> with an auxiliary power unit from a B-24 Liberator bomber being installed.|$|E
25|$|DH.18A: Initial {{production}} version – modified undercarriages and <b>engine</b> <b>mountings.</b> Three built – (G-EARO, G-EAUF, G-EAWO).|$|E
25|$|The Robbe had upward tilted, stabilizing, chined floats {{at about}} one third span, each mounted on N-form struts and {{transversely}} braced with converging struts to the wing below the <b>engine</b> <b>mountings.</b> Each float was divided into three watertight compartments.|$|E
5000|$|The Potez XVIII airliner, {{displayed}} at the 1922 Paris Salon, was a development of the Potez X colonial transport. It was an unequal span biplane largely built of wood, though with metal <b>engines</b> <b>mountings</b> and other fittings, engine nacelles and tail surfaces. The rectangular plan wings were fabric covered. On each side, towards the wing tips a parallel pair of interplane struts leaned outwards. Closer to the fuselage a parallel pair of V-form interplane struts formed a cradle for the outboard engines, mounted between the wings. These, and the third in the nose, were Lorraine 8Bds, water-cooled V-8 engines, each producing cooled by cylindrical radiators hung beneath each engine nacelle. Ailerons with aerodynamic balances extending past the wing-tips were fitted on the lower wing only.|$|R
50|$|The Wave is {{available}} with three displacements - 100 cc, 110 cc and 125 cc. The 100 and 110 cc models' engine is physically similar size to the Cub <b>engine,</b> sharing <b>mountings,</b> while the 125cc models use a larger engine, {{incompatible with the}} Cub and 100/110 mountings. In addition to the three models that use carburetors, Honda also produces the fuel-injected model starting in 2008 for 110 cc and 125 cc models. The 100 cc model was discontinued in 2008.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was based}} on the Vickers Vanox (Vickers [...] "Type 150") scaled up to take four <b>engines</b> in paired <b>mountings.</b> It was {{submitted}} both as a bomber and as a troop carrier to Air Ministry specifications B.19/27 and C.16/28 respectively, first flying on 12 January 1931.Only one was produced.|$|R
25|$|After factory tests proved promising, {{military}} {{acceptance trials}} commenced on 19 October 1916 {{and led to}} the aircraft being purchased for the Luftstreitkräfte. Soon thereafter trouble set in, with crankshafts repeatedly failing. This was attributed mostly to the engine design, but new <b>engine</b> <b>mountings</b> and universal joints for each end of the drive shafts were fitted to mitigate the problem, along with extended wings and other improvements.|$|E
25|$|The first DH.18 was {{delivered}} to Aircraft Transport and Travel for use on the Croydon-Paris service, but was wrecked in a forced landing shortly after takeoff from Croydon on 16 August 1920. Two more aircraft were under construction by Airco for Aircraft Transport and Travel when the bankrupt Airco was purchased by BSA, who {{did not wish to}} continue aircraft development or production. Geoffrey de Havilland, the chief designer of Airco then set up the de Havilland Aircraft Company, completing the two partly completed aircraft as DH.18As, with improved <b>engine</b> <b>mountings</b> and undercarriages.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic design}} of the Typhoon was a {{combination}} of traditional Hawker construction (such as used in the earlier Hawker Hurricane) and more modern construction techniques; the front fuselage structure, from the <b>engine</b> <b>mountings</b> {{to the rear of the}} cockpit, was made up of bolted and welded duralumin or steel tubes covered with skin panels, while the rear fuselage was a flush-riveted, semi-monocoque structure. The forward fuselage and cockpit skinning was made up of large, removable duralumin panels, allowing easy external access to the engine and engine accessories and most of the important hydraulic and electrical equipment.|$|E
5000|$|The 1973 {{introduction}} of an 1807 cc version with a claimed [...] addressed performance concerns and {{was accompanied by}} redesigned <b>engine</b> and transmission <b>mountings</b> intended to reduce interior noise. The final K70s did out-accelerate the final 412s, and had a higher maximum speed with the 411/412 offering a fuel mileage advantage.|$|R
50|$|The {{collision}} with the antenna caused {{the nose and}} right wing landing gear to collapse, the nose landing gear being forced back into the fuselage. The aircraft slid along in a nose-down, right wing low attitude, causing some further damage to the nose and damage to the two right <b>engines</b> and their <b>mountings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Like its contemporaries in {{its class}} the XS 650 has a 360° crank angle. This {{provides}} an even firing interval {{between the two}} cylinders, but also generates some vibration caused by the two pistons rising and falling together. This vibration is particularly noticeable at idle. Because of a long-acknowledged vibration issue, starting with the 1974 models, vibration damping modifications {{were made to the}} <b>engine</b> and handlebar <b>mountings.</b>|$|R
500|$|In February 1929, West Honaker was bareboat {{chartered}} by the [...] {{for the new}} Pacific–South Africa Line, an around-the-world venture {{under the}} management of J. J. Moore & Company. The Pacific–South Africa Line service—the world's only all-diesel around-the-world service, as described by the Los Angeles Times—sailed from Los Angeles to South Africa via the Straits of Magellan, across the Indian Ocean to Japan and China, across the Pacific to San Francisco, and back to Los Angeles. West Honakers first voyage in the South African service was planned for November, but upon her arrival from New York to begin the service, {{it was discovered that}} she had cracks in her <b>engine</b> <b>mountings</b> and her cylinder head. West Honaker made her way to San Francisco, where parts were fabricated for the $100,000 repair. This kept her out of service until March 1930.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{powered by}} two wing-mounted [...] Gnome-Rhône 14Krs Mistral Major {{fourteen}} cylinder radial engines driving three blade variable pitch propellers. The <b>engine</b> <b>mountings</b> were steel tube structures {{supported by the}} longerons; the engine cowlings were most prominent above the wings. The main legs of the [...] track landing gear, with fairings mounted on the front of, them retracted rearwards into the cowlings. The undercarriage was completed with a oleo mounted, steerable tailwheel. There were fuel tanks in the central section of the wings between both the engines and the longerons.|$|E
2500|$|The new Sakae was {{slightly}} heavier and somewhat longer {{due to the}} larger supercharger, which moved {{the center of gravity}} too far forward on the existing airframe. To correct for this, the <b>engine</b> <b>mountings</b> were cut back by 185mm to move the engine toward the cockpit. This had the side effect of reducing the size of the main fuselage fuel tank (located between the engine and the cockpit) from [...] to [...] The cowling was redesigned to enlarge the cowl flaps, revise the oil cooler air intake, and move the carburetor air intake to the upper half of the cowling.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} attempt {{to address these}} {{problems}} {{took place on the}} platform where they were first noticed, the Douglas Skyrocket. This took the form of a series of vortex generators added to the outboard portions of the wing, breaking up the boundary layer. However, this was found to have almost no effect in practice. Nevertheless, a similar solution was attempted on the Boeing B-47 Stratojet where it proved considerably more effective. This may have been helped by the presence of the podded <b>engines,</b> whose vertical <b>mountings</b> acted as barriers to span wise flow.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{accident}} the Air Ministry ordered four more flying-boats to be designated the Kingston Mk. I. The first Kingston I N9709 was ready {{a few months}} later, only small changes were made from the prototype including a slightly larger beam and two-bladed propellers. The flying-boat was delivered by rail to the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe in November 1924 for acceptance trials. Although the flying-boat met the type and air-handling requirements it {{did not meet the}} Ministries' requirements for seaworthiness. Modifications were made to N9709 for improvements including four-bladed propellers. On 25 May 1925, just after becoming airborne the <b>engines</b> left their <b>mountings</b> and the wing structure failed causing cracks in the hull, the aircraft floated and the crew escaped without injury.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{powered by}} a nose-mounted, [...] Renault 4Pb, a four-cylinder, air-cooled, upright inline <b>engine,</b> though its <b>mountings,</b> part of the tubular {{fuselage}} structure, could accept engines with powers in the range [...] The exhaust was fitted with a silencer and its outlet was aft of the cabin. Fuel was held in two tanks in the wing centre-section and oil in the fuselage aft of the engine firewall. Its enclosed cabin, entered via centrally hinged, multi-part glazing, had two forward seats, equipped with dual controls, and a rear bench seat. It was normally flown from the left-hand seat, where the rudder bar was fitted with brake pedals. The flap lever was placed centrally. The fuselage was fabric covered apart from the engine area and the sloping fuselage roof and upper part aft of the cabin, which was covered with electron metal sheet.|$|R
2500|$|The Hawk 4 had a steel {{rotor mast}} and <b>engine</b> <b>mountings</b> but was mostly {{aluminium}} elsewhere, including the rotor, rotor head and propeller. The fuselage was an aluminium semi-monocoque. [...] Some components, {{such as the}} nosecone, engine cowling and cabin door were formed from composite materials. [...] The rotor was a semi-rigid or teetering design with a swash plate, rotating at up to 270 rpm. [...] Yaw was jointly controlled by the balanced rudders on the endplate fins and the all-moving inboard rudders. [...] It had a fixed, tricycle undercarriage with mainwheels mounted at {{the tips of the}} stub wings. [...] Two rows of seats accommodated the pilot and up to three passengers; alternatively, the rear seats could be folded to provide baggage space.|$|E
2500|$|... {{the very}} {{successful}} Handley Page H.P.42 {{but the second}} type did not get beyond the design stage as Imperial later [...] decided {{that they did not}} want it. Nonetheless, when Air Ministry specification C.16/28 was issued, calling for a replacement [...] bomber-transport for the Handley Page Clive and Vickers Victoria, Handley Page offered a design which used the tri-motor's wings and <b>engine</b> <b>mountings</b> married to a new monocoque fuselage with gun positions and a revised tail. [...] The Air Ministry ordered a prototype with the proviso that it should have a more familiar fabric covered and gauze windowed fuselage of tubular construction. [...] This aircraft was the H.P.43. [...] Only two other manufactures had submitted types in competition: the Vickers Type 163 was accepted as a private venture only and the Gloster TC.33 prototype was ordered after the specification had been widened to include four-engined types.|$|E
2500|$|The Z.515 was a {{cantilever}} {{low wing}} monoplane with straight tapered wings of noticeable dihedral and rounded tips. [...] There were flaps inboard of the ailerons. Twin 560kW (750hp) V-12 Isotta-Fraschini Delta engines were mounted well {{forward of the}} leading edge with their thrust line in the wing plane. [...] The fairings behind <b>engine</b> <b>mountings</b> on the wing underside extended aft to near the trailing edge; the rear engine mounting also supported the forward attachment points for the rearward sloping, N-form struts to the two long, single stepped floats. [...] The floats were laterally braced by inverted-V struts {{to the bottom of}} the fuselage. [...] The Z.515's tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage with greater dihedral than the wing and carrying endplate fins. [...] The horizontal surfaces were straight tapered and the elevators, like the rudders had trim tabs. [...] The vertical surfaces were almost elliptical, split roughly equally between fin and unbalanced rudder.|$|E
5000|$|At Le Mans, Maréchal's car {{was well}} placed — 7th overall, 4th in the Index of Performance — when a brake line fractured, causing a brake fluid leak. He continued. With three hours left to run, he was without brakes but had {{improved}} to 4th overall. Motor Sport summarized his ensuing accident: [...] "Alas, {{just as we}} hoped to see Maréchal press for his third place, it was reported at 1.05pm that the Aston Martin saloon had overturned at White House corner, Pierre being seriously hurt. His brakes had, it seems, been absent for many laps." [...] The crash tore the <b>engine</b> from its <b>mountings</b> and flattened the roof, trapping Maréchal inside. Delage driver Louis Gérard, first on the scene, stopped to extricate him, losing two laps in the process. (Gérard would finish fourth.) Maréchal {{was taken to the}} nearby Delagenière clinic, where he succumbed to his injuries the next day. He was buried in his family's vault at Bailly, near Versailles. He was 33.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{initially}} powered by twelve [...] Siemens-built Bristol Jupiter radial <b>engines</b> in tandem <b>mountings</b> (i.e. a [...] "push-pull" [...] configuration), with six tractor propellers and six pushers mounted in six strut-mounted nacelles above the wing. The nacelles {{were joined by}} an auxiliary wing whose purpose was to stabilize the mountings. The air-cooled Jupiter engines were prone to overheating and could barely lift the Do X to an altitude of 425 m (1,400 ft). The engines were supervised by a flight engineer, who also controlled the 12 throttles and monitored the 12 sets of engine gauges. The pilot would ask the engineer to adjust the power setting, {{in a manner similar}} to the system used on maritime vessels, i.e. an engine order telegraph. Indeed, many aspects of the aircraft echoed nautical arrangements of the time, including the flight deck, which bore a strong resemblance to bridge of a vessel. After completing 103 flights in 1930, the Do X was refitted with [...] Curtiss V-1570 [...] "Conqueror" [...] water-cooled V-12 Vee engine. Only then was it able to reach the altitude of 500 m (1,650 ft) necessary to cross the Atlantic.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{production}} model, the Sea Fury F Mk X (Fighter, Mk 10), flew in September 1946. With {{the completion}} of flight testing at Boscombe Down in 1946, the trials process was repeated aboard the aircraft carrier [...] Carrier testing revealed directional stability issues related to rudder effectiveness during landing, and this was resolved by {{the adoption of a}} tail wheel lock, which also improved the wheel retraction behaviour. Several rectifying design changes were made by Hawker in response to feedback from the test pilots, including the adoption of a five-bladed Rotol propeller to greatly reduce overspeed tendencies, a re-designed rudder assembly to increase rudder effectiveness, Dynafocal <b>engine</b> <b>mountings</b> to reduce vibration at low speeds, and an improved undercarriage with greater flexibility; these changes greatly improved the aircraft's deck landing characteristics. Arrestor hook trials initially revealed the Sea Fury to be prone to missing the wires, this was rapidly resolved by modifications to the hook dampener mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 June 1943, {{the first}} Tempest Mk.II, LA602, flew {{powered by a}} Centaurus IV (2,520hp/1,879kW) driving a four-blade propeller. LA602 {{initially}} flew with a Typhoon-type fin and rudder unit. This {{was followed by the}} second, LA607, which was completed with the enlarged dorsal fin and first flew on 18 September 1943: LA607 was assigned to engine development. The first major problem experienced during the first few flights was serious engine vibrations, which were cured by replacing the rigid, eight-point <b>engine</b> <b>mountings</b> with six-point rubber-packed shock mounts. In a further attempt to alleviate engine vibration, the four blade propeller was replaced with a five blade unit; eventually, a finely balanced four bladed unit was settled on. Problems were also experienced with engine overheating, poor crankshaft lubrication, exhaust malfunctions and reduction-gear seizures. Because of these problems, and because of the decision to [...] "tropicalise" [...] all Tempest IIs for service in the South-East Asian theatre, production was delayed.|$|E
2500|$|The fuselages of the Types 20 and 22 {{were similar}} flat-sided {{structures}} based on four cross-braced longerons, {{each of three}} parts. [...] Since {{the nose of the}} 22 did not terminate in a propeller, the high cockpit of the 20 was replaced with a blunt-nosed cabin, curved in planform, for the pilot. [...] Behind him the passenger seats in the Type 22 were in pairs, each with their own window. Boarding and disembarking were reported as a little difficult. The wing-mounted engines led to revised wing plans and structures. The Breguet 22 had equal-span, unstaggered wings of rectangular plan and three bays. [...] The innermost bay was defined by the engine by the <b>engine</b> <b>mountings,</b> which placed the U.16s with their four-blade tractor propellers on multiple struts midway between the two wings. Radiators were mounted {{on the sides of the}} engine cowling. [...] The outer bays were formed by single interplane struts with forked junctions into the wings, assisted by cross-bracing. [...] At the rear the tail was, like that of the Type 20, quite small and conventional with the tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage but now carrying a pair of small additional fins. [...] The landing gear was also conventional, with each fixed mainwheel mounted on a pair of substantial V-form legs from the wing spars under the inner bay.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nose section}} {{contained}} the V-12 Hispano-Suiza 12Nb engine, which produced 462kW (620hp) at 2,000rpm and drove a two blade propeller. A chin radiator was mounted below the fuselage firewall, with a long, prominent fairing behind it. The <b>engine</b> <b>mountings</b> were extended rearwards beyond the pilot's cabin {{to join the}} steel tubes in the wings. [...] The cabin, fitted with dual controls, was accessed via glazed triangular doors, which provided sufficient sideways vision for cruising flight. A hatch, provided with a small windscreen was used for take-offs and landings by raising the pilot's seat. [...] The navigator sat alongside the pilot on a drop seat. His space, 2m (79in) long and 1m (39in) wide, had side and roof windows for sightings. Internally, the rear part of the fuselage, mounted {{on the other end}} of the wing's four steel tubes, provided a space for the crew to rest during a long flight. The aerodynamically clean, tapered, elliptical rear section was built around four longerons, with a plywood skin and outer fabric sheath. [...] The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and the fin and rudder together were roughly elliptical. [...] The fixed, tailwheel undercarriage had split axles hinged to the bottom of the fuselage, with the wheels and main legs enclosed in narrow, wide chord fairings.|$|E
2500|$|After the end {{of world}} War I some Caudron C.23s, a large trimotor night bomber, were {{modified}} to act as passenger aircraft, but the C.25 was the first aircraft Caudron had designed from the beginning to carry passengers. It was large, with a [...] span, so Caudron built in hinges to allow the wings to be folded for easier handling on the ground. The wings were rectangular in plan, mounted without stagger and fabric covered. It was a three bay biplane with unusually thin, wooden, parallel, vertical interplane struts, assisted by flying wires of thicker than usual gauge. [...] The <b>engine</b> <b>mountings,</b> two pairs of parallel struts, defined the inner bay. The outer pair of these struts were doubled since this was where the wing folded and so the ends of the wing either side of the fold retained their struts. [...] Four vertical cabane struts braced the centre of the upper wing from the upper fuselage. There were ailerons on both lower and lower planes, extending over more than half the span. These were not aerodynamically balanced in the usual way but were connected to each other by three vertical rods which halfway up were hinged to the trailing edge of a narrower and shorter horizontal surface which rotated about an axis well behind its aerodynamic centre. The wires from the cockpit operated these ancillary surfaces, which then moved the ailerons, just as the leading edge of a conventional balanced aileron, extending forward of the hinge, assists the pilot's input.|$|E

50|$|With the FN Typ 2000, the car also gained {{flexible}} <b>engine</b> <b>mountings.</b> This {{was followed}} by the Typ 2700 which, for the first time, was powered by engines designed and built by FN themselves.|$|E
50|$|The H.2 cabin structure, {{landing gear}} and Eagle VIII <b>engine</b> <b>mountings</b> were {{incorporated}} into the 1926 ANEC III. This was a biplane and was about 30% longer though still a six-seater; three were used in Australia by LASCo.|$|E
