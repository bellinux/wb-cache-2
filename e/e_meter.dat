40|$|Implicit {{learning}} (IL) occurs unintentionally. IL {{of temporal}} patterns has received minimal attention, and results are mixed regarding whether IL of temporal patterns {{occurs in the}} absence of a concurrent ordinal pattern. Two experiments examined the IL of temporal patterns and the conditions under which IL is exhibited. Experiment 1 examined whether uncertainty of the upcoming stimulus identity obscures learning. Based on probabilistic uncertainty, it was hypothesized that stimulus-detection tasks are more sensitive to temporal learning than multiple-alternative forced-choice tasks because of response uncertainty in the latter. Results demonstrated IL of metrical patterns in the stimulus-detection but not the multiple-alternative task. Experiment 2 investigated whether properties of rhythm (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>meter)</b> benefit IL using the stimulus-detection task. The metric binding hypothesis states that metrical frameworks guide attention to periodic points in time. Based on the metric binding hypothesis, it was hypothesized that metrical patterns are learned faster than nonmetrical patterns. Results demonstrated learning of metrical and nonmetrical patterns but metrical patterns were not learned more readily than nonmetrical patterns. However, abstraction of a metrical framework was still evident in the metrical condition. The present study shows IL of auditory temporal patterns {{in the absence of}} an ordinal pattern...|$|E

40|$|Music has a {{pervasive}} tendency to rhythmically engage our body. In contrast, synchronization with speech is rare. Music’s superiority over speech in driving movement probably results from isochrony of musical beats, {{as opposed to}} irregular speech stresses. Moreover, the presence of regular patterns of embedded periodicities (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>meter)</b> may be critical in making music particularly conducive to movement. We investigated these possibilities by asking participants to synchronize with isochronous auditory stimuli (target), while music and speech distractors were presented at one of various phase relationships {{with respect to the}} target. In Exp. 1, familiar musical excerpts and fragments of children poetry were used as distractors. The stimuli were manipulated in terms of beat/stress isochrony and average pitch to achieve maximum comparability. In Exp. 2, the distractors were well-known songs performed with lyrics, on a reiterated syllable, and spoken lyrics, all having the same meter. Music perturbed synchronization with the target stimuli more than speech fragments. However, music superiority over speech disappeared when distractors shared isochrony and the same meter.

On average, the repeated DEMs yield 22  % less elevation change than the length of eight winter snow cores due to (1) the time difference between in situ and satellite observations, (2) firn densification and (3) elevation changes due to ice dynamics. The contributions of these three factors were of similar magnitude.

40|$|Using {{spatially}} explicit simulation models, {{we explored}} {{the extent to}} which fine-scale (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>meters</b> to tens of meters) movement behaviors could be used to predict broader scale patterns of distribution on heterogeneous landscapes. Our models were tailored by empirical data on Calopterygid damselfly movements on three types of landscapes that differed in amount of forest habitat. Surveys of the two congeneric damselflies, Calopteryx aequabilis and Calopteryx maculata, demonstrated that both species occupied stream and forest habitats on forested and partially forested landscapes, but were found primarily along streams on nonforested landscapes. Simulation models whose parameters were derived using empirical movement data for both species showed that fine-scale movement behaviors could be used to predict, on average, broader scale dispersion across a range of landscape structures, but that it was necessary to include information about broader scale landscape features in those models. In particular, the probability of crossing a patch boundary (patch boundary permeability) and the rate of movement in a given habitat patch (patch viscosity) were important determinants of damselfly dispersion on heterogeneous landscapes. In other words, our results suggest that damselfly dispersions may arise as a function of behavioral responses to spatial patterns at multiple scales...|$|R

This {{software system}} is currently supporting the X 38 V 201 spacecraft component/system testing and is intended to give users the ability to create, test, deploy, and certify their subsystem displays in a fraction of the time that it would take to do so using previous software and programming methods. Within the visualization system there are three major components: the developer, the deployer, and the widget set. The developer is a blank canvas with widget menu items that give users the ability to easily create displays. The deployer is an application that allows for the deployment of the displays created using the developer application. The deployer has additional functionality that the developer does not have, such as printing of displays, screen captures to files, windowing of displays, and also serves as the interface into the documentation archive and help system. The third major component is the widget set. The widgets are the visual representation of the items that will make up the display (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>meters,</b> dials, buttons, numerical indicators, string indicators, and the like).

40|$|Wind generation’s {{contribution}} to meeting extreme peaks in electricity demand {{is a key}} concern for the integration of wind power. In Great Britain (GB), robustly assessing this contribution directly from power system data (i. <b>e.</b> <b>metered</b> wind-supply and electricity demand) is difficult as extreme peaks occur infrequently (by definition) and measurement records are both short and inhomogeneous. Atmospheric circulation-typing combined with meteorological reanalysis data is proposed {{as a means to}} address some of these difficulties, motivated by a case study of the extreme peak demand events in January 2010. A preliminary investigation of the physical and statistical properties of these circulation types suggests that they can be used to identify the conditions that {{are most likely to be}} associated with extreme peak demand events. Three broad cases are highlighted as requiring further investigation. The high-over-Britain anticyclone is found to be generally associated with very low winds but relatively moderate temperatures (and therefore moderate peak demands, somewhat in contrast to the classic low-wind cold snap that is sometimes apparent in the literature). In contrast, both longitudinally extended blocking over Scotland/Scandinavia and latitudinally extended troughs over western Europe appear to be more closely linked to the very cold GB temperatures (usually associated with extreme peak demands). In both of these latter situations, wind resource averaged across GB appears to be more moderate. ...|$|R

However, understanding mechanisms by which tumors evade elimination by the immune system of the host presents a significant challenge for developing effective cancer immunotherapies. The interaction of cancer cells with the host is a complex process that is distributed across a variety of time and length scales.

40|$|Information and {{communication}} technologies are increasingly transforming our urban lives, {{giving rise to}} what is {{commonly referred to as}} the ‘smart city’. Understood as technologically enhanced urban services (i. <b>e.</b> <b>metered,</b> networked, monitored and computed, mostly and preferably in real-time), the ICT industry showcases a full range of perfectly integrated ‘smart city’ technologies in pilot projects around the world. While still focusing on the technological understanding of ‘smart’, this paper, however, explores the less advertised and seemingly more trivial transformations happening in our existing cities. By doing so, three aspects of the process of becoming ‘smart’ are identified, highlighted and exemplified by a case in Stuttgart, Germany. First, the sector and often company connected and incremental approach make it unobtrusive and hardly noticeable as an integrated ‘smart city’ concept. Second, democratic and public debate is absent, as the promised or envisioned results are on the one hand seductive and desired and consequently (rightly) assumed to be a priori supported by majorities {{and on the other hand}} often designed and implemented by the private sector. Third, although individual transformations may not seem radical, their combined implications and potential for urban governance and planning can be profound, especially in combination with the renewed idea of rational, non-ideological decision making through algorithmic data analysis. This paper describes these aspects on the basis of the case polygo in Stuttgart, a recent effort to further digitalise and network public transport and private e-mobility services, effectively and incrementally implementing a ‘smart mobility’ concept throughout the Region of Stuttgart...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of smart electricity meters with cellular radio interface puts an additional {{load on the}} wireless cellular networks. Currently, these meters are designed for low duty cycle billing and occasional system check, which generates a low-rate sporadic traffic. As the number of distributed energy resources increases, the household power will become more variable and thus unpredictable {{from the viewpoint of}} the Distribution System Operator (DSO). It is therefore expected, in the near future, to have an increased number of Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS) devices with Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) -like capabilities in the distribution grid, thus allowing the utilities to monitor the low voltage grid quality while providing information required for tighter grid control. From a communication standpoint, the traffic profile will change drastically towards higher data volumes and higher rates per device. In this paper, we characterize the current traffic generated by smart electricity meters and supplement it with the potential traffic requirements brought by introducing enhanced Smart <b>Meters,</b> i. <b>e.,</b> <b>meters</b> with PMU-like capabilities. Our study shows how GSM/GPRS and LTE cellular system performance behaves with the current and next generation smart meters traffic, where it is clearly seen that the PMU data will seriously challenge these wireless systems.
