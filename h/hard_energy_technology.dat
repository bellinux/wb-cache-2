2500|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} are a complex energy system. [...] {{and opponents of}} nuclear power have criticized the sophistication and {{complexity}} of the technology. Helen Caldicott has said: [...] "... in essence, a nuclear reactor is just a very sophisticated and dangerous way to boil water – analogous to cutting a pound of butter with a chain saw." [...] These critics of nuclear power advocate the use of energy conservation, efficient energy use, and appropriate renewable <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> to create our energy future. Amory Lovins, from the Rocky Mountain Institute, has argued that centralized electricity systems with giant power plants are becoming obsolete. In their place are emerging [...] "distributed resources"—smaller, decentralized electricity supply sources (including efficiency) that are cheaper, cleaner, less risky, more flexible, and quicker to deploy. Such technologies are often called [...] "soft energy technologies" [...] and Lovins viewed their impacts as more gentle, pleasant, and manageable than <b>hard</b> <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> such as nuclear power.|$|R

40|$|To provide {{and improve}} {{national}} energy security and low-carbon green energy economy, as a government-supported research institute related to developing new and renewable <b>energy</b> <b>technologies,</b> including <b>energy</b> efficiency, Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) needs {{to establish a}} long-term strategic <b>energy</b> <b>technology</b> roadmap (ETRM) in the hydrogen economy sector for sustainable economic development. In this paper, we establish a strategic ETRM for hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> in the hydrogen economy considering five criteria: economic impact (EI), commercial potential (CP), inner capacity (IC), technical spin-off (TS), and development cost (DC). As an extended research, we apply the integrated two-stage multi-criteria decision-making approach, including the hybrid fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, to assess the relative efficiency of hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> in order to scientifically implement the hydrogen economy. Fuzzy AHP reflects the vagueness of human thought with interval values, and allocates the relative importance and weights of four criteria: EI, CP, IC, and TS. The DEA approach measures the relative efficiency of hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> for the hydrogen economy with a ratio of outputs over inputs. The result of measuring the relative efficiency of hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> focuses on 4 hydrogen technologies out of 13 hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies.</b> KIER has to focus on developing 4 strategic hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> from economic view point {{in the first phase}} with limited resources. In addition, if energy policy makers consider as some candidates for strategic hydrogen technologies of the other 9 hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technology,</b> the performance and productivity of 9 hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> should be increased and the input values of them have to be decreased. With a scientific decision-making approach, we can assess the relative efficiency of hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> efficiently and allocate limited research and development (R&D) resources effectively for well-focused R&D. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In this paper, {{the impacts of}} FDI renewable <b>energy</b> <b>technology</b> spillover on China’s energy industry performance are analyzed based on theoretical and empirical studies. Firstly, three hypotheses are proposed to illustrate the relationships between FDI renewable <b>energy</b> <b>technology</b> spillover and three energy industry performances including economic, environmental, and innovative performances. To verify the hypotheses, techniques including factor analysis and data envelopment analysis (DEA) are employed to quantify the FDI renewable <b>energy</b> <b>technology</b> spillover and the energy industry performance of China, respectively. Furthermore, a panel data regression model is proposed to measure the impacts of FDI renewable <b>energy</b> <b>technology</b> spillover on China’s energy industry performance. Finally, energy industries of 30 different provinces in China based on the yearbook data from 2005 to 2011 are comparatively analyzed for evaluating the impacts through the empirical research. The results demonstrate that FDI renewable <b>energy</b> <b>technology</b> spillover has positive impacts on China’s energy industry performance.
