40|$|BACKGROUND: Minimally {{invasive}} spine surgery limits surgical {{trauma and}} avoids traditional open surgery {{so in the}} majority of cases, recovery is much quicker and patients have less pain after surgery. AIM: The authors describe an endoscopic approach to anterior cervical <b>foraminotomy</b> (ACF) by Destandau's method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Anterior cervical <b>foraminotomy</b> by Destandau’s method is carried out under general anaesthesia. A 3 cm transverse skin incision is used just slightly past the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid's muscle laterally. After exposing and dissecting superficial cervical fascia, platysma muscle, and deep cervical fascia, Endospine material designed by Destandau will be inserted. As from this moment, the procedure will continue using endoscopy. RESULTS: the Endoscopic approach to anterior cervical <b>foraminotomy</b> by Destandau's method offers a convenient access to the cervical foraminal stenosis with fewer complications and negligible morbidity and gives maximum exposure to discal space with the goal of minimising cutaneous incision. CONCLUSION: Contrary to the other minimally invasive approaches, the visual field in <b>foraminotomy</b> by Destandau technique is broad and depending on the workability of Endospine an adequate access to cervical disc is possible...|$|E
40|$|Aim. We discuss {{technical}} points, the safety, {{and efficacy}} of ultrasonic bone shaver in various spinal surgeries within our own series. Methods. Between June 2010 and January 2014, 307 patients with various spinal diseases were operated on {{with the use of}} an ultrasonic bone curette with microhook shaver (UBShaver). Patients' data were recorded and analyzed retrospectively. The technique {{for the use of the}} device is described for each spine surgery procedure. Results. Among the 307 patients, 33 (10. 7 %) cases had cervical disorder, 17 (5. 5 %) thoracic disorder, 3 (0. 9 %) foramen magnum disorder, and 254 (82. 7 %) lumbar disorders. Various surgical techniques were performed either assisted or alone by UBShaver. The duration of the operations and the need for blood replacement were relatively low. The one-year follow-up with Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were improved. We had 5 cases of dural tears (1. 6 %) in patients with lumbar spinal disease. No neurological deficit was found in any patients. Conclusion. We recommend this device as an assistant tool in various spine surgeries and as a primary tool in <b>foraminotomies.</b> It is a safe device in spine surgery with very low complication rate...|$|R
40|$|In this {{retrospective}} study, 60 {{patients who}} are operated due to lumbar spinal stenosis are evaluated in respect to age, sex, symptoms of the disease, radiological findings, surgical procedures and clinical results. Clinical evaluation was done using Oswestry low back pain disability questionary. Of patients 31 were male, 29 were female, {{in a range of}} 15 - 84 years-old. Majority of patients were between 40 - 60 years-old. Radiologically all patients were evaluated with anteroposterior, lateral and dynamic plain radiographies, magnetic resonance imaging and last 11 patients were evaluated with additional magnetic resonance myelography also. Most frequent lumbar level was L 4 - 5 level, cause of the stenosis was congenital in four patients and degenerative in the remaining. Two surgical procedures were applied, laminectomy and <b>foraminotomies</b> in 43 patients and inverse laminoplasty in 17 patients. In 11 patients dural laceration complicated the operations but no patient developed cerebrospinal fluid fistula postoperatively. No neurological progression of present neorogical findings was observed. Clinically preoperative mean score of Oswestry was 41. 1 and decreased to 11. 3 postoperatively. During the follow up of 33 months, three patients were operated due to stenosis at the different levels and posterior spinal instrumentation was performed in four patients because of iatrogenic spondylolisthesis. In conclusion, lumbar spinal stenosis can be treated surgically by laminectomy successfully and inverse laminoplasty is preferred in young patients...|$|R
40|$|Context: Cervical spondylotic {{myelopathy}} (CSM) is {{a progressive}} disease {{that can result}} in significant disability. Single-level stenosis can be effectively decompressed through either anterior or posterior techniques. However, multilevel pathology can be challenging, especially {{in the presence of}} significant spinal stenosis. Three-level anterior decompression and fusion are associated with higher nonunion rates and prolonged dysphagia. Posterior multilevel laminectomies with <b>foraminotomies</b> jeopardize the bone stock required for stable fixation with lateral mass screws (LMSs). Aims: This is the first case series of multilevel laminectomy and fusion for CSM instrumented with posterior cervical cages. Settings and Design: Three patients presented with a history of worsening neck pain, numbness in bilateral upper extremities and gait disturbance, and examination findings consistent with myeloradiculopathy. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multilevel spondylosis resulting in moderate to severe bilateral foraminal stenosis at three cervical levels. Materials and Methods: The patients underwent a multilevel posterior cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion with intervertebral cages placed between bilateral facet joints over three levels. Oswestry disability index and visual analog scores were collected preoperatively and at each follow-up. Pre- and post-operative images were analyzed for changes in cervical alignment and presence of arthrodesis. Results: Postoperatively, all patients showed marked improvement in neurological symptoms and neck pain. They had full resolution of radicular symptoms by 6 weeks postoperatively. At 12 -month follow-up, they demonstrated solid arthrodesis on X-rays and computed tomography scan. Conclusions: Posterior cervical cages may be an alternative option to LMSs in multilevel cervical laminectomy and fusion for cervical spondylotic myeloradiculopathy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionCervical disc {{prolapse}} is {{a common}} disorder that results in spinal cord compression causing myelopathy or nerve root compression causing radiculopathy or both. For a posterolateral cervical disc prolapse causing radiculopathy, the common surgical approach used nowadays is the anterior approach to the cervical column. However, this is associated with many complications; {{some of them are}} devastating for example, carotid artery injury and cord injury. Therefore, the use of a simpler approach for the posterolateral disc prolapse is needed. The posterior approach making a keyhole <b>foraminotomy</b> is simpler. Aim of the workThe aim of this work was to evaluate the role of posterior keyhole <b>foraminotomy</b> for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy caused by posterolateral cervical disc prolapse as compared to the anterior approach for cervical discectomy. MethodsA retrospective study included 20 patients diagnosed with posterolateral cervical disc prolapse causing radiculopathy and they were divided into two groups each composed of 10 patients, group (1) had cervical anterior discectomy and group (2) had posterior cervical keyhole <b>foraminotomy.</b> ResultsCervical posterior keyhole <b>foraminotomy</b> (group (2)) had much better results than the cervical anterior discectomy (group (1)). The duration of surgery was shorter in group (2) than in group (1). Also, the postoperative complications including dysphagia, hemiparesis and myelopathy were present only in group (1). The postoperative improvement was better in group (2) than in group (1) and the postoperative hospital stay was shorter in group (2) than in group (1). ConclusionAs compared to cervical anterior discectomy, cervical posterior keyhole <b>foraminotomy</b> is a safe and effective approach for surgical treatment of posterolateral cervical disc prolapse causing nerve root compression resulting in brachialgia. Cervical keyhole <b>foraminotomy</b> has a shorter duration of surgery, less incidence of complications, less duration of postoperative hospital stay and a better improvement in symptoms...|$|E

After surgery, muscle weakness in his both deltoid and biceps was detected and gradually deteriorated to complete paralysis. Postoperative MRI showed sufficient decompression of the spinal cord and posterior shifting. Subsequently, an additional bilateral <b>foraminotomy</b> at C 4 / 5 was performed, with a suspicion that bilateral foraminal stenosis at C 4 / 5 {{may have been the}} cause of the paresis.

40|$|Though a {{possible}} cause of late neurological deficits after posterior cervical reconstruction surgery {{was reported to}} be an iatrogenic foraminal stenosis caused not by implant malposition but probably by posterior shift of the lateral mass induced by tightening screws and plates, its clinical features and pathomechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this retrospective clinical review was to investigate the clinical features of these neurological complications and to analyze the pathomechanisms by reviewing pre- and post-operative imaging studies. Among 227 patients who underwent cervical stabilization using cervical pedicle screws (CPSs), six patients who underwent correction of cervical kyphosis showed postoperative late neurological complications without any malposition of CPS (ND group). The clinical courses of the patients with deficits were reviewed from the medical records. Radiographic assessment of the sagittal alignment was conducted using lateral radiographs. The diameter of the neural foramen was measured on preoperative CT images. These results were compared with the other 14 patients who underwent correction of cervical kyphosis without late postoperative neurological complications (non-ND group). The six patients in the ND group showed no deficits in the immediate postoperative periods, but unilateral muscle weakness of the deltoid and biceps brachii occurred at 2. 8  days postoperatively on average. Preoperative sagittal alignment of fusion area showed significant kyphosis in the ND group. The average of kyphosis correction in the ND was 17. 6 ° per fused segment (range 9. 7 °– 35. 0 °), and 4. 5 ° (range 1. 3 °– 10. 0 °) in the non-ND group. A statistically significant difference was observed in the degree of preoperative kyphosis and the correction angles at C 4 – 5 between the two groups. The diameter of the C 4 – 5 foramen on the side of deficits was significantly smaller than that of the opposite side in the ND group. Late postoperative neurological complications after correction of cervical kyphosis were highly associated with a large amount of kyphosis correction, which may lead foraminal stenosis and enhance posterior drift of the spinal cord. These factors may lead to both compression and traction of the nerves, which eventually cause late neurological deficits. To avoid such complications, excessive kyphosis correction should not be performed during posterior surgery to avoid significant posterior shift of the spinal cord and prophylactic <b>foraminotomies</b> are recommended if narrow neuroforamina were evident on preoperative CT images. Regardless of revision decompression or observation, the majority of this late neurological complication showed complete recovery over time...|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{decompression}} for cervical radiculopathy includes anterior cervical dis-cectomy and fusion, anterior or posterior cervical <b>foraminotomy,</b> and cervical arthro-plasty after decompression. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the usefulness of a CO 2 laser in posterior-approach surgery for unilateral cervical radiculopathy. From January 2006 to December 2008, 12 consecutive patients with unilateral cervical radi-culopathy from either foraminal stenosis or disc herniation, which was confirmed with imaging studies, underwent posterior <b>foraminotomy</b> and discectomy with the use of a microscope and CO 2 laser. For annulotomy and discectomy, we used about 300 joules of CO 2 laser energy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate the extent of disc removal or foraminal decompression. Clinical outcome was evaluated by using visual analogue scale scores for radicular pain and Odom’s criteria. For evaluation of spinal stability, cervical flexion and extension radiographs were obtained.

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{analysis of the}} first twenty patients operated for cervical radiculopathy by a new modification of transcorporeal anterior cervical <b>foraminotomy</b> technique. To evaluate early results of a functional disc surgery in which decompression for the cervical radiculopathy is done by drilling {{a hole in the}} upper vertebral body and most of the disc tissue is preserved. Earlier approaches to cervical disc surgery either advocated simple discectomy or discectomy with fusion, ultimately leading to loss of motion segment. Posterior <b>foraminotomy</b> does not address the more common anterior lesion. Twenty patients suffering from cervical radiculopathy not responding to conservative treatment were chosen for the new technique. Upper vertebral transcorporeal <b>foraminotomy</b> was performed with the modified technique in all the patients. All the patients experienced immediate/early relief of symptoms. No complications of vertebral artery injury, Horner’s syndrome or recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy were noted. Modified transcorporeal anterior cervical microforaminotomy is an effective treatment for cervical radiculopathy. It avoids unnecessary violation of the disc space and much of the bony stabilizers of the cervical spine. Short-term results of this technique are quite encouraging.

40|$|Background: Cervical radiculopathy {{caused by}} spondylotic {{foraminal}} stenosis may require surgical treatment. Surgical options include anterior cervical <b>foraminotomy</b> and fusion or posterior cervical <b>foraminotomy.</b> Controversy remains regarding the preferable surgical approach. Pertinent clinical evidence {{is limited to}} low-quality observational reports. Therefore, treatment decisions are predominantly based on the individual surgeon’s preference and skill. The study objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of posterior <b>foraminotomy</b> in comparison to anterior <b>foraminotomy</b> with fusion {{for the treatment of}} spondylotic foraminal stenosis. Methods/design: This is a multicenter randomized, controlled, parallel group superiority trial. A total of 88 adult patients are allocated in a ratio of 1 : 1. Sample size and power calculations were performed to detect the minimal clinically important difference of 14 points, with an expected standard deviation of 20 in the primary outcome parameter, Neck Disability Index, with a power of 80 %, based on an assumed maximal dropout rate of 20 %. Secondary outcome parameters include the Core Outcome Measures Index, which investigates pain, back-specific function, work disability, social disability and patient satisfaction. Changes in physical and mental health are evaluated using the Short Form- 12 (SF- 12) questionnaire. Moreover, radiological and health economic outcomes are evaluated. Follow-up is performed 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60  months after surgery. Major inclusion criteria are cervical spondylotic foraminal stenosis causing radiculopathy of C 5, C 6 or C 7 and requiring decompression of one or two neuroforaminae. Study data generation (study sites) and data storage, processing and statistical analysis (Department of Medical Statistics, Informatics and Health Economics) are clearly separated. Data will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Discussion: The results of the ForaC study will provide surgical treatment recommendations for spondylotic foraminal stenosis and will contribute to the understanding of its short- and long-term clinical and radiological postoperative course. This will hopefully translate into improvements in surgical treatment and thus, clinical practice for spondylotic foraminal stenosis.

The highlight of our PCIF technique is the use of inclinatory drilling out for preserving more of facet joint. The operative indications are radiculopathy from cervical foraminal stenosis (single or multilevel) with persistent or recurrent root symptoms. The PCIFs were performed between April 2007 and December 2009 on 26 male and 8 female patients with a total of 55 spinal levels. Complete and partial improvement in radiculopathic pain were seen in 26 patients (76 %), and 8 patients (24 %), respectively, with preserving more of facet joint. We believe that PCIF allows for preserving more of the facet joint and capsule when decompressing cervical foraminal stenosis due to spondylosis. We suggest that our PCIF technique can be an effective alternative surgical approach in the management of cervical spondylotic radiculopathy...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to use different segments of the cervical spine in cadavers to determine how much lateral mass should be resected for adequate foraminal decompression. METHODS: Six cadavers were used. The region of the cervical spine from C 1 to the C 7 -T 1 transition was dissected and exposed. The lateral mass of each vertebra was measured bilaterally before the <b>foraminotomy</b> in the following segments: C 2 -C 3, C 3 -C 4, C 4 -C 5, C 5 -C 6 and C 6 -C 7. The procedure was performed with a high-speed drill and through surgical microscopy. Three foraminotomies were performed (F 1, F 2, F 3) in each level. Lateral masses were measured after <b>foraminotomy</b> procedures and compared to the initial measurement, creating a percentage of lateral mass needed for decompression [...] The value of the entire surface was defined as 100 %. RESULTS: There was a statistical difference between the amounts of the resected lateral mass through each <b>foraminotomy</b> (F 1, F 2, F 3) at the same level. However, there was no statistical significant difference among the different levels. The average percentage of resection of the lateral masses in F 2 were 27. 7 % at C 2 -C 3, 24. 8 % at C 3 -C 4, 24. 4 % at C 4 -C 5 and 23. 8 % and 31. 2 % at C 5 -C 6 and C 6 -C 7, respectively. In F 3, the level that needed greater resection of the lateral masses was C 6 -C 7 level, where the average resection ranged between 41. 2 % and 47. 9 %. CONCLUSION: In all segments studied, the removal of approximately 24 to 32 % of the facet joint allowed adequate exposure of the foraminal segment, with visualization of the dural sac and the exit of the cervical root...|$|E
40|$|Thoracic disc {{herniation}} is {{a relatively}} rare yet challenging-to-diagnose condition. Currently there is no universally accepted optimal surgical treatment for symptomatic thoracic disc herniation. Previously reported surgical approaches are often associated with high complication rates. Here we describe our minimally invasive technique of removing thoracic disc herniation, and report the primary results {{of a series of}} cases. Between January 2009 and March 2012, 13 patients with symptomatic thoracic disc herniation were treated with endoscopic thoracic <b>foraminotomy</b> and discectomy under local anesthesia. A bone shaver was used to undercut the facet and rib head for <b>foraminotomy.</b> Discectomy was achieved by using grasper, radiofrequency, and the Holmium-YAG laser. We analyzed the clinical outcomes of the patients using the visual analogue scale (VAS), MacNab classification, and Oswestry disability index (ODI). At the final follow up (mean: 17 months; range: 6 – 41 months), patient self-reported satisfactory rate was 76. 9 %. The mean VAS for mid back pain was improved from 9. 1 to 4. 2, and the mean ODI was improved from 61. 0 to 43. 8. One complication of postoperative spinal headache occurred during the surgery and the patient was successfully treated with epidural blood patch. No other complications were observed or reported during and after the surgery...|$|E
40|$|A 10 -year-old Domestic Shorthair cat was {{admitted}} for chronic ambulatory paraparesis and a spinal malformation. The clinical examination revealed paraparesis accentuated {{on the left}} side. Thoracolumbar radiographs revealed a spinal malformation with a narrowed intervertebral space between L 1 and L 2, and a dorsal fusion {{at the level of}} L 2 -L 3 with a common dorsal process. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an intervertebral disk herniation with a ventral compression of the spinal cord at the level of L 1 / 2. A standard vertebral lateral corpectomy with a <b>foraminotomy</b> was performed with a good outcome...|$|E
40|$|Posterior laminoforaminotomy is a {{well-established}} tech-nique for cervical radiculopathy, first {{described in the}} mid- 20 th century by Spurling and Scoville, 1 and soon after by Frykholm. 2 For over five decades, the traditional posterior <b>foraminotomy</b> relied on an open “keyhole ” approach performed through a midline incision. In 2001, Adamson published the first report of microendoscopic laminoforami-notomy. 3 Since then, multiple reports of similar procedures have been published. 4 – 11 Percutaneous laminoforaminotomy is appealing due to a smaller incision size and presumed benefits in blood loss, hospital stay, and pain medication use. However, percutaneous procedures may also be associated with longer surgical time, increased risk of intraoperative and postoperative complications, and a longer surgeon learn-ing curve. 1...|$|E
30|$|A 42 -year-old {{man who was}} a desk worker had {{degenerative}} cervical spondylosis with C 7 radiculopathy. He had neck pain, {{left shoulder}} stiffness and radicular pain of left arm and had experienced sleep disturbance for 6  years. He was medicated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In the 2  years prior to surgery the patient had received modified satellite ganglion block 10 times, but had progressively worsening symptoms. Selective C 7 root block was performed for both diagnosis and treatment and caused reproducible pain and reduced the pain level. The patient underwent cervical <b>foraminotomy</b> (C 7) under microscopy under the diagnosis made both by root block and 3 D MR/CT fusion imaging. After surgery, he returned to health and the pain disappeared (Figure  4).|$|E
