40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a task-based method for designing underactuated multi-joint prosthetic hands for specific grasping tasks. The designed robotic hands or prosthetic hands contain fewer independent actuators than joints.

The information was used for the synthesis of dedicated underactuated mechanisms that can operate in a low dimensional task coordinate space. We propose two methods for reducing the actuators' number. The kinematic parameters of the synthesized mechanism are determined by using a numerical approach. In this study the joint angles of the synthesized hand are considered as linearly dependent on the displacements of the actuators. We introduced a special error index that allowed us to compare the original trajectory and the trajectory performed by the synthesized mechanism, and to select the kinematic parameters of the new kinematic structure as a way to reduce the error.

40|$|The work {{presented}} here addressed {{the development of}} an electro-mechanical force-feedback device to provide more realistic and complete sensations to a laparoscopic surgery simulator than currently available. A survey of the issues surrounding haptic (touch) displays and training for laparoscopic or "keyhole" procedures was performed. A number of primary and secondary sources including surgeon consultation, operating room observations, and task analyses were used to accumulate a list of needs. Subsequent requirements analysis translated these into a set of specifications for the kinematics, dynamics and actuators, and configuration of the device. These suggested a design with five actuated axes (pitch and yaw about the entrance to the abdomen, insertion, rotation about the tool axis, and gripper feedback) amenable to a configuration including two actuated tools in a lifelike torso. These specifications were the basis for the generation and selection of design concepts. The PHANTOM haptic interface from Sensable Devices was chosen from among a number of existing devices and original designs to actuate the pitch, yaw, and insertion degrees of freedom. A separate end effector actuator was specified to supply feedback to the handle rotation and <b>gripper.</b> <b>Mechanisms</b> were proposed for each of these axes; a linear cable capstan was selected for the gripper and a cable capstan/drum for the rotation.

40|$|Grasping <b>mechanisms</b> (<b>grippers)</b> {{are used}} {{for a wide range}} of {{applications}} including fixturing arrangements, industrial, agricultural, and service robotics for medical and home use.

The grasp model includes kinematic, dynamic and contact models, where the last define the coupling between the contact forces and their deformations [4].

The present paper will report some results on friction of the wire rope under high compressive load on some cases such as under lubricated condition and under different contact conditions using three types of wire rope with steel core, fiber core and a galvanized rope with fiber core. As the results, the difference of contact area between the wire rope and gripper greatly affects the friction behavior; that is, the gripper with a curved surface can bring large friction force comparing with the gripper with a flat surface owing to its large real contact area, which is dominated by a restriction of the escape of wire between gripper surfaces and the deformation of a rope and a core...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to design and develope a Pick and Position system to displace spherical-shaped fruits, with minimum damage to flesh, from one specific place to another. A mechanical gripper (end-effector) suitable for grasping spherical-shaped fruits with 5 - 9 cm in diameter was designed and developed. The primary goal of the gripper design was to take and release the fruit without bruising it in a specified time sequence. A slider-crank mechanism was used to drive the gripper. To achieve suitable timing in gripping and releasing of the fruit, the slider was driven by a cam. The kinematic and dynamic analysis of the gripping unit was done and its motion was simulated using Working Modwl software. In the next step, a four-bar mechanism (arm) was designed and developed to displace gripper between two specified locations. After kinematic analysis, equation of motion of the arm mechanism was derived and its dynamic analysis was performed. The gripper was assembled on the arm mechanism and the performance of the <b>gripper</b> and arm <b>mechanism</b> was investigated.

40|$|An alloy with {{shape memory}} remembers shapes that were {{impressed}} before, can assume them by alternate heating and cooling, and can thus perform mechanical work. The change of shape may amount to 4. 5 %. The present work deals with investigations on electro-mechanical properties of different shape memory alloys (SMA) consisting of NiTi and influenced by electrically generated heat. The shape may alter then within 0. 1 s when current and voltage are controlled. Because the Ohm resistance of SMA depends linearly on the alteration of shape, {{it can be}} integrated as a control variable into a control loop and enable SMA drives to reach and hold positions exactly without the need of displacement sensors. A PID-control unit affords positioning times of about 0. 3 s. Modeling the static and dynamic behaviour of electric SMA drives is based - contrary to the former modeling concepts - on the experimental investigations of comparison data sets with an average load of 100 N/mm" 2. The SMA wire temperatue is calculated from the known data of the comparison set. This may be done by means of emitting heat (convection or radiation) and can thus be approximately calculated with quadratic polynomials. Adjusting the comparison data set to the given peripheral conditions and to the load leads to the static and dynamic behaviour in question - also when passing the hysteresis.

40|$|Two inverse {{problems}} in elasticity are addressed with motivation from cellular biomechanics. The first application is computation of holding forces {{on a cell}} during its manipulation and the second application is estimation of a cell’s interior elastic mapping (i. e., estimation of inhomogeneous distribution of stiffness) using only boundary forces and displacements. It is clear from recent works that mechanical forces {{can play an important}} role in developmental biology. In this regard, we have developed a vision-based force-sensing technique to estimate forces that are acting on a cell while it is manipulated. This problem is connected to one inverse problem in elasticity known as Cauchy’s problem in elasticity. Geometric nonlinearity under noisy displacement data is accounted while developing the solution procedures for Cauchy’s problem. We have presented solution procedures to the Cauchy’s problem under noisy displacement data. Geometric nonlinearity is also considered in order to account large deformations that the <b>mechanisms</b> (<b>grippers)</b> undergo during the manipulation. The second inverse problem is connected to elastic mapping of the cell. We note that recent works in biomechanics have shown that the disease state can alter the gross stiffness of a cell. Therefore, the pertinent question that one can ask is that which portion (for example Nucleus, cortex, ER) of the elastic property of the cell is majorly altered by the disease state. Mathematically, this question (estimation of inhomogeneous properties of cell) can be answered by solving an inverse elastic boundary value problem using sets of force-displacements boundary measurements. We address the theoretical question of number of boundary data sets required to solve the inverse boundary value problem...|$|R

40|$|Liquid crystal {{elastomers}} (LCEs) are a {{class of}} polymer networks which involve the incorporation of liquid crystal (LC) molecules into their polymer backbone or side chain. This results in anisotropy in their mechanical, optical, and electromagnetic properties similar to those exhibited by traditional LC materials. 	Their mechanical properties are highly coupled to the internal state of LC order, which can result in large mechanical deformations as LC order changes. This can occur {{in response to a}} variety of external stimuli such as changes in temperature, exposure to light, and application of external fields. The interplay between LC order and mechanical properties makes LCEs a highly promising class of functional materials and subsequently, they {{have been the subject of}} much research over the past several decades. However, developing an application of LCEs remains difficult in that their mechanical response is both complex and coupled to the state of liquid crystal order prior to cross-linking. Their physics are sufficiently complicated that in most cases, the use of pen-and-paper analysis is precluded. Additionally, the LCE fabrication process is complex and expensive, making trial-and-error experimental design methods unsuitable. This motivates the development and use of simulation-based methods to augment traditional experimental design methods. The two main contributors to the complexity of the design of LCE applications are the choice and imposition of liquid crystal order, or "texture", prior to cross-linking. In this work, simulation-based methods are developed and partially validated for use in applications-focused design of temperature-responsive nematic LCEs. These methods enable the simulation of LCEs of macroscopic size and of non-trivial geometry through the use of continuum mechanics and suitable numerical methods (the finite element method). LC texture is an input parameter in the presented method, allowing many choices of texture to be explored at low cost given that the textures are physically accessible. In addition to methods development and validation results, proof-of-concept simulation-based design studies were performed for two types of LCE-based actuators that are of current interest in the field: <b>grippers</b> and hinge <b>mechanisms.</b> Finally, preliminary results are presented resulting from the integration of nematic texture dynamics simulation (pre-cross-linking) and LCE mechanical simulations (post-cross-linking) which address the two main sources of complexity in the design process of LCE functional materials...|$|R
40|$|Miniature {{compliant}} grippers {{are designed}} and developed to manipulate biological cells and characterize them. Apart from <b>grippers,</b> other compliant <b>mechanisms</b> are also demonstrated {{to be effective}} in manipulation and characterization. Although scalability and force-sensing capability are inherent to a compliant mechanism, it is important to design a compliant mechanism for a given application. Two techniques based on Spring-lever models and kinetoelastostatic maps are developed and used for designing compliant devices. The kinetoelastostatic maps-based technique is a novel approach in designing a mechanism of a given topology and shape. It is also demonstrated that these techniques can be used to tune the stiffness of a mechanism for a given application. In situations where any single mechanism is incapable of executing a specific task, two or more mechanisms are combined into a single continuum with enhanced functionality. This has led to designs of composite compliant mechanisms. Biological cells are manipulated using compliant grippers in order to study their mechanical responses. Biological cells whose size varies from 1 mm (a large zebrafish embryo) to 10 µm (human liver cells), and which require the grippers to resolve forces ranging from 1 mN (zebrafish embryo) to 10 nN (human cells), are manipulated. In addition to biological cells, in some special cases such as tissue-cutting and cement-testing, inanimate specimens are used to highlight specific features of compliant mechanisms. Two extreme cases of manipulation are carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of the design techniques. They are: (i) breaking a stiff cement specimen of stiffness 250 kN/m (ii) gentle grasping of a soft zebrafish embryo of stiffness 10 N/m. Apart from manipulation, wherever it is viable, the mechanisms are interfaced with a haptic device such that the user’s experience of manipulation is enriched with force feedback. An auxiliary study on the characterization of cells is carried out using a micro¬pipette based aspiration technique. Using this technique, cells existing in different conditions such as perfusion, therapeutic medicines, etc., are mechanically characterized. This study is to qualitatively compare aspiration-based techniques with compliant gripper-based manipulation techniques. A compliant gripper-based manipulation technique is beneficial in estimating the bulk stiffness of the cells and can be extended to estimate the distribution of Young’s modulus in the interior. This estimation is carried out by solving an inverse problem. A previously reported scheme to solve over specified boundary conditions of an elastic object—in this case a cell—is improved, and the improved scheme is validated with the help of macro-scale specimens...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mechanical design, analysis, fabrication, and testing procedures {{of a new}} large-range microgripper {{which is based on}} a flexible hinge structure. The uniqueness of the gripper is that the gripper arms not only provide large gripping range but also deliver approximately rectilinear movement as the displacement in nonworking direction is extremely small. The large gripping range is enabled by a mechanism design based on dual-stage flexure amplifier to magnify the stroke of piezoelectric actuator. The first-stage amplifier is {{a modified version of the}} Scott Russell (SR) mechanism and the second-stage amplifier contains a parallel mechanism. The displacement amplification ratio of the modified SR mechanism in the gripper has been enlarged to 3. 56  times of the conventional design. Analytical static models of the <b>gripper</b> <b>mechanism</b> are developed and validated through finite-element analysis (FEA) simulation. Results show that the gripping range is over 720  µm with a resonant frequency of 70. 7  Hz and negligible displacement in nonworking direction. The total amplification ratio of the input displacement is 16. 13. Moreover, a prototype of the gripper is developed by using aluminium 7075 for experimental testing. Experimental results validate the analytical model and FEA simulation results. The proposed microgripper can be employed in various microassembly applications such as pick-and-place of optical fibre...|$|E
40|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is the introduction of three different devices for measuring the flexion of phalangeal articulations. The devices described in the study are suitable for the determination of the active and the functional range of motion (ROM) of finger joints. In the paper, multiple measurements are reported {{in order to determine the}} maximum and minimum values of the active and the functional range of motion of phalangeal articulations and to validate the proper operation of the measurement devices. The first measurement method was based on the post factum image processing of video recordings, while the second and the third method used devices that were attached to the finger and equipped with analogue and digital sensors, which is similar to a miniature goniometer with a computer interface. The results showed that people only use 79 - 82 % of the active range of motion of phalangeal articulations. Additionally, there was a 6 % difference between the current measurement results and the data available from previously reported measurements. The current study also aims at finding the cause of this anomaly. Comparative analysis of the measurement results provides a basis for the future development of an actuator that would be used in a multiple finger <b>gripper</b> <b>mechanism</b> suitable for rehabilitation purposes...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{introduce}} {{the development of a}} control system implemented for a force-feedback <b>gripper</b> <b>mechanism,</b> as well as the results of the experiments carried out on the device. The achievements shall be used in additional research related to medical purpose grippers, such as artificial hands. The aim of the current research is the improvement of the control system of artificial hands in order to assure the expected usability {{in the case of a}} simplified mechanical structure, and eventually to decrease the manufacturing cost of such devices to gain higher availability. First, the main units of the experimental device will be described. After the clarification of the basics, the applied control strategies shall be discussed in detail. From the basic PI/PID control, to adaptive fuzzy/neuro-fuzzy control, different methods are applied also on the simulation model and the experimental device itself. The main results of the research are the summary of differences between the particular control strategies. The properties of the controls, like speed, stability, accuracy and adaptivity are determined and a comparative analysis have been expounded. From the achieved results, the overall efficiency of the different control strategies can be determined, the type and properties of the optimal control can be described. Finally the aspects of further development will be discussed; on one hand, that means the design and production of a new, more complex mechanism; and on the other hand, the feedback of more state variables in order to gain more information for better function. Hopefully a complete five-finger gripper will be manufactured in the near future, and by the time it will be available, the results of this study can be utilized for its control system...|$|E
