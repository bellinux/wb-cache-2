A multi-frequency and multi-segment human bioelectrical impedance measurement method is proposed, which adopts eight electrodes segments measurement technique and direct <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> to produce multi-frequency excitation signal, and then achieves multi-frequency and multi-segment measurement of bioelectrical impedance.

The sound-pressure level and frequency are important factors in propagation growth. In this study, an experimental system of audio generator was developed for investigating sound wave effect on propagation growth promotion, and an embedded development platform based on ARM+DSP+FPGA was built for the system. The DDFS(Direct Digital <b>Frequency</b> <b>Synthesis)</b> <b>method</b> was used to make various waveforms in the system. A feedback analysis networks was added in the system for reliable output of sound waves.

40|$|Restricted until 20 Oct. 2012. The thesis {{presents}} innovative solutions, both system {{level and}} block level, {{for the new}} trends in the wireless devices. Multi-functionality in wireless devices is becoming ever popular. It allows for concurrent and non-concurrent operation of different wireless standards and applications in a single wireless device. Today's mobile phones are not only used for voice communication, but also provide mobile entertainment, digital assistance, navigation and much more. Brute-force techniques to replicate blocks of transceivers for each standard and integrate them is not cost-effective. The thesis provides the implementation and theoretical understanding for multi-frequency blocks, specifically multi-frequency oscillator. A multi-frequency oscillator is capable of producing all the required center frequencies for all the standards either concurrently or non-concurrently. Special case of dual-frequency oscillator is considered which is composed of a single active device and a dual-resonant tank with resonances at f 1 and f 2. Detailed nonlinear analysis is provided to determine the stability of different modes of oscillations, i. e., oscillations at f 1 or at f 2 or simultaneously at f 1 and f 2, in a dual-frequency oscillator. Phase noise in dual-frequency oscillators is analyzed for the first time. Implementation and theory for arrays of multi-frequency oscillators in different configuration is also discussed.; Radio Frequency (RF) sensing and spectral analysis over multi-GHz frequency band benefits a vast range of applications including public safety, electronic warfare, instrumentation, and cognitive radio. Today's solutions require significant reduction in size, weight, and power consumption. For instance, the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Public Safety are interested in dismounted RF sensors from a few kHz to multi GHz that can be hand-carried by their personnel over long distances. Similarly, test and measurement industry is seeing a growing trend towards USB dongle-based instrumentation. A monolithic 100 Hz- 6 GHz CMOS RF vector signal/spectrum analyzer, following a two-step up-down conversion heterodyne scheme with robustness to various wide-band interference scenarios, is presented. The chip enables wireless spectrum analysis in USB-dongle form-factor.; Fast-hopping wideband frequency synthesizer finds it use in applications in secure communication using Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS), electronic warfare where a rapidly hopping signal generator can effectively jam the enemies without getting detected or defeated, and Multi-band Orthogonal Frequency Domain Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) standard where the Local Oscillator (LO) {{must be able to}} hop from one sub-band to another within 10 ns. <b>Frequency</b> <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods</b> using PLL or DDS are either too slow or power hungry, respectively. This thesis provides some of the <b>methods</b> of fast-hopping <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesis</b> that can result a low power and extremely fast <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesis.</b> Particularly, the implementation and design of a highly calibrated wideband VCO that can provide nanosecond fast hopping with fine resolution is discussed in detail...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} results of {{processing}} of data of observations which had been carried out with the VLBA during 10 last years. All the data have been retrieved from archive of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (USA NRAO, Socorro, New Mexico). Particularly, we examine data of VLBA observational sessions titled BK 068, BL 111, BL 137, BL 149, and BD 086. Objects of our interest are near galaxies with z < 0. 02. The radio maps of compact structure around the active galactic nuclei (AGN) reconstructed for two such galaxies (NGC 315 and 3 C 274) in U frequency band (15 GHz) are presented. Some parameters of these sources are shown in Table 1. We have to perform the careful amplitude and phase calibration for all the data. Particularly, a correction of the delay caused by the Earth atmosphere has been made because it is necessary in this frequency range. Bright quasars close to the target sources (for instance, J 0136 + 4751 and 3 C 279 correspondingly) are used as atmosphere calibrators. Secondly, the Multi <b>Frequency</b> <b>Synthesis</b> (MFS) <b>method</b> is used for final maps reconstruction {{as well as for}} estimation of spectral index values of core and jet of AGN of both objects. As a result, we can make some conclusions about the milliarcsecond structure of central regions of sources thanks to the using of these two methods of the VLBA data processing. Moreover, we can reveal some changes of this structure in 1999 - 2009, and estimate roughly the velocities and acceleration/deceleration values for brightest components of the nuclei of NGC 315 and 3 C 274.

30|$|To {{synthesize}} active catalysts with desirable properties, adding {{and mixing}} are main clauses. So, for {{the preparation of}} SAPO- 34 catalysts using ultrasound waves, for avoiding of creating of lumps, 6.5  g boehmite was gradually (approximately 2  h) added to 32.3  g TEAOH and during adding the power for stirring was increased.

Afterwards, 8.9  g of phosphoric acid diluted in 12.7  g of distilled water was added drop-wise; at the end, remaining water {{was added to the}} mixture. The final gel was sonicated in argon flow for 30  min, by an Ultrasonic Homogenizer SONOPLUS HD 2070 (Bandelin) with a frequency of 20  kHz and input power of 70  W. The pH of gel was 7. For preparation of SAPO- 34 catalyst via hydrothermal method, the same components were mixed without using ultrasound <b>frequency.</b> In both <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods,</b> final mixture was transferred into stainless steel autoclaves and heated at 200  °C for 48  h.

30|$|In this study, NiO/SBA- 15 was {{prepared}} by both direct and post <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods.</b> TEM images revealed that NiO particles aggregated in NiO/SBA- 15 obtained with post <b>synthesis</b> <b>method,</b> regardless of NiO loading. However, NiO particles were monodispersed in NiO/SBA- 15 with a NiO loading {{of less than}} 15  wt% by using the direct <b>synthesis</b> <b>method.</b> In this case, NiO particles aggregated when NiO loading was over 20  wt%. TPR analysis verified that with direct <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> the location boundary of NiO particles on outer and pore surface could be observed clearly, whereas that could not observed {{in the case of}} post <b>synthesis</b> <b>method.</b> This indicates that the type of <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> displays significant effect on the location of NiO particles dispersed into the SBA- 15. Producer gas conversion was carried out using NiO/SBA- 15 as catalysts, which were synthesized with different <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods.</b> The gas conversion including methanation occurred at low temperature (i.e., 300 – 400  °C) and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction at high temperature (i.e., 400 – 900  °C). High temperatures facilitated CO 2 conversion to CO with CO selectivity close to 100  %, regardless of the <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> of the used catalyst. At low temperatures the dispersion type of NiO particles affected the CO 2 conversion reaction, i.e., monodispersed NiO particles gave a CO selectivity of close to 100  %, similar to that obtained at high temperature. The aggregated NiO particles resulted in a CO selectivity of less than 100  % owing to CH 4 formation, regardless of <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> of catalyst. Therefore, NiO/SBA- 15 obtained with direct <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> favored RWGS reaction because of high CO selectivity. NiO/SBA- 15 obtained with post <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> is suited for methanation because of high CH 4 selectivity, and the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 through methanation increased with increasing NiO loading.|$|R

Knowledge synthesis activities in healthcare have largely focused on systematic reviews of interventions. However, {{a wider range of}} <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods</b> has emerged in the last decade addressing different types of questions (e. g., realist synthesis to explore mediating mechanisms and moderators of interventions). Many different knowledge <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods</b> exist in the literature across multiple disciplines, but locating these, particularly for qualitative research, present challenges. There is a need for a comprehensive manual for <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods</b> (quantitative/qualitative or mixed), outlining how these methods are related, and how to match the most appropriate knowledge <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> to answer a research question. The objectives of this scoping review are to: 1) conduct a systematic search of the literature for knowledge <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods</b> across multi-disciplinary fields; 2) compare and contrast the different knowledge synthesis methods; and, 3) map out the specific steps to conducting the knowledge syntheses to inform the development of a knowledge <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods</b> manual/tool. Methods We will search relevant electronic databases (e. g., MEDLINE, CINAHL), grey literature, and discipline-based listservs. The scoping review will consider all study designs including qualitative and quantitative methodologies (excluding economic analysis or clinical practice guideline development), and identify knowledge <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods</b> across the disciplines of health, education, sociology, and philosophy.

40|$|Abstract: Several {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} for synthesizing communication protocol specifications starting from given service specifications. Due to the inherently sequential nature of a finite state machine (FSM), some FSM-based protocol <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods</b> assume that primitives in the service specifications cannot be executed simultaneously. However, other <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods</b> were introduced to handle controlled primitive concurrency by imposing restrictions on the applicable FSM topologies. This paper proposes two alternative FSM-based protocol <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods</b> that eliminate the restrictions on concurrency imposed by earlier methods. The first method applies a sequential-based <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> to derive a sequential protocol specification (P-SPEC) from a service specification (S-SPEC) and then applies several state-expansion rules to re-model the resulting P-SPEC to consider the concurrency behavior specified in the S-SPEC. The second method re-models a concurrent S-SPEC into a sequential-like one by expanding its states and applies a sequential-based <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> to derive the concurrent P-SPEC. Thus, the paper’s main contribution is proposing <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods</b> that allow the protocol designers to model their service specifications with concurrency behaviors, using FSM-based models, and to derive, automatically, the corresponding protocol specifications for the concurrently executable protocol entities. The derived protocol specifications are guaranteed {{to be free of}} design errors; therefore, they do not require any further verification. The complexity of the two methods is discussed and their syntactic and semantic correctness are proven. As an example application, the <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> is used to derive the protocol specification of the H. 323 call release standard used in Internet calls...|$|R
