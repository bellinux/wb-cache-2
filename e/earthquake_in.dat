A few damaging <b>earthquakes</b> <b>in</b> the plate boundary regions include the following: 1897 Shillong plateau, 1905 Angora, 1934 Nepal-Briar, 1950 Hassan (now Crunchable), 2004 Sumatra Adamant, 2005 Kashmir and 2015 Gorki <b>earthquakes.</b> <b>In</b> the plate interior regions, damaging <b>earthquakes</b> occurred <b>in</b> 1993 at Millar, in 1997 at Jamal, and in 2001 at BU.|$|R
5|$|Modern {{research}} {{has estimated that}} the quake was between 6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale, and the United States Geological Survey lists it as the largest <b>earthquake</b> <b>in</b> the history of Massachusetts. Scientists are unclear on the causes of this and other quakes in the northeastern United States. There {{are a number of}} old faults in the region, but none of them are known still to be active. It is possible that the Cape Ann earthquake may have been remotely triggered by a larger <b>earthquake</b> <b>in</b> Lisbon, Portugal, a few weeks prior, although there is not enough evidence to prove that they are linked.|$|E

40|$|Source scaling {{relations}} {{have been obtained}} for <b>earthquakes</b> <b>in</b> eastern North America and other continental interiors, and compared with a relation obtained for <b>earthquakes</b> <b>in</b> western North America. The scaling relation for eastern North American earthquakes was constructed from measurements of seismic moment and source duration obtained by the waveform modeling of seismic body waves. The events used include nine events of m_(bLg) magnitude 4. 7 to 5. 8 that occurred after 1960, and four earlier events with magnitudes between 5. 5 and 6. 6. The scaling relation for events in other continental interiors was used for comparative purposes and to provide constraints for large magnitudes. Detailed analysis of the uncertainties in the scaling relations has allowed the resolution of two important issues concerning the source scaling of <b>earthquakes</b> <b>in</b> eastern North America. First, the source characteristics of <b>earthquakes</b> <b>in</b> eastern North America and other continental interiors are consistent with constant stress drop scaling, and are inconsistent with nonconstant scaling models {{such as that of}} Nuttli (1983). Second, the stress drops of <b>earthquakes</b> <b>in</b> eastern North America and other continental interiors are not significantly different from those of <b>earthquakes</b> <b>in</b> western North America, and have median values of approximately 100 bars. The source parameters of <b>earthquakes</b> <b>in</b> eastern North America are consistent with a single constant stress drop scaling relation, whereas the source parameters of <b>earthquakes</b> <b>in</b> western North America are much more variable and show significant departures from an average scaling relation in which stress drop decreases slightly with seismic moment...|$|R

5|$|The gate, {{built of}} large square blocks of {{polished}} white marble fitted together without cement, has {{the form of}} a triumphal arch with three arched gates, the middle one larger than the two others. The gate is flanked by large square towers, which form the 9th and 10th towers of the inner Theodosian wall. With the exception of the central portal, the gate remained open to everyday traffic. The structure was richly decorated with numerous statues, including a statue of Theodosius I on an elephant-drawn quadriga on top, echoing the Porta Triumphalis of Rome, which survived until it fell down in an <b>earthquake</b> <b>in</b> 740. Other sculptures were a large cross, which fell in an <b>earthquake</b> <b>in</b> 561 or 562; a Victory, which was cast down in the reign of Michael III; and a crowned Fortune of the City. In 965, Nikephoros II Phokas installed the captured bronze city gates of Mopsuestia in the place of the original ones.|$|E
