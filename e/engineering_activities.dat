25|$|In 1968, the BUA {{group of}} {{companies}} underwent a major reorganisation to improve its financial performance. This included adoption of a new strategy for BUA that aimed to replace the dwindling number of unprofitable trooping flights with growing engagement in the more rewarding European inclusive tour (IT) and transatlantic affinity group charter markets. It also resulted in relocation of the head office and concentration of <b>engineering</b> <b>activities</b> at Gatwick. Successful implementation of these organisational and strategic changes enabled BUA to make the loss-making South American routes profitable by late-1968 and to become the UK's only profitable mainline scheduled domestic operator by 1969.|$|E
25|$|The {{main reason}} for using {{mathematical}} models and diagrams in trade studies is to provide estimates of system effectiveness, performance or technical attributes, and cost from a set of known or estimable quantities. Typically, a collection of separate models is needed to provide all of these outcome variables. The heart of any mathematical model {{is a set of}} meaningful quantitative relationships among its inputs and outputs. These relationships {{can be as simple as}} adding up constituent quantities to obtain a total, or as complex as a set of differential equations describing the trajectory of a spacecraft in a gravitational field. Ideally, the relationships express causality, not just correlation. Furthermore, key to successful systems <b>engineering</b> <b>activities</b> are also the methods with which these models are efficiently and effectively managed and used to simulate the systems. However, diverse domains often present recurring problems of modeling and simulation for systems engineering, and new advancements are aiming to crossfertilize methods among distinct scientific and engineering communities, under the title of 'Modeling & Simulation-based Systems Engineering'.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} paper creates a comprehensive statistical model, relating financial impact of risk <b>engineering</b> <b>activity,</b> and insurance claims costs. Specifically, the model shows important statistical relationships among six variables including: types of risk <b>engineering</b> <b>activity,</b> risk <b>engineering</b> dollar cost, duration of risk engineering service, {{and type of}} customer by industry classification, dollar premium amounts, and dollar claims costs. We accomplish this by using a large data sample of approximately 15, 000 customer-years of insurance coverage, and risk <b>engineering</b> <b>activity.</b> Data sample is from an international casualty/property insurance company and covers four years of operations, 2006 - 2009.

In June 1851 he was ordered to Fort Delaware, a masonry work under construction on an island in the Delaware River, [...] downriver from Philadelphia. In March 1852 he was ordered to report to Capt. Randolph B. Marcy at Fort Smith, Arkansas, to serve as second-in-command on an expedition to discover the sources of the Red River. By June the expedition reached the source of the north fork of the river and Marcy named a small tributary McClellan's Creek. Upon their return to civilization on July 28, they were astonished to find that they had been given up for dead. A sensational story had reached the press that the expedition had been ambushed by 2,000 Comanches and killed to the last man.

2500|$|Colonizing Mercury {{would involve}} similar {{challenges}} as the Moon {{as there are}} few volatile elements, no atmosphere and the surface gravity is lower than Earth's. However, the planet also receives almost seven times the solar flux as the Earth/Moon system. [...] Geologist Stephen Gillett has suggested this will make Mercury an ideal place to build solar sails, which could launch as folded up [...] "chunks" [...] by mass driver from Mercury's surface. [...] Once in space the solar sails would deploy. Since Mercury's solar constant is 6.5 times higher than Earth's, energy for the mass driver should be easy to come by, and solar sails near Mercury would have 6.5 times the thrust they do near Earth. This could make Mercury an ideal place to acquire materials useful in building hardware to send to (and terraform) Venus. Vast solar collectors could also be built on or near Mercury to produce power for large scale <b>engineering</b> <b>activities</b> such as laser-pushed lightsails to nearby star systems.|$|E
