About 50% of Juniper's revenues are derived from routers, 13% from switches, 12% comes from <b>IT</b> <b>security</b> and 25% from services.|$|E
5|$|Kaspersky {{graduated}} from The Technical Faculty of the KGB Higher School in 1987 {{with a degree}} in mathematical engineering and computer technology. His interest in <b>IT</b> <b>security</b> began when his work computer was infected with the Cascade virus in 1989 and he developed a program to remove it. Kaspersky helped grow Kaspersky Lab through security research and salesmanship. He became the CEO in 2007 and remains so as of 2017.|$|E

5|$|Kaspersky's {{interest}} in <b>IT</b> <b>security</b> began in 1989, when his PC was infected by the Cascade virus, {{while working for}} the Ministry of Defense. He studied how the virus worked and developed a program to remove it. Afterwards he continually found new viruses and developed software to remove them, as a hobby. Early on Kaspersky's anti-virus software had just 40 virus definitions and was distributed mostly to friends.|$|E
5|$|Yevgeny Valentinovich Kaspersky (Russian: Евгений Валентинович Касперский) is a Russian {{cybersecurity}} {{expert and}} the CEO of Kaspersky Lab, an <b>IT</b> <b>security</b> company with 4,000 employees. He cofounded Kaspersky Lab in 1997 and helped identify instances of government-sponsored cyberwarfare {{as the head}} of research. He has been an advocate for an international treaty prohibiting cyberwarfare.|$|E
5|$|As {{the head}} of research, Kaspersky {{authored}} papers on viruses and went to conferences to promote the software. He was often quoted in the technology press as an antivirus expert. He helped establish the company's Global Research and Expert Analysis Team (GReAT), which helps corporations and governments investigate <b>IT</b> <b>security</b> threats. Initially he told his team not to discuss cyber-terrorism publicly, to avoid giving governments {{ideas on how to}} sabotage their political opponents. After the American film Live Free or Die Hard (AKA Die Hard 4.0) (2007) was released, Kaspersky said the idea was now public. He hired the researcher that identified the Stuxnet worm, which {{is believed to be the}} first instance of state-sponsored cyberweapon. Afterwards, the company exposed the Flame virus at the request of the International Telecommunication Union. The virus was believed to have been used for cyber-espionage in Middle-Eastern countries.|$|E

5|$|Juniper Networks {{originally}} {{focused on}} core routers, {{which are used}} by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper Networks entered the <b>IT</b> <b>security</b> market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper {{has been focused on}} developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy for allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.|$|E
