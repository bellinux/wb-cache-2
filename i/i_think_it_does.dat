500|$|Charlie McCollum for the Knight Ridder {{newspapers}} {{said that}} the first half fell flat on promises made to rejuvenate the series, adding that [...] "Storm Front" [...] represented [...] "a confusing premise, flat production and recycled stories." [...] Jamahl Epsicokhan, at his website Jammer's Reviews, gave both parts {{two and a half}} out of four stars. He wrote that the episode [...] "inherits so much nonsensical time-travel baggage from previous episodes (including last season's final 60 seconds) that the premise is all but indefensible" [...] and ultimately the episode [...] "breaks down the entire temporal war (at least <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does)</b> to a single battle in Earth's past, that revolves around a single sci-fi MacGuffin: Vosk's conduit that the Nazis are constructing for him." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Redux" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Todd VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, awarded {{the first episode}} a C+ rating and wrote that [...] "'Redux ' {{was a pretty good}} episode back in 1997. It’s not a very good episode now". VanDerWerff noted that the idea that Mulder had killed himself was not effective because the show's audience knew that a movie had been scheduled for release in the summer of 1998. Finally, he called the episode's ending [...] "one of the show’s weaker cliffhangers". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave {{the first part of the}} episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She heavily criticized the story's pacing, noting that the episode [...] "is all plot, plot, plot. [...] much of the plot is unbelievable." [...] Furthermore, Vitaris criticized several plot holes in the episode, including Mulder's easy entrance into the Department of Defense and the characters antics, such as his attack of Ostelhoff. However, despite the overall negative review, Vitaris did mention that, [...] "There's only one truly galvanizing scene, as that's the confrontation between Scully and Skinner after he follows her to the lab where she is performing her DNA test." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two heavily criticized the [...] "Skinner-as-traitor" [...] plot, noting sardonically that [...] "the production team aren't going to do , and the shock 'villain in the room' reveal will be Section Chief Blevins–a character so important in the framework of the series that, barring his appearance in the Season Four finale, we haven't seen him in ninety-four episodes." [...] Not all reviews were so negative. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files named [...] "Redux" [...] and [...] "Redux II", together, as the tenth best [...] "Episode of All Time". In his critique of [...] "Redux", he noted [...] "While many people don't care for 'Redux', <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> a good job of preparing us for the second hour (although, it invalidates Gillian's emotional context from the S4 finale)." [...] In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Redux" [...] (along with [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and [...] "Redux II") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E
2500|$|In September 2002, Tony Blair stated, in {{an answer}} to a {{parliamentary}} question, that [...] "Regime change in Iraq would be a wonderful thing. That is not the purpose of our action; our purpose is to disarm Iraq {{of weapons of mass}} destruction..." [...] In November of that year, Blair further stated that, [...] "So far as our objective, it is disarmament, not régime change – that is our objective. Now I happen to believe the regime of Saddam is a very brutal and repressive regime, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> enormous damage to the Iraqi people ... so I have got no doubt Saddam is very bad for Iraq, {{but on the other hand}} I have got no doubt either that the purpose of our challenge from the United Nations is disarmament of weapons of mass destruction, it is not regime change." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nick Monson {{booked a}} two-hour session with songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter to adjust {{one of their}} compositions. Finishing the {{adjustment}} in 45 minutes, they {{decided to use the}} remaining time to write another song so that they would not waste the money for the studio time they paid for. [...] "Good for You" [...] was subsequently written in 45 minutes. It began with Monson playing its bassline and putting a snap on it before Michaels freestyled the opening lyric, [...] "I'm on my 14 carats". Her lyrics were influenced by her boyfriend who told her, [...] "Julia, you never write any happy songs for me. It's kind of sad," [...] to which she responded: [...] "Fine, I'll write a good song about you, shut up!". Tranter's lyrics were inspired by his ex-boyfriend who preferred him to dress femme. Upon hearing [...] "Good for You", the trio's A told them that the song should be recorded by Selena Gomez, despite Tranter initially thinking the song was [...] "too indie" [...] for her. The A sent the track to the singer who [...] "freaked out", deeming it the artistic direction she had envisioned for her second studio album, Revival (2015). She described the song as [...] "a piece that was just everything I feel a woman should embody, but not in the obvious way" [...] and explained to iHeartRadio: [...] "I think it just sets the tone perfect for the record just because it's sexy, but not trying too hard. The track and everything kind of does it itself. It's sensual, it reps women in a good way. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> something to a woman when they look good".|$|E
6000|$|... "Like the moon?--well; I fancy I {{like the}} sun better. I don't quite believe in moonlight. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> best to talk about when {{one wants to be}} sentimental." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have read}} {{a good deal}} of Mr. Hayward's version, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> in a very manly style; but I do not admit the {{argument}} for prose translations.

60|$|Poppy didn't die, {{though she}} got all ready for it; and felt rather {{disappointed}} when the foot healed, the jaws remained as active as ever, and the fits didn't come. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> her good; for she never forgot that week, and, {{though she was}} near dying several times after, she never was so fit to go as she was then.|$|R

6000|$|But what do I mean by that? That {{ought to}} depend on what Moses meant by it. Moses meant what God meant, and unless I mean the same thing I must mean {{something}} wrong. And this is what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> mean: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR MR. MANNING,--I {{find it very}} {{difficult}} to answer your letter.

[...] Barry added details about Robin's struggle losing his brother Maurice a decade earlier.

60|$|Do {{you think}} that some artists of merit have been excluded, or that artists whom you think not deserving of that honor have been elected?--More; that artists not deserving of the honor have been elected. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> no harm to any {{promising}} artist {{to be left out}} of the Academy, but it does harm to the public sometimes that an unpromising artist should be let into it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{has been}} blessed to you,' said Albinia, affectionately. 'My dear, we always thought your {{character}} one that wanted the softening of such--an attachment. Perhaps {{that made me}} wrongly eager for it, and ready to imagine where I ought not; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> soften you; {{but if you had}} not conquered what was earthly and exaggerated in it, how it would be hardening and poisoning you now!' ...|$|R

The first thing, of course, will be to get some wood and char it. I should think that you would require at least two pounds of that to two pounds of powder; but you had better only do a little at first--just enough to make an experiment. You know it will require ramming down well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was waiting}} for you," [...] said she. [...] "I {{wanted to see how}} that hat fitted, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> nicely. And I wanted to tell you that I have been looking out for ships, but have not seen one. I don't mean by that that I want you to go away almost as soon as you have come, but of course, if a {{merchant}} ship should anchor here, it would be dreadful for you not to know." ...|$|E
6000|$|Of the {{pathological}} bearings of {{the study}} of yeast, and other such organisms, I have spoken elsewhere. It is certain that, in some animals, devastating epidemics are caused by fungi of low order--similar to those of which Torula is a sort of offshoot. It is certain that such diseases are propagated by contagion and infection, in just the same way as ordinary contagious and infectious diseases are propagated. Of course, it does not follow from this, that all contagious and infectious diseases are caused by organisms of as definite and independent a character as the Torula; but, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> follow that it is prudent and wise to satisfy one's self in each particular case, that the [...] "germ theory" [...] cannot and will not explain the facts, before having recourse to hypotheses which have no equal support from analogy.|$|E

One feels confident; there are better jobs, and perhaps one is not forced to be poor always. Anyhow, Betty didn't bother about the pay; she can go without things, but when I tried to persuade her she was firm. Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> <b>done</b> with, she won't marry me.

Do you know, I get so immoderately sick of Bath; your brother and I were agreeing this morning that, though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks, we would not live here for millions. We soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place; really, our {{opinions}} were so exactly the same, it was quite ridiculous! There was not a single point in which we differed; I would not have had you by for the world; you are such a sly thing, I am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thou art beyond {{question}} an unbeliever, {{and therefore}} thou wilt be damned. So says my Law--or <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does.</b> But thou art also my Little Friend {{of all the}} World, and I love thee. So says my heart. This matter of creeds is like horseflesh. The wise man knows horses are good--that there is a profit to be made from all; and for myself--but that I am a good Sunni and hate the men of Tirah--I could believe the same of all the Faiths. Now manifestly a Kathiawar mare taken from the sands of her birthplace and removed {{to the west of}} Bengal founders--nor is even a Balkh stallion (and there are no better horses than those of Balkh, were they not so heavy in the shoulder) of any account in the great Northern deserts beside the snow-camels I have seen. Therefore I say in my heart the Faiths are like the horses. Each has merit in its own country.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR HARRY,--You {{will be much}} {{surprised}} at receiving a letter from me so soon after our meeting last night. But I warn you that you must not take it amiss.

I do not write to say a word about my love, of which I think you may be assured without any letter. I told mamma last night what had occurred between us, and she of course was very angry. You will understand that, knowing how anxious she has been on behalf of my cousin Mountjoy.
