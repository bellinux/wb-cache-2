25|$|The Typhoon {{features}} a glass cockpit without any conventional instruments. It incorporates three full colour multi-function head-down displays (MHDDs) (the formats on which are manipulated {{by means of}} softkeys, XY cursor, and voice (Direct Voice Input or DVI) command), a wide angle head-up display (HUD) with forward-looking infrared (FLIR), a voice and hands-on throttle and stick (Voice+HOTAS), a Helmet Mounted Symbology System (HMSS), a Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS), a manual data-entry facility (MDEF) located on the left <b>glareshield</b> and a fully integrated aircraft warning system with a dedicated warnings panel (DWP). Reversionary flying instruments, lit by LEDs, are located under a hinged right <b>glareshield.</b> Access to the cockpit is normally via either a telescopic integral ladder or an external version. The integral ladder is stowed in the port side of the fuselage, below the cockpit.|$|E
2500|$|Most 737 cockpits are {{equipped}} with [...] "eyebrow windows" [...] positioned above the main <b>glareshield.</b> Eyebrow windows were {{a feature of the}} original 707 and 727. They allowed for greater visibility in turns, and offered better sky views if navigating by stars. With modern avionics, they became redundant, and many pilots actually placed newspapers or other objects in them to block out sun glare. They were eliminated from the 737 cockpit design in 2004, although they are still installed at customer request. These windows are sometimes removed and plugged, usually during maintenance overhauls, and can be distinguished by the metal plug which differs from the smooth metal in later aircraft that were not originally fitted with the windows.|$|E

50|$|Triumph Composite Systems in Spokane, Washington {{manufactures}} composite interior components {{ranging from}} cargo and commercial floor panels to environmental control system (ECS) ducting. The organization also produces dripshields, <b>glareshields,</b> aisle stands, side-wall risers and mix bay manifolds.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{equipped}} with BAE Systems active sidesticks, appearing to be mechanically linked by being electrically back-driven, the first civil aircraft to be so. The Honeywell Symmetry Flight Deck features four portrait main displays, three touchscreens on the overhead panel instead of stand-alone switches there are four touchscreens in the <b>glareshield</b> and left and right touch standby displays at each seat. The enhanced flight vision system is displayed through 42×30° field-of-view head-up display, along a complete avionics suite.|$|E
5000|$|The {{layout of}} control panels in modern airliners has become largely unified across the industry. The {{majority}} of the systems-related controls (such as electrical, fuel, hydraulics and pressurization) for example, are usually located in the ceiling on an overhead panel. Radios are generally placed on a panel between the pilot's seats known as the pedestal. Automatic flight controls such as the autopilot are usually placed just below the windscreen and above the main instrument panel on the <b>glareshield.</b> A central concept {{in the design of}} the cockpit is the Design Eye Position or [...] "DEP", from which point all displays should be visible.|$|E

40|$|Current {{research}} investigates automation feedback design {{compared with}} a potential design solution that may increase pilot’s situation awareness of the Flight Mode Annunciators (FMAs) to reduce pilot workload and improve human-automation coordination. The research tools include an Eye Tracker and B 747 flight simulator. This research evaluated two types of FMAs; a proposed <b>glareshield</b> mounted FMAs against the baseline FMA design mounted on the Primary Flight Display using an objective eye tracker. There are 19 participants including professional and private pilots and aerospace engineers. The results suggest that proposed <b>glareshield</b> design is the better design compared with the baseline design which demonstrated larger mean pupil sizes related to the higher workload. A design solution was proposed that moved the FMAs to a MCP position, taking into account EASA and FAA design guidance, {{as well as several}} design principles including positioning to increase salience and the proximity compatibility principle. The results of the experiment found that FMAs on the MCP could increase pilot SA and reduced the mean fixation duration compared to the PFD position. Although the study used a small sample size, it demonstrates the value of further research to evaluate the proposed design...|$|E
