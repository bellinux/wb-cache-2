40|$|Electrostatic {{filtration}} media (electret) {{has been used}} in many applications due to its ability to efficiently collect submicron particles while maintaining a low pressure drop. Filter face velocities have ranged from 0. 01 - 0. 5 m/s in previous studies. However, in this study, measurements were conducted from 0. 5 - 2. 5 m/s, a region where Reynolds numbers range from 0. 05 - 0. 24. Within this regime, commonly used filtration theory is incomplete and does not predict performance of electret media, therefore data must be measured. Experimental measurements were conducted in various combinations of charge and neutralized filter media with aerosolized particles possessing the Boltzmann charge distribution or zero charge. Collection efficiency of the charged FiltreteTM media was significantly higher than the FiltreteTM which had been charged neutralized. As <b>filter</b> <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> increased, however, collection efficiency decreased in the electret media. As <b>filter</b> <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> increased for the neutralized media, collection efficiency increased due to inertial impaction. Particle bounce was assumed to occur with particles of aerodynamic diameter ≥ 400 nm. Electrostatic attraction, i. e. Coulombic, polarization and image forces were analyzed based on experimental data. The Coulombic force had the greatest effect on efficiency at all three filter face velocities, followed by the polarization force. The effect of image forces was negligible for all three filter face velocities. This study provides unique empirical data outside of the viscous filter flow regime, data which is useful in the design of, and performance prediction of, high volume commercial and industrial applications, such as HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems. The data presented can be used to “validate” numerical models for filtration at moderate Reynolds numbers where data is scarce for electrostatically charged filtration.

In this paper, we theoretically investigate the QF of dual-layer filters for filtration of monodisperse and polydisperse nanoparticles. The inverse problem of air filtration, as defined in this work, consists in determining the optimal construction of the two-layer fibrous filter with the maximum QF. In comparison to a single-layer substrate, improved QF values for dual-layer filters are found when a second layer with proper structural parameters is added. The influences of solidity, fiber diameter, <b>filter</b> thickness, <b>face</b> <b>velocity,</b> and particle size on the optimization of QF are studied. The maximum QF values for realistic polydisperse particles with a lognormal size distribution are also found. Furthermore, we propose a modified QF (MQF) accounting {{for the effects of}} energy cost and flow velocity, which are significant in certain operations. The optimal MQF of the dual-layer filter is found to be over twice that of the first layer.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Fibrous filter materials are used to remove fine aerosol particles from gases at as low a pressure drop as possible, while achieving the desired quality of cleaned gas. High aerosol removal efficiency at low pressure drop can be achieved if the filter fibres carry an electric charge, allowing aerosol to be collected by additional electrostatic mechanisms. Unfortunately the efficiency of such materials is reduced as they are loaded with aerosol. Prefilter materials can also achieve very high efficiencies, but {{at the expense of}} greater pressure drop, and filter cakes, which have very high pressure drops, form on such materials at low aerosol particle loads. Producing a fibrous filter from both types of material, a composite, allows efficient aerosol collection at low pressure drop, and high dust holding capacity. This work reports on an experimental program studying the aerosol particle penetration through, and pressure drop across a mixed fibre type electrically active material, and a number of prefilter materials of differing packing density, as they are loaded with aerosol particles.

The intra-lab variability (repeatability) was ~ 40 % and the inter-lab variation was ~ 25 %. The study showed that the new PN method has similar variability to other gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and better than the PM (intra-lab variability ~ 55 % and inter-lab ~ 35 %). Even with the improved PM method the emissions of the vehicle were similar with the background level (~ 0. 4 mg/km) and the method was subject to volatile artifact. The PN method showed greater sensitivity than the PM method as it could distinguish the DPF fill state or different preconditioning states of the vehicle. However, the PN emission level of the vehicle estimated by the reference system were on average 15 % higher than any given lab¿s own system, indicating that the procedures and calibration designed for the standardization of performance should be precisely defined and followed.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantitatively evaluate hood leakage by measuring <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> and turbulence during a volume generating process designed to simulate a hot process, defined here as any operation producing high temperature gases. A hot process has been recognized as a causal factor in the leakage of contaminants from laboratory fume hoods since 1950. A literature search reveals that during the last couple of decades only Johnson et al. reported a quantitative linear relationship between thermal loading and breathing zone trace gas concentrations using the ASHRAE 110 - 1995 method. Hot processes may well be the most common and least recognized of the operational factors able to cause fume hoods to leak. For hood performance testing, I conducted smoke tests and <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> tests. Smoke tests were executed by means of smoke tubes and smoke matches as screening tools for hood leakage. <b>Face</b> <b>velocity</b> tests were conducted at 16 points arranged to represent equal areas of the hood face when the sash was fully opened. <b>Face</b> <b>velocity</b> data were indexed in time and space and used to estimate turbulence. By assuming corresponding samples were collected simultaneously, turbulence parameters were computed as both spatial and temporal averages of the velocity pressure. Turbulence is represented by the ratio of the standard deviation to average <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> at each measurement point. Turbulence is generated by pressure differences occurring between the velocity pressure at the hood face and the volume generating rate that simulates a hot process. Through the average <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> and turbulence measurements, I found that at a fixed exhaust flow, with a fixed injection volume flow, turbulence is stronger in the open sash position than in the reduced sash position. Further, turbulence associated with a volume generating process is more evident in the space-based data than in the time-based data. <b>Face</b> <b>velocity</b> at each point tends to decrease in a hood when the flow injected by a volume generating process increases. These data suggest that when a hood is operated with a volume generating process, leakage can be minimized by reducing the sash opening, by not positioning any object within six inches of the hood face, and by keeping <b>face</b> <b>velocities</b> stable...|$|R

40|$|A `user {{tracer gas}} test` was {{performed}} on laboratory hoods, with a human subject {{standing in front of}} the hood, to assess hood containment ability. The relationship of <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> and cross draft variables to hood containment ability is investigated. The ability of these variables and other tests, such as smoke challenges or tracer gas tests performed with a manikin at the hood, to predict the results of the user tracer gas test is evaluated. All of the laboratory hoods tested in this study were identical bench top bypass hoods with horizontally sliding sashes. A <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> traverse, cross draft measurements, a pitot traverse to measure exhaust flow, a smoke test, a manikin tracer gas test, and a user tracer gas test were performed on each hood in several different sash positions. Based on the data collected, <b>face</b> <b>velocity,</b> its distribution and variability, and the magnitude of cross drafts relative to <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> are important variables in determining hood leakage. `Unblocked` vortices, formed such that no physical barrier exists between the vortex and room air or a person in front of the hood, are identified as important sites of leakage. For the hoods evaluated in this study, unblocked vortices were observed along the beveled side edges. The data support the hypothesis that in the presence of a person {{standing in front of the}} hood, leakage is more likely to occur if unblocked vortices are formed than if all vortices are blocked. Evidence suggests that cross drafts are more likely to cause leakage when flowing in a direction that may cause separated flow along a beveled edge of the hood and thereby augment the unblocked vortices along the edge.

In the case that the <b>filtered</b> <b>face</b> set is the singular <b>filtered</b> <b>face</b> set associated to a pseudomanifold, we prove that our definition coincides with M. Goresky's definition. Several examples of concrete computation of perverse Steenrod squares are given, including the case of isolated singularities and, more especially, we describe the Steenrod squares on the Thom space of a vector bundle, in function of the Steenrod squares of the basis and the Stiefel-Whitney classes. We detail also an example of a non trivial square, ^ 2 H_p→ H_p+ 2, whose information is lost if we consider it as values in H_ 2 p, showing the interest of the Goresky and Pardon's conjecture...|$|R

To examine the role of different spatial frequencies in any learning, we also used high-pass <b>filtered</b> <b>faces</b> that preserved featural information and low-pass <b>filtered</b> <b>faces</b> that severely reduced that featural information. Although all groups got faster over the 2 days of training, there was more improvement in accuracy for the group exposed to full spectrum faces than {{in the two groups}} exposed to <b>filtered</b> <b>faces,</b> both of which improved more modestly and only when the same faces were shown on the 2 days of training. For the group exposed to the full spectrum range and, to a lesser extent, for those exposed to high frequency faces, training generalized to a new set of full spectrum faces of a different size in a different task, but did not lead to evidence of holistic processing or improved sensitivity to feature shape or spacing in inverted faces. Overall these results demonstrate that only 2 h of practice in recognizing full-spectrum inverted faces presented from multiple points of view is sufficient to improve recognition of the trained faces and to generalize to novel instances. Perceptual learning also occurred for low and high frequency faces but to a smaller extent...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the numerical analysis}} of three type condensers for desalination of seawater system. The condensers that were analyzed were a finned tube condenser that was built in Malaysia desalination plant, a cooling tube condenser in Jordan, and a common plate finned tube condenser. The goal of the analysis is to observe the thermal performance parameters of a condenser such as heat and mass transfer coefficient, surface effectiveness and condensate flow rate. The parameters that were changed in the analysis were the <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> of air, the water velocity, {{and the number of}} rows of tubes. The numerical analysis was done based on basic heat exchanger analysis using e-NTU method for a dry case, and using a j-factor correlation that was developed by McQuiston for studying the wet case. Results from the basic heat exchanger analysis showed the air humidity ratio profile and temperature profile of air and water at the outlet of the condenser. The exit air temperature and humidity ratio were inversely proportional to the length of the condenser, whereas the temperature of the water at the outlet was proportional to the length of the condenser. Results from the j-factor correlation method show that the heat and mass transfer coefficient of the system increased when the number of rows of tubes, <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> and water velocity increased. Similarly, the analysis showed that the condensate flow rate was highly influenced by the <b>face</b> <b>velocity.</b> In addition, the surface effectiveness was inversely proportional to the <b>face</b> <b>velocity.</b> by Hassan Mohamed.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A prototype perforated backplane air baffle for a laboratory safety hood was designed, fabricated and its performance was evaluated experimentally. Relative to the historically poor performance of slot baffle design, the perforated metal created better laminar flow through the hood, and decreased turbulence in the form of vortices, ultimately resulting in better hood containment. New performance monitoring techniques were developed to aid in future testing of improved laboratory fume hood designs. Three methods were employed to evaluate the hood's performance: 1) <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> testing, 2) tracer gas containment testing, and 3) smoke containment. <b>Face</b> <b>velocity</b> data was analyzed to evaluate turbulence and consistency across the hood face with the use of new statistical methods described in this thesis. It was determined that turbulence decreased and velocity uniformity increased as the average <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> increased and as the open area of the hood face decreased. Tracer gas levels outside of the hood, in the operator's breathing zone, were kept below detectable levels (0. 02 ppm) at all <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> / sash position settings. In this work, a Hood Protection Factor was developed as a quantitative means to compare hood performance. The Hood Protection Factor is a true ratio of the contaminant concentration inside the hood exhaust duct to that in the operator's breathing zone, as both are measured values. A qualitative assessment of the hood's performance was completed by means of smoke testing. Smoke testing showed that smoke was captured / retained without escaping from the hood at all <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> / sash position settings. Static pressure measurements were taken at the back panel of the hood. Graphical analysis of this data allowed visualization of the uniformity of suction across the perforated air baffle. The prototype backplane air baffle provided reduced turbulence at the hood face, allowing improved containment efficiency. New performance monitoring techniques and statistical evaluation methods were developed so health and safety professionals may better evaluate and design laboratory fume hoods...|$|R
40|$|Coalescence {{separation}} of oil dispersions of various hydrometallurgical extractants and solvents was studied using in-house-developed fibrous media that showed good separation performance toward {{four out of}} six common extraction reagents suspended in water as small oil droplets. The separation was affected by oil/ water interfacial tension and their density difference. Further, using kerosene as the model oil, the separation was performed on a flatsheet bench to investigate the effect of other factors including the media thickness, influent oil concentration, and media <b>face</b> <b>velocity.</b> Media with larger thickness resulted in better separation and, correspondingly, higher pressure drop. The influent oil concentration and media <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> were mutual constraints to the separation efficiency. When the oil concentration was low, the time-weighted average separation efficiency stayed the same or increased with the velocity; when it was high, the opposite trend prevailed. </p...|$|R

Using different velocity components as either dependent variables or cell-face velocities, both convergent rate and calculation accuracy of the algorithm are compared and studied. A novel method, named “cross-correction”, is developed to improve the convergence of the algorithm of using non-orthogonal grids. Cases with benchmark and analytical solutions are used for numerical experiments and validation. The results show that, although different velocity components are employed as either dependent variables or cell <b>face</b> <b>velocities,</b> there is no obvious difference in both the convergent rates and numerical solutions. Moreover, the “cross-correction” method is validated by computations with several first-order and high-order convection schemes; and the generality of convergence improvement achieved by the method {{is shown in the}} paper...|$|R
