2500|$|Not {{unlike other}} Harley-Davidson engines, the unit {{construction}} {{left and right}} engine cases split vertically, and formed four cavities: a center front crankcase, a center rear gearbox, a right side cavity <b>gearcase</b> [...] for the timing train, where the four camshafts are housed, and a left cavity for the three row primary drive chain. A row of four camshafts had also been used on the KR racers, inherited from the sidevalve Model WL, and even earlier Model D of 1929. While the single camshaft of other Harley-Davidson designs was cheaper to manufacture, and quieter, four cams allowed better performance, such as greater flexibility in adjusting the cam timing, and the short single camshafts are durable, and give the pushrods a straighter path to the rocker arms.|$|E

50|$|The {{driving gear}} is a {{rotating}} rod spring-loaded 7-roll drive. It consists of five wheels, a guide wheel {{at the rear}} and the front drive wheel. Support rollers are not necessary because of the taut and relatively light chain. In off-road driving, the driver must be careful to keep the chain tension constant. Even with a failed torsion bar the M548 is still roadworthy. The power of the motor drives the transfer <b>gearcase,</b> generator and the cooling of the differential/steering gear. The transfer <b>gearcase</b> {{can be used as}} a separating clutch when towing the vehicle and serves to reduce the motor's speed. The power transmission between the drive follows the torque converter with an automatic lock-up clutch.|$|E
5000|$|A large {{investment}} {{was made in}} 1966 when they also bought the old Gresham & Craven plant in Walkden, Lancashire. This plant had a large iron foundry, pattern shop and machine shop. It was reorganised to supply diesel engine parts that were previously bought from sub-contractors, including: cylinder heads, crankcases, flywheels, <b>gearcases</b> and a multitude of small parts for the parent plants. It also assembled moisture extraction units and the SR range of diesel generators employing 200-250 personnel until it was closed in 1971 because of a downturn in demand for diesel engines.<6> ...|$|R
5000|$|He was {{sufficiently}} successful {{to be able}} in 1897 to run the first motor car in the town, a Coventry Motette. Following this he bought six Benz engines and fitted them to his own chassis and sold them as the Grose-Benz. In February, 1900 the Company's name was changed to Grose Ltd and the <b>gearcase</b> business was sold and the factory in Pike Lane, Northampton was adapted to manufacture [...] "Grose" [...] Steel Studded Non-Skid Tyres, which Joseph Grose had invented for his newly built motor cars.|$|E
50|$|The Heisler {{locomotive}} was {{the last}} variant {{of the three major}} types of geared steam locomotive Charles L. Heisler receiving a patent for the design in 1892, following the construction of a prototype in 1891. Somewhat similar to a Climax locomotive, Heisler's design featured two cylinders canted inwards at a 45-degree angle to form a 'V-twin' arrangement. Power then went to a longitudinal drive shaft {{in the center of the}} frame that drove the outboard axle on each powered truck through bevel gears in an enclosed <b>gearcase</b> riding on the axle between the truck frames. The inboard axle on each truck was then driven from the outboard one by external side (connecting) rods.|$|E

5000|$|The Tamiya [...] "Bullhead" [...] {{which was}} {{released}} November 13, 1990 utilises {{the same basic}} chassis design as the Clod Buster, albeit moulded in different coloured plastics. The most significant difference is that it carries a taller semi-tractor type body, likely inspired by fullsize semi-bodied monster trucks such as [...] "Super Pete". The other differences between the Bullhead and Clod Buster (other than the body) lie mainly in {{the color of the}} plastic used for various parts. The Bullhead has a red chassis, while the Clod has a black chassis. The shocks, <b>gearcase</b> bumpers, end links and a few other small parts are yellow on the Bullhead; these same parts are red on the Clod Buster. Other minor differences on the Bullhead are its chrome-plated wheels, chrome suspension bars and a chassis brace. Because tamiya discontinued the bullhead finding a mint condition bullhead in a factory sealed box is very rare. Some collectors have spent over 800 dollars for mint condition Bullhead today.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the years}} that Frigidaire was owned by General Motors, it was very {{competitive}} in the automatic clothes-washing-machine business. Frigidaire engineer Kenneth Sisson, also credited with {{the design of the}} incrementing timer used on clothes washers and dishwashers for years to come, designed the Frigidaire automatic washer with the Unimatic mechanism in the late 1930s. Production of the first Frigidaire automatic clothes washers was halted due to World War II and therefore the machine was not formally introduced until 1947. The washing action of a Frigidaire automatic was unique in that the agitator pulsated up and down, a unique departure from the traditional oscillating type. The Frigidaire washers were commonly named for their mechanisms, which, in true General Motors fashion, underwent frequent changes over the years. The Unimatic was in production the longest, for any single Frigidaire mechanism, from 1947 to 1958. The Pulsamatic mechanism, unique in that it pulsated 630 times per minute, was introduced in 1955 for the lower-end models. This became the foundation for the Multimatic, introduced for the 1959 model year. The Multimatic lasted through 1964, as the Rollermatic was brought out for the 1965 lineup. The Rollermatic was unique in that instead of using an oil-filled <b>gearcase,</b> metal and urethane rollers transferred the power within the mechanism. This underwent a slight revision in 1970 for the new eighteen-pound capacity 1-18, which kept the same basic mechanism but differed in that it was belt-driven off of the motor and added a recirculating pump. Besides the unique action, another notable feature of these older washers was the final, high-speed spin cycle (nicknamed [...] "Rapidry"), 1140 revolutions per minute in the Unimatic, 850 in the Multimatic, and 1010 in the high-end Rollermatic models.|$|E
5000|$|In 1950 Mercury {{engineers}} {{came out}} with the Super 10 Hurricane, Model KG-7. This motor was based on previous models KE-7 Lightning and KF-7 Super 10. Upgrades included redesigned connecting rods, upgraded aluminum clamp and swivel brackets, a new high RPM magneto, improved porting, an 8 Reed valve cage (as opposed to KE-7 and KF-7’s 4) and larger crankcase opening. Hurricane was also advertised at 10 hp*, way below the actual horsepower developed, Mercury noted this asterisk by stating that horsepower varies with rpm; really the Hurricane could deliver up to 18 hp. Shortly after the introduction of the Hurricane, Mercury came up with their first performance gear case with the capability of mating to a standard driveshaft housing of a KG-7 or similar green top engine of the time. This was named “Quicksilver” and promised an extra 20 to 30% increase in top speed. Essentially, it boasted a significantly slimmer pointed gear case that housed an integrated rubber rotex water pump and forward only 1:1 gears along with the necessary bearings. After a few months of use, Mercury found that the average race boat's transom would not elevate the standard driveshaft housing and quicksilver gear case high enough for peak performance. Rectifying this problem, Mercury developed the Quicksilver driveshaft housing. This new driveshaft housing was three inches shorter which in turn lowered the motor's center of gravity on the boat which helped turning ability, reduced the strain on the boat's transom and motor's clamp brackets, and decreased underwater drag while increasing top speed as less <b>gearcase</b> was below the boat. In addition the motor had a sort-of cut down lower anti-cavitation plate, protruding forward upper anti-cavitation plate (spray plate), a stronger rear-mounted steering bar design, and finally, an exhaust opening above the water surface that reduced exhaust back pressure while increasing noise levels when the boat was on plane. When the dealer installed the quicksilver driveshaft housing and gear case (packaged at $82.25) he had authorization to hand stamp a small [...] "Q" [...] behind the serial numbers on the tag and block. Some did, some did not - and so, the [...] "Stamped Q" [...] came to be. 1951 saw the first production race-ready outboard models; KG-4Q, KG7-Q, and KG-9Q. These motors were pulled off the production line at random, given the quicksilver gear case, driveshaft housing, and [...] "Q" [...] stamp behind the tag serial number and block serial number. These KG-7Qs worked fine on runabouts but were too long for hydroplanes - and the racers made this known to Mercury. So thus was born the 2" [...] shorter [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing in 1952. Right before Mercury released this [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing, they still had several [...] "Q" [...] length driveshaft housings, so they introduced a factory KG-7Q which had a green silk screened Q behind the serial number on the tag and a factory stamped [...] "Q" [...] on the block. These motors are very rare; they fall into the serial range of 532404-532963.|$|E
40|$|High-speed {{traction}} studies need {{to carry}} out detailed equations for formalising a complete electromechanical model, representing the dynamic coupling of electrical and mechanical phenomena. Starting from Lagrange and Park theories, and after recalling the general criteria for the set-up of the two distinct mechanical and electrical sub-systems, the new formalisation of a complete dynamic model is presented, with specific reference to a train dedicated to high-speed services. Simulations are carried out in case of three-phase short circuit faults at a speed of 100 km/h. Representative {{of the dynamics of}} each single component, the investigation focuses in particular on the components of transmission (rotor, cardan joint, <b>gearcase)</b> and the relevant torques associated to the short circuit dynamics...|$|E
