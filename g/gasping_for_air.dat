5|$|A young Addie (Katelyn Reed) {{stares up}} at an old mansion when two {{troublesome}} twins Brian and Troy (Kai and Bodhi Schulz) arrive, planning to enter the house. Addie warns them not to enter the house, but they ignore her warning and enter the house anyway. While they wreak havoc, Brian discovers a dying animal and the twins find an open door to the basement. They enter the basement where they find jars containing animal remains and human fetuses. After complaining about the smell, Brian leaves the basement {{only to find that}} his brother has gone silent. He searches for him and finds him with his throat slit, <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b> The Infantata (Ben Woolf) appears behind him and kills him off screen.|$|E
5|$|The station {{provided}} two permanent crew quarters, the Kayutkas, phonebox-sized booths set {{towards the}} rear of the core module, each featuring a tethered sleeping bag, a fold-out desk, a porthole, and storage for personal effects. Visiting crews had no allocated sleep module, instead attaching a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall; US astronauts installed themselves within Spektr until a collision with a Progress spacecraft caused the depressurisation of that module. It was important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts could wake up oxygen-deprived and <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air,</b> because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads.|$|E
25|$|Dennis McGuire was {{executed}} in Lucasville, Ohio, on January 17, 2014. According to reporters, {{the execution of}} McGuire took more than 20 minutes and McGuire was <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air</b> for 10 to 13 minutes. It was the first use of a new drug combination which was introduced in Ohio after the European Union banned sodium thiopental exports. This renewed criticism on the conventional three-drug method.|$|E
5000|$|Blockage of the bronchi and trachea with {{worms and}} mucus will cause {{infected}} birds to <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b> They stretch out their necks, open their mouths and <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> <b>air</b> producing a hissing noise {{as they do}} so. This [...] "gaping" [...] posture {{has given rise to}} the common term [...] "gapeworm" [...] to describe Syngamus trachea.|$|R
60|$|Miss Tipping {{looked at}} him reproachfully, but Mr. Tipping, raising his eyes, <b>gasped</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
50|$|Winter {{swimming}} can {{be dangerous}} {{to people who are}} not used to swimming in very cold water. After submersion in cold water the cold shock response will occur, causing an uncontrollable <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b> This is followed by hyperventilation, a longer period of more rapid breathing. The <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> <b>air</b> can cause a person to ingest water, which leads to drowning. As blood in the limbs is cooled and returns to the heart, this can cause fibrillation and consequently cardiac arrest. The cold shock response and cardiac arrest are the most common causes of death related to cold water immersion.|$|R
25|$|Twilight finds a {{book about}} the Crystal Empire's past, {{learning}} of a Crystal Fair used to raise the spirits of the Crystal Ponies. She and her friends go about to recreate the fair; Twilight assumes that one aspect, a Crystal Heart, is a ceremonial piece and constructs a crude version of it from crystal. As Cadance's magic starts to falter, the fair starts, and the Crystal Ponies soon cheer up and slowly remember their past. Rainbow Dash overhears one discuss part of the ceremony of the fair where they would channel their elated feelings into the Crystal Heart to protect the Empire; Rainbow races back to warn Twilight they need to find the real Crystal Heart, and Twilight discovers that the page about the Heart's powers has been purposely torn out from the book. Just then, Cadance's magic completely shuts down as she collapses in Shining Armor's arms, <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air,</b> allowing King Sombra to surround the Empire.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1896 – 1897, the health of Grand Duke Friedrich Franz deteriorated. In the spring, Anastasia took her husband to Grasse {{in the hope that}} the change of {{location}} might initiate a recovery. It was during this time that their eldest daughter, Alexandrine, was engaged to the son of the Danish Crown Prince, who later became King Christian X of Denmark. A few weeks later, at the beginning of April, Anastasia returned with her husband to Villa Wenden. Anticipating the worst, she sent for their son, who was studying in Dresden. On April 10, while the family and household were at dinner, a coachman found Grand Duke Friedrich Franz unconscious at the bottom of the villa's -high retaining wall on the road below the rose-festooned parapet, which encircled the villa's garden. He had jumped in an attempt to end his life. He was carried back to the villa, where he finally died. The official report was that the sick grand duke, <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air,</b> had gone to the balcony falling down over the railing accidentally.|$|E
25|$|The station {{provides}} crew {{quarters for}} {{each member of}} the expedition's crew, with two 'sleep stations' in the Zvezda and four more installed in Harmony. The American quarters are private, approximately person-sized soundproof booths. The Russian crew quarters include a small window, but provide less ventilation and sound proofing. A crew member can sleep in a crew quarter in a tethered sleeping bag, listen to music, use a laptop, and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the module's walls. The module also provides a reading lamp, a shelf and a desktop. Visiting crews have no allocated sleep module, and attach a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall. It is possible to sleep floating freely through the station, but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into sensitive equipment. It is important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts can wake up oxygen-deprived and <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air,</b> because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads.|$|E
60|$|The blow {{took the}} Rockpoint bully behind the ear, and Crosby {{let out a}} wild yell of pain, broken by a <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> <b>air,</b> as he went under the bosom of the ocean.|$|R
60|$|He knew he {{was near}} the bottom of some ship and held his breath as long as possible. When he again arose it was to <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b> Now he was free of the ship, and the rolling waters of the Gulf of Mexico lay all around him.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{after seeing}} what alcohol {{has done to}} her life, Emily drives to a lake and tries to drown herself. At the last minute, she <b>gasps</b> <b>for</b> <b>air</b> and says [...] "My mother chose to die. There was nothing I could do to ease her pain. Except maybe, {{choosing}} to live." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Dreamlover" [...] was {{directed}} by Diane Martel and filmed in upstate New York in June 1993. The video features scenes of Carey swimming in a small pond by a waterfall, boarding a colorful hot air balloon, and dancing alongside several shirtless male dancers. As the video begins, Carey is swimming underwater while wearing clothing. She is soon <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air</b> and climbing into a flower bed above. As she frolics and rolls in a field, scenes of Carey boarding a hot air balloon are inter-cut. Her dog Jack makes a cameo appearance, as he follows her through the field and pond. After a short interval of dancing alongside several male dancers, Carey leaves with her dog as the video concludes. After filming the video, Carey revealed that the water was so cold that she refused to swim until the director, Martel, dived in first. Author Chris Nickson felt the video captured the song's soft and relaxed nature: [...] "The casual feel, almost like clips from home movies edited together, captured the song's off-the-shoulder airiness." [...] The video received heavy rotation on several video music channels, which added to the song's chart performance.|$|E
2500|$|At the September 2, 1983, {{execution}} of Jimmy Lee Gray in Mississippi, officials cleared the viewing room after eight minutes while Gray {{was still alive}} and <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b> The decision to clear the room {{while he was still}} alive was criticized by his attorney. David Bruck, an attorney specializing in death penalty cases, said, [...] "Jimmy Lee Gray died banging his head against a steel pole in the gas chamber while reporters counted his moans." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flinching {{is showing}} a strong {{negative}} physical {{reaction to a}} proposal. [...] Common examples of flinching are <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air,</b> or a visible expression of surprise or shock. [...] The flinch can be done consciously or unconsciously. [...] The flinch signals to the opposite party that you think the offer or proposal is absurd in hopes the other party will lower their aspirations. [...] Seeing a physical reaction is more believable than hearing someone saying, [...] "I'm shocked." ...|$|E
60|$|The cramped area of {{the prison}} had such an effect on Mrs Meagles that she began to weep, and such an effect on Mr Meagles {{that he began to}} <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b> He was walking up and down the room, panting, and making himself worse by laboriously fanning himself with her handkerchief, when he turned towards the opening door.|$|R
50|$|Movement four {{is based}} on the sounds of {{aboriginal}} tribes and the desert of Australia. It is essentially a long, virtuoso trombone solo played in imitation of the didgeridoo. The soloist plays a pedal B-flat, and sings an F, a twelfth higher. This, combined with different articulations, screams and occasional harmonic changes, creates a sound resembling didgeridoo. The movement ends with another <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
50|$|On June 20, 1992, after {{a lengthy}} choir rehearsal, Whitfield went with four of the choir members to Elias Brother's Big Boy; a popular local {{restaurant}} on Telegraph Road. At the table, he started to clutch his chest and began to <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b> After being administered CPR by his dinner companions and arriving at Garden City Hospital, Whitfield died on June 21, 1992.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Village Voice, Anderson cited rock musician Lou Reed {{as the model for}} her songwriting style on Past Life Martyred Saints. J. Edward Keyes of Rolling Stone attributes the [...] "wintry layers of sound and startling left turns" [...] in the album to Anderson developing her lyrical technique while simultaneously editing avant-garde videos. Some professional music critics have classified the record as being primarily folk-noise, while also containing notable rock elements. Many songs on the album contain moments of Anderson <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air</b> between lyrics, which Ad Mehta from the online publication One Thirty BPM described as being [...] "intimate, dramatic, and potent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{aspects of}} Kiki's {{behavior}} and appearance {{have been the}} focus of commentary. One major theme is Kiki's transition into adulthood. While being raised by loving parents who support her independence, [...] Kiki is faced with problems common in adolescence such as finding a job, seeking acceptance, and taking care of herself. The concept of vulnerability is also examined closely in the film. Critic Mark Schilling noted a scene during Kiki's first night away from home, staying with the bakers: [...] Early in the morning, she quickly steps out of her room into the outhouses and peers out to see the husband, Fukuo, stretching his muscles. After he leaves the scene, Kiki rushes back to her room and slams the door behind her while <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b> [...] "The scene does absolutely nothing to advance the plot and the humor in it is low...but...it wordlessly — and eloquently — expresses Kiki's youth, vulnerability, and isolation." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{he came to}} {{the surface}} again, <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air,</b> the Cinco Llagas was already some furlongs to leeward. But the roaring cheer of mocking valediction from the rebels-convict reached him across the water, to drive the iron of {{impotent}} rage deeper into his soul.|$|E
5000|$|Movement five is the finale. It {{begins with}} a {{slightly}} altered version of the [...] "Crocodile Chorus", and recaps the various other movements of the piece. It ends with the soloist flutter tonguing a very loud note while spinning around in circles. This creates a sinusoidal sound effect, with a rising and falling volume. The soloist takes one last <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> <b>air</b> and harmonizes with the orchestra on a final note that fades into silence.|$|R
5000|$|While {{driving for}} some time, he removes the blindfold. The car {{suddenly}} crashes and flips on its side. Tony frees himself, but Anne, strapped in {{a seat belt}} with her hands still bound, is unable to do the same. Tony climbs back and cuts the seat belt, pulls {{her out of the}} car, and onto the grass. While she <b>gasps</b> <b>for</b> <b>air,</b> Tony says, [...] "I saved your life. That means I own you." ...|$|R
50|$|For the {{promotion}} exam, Medina must knock Master down once before she is knocked down three times. In the first round, Medina goes down quickly after losing her balance from a kick to her thigh. In the second round, she falls from a palm strike to her chest. As she <b>gasps</b> <b>for</b> <b>air,</b> Tesla and Enzo show concern. Medina quickly plans a better offense, and wins the next round. Master promotes her and gives her some words of wisdom.|$|R
60|$|Ashe, rehearsing this {{interview}} in the passage before his entry, had decided that he could hardly do better than model himself on the detective. So he began to be curt, crisp and mercilessly compelling to Freddie; and {{after the first few}} sentences he had that youth <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Those large {{brown eyes}} were shown {{for a few}} moments beneath the heavy lids, and met hers. The mouth, {{hitherto}} only <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air,</b> endeavoured to form a word; the hand sought hers. She kissed him, and his eyes opened wide and brightened, while he said, 'I think it is pardon now.' ...|$|E
60|$|Hour passed after hour. There {{was more}} room now, for already half the inmates {{of the place}} had succumbed. The noises, too, had lessened, for no longer could the parched lips and throats utter {{articulate}} sounds. Charlie and Tim, strong men as they were, leaned utterly exhausted against the wall, bathed in perspiration, <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Sleep apnea, obstructive sleep apnea, {{obstruction}} of the airway during sleep, causing lack of sufficient deep sleep, {{often accompanied by}} snoring. Other forms of sleep apnea are less common. When air is blocked from entering into the lungs, the individual unconsciously <b>gasps</b> <b>for</b> <b>air</b> and sleep is disturbed. Stops of breathing of at least ten seconds, 30 times within seven hours of sleep, classifies as apnea. Other forms of sleep apnea include central sleep apnea and sleep-related hypoventilation.|$|R
5000|$|... 1925: The {{tradition}} of [...] "tubbing" [...] {{came under fire}} {{following the death of}} Reginald Stringfellow at the University of Utah. Tubbing was a hazing ritual that involved pushing the victim's head under water until they can no longer hold their breath and <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> <b>air</b> under the water. His death through class hazing - hazing of freshmen by upperclassmen - led to the practice being banned at the University of Utah and brought greater recognition to the dangers of the practice.|$|R
25|$|Once an {{eruption}} occurs, a large CO2 cloud forms above {{the lake and}} expands to the neighbouring region. Because CO2 is denser than air, it {{has a tendency to}} sink to the ground while pushing breathable air up. As a result, life forms that need to breathe oxygen suffocate once the CO2 cloud reaches them, as there is very little oxygen in the cloud. The CO2 can make human bodily fluids very acidic, potentially causing CO2 poisoning. As victims <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> <b>air</b> they actually hurt themselves more by inhaling the CO2 gas.|$|R
60|$|He {{gripped the}} biceps of both {{her arms in}} a sudden spasm, {{attempting}} to climb out upon her as a drowning man might try to climb out on an oar and sinking her down under him. In the struggle under water, before he permitted her to wrench clear, her rubber cap was torn off, and her hairpins pulled out, so that she came up <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air</b> and half-blinded by her wet-clinging hair. Also, he was certain he had surprised her into taking in a quantity of water.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have come," [...] he said. [...] "Will you stay?" [...] The inertia seemed {{suddenly}} {{to leave her}} limbs. She threw up her head as though <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air,</b> escaped, somehow or other, from the thrall of his eyes, and passed across the smooth floor with flying footsteps. Her fingers seized {{the handle of the}} door and turned it, only to find it held by some invisible fastening. She shook it passionately. There was not even sound. She turned back once more. Prince Shan had only slightly changed his position. He stood upon the threshold of the inner room, and his arms were outstretched in invitation.|$|E
60|$|Soon we {{cleared the}} place and had lifted the stone, with {{ventilating}} holes in it--well was it for Sammy that those ventilating holes existed; also that the stone did not fit tight. Beneath was a bottle-shaped and cemented structure about ten feet deep by, say, eight wide. Instantly through the mouth of this structure appeared the head of Sammy with his mouth wide open {{like that of a}} fish <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b> We pulled him out, a process that caused him to howl, for the heat had made his skin very tender, and gave him water which one of the Mazitu fetched from a spring. Then I asked him indignantly what he was doing in that hole, while we wasted our tears, thinking that he was dead.|$|E
60|$|When {{they were}} in the hollow of the waves their {{position}} was easy enough, and they could make each other hear, by shouting loudly. When, however, they were on the crest of one of the mountainous waves, it was a hard struggle for life. The wind blew with such fury, taking the top of the water off in sheets, and scattering it in fine spray, that the boys were nearly drowned; although they kept their back to the wind, and held their breath as if diving, except when necessary to make a <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so awfully {{afraid of}} repressions," [...] said Mary at last, {{bursting}} suddenly and surprisingly into speech. She pronounced {{the words on}} the tail-end of an expiring breath, and had to <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> new <b>air</b> almost before the phrase was finished.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the game}} Smithers waited outside the rink for Cobby to leave. When Cobby came out Smithers chased {{him and was}} grabbed by at least 3 of Cobby's friends, Smithers grabbed Cobby's jacket and kicked Cobby once in the stomach area. Immediately Cobby {{fell to the ground}} and started to <b>gasp</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b> Cobby soon passed out and died shortly afterwards. It was {{discovered}} that he died from inhaling vomit after being kicked due to a rare condition in which his epiglottis failed. Although Smithers was unsure if the kick even landed (there were no marks on Cobby), he was still responsible.|$|R
