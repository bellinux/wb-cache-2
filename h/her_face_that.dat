25|$|Inside, Ruetten found Rasmussen dead on {{the living}} room floor, shot three times. There were signs of a struggle, such as a {{porcelain}} vase that had apparently been broken over Rasmussen's head prior to the shooting, a bloody handprint next to the burglar alarm's panic button, and a toppled credenza. It appeared that someone had bound her wrists, or tried to, at some point. She had defensive wounds and bore a bruise on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> appeared to have been inflicted by the muzzle of a gun. The gun had been fired through a quilt, apparently to muffle the sound. The investigating criminalist also observed a bite mark on Rasmussen's arm, and took a swab from it.|$|E
500|$|However, Thomas Seymour {{continued}} scheming {{to control}} the royal family and tried to have himself appointed {{the governor of the}} King's person. When Parr died after childbirth on 5 September 1548, he renewed his attentions towards Elizabeth, intent on marrying her. The details of his former behaviour towards Elizabeth emerged, and for his brother and the king's council, this was the last straw. In January 1549, Seymour was arrested on suspicion of plotting to marry Elizabeth and overthrow the Lord Protector. Elizabeth, living at Hatfield House, would admit nothing. Her stubbornness exasperated her interrogator, Sir Robert Tyrwhitt, who reported, [...] "I do see it in <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> she is guilty". Seymour was beheaded on 20 March 1549.|$|E

500|$|Although {{both were}} {{committed}} O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to {{conflict between the}} two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen to <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> he preferred Northrup sexually: [...] "This {{is a fact that}} I can do nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally – we get on well. Your character is superior. You are a greater person. I doubt that she would face what you have with me – or support me as well." [...] Some years later, addressing himself as [...] "You", Parsons told himself that his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick: [...] "Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema." ...|$|E
500|$|Chloe is {{characterized}} as a [...] "dynamic fashion guru" [...] by Global BC and a [...] "bad girl" [...] by Soap Opera Digest. Hendrickson expressed her happiness in playing a [...] "manipulative" [...] character who takes advantage of people. She said, [...] "I get to play, not only this edgy, spicy kind of character, but she's actually pretty funny too, so it's nice to bring some humor into it as well." [...] Chloe is a [...] "bitchy" [...] stylist who is hired at Jabot Cosmetics as a fashion consultant. Explaining her initial portrayal of Chloe, Hendrickson stated, [...] "I {{was the one who}} wanted to make her edgy and funny. Most of the people I know who are in the fashion business are a little bitchy. I wanted to make Chloe interesting, instead of just playing her like some girl who was putting on fancy clothes. There was no conflict there. The writers definitely gave me that in the writing, and I tweaked it a little. They seemed to enjoy it. Each day, Chloe kept getting funnier and bitchier." [...] She first works with young model Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), the new face of Jabot whom she treats harshly. According to Hendrickson, Chloe [...] "takes her job very seriously. [...] is used to working with more professional models and is very hard on Lily regarding, you know, keeping up some sort of appearance if you will, regarding the fashion industry, which is weight. So [...] starts to give [...] a little weight complex because she is constantly throwing in <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> either she doesn't fit into things or they have to make things larger for her, etc." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 2 May 1797, Sarah Siddons's {{character}} of Agnes in Lillo's Fatal Curiosity suggested murder with [...] "an expression in <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> made {{the flesh of the}} spectator creep." [...] In the audience was Crabb Robinson, whose respiration grew difficult. Robinson went into a fit of hysterics and was nearly ejected from the theatre.|$|E

60|$|Edith started; {{looking at}} her with such a strange dread in <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>that</b> Florence was more frightened than before.|$|E
