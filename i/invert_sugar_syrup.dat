40|$|An {{investigation}} was done into {{the recovery of}} invert sugar from sugar cane molasses. A pilot plant was designed and constructed to evaluate the clarification and separation of molasses to produce <b>invert</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup.</b> The aim of the pilot plant was to prove the process and deliver data so as to facilitate the design and prove the financial viability of a commercial plant. The pilot plant had to process 300 kg/day of molasses. The clarification of molasses by centrifugal separation, a known desludging process, did not produce a product of acceptable quality {{which could be used}} in a chromatographic separator. The results were disappointing. The product obtained was also not suitable for dead end pressure filtration. The turbidity remaining after the centrifugal separation also did not respond to a second flocculation process. Conventional settling clarification was investigated. Seven factors that could influence the consolidation and settling of suspended solids in molasses were identified, namely: the age of the diluted molasses, the temperature of the flocculated mixture, the variations across various batches of flocculant, the effect of reaction time of the phosphoric acid, the optimum flocculant dosing concentration, the optimum concentration of the molasses solution and the effect of increasing the acid dosage. The optimum conditions to clarify molasses through settling were found to be: fresh molasses, at 28 Brix and 60 °C, allowing 10 min intervals between acidification with 3, 75 g (as 100 %) phosphoric acid/ kg dry material (assumed equal to Brix) and neutralisation with 5 g (as 100 %) caustic/kg dry material (assumed equal to Brix), flocculation with any batch of flocculant 6195, dosed as a 1000 ppm solution. Commercial equipment was evaluated. The pilot plant E-cat clarifier was operated at 300 l/h and a thick sludge formed. The overflow was clear and it could be filtered. The molasses obtained was suitable for chromatographic separation. The recovery of sugars from molasses sludge has economic merit. From the evaluation of centrifugal separation and gravity separation it is clear that gravity separation again is the best method. The sweet-water obtained is consistent within the clarity requirement of 10 NTU/Brix and can be used to dilute raw molasses in the upstream processing step. The clarification process that was developed is patented. [Bekker, Stolz et. al. (2001) ] A sugar recovery of 93. 9 mass % at a purity of 99. 7 mass % from molasses, was achieved using a simulated moving bed, ion exclusion, pilot plant. The operating conditions for this performance were: feed flow at 14 l/h and at a temperature above 60 °C; water flow at 63 l/h and at a temperature above 65 °C; extract flow at 21 l/h; raffinate flow at 56 l/h; loop flow at 78 l/h and step time at 1326 seconds. This relates to the following bed volumes of the various separation zones: Bed Volume Zone 1 = 0. 694; Bed Volume Zone 2 = 0. 591; Bed Volume Zone 3 = 0. 661; Bed Volume Zone 4 = 0. 383. There is a trade-off between purity and recovery and a reduction in water usage. A preliminary environmental impact assessment and conceptual mass balance were done. The proposed plant integrates well into the existing Komati Mill of TSB and does not pose any significant environmental threat. The plant requires certain services from the mill. The mass balance investigated the water and steam consumption of the plant. Process integration was done so as to obtain the optimum utility consumption. The utility consumption of the plant does not exceed the capacity available at the mill. A small boiler is however required to produce steam during the annual mill maintenance period. Various techniques were used in a cost estimation for the invert sugar plant. The internal rate of return (IRR) is 42 % for a fixed capital investment of R 94, 270, 000. 00. The net return rate (NRR) for the project is 4 %/year, the net present value (NPV) - discounted at a 30 % cost-of-capital is R 41, 782, 000. 00. The net payout time (NPT) is 5. 207 years.

Solids incorporation and loss in mass after the dehydration process were also determined. The sensory acceptance of the in natura and osmo-dehydrated fruits was determined for the attributes of aroma, flavour, texture and overall acceptance using a hedonic scale.

We concluded that the best alternative for the nutrition of M. flavolineata are the <b>sugar</b> <b>inverted</b> <b>syrup</b> with minerals, and semi-artificial fermented pollen based in soybean extract (T 5, 18 % proteins). Newly formed colonies, having 500 - 600 bees, must receive 10 to 20 ml of syrup and 25 g of semi-artificial fermented pollen weekly. CNPQ - Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e TecnológicoA criação de abelhas sem ferrão é antiga nas Américas. No entanto, a atividade ainda esta subdesenvolvida, necessitando de melhorias nas técnicas de manejo. Este estudo avaliou alternativas nutricionais para a abelha amazônica Melipona flavolineata, visando substituição da alimentação com mel e pólen fermentado. As seguintes alternativas nutricionais foram comparadas com o mel (T 1) : xarope de açúcar invertido com minerais (T 2) e este xarope acrescido de solução de aminoácidos e vitaminas nas seguintes concentrações: 0, 5 % (T 3), 1, 0 % (T 4) e 10 % (T 5). Ao pólen fermentado (T 1) foram comparados alimentos fermentados com inóculo de pólen fermentado de M. flavolineata, constituídos de: pólen apícola (T 2); levedo (T 3); e extrato de soja, em duas diferentes concentrações de proteínas (T 4, 12 % e T 5, 18 %). O valor nutricional das dietas foi baseado no consumo diário, no peso das operárias, no tamanho dos acinos das glândulas hipofaringeas e no tamanho dos oócitos. Avaliaram-se, tambem, os custos dos ingredientes das dietas. Os resultados obtidos indicaram que dentre as alternativas para o mel, não houve diferenças estatísticas entre o controle e todos os tratamentos. Foram encontradas diferenças apenas entre os tamanhos dos acinos das operárias alimentadas com os tratamentos 2 e 4, sendo o tratamento 4 superior. Os custos dos ingredientes indicaram o tratamento 2 como sendo mais barato que os demais. Dentre as alternativas para o sabura foram encontradas maiores diferenças. O consumo do tratamento 4 foi significativamente superior ao do T 3, indicando maior aceitação do extrato de soja em relação ao levedo. Em relação aos demais parâmetros avaliados, o tratamento 5 foi superior a todos os demais e seu custo foi muito inferior ao do T 2 e semelhante ao dos T 3 e T 4. Concluiu-se que as melhores alternativas para a nutrição de M. flavolineata sao o xarope de acucar invertido com minerais, e o pólen fermentado semi-artificial à base de extrato de soja. Colônias recém-formadas, com 500 - 600 abelhas, devem receber 10 a 20 ml de xarope e 25 g de pólen fermentado semi-artificial semanalmente...|$|R
40|$|Polymer-clay nanocomposites (PCN) {{based on}} cassava starch, {{synthetic}} hectorite clay and <b>inverted</b> <b>sugar</b> cane <b>syrup</b> (plasticizer) were prepared by solvent-assisted (casting) process producing transparent and homogeneous films. Small amounts of clay (5 - 15 wt. %) resulted mainly in exfoliated nanocomposites while large amounts (30 wt. %) promote the intercalated nanocomposites formation. FT-Raman bands sensitive to hydrogen bonding in starch granules are progressively shifted to lower wavenumbers as the clay content is raised. Nanocomposites show a similar thermal behavior up to 320 ºC while the biomolecule decomposition at about 500 ºC {{is dependent on}} the clay content. CO 2 release at about 300 ºC (non-oxidative decomposition of polymeric chains) decreases if compared to the gas delivery at ca. 500 ºC, as the clay content is increased. Films with clay content higher than 10 wt. % show no substantial benefit for either elongation or resistance properties...|$|R

Caramel color is produced from commercially available nutritive sweeteners consisting of fructose, dextrose (glucose), <b>invert</b> <b>sugar,</b> sucrose, malt <b>syrup,</b> molasses, starch hydrolysates and fractions thereof. The acids that may be used are sulfuric, sulfurous, phosphoric, acetic, and citric acids; the alkalis are ammonium, sodium, potassium, and calcium hydroxides; and the salts are ammonium, sodium, and potassium carbonate, bicarbonate, phosphate (including mono- and dibasic), sulfate, and bisulfite. Antifoaming agents, such as polyglycerol esters of fatty acids, may be used as processing aids during manufacture. Its color ranges from pale-yellow to amber to dark-brown.|$|R
