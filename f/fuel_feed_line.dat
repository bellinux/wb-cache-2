50|$|The exact {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was not determined with certainty due to limited telemetry instrumentation at this early phase,but Martin-Marietta concluded that low fuel tank pressure during the start procedure allowed some of the burning fuel in thecombustion chamber to leak into the fuel system through the injector head before full propellant pressure {{was obtained from the}} turbopump. GE on the other hand argued that the culprit was a loose fuel connection, and the actual truth appeared to be somewhere in-between. Investigation concluded that tank and fuel system pressure were slightly lower than nominal, which resulted in insufficient pressure in the injector head. As a result, hot combustion gas backed up into the injector head and caused a large pressure spike. The injector rings completely burned through, followed by rupture of the combustion chamber. At T+1 second, a shock wave in the thrust section of the booster ruptured a <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> <b>line,</b> completely terminating engine thrust. GE technicians had failed to catch this design flaw during testing and a temporary fix was made by increasing tank pressure. Eventually, a further modification was made by using ethane gas to increase fuel force and prevent rough start transients. The X-405 engine did not fail again on subsequent launches and static firing tests.|$|E

ENSI did not register any reportable events in the Swiss national central interim storage facility for radioactive waste (ZWILAG) at Würenlingen, or at the research reactors of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne and the University of Basel. The reportable events included four reactor scrams: one each at the Mühleberg and Gösgen nuclear power plants, and two at the Beznau plant. ENSI classified one event during 2012 at level 1 on the INES scale, which ranges from 0 to 7.

40|$|Perturbations in {{the rate}} of fuel flow from the {{injector}} into the combustor can directly affect unsteady motions in the combustor. Therefore, understanding the dynamic characteristics of the injector is important in the effort to control these phenomena. An experimental study on the dynamic response of a pressure-swirl injector under low frequency pressure oscillation conditions was carried out using a pulse valve and the three-microphone technique. Liquid kerosene was used as the fuel and the <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> was designed for fuel flow modulations up to 200 Hz. Acoustic pressure and specific acoustic impedance were obtained within the <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> <b>line.</b> The magnitude of the specific acoustic impedance with respect to frequencies was varied by the static pressure in the fuel tubing. A normalized fuel transfer function between mass flow rate and acoustic pressure fluctuations was obtained in the frequency range between 10 and 200 Hz. Its gain shows a tendency to increase with frequency. The phase of the normalized fuel flow rate fluctuation at the injector exit was also measured. The phase tends to decrease with increase in frequency, and it approaches 180 degrees out of phase with the pressure fluctuations at 200 Hz within the <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> <b>line...</b>|$|E

40|$|The Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) {{development}} program experienced two similar appearing <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> failures during the shutdown portion of two engine tests.

The cause of the high strain was traced to a period of unsteady flow separation during the start and cutoff of each test coincident with the oblique shock approaching the nozzle exit. Since elimination of the flow separation was impractical, the steps taken to allow engine development and flight preparations to continue were: (1) establish the safe operating life of the nozzle, (2) reinforce all low-strength welds, and (3) eliminate the use of thin-wall fuel feed lines.

40|$|At the NASA Glenn Research Center, a {{characterization}} rig {{was designed}} and constructed {{for the purpose of}} evaluating high bandwidth liquid fuel modulation devices to determine their suitability for active combustion control research. Incorporated into the rig s design are features that approximate conditions similar to those that would be encountered by a candidate device if it were installed on an actual combustion research rig. The characterized dynamic performance measures obtained through testing in the rig are planned to be accurate indicators of expected performance in an actual combustion testing environment. To evaluate how well the characterization rig predicts fuel modulator dynamic performance, characterization rig data was compared with performance data for a fuel modulator candidate when the candidate was in operation during combustion testing. Specifically, the nominal and off-nominal performance data for a magnetostrictive-actuated proportional fuel modulation valve is described. Valve performance data were collected with the characterization rig configured to emulate two different combustion rig fuel feed systems. Fuel mass flows and pressures, <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> lengths, and fuel injector orifice size was approximated in the characterization rig. Valve performance data were also collected with the valve modulating the fuel into the two combustor rigs. Comparison of the predicted and actual valve performance data show that when the valve is operated near its design condition the characterization rig can appropriately predict the installed performance of the valve. Improvements to the characterization rig and accompanying modeling activities are underway to more accurately predict performance, especially for the devices under development to modulate fuel into the much smaller fuel injectors anticipated in future lean-burning low-emissions aircraft engine combustors...|$|E
50|$|This time, {{the problem}} was traced to a {{defective}} rate gyro in the Agena which had gone undetected at launch.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanisms}} {{that control the}} operation of this combustor, an experimental setup is developed with access for detailed optical measurements. Propane is employed as fuel because the absence of liquid drops and combustion generated particulates in the combustion region significantly simplifies the optical diagnostics. The experimental techniques utilized include acoustic pressure measurements, space and time resolved radiation measurements, steady temperature measurements, exhaust flow chemical analysis, high speed video and intensified images of the reacting flow field by a computer based CCD camera imaging system. Flow visualization by the imaging system and the results from radiation intensity distribution measurements suggest that the periodic combustion processes caused by periodic vortex shedding and impingement provide the energy required to sustain the pressure oscillations. High radiation intensity occurs during {{a relatively short period}} of time and is in phase with the pressure oscillations, indicating that Rayleigh`s criterion is satisfied. Periodic variations of the air and fuel flow rates and, consequently, the air/fuel ratio of the reacting mixture inside the combustor appear to be another mechanism that contributes to the occurrence of periodic combustion and heat release processes. The presence of this mechanism has been uncovered by acoustic pressure measurements that revealed the presence of traveling pressure waves inside the air and <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> <b>lines.</b> These traveling waves produce periodic <b>fuel</b> and air <b>feed</b> rates which, in turn, result in periodic combustion and heat release processes within the combustor...|$|R

The same problem exists for subsonic passenger aircrafts, especially for Airbuses, which have hydraulics of high power where convective heat transfer with the environment is insufficient {{and there is no}} required temperature control of fluid. The most significant in terms of heat flow is the flow caused by the loss of power to the pump and when designing the hydraulic system (HS) it is necessary to pay very serious attention to it. To use a constant capacity pump is absolutely unacceptable, since HS efficiency in this case is extremely low, and the most appropriate are variable-capacity pumps, cut-off pumps, dual-mode pumps. The HS fluid cooling system should provide high reliability, lightweight, simple design, and a specified heat transfer in all flight modes. A system cooling the fluid by the <b>fuel</b> of <b>feeding</b> <b>lines</b> of the aircraft engines is the most effective, and it is widely used in supersonic aircrafts, where power of cooling system is essential. Subsonic aircrafts widely use convective heat exchangers. In thermal design of the aircraft hydraulics, the focus is generally given to the maximum and minimum temperatures of the HS fluid, the choice of the type of heat exchanger (convective or flow-through), the place of its installation.
