This gasket is a fractal, being self-similar and having a dimension d that is not known exactly but is roughly 1.3, which is higher than that of a regular (or rectifiable) curve (d = 1) but less than that of a plane (d = 2). The Apollonian gasket was first described by Gottfried Leibniz in the 17th century, and is a curved precursor of the 20th-century Sierpiński triangle.

5|$|For centuries, the Chinese {{had simply}} {{approximated}} {{the value of}} pi as 3, until Liu Xin approximated it at 3.154 sometime between 1–5 CE, although the method he used to reach this value is unknown to historians. Standard measuring vessels dating to the reign of Wang Mang (9–23 CE) also showed approximations for pi at 3.1590, 3.1497, and 3.167. Zhang Heng is the next known Han mathematician to have made an approximation for pi. Han mathematicians understood that the area of a square versus the area of its <b>inscribed</b> <b>circle</b> had an approximate ratio of 4:3, and also understood that the volume of a cube and the volume of its inscribed sphere would be 42:32. With D as diameter and V as volume, D3:V = 16:9 or V=9⁄16D3, a formula Zhang found fault with since he realized the value for diameter was inaccurate, the discrepancy being the value taken for the ratio. To fix this, Zhang added 1⁄16D3 to the formula, thus V = 9⁄16D3 + 1⁄16D3 = 5⁄8D3. Since he found {{the ratio of the}} volume of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 8:5, the ratio of the area of a square to the <b>inscribed</b> <b>circle</b> is √8:√5. With this formula, Zhang was able to approximate pi as the square root of 10, or 3.162. After the Han, Liu Hui approximated pi as 3.14159, while the mathematician Zu Chongzhi (429–500 CE) approximated pi at 3.141592 (or 355⁄113), the most accurate approximation the ancient Chinese would achieve.|$|E

25|$|The two diagonals {{and the two}} {{tangency}} chords are concurrent. One way to {{see this}} is as a limiting case of Brianchon's theorem, which states that a hexagon all of whose sides are tangent to a single conic section has three diagonals that meet at a point. From a tangential quadrilateral, one can form a hexagon with two 180° angles, by placing two new vertices at two opposite points of tangency; all six of the sides of this hexagon lie on lines tangent to the <b>inscribed</b> <b>circle,</b> so its diagonals meet at a point. But two of these diagonals {{are the same as}} the diagonals of the tangential quadrilateral, and the third diagonal of the hexagon is the line through two opposite points of tangency. Repeating this same argument with the other two points of tangency completes the proof of the result.|$|E
25|$|As {{the overall}} or {{external}} {{size of a}} roundabout (in the UK {{referred to as the}} <b>Inscribed</b> <b>Circle</b> Diameter – ICD) is reduced, so the maximum practicable (and prescribed) diameter for the central island is also reduced, whilst the width of the circulatory carriageway increases (due to the greater width of vehicle swept path at smaller turning radii). In most cases this results in it being too easy – certainly when traffic is light relative to capacity – for drivers to traverse the roundabout at relatively high speed, with scant regard for road markings or the potential dangers to self or conflicts with other road users. To mitigate this risk, a proportion of the circulatory carriageway – an annulus around the central island – is segregated from general use by demarcation lines and differentiated from the outer annulus of carriageway by a combination of slightly raised surface, adverse crossfall, contrasting colours and textures and demarcating lines. The effect of this is to discourage drivers from taking a more direct path through the roundabout, their line of least resistance being more tightly curved (and therefore slower) but more bearable. The inner annulus provides for the trailing axles of longer or articulated vehicles to sweep across the inner annulus, which is therefore known as an over-run area (in UK usage), truck apron, or mountable apron.|$|E

AD23) {{made the}} first known Chinese attempt at a more accurate calculation of 3.1457, {{but there is no}} record detailing the method he used to obtain this figure. In his work around 130, Zhang Heng compared the celestial circle to the diameter of the earth, proportioning the former as 736 and the latter as 232, thus calculating pi as 3.1724. In Zhang's day, the ratio 4:3 was given for the area of a square to the area of its <b>inscribed</b> <b>circle</b> and the volume of a cube and volume of the inscribed sphere should also be 42:32. In formula, with D as diameter and V as volume, D3:V = 16:9 or V=D3; Zhang realized that the value for diameter in this formula was inaccurate, noting the discrepancy as the value taken for the ratio. Zhang then attempted to remedy this by amending the formula with an additional D3, hence V=D3 + D3 = D3. With the ratio of the volume of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 8:5, the implied ratio of the area of the square to the circle is √8:√5. From this formula, Zhang calculated pi as the square root of 10 (or approximately 3.162). Zhang also calculated pi as [...] = 3.1466 in his book Ling Xian (靈憲).

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{consider}} 3 -periodic orbits in an elliptic billiard. Numerical experiments {{conducted by}} Dan Reznik {{have shown that}} the locus of the centers of <b>inscribed</b> <b>circles</b> of the corresponding triangles is an ellipse. We prove this fact by the complexification of the problem coupled with the complex law of reflection. 1. THE STATEMENT OF THE THEOREM AND THE IDEA OF THE PROOF Elliptic billiards are at the same time classical and popular subject (see, for example [1], [2], [3] and [4]) since they continue to deliver interesting problems. We will consider an ellipse and a billiard in it with the standard reflection law: the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Let the trajectory from a point on the boundary repeat itself after two reflections: this means that we obtained a triangle which presents a 3 -periodic trajectory of the ball in the elliptic billiard. Poncelet’s famous theorem [5] states that the sides of these triangles are tangent to some smaller ellipse confocal to the initial one. We prove the following fact which was observed experimentally by Dan Reznik [10]: THEOREM 1. 1. For every elliptic billiard the set of incenters (the centers of the <b>inscribed</b> <b>circles)</b> of its triangular orbits is an ellipse. ∗) Supported in part by RFBR grants 12 − 01 − 31241 mol-a and 12 − 01 − 33020 mol-a-ved. a...|$|R
