40|$|Despite {{the use of}} {{tributyltin}} (TBT) {{had been}} banned worldwide in 2008 there is still evidence of its deleterious presence in environment. We evaluate the usefulness of a 28 days sediment bioassay with Nassarius reticulatus females to monitor TBT pollution, using imposex as endpoint. In addition, butyltins were determined in sediments and tissues, and, whenever posible, imposex was assessed in native N. reticulatus at the same sites where sediments were sampled. In the bioassay, {{a significant increase in}} imposex parameters was obtained with three sediments (Vi 2, Vi 3, and Vi 4). No correlation was found between this and TBT concentrations in sediment although good correlations were obtained for TBT in tissues, putting in evidence TBT bioavailability in sediment. A significant decrease in imposex from 2008 to 2013 in native snails was only observed at sites that did not cause any effect in the bioassay. In contrast, imposex levels in 2013 were kept as high as 2008 in one of the sites where a significant imposex increase in the bioassay was observed. The bioassay proves thus to be a practical and ecological relevant tool, as: (i) it can be conducted in sites with no native populations of snails, (ii) it provides early identification of polluted sites, anticipating future imposex levels or early identification of recovering, and (iii) it yields information on the bioavailable fraction of the TBT in the sediment. Therefore, this tool can be of extreme usefulness under the scope of recent <b>European</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>frameworks...</b>|$|R
30|$|Although the two {{examples}} just given address {{important aspects of}} the invasive species problem, the general European policy framework remains spread across many similar and disjunct pieces of legislation. This creates confusion about which species and pathways should be addressed by which instrument, and ultimately means that many invasive species and pathways are not addressed [124]. In response, several programs have been established to identify gaps in the current framework and to suggest solutions. One example is the IMPASSE program that has reviewed the risks of introduction of invasive fish species and fish diseases through aquaculture ([URL] However, even if all recommendations from these programs were enacted, the basic <b>European</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> would remain scattered, creating large obstacles to a coordinated response to the invasive species problem.|$|E

40|$|In {{the aquatic}} tier- 1 effect {{assessment}} for {{plant protection products}} with an herbicidal mode of action in Europe, it is usually algae and/or vascular plants that determine the environmental risks. This tier includes tests with at least 2 algae and 1 macrophyte (Lemna). Although such tests {{are considered to be}} of a chronic nature (based on the duration of the test in relation to the life cycle of the organism), the measurement endpoints derived from the laboratory tests with plants (including algae) and used in the first-tier effect assessment for herbicides are acute effect concentrations affecting 50 % of the test organisms (EC 50 values) and not no-observed-effect concentrations (NOECs) or effect concentrations affecting 10 % of the test organisms (EC 10) values. Other <b>European</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>frameworks</b> (e. g., the Water Framework Directive) use EC 10 values. The present study contributes to a validation of the tiered herbicide risk assessment approach by comparing the standard first-tier effect assessment with results of microcosm and mesocosm studies. We evaluated EC 50 and EC 10 values for standard test algae and macrophytes based on either the growth rate endpoint (ErC 50) or the lowest available endpoint for growth rate or biomass/yield (Er/EyC 50). These values were compared with the regulatory acceptable concentrations for the threshold option as derived from microcosm and mesocosm studies. For these studies, protection is maintained if growth rate is taken as the regulatory endpoint instead of the lowest value of either growth rate or biomass/yield in conjunction with the standard assessment factor of 10. Based on a limited data set of 14 herbicides, we did not identify a need to change the current practice. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018; 37 : 175 – 183...|$|R

Renewable energy sources (RES) penetration increase addresses the global requirements towards a carbon neutral environment, and wind farms (WFs) are among the most well-known green electricity-production alternatives. The study explores wind power installation potential of the Dodecanese Islands and the storage or interconnection options, based on the national and <b>European</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> and the international scientific literature. The major finding is that, due to the high wind potential of the area, the National policy and targets focus on the installation of great RES power at Greek islands.

40|$|Building {{envelope}} {{has always}} been considered a key element to provide an ade-quate comfort level within buildings and to assure an optimal energy performance. Recently, its importance and centrality for the energy efficiency of buildings was even more strengthened by the growing {{awareness of the need}} to reduce the production of greenhouse gases (especially CO 2) and to significantly limit the consumption of fossil fuels. In particular, the new <b>European</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> (2010 / 31 /EU Energy Per-formance Buildings Directive - EPBD recast) sets the ambitious objective that, within 2020 all the new buildings (2018 for public buildings) will have to satisfy the "Nearly Zero Energy Building" (nZEB) target. The way towards the innovation of the building envelope, that today appears far more promising, consists in passing from the concept of "insulation" to that of "integra-tion and multifunctionality". This requires the transition from a "passive" or resistive component (recurring to the well-known electric analogy for the heat transfer) to an "ac-tive" component, where the networks become resistive and capacitive and are integrated with generation/conversion systems, as for example, the technologies for the on-site conversion of solar radiatio...|$|E

Donors have interests in these samples. In particular, donors have interests in samples by virtue of the personal data they contain. In relation to this observation, this article puts forward three arguments. First: The current <b>European</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> relating to samples is inadequate. This inadequacy results from not understanding samples in terms of the information they contain. Second: European data protection law, in particular as outlined in the forthcoming Data Protection Regulation, might be looked as a source of solutions. However, whether data protection law can apply to samples at all remains a subject of debate. One key argument supports the position that it cannot: Samples are not data, but rather are physical mater, and therefore can only a source of data. Third: The assertion that ‘samples are not data, but rather only physical matter’ is flawed. Samples do contain data – DNA is data.

In fact since 2005, as part of cross compliance, farmers have to keep their agricultural land in GAEC by complying with a number of minimum requirements in issues such as the prevention of soil erosion, the conservation of soil organic matter and structure, a minimum level of maintenance of habitats and the protection and management of water.

The question is: what happens when you, instead of a new building, consider an ancient or existing one? To answer this question, we have evaluated {{the possibility of using}} the BIM process effectively for the conservation and proclamation of Cultural Heritage. The target is to test the BIM programs, satisfying the requirements of new buildings, and see if they can also be successfully used in complex situations, like the ones linked to the Cultural Heritage field, where you have to consider the unicity of the architectural elements, the constructive systems and materials (those are not standardized as the new ones), the degradation of the structures and the environmental conditions.

User generated content (UGC), a term that already transmits a notion of amateur artists, has produced a plethora of new forms of artistic expression. One type of UGC are mashups, which are compositions that combine existing works (often) protected by copyright, and transform them into new original creations. The <b>European</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> has not yet reacted to the copyright problems provoked by mashups. Whereas the flexible US fair use doctrine has accommodated mashups rather easily, the strict corset of limitations and exceptions in Art 5 (2) -(3) of the InfoSoc Directive does not leave any, or only very lit-­‐ tle, room for this innovative and widely popular form of artistic expression for commercial or non-­commercial purposes. The paper analyzes the current Euro pean legal framework and identifies its insufficiencies with regard to enabling a legal mashup culture. By comparison with the US approach, an attempt is made to suggest solutions for the European legislator, based on the policy proposals of the EU Commission’s “Digital Agenda” and more recent policy documents (e. g. “On Content in the Digital Market”, “Licenses for Europe”). In this context a distinction is made between noncommercial mashup artists and the emerging commercial mashup scene...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{tries to}} put {{together}} a modest study on the actions taken at EU level in order to fight economic crime. A series of measures have been implemented at national and European level to create a framework for fighting criminality. The European institutions and the national authorities are improving their cooperation in order to fight the increasing number of economic crimes committed both in the private and public sector, while Member States are approximating their legislation to the provisions of the Community acquis. We have divided these efforts into five categories corresponding to the five main areas of economic crime identified at EU level: fight against fraud, which affects the financial interests of the European Union and mainly comprises fraudulent practices in the use of EU funds and in taxation, fight against piracy and counterfeiting, public and private corruption, money laundering and organised crime. In order to combat the negative influence criminality exerts {{on the development of the}} economy and of the overall society, for each of the above mentioned areas legislative, institutional, technical and administrative measures have been adopted.

Furthermore, the capacity of Power-to-Gas to store large quantities of renewable energy requires to reflect on the proposed legal framework on energy storage which has proposed under Clean Energy for all Europeans Package. As Power-to-Gas cannot only be considered to be an energy storage technology, but also an energy conversion/production activity which produces a gas from electricity generated from renewable sources, more legal issues are raised under the Renewable Energy Directive, such as the question whether the choice of carbon source for the methanation process is conditioned in anyway.

40|$|In this study, the arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), {{and zinc}} (Zn) {{contamination}} has been evaluated in the groundwater of Sardinia (Italy). Contamination by such chemical species {{is among the}} most relevant risks for many populations, thus giving general interest to the case studies presented in this chapter. A brief introduction about the <b>European</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> is given, followed by a description of the analytical methods used and a discussion of the results. Two areas were selected as case studies: the Osilo area, devoted to geogenic degradation, and the Iglesiente–Fluminese mining district mainly affected by anthropogenic contamination. The geochemical controls on the natural baselines of As, Cd, Pb, and Zn are generally related to natural sources, mostly derived from water–rock interaction processes in areas of known mineral occurrences. In fact, median concentrations of the investigated elements in the mineralized areas are much higher than those of the corresponding median regional values and sometimes exceed the Italian limits for drinking water. In the Iglesiente–Fluminese mining district very high concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Zn were measured in groundwater that circulates in areas affected by past mining activities. The results of this study clearly show that the understanding of the trace metal pollution trends, and the distinction of the anthropogenic impacts on the aquifer systems, is essential for evaluating the natural baseline of contaminants as well as for distinguishing the relevant processes that influence their chemical characteristics. Such information, together with the geological features of a region and/or subregion, should be taken into account prior to defining regulatory limits of contaminants in groundwater...|$|E

Those tasks, among others, are part of the European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer (ECIBC). The European QA Scheme has the goal to ensure the implementation of evidence-based practices throughout the entire breast cancer pathway, including screening and diagnosis. Having the objective to be a pan-European programme across borders, the European Regulation on Accreditation is the legal frame that would allow a consistent and publicly controlled development and implementation of the European QA Scheme in the different Member States and associated countries, and a harmonised approach to quality assurance in breast cancer care. Therefore, both with the scope of building up the knowledge base for the ECIBC, and in view of designing a flexible QA scheme adaptable to different organisational settings, a search of external quality assessment schemes for breast cancer care already in place in Europe was done, through different searches that included: MEDLINE, website of relevant scientific societies, and EC Reports,. Only schemes fully implemented, with evidence of current activity, with at least one centre in Europe currently holding the certificate awarded by that organisation and foreseeing a third-party audit / on-site survey were considered. A general analysis of schemes not including breast cancer specific requirements, but including general organisational recommendations impacting on the breast cancer pathways was done. For breast cancer specific schemes, on the other hand, information was collected and reported in two ways: (i) descriptive and (ii) comparative by applying three objective references: one on the accreditation-healthcare side, one on the accreditation-ISO side and the last one with a hospital management profile.

The research conducted on how it is regulated the enforcement of the European arrest warrant in the case of illegal liberty deprivation in the <b>European</b> <b>legislative</b> act (the <b>Framework</b> Decision 2002 / 584 /JHA) leads to the conclusion that the legislature failed to mention the violation in question in the group of the violation for which it was not necessary the inspection of the double incrimination, but, still, including the offenses as kidnapping, illegal restraint and hostage-taking. Even if theRomanian legislator included this violation in the above mentioned group, this situation is not solved, because it will cause some problems in the request by the Romanian judicial authorities of the enforcement of such warrant. Another criticized issue, observed not only in the <b>European</b> <b>legislative</b> act, but also in the internal law, is related to the lack of stipulations, which can lead to the possibility of issuing and executing a European arrest warrant and for the execution of educational measures for illegal {{deprivation of}} liberty and also others. Also, in order to increase the effectiveness of the execution of a European arrest warrant, we consider that it should be granted executive powers of all courts of Romania. The originality of the work consists of the critical observations and the lege ferenda proposal which covers both the European legislativeact and the Romanian Law. At the same time, the critical opinions are useful for the Romanian legislator that intends to supplement and amend the special law, and for the European one also for amending andsupplementing the European Framework Decision 2002 / 584 /JHA...|$|R
40|$|Pollution {{and health}} risks {{generated}} by improper {{solid waste management}} are important issues concerning environmental management in developing countries including Romania. In most cities, the use of open dumps in common for the disposal of wastes, resulting in soil and water resource contamination by leachate in addition to odors and fires. Solid waste management infrastructure and services in developing countries are far from achieving basic standards in term of hygiene and efficient collection and disposal. The paper presents an overview of current solid waste management (SWM) practices in Romania and suggests solutions {{to some of the}} major problems. Urban and rural waste management is considered and collection, transport, processing, recycling or disposal of waste materials is discussed relative to the National Waste Management Strategy and the National Plan for Waste Management, as well as <b>European</b> and national <b>legislative</b> <b>framework.</b> It was showed that land disposal {{will continue to be a}} disposal option but due to stricter regulation. Local and regional authorities are heavily and increasingly involved in the management of waste. In most cases, they are responsible for developing and implementing municipal waste management plans based on the medium to long term. Due to an increase in population and changes in lifestyle, the quantity and quality of MSW in Romania has changed. Lack of infrastructural, suitable planning and public awareness are the main challenges of MSW management in Romania...|$|R
40|$|Events, {{predominantly}} sport mega-events, {{have received}} {{an abundance of}} academic scrutiny. Some of these commentaries have critiqued how the staging of mega-events can violate a range of universal human rights. Far less is available that is concerned with how events are mobilised for human rights advocacy. This paper, drawing from an ongoing qualitative research project (Baltic Pride 2015 – 2017), focuses on the venacularisation of human rights to offer {{a view of the}} intricacies of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) activism {{at the level of the}} local. Discussion starts with an appraisal of existing universal human rights policies surrounding sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI), specifically United Nations (UN) and <b>European</b> Union (EU) <b>legislative</b> <b>frameworks.</b> This <b>legislative</b> premise is followed by a focus on vernacularisation; a concept that reveals the complicated processes of human rights claiming. A brief history of Baltic Pride provides the context for EuroPride 2015 as well as the subsequent analyses of research findings, which are explored through the themes: EuroPride 2015 Pride House and EUroPride’s Super VIPs. Methodologically, the research relies on a combination of ethnography and autoethnogarphy, and findings are embedded within the critical analyses. Photographs, field notes that are more akin to autoethnographic narrative and commentary from the interview participants help highlight the conceptual value of vernacularisation to research on human rights...|$|R
40|$|The {{profound}} {{evolution in}} the <b>European</b> and international <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> with respect to contractual restrictions on the assignment of claims offers {{an opportunity for a}} critical reinterpretation of Italian legislation and a different, innovative reconstruction of the conditions of admissibility of agreements aimed at restricting or prohibiting the assignment of monetary claims (and in particular of trade receivables) in order to understand and take adequately into account the different needs of traders as well as promoting their competitiveness in the international market. In this context, particular attention should be focused on, among other things, the interaction between the provisions on contractual restrictions on the assignment of receivables and the implementing provisions of Directive 2011 / 7 /EU on combating late payments in commercial transactions, as well as the recent introduction in Italy, under law decree no. 245 of 23 December 2013, of a provision concerning restrictions on the assignment of the right to compensation for injury or damage resulting from the use of motor vehicles and watercrafts. Moreover, an analysis of the fragmentation of the legislative solutions addressing the topic of pactum de non cedendo in different European countries provides a basis for reflection in the context of private international law, which highlights the substantial limits to competitiveness and {{to the development of the}} internal market resulting from this lack of homogeneity...|$|R
