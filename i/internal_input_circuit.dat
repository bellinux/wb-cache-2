The {{development}} of a device for the piecewise-linear approximation of a transient response for controlling an automated system of the production diagnosis of electronic component parameters on functional cells. Methods. A new measuring <b>input</b> <b>circuit</b> was developed for the control of defective electronic components on functional cells {{in order to obtain}} the integral transient response, provided that circuit parameters can be programmatically altered. In this case, {{there is no need to}} exclude the shunting influence of neighbouring elements on functional cells, since all parameters of all electronic equipment connected to the controlled points are taken into account and will influence the formation of the transient process. Results. The <b>input</b> measuring integrated <b>circuit</b> is capable of controlling the transient responses of both individual electronic components and their groups, consisting of various types of active and passive electronic components. The dependency between the systematic error in the piecewise-linear approximation of the transient response of the electronic components on functional cells and the time constant (T) of the <b>input</b> <b>circuit</b> of the measurement unit is established.
