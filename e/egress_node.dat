50|$|In {{unidirectional}} path-switched rings (UPSRs), two redundant (path-level) {{copies of}} protected traffic are sent {{in either direction}} around a ring. A selector at the <b>egress</b> <b>node</b> determines which copy has the highest quality, and uses that copy, thus coping if one copy deteriorates due to a broken fiber or other failure. UPSRs tend to sit nearer {{to the edge of}} a network, and as such are sometimes called collector rings. Because the same data is sent around the ring in both directions, the total capacity of a UPSR is equal to the line rate N of the OC-N ring. For example, in an OC-3 ring with 3 STS-1s used to transport 3 DS-3s from ingress node A to the <b>egress</b> <b>node</b> D, 100 percent of the ring bandwidth (N=3) would be consumed by nodes A and D. Any other nodes on the ring could only act as pass-through nodes. The SDH equivalent of UPSR is subnetwork connection protection (SNCP); SNCP does not impose a ring topology, but may also be used in mesh topologies.|$|E
50|$|Circuits in optical mesh {{networks}} can be unprotected, protected to {{a single}} failure, and protected to multiple failures. The end optical switches in protected circuits {{are in charge of}} detecting the failure, in some cases requesting digital cross connects or optical cross-connects in intermediate devices, and switching the traffic to/from the backup path. When the primary and backup paths are calculated, it is important that they are at least link diverse so that a single link failure does not affect both of them at the same time. They can also be node diverse, which offers more protection in case a node failure occurs; depending on the network sometimes the primary and backup path cannot be provisioned to be node diverse at the edges, ingress and <b>egress,</b> <b>node.</b>|$|E

Being the fastest protection scheme also makes it the most expensive; normally using more than double of the provisioned capacity for the primary because the backup path is usually longer due to the link and/or node diversity rule of thumb.|$|E

40|$|Burst {{assembly}} {{mechanism is}} one of the fundamental factors that determine the performance of an optical burst switching (OBS) network. In this paper, we investigate the influence of the number of burstifiers on TCP performance for an OBS network. The goodput of TCP flows between an ingress node and an <b>egress</b> <b>node</b> traveling through an optical network is studied as the number of assembly buffers per destination varies. First, the burst-length independent losses resulting from the contention in the core OBS network using a non-void-filling burst scheduling algorithm, e. g., Horizon, are studied. Then, burst-length dependent losses arising as a result of void-filling scheduling algorithms, e. g., LAUC-VF, are studied for two different TCP flow models: FTP-type long-lived flows and variable size short-lived flows. Simulation results show that for both types of scheduling algorithms, both types of TCP flow models, and different TCP versions (Reno, Newreno and Sack), TCP goodput increases as the number of burst assemblers per <b>egress</b> <b>node</b> is increased for an OBS network employing timer-based assembly algorithm. The improvement from one burstifier to moderate number of burst assemblers is significant (15 - 50 % depending on the burst loss probability, per-hop processing delay, and the TCP version), but the goodput difference between moderate number of buffers and per-flow aggregation is relatively small, implying that an OBS edge switch should use moderate number of assembly buffers per destination for enhanced TCP performance without substantially increasing the hardware complexity. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|E

Such approaches aim to minimize network delay, increase capacity, and enhance security services between two core (relay) network nodes, an ingress node and an <b>egress</b> <b>node.</b> MATE (Multipath Adaptive Traffic Engineering) has been proposed for multipath adaptive traffic engineering between an ingress node (source) and an <b>egress</b> <b>node</b> (destination) to distribute the network flow among multiple disjoint paths. Its novel idea is to avoid network congestion and attacks that might exist in edge and node disjoint paths between two core network nodes. This paper proposes protection schemes over asymmetric channels. Precisely, the paper aims to develop an adaptive, robust, and reliable traffic engineering scheme to improve performance and reliability of communication networks. This scheme will also provision Quality of Server (QoS) and protection of traffic engineering to maximize network efficiency. Specifically, S-MATE (secure MATE) is proposed to protect the network traffic between two core nodes (routers, switches, etc.) in a cloud network. S-MATE secures against a single link attack/failure by adding redundancy in one of the operational redundant paths between the sender and receiver nodes. It is also extended to secure against multiple attacked links. The proposed scheme can be applied to secure core networks such as optical and IP networks.

They cause degrading {{the performance of the}} network, and disturbing the continuous communication process. To overcome these issues, one step towards this dilemma has been taken in form of Pre-congestion notification (PCN) technique. PCN uses a packet marking technique within a PCN domain over IP networks. It is notified by <b>egress</b> <b>node</b> that works as guard at entry point of network. <b>Egress</b> <b>node</b> gives feedback to communicating servers whether rate on the link is exceeded than configured admissible threshold or within the limit. Based on this feedback, admission decisions are taken to determine whether to allow/block new coming flows or terminate already accepted. The actual question is about selection of right algorithm for PCN domain. In this paper, we investigate the analytical behavior of some known PCN algorithms. We make slide modifications in originality of PCN algorithms without disquieting working process in order to employ those within similar types of scenarios. Our goal is to simulate them either in highly congested or less congested realistic scenarios. On the basis of simulation done in ns 2, we are able to recommend each PCN algorithm for specific conditions. Finally, we develop a benchmark that helps researchers and scientific communities to pick the right algorithm. Furthermore, the benchmark is designed to achieve specific objectives according to the users' requirements without congesting the network.

S. ] - Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical and Computer EngineeringMobile ad-hoc {{networks}} are fast emerging {{and play a}} very important role in the field of wireless communications. With the advantages of mobility and infrastructure less the applications of ad-hoc networks have increased drastically. There are different routing protocols specifically designed for ad-hoc networks. Some examples of these routing protocols are DSDV, DSR AODV and DSR. Each of the routing protocols proposed for ad-hoc networks has its own advantages. For example DSDV is best suited for small scale ad-hoc networks and the design principles are very simple and are not very efficient when there is mobility {{and the size of the}} network increases. AODV and DSR are on-demand routing protocols and are best suited for large networks and also when a lot of mobility is involved among the wireless nodes in the network. Thus it is not possible to define a single routing protocol that would best suite all ad-hoc networks. The selection of a routing protocol purely depends on the application and also the scalability of the network. Having said that there cannot be a single routing protocol for all kinds of ad-hoc network this thesis concentrates on the concept of having interoperability between ad-hoc routing protocols. This thesis proposes a methodology which involves defining a universal packet which would be understood by all routing protocols. The design of having interoperability between the ad-hoc routing protocol involves three phases namely Bootstrap Phase, Route Discovery Phase and Data Exchange Phase. The method involved does not propose any changes to the existing protocols but an addition of universal packet format which would be understood by all routing protocols. Having discussed the proposed methodology for having interoperability between ad-hoc routing protocols this thesis discuses a mathematical model to calculate the maximum time involved in the Bootstrap Phase and the Route Discovery phase.
