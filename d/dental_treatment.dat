5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent drug use makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many drug users lack access to <b>dental</b> <b>treatment,</b> and few are willing to participate in such a course of action, often because of poverty. Those who are willing to seek <b>dental</b> <b>treatment</b> often resist discussing their drug use. Providing <b>dental</b> <b>treatment</b> to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E
5|$|Education about {{oral hygiene}} for {{long-term}} methamphetamine users is sometimes required. Changes in diet are often necessary for recovering drug users that are receiving <b>dental</b> <b>treatment,</b> {{and the use}} of sugar-free gum may be beneficial. The consumption of water and the avoidance of beverages with a diuretic (dehydrating) effect can also help patients with meth mouth.|$|E
5|$|For the dentist, {{the goal}} of {{treatment}} generally is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on {{the cause of the}} toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with <b>dental</b> <b>treatment,</b> will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as lidocaine and epinephrine is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a dental drill and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, tooth extraction, or debridement.|$|E

5|$|February saw the issuing of {{equipment}} and the commencement of training, however, this was punctuated by medical inspections and <b>dental</b> <b>treatment</b> as well as ceremonial duties surrounding the commemoration of the Treaty of Waitangi. A lack of previous experience in technical trades also hampered the training of the battalion, as the unit was short of men {{who were able to}} serve in roles such as clerks, drivers and signallers because the majority of personnel were drawn from mainly rural backgrounds. Consequently, men for these roles had to be trained from scratch. The organisation of the battalion was finally completed in March, when the men were allocated to their respective companies, and on 13 March 1940 the 28th (Māori) Battalion was declared on active service. After 14 days leave, the battalion conducted a five-week concentration period before embarking on 1 May 1940. The battalion's strength at this time was 39 officers and 642 other ranks.|$|E
5|$|Non-dental {{sources of}} pain often cause {{multiple}} teeth to hurt {{and have an}} epicenter that is either above or below the jaws. For instance, cardiac pain (which can make the bottom teeth hurt) usually radiates up from the chest and neck, and sinusitis (which can make the back top teeth hurt) is worsened by bending over. As all of these conditions may mimic toothache, {{it is possible that}} <b>dental</b> <b>treatment,</b> such as fillings, root canal treatment, or tooth extraction may be carried out unnecessarily by dentists in an attempt to relieve the individual's pain, and as a result the correct diagnosis is delayed. A hallmark {{is that there is no}} obvious dental cause, and signs and symptoms elsewhere in the body may be present. As migraines are typically present for many years, the diagnosis is easier to make. Often the character of the pain is the differentiator between dental and non-dental pain.|$|E
5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other <b>dental</b> <b>treatment,</b> and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Dental {{anxiety is}} a common problem in {{pediatric}} dentistry and results in behaviors like fear and anger that can negatively affect <b>dental</b> <b>treatments.</b> Exposure to various <b>dental</b> <b>treatments</b> and distressful experiences are reasons for anxiety during <b>dental</b> <b>treatments.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate effect of cognitive behavioral interventions in reduction of stress during dental procedures in children. Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial, 42 boys and girls, undergoing <b>dental</b> <b>treatments</b> were selected from dental clinics in Tehran. Patients were assigned to cognitive-behavioral interventions, placebo and control conditions. The fear scale, anger facial scale, pain facial scale and physiologic measure of pulse beat were evaluated. One way ANOVA and Tukey test were used to analyze the results and p&lt; 0. 05 was the level of significance. Results: Results showed significant differences between cognitive-behavioral interventions, placebo and control groups regarding fear, anger, pain and pulse beat. Comparison tests revealed that cognitive-behavioral interventions were more effective in reducing fear, anger, pain and pulse beat compared to the placebo or control. Conclusion: According to the results of this study cognitive-behavioral interventions can be used to reduce distress of children undergoing dental procedures...|$|R

5|$|Toothache {{may occur}} at any age, in any gender {{and in any}} {{geographic}} region. Diagnosing and relieving toothache {{is considered one of}} the main responsibilities of dentists. Irreversible pulpitis is thought to be the most common reason that people seek emergency <b>dental</b> <b>treatment.</b> Since dental caries associated with pulpitis is the most common cause, toothache is more common in populations that are at higher risk of dental caries. The prevalence of caries in a population is dependent upon factors such as diet (refined sugars), socioeconomic status, and exposure to fluoride (such as areas without water fluoridation). In the United States, an estimated 12% of the general population reported that they suffered from toothache at some point in the six months before questioning. Individuals aged 18–34 reported much higher experience of toothache than those aged 75 or over. In a survey of Australian schoolchildren, 12% had experienced toothache before the age of five, and 32% by the age of 12. Dental trauma is extremely common and tends to occur more often in children than adults.|$|E
5|$|Accrington Stanley {{accepted}} an undisclosed bid from Wrexham in July 2005, {{which included a}} sell-on clause and a bonus if he returned to play international football. He scored on his debut in a friendly against UEFA Champions League winners Liverpool in the 4–3 defeat after he came on as a substitute. McEvilly suffered a stress fracture in a metatarsus bone on his right foot in the 1–1 home draw with Notts County on 11 December, although he declared himself fit to play their following game against Carlisle United, he was substituted after 45 minutes after receiving a mouth injury which had required temporary dental surgery the same evening. His foot injury was later operated on and he received further <b>dental</b> <b>treatment.</b> His return to the Wrexham team following his injury was on 9 April 2006, in their 2–1 home defeat to Shrewsbury Town when he came on as a substitute replacing Matt Crowell in the 45th minute. He made a further three appearances scoring one goal, before breaking the same bone again in mid-April sidelining him {{until the end of}} the season. During the 2005–06 season, McEvilly made a total of 23 appearances for Wrexham, scoring seven goals in League Two.|$|E

40|$|Background/purpose: The {{behavioral}} control of child patients {{is an important}} issue in pediatric dentistry. The emotional states of the mothers of patients may influence the attitudes of their children. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the emotional states estimated from physiological responses of child patients and the subjective anxieties of their mothers during <b>dental</b> <b>treatments</b> and discuss the emotional relationships between children and their mothers. Materials and methods: To assess physiological responses associated with emotional changes induced by <b>dental</b> <b>treatments</b> in child patients aged 3 – 6 years, activity in the autonomic nervous were analyzed from variations in inter-beat intervals in electrocardiogram. Anxiety levels of accompanying mothers were examined using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, which was filled out during the treatment of their child. Results: Regarding the stress of child patients from the aspect of autonomic nervous activities during <b>dental</b> <b>treatments,</b> comparison between the cooperative and uncooperative patient groups showed that the uncooperative group demonstrated significantly higher sympathetic nervous activity and significantly lower parasympathetic nervous activity relative to the cooperative group, and their accompanying mothers showed significantly higher state anxiety scores relative to the mothers of cooperative children. Moreover, positive correlation between state anxiety scores of mothers and sympathetic nervous activities of their children was observed. Conclusion: These results indicated that uncooperative child patients undergo more stress and their mothers feel more anxiety from <b>dental</b> <b>treatments,</b> resulting in an emotional relationship between children and their mothers, which requires dental professionals to make special considerations to calm the anxiety of the mother, as well as the stress of the child patient...|$|R

25|$|Eating rough foods (e.g., crisps) {{can damage}} {{the lining of the}} mouth. Some people cause damage inside their mouths themselves, either through an absentminded habit or as a type of {{deliberate}} self-harm (factitious ulceration). Examples include biting the cheek, tongue, or lips, or rubbing a fingernail, pen, or toothpick inside the mouth. Tearing (and subsequent ulceration) of the upper labial frenum may be a sign of child abuse (non-accidental injury). Iatrogenic ulceration can also occur during <b>dental</b> <b>treatment,</b> when incidental abrasions to the soft tissues of the mouth are common. Some dentists apply a protective layer of petroleum jelly to the lips before carrying out dental work to minimize the number of incidental injuries.|$|E
