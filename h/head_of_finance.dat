25|$|Thiers {{had been}} {{considered}} a leftist republican {{in the government of}} Louis-Philippe, but after the political earthquake of the 1848 revolution and the influx of new deputies, he appeared relatively conservative. While {{he was out of the}} Assembly, he published an essay in defense of capitalism and private property which won him the support of the French business community and middle class. Thiers took his seat as the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finance</b> Committee, and leader of the conservative republicans. In the tense and sometimes violent political climate, he took up the habit of always carrying a loaded pistol.|$|E
2500|$|Yim Maukun {{was born}} during World War II in Changde, Xiangxi, in Hunan {{province}} {{in south central}} China. [...] Hunan had been invaded by the Japanese during the war, first in 1939 but only successfully in 1945 {{near the end of}} the conflict. [...] As Mao Zedong’s native province, Hunan had long been an active Communist area, including the site of a short-lived soviet in the early 1930s, but both sides of Yim’s family consisted of members of the educated, property-owning (if not wealthy) class. [...] Beyond that, Yim’s father (Ran Peng 冉鵬) was a prominent official in the Nationalist government, as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> and transportation.|$|E
6000|$|The {{reception}} of the bill by the organs of Irish opinion was easy to foretell. The nationalists accepted it in sober and rational language, subject to amendments on the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> and the constabulary clauses. The tories {{said it was a}} bill for setting up an Irish republic. It is another selfish English plan, said the moderates. Some Irishmen who had played with home rule while it was a phrase, drew back when they saw it in a bill. Others, while holding to home rule, objected to being reduced to the status of colonists. The body of home rulers who were protestant was small, and even against them it was retorted that for every protestant nationalist there were ten catholic unionists. The Fenian organs across the Atlantic, while quarrelling with such provisions as the two orders, “one of which would be Irish and the other English,” did justice to the bravery of the attempt, and to the new moral forces which it would call out. The florid violence which the Fenians abandoned was now with proper variations adopted by Orangemen in the north. The General Assembly of the presbyterian church in Ireland passed strong resolutions against a parliament, in favour of a peasant proprietary, in favour of loyalty, and of coercion. A few days later the general synod of the protestant episcopal church followed suit, and denounced a parliament. The Orange print in Belfast drew up a Solemn League and Covenant for Ulster, to ignore and resist an Irish national government. Unionist prints in Dublin declared and indignantly repelled “the selfish English design {{to get rid of the}} Irish nuisance from Westminster, and reduce us to the position of a tributary dependency.”(203) ...|$|E
