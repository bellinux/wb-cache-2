The xenoliths include three two-pyroxene garnet granulites, one garnet granulite lacking orthopyroxene, three felsic garnet granulites, one <b>kinzigite</b> and one amphibolized garnet granulite. Most of them are clearly distinct from the local upper crustal lithologies and have pressure and temperature estimates indicative of derivation from the lower crust. Zircons from these granulites show a record of several magmatic and metamorphic events, with different domains revealed by CL imaging and variations in REE content and Th/U ratios. The first event is shown by magmatic zircon in the cores of some grains that yield discordant Archaean to Proterozoic ages. All other domains of the studied zircons have textures typical for metamorphic zircons. They have Proterozoic ages and were formed by subsolidus growth or as a result of solid-state recrystallization of pre-existing zircon. They give a range of concordant ages from 1. 94 to 1. 81 Ga, in which several distinct episodes can be distinguished that relate to the collision of terranes during the accretion of the Siberian craton, accompanied by formation of granite melts.

The age of the intrusion is still debated because the results of geochronological studies in the last three decades on different rock types and with various dating techniques range from 250 to about 300 Ma. Sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) U^Pb zircon age determinations on 12 samples from several locations within the Mafic Complex were performed to better constrain the age of the igneous event. The results indicate a long history of magma emplacement and cooling, which reconciles the spread in previously published ages. The main intrusive phase took place at 2884 Ma, causing a perturbation of the deep-crustal geotherm, which relaxed to the Sm^Nd closure temperature in garnet-free mafic rocks after about 15 ^ 20 Myr of sub-solidus cooling at c. 270 Ma. These results suggest that large, deep crustal plutons, such as those identified geophysically at depths of 10 ^ 20 km within extended continental crust (e. g. Yellowstone, Rio Grande Rift, Basin and Range) may have formed rapidly but induced a prolonged thermal perturbation. In addition, the data indicate that a significant thermal event affected the country rock of the Mafic Complex at about 310 Ma. The occurrence of an upper amphibolite- to granulite-facies thermal event in the <b>Kinzigite</b> Formation prior to the main intrusive phase of the Mafic Complex has been postulated by several workers, and is corroborated by other geochronological investigations. However, it remains uncertain whether this event (1) was part of a prolonged perturbation of the deep-crustal geotherm, which started long before the onset of intrusion of the Mafic Complex, or (2) corresponded to the intrusion of the first sills of the Mafic Complex, or (3) was related to an earlier, independent thermal pulse...|$|E

Biotite abundance and the [Li] in metapelites correlate positively, reflecting the importance of Mg-bearing phyllosilicates in controlling the Li budget of the metapelites. Despite the loss of Li following biotite breakdown, there is no significant change in δ 7 Li, which averages− 1. 4 ± 2. 0 (2 σ, excluding an anomalously light sample) in the <b>kinzigites</b> (amphibolite facies) and + 0. 9 ± 2. 9 (2 σ) in the stronalites (granulite facies).

40|$|Abstract—This {{study is}} aimed at {{understanding}} the behavior of monazite, xenotime, apatite and zircon, and the redistribution of Zr, REE, Y, Th, and U among melt, rock-forming and accessory phases in a prograde metamorphic sequence, the <b>Kinzigite</b> Formation of Ivrea-Verbano, NW Italy, that may represent a section from the middle to lower continental crust. Metamorphism ranges from middle amphibolite to granulite facies and metapelites show evidence of intense partial melting and melt extraction. The appearance of melt controls the grain size, fraction of inclusions and redistribution of REE, Y, Th, and U among accessories and major minerals. The textural evolution of zircon and monazite follows, in general, the model of Watson et al. (1989). Apatite is extracted from the system dissolved into partial melts. Xenotime is consumed in garnet-forming reactions and is the first source for the elevated Y and HREE contents of garnet. Once xenotime is exhausted, monazite, apatite, zircon, K-feldspar, and plagioclase are progressively depleted in Y, HREE, and MREE as the modal abundance of garnet increases. Monazite is severely affected by two retrograde reactions, which may have consequences for U-Pb dating of this mineral. Granulite-grade metapelites (stronalites) ar...|$|E

These "young" dates, {{obtained}} in two different laboratories, do not comply with the geological constraints available for the study area that suggest an older age of the high pressure-low temperature (M 1) metamorphism. Nevertheless, the Sm/Nd age of the same rock at ca 358 Ma appears in better agreement with the geological constraints, and thus might reflect {{the age of the}} HP event. Similar 357 - 352 Ma monazite U-Th-Pbtot ages are obtained from relict grains in the Axial Zone <b>kinzigites</b> that represent restites enclosed in migmatites. Fur thermore, monazite grains from biotite-garnet-staurolite micaschists from the outer dome envelope, and Axial Zone <b>kinzigites,</b> yield U-Th-Pbtot ages ranging between 340 and 320 Ma. These dates are in good agreement with previously documented zircon and monazite ages from the migmatite and anatectic granites that represent a high temperature-low pressure (M 2) event. The significance of the zircon and rutile ages in the eclogites is discussed in terms of hydrothermal circulations.

At the regional scale, this anatectic domain {{is characterized by}} a progressive rotation of the flow direction from south to north, suggesting a 3 -D deformation of the anatectic middle crust. To better determine whether melt volumes present in the anatectic middle crust of the Araçuaí orogen were large enough to allow a combination of gravity-driven and convergence-driven deformation, we used the titanium-in-quartz (TitaniQ) geothermometer to estimate the crystallization temperatures of quartz grains in the anatectic rocks. When possible, we compared these estimates with thermobarometric estimates from traditional exchange geothermobarometers applied to neighboring migmatitic <b>kinzigites.</b> TitaniQ temperatures range from 750 to 900 °C, suggesting that quartz starts crystallizing at minimum temperatures of ≥ 800 °C. These results, combined with the bulk-rock chemical composition of diatexites, allows the estimation of a minimum of ~ 30 % melt and a corresponding viscosity of ~ 10 9 – 10 10 Pa s. Such a minimum melt content and low viscosity are in agreement with interconnected melt networks observed in the field. Considering that these characteristics are homogeneous over a wide area, this supports the finding that the strength of the middle crust was severely weakened by extensive partial melting, making it prone to gravity-driven flow and lateral extrusion...|$|R

Subsequent growth stages of zircon were distinguished by secondary electron (SEM) and cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging: (1) subsolidus growth producing round anhedral morphologies and sector zoning; (2) appearance of an intergranular fluid or melt phase at incipient dehydration melting that first resulted in resorption of pre-existing zircons, followed by growth of acicular zircons or overgrowths on round zircons consisting of planar growth zoning; (3) advanced melting producing euhedral prismatic zircons with oscillatory zoning overgrowing the sector zones. Two further lithologies, the Kaysersberg granite and the Trois-Epis units, were both formerly considered as migmatites. The intrusion of the Kaysersberg granite was dated at 325. 8 [*]±[*] 4. 8 [*]Ma.

40|$|A {{detailed}} textural and U-Pb geochronological {{investigation has}} been performed on zircons from a ductile shear zone established in lower crustal mafie intrusives.

Il developed al {{the base of the}} lower lo middle continental crust section, where mafie lo ultramafic rocks intruded into a sequence of metapelites and metabasites (i. e., <b>Kinzigite</b> Formation) constituting the polymetamorphic basement of the Adria plate. The shear zone forms a braided belt that can be followed for several km, from the Cannobino River lo the MI. Gridone, and developed entirely within gabbroic/dioritic rocks, partly intruded during Triassic lime (- 232 Ma; Zanetti et al., 2013). The shear zone is characterized by a well-developed foliation, a lineation, and a compositional banding, where amphibole, clinopyroxene and game! occur as large rounded lo elliptical porphyroclasts, resulting embedded in a fine grained matrix mainly consisting of plagioclase, amphibole, pyroxenes and ilmenite. The shear zone was active during uplift and cooling of the wall rock, and recorded retrograde metamorphic conditions ranging from 650 lo 500 "C al 0. 6 - 0. 4 GPa (Kenkmann, 2000). The mylonitic deformation is generally placed no earlier !han 230 Ma, lasting until about 170 Ma al the latest (e. g., Handy & Zingg, 1991). Numerous zircon grains were obtained from the minerai separation of one (- 2 kg weight) sample collected in the Cannobino River (northem Ivrea-Verbano Zone, Southern Alps). Zircon grains were examined also directly on petrographic lhin sections of samples collected throughout the (ultra) mylonitic belt. According to petrographic and microstructural analyses zircon occurs as rounded grains within the mylonitic matrix, easily recognisable due lo their dimensions up lo 110 micron. Cathodoluminescence (CL) study al the SEM revealed a well developed systematic zoning of zircon grains with dark cores surrounded by brighter domains, locally asymmetric, and with a thickness up to 30 micron. The dark inner core can show zoning features suggesting magmatic growlh. Preliminary LA-ICP-MS U-Pb results from zircon separates yielded mainly late Triassic concordant ages of about 235 Ma for the dark CL cores and about 204 Ma for the brighter CL (mylonitic) overgrowths. The sizes, distributions, shapes and CL features of zircon grains provide strong evidence of a metamorphic response of zircon during ductile deformation. The observed features can be interpreted as evidence of dissolution/recrystallization in response lo fluid influx during high-temperature shearing. Further microstructural investigations, minerai chemistry and trace element characterization of different zircon domains are in progress and will provide more evidence for the petrochronological evolution of such a lower crustal shear zone...|$|E
40|$|The mafic-ultramafic Finero complex {{represents}} the northernmost sectorof the Ivrea-Verbano Zone (IVZ), Southern Alps. It {{consists of a}} mantlebody, surrounded by a mafic-ultramafic intrusive sequence [1],documenting an association of mantle and crustal rocks inferred to beplaced {{at the bottom of}} the continental crust of the Adria plate before theopening of Ligurian-Piedmontese branch of the Jurassic neo-Tethys. Nevertheless, the Finero complex shows several tectonic andpetrochemical differences with respect to those of the central IVZ. Forinstance, published geochronological U-Pb zircon data constrain theemplacement of the Mafic Complex in the central sector of the IVZ at 280 -to- 295 Ma ([2] and references therein). Conversely, the intrusion ageof almost part of the Mafic Complex in the Finero area (SHRIMP U-Pbzircon dating) indicate that the External Gabbro, the largest unit formingthe Finero Mafic Complex, intruded the bottom of the <b>Kinzigite</b> Formationduring Ladinian [3]. A Triassic ages have been also determined for themultiple metasomatic and intrusive events affecting the associated mantlebody ([4] and references therein). This is mainly formed by harzburgitemodally enriched in phlogopite and amphibole and with large LILEcontents. Based on the geochemical and isotopic composition, severalauthors proposed that the growth of phlogopite-bearing assemblages wasrelated to the migration of melts containing significant crustal-derivedcomponents. With the aim to place constraints on the timing of meltmigration through the Finero mantle body, zircons were separated fromthree, dm-thick chromitite bands enclosed in huge dunite bodiesoutcropping along the Cannobino River and on the Mt. Sasso Rosso. U-PbELA-ICP-MS data result in concordant ages comprised in the range of 188 - 186 Ma, which is believed to date the segregation of the chromititebands during channeled porous-flow melt migration. These ages aresignificantly younger than that determined through conventionalmultigrain dating by [4], whose data define an intercept Triassic age of 208 ± 2 Ma. Although the studied chromitite bands do not show primaryphlogopite, the major and trace element mineral chemistry point to acognate origin with the migrating melts forming the phlogopiteharzburgite. The finding that the porous-flow ascent of LILE-enrichedmelts through the Finero mantle unit postdates the emplacement of theFinero Mafic Complex, and the absence in the latter of the record of thismagmatic stage, suggest that the Finero mantle unit might have beenemplaced tectonically in contact with the lower crust at some time afterlower Jurassic. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that thecontact between mantle unit and Mafic Complex is always tectonic. As awhole these data confirm that the northernmost part of the IVZ,represented by the Finero complex, cannot be longer considered as a partof the central IVZ, thus suggesting that the entire geological setting of thearea should be revised...|$|E
40|$|Whole-rock Nd and Sr isotopic {{compositions}} of the mafic-ultramafic complex near Finero {{demonstrate that}} the magma was derived from a depleted, perhaps MORE-type mantle reservoir. The Sm-Nd data for the Amphibole Peridotite unit {{can be interpreted as}} an isochron with an apparent age of 533 +/- 20 Ma, which is consistent with a Pb- 207 /Pb- 206 evaporation age of 549 +/- 12 Ma of a single zircon grain from the Internal Gabbro unit. However, the interpretation of these apparent ages remains open to question. We therefore retain the alternative hypotheses that the intrusion occurred either about 533 or 270 Ma ago, the latter bring the most likely age of emplacement of the much larger magma body near Balmuccia (Val Sesia). The implication of the older emplacement age (if correct) would be that the igneous complex {{may be related to the}} numerous amphibolite units, which are intercalated with the metapelites of the overlying <b>Kinzigite</b> Formation, and together with them may constitute an accretionary complex. In this ease, the mafic-ultramafic complex itself might also be part of such an accretionary complex (as has been proposed for the Balmuccia peridotite). Internal Sm-Nd isochrons involving grt, cpx, plag and amph from the Internal Gabbro unit yield concordant ages of 231 +/- 23, 226 +/- 7, 223 +/- 10, 214 +/- 17, and 203 +/- 13 Ma. These results confirm published evidence for a separate, regional heating event about 215 +/- 15 Ma ago. Initial epsilon(Nd) (533) values average + 6. 3 +/- 0. 4 for six samples of the Amphibole Peridotite unit and + 6. 0 +/- 1. 2 for ten samples of the External Gabbro unit. Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 ratios require little or no age correction and range from 0. 7026 to 0. 7047 (with two outliers at 0. 7053 and 0. 7071). Strong correlations between Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 and K 2 O and weaker correlations between initial epsilon(Nd) and K 2 O imply a comparatively minor (less than or equal to 10 %) contamination of the External Gabbro magma by crustal material and a later alteration by a crustal or seawater-derived fluid. These results contrast sharply with the isotopic composition (negative epsilon(Nd) and high Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 values) of the associated mantle rocks, the Phlogopite Peridotite unit, which has been pervasively metasomatized by crustal fluids. This type of metasomatism and its isotopic signature are never seen in the magmatic complex. This evidence rules out any direct genetic relationship between the igneous complex and the mantle peridotite. The crust-mantle interaction is the opposite of that seen at Balmuccia, where the mantle peridotite is essentially ´pristine´ and the magmatic body has been extensively contaminated by assimilation of crustal rocks...|$|E

The {{east to west}} thrusting observed in the whole belt is strongly perturbed by vertical movements attributed to the ascent of anatectic granites in the high-T area. The field reconstruction of subvertical, closed elliptical structures in gneisses and migmatites, associated with the subhorizontal, doubly radial pattern of stretching lineation in the mica schists, suggests {{the existence of an}} elliptical diapiric body buried at depth beneath the present erosion level. Deformation is associated with a complex P-T evolution partly recorded in aluminous gneisses (<b>kinzigites,</b> e. g. morbihanites). A chronology of successive episodes of mineral growth at different compositions is established by detailed studies of the mineral-microstructure relationships in X-Z sections, using the deformation-partitioning concept (low- and high-strain zones). Several thermometric and barometric calibrations are applied to mineral pairs either in contact or not in contact but in equivalent microstructiiral positions with respect to the deformation history. This methodology provides a continuous microstructural control of P-T variations through time and leads to three P-T-t-d paths constructed from numerous successive P-T estimations. Path 1 is a clockwise retrograde path preserved in low-strain zones, which records general exhumation movements after crustal thickening. Paths 2 and 3 are clockwise prograde/retrograde paths from high-strain zones; they are interpreted and discussed in the light of models of crustal anatexis and upward movement of magma (diapirism). Deformation and P-T effects induced by diapirism can be distinguished from the general deformation-metamorphic history of a belt, and would seem to be produced during a late stage of its history. The present microstructural-petrological approach to defining successive mineral equilibria in relation to progressive deformation steps provides a far more accurate evaluation of the metamorphic evolution than is possible by ‘standard’thermobarometry...|$|R

The work of this thesis focuses on the investigation of metapelitic <b>Kinzigites</b> from the Ivrea-Verbano Zone (Italy) and migmatitic paragneisses from Kaligandaki Valley (Central Nepal) and on the characterization of melt inclusions found in peritectic garnet from these rocks. In both cases inclusions are very small (< 15 m), polycrystalline aggregates of quartz + feldspar + micas (“nanogranites”); no finding of glassy inclusions was observed. Quantitative analysis of the polycrystalline inclusions was difficult to obtain due to analytical limits and sample preparation difficulty; in fact inclusions were often mechanically removed during polishing. The final {{aim of this study}} was the re-homogenization of the inclusions to obtain the bulk composition of the trapped melt: this was undertaken using both a high temperature and room pressure stage and a high pressure piston-cylinder. Usually anatectic melt composition is inferred from migmatitic leucosomes, that are affected by fractional crystallization and differentiation phenomena that can change the original composition, or assumed using experimental analogues that cannot totally reproduce natural processes; therefore the study of glassy or re-homogenized nanogranitic inclusions found in peritectic minerals can {{be the only way to}} obtain the bulk composition of the melt during anatexis. Heating stage experiments were not successful, since the inclusions showed evidences of decrepitation and oxidation (probably due to volatile loss) but did not melt at all. The inclusions were successfully re-melted at 900 ° C and 8 Kbar using a piston cylinder apparatus, proving they are nanogranites trapped within garnet during incongruent melting reactions. The melt obtained shows in both cases a granitic composition clearly affected by interactions with the host garnet (decrepitation, growth of peritectic orthopiroxene) due to over-heating, thus the data obtained cannot be used for quantitative interpretation. New experiments should be performed in the future at lower temperature and higher pressure to find the chemical composition of the melt and its trapping temperature. ...|$|R

Folate deficiency has been linked to risk of several cancers, but has not been studied adequately with respect to oral cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This case-control study, conducted in Italy and French-speaking Switzerland, included 749 patients with incident cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, and 1772 hospital controls with acute, non-neoplastic conditions. The interviews used a validated food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: The ORs were 0. 68 (95 % CI 0. 52 - 0. 88) for the intermediate tertile and 0. 53 (95 % CI 0. 40 - 0. 69) for the highest tertile of dietary folate intake, compared with the lowest tertile. No heterogeneity was found in strata of gender, age, methionine intake or alcohol consumption. The combined OR for low-folate and high-alcohol intake versus high-folate and low-alcohol intake was 22. 3 (95 % CI 13. 1 - 38). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports a protective role of folate against oral and pharyngeal carcinogenesis. Compared with low folate intake, a consistent reduction in risk was already observed from intermediate levels of intake, suggesting that cancer risk may be related to relative folate deficiency.

(1977), is further subdivided into the three following units: a) an Internal Unit characterized by eo-Alpine high pressure (HP) assemblages (DAL PIAZ et al., 1972) (Eclogitic Micaschists); b) an Intermediate Unit where HP parageneses are partially re-equilibrated under greenschist conditions and c) an External Unit where the main foliation is defined by a greenschist paragenesis (Gneiss Minuti auct.). 2) the Monometamorphic Cover Complex, subdivided into the followings: a) the Bonze Unit, composed of sheared metagabbros, eclogitized metabasalts with MORB geochemical affinity and related metasediments (micaschists, quartzites and Mn-cherts) and b) the Scalaro Unit, containing predominantly metasediments of supposed Permo-Triassic age (yellow dolomitic marbles, calcschists and conglomeratic limestones, micaschists and quartzites with thin levels of basic rocks with within plate basalts [WPB] geochimical affinity). Multiple lithostratigraphic sequences for the Monometamorphic Cover Complex are proposed. The contact between the Bonze and Scalaro Units is defined by repetitions of dolomitic marbles and metabasalts; the ages of the metasediments have been assigned solely by analogy with other sediments of the Western Alps, due to the absence of fossils. The Monometamorphic Cover Complex can be considered as the autochthonous cover of the Sesia Lanzo Zone because of the primary contacts with the basement and because of the presence of preAlpine HT basement blocks in the cover sequences. 3) The pre-Alpine high temperature (HT) Basement Complex (or `'Seconda Zona Diorito-Kinzigitica''), comprises HT Hercynian rocks like <b>kinzigites,</b> amphibolites, granulites and calcite marbles; this Complex is always located between the Internal and the External Units and can be followed continuously for several kilometers south of the Gressoney Valley to the Orco Valley. A schematic evolution for the Sesia Lanzo Zone is proposed; based on available data together with new geochronological data, this study shows that the internal and external parts of the polymetamorphic basement of the Sesia Zone experienced different cooling histories...|$|R
40|$|The Ivrea-Verbano Zone (IVZ, Southern Alps), in {{northern}} Italy, {{is part of}} the pre-Alpine basement characterized by the exposure of a well-preserved lower crustal section. The middle-lower crustal rocks of the IVZ have commonly been subdivided in three major units, from bottom to top: i) different ultramafic mantle bodies; ii) the Mafic Complex (MC), which represents an intrusive complex (gabbros, norites and diorites); iii) the <b>Kinzigite</b> Formation (KF), consisting of amphibolite- to granulite-facies metapelites with subordinate metabasites, marbles and calc-silicate gneisses. U-Pb zircon data on the MC indicate an emplacement at 295 - 280 Ma in the central sector of the IVZ (Peressini et al., 2007, and references therein) and at about 232 Ma in the north-eastern sector (External Gabbro, Finero Complex; Zanetti et al., 2013). The Permian intrusion was coeval with granite intrusions in the middle-upper crust and rhyolitic volcanism, while the Triassic intrusion was concurrent with the activity of (low-/high-temperature) shear zones. In order to shed light on the observed diachronism of the MC and to provide useful insights on the tectonic evolution, new P-T-t data from the KF exposed in the Val Cannobina (Cursolo-Orasso area) were carried out. Here, the KF shows the narrowest thickness and is partially affected by mylonitic deformation. It mainly consists of micaschists and migmatitic paragneisses, dominant at the higher structural levels (SE), and amphibolites, prevailing at the contact with the MC (lower structural levels; NW; Boriani & Burlini, 1995). Septa, both mafic and metapelitic in composition, occur within the MC and show granulite-facies metamorphism. Metapelites are mainly composed of Pl, Qtz, Bt, Grt and Sil. With increasing the metamorphic grade (towards NW), the abundance of Bt decreases, that of Grt increases andfibrolitic Sil is progressively replaced by prismatic Sil. Preliminary P-T estimates on metapelites indicate P of about 0. 4 GPa and T ranging from 620 to 700 °C. The septa show T higher than 800 °C. Preliminary U-Pb dates on monazite fromthe migmatitic paragneisses zone indicate that an HT metamorphic event occurred at about 277 Ma, coherently with other areas of the IVZ. A single age at 225 ± 7 Ma obtained from a narrow rim suggests a later perturbation of the U-Pb system. Boriani A. & Burlini L. 1995. Carta Geologica della Valle Cannobina. Scala 1 : 25000.

Apart from petrology and geochemistry of the mantle peridotites (e. g. the strong metasomatism of Finero is absent in Balmuccia), the Finero region {{differs from the}} rest of the complex in stratigraphy, lithology and geochemistry of the mafic intrusives, and their relationships with the <b>Kinzigite</b> Formation, the metamorphic sequence into which the MC intruded. We give new evidence for a substantial difference also in the age of magmatism. The age of emplacement of the MC in the Val Sesia area has been recently proved to be homogeneous, between 283 and 289 Ma, after a thermal, upper-amphibolite event that affected the country rock at 320 -to- 310 Ma. At Finero, published Sm-Nd isochrones span 203 - 533 Ma, zircon ages span 208 - 549 Ma (Lu et al, 1997, Chem. Geol. 140, 223 - 235, Grieco et al, 2001, J. Pet. 52, 89 - 101). The more composite nature of the Finero sector is possibly hiding a more articulated geological evolution of the MC, as suggested by the presence of numerous high-T shear-zones (e. g., Kenkmann, 2000, J. Struc. Geol. 22, 471 - 487, Manckeltow etal., 2002, J. Struc. Geol. 24, 567 - 585, and ref. therein). We performed a detailed zircon study on samples from the External Gabbro unit of the complex, most of which have a homogeneous population of colorless zircons. The key for interpretation is one sample, bearing both magmatic, subeuhedral, pink crystals with oscillatory zoning in CL, and detrital zircons, rounded, small, colorless grains with blurred CL-patterns. The three events recorded by these zircons are clearly recognizable in CL, and were dated with SHRIMP U-Pb analyses. Magmatic growth of the zircons took place at 232 +/- 2 Ma and was overprinted at 214 +/- 5 Ma by a second event, dated by the rim-recrystallization ages. A 280 -to- 310 Ma age peak is clearly, though imprecisely constrained by the colorless zircons, proving that older ages are preserved, but must be considered detrital. Two problems arise: reason and significance of the older age peak. Together with the positive correlation between zircon yield and degree of crustal contamination (Nd-Sr isotopic compositions) of the studied samples, the U-Pb data allow to conclude that zircons and zirconium were inherited/digested from the country rock. The latter underwent a major event that reset the U-Pb system in zircon around 300 Ma, compatible with both magmatic and metamorphic ages in the MC of the Balmuccia sector. In the External Gabbro, though, no magmatic Carboniferous or Permian zircon was found: emplacement took place at 232 Ma, and a separate thermal event is dated at 214 Ma. The new data extend as far west as the Ivrea zone the evidence of the important Mesozoic magmatism of the central and eastern South Alpine. Mesozoic igneous activity in the Finero region is clearly distinct from the predominating Permo-Carboniferous magmatism in the Ivrea-Verbano Zone. Also, as for most gabbroic intrusions in the alpine-appenine system, ages in the Ivrea Zone cluster in two ranges, at either 285 - 310 Ma, or at 200 - 250 Ma. This distribution is thoroughly represented in the zircons from one sample only, the ages of which represent distinct episodes of heating, melting and metasomatism...|$|E
