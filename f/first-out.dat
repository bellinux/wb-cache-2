5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{may involve}} exploiting {{opportunities to make}} accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the financial statements. Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for uncollectible accounts can {{have a significant effect}} on net income, and a company using last-in, <b>first-out</b> accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods.|$|E
2500|$|In China, an {{algorithm}} {{which adds}} a first-in <b>first-out</b> queue to the Bellman-Ford algorithm, known as SPFA, published by Fanding Duan in 1994, is popular {{with students who}} take part in [...] and ACM-ICPC.|$|E
50|$|The term {{may have}} been derived from last-in, <b>first-out</b> (LIFO) or first-in, <b>first-out</b> (FIFO).|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, {{the queue}} number of a graph is a graph {{invariant}} defined analogously to stack number (book thickness) using first-in <b>first-out</b> (queue) orderings {{in place of}} last-in <b>first-out</b> (stack) orderings.|$|E
50|$|A <b>first-out</b> alarm is {{an alarm}} that {{indicates}} in some manner {{that it was}} the first of a series. This is necessary in circumstances such as an automatic trip or shutdown of equipment, where many alarms will announce as a result of a shutdown. The <b>first-out</b> alarm will clearly identify the root cause of the trip or shutdown.|$|E
50|$|A queue is a first-in <b>first-out</b> list. Variations are Deque and Priority queue.|$|E
50|$|A food {{rotation}} {{system is a}} front-loading shelving unit that organizes and rotates food cans on a first-in <b>first-out</b> basis (FIFO). An effective food {{rotation system}} is essential for storing food to prepare for catastrophes, preventing foodborne illness and controlling commercial kitchen costs. When used correctly, the first-in <b>first-out</b> food rotation method ensures serving safe food and eliminates spoiled food waste.|$|E
5000|$|Below is the pseudo-code of the algorithm. Here Q is a first-in, <b>first-out</b> queue of {{candidate}} vertices, and w(u, v) is the edge weight of (u, v).|$|E
50|$|Gallium-contained alloys have a {{specific}} shelf life and should be managed as a first-in, <b>first-out</b> (FIFO) product. Packaging should be labeled with date and time of opening.|$|E
50|$|In Dennis Lindley's first {{paper on}} the subject the {{equation}} is used to describe waiting times experienced by customers in a queue with the First-In <b>First-Out</b> (FIFO) discipline.|$|E
50|$|CDMI {{supports}} {{the concept of}} persistent FIFO (first-in, <b>first-out)</b> queues. These are useful for job scheduling, order processing and other tasks in which lists of things must be processed in order.|$|E
5000|$|One {{advantage}} of a ticket lock over other spinlock algorithms {{is that it is}} fair. The waiting threads are processed in a first-in <b>first-out</b> basis as the dequeue ticket integer increases, thus preventing starvation.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "stack machine" [...] is a {{computer}} that uses a last-in, <b>first-out</b> stack to hold short-lived temporary values. Most of its instructions assume that operands will be from the stack, and results placed in the stack.|$|E
50|$|First-In <b>First-Out</b> (FIFO) {{assumes that}} the items {{purchased}} or produced first are sold first. Costs of inventory per unit or item are determined at the time made or acquired. The oldest cost (i.e., the first in) is then matched against revenue and assigned to cost of goods sold.|$|E
50|$|The {{communications}} segment offers communication clocks, serial RapidIO {{solutions for}} {{wireless base station}} infrastructure applications, radio frequency products, digital logic products, first-in and <b>first-out</b> (FIFO) memories, integrated communications processors, static random-access memory (SRAM) products, and telecommunications semiconductor products. This segment markets its products to the enterprise, data center, and wireless markets.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} storage, Bélády's anomaly is {{the phenomenon}} in which {{increasing the number}} of page frames results in {{an increase in the number}} of page faults for certain memory access patterns. This phenomenon is commonly experienced when using the first-in <b>first-out</b> (FIFO) page replacement algorithm. László Bélády demonstrated this in 1969.|$|E
5000|$|... "LIFO" [...] {{stands for}} last-in, <b>first-out,</b> {{meaning that the}} most {{recently}} produced items are recorded as sold first. Since the 1970s, some U.S. companies shifted towards the use of LIFO, which reduces their income taxes in times of inflation, but since International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) banned LIFO, more companies returned to FIFO.|$|E
5000|$|Most first-in <b>first-out</b> (FIFO) [...] {{storage devices}} are {{variable}}-length buffers {{in that the}} input rate may be variable while the output rate is constant or the output rate may be variable while the input rate is constant. Various clocking and control systems are used to allow control of underflow or overflow conditions.|$|E
5000|$|A switch may be {{composed}} of buffered input ports, a switch fabric and buffered output ports. If first-in <b>first-out</b> (FIFO) input buffers are used, only the oldest packet is available for forwarding. More recent arrivals cannot be forwarded if the oldest packet cannot be forwarded because its destination output is busy.The output may be busy if: ...|$|E
50|$|Some {{communications}} equipment manufacturers placed overly large buffers {{in some of}} their network products. In such equipment, bufferbloat occurs when a network link becomes congested, causing packets to become queued in buffers for too long. In a first-in <b>first-out</b> queuing system, overly large buffers result in longer queues and higher latency, and do not improve network throughput.|$|E
5000|$|Note {{also that}} this {{solution}} can only satisfy {{the condition that}} [...] "no thread shall be allowed to starve" [...] {{if and only if}} semaphores preserve first-in <b>first-out</b> ordering when blocking and releasing threads. Otherwise, a blocked writer, for example, may remain blocked indefinitely with a cycle of other writers decrementing the semaphore before it can.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "lower of cost or market" [...] is now {{obsolete}} and {{is officially}} replaced by [...] "lower of cost and net realizable value." [...] According to the FASB Accounting Standards Update, [...] "An entity should measure inventory {{within the scope}} of this Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation." [...] This FASB update makes usage consistent with the IFRS wording and removes the use of [...] "or" [...] in a context where [...] "and" [...] was always the correct one. However, the update does not apply to all companies. Companies that use the FIFO (first-in, <b>first-out)</b> and average-cost methods of inventory valuation are required to implement the changes, whereas companies that use the LIFO (last-in, <b>first-out)</b> and retail inventory methods are not affected by the update.|$|E
50|$|Free {{movement}} of stored materials, on a first-in, <b>first-out</b> basis, {{is essential in}} maximizing silo efficiency. The goal of silo efficiency {{is to ensure that}} oldest material is used first and does not contaminate newer, fresher material. Two main problems, rat holing and bridging, complicate silo efficiency. When rat holing occurs, powders adhere to the sides of silos. Bridging occurs when material blocks at the silo base.|$|E
50|$|Recursive functions, {{and block}} {{structured}} programs, {{with or without}} lifting, may be implemented using a stack based implementation, which is simple and efficient. However a stack frame based implementation must be strict (eager). The stack frame based implementation requires that the life of functions be last-in, <b>first-out</b> (LIFO). That is, the most recent function to start its calculation must {{be the first to}} end.|$|E
50|$|IAS 2 also {{requires}} {{the use of}} the First-in, <b>First-out</b> (FIFO) principle whereby those items which have been in stock the longest are considered to be the items that are being used first, ensuring that those items which are held in inventory at the reporting date are valued at the most recent price. As an alternative, costs of inventories may be assigned by using the weighted average cost formula.|$|E
5000|$|... "FIFO" [...] {{stands for}} first-in, <b>first-out,</b> {{meaning that the}} oldest {{inventory}} items are recorded as sold first but do {{not necessarily mean that}} the exact oldest physical object has been tracked and sold. In other words, the cost associated with the inventory that was purchased first is the cost expenses first. With FIFO, the cost of inventory reported on the balance sheet represents the cost of the inventory most recently purchased.|$|E
5000|$|In {{computer}} science, {{a command}} queue is a queue for enabling the delay of command execution, either {{in order of}} priority, on a first-in <b>first-out</b> basis, or in any order that serves the current purpose. Instead of waiting each command to be executed before sending the next one, the program just puts all the commands in the queue and goes on doing other things while the queue is processed by the executor component (e.g. hard drive).|$|E
50|$|Packet mode {{communication}} may {{be implemented}} {{with or without}} intermediate forwarding nodes (packet switches or routers). Packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, <b>first-out</b> buffering, but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing, traffic shaping, or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service, such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket. In case of a shared physical medium (such as radio or 10BASE5), the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme.|$|E
5000|$|It is a {{standard}} feature for a UART to store the most recent character while receiving the next. This [...] "double buffering" [...] gives a receiving computer an entire character transmission time to fetch a received character. Many UARTs have a small first-in, <b>first-out</b> FIFO buffer memory between the receiver shift register and the host system interface. This allows the host processor even more time to handle an interrupt from the UART and prevents loss of received data at high rates.|$|E
50|$|Earnings {{management}} {{may involve}} exploiting {{opportunities to make}} accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the financial statements. Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for uncollectible accounts can {{have a significant effect}} on net income, and a company using last-in, <b>first-out</b> accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods.|$|E
50|$|Costs are {{associated}} with particular goods {{using one of the}} several formulas, including specific identification, first-in <b>first-out</b> (FIFO), or average cost. Costs include all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs that are incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Costs of goods made by the businesses include material, labor, and allocated overhead. The costs of those goods which are not yet sold are deferred as costs of inventory until the inventory is sold or written down in value.|$|E
50|$|Devaynes v Noble (1816) 35 ER 781, {{best known}} for the claim {{contained}} in Clayton's case, created a rule, or rather common law presumption in relation to the distribution of monies from a bank account. The rule is based upon the deceptively simple notion of first-in, <b>first-out</b> to determine the effect of payments from an account, and will normally apply in the absence of evidence of any other intention. Payments are presumed to be appropriated to debts in the order in which the debts are incurred.|$|E
50|$|Assignment {{occurs when}} an option holder {{exercises}} his option by notifying his broker, who then notifies the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). The OCC fulfills the contract, then selects, randomly, a member firm who was short the same option contract. The OCC then notifies the firm. The firm then carries out its obligation, and then selects a customer, either randomly, first-in, <b>first-out,</b> {{or some other}} equitable method who was short the option, for assignment. That customer is assigned the exercise requiring him to fulfill the obligation that he agreed to when he wrote the option.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] {{interface}} {{defines the}} queue data structure, which stores {{elements in the}} order in which they are inserted. New additions go {{to the end of the}} line, and elements are removed from the front. It creates a first-in <b>first-out</b> system. This interface is implemented by , , and [...] LinkedList, of course, also implements the List interface and can also be used as one. But it also has the Queue methods. ArrayDeque implements the queue as an array. Both LinkedList and ArrayDeque also implement the [...] interface, giving it more flexibility.|$|E
50|$|Mura, {{in terms}} of business/process improvement, is avoided through Just-In-Time systems {{which are based on}} keeping little or no inventory. These systems supply the {{production}} process with the right part, at the right time, In the right amount, using first-in, <b>first-out</b> (FIFO) component flow. Just-In-Time systems create a “pull system” in which each sub-process withdraws its needs from the preceding sub-processes, and ultimately from an outside supplier. When a preceding process does not receive a request or withdrawal it does not make more parts. This type of system is designed to maximize productivity by minimizing storage overhead.|$|E
50|$|The {{performance}} of the algorithm is strongly determined by {{the order in which}} candidate vertices are used to relax other vertices. In fact, if Q is a priority queue, then the algorithm pretty much resembles Dijkstra's. However, since a priority queue is not used here, two techniques are sometimes employed {{to improve the quality of}} the queue, which in turn improves the average-case performance (but not the worst-case performance). Both techniques rearranges the order of elements in Q so that vertices closer to the source are processed first. Therefore, when implementing these techniques, Q is no longer a first-in, <b>first-out</b> queue, but rather a normal doubly linked list or double-ended queue.|$|E
