40|$|However, in a geometrically complex channel {{such as a}} cen-trifugal {{impeller}} blade passage, the streamwise direction can be defined in several different ways, and each definition will yield a slightly different result for the secondary flow. This problem has been pointed out by many previous authors. The purpose of the following discussion is to document the pro-cedure used to generate the secondary flow field results pre-sented in this paper. The same procedure is applied to both the computational and experimental results.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} modeling of nonreactive and nonlinearly sorbing solutes in groundwater {{and analysis of the}} effect of heterogeneity resulting from spatial variation of physical and chemical parameters on the transport of solutes. For this purpose, a hy­brid flux corrected transport (FCT) and central difference method based on operator-split approach is developed for advection-dispersion solute transport equation. The advective transport is solved using the FCT technique, while the dispersive transport is solved using a conventional, fully implicit, finite difference scheme. Three FCT methods are developed and extension to multidimensional cases are discussed. The FCT models developed are anlaysed using test problems possessing analyt­ical solutions for one and two dimensional cases, while analysing advection and dispersion dominated transport situations. Different initial and boundary conditions, which mimic the laboratory and field situations are analysed in order to study numerical dispersion, peak cliping and grid orientation. The developed models are tested to study their relative merits and weaknesses for various grid Peclet and Courant numbers. It is observed from the one dimensional results that all the FCT models perform well for continuous solute sources under varying degrees of Courant number restriction. For sharp solute pulses FCT 1 and FCT 3 methods fail to simulate the fronts for advection dominated situations even for mod­erate Courant numbers. All the FCT models can be extended to multidimensions using a dimensional-split approach while FCT 3 can be made fully multidimensional. It is observed that a dimensional-split approach allows use of higher Courant numbers while tracking the fronts accurately for the cases studied. The capability of the FCT 2 model is demonstrated in handling situations where the flow is not aligned along the <b>grid</b> <b>direction.</b> It is observed that FCT 2 method is devoid of grid orientation error, which is a common problem for many numerical methods based on Cartesian co-ordinate system. The hybrid FCT 2 numerical model which is observed to perform better among the three FCT models is extended to model transport of sorbing solutes. The present study analyses the case of nonlinear sorption with a view to extend the model for any reactive transport situation wherein the chemical reactions are nonlinear in nature. A two step approach is adopted in the present study for coupling the partial differential equation gov­erning the transport and the nonlinear algebraic equation governing the equilibrium sorp­tion. The suitability of explicit-implicit (EI - form) formulation for obtaining accurate solution coupling the transport equation with the nonlinear algebraic equation solved using a Newton-Raphson method is demonstrated. The performance of the numerical model is tested for a range of Peclet numbers for modelling self-sharpening and self-smearing con­centration profiles resulting from nonlinear sorption. It is observed that FCT 2 model based on this formulation simulates the fronts quite accurately for both advection and dispersion dominated situations. The delay in the solute mobility and additional dispersion are anal­ysed varying the statistical parameters characterising the heterogeneity namely, correlation scale and variance during the transport of solutes and comparisons are drawn with invariant, cases. The impact of dispersion during the heterogeneous transport is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Some {{computer}} programs {{based on the}} Aki-Christofferson-Husebye (ACH) method of teleseismic tomography contain an error caused by identifying local <b>grid</b> <b>directions</b> with azimuths on the spherical Earth. This error, which is most severe in high latitudes, introduces systematic errors into computed ray paths and distorts inferred Earth models. It is best dealt with by explicitly correcting for the difference between true and <b>grid</b> <b>directions.</b> Methods for computing these directions are pre-sented in this article {{and are likely to}} be useful in many other kinds of regional geophysical studies that use Cartesian coordinates and flat-earth approximations. The ACH Method The ACH method, developed by Aki, Christofferson, and Husebye (Aki et al., 1977) was the first application of tomography in seismology and has by now been used to study the three-dimensional structure of the crust and upper mantle beneath seismic arrays in dozens of places (Evans and Achauer, 1993). The method takes as input a collection of arrival-time residuals at the sensors of the array from a suite of distant earthquakes in various directions and gen-erates estimates of the wave speeds in a number of rectan-gular blocks under the array. We recently discovered, in a study of the structure be-neath Iceland (Foulger et al., 2000), that some computerized versions of the ACH method, including the program THRD (Evans and Achauer, 1993), contain an error in their treat-ment of azimuths, which increases with the size of the region under study and is particularly severe at high latitudes. This error leads to incorrect computed ray paths, which in turn distort the derived three-dimensional structure. This note ex-plains the origin and consequences of this error and presents ways of correcting it. The mathematical methods presented are likely to be useful in other geophysical problems that approximate a region of the Earth as being flat...|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} method for partitioning a charge density grid into Bader volumes is presented which is efficient, robust, and scales linearly {{with the number}} of grid points. The partitioning algorithm follows the steepest ascent paths along the charge density gradient from grid point to grid point until a charge density maximum is reached. In this paper, we describe how accurate off-lattice ascent paths can be represented with respect to the grid points. This improvement maintains the efficient linear scaling of an earlier version of the algorithm, and eliminates a tendency for the Bader surfaces to be aligned along the <b>grid</b> <b>directions.</b> As the algorithm assigns grid points to charge density maxima, subsequent paths are terminated when they reach previously assigned grid points. It is this grid-based approach which gives the algorithm its efficiency, and allows for the analysis of the large grids generated from plane-wave-based density functional theory calculations.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{algorithm}} and associated data model for creating a watershed boundary using a 2 D Flow <b>Direction</b> <b>Grid.</b> Flow <b>Direction</b> <b>Grids</b> (FDGs) are common abstractions for hydrodynamic models and are utilized for delineating physical systems (e. g. watersheds, fluvial, and non-fluvial flow paths). The proposed algorithm and associated data model provides geometric speed increases in watershed boundary retrieval while keeping storage constraints linear in comparison to existing techniques. The algorithm called Haag Shokoufandehs' March (HSM) relies on an existing data structure, the modified nested set model, originally described by Celko and applied to hydrodynamic models by Haag and Shokoufandeh in 2017. The proposed algorithm creates watershed boundaries by marching {{around the edges of}} its' corresponding region, never entering the internal area. In contrast to existing algorithms that scales in proportional to the area of the underlying region, the complexity of the HSM algorithm is proportional to the boundary length. Results for a group of tested watersheds (n = 14, 718) in the approximately 36, 000 km^ 2 Delaware River Watershed show a reduction of between 0 and 99 % in computational complexity using a 30 m DEM vs. existing techniques.

While many of these models propose specific mechanisms by which path integration might occur, predictions of these specific mechanisms have not been tested. Here I derive and test a key prediction of one attractor network path integration mechanism. Specifically, I first demonstrate that this mechanism predicts a periodic distribution of conjunctive cell preferred directions in order to minimize drift. Next, I test whether conjunctive cell preferred directions are in fact periodically organized. Results indicate that conjunctive cells are preferentially tuned to increments of 36 °, consistent with drift minimization in this path integration mechanism. By contrast, no periodicity was observed in the preferred directions of either pure grid or pure head direction cells.

40|$|Abstract. A hole-cutting {{technique}} for assembling overlapping grid systems for solving partial dierential equations is presented. In the present method, the closed surfaces on {{the boundary of}} the three-dimensional computational domain are represented by hybrid surface grids. The hybrid grids are composed of nonoverlapping structured surface grids joined by an unstructured layer of triangles. Each hybrid grid is constructed from {{a subset of the}} physical boundary points on the faces of the component grids. The holes in the component grids are made by using a two-step mark-and-ll method. We rst locate all grid cells that intersect the hybrid surface grids. We then apply the ray method to determine whether the grid points in these intersected grid cells are inside or outside the region bounded by the hybrid surface grids. As a result, the boundary of the hole region will be marked and it is a simple matter to then remove all points from the hole by starting from the outside points and traversing along all three <b>grid</b> <b>directions</b> until an inside point is found. To locate the intersecting grid cells, we employ the ray method augmented by an octree-based search technique together with Newton’s method to invert the mappings corresponding to each component grid.
