40|$|Abstract—Code <b>examples</b> {{are small}} source code {{fragments}} whose {{purpose is to}} illustrate how a programming language con-struct, an API, or a specific function/method works. Since code <b>examples</b> are not always available in the software documentation, researchers have proposed techniques to automatically extract them from existing software or to mine them from developer discussions. In this paper we propose MUSE (Method USage <b>Examples),</b> an approach for mining and ranking actual code <b>examples</b> that show {{how to use a}} specific method. MUSE combines static slicing (to simplify <b>examples)</b> with clone detection (to group similar <b>examples),</b> and uses heuristics to select and rank the best <b>examples</b> in terms of reusability, understandability, and popularity. MUSE has been empirically evaluated using <b>examples</b> mined from six libraries, by performing three studies involving a total of 140 developers to: (i) evaluate the selection and ranking heuristics, (ii) provide their perception on the usefulness of the selected <b>examples,</b> and (iii) perform specific programming tasks using the MUSE <b>examples.</b> The results indicate that MUSE selects and ranks <b>examples</b> close to how humans do, most of the code <b>examples</b> (82 %) are perceived as useful, and they actually help when performing programming tasks.

40|$|Instructional {{strategies}} for successfully teaching concepts are {{found throughout the}} instructional design literature. These strategies primarily consist of presenting learners with definitions, <b>examples,</b> and non-examples. While <b>examples</b> are important presentation instruments, theorist suggests that <b>examples</b> should not be re-used in the assessment phase of instruction. The rationale being that encountered <b>examples</b> could be memorized thus activating different cognitive processes than those required for concept attainment. Consequently, test items referring to encountered <b>examples</b> may have less value in assisting evaluators in discerning {{whether or not a}} learner has attained a target concept.

40|$|Background. How {{indispensable}} are <b>examples</b> {{and main}} ideas in study texts? In research into comprehension of expository texts <b>examples</b> are sometimes considered as cognitive support, sometimes as seductive details. According to the cognitivist view, text comprehension {{is based on}} main ideas, whereas the constructivist view holds that <b>examples</b> are the basis of understanding. Aims. This study explored how text comprehension is influenced by main ideas and <b>examples</b> in study texts, in relation to Vermunt's (1992, 1998) 'concrete elaboration' learning style. In Experiment 1, concrete texts with many <b>examples</b> were compared with abstract texts with many main ideas. In Experiment 2, idea-oriented texts, in which main ideas preceded <b>examples,</b> were compared with example-oriented texts, in which <b>examples</b> preceded main ideas. Samples. In both experiments, undergraduate social sciences students studied various versions of an introductory text on educational psychology. Methods. The text contained sections with a varying number of relevant and irrelevant <b>examples</b> and {{with or without a}} main idea (Experiment I), and sections with a main idea followed by <b>examples,</b> sections with a main idea without <b>examples,</b> or sections with <b>examples</b> followed by a main idea (Experiment 2). After studying the text, students completed a verbatim recognition test and an explanation test. Results. Best results were obtained after studying sections with a main idea and two or five <b>examples.</b> Irrelevant <b>examples</b> were detrimental to understanding. Students used <b>examples</b> to construct knowledge or to activate prior knowledge. Students with a strong habit of concrete elaboration used main ideas to recollect episodes of personal experience, This may interfere with understanding underlying concepts and principles by relating main ideas to <b>examples</b> in the text, Students with a low score on the concrete elaboration scale were sensitive to the presence of <b>examples</b> in the study text. Conclusion. In expository texts, <b>examples</b> are indispensable. The findings suggest that main ideas are useful, and, in order to prevent interference effects, the more so when they are put at the end of sections...|$|R
