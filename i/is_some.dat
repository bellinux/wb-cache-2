5|$|As an apex predator, Daspletosaurus {{was at the}} top of {{the food}} chain, {{probably}} preying on large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid Centrosaurus and the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus.

While Daspletosaurus fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids', the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of these animals, including social behavior, diet and life history.|$|E

Gorgosaurus is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from dozens of specimens.
