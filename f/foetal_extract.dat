40|$|Leucocytes from {{patients}} {{with a variety of}} tumours including gastric, colorectal, lung, kidney and mammary cancer, were tested in the leucocyte migration test (LMT) against organ-related and non-organ-related tumour and <b>foetal</b> <b>extracts.</b> The reactivity of cancer patients' leucocytes against a panel of organ-related tumour extracts was found to be 71 - 93 %, depending on the tumour system tested. Cross-reactivity with a panel on non-organ-related tumour extracts was found in 0 - 38 % of patients. Corresponding patterns of reactivity were obtained by testing patients' leucocytes against human foetal organ extracts; pathological migration indices (MI) were found in 70 % of tests in which patients' leucocytes were reacted with organ-related extracts, and in 16 % of tests with non-organ-related extracts. The data strongly support the concept that patients' leucocytes are sensitized to cross-reactive foetal determinants of organ-related specificities. Furthermore, it is proposed that <b>foetal</b> <b>extracts</b> as inducers of lymphokine production in presensitized lymphocytes could be used efficiently and reproducibly as a source of foetal antigen, {{as well as in the}} clinical application of the LMT procedure...|$|R
40|$|During {{the growth}} of the {{pregnant}} uterus of inbred Balb/c mice uterine colony-stimulating factor (CSF) content increased 800 -fold. This corresponded to a 75 -fold increase in CSF concentration. The size of the increase was the same in the uteri of inbred Balb/c mice and the uteri of F ± hybrid C 57 Bl/Balb/c mice mated with Ft males. It was about four times greater in these uteri {{than it was in the}} uteri of randomly mated TO mice. After unilateral Fallopian tubal ligation of TO mice the concentration of CSF was as great in the non-gravid uterine horns as it was in the gravid uterine horns. Physicochemical characterization of CSF from extracts of pregnant uterus showed that it differed from that found in <b>foetal</b> <b>extracts</b> and that found in the circulation.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} in idiopathic Addison's disease of circulating antibodies with specific reactivity to adrenocortical components indicates {{a state of}} organ-specific hypersensitivity of the humoral type. The typical histopathological picture in idiopathic Addison's disease suggests a co-existing cellular (delayed type) hypersensitivity with similar specificity. To test this possibility, the leucocyte migration test was applied {{in a series of}} patients with Addison's disease, using pooled, <b>foetal,</b> adrenal <b>extract</b> as antigen. The results indicate the existence in nine out of fifteen patients with idiopathic Addison's disease of a state of organ-specific, anti-adrenal hypersensitivity of the cellular type. This reactivity was not seen in patients with Addison's disease of unquestionably tuberculous origin. A parallel study showed that adrenal extract did not induce blast transformation in lymphocyte cultures, as estimated by examination of cell morphology and [14 C]thymidine incorporation...|$|R
40|$|Antisera to {{extracts}} of {{a variety}} of bronchogenic carcinoma were raised in rabbits and extensively absorbed with immunoadsorbents prepared with normal lung extracts cyanogen bromide linked to Sepharose 4 B, and glutaraldehyde insolubilized normal lung extracts.

40|$|A {{method for}} <b>extracting</b> <b>foetal</b> heart sounds (FHS) from noisy single channel {{abdominal}} phonograms is proposed. First, an appropriate matrix of delays is constructed; then multiple independent components are calculated using FastICA; finally, components are projected {{back onto the}} measurement space and those associated to FHS are subjectively selected. Three single channel phonograms, obtained from different subjects were analysed. Preliminary results are promising and showed successfully extractions of FHS (S 1, S 2).

40|$|Extracts of glioblastomas and meningiomas were {{analysed}} by quantitative immunoelectrophoresis for {{the presence}} of foetal brain antigens and tumour-associated antigens, and levels of 2 normal brain-specific proteins were also determined. The following antibodies were used: monospecific anti-S- 100 (glia specific); monospecific anti-GFA (glial fibrillary acidic protein), (astroglia specific); polyspecific anti-foetal brain (12 - 16 th week of gestation); a polyspecific anti-glioblastoma antiserum, absorbed with insolubilized serum, haemolysate and normal brain extract; polyspecific anti-alpha-foetoprotein; and monospecific anti-ferritin. Using the antibodies raised against the tumours, several antigens not present in foetal or adult normal brain were found in the glioblastomas and the meningiomas. These antigens cross-reacted with antigens present in normal liver and were therefore not tumour-associated. S- 100 was found in glioblastomas in approximately one tenth the amount in whole brain homogenate, whereas GFA was found 2 - 4 times enriched. The 2 proteins were absent in meningiomas. The possible use of the GFA protein as a marker for astroglial neoplasia is discussed. Five foetal antigens were found in foetal brain, but none in the tumours. alpha-Foetoprotein could only be demonstrated in <b>foetal</b> tissue <b>extracts,</b> including <b>foetal</b> brain, but not in tumours.

40|$|There is {{a certain}} degree of foetal-maternal {{transfusion}} in every pregnancy. The possibilities for using intact <b>foetal</b> cells <b>extracted</b> from maternal blood for prenatal diagnosis are limited. Recently real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques have allowed the identification and quantification of foetal DNA in the maternal blood. Foetal sex determination with Y-chromosome-PCR has been found to have a specificity of 100 %. The sensitivity is 96 % but increases with gestational age, so that from 10 weeks onwards the sensitivity approaches 100 %. In the case of X-linked diseases, this technique can reduce invasive prenatal diagnosis by 50 %. In the case of a foetus with an elevated risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, early non-invasive foetal sexing can also shorten the period of maternal dexamethasone use so as to prevent virilisation in the female foetus. Early second trimester non-invasive foetal RhD genotyping with an RhD-PCR has a sensitivity and specificity of 100 % each. Therefore in the future, anti-D immunoprophylaxis will be superfluous in RhD-negative women with an RhD-negative foetus. Theoretically all new and paternal inherited disorders with a known gene defect can be detected in maternal plasma. Some examples have already been described. Recently published small scale studies describe elevated concentrations of free foetal DNA in maternal plasma in (threatening) preterm labour, pre-eclampsia and aneuploidy. Large-scale studies are necessary to demonstrate the value of these finding...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Extraction of the foetal {{electrocardiogram}} from single-channel maternal abdominal signals {{without disturbing}} its morphology is difficult. We propose {{to solve the}} problem by application of projective filtering of time-aligned ECG beats. The method performs synchronization of the beats and then employs the rules of principal component analysis to the desired ECG reconstruction. In the first stage, the method is applied to the composite abdominal signals, containing maternal ECG, foetal ECG, and various types of noise. The operation leads to maternal ECG enhancement and to suppression of the other components. In the next stage, the enhanced maternal ECG is subtracted from the composite signal, and this way the <b>foetal</b> ECG is <b>extracted.</b> Finally, the extracted signal is also enhanced by application of projective filtering. The influence of the developed method parameters on its operation is presented. Key words: principal component analysis; projective filtering; foetal ECG. 1...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS The case {{described}} {{here is that}} of young primigravida in normal health who, on serological evidence, contracted acute brucellosis, and subsequently aborted spontaneously, Br. abortus biotype 2 being isolated from the amniotic fluid. Little is known of the part played by infection with Br. abortus {{as a cause of}} abortion in the human species. Several writers associate abortion with the presence of clinical and serological evidence of infection (Simpson and Fraizer, 1929; deCarle, 1931; del Vecchio, 1936; Williamson, 1944). Br. abortus has on occasion been isolated from <b>foetal</b> and placental <b>extract</b> after abortion (Carpenter and Boak, 1931). However, Huddleson (1943) states that there is no tendency to abortion in ordinary cases of brucellosis but where there is a prolonged high temperature, abortion is likely. Likewise Spink (1956) states that there is no definite evidence that brucellosis is more likely to result in abortion than infection with any other species of bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Microtubular subunit protein (tubulin) was {{isolated}} from <b>foetal</b> rabbit brain <b>extracts</b> by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex or by in vitro polymerisation procedures. The effects of indole alkaloids and related compounds on the colchicine and nucleotide binding properties of tubulin were investigated using sensitive radiochemical assay procedures developed for this purpose. It was shown that {{in contrast to}} the stabilising effects of Vinca alkaloids (vincristine and vinblastine), a number of structurally related drugs containing methoxyindole derivatives (e. g. reserpine, melatonin, harmine) inhibited the binding of colchicine to the protein. However, both groups of indole alkaloids markedly enhanced the binding of guanosine nucleotides to tubulin. During the course of this work, the specificity of nucleotide binding sites present in isolated microtubular protein preparations was also investigated. The effects of indole derivatives on the in vitro assembly of brain microtubules were studied by electron microscopy: various Vinca alkaloids as well as colchicine caused either partial or complete block of microtubule assembly, while melatonin promoted the appearance of 'twisted' microtubules. However, the reassembly of microtubules in the presence of reserpine appeared to be normal. Additional experiments are reported concerning the binding of [3 H] vincristine to isolated tubulin and the subcellular distribution of vincristine binding receptors in brain homogenates. A short collaborative study on the phosphorylation of microtubular proteins in vitro and in situ is also reported. <p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Foetal {{electrocardiogram}} (FECG) was {{the best}} method used to diagnose Foetal heart problem. Knowledge of the foetal heart signal prevents Foetal problems in the earlier stage. Recently, {{there has been a}} growing interest in noninvasive method rather than the old invasive method which was more risky for the mother’s health. The most significant problem in noninvasive method is the extraction of the Foetal signals from maternal signals and many contaminated noises. The problems of extraction of the Foetal signals are the problems that plagued researchers in the field of signal processing. Objective to develop a technique for extracting FECG signals based on adaptive filter and simple Genetic algorithm. Approach: Practical method for extraction using computer simulations was proposed. The proposed method detects Foetal ECG by denoising abdominal ECG (AECG) and lead to the subsequent cancellation of maternal ECG (MECG) by adaptive filtering. The thoracic signal (TECG) which is purely of Mother signal (MECG) was used to cancel MECG in abdominal signal and the <b>Foetal</b> ECG detector <b>extracts</b> the FECG through Simple Genetic algorithm which enters as the editor of unwanted noise. Results: The FECG signal which was obtained appears to agree with the standard Foetal ECG signals. A program for carrying out the calculations was developed in matlab. The testing of the algorithms was done by using real data from SISTA/DAISY and Physionet. Conclusion: The proposed technique for extraction of FECG was useful and the results appear to agree with the mean values of FECG.

40|$|Inductively coupled plasma mass {{spectrometry}} (ICP-MS), a comparatively new multi-element analytical technique was employed for elemental determination in human hair, placenta and brain samples. The performance criteria of ICP-MS such as precision, accuracy and detection limits were assessed. For most elements sub ng ml- 1 limits of detection were achieved. Amino acid analysis of human <b>foetal</b> brain <b>extracts</b> was performed using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Prior to separation, samples were derivatised using o-phthaldialdehyde derivatising reagent. Precision {{and limits of}} detection were assessed. For most amino acids detection limits of sub nmoles ml- 1 were achieved. Hair is commonly used as a diagnostic and monitoring tool to observe the effects of mineral supplementation on an individuals bodily status, especially prior and after pregnancy. Some of the factors influencing the elemental content of hair were investigated. Analysing scalp hair of thirteen female individuals showed that longitudinal variations exist in elemental composition of human scalp hair. Radial and longitudinal diffusion of Co, Zn and Cd were investigated in scalp hair, using tresses of "virgin" hair. Both radial and longitudinal diffusions occurred for all three elements. Analysis of scalp hair of thirty-seven females and twenty male subjects from United Kingdom showed that {{there were significant differences}} in concentrations of Mg, K, Ca, Mn and Fe between males and females. Effects of six months mineral supplementation (18. 6 mg Mg, 31. 0 mg Ca, 1. 2 mg Cr, 4. 0 mg Mn and 7. 5 mg Zn daily) on elemental content of hair was investigated in six female subjects and no significant changes were observed in the levels of supplemented elements (Mg, Ca, Cr, Mn and Zn). For elemental analysis of placenta, the importance of defining the location of the sampling site was demonstrated by investigating levels of Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn and Pb in different regions of a placental disc. Significant variations were found in the elemental content of the various regions. The peripheral region of the placental discs from fifty black females from Soweto, South Africa, were analysed for their elemental content in relation to birthweight and gestational age of their neonates. Concentrations of Mg, Al, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sr, Mo, Cd and Pb were determined. Positive correlation was found for Mg, K, Fe, Cu and As with both medical parameters and Zn with gestational age. Lower concentrations of Mg (P < 0. 10), Cu (P < 0. 05), Zn (P < 0. 10) and As (P < 0. 001) were found in low birthweight cases compared to high birthweight groups. Comparison with an English population showed that significant differences existed in the placental elemental levels of the two communities. The contributing factors are fully discussed. Analysis of Mg, P, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Mo and Pb in foetal brain tissues of eleven stillbirths and ten socially terminated neonates showed that stillbirth brains contained significantly (P < 0. 001) higher levels of Pb compared to the controls. Analysis of four different regions of the brains; hippocampus, cerebrum, cerebellum and basal ganglia, also showed higher concentrations of Pb in all the four regions in comparison with the controls. Most elements showed significant differences in their regional concentrations within each study group and the patterns were different in stillbirths compared to the social terminations. However, concentration of Zn was predominantly higher in hippocampus compared to the other regions, in both study groups. The concentrations of fifteen amino acids were measured in the same foetal brain samples used for elemental analysis. Stillbirth brain tissues had lower levels of alanine (P < 0. 05), phenylalanine (P < 0. 05) and Isoleucine (P < 0. 05) compared to social terminations. Regional brain analysis of amino acids revealed higher concentrations of glutamic acid, aspartic acid and serine in the hippocampal region. The significance of these results and any relationship found between the amino acid and elemental content of the analysed foetal brain samples are discussed in detail. Overall this work demonstrates and supports the importance of an adequate balance of elements and amino acids for a successful outcome of pregnancy...|$|R
