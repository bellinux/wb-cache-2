25|$|In a mixed {{review of}} the book in the Wall Street Journal, William Easterly was {{generally}} supportive of the plausibility of the book's thesis but critiqued the book's failure to cite extant statistics-based {{evidence to support the}} validity of the historical case studies. For example, in the book's example about Congo, the stated reason Congo is impoverished is that Congo is close to slave trade shipping points. The approach of this historical case study only offers one data point. Moreover, Easterly also points out the danger of ex-post rationalization that the book only attributes <b>different</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> to institutions in a way a bit too neat. For example, to explain the fall of Venice, it could be the extractive regime during the time or it could also be the shift from Mediterranean trade to Atlantic trade. The historical case studies approach might be biased.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{problems}} of evaluation of institutional system’s develop-ment in transition economies and studying the impact it has on economic performance. The au-thors developed and used a methodology of estimating an operational indicator of institutional system dynamics for observing the “institutional reforms-economic growth ” interdependence in transition economies. The observations revealed certain dependence between institutional deve-lopment and growth. In the remaining part of the paper the problems of international economic integration of transition economies were discussed in context of EU accession. The case of Mexico is used as a benchmark for successful integration <b>of</b> economies with <b>different</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>development...</b>|$|R
