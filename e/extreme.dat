40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that anthropogenic-induced climate change {{may affect the}} frequency and intensity of hydrological <b>extremes,</b> together {{with a variety of}} subsequent impacts on ecosystems and human society. Proxy records that are absolutely dated and annually resolved are indispensable {{to a better understanding of}} temporal changes in the occurrence of floods and droughts. This contribution presents a new data set of 3194 oak (Quercus spp.) ring width samples from living trees and historical timbers, collected across the Czech Republic. A composite tree-ring width (TRW) chronology is developed that best captures the high-frequency <b>extremes</b> over the past 1250 years. The temporal distribution of negative and positive <b>extremes</b> is regular with no indication of clustering. The highest number of negative <b>extremes</b> was found in the 19 th century, while positive <b>extremes</b> were most frequent in the 12 th century. The lowest number of negative and positive <b>extremes</b> occurred in the 18 th and 13 th centuries respectively. Negative and positive TRW <b>extremes</b> were compared with the instrumental measurements back to 1805 AD, with documentary-based temperature and precipitation reconstructions from 1804 to 1500, and with documentary evidence before 1500 AD. Negative TRW <b>extremes</b> coincided with above-average March–May and June–August temperature means and below-average precipitation totals. Positive <b>extremes</b> coincided with higher summer precipitation, while temperatures were mostly normal. Mean sea level pressure (SLP) over the European/North Atlantic sector suggested drought for the negative oak TRW <b>extremes,</b> whereas the positive <b>extremes</b> corresponded to wetter conditions overall. More consistent patterns of synoptic SLP were found for negative rather than for positive <b>extremes.</b> Reasons for the possible offset between the oak-based hydroclimatic <b>extremes</b> and their counterparts from meteorological observations and documentary evidence may be manifold and emphasize the need for multi-proxy approaches...|$|R

40|$|Weather {{and climate}} <b>extremes</b> exert devastating {{influence}} on human society and ecosystem around the world. Recent observations show increase in frequency {{and intensity of}} climate <b>extremes</b> around the world including East Asia. In order to assess current status of the observed changes in weather and climate <b>extremes</b> and discuss possible mechanisms, this study {{provides an overview of}} recent analyses on such <b>extremes</b> over Korea and East Asia. It is found that the temperature <b>extremes</b> over the Korean Peninsula exhibit long-term warming trends with more frequent hot events and less frequent cold events, along with sizeable interannual and decadal variabilities. The comprehensive review on the previous literature further suggests that the weather and climate <b>extremes</b> over East Asia can be affected by several climate factors of external and internal origins. It has been assessed that greenhouse warming leads to increase in warm <b>extremes</b> and decrease in cold <b>extremes</b> over East Asia, but recent Arctic sea-ice melting and associated warming tends to bring cold snaps to East Asia during winter. Internal climate variability such as tropical intraseasonal oscillation and El Nio-Southern Oscillation can also exert considerable impacts on weather and climate <b>extremes</b> over Korea and East Asia. It is, however, noted that our current understanding is far behind to estimate the effect of these climate factors on local weather and climate <b>extremes</b> in a quantitative senseclose 2...|$|R
40|$|This study expands {{previous}} work on climate <b>extremes</b> in Australia by investigating the simulation {{of a large}} number of <b>extremes</b> indices in the CMIP 5 multi-model dataset and comparing them to multiple observational datasets over a century of observed data using consistent methods. We calculate 24 indices representing <b>extremes</b> of temperature and precipitation from 1911 to 2010 over Australia and show that there have been significant observed trends in temperature <b>extremes</b> associated with warming while there have been few significant observed trends in precipitation <b>extremes.</b> We compare the observed indices calculated from two mostly independent datasets with 22 CMIP 5 models to determine how well global climate models are able to simulate observed climatologies, variability and trends. We find that generally temperature <b>extremes</b> are reasonably well simulated (climatology, variability and trend patterns) although the models tend to overestimate minimum temperature <b>extremes</b> and underestimate maximum temperature <b>extremes.</b> Some models stand out as being outliers and we exclude one model (INMCM 4) entirely from the multi-model analysis as it simulates unrealistic minimum temperature <b>extremes</b> over the historical period. There is more spread between models for precipitation than temperature <b>extremes</b> but in most cases the observations sit within the model spread. Exceptions are consecutive wet days (CWD) where nearly all models overestimate the actual number of annual wet days and simple daily intensity (SDII) and one day precipitation maxima (Rx 1 day) where the models tend to underestimate precipitation intensity. However, some of these differences likely lie in observational uncertainty. Most models including the multi-model mean indicate that precipitation intensity has increased over the last century but the two observational datasets analysed disagree on the sign of change of precipitation intensity, one of them indicating a significant decrease. We use the CMIP 5 simulations for two future Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5) to project changes in temperature and precipitation <b>extremes</b> across Australia. By the end of the century the number of cold temperature <b>extremes</b> substantially reduces and the number of warm temperature <b>extremes</b> substantially increases; changes scaling relative to the strength of emissions scenario. Changes in temperature <b>extremes</b> are often greatest in the tropics. While the results for precipitation <b>extremes</b> are less marked, simulations for the end of the century compared to present day indicate more periods of dryness while the most intense precipitation <b>extremes</b> increase substantially, with a separation becoming clear between emissions scenarios...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} a composite circulation index of weather <b>extremes</b> (CIE). The new index informs about the synoptic conditions favoring the occurrence of <b>extremes</b> on a regional scale. It was evaluated for temperature and precipitation <b>extremes</b> for Poland. Daily homogenized data obtained from 14 weather stations, which cover most of the country, were used. The data used cover the 60 -year period from 1951 to 2010. The index is based on relationships between <b>extremes</b> and mesoscale circulation conditions. The core material also included data describing circulation types for the study period. Three different calendars were used (Grosswetterlagen, by Lity?ski, by Nied?wied?). The conditional probability of the occurrence of <b>extremes</b> for particular types was calculated independently using partial indices (Partial Index of weather <b>Extremes</b> ? PIE). The higher the index values, the more favorable the synoptic situation for the occurrence of <b>extremes.</b> The results were grouped by describing the probability of temperature and precipitation <b>extremes</b> on the IPCC likelihood scale. Three thresholds corresponding to the frequency of an occurrence were identified via a seasonal approach. The CIE was validated using basic correlation coefficients as well as contingency tables based on feature-displacement criteria and Bayesian Probability Methods. The results confirmed the significance of atmospheric circulation in the formation of temperature and precipitation <b>extremes</b> in Poland.

40|$|Recent special {{reports on}} climate <b>extremes</b> have shown evidences {{of changes in}} the {{patterns}} of climate <b>extremes</b> at global, regional and local scales. Understanding the characteristics of climate <b>extremes</b> at regional and local levels is critical not only for the development of preparedness and early warning systems, but is also fundamental in the development of any adaptation strategies. There is still very limited knowledge regarding the past, present and future patterns of climate <b>extremes</b> in the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA). This study, which was supported by the World Bank Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (WB-GFDRR) and implemented by the World Meteorological Organization, was organized in terms of three workshops with three main objectives; (1) analysis of daily rainfall and temperature <b>extremes</b> for ten countries in the GHA region using observed in situ data running from 1971 to 2006, (2) assessing whether the United Kingdom Met-office and Hadley centre Providing REgional Climates for Impact Studies (UK-PRECIS) modelling system can provide realistic representation of the past and present climate <b>extremes</b> as observed by available in situ data, and (3) studying the future regional climate <b>extremes</b> under different scenarios to further assess the expected changes in climate <b>extremes.</b> This paper, therefore, uses the outputs of these workshops and also includes post-workshop analyses to assess the changes of climate <b>extremes</b> within the GHA. The results showed a significant decrease in total precipitation in wet days greater than 1 [*]mm and increasing warm <b>extremes,</b> particularly at night, while cold <b>extremes</b> are decreasing.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{impact of}} climate change on frequency and severity of weather <b>extremes</b> is hotly debated among climate scientists. Weather <b>extremes</b> can {{have a significant impact}} on agricultural production, but their effect is often unclear; this due to interaction with other factors that affect yield and due to lack of precise definitions of relevant weather <b>extremes.</b> We show that an empirical analysis of historical yields can help to identifying such rare, high impact climate events. A reconstructed time series of ware potato production in Flevoland (The Netherlands) over the last 60 years (1951 – 2010) enabled us to identify the two main yield affecting weather <b>extremes.</b> In around 10 % of the years yield anomalies were larger than - 20 %. We found that these anomalies could be explained from two weather <b>extremes</b> (and no other), namely a wet start of the growing season and wet end of the growing season. We derived quantitative, meteorological definitions of these <b>extremes.</b> Climate change scenarios for 2050 show either no change or increased frequency of the two <b>extremes.</b> We demonstrate there is large uncertainty about past and future frequencies of the <b>extremes,</b> caused by a lack of sufficiently long historical weather records and uncertainties in climate change projections on precipitation.
