Using the velocity map imaging technique in combination with the slice imaging technique, the spatial recoil distribution of the photofragments can be measured with high resolution and without symmetry restrictions. Insertion of orientation electrodes between the repeller and the extractor of a velocity mapping electrostatic lens severely distorts the ion trajectories. The position where the ions are focused by the lens, the focal length, can be very different in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the inserted orientation electrodes.

30|$|The lack {{of closed}} {{two-level}} systems that makes laser cooling {{so hard for}} molecules is also responsible for the difficulties in molecular detection using absorption or laser-induced fluorescence. Moreover, {{in the presence of}} a physical structure such as a microchip, scattering or laser-induced fluorescence from surfaces adds noise to images, something which is critical when working with small samples. For these reasons, on-chip detection has only recently been demonstrated [48]. On-chip detection is based on resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) [56], which is quantum state selective, is intrinsically background-free, and is of general applicability. REMPI is obtained on the chip by illuminating the molecules with a sheet of light parallel to the surface of the chip. It is worth noting that ions are several orders of magnitude more sensitive to electric fields than polar molecules. However, if care is taken to carefully zero all electric fields used to manipulate the neutral molecules before the ions are created, it is possible to create a spatial image of the molecules in a microchannel-plates detector.

These signals should reduce the number of added elements necessary to correct for matrix interferences;Ions are extracted from the ICP through a conventional sampler and skimmer and then deposited on an array of graphite targets at the exit of a set of electrostatic ion lenses. Scandium ion signal is enhanced by choosing appropriate potentials on the ion lenses. The Sc[superscript]+ ion signal is suppressed by the presence of concomitant Cs ions at high concentrations. Comparisons of grounded ion lenses and two different <b>ion</b> <b>lens</b> potential settings were made. The signal is enhanced more extensively by the ion lenses when there are no concentrated concomitant ions.

Furthermore, the NMR relaxation behavior of these <b>ions</b> in <b>lens</b> homogenates was consistent either with a model that assumed the occurrence of two predominant ionic populations, "free" and "bound," in fast exchange with each other or with a model that assumed an asymmetric Gaussian distribution of correlation times. Regardless of the model employed, both ions were found to occur in a predominantly "free" or "unbound" rapidly reorienting state. The fraction of "bound" 23 Na+, assuming a discrete two-site model, was approximately 0. 006 and 0. 017 for cortical and nuclear homogenates, respectively. Corresponding values for 39 K+ were 0. 003 and 0. 007, respectively. Estimated values for the fraction of "bound" 23 Na+ or 39 K+ obtained from the distribution model (tau C greater than omega L- 1) were {{less than or equal}} to 0. 05 for all cases examined. The correlation times of the "bound" ions, derived using either a two-site or distribution model, yielded values that were at least one order of magnitude smaller than the reorientational motion of the constituent lens proteins. This observation implies that the apparent correlation time for ion binding is dominated by processes other than protein reorientational motion, most likely fast exchange between "free" and "bound" environments. The results of NMR visibility studies were consistent with the above findings, in agreement with other studies performed by non-NMR methods.

The <b>ion</b> <b>lens</b> deflects ions off center {{and then back}} on center into the differential pumping orifice; there is no photon stop {{in the center of}} the beam. Calculations of ion trajectories with SIMION show that only those ions that leave the skimmer on center are transmitted, whereas most other lenses used in ICP-MS transmit only ions that leave the skimmer off axis. The performance of a Channeltron electron multiplier is compared to that of a Daly detector. Both detectors yield similar sensitivities of 10 [superscript] 6 counts s[superscript]- 1 per ppm and detection limits of 1 pptr. The background with a Channeltron electron multiplier is only 0. 4 counts s[superscript]- 1 and is only slightly higher than the dark current count rate. The background with the Daly detector is 4 counts s[superscript]- 1, which represents a substantial improvement over the background obtained in previous use of the Daly detector with ICP-MS;This new ICP-MS yields very low levels of many troublesome polyatomic ions such as ArO[superscript]+, ArN[superscript]+, Ar[subscript] 2 [superscript]+, ClO[superscript]+, and ArCl[superscript]+.

The voltage for the <b>ion</b> <b>lens</b> was set at 6  V. The gas flow rate in the spray chamber was 0.88  L min− 1. The power output for the RF generator was 1100  W. The auxiliary gas flow rate was 1.2  L min− 1. The nebulizer gas flow rate of the plasma was 16  L min− 1. The certified reference materials for calibration used were GBW 3041 (Ti), GBW(E) 080216 (V), GBW(E) 080257 (Cr), GBW(E) 080157 (Mn), GBW 08616 (Fe), GBW 08618 (Ni), GBW 08620 (Zn), GBW(E) 080243 (Ba), as well as GSB- 04 - 1750 - 2004 (Sc) and GSB- 04 - 1789 - 2004 (for rare earth elements except Sc). All the certified reference materials (in solution) were purchased from the National Institute of Metrology (Beijing, China). Blank control (n =  3) were {{carried out in the}} same way. GBW 10052 Tea Certified Reference Material was used to validate the accuracy of the method. All the procedures were performed in triplicate.|$|E
40|$|Inductively coupled plasma mass {{spectrometry}} {{of environmental and}} biological samples is often hampered by spectral and non-spectral interferences. Spectral interferences, caused by the limited resolution of the quadrupole mass spectrometer, can be eliminated {{in a variety of}} ways. For their identification inspection of a signal versus carrier gas flowrate is useful. Anion exchange allows the removal of most S and Cl containing compounds, which are at the origin of the majority of spectral interferences. Matrix modification, for example the addition of ethanol and subsequent optimization of the gas flow rates in a number of cases enables the reduction of the interferences to insignificant values. Often a mathematical correction based on isotopic signal ratios can be applied. Non-spectral interferences can be divided in reversible, that is occurring while the sample is being measured, and irreversible matrix effects, that is clogging of the nebulizer and sampling orifices or deposition on the torch or in the <b>ion</b> <b>lens</b> stack. The errors associated with non-spectral interferences can be eliminated by appropriate calibration procedures, adapted sample preparation or limitation of the amount of sample delivered to nebulizer, plasma and sampling devices, for example by the application of flow injection. Applications of all the elimination procedures are described for the analysis of sea-water, estuarine water, soil and sewage extracts, percolate water, urine, serum and wine...|$|E
40|$|The {{processes}} of ion exchange in crystals of semiconducting compounds of A 321 B 361 type and in crystals of ferroelectrics - niobate and lithium tantalate - were investigated {{with the aim}} of the development of both physical and technological principles of ion exchange in crystals to be further applied for integral optoelectronics and in the studies of fundamental properties of materials. As a result a physical model of ion exchange in monocrystals was built up. The rules and pecularities of ion exchange processes in crystals of the A 321 B 361 type and in crystals of niobate and lithium tantalate were studied. A number of new ion exchange processes were suggested. The thermodynamic and diffusion-kinetic parameters of compounds of the A 321 B 361 type and their hard solutions were determined. The production methods of wave-guide and photosensitive layers in crystals of the A 321 B 361 type and in crystals of niobate and lithium tantalate were developed.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this project {{is the development of}} the SIMS associated to a new probe of the solid: massive clusters consisting of 100 – 1000 bismuth or gold atoms. The systematic study of the ionic emission intensities {{as a function of the}} mass and energy of these projectiles showed that 100 – 200 qkeV is sufficient energy for the new probe. It is possible to obtain a time of flight (ToF) spectrum with a single impact. These spectra permit to characterize light molecules (MW∼ a few hundreds) with their fragments and intact molecular ion peaks. To analyze the surface, we propose to obtain cluster beams of 100 – 150 qkeV with a diameter of 10 – 100 µm, and to associate measurements of time of flight mass spectrometry with the detection of electron emission in order to locate the impact on the surface. We describe the simulation and the installation, on a 130 kV platform, of our column including a LMIS (Liquid Metal <b>ion</b> Source), <b>lenses</b> and Wien Filter, and of a focusing beam line made of an accelerating gap with its shield and a 130 kV insulator.

40|$|Concepts in {{instrument}} {{development in}} academia are enunciated {{and applied to}} two projects: (i) the miniaturization of an ion trap and (ii) construction of a QogoQ instrument {{for the study of}} ion/surface collisions. ^ In the first project, a miniature (5 mm internal radius) cylindrical ion trap (CIT) was developed and systematic studies of geometric effects have been performed to optimize the instrument. Two CITs were arranged in series to construct a serial array which was operated using a single ion source, detector and rf trapping signal. Ions trapped in the first CIT were later transferred to the second by applying ejecting and retarding do pulses to the endcap electrodes of the CITs. The transfer efficiency is dependent on the amplitude of the do potential applied to eject the ions from the first trap, the amplitude of the do potential applied to retain the ions in the second trap, and the period during which the retarding potential is applied. High-throughput mass spectrometers with multiple-channel ionization source, mass analyzer and detector have also been designed. ^ In the second project, a compact tandem mass spectrometer containing two quadrupole mass analyzers (Q, two octapole ion guides (o) and a static quadrupole <b>ion</b> beam-bending <b>lens</b> (q) (QogoQ configuration) has been built for the study of ion/surface collisions. Positive or negative ions are generated by either electron impact (EI) ionization or chemical ionization (CI), selected by mass-to-charge ratio, and then focused onto a surface at an angle of 45 °. The secondary ions generated from collisions with the target surface are collected at an emergent angle of 45 ° and then mass-analyzed. The capabilities of the QogoQ instrument are demonstrated by experiments on surface-induced dissociation (SID), charge permutation, surface analysis via chemical sputtering, and selective surface modification via ion/surface reactions. ...|$|R
