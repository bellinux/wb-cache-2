40|$|In recent years, many {{governments have}} tended to take a {{rational}} and development-oriented approach to planning, designing and managing city spaces. Some sociologists, however, have started to criticize this approach, and have begun to advocate instead the importance of taking into consideration the everyday lives of ordinary people. These sociologists offer us a new perspective for examining how “city users ” are tactically living in their cities. This perspective may not be accepted by all, and may have {{quite a lot of}} practical limitations; nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>offers</b> today’s designers as well as policymakers and other professionals some reflections and inspirations for further exploration and discussion. Through a theoretical review of how theorists and sociologists see city space and its order from different perspectives, and through empirical longitudinal studies done on three Hong Kong market streets, this article attempts to ascertain whether the inhabitants of a city—city users—are “tactical practitioners. ” The article then explores the role of city users and their interactions with the spaces in which they are living, and offers advice to designers who aim for more people-environment fit designs...|$|E
30|$|As {{a result}} of {{successful}} response to treatment, rectal tumors typically decrease in size while undergoing a fibrotic transformation. Untreated (non-mucinous) tumors show intermediate signal intensity on T 2 -weighted MRI that is {{lower than that of}} fat tissue, but higher than that of the normal muscular layer of the bowel wall. When tumor tissue becomes fibrotic, the signal drops considerably and the tumor bed becomes markedly hypointense. A small minority of tumors develop a mucinous response as {{a result of}} CRT, leading to an increase in signal after CRT [11]. At histopathology, these ‘mucin’ lakes typically contain no or rare isolated tumor cells [12]. A mucinous transformation in primarily non-mucinous tumors should therefore be considered a good prognostic sign. This {{should not be confused with}} primarily mucinous tumors that have an overall poorer prognosis and tend to show a poor response to CRT (see separate section on ‘Mucinous and signet-ring subtype’ below). Reductions in tumor volume in the range of 60 – 80 % have been reported in literature to correlate with a good response to treatment [13]. Although in oncology Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is often used as a unidimensional size measurement system to assess response, RECIST is not commonly used in rectal cancer, because it can be difficult to reproducibly measure irregularly shaped rectal tumors in one plane. 3 D whole volume tumor measurements have been reported to be better reproducible and more accurate to assess response [13], but these measurements can be very time consuming. As a practical alternative, the recent ESGAR guidelines therefore suggest to measure the tumor length before and after CRT, as reported measurement reproducibility for this metric is good and <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>offers</b> some estimation of the change in tumor size/volume as a result of treatment [2].|$|E
25|$|In 1910, the {{decision}} was made to do a second Court of Inquiry. The reasons for this were the recovery of the bodies of the victims, so they could be buried in the United States and also a desire for a more thorough investigation. The fact that the Cuban government wanted the wreck removed from Havana Harbor might also have played a role: <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>offered</b> the opportunity to examine the wreck in greater detail than had been possible in 1898, while simultaneously obliging the Cubans. Wegner suggests that the fact that this inquiry could be held without the pending risk of war, which had been the case in 1898, lent it the potential for greater objectivity than had been possible previously. Moreover, since several of the members of the 1910 board would be certified engineers, they would be better qualified to evaluate their findings than the line officers of the 1898 board had been.|$|R

40|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} is {{a common}} problem {{in the intensive care}} unit because it can increase rates of delirium, impede proper recovery, lead to longer hospital stays, and increase health care costs. This study aims to review three randomized controlled trials that observe the effect of noise reduction methods in improving sleep quality among intensive care patients. One study compared rates of delirium among those use earplugs and those who do not. Two other studies found that interventions such as earplugs, eye masks, and melatonin have proven to improve sleep quality. While interventions such as earplugs may be uncomfortable for some patients, it is reasonable <b>it</b> to <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>offer</b> these products to those who may want it. This can in turn improve patient satisfaction rates, decrease hospital length of stays and reduce healthcare costs. Moreover, these interventions are safe, cost effective, and easy to implement.
