The country is located in Central and West Africa on the Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. Cameroon lies between latitudes 1° and 13°N, and longitudes 8° and 17°E.|$|E
5|$|Deposits in the United States {{constitute}} 62% {{of world}} resources; together, the United States, Russia and Brazil account for 86% of the world's resources {{in terms of}} shale-oil content. These figures remain tentative, with exploration or analysis of several deposits still outstanding. Professor Alan R. Carroll of University of Wisconsin–Madison regards the Upper Permian lacustrine oil-shale deposits of northwest China, absent from previous global oil shale assessments, as comparable <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>to</b> the Green River Formation.|$|E

5|$|FRELIMO attack {{groups had}} {{also begun to}} grow <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>to</b> include over 100 {{soldiers}} in certain cases, and the insurgents also began to accept women fighters into their ranks.

5|$|For the 1999–2000 {{season the}} league {{increased}} <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>to</b> 22 clubs when two clubs were promoted into the Alliance but none relegated out of it. One of the promoted clubs was Oadby Town of the Leicestershire Senior League, {{the first time}} a team from that league had been promoted into the Alliance. Two years later, the league increased <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>to</b> 23 clubs as more teams joined than left, but Stapenhill resigned midway through the 2001–02 season, reverting the number of clubs in the competition back to 22. The league expanded to 24 clubs for the 2003–04 season, at the end of which, for the first time, Alliance clubs were promoted to the Northern Premier League, rather than the Southern League, when Rocester and Willenhall Town joined the more northerly of the two leagues. The following season Coalville Town became the first Alliance team to reach the first round proper of the FA Cup, a feat which was repeated in the 2005–06 season by both Chasetown and Leamington.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{per cent}} of Greater London {{is covered by}} the London post town, within which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses. The London {{telephone}} area code (020) covers a larger area, similar <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>to</b> Greater London, although some outer districts are excluded and some places just outside are included. The Greater London boundary has been aligned to the M25 motorway in places.|$|E

Yttrium is so close <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>to</b> the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves {{as if it were}} one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the lanthanide contraction.|$|E
5|$|K–Pg {{boundary}} mammalian {{species were}} generally small, comparable <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>to</b> rats; this small size {{would have helped}} them find shelter in protected environments. In addition, it is postulated that some early monotremes, marsupials, and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing, as there are multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today. Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from K–Pg boundary environmental stresses.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September, Eisenhower ordered both SHAEF Forward and SHAEF Main {{to move to}} Versailles as soon as possible. SHAEF Forward {{began its}} move on 15 September and it opened in Versailles on 20 September. SHAEF Main followed, moving from Bushy Park by air. This move was {{completed}} by October, and SHAEF remained there until 17 February 1945, when SHAEF Forward moved to Reims. By this time, SHAEF had grown <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>to</b> 16,000 officers and enlisted men, of whom 10,000 were American and 6,000 British.|$|E

5|$|On July 19, 2009, {{an impact}} site was {{discovered}} at approximately 216 degrees longitude in System 2. This impact {{left behind a}} black spot in Jupiter's atmosphere, similar <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>to</b> Oval BA. Infrared observation showed a bright spot where the impact took place, meaning the impact warmed up the lower atmosphere in the area near Jupiter's south pole.|$|E
5|$|Other {{countries}} {{have taken a}} lead in designating protected areas in South America. In 2004, Peru created {{one of the largest}} conservation areas in the world, Alto Purús National Park, with an area similar <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>to</b> Belgium. The park harbors many endangered plants and animals, including the giant otter, and holds the world record for mammal diversity. Bolivia designated wetlands larger than the size of Switzerland as a freshwater protected area in 2001; these are also home to the giant otter.|$|E
5|$|Pterodroma petrel remains dated {{at between}} 60,000 and 25,000 years BP {{were found in}} two cave sites in Gibraltar. They consist of a more {{abundant}} form similar <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>to</b> Zino's, and a larger, less common type. It is uncertain whether they represent {{the site of a}} former breeding colony, or are the result of a seabird wreck in which storms blow birds inland. They do suggest, however, that members of the genus were formerly more widespread.|$|E

5|$|Strepsirrhines {{have a long}} snout {{that ends}} in a moist and touch-sensitive rhinarium, {{similar to that of}} dogs and many other mammals. The rhinarium is {{surrounded}} by vibrissae that are also sensitive to touch. Convoluted maxilloturbinals on the inside of their nose filter, warm, and moisten the incoming air, while olfactory receptors of the main olfactory system lining the ethmoturbinals detect airborne smells. The olfactory bulbs of lemurs are comparable <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>to</b> those of other arboreal mammals.|$|E
5|$|The NHL doubled <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>to</b> 12 {{teams in}} 1967–68 and {{organized}} itself into two divisions: the East Division, {{with the original}} six teams, and the West Division, which contained the six expansion franchises. The playoff format was constructed so that an established team would face an expansion team in the Stanley Cup Finals. The Canadiens recovered from their loss in 1967 to sweep the St. Louis Blues four games to none in both 1968 and 1969 for their 15th and 16th championships.|$|E
