5|$|The scene then {{changes to}} Chuck and Sarah's wedding, {{after which they}} receive a wedding present from Hartley. Two weeks later, Chuck returns from his honeymoon to a deserted Castle, where he learns from Decker {{that he has been}} {{manipulated}} his entire spy career, leading to him receiving the Intersect and facing Fulcrum, the Ring, Daniel Shaw, and Volkoff. It is then revealed that Hartley's gift was all of Volkoff Industries' assets, giving Chuck and Sarah almost a billion dollars. Chuck purchases the Buy More from the government's front company, and he, Sarah, Casey, and Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) set up their own freelance spy operation in Castle to investigate the conspiracy involving Chuck. Morgan then spots a pair of <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> a box of Chuck's belongings sent from Beckman. Morgan puts them on and accidentally uploads an Intersect.|$|E
5|$|The old man kills Dr. Yonechi (Hiro Kanagawa), a Japanese researcher, by {{pricking}} {{him with}} a metallic stylus, introducing an unknown chemical into his body. The agents approach Nichols' girlfriend and colleague, Lisa Ianelli (Susan Lee Hoffman), who recognizes the chemical compound as a rapid freezing agent that Jason had been engineering for years. However, she claims that the compound {{has not yet been}} invented and that if Yonechi was injected with the chemical, he may not be dead. With Lisa's help, Scully and a team of medical personnel successfully resuscitate Yonechi, only for his body temperature to rapidly increase until he bursts into flames. Police receive a tip that the old man is living at a nearby hotel. Inside the old man's room, the agents discover a faded color photograph picturing Jason, Yonechi and Lisa toasting champagne <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> the cryology lab. Mulder realizes from the picture that the old man is a time traveller who is attempting to alter that future, and that he is none other than Jason Nichols.|$|E

25|$|In typical natural {{conditions}} normalized corrosion rates of silicate glasses are very low and {{are of the}} order of 10−7–10−5 g/(cm2·d). The very high durability of silicate <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> water makes them suitable for hazardous and nuclear waste immobilisation.|$|E

25|$|Glass {{disease is}} the {{corrosion}} of silicate <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> aqueous solutions. It {{is governed by}} two mechanisms: diffusion-controlled leaching (ion exchange) and hydrolytic dissolution of the glass network. Both mechanisms strongly depend on the pH of contacting solution: the rate of ion exchange decreases with pH as 10−0.5pH whereas the rate of hydrolytic dissolution increases with pH as 100.5pH.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of lead glass {{continued through the}} twentieth century, when in 1932 scientists at the Corning Glassworks, New York State, developed a new lead glass of high optical clarity.

25|$|Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) {{wrote about}} the effects of pinhole, concave lenses, and {{magnifying}} <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> his Book of Optics. Roger Bacon used parts of glass spheres as magnifying glasses and recommended them to be used to help people read. Roger Bacon got his inspiration from Alhacen in the 11th century. He discovered that light reflects from objects rather than emanating from them.|$|E
25|$|Circular polarizers {{can also}} be used to {{selectively}} absorb or pass right-handed or left-handed circularly polarized light. It is this feature which is utilized by the 3D <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> stereoscopic cinemas such as RealD Cinema. A given polarizer which creates one of the two polarizations of light will pass that same polarization of light when that light is sent through it in the other direction. In contrast it will block light of the opposite polarization.|$|E
25|$|At this period, {{glass was}} sold by weight, and the typical forms were rather heavy and solid with minimal decoration. Such was its {{success on the}} {{international}} market, however, that in 1746, the British Government imposed a lucrative tax by weight. Rather than drastically reduce the lead content of their glass, manufacturers responded by creating highly decorated, smaller, more delicate forms, often with hollow stems, known to collectors today as Excise <b>glasses.</b> <b>In</b> 1780, the Government granted Ireland free trade in glass without taxation. English labour and capital then shifted to Dublin and Belfast, and new glassworks specialising in cut glass were installed in Cork and Waterford. In 1825, the tax was renewed, and gradually the industry declined until the mid-nineteenth century, when the tax was finally repealed.|$|E

25|$|Baird also {{demonstrated}} {{the use of}} the two-color tube as the basis for stereoscopic 3D television. In this use, the two color-filtered television cameras were separated to produce a measurable angle, and then broadcast normally. Viewers wore colored glasses to re-separate the images into the left and right eye, in a fashion identical to Anaglyph 3D movies. However, Baird also described a system using the ridged tube that eliminated the need for <b>glasses.</b> <b>In</b> this case the tube was rotated so the peaks ran vertically instead of horizontally and the red gun was removed. The guns formerly used for green and blue were now used for left and right images. The basic concept is identical to the lenticular printing system used on magazines and other printed materials to produce 3D images.|$|E
25|$|Leonard's primary health {{concern is}} his lactose intolerance: his {{consuming}} melon or any dairy products (and {{according to the}} pilot episode, even corn) results in flatulence. Leonard wears eyeglasses because of astigmatism, and cannot see without them. On one occasion, when his glasses were broken at the movie theater, he had to surreptitiously return to his apartment and retrieve his backup <b>glasses.</b> <b>In</b> order to avoid detection by a sick Sheldon and Penny, who was nursing him, Howard and Raj helped him to navigate {{through the living room}} by using a helmet camera. Leonard states in one episode that he suffers from sleep apnea. During his relationship with Leslie Winkle, he tells her that many members of his family have died from heart disease and thus he has a genetic disposition to the condition.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Hawtrey {{had become}} a regular {{participant}} in the Carry On films series. He was in the first, Carry On Sergeant (1958), and more than 20 others. His characters ranged from the wimpish through the effete to the effeminate and would always, regardless of the historical setting, be seen wearing Hawtrey's signature round <b>glasses.</b> <b>In</b> her autobiography Barbara Windsor wrote about Hawtrey's alcoholism and his outrageous flirting with the footballer George Best. While filming Carry On Spying (1964), in which they both played secret agents, Windsor thought that Hawtrey had fainted from fright at a dramatic scene on a conveyor belt. In fact he had passed out because he was drunk. When he came on set with a crate of R. White's Lemonade everyone {{knew that he had}} been on another binge.

25|$|The Labour Party {{introduced}} {{charges for}} NHS dental services and <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> 1951. The Conservatives returned {{to power in}} 1951, accepting most of Labour's postwar reforms, but introduced prescription charges to the NHS in 1952 and denationalized steel in 1953. They presided over 13 years of economic recovery and stability. However the Suez Crisis of 1956 demonstrated Britain {{was no longer a}} superpower. Ghana, Malaya, Nigeria and Kenya were granted independence during this period. Labour returned to power under Harold Wilson in 1964 and oversaw a series of social reforms including the decriminalisation of homosexuality and abortion, the relaxing of divorce laws and the banning of capital punishment. Edward Heath returned the Conservatives to power from 1970 to 1974, and oversaw the decimalisation of British currency, the ascension of Britain to the European Economic Community, and the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. In the wake of the oil crisis and a miner's strike, Heath introduced the three-day working week to conserve power.|$|E
25|$|Van Barneveld {{decided not}} to wear his <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> {{the first round of}} the 2015 World Championship and took out {{finishes}} of 167 and 170 in beating Rowby-John Rodriguez 3–0. He was then involved in three successive matches in which there was never a set between Van Barneveld and his opponent as he edged past Jamie Caven 4–3, Adrian Lewis 4–3 (Lewis missed one match dart) and Stephen Bunting 5–4. In the Bunting match he returned from a break after the fourth set with his glasses on explaining afterwards that the board was looking blurry. Van Barneveld looked to have got himself back into his semi-final meeting with Phil Taylor when he recovered from 2–0 down to draw level, but his lengthy previous matches seemed to take effect as he could not win another set to be defeated 6–2. At the Masters he knocked out newly crowned world champion Gary Anderson 11–6 in the semi-finals, but was beaten by a reversal of this scoreline against Michael van Gerwen in the final.|$|E
25|$|After {{committing}} {{to build the}} statue, Blumberg was invited to Fort Campbell, where he met veterans of Task Force Dagger. He learned that his depiction of the Green Beret wasn't at all accurate. Blumberg invited them to his studio where they worked closely with him {{to be sure he}} got the horse and soldier precisely correct. Blumberg took six weeks to re-sculpt the piece until he was sure it was accurate in every detail. It depicts a Special Forces Green Beret on horseback leading the invasion into Afghanistan. He is holding field <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> one hand. An M4 with an attached grenade launcher is slung under his shoulder. An outline of a wedding band is visible under the glove of the soldier's left hand. Blumberg said, “That’s my way of tipping my hat to wives, marriages and strain on families. It’s to acknowledge the stresses caused by multiple deployments.” Blumberg created the sculpture's face without using a model or photos. It does not represent the face of a specific individual.|$|E
