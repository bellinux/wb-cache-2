By the late 1920s, American Window Glass was forced to begin re-equipping its plants with new machinery. The company underwent a <b>financial</b> <b>reorganization</b> in 1929. Dividends on its preferred stock were lowered. Although a few plants were re-equipped, the Hartford City plant was not. [...] Hartford City's natural gas supply was depleted, {{and the type of}} sand used to produce glass was in better supply near other American Window Glass plants in Pennsylvania. Thus, American Window Glass Company plant number 3, the former Hartford City Glass Company, was closed in 1929.|$|E

2500|$|The {{result was}} the Chesterfield Railroad, a [...] mule- and gravity-powered line that {{connected}} the Midlothian coal mines with wharves located at Manchester, directly across from Richmond. Partially funded by the Virginia Board of Public Works, the railroad began operating in 1831, {{the first in the}} state. By 1852, the newer, steam-driven Richmond and Danville Railroad (R) began operation to Coalfield Station, later renamed Midlothian; it quickly supplanted the slower Chesterfield Railroad. In a <b>financial</b> <b>reorganization</b> in 1894, the R line through Midlothian became part of the Southern Railway system. It is now part of Norfolk Southern Railway.

For instance, the eventual amateur No.1 Mike King received a $14,500 Glastron boat and a Honda Reflex motorcycle valued at $1,600 for a total value of $16,100. To reiterate, the top amateur received the boat, not the professional number one. That winner got the [...] "standard" [...] automobile. The Pro number one for that year, Charles Townsend, received $1,600 in cash, a GMC Chevy S-10 pick up truck valued at $10,500 and a Honda XR250R Honda motorcycle valued at $3,500. Total value of $15,600. You had the odd situation of the amateur winning prizes of greater value collectively than the professional by a $500 margin. The amateur girls class champion Nikki Murray (unlike the NBL at this time, the ABA did not have a professional women's division) and the Pro Cruiser number one Eric Rupe also received Honda Reflex motorcycles.|$|E

40|$|Bankruptcy is {{the legal}} process whereby financially distressed firms, individuals, and {{occasionally}} governments resolve their debts. The bankruptcy process for firms plays {{a central role in}} economics, because competition drives inefficient firms out of business, thereby raising the average efficiency level of those remaining. The main economic function of corporate bankruptcy is to reduce the cost of default by having a government-sponsored procedure that resolves all debts simultaneously. The main economic function of personal bankruptcy is to provide partial consumption insurance to individual debtors and therefore reduce the social cost of debt.

40|$|In {{the recent}} <b>financial</b> crisis, <b>reorganizations</b> of distressed <b>financial</b> {{institutions}} following the good bank and bad bank model were discussed. In {{the context of}} a structural framework and under perfect information, we analyze endogenous capital structure choices of an arrangement constituted by a large regulated unit which manages the more secure assets of a bank and a smaller division - possibly unregulated - which gathers the more risky and volatile ones. We question whether such an arrangement is a priori optimal and whether financial institutions have private incentives to set up different risk-classes of assets in separate entities. We investigate the effect of intra-group guarantees on optimal leverage and expected default costs. Numerical results show that these guarantees can enhance group value and limit default costs when the firm separates its more secure from its more risky assets in regulated entities. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2012...|$|R
