And then I pray to Christ to say, 'Thank you for this day and my <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> health,' and now that I'm older I've added, 'Please illuminate me. Please open my heart chakra. Open my aperture and uplift my consciousness so that I can be the best version of myself.' ...|$|E

Radner wrote in It's Always Something: [...] "They found an old photo of me looking frightened from a 'Saturday Night Live' sketch and blew that up to make the point. What they did probably sold newspapers, {{but it had a}} devastating effect on my <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> friends. [...] It forced [...] Gene [...] to compose a press release to respond.

You can't raise the money to finance a campaign; there's too much static, and you can't communicate....Clearly, under the present circumstances, this campaign cannot go on. I refuse to submit my <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> friends and innocent people and myself to further rumors and gossip. It's simply an intolerable situation."

Shamrock responded to his critics in an interview: [...] "I trained three fighters that were the first three (UFC) Middleweight Champions: Jerry Bohlander, Guy Mezger and Frank Shamrock. And I’ve trained dozens of guys to be champs in other organizations. In Pancrase, I had eight fighters in the top ten at one point. I was the champion and (Masakatsu) Funaki was the number one contender. The rest were all Lion's Den fighters. My reputation doesn’t have to be spoken for or defended.

But that's the way I was made; I truly don't think I could help it." [...] (p.20) Martin's craft was developed by seeing movies and becoming a mimic. She would win prizes for looking, acting and dancing like Ruby Keeler and singing exactly like Bing Crosby. [...] "Never, never, never can I say I had a frustrating childhood. It was all joy.

On 14 February, two new nude photographs surfaced [...] one featuring an unidentified woman fellating Chen, and another showed a woman lying on a bed.|$|E

Starting off by filming family events like birthdays and holidays, he gradually began producing narrative films with his friends that incorporated stop-motion work and other special effects. Along with enjoying movies, Zemeckis remained an avid TV watcher. [...] "You hear {{so much about the}} problems with television," [...] he said, [...] "but I think that it saved my life." [...] Television gave Zemeckis his first glimpse of a world outside of his blue-collar upbringing; specifically, he learned of the existence of film schools on an episode of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After seeing Bonnie and Clyde with his father and being heavily influenced by it, Zemeckis decided that {{he wanted to go to}} film school. His parents disapproved of the idea, Zemeckis later said, [...] "But only in the sense that they were concerned... for my [...] <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> friends and the world that I grew up in, this was the kind of dream that really was impossible.
