40|$|This study {{examines}} how pharmaceutical costs for <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> drugs are shared between insurers and consumers. Who bears these costs {{has important implications}} for patient access to better drugs, and for differences in access to <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> pharmaceuticals. We investigate these issues using data from two large drug product classes: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antidepressants. We find that insurers shift the drug costs associated with <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> onto consumers for antidepressants but share in the costs of <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> for NSAIDs. This suggests that patients’ cost burden, hence access, to <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> drugs may vary across drug product classes. ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Highest {{quality is}} lowest cost" [...] is a Japanese {{manufacturing}} aphorism {{based on the}} premise that the <b>highest</b> <b>quality</b> manufacturer will earn a reputation that makes buyers prefer, price being reasonably similar, to buy its goods. This means that the manufacturer will produce more than its competitors, and thus will both have economies of scale and be able to accept a lower profit per unit—thus the <b>highest</b> <b>quality</b> goods will have a lower cost by driving other goods from the market. The production of <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> goods can also reduce quality costs.|$|R

40|$|This paper rigorously {{analyzes}} equilibria {{of mixed}} duopoly with vertically differentiated services under the finiteness property that marginal {{cost of quality}} ”gradually ” increases.

In the first (third) type, the public (private) firm serves the whole market, whereas only either firm serves the entire market in the second type. In all these equilibria, all consumers are provided for the <b>highest</b> <b>quality</b> service and total surplus is maximized. These results suggest another justification for the public firm in some industries suc...|$|R
