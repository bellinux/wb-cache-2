5|$|Deodato said he {{conceived}} {{of the film}} while talking to his son about {{news coverage of the}} terrorism of the Red Brigades. Deodato thought that the media focused on portraying violence with little regard for journalistic integrity and believed that the media staged certain news angles in order to obtain more sensational footage. <b>He</b> <b>reflected</b> this behavior in the film team in Cannibal Holocaust, whom he said symbolized the Italian media.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, {{the scope}} of his work expanded. On the one hand, Phipps wished to avoid rehashing the same {{information}} that was available, but the careers of the marshals required some duplication. The published works were often filled with inconsistencies, {{not only in the}} French sources, but from the French to the English sources. The French sources frequently misinterpreted the English sources, and vice versa. Phipps wrote both an introduction to his work and a summary of the histories of the armies of the Republic and the Consulate, from 1791 to 1804, and at certain points in his narrative, he paused to review the positions of the various future marshals and other well-known generals. <b>He</b> <b>reflected</b> on the development of their experience, the characteristics of their leadership, and the relationships to one another and to Napoleon. Critically, he posited that generals rarely improved with practice.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta had {{continued}} writing articles, in which <b>he</b> <b>reflected</b> Padmore's influence. He produced {{an article for}} a January 1933 issue of the Negro Worker, and then another for a November 1933 issue of Labour Monthly. He also wrote the entry on Kenya for Negro, an anthology edited by Nancy Cunard and published in 1934. In these, he took a more extreme position than {{he had in the}} past, calling for complete self-rule in Kenya. In doing so he was virtually alone among political Kenyans, with figures like Thuku and Jesse Kariuki being far less radical in their demands. The pro-independence sentiments {{that he was able to}} express in Britain would not have been permitted in Kenya itself.|$|E
5|$|Though Tucker and Maria {{were warned}} against her having more {{children}} in her vulnerable physical and emotional state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled {{his face with a}} handkerchief to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as <b>he</b> <b>reflected</b> on his plausible neglect in the midst of her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years later would result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.|$|E
50|$|Now {{married and}} {{adjusting}} {{to life as}} a new father, Son thinks a lot about his life prior to Rose and Sissy. <b>He</b> <b>reflects</b> on his time as a teenager, starting with his roller coaster romance with a girl named Cecelia, enlisting in the army, and having to leave abruptly.

5|$|Although Phra Candasaro {{had studied}} with many masters, and had {{mastered}} many important Pali texts, {{he was not}} satisfied. He withdrew himself in the more peaceful area of his hometown twice. Some sources state he also withdrew himself in the jungles to meditate more, but Newell doubts this. In the eleventh rains retreat (vassa) after his ordination, in 1916, he stayed at Wat Botbon at Bangkuvieng, Nonthaburi Province. Wat Botbon was the temple {{where he used to}} receive education as a child, a temple known for its peacefulness. As seen from Luang Pu Sodh's autobiographical notes, <b>he</b> <b>reflected</b> to himself that he had been practicing meditation for many years and had still not understood the essential knowledge which the Buddha had taught. Thus, on the full-moon day in the tenth lunar month of 1916, he sat down in the main shrine hall of Wat Botbon, resolving not to waver in his practice of sitting meditation, whatever might disturb his single-mindedness. That same night he experienced in meditation {{what became known as the}} attainment of the Dhammakaya, which marked the start of Dhammakaya meditation as a tradition.|$|E

25|$|After the {{war ended}} and {{first-class}} cricket resumed, the 35-year-old Oldfield could not agree terms with Lancashire and left. In later years, <b>he</b> <b>reflected</b> {{that it had been}} a mistake to leave Lancashire. In the 151 first-class matches he played for Lancashire, Oldfield scored 7,002 runs at an average of 35.72 with 12 centuries.|$|E
25|$|Through {{an adult}} class at a Methodist church {{he learned of}} the Casa de Todos clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, in about 1960. <b>He</b> <b>reflected</b> on the {{experience}} in a 1967 article. There {{he was able to}} save the lives of two children during a period he volunteered one day a week. But he found he needed to do something more substantial than just be one doctor in one place of need. He initiated Project Concern to organize the work and it was incorporated in 1961. He first focused on Casa de Todos.|$|E

25|$|Bell's {{own home}} used a {{primitive}} form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice. He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution. Methane gas, he reasoned, could be produced from {{the waste of}} farms and factories. At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia, he experimented with composting toilets and devices to capture water from the atmosphere. In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, <b>he</b> <b>reflected</b> {{on the possibility of}} using solar panels to heat houses.|$|E
25|$|The many sermons of Anthony of Padua (1195–1231) on the Virgin Mary {{reflect his}} belief in various Marian doctrines that were {{declared}} as dogmas centuries after his death. <b>He</b> <b>reflected</b> on the Assumption of Mary and referring to Psalm 132 argued that, just as Jesus had risen up to Heaven, so did Mary. He also supported Mary's freedom from sin and her Immaculate Conception. Given that Anthony {{was one of the}} best educated and articulate of the early Franciscans, he was treated as a Doctor of the Church by his order, even before the title was granted to him in 1946.|$|E
25|$|Brentford manager Harry Curtis {{prepared}} conservatively for the 1948–49 Second Division season, with inside forward Viv Woodward and wing half Paddy Harris {{being his}} only {{additions to the}} first team. It was announced {{on the eve of}} the season that Curtis would step down from the manager's position at the end of the campaign and <b>he</b> <b>reflected</b> the need to build for the future with his signing of youngster Les Devonshire in May 1948 and over the course of the following five months, Jimmy Anders, Micky Bull and Billy Dare would all sign, though Dare would go on to be the only one of the quartet to make an impact on the first team.|$|E

25|$|Monnet firmly {{believed}} that the only path to an Allied victory lay in combining the war efforts of Britain and France, and <b>he</b> <b>reflected</b> on a concept that would coordinate war resources. In 1914, young Monnet was allowed to meet French Premier René Viviani on this issue and he managed to convince the French government to agree with him, in principle. However, {{during the first two}} years of the war, Monnet did not have much success pressing for a better organization of the allied economic cooperation. It was not until two years later that stronger combines like the Wheat Executive (end of 1916) and the Allied Maritime Transport Council (end of 1917) were set into motion, adding to the overall war effort.|$|E
25|$|Rush's {{departure}} from Liverpool had sparked {{the acquisition of}} new strikers John Aldridge (whose physical resemblance to Rush was often remarked upon) and Peter Beardsley, and on {{his return to the}} Liverpool side he was partnered alongside these players to form a 4–3–3 formation. Rush's former strike partner Kenny Dalglish (who had been appointed player-manager in 1985) was still registered as a player but by then he was in his 37th year and rarely played in the first team, retiring completely in 1990. Rush published a diary of his frustrating time in Italy titled My Italian Diary, 1989. In it, <b>he</b> <b>reflected</b> on his struggles to integrate himself in the dressing room at Juventus and adapt to the Italian style of play.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle's {{policy was}} to {{postpone}} elections {{as long as}} 2.6 million French were in Germany as prisoners of war and forced laborers. In mid-September, he embarked upon a tour of major provincial cities to increase his public profile and to help cement his position. Although he received a largely positive reception from the crowds who came out to see him, <b>he</b> <b>reflected</b> {{that only a few}} months previously the very same people had come out to cheer Marshal Pétain when he was serving the Vichy regime. Raymond Aubrac said that the General showed himself to be ill-at-ease at social functions; in Marseille and Lyon he became irate when he had to sit next to former Resistance leaders and also voiced his distaste for the rowdy, libidinous behavior of French youths during the Maquisard parades which preceded his speech. When he reached Toulouse, de Gaulle also had to confront the leaders of a group which had proclaimed themselves to be the provincial government of the city.|$|E
