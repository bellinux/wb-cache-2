5|$|The USB 3.1 Type-C {{connector}} is {{an emerging}} standard which has replaced legacy video connectors such as mDP, Thunderbolt, HDMI and VGA in mobile devices. USB-C connectors can transmit <b>DisplayPort</b> video to docks and displays using standard USB Type-C cables or Type-C to <b>DisplayPort</b> cables and adapters; USB-C also supports HDMI adapters which perform active conversion from <b>DisplayPort</b> to HDMI 1.4 or 2.0. <b>DisplayPort</b> Alternate Mode for USB Type-C specification {{was published in}} 2015. USB Type-C chipsets {{are not required to}} include Dual-mode trasnmitters and only support <b>DisplayPort</b> LVDS protocol, so passive DP-HDMI adapters would not work with Type-C sources.|$|E
5|$|<b>DisplayPort</b> {{connector}} {{is compatible}} with HDMI and can trasmit single-link DVI and HDMI 1.2/1.4/2.0 signals using attached passive adapters or adapter cables. The source device includes a dual-mode transmitter which supports both LVDS signals used by <b>DisplayPort</b> and TMDS signals used by DVI/HDMI. The same external connector is used for both protocols - when DVI/HDMI passive adapter is attached, the transmitter circuit switches to TDMS mode. <b>DisplayPort</b> Dual-mode ports and cables/adapters are typically marked with the DisplayPort++ logo. Thunderbolt ports with mDP connector also supports Dual-mode passive HDMI adapters/cables. Conversion to dual-link DVI and component video (VGA/YPbPr) requires active powered adapters.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{has a few}} {{advantages}} over <b>DisplayPort,</b> such as ability to carry Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) signals, and electrical compatibility with DVI (though practically limited to single-link DVI rates). Also, HDMI can sustain full bandwidth for up to 10 meters of cable length and there are certification programs to ensure this; <b>DisplayPort</b> cables, conversely, don't ensure full bandwidth beyond 3 meters.|$|E
50|$|N600: Introduced in 2015, it {{equipped}} two <b>DisplayPorts</b> {{to support}} native dual monitor features.|$|R
50|$|A Surface Dock was {{announced}} alongside the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4, and {{is compatible with}} both devices. It is also backward compatible with the Surface Pro 3. The Surface Dock adds two Mini <b>DisplayPorts,</b> one Gigabit Ethernet, four USB 3.0 and one audio out port to the 2-in-1.|$|R
50|$|The Surface Dock is a {{redesigned}} docking accessory in a brick form factor. It {{is compatible}} with all past and future Surface models with a SurfaceConnect side port, previously used to connect a wall charger or Docking Station accessory: Surface Pro 3, 4 and Surface Book. The Surface Dock will have 2 Mini <b>DisplayPorts,</b> 1 Gigabit Ethernet, 4 USB 3.0, and 1 audio out ports.|$|R
5|$|For the unibody {{polycarbonate}} MacBook (2009), {{the ports}} {{from left to}} right are the MagSafe power connector, Gigabit Ethernet, Mini <b>DisplayPort,</b> 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio out and Kensington Security Slot.|$|E
5|$|<b>DisplayPort</b> uses a self-clocking, micro-packet-based {{protocol}} {{that allows}} for a variable number of differential LVDS lanes as well as flexible allocation of bandwidth between audio and video, and allows encapsulating multi-channel compressed audio formats in the audio stream. <b>DisplayPort</b> 1.2 supports multiple audio/video streams, variable refresh rate (FreeSync), Display Stream Compression (DSC), and Dual-mode LVDS/TDMS transmitters compatible with HDMI 1.2 or 1.4. Revision 1.3 increases overall transmission bandwidth to 32.4Gbit/s with the new HBR3 mode featuring 8.1Gbit/s per lane; it requires Dual-mode with mandatory HDMI 2.0 compatibility and HDCP 2.2. Revision 1.4 adds support BT.2020 color space and HDR10 extensions from CTA-861.3, including static and dynamic metadata.|$|E
5|$|Thunderbolt {{combines}} PCI Express and Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> {{into a new}} {{serial data}} interface. Original Thunderbolt implementations have two channels, each with a transfer speed of 10Gbit/s, resulting in an aggregate unidirectional bandwidth of 20Gbit/s.|$|E
5|$|The chipset {{brought a}} 1066MHz system bus, use of DDR3 system memory, and {{integrated}} Nvidia GeForce 9400M graphics. Other changes include a display which uses LED backlights (replacing the fluorescent tube backlights {{used in the}} previous model) and arsenic-free glass, a new Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> (replacing the polycarbonate MacBook's mini-DVI port), a multi-touch glass trackpad which also acts as the mouse button, {{and the removal of}} the FireWire 400 port (thus it doesn't support Target Disk Mode, used for data transfers or operating system repairs without booting the system).|$|E
5|$|All ports {{have been}} {{replaced}} with either two or four combination USB-C 3.1 ports that support Thunderbolt 3 and dual <b>DisplayPort</b> 1.2 signals, any {{of which can be}} used for charging. The MacBook Pro is incompatible with some older Thunderbolt 3 certified peripherals, including Intel's own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices. Furthermore, MacOS on MacBook Pro blocks certain classes of Thunderbolt 3 compatible devices from working by blacklisting them. Devices using HDMI, previous generation Thunderbolt, and USB will require an adapter to connect to the MacBook Pro. The models come with a 3.5 mm headphone jack, although TOSLINK functionality of older generation MacBook Pros has been removed.|$|E
5|$|For {{external}} connectivity, the Mac Pro included five USB 2.0 ports, two FireWire 400 and two FireWire 800 (Late 2006 until Early 2008), respectively four FireWire 800 (Early 2009 until Mid 2012) ports. Networking {{was supported}} with two built-in Gigabit Ethernet ports. 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi support (AirPort Extreme) required an optional module in the Mid 2006, Early 2008 and Early 2009 models, {{whereas in the}} 2010 model and later Wi-Fi was standard. Bluetooth also required an optional module in the Mid 2006 model, but was standard in the Early 2008 and newer models. Displays were supported by one or (optionally) more PCIe graphics cards. More recent cards featured two Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> connectors and one dual-link Digital Visual Interface (DVI) port, with various configurations of on-card graphics memory available.|$|E
5|$|On October 20, 2009, Apple {{released}} a MacBook that {{introduced a new}} polycarbonate (plastic) unibody design, faster DDR3 memory, a multi-touch trackpad, an LED-backlit display, and a built-in seven-hour battery. The polycarbonate unibody MacBook, like its aluminum predecessor, lacks FireWire and, like the 13-inch MacBook Pro, has a combined audio in/out port. There is no infrared port and the Apple Remote is not included. On May 18, 2010, the MacBook was refreshed with a faster processor, a faster graphics card, improved battery life, {{and the ability to}} pass audio through the Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> connector. On July 20, 2011, the MacBook was discontinued for consumer purchases, but was still available to educational institutions until February 2012.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the MacBook Air, the MacBook {{follows the}} same design first {{seen in the}} MacBook Pro; however, it is rounder on the edges than {{previous}} laptops in the MacBook line. This model has an all-white fingerprint-resistant glossy palm rest, unlike the grayish surface of its predecessor, and uses a multi-touch glass trackpad like the one found on the MacBook Pro. The video-out port is Mini <b>DisplayPort.</b> The bottom of the MacBook features a rubberized non-slip finish. The built-in battery of the late 2009 revision, a feature introduced {{earlier in the year}} with the MacBook Pro, is claimed by Apple to last seven hours compared with five hours in the older models. However, in tests conducted by Macworld, the battery was found to last only about four hours while playing video at full brightness with AirPort turned off. However, Apple's battery life was calculated with the brightness at the middle setting and while browsing websites and editing word documents, not with video and at full brightness. Gizmodo also reached about the same conclusion in their tests, but with AirPort turned on. The battery included in the mid-2010 model holds an additional five watt-hours over the previous model's and is claimed to last up to ten hours.|$|E
25|$|Like the 2009 version, a Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> (which {{allows for}} a VGA connection, via a non-included cable) is included. A HDMI port, which Apple {{describes}} as being HDMI 1.4 compliant, replaces the Mini-DVI port on the prior models {{as one of the}} main video connection methods. The HDMI port supports up to 1080p on HDMI connections and 8 channel 24-bit audio at 192kHz, Dolby Surround 5.1 and stereo output. With the included HDMI to DVI adapter, for those currently using a DVI interface, the HDMI port will work with resolutions up to 1920 × 1200 pixels, while the Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> can concurrently support a resolution up to 2560 × 1600 pixels.|$|E
25|$|The I/O ports {{were changed}} with the early 2009 revision. A fifth USB 2.0 port was added and the FireWire 400 port was {{replaced}} with a FireWire 800 port. The AirPort card was upgraded to 802.11a/b/g/draft-n and later to 802.11a/b/g/n. Bluetooth was also upgraded from 2.0 to 2.1. Instead of a single full-size DVI port, a Mini-DVI port was added along with a Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> connection, which allows dual display support. Unlike the DVI port, the Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> supports external displays with a resolution up to 2560×1600, which allows use of the 30-inch Cinema Display with the Mac Mini. As of this revision, the Apple Remote is no longer included with the Mac Mini.|$|E
25|$|Classed {{as small}} {{form-factor}} PCs, Chromeboxes typically feature a power switch {{and a set}} of ports: local area network, USB, DVI-D, <b>DisplayPort,</b> and audio. As with Chromebooks, Chromeboxes employ solid-state memory and support Web applications, but require an external monitor, keyboard, and pointing device.|$|E
25|$|On February 24, 2011, Apple {{became the}} first company to bring to market a {{computer}} that utilized Intel's new Thunderbolt (codename Light Peak) I/O interface. Using the same physical interface as a Mini <b>DisplayPort,</b> and backwards compatible with that standard, Thunderbolt boasts two-way transfer speeds of 10Gbit/s.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 models {{include two}} {{speakers}} for stereo sound while earlier versions have one speaker located under the keyboard. The 2011 model replaces <b>DisplayPort</b> with a Thunderbolt 1 port, {{and also has}} a 1280×720 FaceTime HD Camera, replacing the previous 640×480 iSight camera. The 2012 model replaces USB 2 with USB 3, and uses the MagSafe 2 instead of the MagSafe connector for charging. The 2015 model updated the Thunderbolt port to Thunderbolt 2.|$|E
25|$|Steve Jobs {{introduced}} the first MacBook Air during {{a speech at}} his keynote at the 2008 Macworld conference on January 15, 2008. The first-generation MacBook Air was a 13.3"-only model, initially promoted as the world's thinnest notebook. It featured a custom Intel Merom CPU and Intel GMA graphics. In late 2008, the CPU was updated to a faster, non-custom Penryn CPU and integrated Nvidia GeForce graphics while the hard drive capacity was increased and the micro-DVI video port {{was replaced by the}} Mini <b>DisplayPort.</b> A mid-2009 refresh, introduced alongside the MacBook Pro family, featured a slightly higher-capacity battery, and a faster Penryn CPU.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the similar}} small form factor, HDMI port, remote control IR receiver, and media browser {{interface}}, some users see the Mac Mini as an Apple TV alternative. It has both iTunes for media rental, purchase, and management, and a native user interface with Front Row, {{based on the}} user interface of the original Apple TV. The Apple TV is limited to video in the MP4 format, whereas Mac Mini users employing the appropriate QuickTime codecs can watch other video formats like Divx, Xvid, and the Matroska (Mkv) container, or almost all other formats using an open source player such as VLC, without resorting to hacks. The current Intel models of Mac Mini can display video via the HDMI port at a maximum resolution of 1920x1200 and up to 2560x1600 via the Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> with a compatible monitor.|$|E
500|$|<b>DisplayPort</b> audio/video {{interface}} {{was introduced}} in May 2006. In the recent years, <b>DisplayPort</b> connectors have become a common feature of premium products -- displays, desktop computers, and video cards; most of the companies producing <b>DisplayPort</b> equipment are in the computer sector. The <b>DisplayPort</b> website states that <b>DisplayPort</b> is expected to complement HDMI, but as of 2016 100% of the HD and 4K TVs had HDMI connectivity. <b>DisplayPort</b> supported few advanced features -- e.g. 5K, Adaptive-Sync -- which were quite useful for multimedia content creators or gamers. This was the reason most of the GPUs had <b>DisplayPort</b> on them. These features {{were added to the}} official HDMI specification bit later. But with the introduction of HDMI 2.1 these gaps are already leveled off.|$|E
500|$|The HDMI Alternate Mode for USB-C allows HDMI enabled sources with a USB-C {{connector}} {{to directly}} connect to standard HDMI [...] display devices, without requiring an adapter or dongle. The standard {{was released in}} September 2016, and supports all HDMI 1.4b features such as video resolutions up to 4K Ultra HD 30 Hz, and Consumer Electronic Control (CEC). Previously, the similar <b>DisplayPort</b> Alternate Mode {{could be used to}} connect to HDMI displays from USB Type-C sources, but where in that case, active adapters were required to convert from <b>DisplayPort</b> to HDMI, HDMI Alternate Mode connects to the display natively.|$|E
500|$|<b>DisplayPort</b> has a royalty rate of US$0.20 {{per unit}} (from patents {{licensed}} by MPEG LA), although this claim is contested, while HDMI has an annual fee of US$10,000 and a per unit royalty rate of between $0.15 and $0.04.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, it was {{announced}} that several computer vendors and display makers including Intel, AMD, Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, and LG [...] would stop using LVDS (actually, FPD-Link) from 2013 and legacy DVI and VGA connectors from 2015, replacing them with <b>DisplayPort</b> and HDMI.|$|E
500|$|CNET {{praised the}} {{automatic}} graphics switching {{features of the}} 15- and 17-inch 2010 models {{as well as the}} graphics cards themselves. Acclaim was also given to the Core i5 and i7 CPUs, the multi-touch trackpad, and the addition of audio capabilities to the Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> video output. They also called for the addition of HDMI and the Blu-ray optical disc format, saying that most other computers in the MacBook Pro's price range possessed these features. CNET also criticized the option of a higher resolution screen in the 15-inch model, saying that [...] "the higher-resolution screen should be included by default." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 14, 2008, in a {{press event}} at company headquarters, Apple {{officials}} announced a new 15-inch MacBook Pro featuring a [...] "precision aluminum unibody enclosure" [...] and tapered sides {{similar to those of}} the MacBook Air. Designers shifted the MacBook Pro's ports to the left side of the case, and moved the optical disc drive slot from the front to the right side, similar to the MacBook. The new MacBook Pros had two video cards, which the user could switch between: the Nvidia GeForce 9600M GT with either 256 or 512MB of dedicated memory and a GeForce 9400M with 256MB of shared system memory. Although the FireWire 400 port was removed, the FireWire 800 port was retained. The DVI port was replaced with a Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> receptacle. The original unibody MacBook Pro came with a user-removable battery; Apple claimed five hours of use, with one reviewer reporting results closer to four on a continuous video battery stress test. Apple said that the battery would hold 80percent of its charge after 300 recharges.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{lamented the}} loss of a matte screen option for the 2008 unibody MacBook Pro, noting the reflectiveness of the screen in sunlight, even when its {{brightness}} was turned all the way up. CNET's Dan Ackerman commented of the mid-2009 models: [...] "According to Apple, the new display offers a wider color gamut, and the screen certainly looks bright and colorful, but we wish the same matte-screen option offered on the 17-inch MacBook Pro was available across the line... While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits, the edge-to-edge glass covering the entire display panel grabs stray light rays with ease, making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions." [...] By 2011, matte screens were offered for both the 15" [...] and 17" [...] models. Furthermore, the addition of Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> instead of the more popular HDMI was criticized. The relatively low number of ports and lower end technical specifications when compared to similarly priced laptops from other brands were also bemoaned.|$|E
2500|$|Standard PC {{units are}} usually {{connected}} to a CRT or LCD display, while HTPCs {{are designed to be}} {{connected to a}} television. [...] All HTPCs should feature a TV-out option, using either an HDMI, DVI, <b>DisplayPort,</b> Component video, VGA (for some LCD televisions), S-Video, or Composite video output.|$|E
2500|$|On the 11" [...] Air, {{the left}} side of the {{computer}} has a MagSafe power connector, a USB port, a headphone jack, and a microphone. The right side of the computer has a USB port and a Mini <b>DisplayPort,</b> now sharing Thunderbolt function beginning with the 2011 model. On top of the screen bezel there is a webcam, first dubbed iSight and now the FaceTime camera.|$|E
2500|$|On July 20, 2011, Apple {{released}} updates to the 11.6" [...] and 13.3" [...] {{models of}} the MacBook Air, which also became Apple's entry-level laptops due to lowered prices and the discontinuation of the white MacBook around the same time. The mid-2011 MacBook Airs were powered by the new Sandy Bridge 1.6 or 1.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, or 1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processors, that came with an Intel HD Graphics 3000 processor, and with a backlit keyboard, two USB 2.0 ports, FaceTime camera, a standard of 2 GB of RAM (configurable up to 4 GB), Thunderbolt which shares function with Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> and Bluetooth was upgraded to v4.0. Maximum SSD flash memory storage options were increased up to 256 GB. [...] Both 11" [...] and 13" [...] models had an analog audio output/headphone minijack (that also supports an iPhone/iPod touch headset with microphone), but only the 13" [...] model had an integrated SDXC-capable SD Card slot. These models use a less expensive [...] "Eagle Ridge" [...] Thunderbolt controller that provides two Thunderbolt channels (2 × 10 Gbit/s bidirectional), compared to the MacBook Pro which uses a [...] "Light Ridge" [...] controller that provides four Thunderbolt channels (4 × 10 Gbit/s bidirectional). A USB ethernet adapter was immediately available upon release and a Thunderbolt-to-Firewire 800 adapter became available in mid-year 2012.|$|E
5000|$|Using two {{or three}} <b>DisplayPort</b> connections, as they require only a single pixel clock for all connections. Passive {{adapters}} from <b>DisplayPort</b> to some other connector rely on the chipset being able to emit a non-DisplayPort signal through the <b>DisplayPort</b> connector, and thus do not count as a <b>DisplayPort</b> connection. Active adapters that contain additional logic to convert the <b>DisplayPort</b> signal to some other format count as a <b>DisplayPort</b> connection.|$|E
50|$|<b>DisplayPort</b> 1.2 {{added support}} for Multi-Stream Transport (MST), {{enabling}} multiple monitors {{to be used}} via a single <b>DisplayPort</b> connector. This function requires either monitors {{that are capable of}} <b>DisplayPort</b> 1.2 daisy-chaining, or use of a <b>DisplayPort</b> MST Hub. The first MST hub became available in September 2013, enabling up to 3 displays to be connected to a single <b>DisplayPort</b> connector.|$|E
50|$|Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> (mDP) is a {{standard}} announced by Apple {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2008. Shortly after announcing Mini <b>DisplayPort,</b> Apple announced that it would license the connector technology with no fee. The following year, in early 2009, VESA announced that Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> would be included in the upcoming <b>DisplayPort</b> 1.2 specification.On 24 February 2011, Apple and Intel announced Thunderbolt, a successor to Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> which adds support for PCI Express data connections while maintaining backwards compatibility with Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> based peripherals.|$|E
50|$|Another audio/video {{interface}} is <b>DisplayPort,</b> version 1.0, {{which was}} approved in May 2006. Several models of display, computer, and video cards have <b>DisplayPort</b> ports. The <b>DisplayPort</b> website states that <b>DisplayPort</b> {{is expected to}} complement HDMI. Most of the companies producing equipment that uses <b>DisplayPort</b> are in the computer sector. <b>DisplayPort</b> uses a self-clocking, micro-packet-based protocol that allows for a variable number of differential lanes as well as flexible allocation of bandwidth between audio and video, and allows encapsulating multi-channel compressed audio formats in the audio stream.|$|E
50|$|Unlike its Mini-DVI and Micro-DVI predecessors, the Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> {{can drive}} display devices with resolutions up to 2560×1600 (WQXGA) in its <b>DisplayPort</b> 1.1a implementation, and 4096×2160 (4K) in its <b>DisplayPort</b> 1.2 implementation. With an adapter, the Mini <b>DisplayPort</b> can drive display devices with VGA, DVI, or HDMI interfaces.|$|E
