According to Cassius Dio, his most stable relationship seems to have been with his chariot driver, a blond slave from Caria named Hierocles, whom he referred to as his husband.|$|E
5|$|Dr Sadiq Alekry, a 44-year-old plastic surgeon, voluntarily {{offered his}} {{services}} at the roundabout {{on the evening of}} 16February, shortly after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> from Houston. According to Human rights watch, Alekry along with other staff were wearing special medical jackets showing the Red Crescent. During the raid, riot police attacked his tent and cut through it; despite telling them he was a physician, police handcuffed him from his back and a number of security officers repeatedly punched, kicked and hit him with sticks on his head {{and other parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{graduation}} from Purdue, Armstrong {{decided to become}} an experimental research test pilot. He applied at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base, which was later redesignated as the ‘‘NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center’’ in 2014. Although the committee had no open positions, it forwarded his application to the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland, where Armstrong began working in March 1955. Armstrong's stint at Cleveland lasted a couple of months, and by July 1955 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> to Edwards AFB for a new job.|$|E

5|$|He {{became an}} agent to take {{acknowledgements}} to instruments on September12, 1884. On January 1, 1886, he {{was listed as}} one of the speakers at a political rally at Halawa. He later {{became a member of the}} Hui Kālaiʻāina (Hawaiian Political Association), a political group founded in 1888 to oppose the Bayonet Constitution and promote Native Hawaiian leadership in the government. After the adoption of the constitution, White gave a speech in Hilo speaking out against it. He criticized the exclusion of the Chinese and Japanese from the vote, especially focusing on the latter group because of Hawaii's treaty with the Empire of Japan. By 1890, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> to his native island of Maui.|$|E
5|$|In October 1783, the Virginia Legislature {{authorized}} Scott {{to commission}} superintendents and surveyors {{to survey the}} lands given to soldiers for their service in the Revolutionary War. Enticed by glowing reports of Kentucky by his friend, James Wilkinson, he arranged for a cabin to be built for him near the Kentucky River, although the builder apparently laid only the cornerstone. Scott first visited Kentucky in mid-1785. Traveling with Peyton Short, one of Wilkinson's business partners, he came to Limestone (present-day Maysville, Kentucky) via the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers. Scott and Short then traveled overland to the Kentucky River to examine the land they would later claim. Scott's stay in Kentucky was a short one; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> to his farm in Virginia by September 1785.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two years}} before his return to Germany, Accum had {{published}} {{a number of books}} dealing with nutrition chemistry. In 1820, he published two works, one on beer production (A Treatise on the Art of Brewing) and another on wine (A Treatise on the Art of Making Wine). The following year appeared Culinary Chemistry, in which Accum provided practical information about the scientific basis of cooking. He also published a book on bread (A Treatise on the Art of Making Good and Wholesome Bread). Even when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> to Germany, his works continued to be reprinted and were translated into French, Italian and German, reaching a wide readership in Europe, {{as well as in the}} US after it was reprinted there.|$|E

In Massasoit's first {{contact with the}} English, several men of his tribe {{had been killed in}} an unprovoked attack by English sailors. He also knew of the Pilgrims' theft of the corn stores in their landings at Provincetown. Squanto had been abducted in 1614 by English explorer Thomas Hunt and had spent five years in Europe, first as a slave for a group of Spanish monks, then in England. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> to New England in 1619, acting as a guide to explorer Capt.

5|$|On {{his way to}} Rome Wilfrid {{stopped in}} Frisia to visit Willibrord. Following Wilfrid's arrival in Rome the pope held a council, which {{declared}} that the King of Northumbria should follow the earlier papal decrees restoring Wilfrid to his see. Wilfrid was disconcerted {{to find that the}} papal court spoke Greek, and his biographer noted that Wilfrid was displeased when the pope discussed the appeal with advisers in a language Wilfrid could not understand. The pope also ordered another council to be held in Britain to decide the issue, and ordered the attendance of Bosa, Berhtwald and Wilfrid. On his journey back to England Wilfrid had a seizure at Meaux, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> to Kent by 705.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{state that}} {{following}} King Edward the Confessor's death in 1066, it was Ealdred who crowned Harold Godwinson as King of England. Ealdred supported Harold as king, but when Harold was defeated at the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred backed Edgar the Ætheling and then endorsed King William the Conqueror, the Duke of Normandy and a distant relative of King Edward's. Ealdred crowned King William on Christmas Day in 1066. William never quite trusted Ealdred {{or the other}} English leaders, and Ealdred had to accompany William back to Normandy in 1067, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> to York {{by the time of}} his death in 1069. Ealdred supported the churches and monasteries in his diocese with gifts and building projects.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} that Bamber, motivated by hatred and greed, had left White House Farm around 10pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, {{to drive to}} his home in Head Street, Goldhanger. Later, perhaps {{in the early hours of}} the morning of 7 August, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> to the farm on his mother's bicycle—which he had borrowed a few days earlier—cycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the house from the back. He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with the silencer attached, and gone upstairs.|$|E
5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} before the 2008 season about where Bonds might play. However, no one signed {{him during the}} 2008 or 2009 seasons. If <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> to Major League Baseball, Bonds would have been within close range of several significant hitting milestones: needing just 65 hits to reach 3,000, 4 runs batted in to reach 2,000, and 38 home runs to reach 800. He would have needed 69 more runs scored to move past Rickey Henderson as the all-time runs champion, and 37 extra base hits to move past Hank Aaron as the all-time extra base hits champion.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{he finally}} sailed into Piraeus where {{the crowd had}} gathered, {{desiring}} to see the famous Alcibiades. He entered the harbor full of fear till he saw his cousin and others {{of his friends and}} acquaintance, who invited him to land. Upon arriving on shore he was greeted with a hero's welcome. Nevertheless, some saw an evil omen in the fact that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> to Athens on the very day when the ceremony of the Plynteria (the feast where the old statue of Athena would get cleansed) was being celebrated. This was regarded as the unluckiest day of the year to undertake anything of importance. His enemies took note of this and kept it in mind for a future occasion.|$|E

5|$|Aberdour Castle was {{reserved}} to his mother-in-law, Countess Katherine, until 1564, when Mary, Queen of Scots, confirmed Morton's {{right to the}} whole barony of Dalkeith and Aberdour. In 1566, Morton was involved in planning a rebellion against the Queen, {{which resulted in the}} murder of Queen Mary's secretary, David Riccio, but failed to gain further momentum, and Morton was forced to flee to England. However, {{by the end of the}} year <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned,</b> and by July the following year, Mary was imprisoned and had been forced to abdicate by the Scottish noblemen. Morton was appointed Regent of Scotland, for the child King James VI in 1572. He undertook extensions to the castle in the 1570s, rebuilding the south block of c. 1500, and extending it further south to form the present central range. He also drew inspiration from contemporary gardens in England, such as Hampton Court, in laying out the terraced gardens. The Privy Council met at Aberdour Castle in August 1576, but Morton's regency came to an end in 1578. He was later implicated in the 1567 murder of Queen Mary's husband, Lord Darnley, and executed in 1581 on the orders of the young King.|$|E
5|$|After {{his work}} at the UN, Soedjatmoko {{attempted}} to study at Harvard's Littauer Center for Public Administration (now the John F. Kennedy School of Government); however, he was forced to resign due to pressure from other work, including serving as Indonesia's first chargé d'affaires in London for three months as well as establishing the political desk at the Embassy of Indonesia in Washington, D.C. By 1952 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> to Indonesia, where he became involved in the socialist press and joined the Socialist Party of Indonesia. He was elected {{as a member of the}} Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia in 1955, serving until 1959; he married Ratmini Gandasubrata in 1958. However, as President Sukarno's government became more authoritarian Soedjatmoko began to criticise the government. To avoid censorship, he spent two years as a guest lecturer at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and another three in self-imposed unemployment in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|In total, Crawford {{played in}} eight games in 1919, scoring 488 runs and taking 20 wickets. Wisden commented that his batting {{was as good}} as it had ever been, but his bowling lacked spin and accuracy. He played only four more times in {{first-class}} cricket. Part of the explanation was that he joined Dunlop Rubber as a manager at one of its mills in Rochdale. He played as an amateur for Rochdale Cricket Club in 1920, but by 1921 he had left the club—the Manchester Guardian speculated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> to Surrey. He returned to live with his family in Merton Park, and played for the local cricket club. Of his first-class matches, one was for Surrey against the Australian touring team of 1921 and the others were for teams representing the Gentlemen. In his entire first-class career, Crawford scored 9,488 runs at an average of 32.60 and took 815 wickets at 20.66.|$|E

5|$|It {{is alleged}} that Amin became radicalised during his second {{stay in the}} United States in 1962, when he {{enrolled}} in a work-study group at the University of Wisconsin. Amin studied in the doctoral programme at the Columbia University Teachers College, but started to neglect his studies in favour of politics; in 1963 he became head of the Afghan students' association at the college. When he returned to Afghanistan in the mid-1960s, the route flew to Afghanistan by way of Moscow. There, Amin met the Afghan ambassador to the Soviet Union, his old friend Ali Ahmad Popel, a previous Afghan Minister of Education. During his short stay, Amin became even more radicalised. Some people, Nabi Misdaq for instance, do not believe he travelled through Moscow, but rather West Germany and Lebanon. By the time <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> to Afghanistan, the Communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) had already held its founding congress, which was in 1965. Amin ran {{as a candidate for}} the PDPA in the 1965 parliamentary election, and lost by a margin of less than fifty votes.|$|E

5|$|Maximilian Reichsgraf von Spee (22 June 1861 – 8 December 1914) was a {{naval officer}} of the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy), who famously {{commanded}} the German East Asia Squadron during World War I.

During his time in Germany in the late 1880s and early 1890s, he married his wife, Margareta, and had three children, his sons Heinrich and Otto and his daughter Huberta.
