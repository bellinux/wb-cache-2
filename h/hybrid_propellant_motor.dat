Amateur rocketeers have been responsible for significant research into hybrid rocket motors, and have built and flown a variety of solid, liquid, and <b>hybrid</b> <b>propellant</b> <b>motors.</b> On May 17, 2004 Civilian Space eXploration Team (CSXT) successfully launched the first amateur high-power rocket into space, achieving an altitude of 72 miles (115 km). Prior to that the Reaction Research Society on November 23, 1996 launched a solid-fueled rocket, designed by longtime member George Garboden, to an altitude of 50 miles (80 km) from the Black Rock Desert in Nevada.|$|R
40|$|The {{addition}} of nanosized metal particles in propulsion {{systems such as}} solid and liquid <b>propellants,</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>propellant</b> and ramjet <b>motors</b> has recently became {{a major focus of}} research. Significant increases in the burning velocity and in the specific impulse are some of the advantages of using nano-scale energetic materials in many different types of propulsion systems. Aluminum has been largely employed as a metallic additive in energetic materials, also in a recently new propulsion system (aluminum/ice propulsion, “Alice”), and some studies show that the advantages of using nanosized aluminum instead of microsized aluminum are facilitating the ignition of the systems and allowing better incorporation of the components in the formulations and improving its homogeneity. Some of the combustion processes that require high pressures and even higher temperatures can occur in moderate conditions due to the increase of the surface area of the reactants, in this case, the metallic additive...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{a liquid}} oxidizer-solid fuel <b>hybrid</b> <b>propellant</b> {{combination}} in booster rocket motors appears extremely attractive due to {{the integration of the}} best features of liquid and solid propulsion systems. The hybrid rocket combines the high performance, clean exhaust, and safety of liquid propellant engines with the low cost and simplicity of solid <b>propellant</b> <b>motors.</b> Additionally, the <b>hybrid</b> rocket has unique advantages such as an inert fuel grain and a relative insensitivity to fuel grain and oxidizer injection anomalies. The advantages mark the hybrid rocket as a potential replacement or alternative for current and future solid propellant booster systems. The issues are addressed and recommendations are made concerning oxidizer feed systems, injectors, and ignition systems as related to hybrid rocket propulsion. Early in the program a baseline hybrid configuration was established in which liquid oxygen would be injected through ports in a solid fuel whose composition is based on hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB). Liquid oxygen remained the recommended oxidizer and thus all of the injector concepts which were evaluated assumed only liquid would be used as the oxidizer...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{combustion}} experiments {{have been conducted}} for investigating the regression rates of mixed <b>hybrid</b> <b>propellants</b> using Red Fuming Nitrous Acid (RFNA) as liquid oxidizer and Hydroxyl-Terminated Polybutadiene (HTPB) {{with the addition of}} Ammonium Perchlorate (AP) upto 20 percent as the solid fuel. HTPB is the state-of-the-art binder used in solid <b>propellant</b> rocket <b>motors</b> and {{is considered to be a}} potential candidate fuel for hybrid rocket applications due to its higher regression rate characteristics, greater fuel value, higher carbon/hydrogen ratio and solid loading capability. One of the effective ways of increasing the regression rates in hybrids is the addition of solid oxidizer such as AP in the fuel in small percentages. This type of configuration is called “mixed hybrid ” and regression rate enhancement upto 100 % is obtained. A series of static tests are conducted to establish the ignition and combustion in the hybrid mode. It is seen that the <b>hybrid</b> <b>propellant</b> has burnt smoothly. The ignition pressure could also be controlled and kept to a reasonable value. Stable combustion within a variation of chamber pressure ± 2 % and combustion efficiency above 0. 95 was achieved. The characteristics of the combustion products are calculated using the NASA CEA code. Regression rate correlations for the different combinations are obtaine...|$|R

40|$|A novel, reusable, Vertical-Takeoff-and-Vertical-Takeoff-and-Landing, Single-Stage-to-Orbit (VTOL/SSTO) launch system concept, named AUGMENT-SSTO, is {{presented}} in this paper to help quantify the advantages of employing gelled and <b>hybrid</b> <b>propellant</b> propulsion system options for such applications. The launch vehicle system concept considered uses a highly coupled, main high performance liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen (LO 2 /LH 2) propulsion system, that is used only for launch, while a gelled or <b>hybrid</b> <b>propellant</b> propulsion system auxiliary propulsion system is used during final orbit insertion, major orbit maneuvering, and landing propulsive burn phases of flight. Using a gelled or <b>hybrid</b> <b>propellant</b> propulsion system for major orbit maneuver burns and landing has many advantages over conventional VTOL/SSTO concepts that use LO 2 /LH 2 propulsion system(s) burns for all phases of flight. The applicability of three gelled propellant systems, O 2 /H 2 /Al, O 2 /RP- 1 /Al, and NTO/MMH/Al, and a state-of-the-art (SOA) hybrid propulsion system are examined in this study. Additionally, this paper addresses the applicability of a high performance gelled O 2 /H 2 propulsion system to perform the primary, as well as the auxiliary propulsion system functions of the vehicle...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{investigation}} on solid <b>propellant</b> <b>motors</b> with a stress reliever are presented. The thermal stress and strain of solid <b>propellant</b> <b>motors</b> during service life were analyzed by means of MSC/NASTRAN using eight-node HEXA solid elements. Three design cases of a stress reliever were considered to study its e¤ects on the reduction of thermal response. On the other hand, two additional design cases, with an alternative free-ßap design or without any thermal stress relief design, were also analyzed for comparison. VeriÞcation of the analysis results was accomplished by applying the nondestructive test (NDT) after three cycles of thermal loading. Good correlation existed between the computational and experimental results when the corresponding failure location and failure mode of the solid propellant were compared. Two important design criteria are established. One is the minimum outer diameter of the stress reliever, which dominates the hoop stress.
