5|$|A {{total of}} six German surface raiders, four Japanese {{aircraft}} carriers, seven Japanese cruisers, nine Japanese destroyers and twenty eight Japanese and German submarines operated in Australian waters between 1940 and 1945. These 54 warships sank 53 merchant ships and three warships within the Australia Station, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of over 1,751 Allied military personnel, sailors and civilians. Over 88 people were also killed by IJN air attacks on towns in northern Australia. In exchange, the Allies sank one German surface raider, one full-sized Japanese submarine and two midget submarines within Australian waters, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of 157 Axis sailors. A further two German submarines were sunk while en route to Australian waters {{with the loss of}} 81 sailors.|$|E
5|$|Also in the 1880s, Jifna was {{frequently}} taxed by Ottoman authorities. It also came into consistent armed conflict with another Christian village, Bir Zeit, which in one incident, resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of five men from that village. In retaliation, residents of Bir Zeit uprooted and burned 125 of Jifna's olive groves.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Clemmons' {{murder of}} four police {{officers}} represented {{the largest number}} of law enforcement officers killed by a lone perpetrator in a single incident in U.S. history.

5|$|Following the Mexican Revolution, the new {{government}} began persecuting the Church. To destroy the Church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics that resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of thousands, including several priests who were also knights of Columbus. Known as the Mexican martyrs, these men have been canonized.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether {{the increase of}} apo-ptosis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> placenta is associated with intrauterine fetal death in prostaglandin F receptor-deficient mice. Apoptosis was dem-onstrated within placental and decidual tissue by the TUNEL method. The majority of apoptosis was found in syncytiotropho-blast tissues. Enhanced TUNEL-positive staining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> syncytio-trophoblast layer was scattered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> placental tissues <b>in</b> clus-ters of apoptotic cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> group. Marked TUNEL-posi-tive cells were identified in decidua of both groups. The rate of apoptosis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> placenta and decidua <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> group was higher than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> survival group (P, 0. 05). Immunohis-tochemical analysis showed {{that the level of}} active caspase- 3 protein expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> placenta <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> group was much higher than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> survival group. The level of Bcl- 2 protein expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> placenta <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> group was much lower than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> survival group. Western blot analysis demon-strated that increased expression of the active form of caspase- 3 was detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> placenta and decidua <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> group compared with that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> survival group. <b>In</b> contrast, a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> expression of Bcl- 2 was detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> placenta and de-cidua <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> group compared with that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> survival group. Enhanced expression of Bax:Bcl- 2 ratio was detected in placenta and decidua <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> group compared with that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> survival group. Thus, significantly increased apoptosis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouse placenta and decidua might be involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> patho-physiologic mechanism of intrauterine fetal death. apoptosis, placenta, pregnancy, trophoblas...|$|R
30|$|We {{included}} 25 {{teams for}} a total of 129 participants. We analysed 63 participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> group and 57 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> life group. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups, including baseline anxiety (STAI-state score 39.6 (7.8) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> group vs 38.6 (7.1) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> life group). We report a significant reduction in both groups 1  month after the training: 6.6 (7.8) vs 6 (8.0), mean difference 0.5 (− 2.4; 3.4). At 3  months, we report a significant greater reduction of anxiety <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> group (mean difference 4 [0.1; 7.9]).|$|R

5|$|On December 29, 1890, the Wounded Knee Massacre {{occurred}} on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{associated}} convective activity was east {{of the center of}} circulation, Louisiana and Mississippi received minimal damage.

The heavy rainfall progressed into Georgia, where significant flooding occurred. Crop damage was extensive, and about 335 structures were damaged by the flooding.

Dangić was then seized and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in German-occupied Poland, being replaced by Stevan Botić as the Chetnik commander in eastern Bosnia. Dangić escaped from prison in 1943.
