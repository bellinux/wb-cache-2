5|$|Assuming {{that the}} <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle</b> holds, gravity {{influences}} {{the passage of}} time. Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent {{in the opposite direction}} (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.|$|E
5|$|As it is {{constructed}} using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take {{on the same}} form in all coordinate systems. Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity, namely that {{the laws of physics}} are the same for all observers. Locally, as expressed in the <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle,</b> spacetime is Minkowskian, and the laws of physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{formulations}} of <b>equivalence</b> <b>principles</b> provide {{the foundation for}} an efficient approach to understanding and organizing the structural features of gravitation field theories. Since theories' predictions reflect differences in their structures, <b>principles</b> of <b>equivalence</b> also support an efficient experimental strategy for testing gravitation theories and for exploring the range of conceivable gravitation physics. These principles focus attention squarely on empirical consequences of the fundamental structural differences that distinguish one gravitation theory from another.

5|$|Gravitational {{redshift}} {{has been}} {{measured in the}} laboratory and using astronomical observations. Gravitational time dilation in the Earth's gravitational field has been measured numerous times using atomic clocks, while ongoing validation is provided as {{a side effect of}} the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Tests in stronger gravitational fields are provided by the observation of binary pulsars. All results are in agreement with general relativity. However, at the current level of accuracy, these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle</b> is valid.|$|E
5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local frames in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle,</b> a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E
5|$|The same {{experimental}} data shows that time {{as measured by}} clocks in a gravitational field—proper time, to give the technical term—does not follow the rules of special relativity. In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the Minkowski metric. As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry. At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian. Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space. The metric tensor that defines the geometry—in particular, how lengths and angles are measured—is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or pseudo-Riemannian metric. Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the Levi-Civita connection, and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle</b> and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable locally inertial coordinates, the metric is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).|$|E

5|$|Conversely, {{one might}} expect that {{inertial}} motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), {{can be used to}} define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle,</b> or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties. A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.|$|E
25|$|Schiff's {{conjecture}} {{suggests that}} the weak <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle</b> implies the Einstein <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle,</b> {{but it has not}} been proven. Nonetheless, the two principles are tested with very different kinds of experiments. The Einstein <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle</b> has been criticized as imprecise, because there is no universally accepted way to distinguish gravitational from non-gravitational experiments (see for instance Hadley and Durand).|$|E
25|$|One {{challenge}} to the <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle</b> is the Brans–Dicke theory. Self-creation cosmology is a modification of the Brans–Dicke theory.

The Rule Interchange Format (RIF) is a new W 3 C recommendation standard for exchanging rules among disparate systems. Yet, the impact that the introduction of RIF has on the design of flexible business processes is unclear. Intelligent software agents can be used to create dynamic business processes. The BDI architectural style is regarded as the predominant approach for the implementation of intelligent agents. It is expected that using RIF can enhance the reasoning capability of agents. Yet, these two developments are not connected. In this research, an approach is developed for integrating RIF and BDI agents.

25|$|Since Einstein {{developed}} general relativity, {{there was}} a need to develop a framework to test the theory against other possible theories of gravity compatible with special relativity. This was developed by Robert Dicke as part of his program to test general relativity. Two new principles were suggested, the so-called Einstein <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle</b> and the strong <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle,</b> each of which assumes the weak <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle</b> as a starting point. They only differ in whether or not they apply to gravitational experiments.|$|E
25|$|Another part of {{the strong}} <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle</b> is the {{requirement}} that Newton's gravitational constant be constant in time, and have the same value everywhere in the universe.

25|$|This is {{the only}} form of the <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle</b> that applies to self-gravitating objects (such as stars), which have {{substantial}} internal gravitational interactions. It requires that the gravitational constant be the same everywhere in the universe and is incompatible with a fifth force. It is much more restrictive than the Einstein <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle.</b>|$|E
25|$|Proposals {{that may}} lead to a quantum theory of gravity such as string theory and loop quantum gravity predict {{violations}} of the weak <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle</b> because they contain many light scalar fields with long Compton wavelengths, which should generate fifth forces and variation of the fundamental constants. Heuristic arguments suggest that the magnitude of these <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle</b> violations could be in the 10−13 to 10−18 range. Currently envisioned tests of the weak <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle</b> are approaching a degree of sensitivity such that non-discovery of a violation would be just as profound a result as discovery of a violation. Non-discovery of <b>equivalence</b> <b>principle</b> violation in this range would suggest that gravity is so fundamentally different from other forces as to require a major reevaluation of current attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of nature. A positive detection, on the other hand, would provide a major guidepost towards unification.|$|E

40|$|We review {{highlights}} from string theory, black hole physics and doubly special relativity and some "thought" experiments which were suggested {{to probe the}} shortest distance and/or the maximum momentum at the Planck scale. The models which are designed to implement the minimal length scale and/or the maximum momentum in different physical systems are analysed entered the literature as the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We compare between them. The existence of a minimal length and a maximum momentum accuracy is preferred by various physical observations. Furthermore, assuming modified dispersion relation allows {{for a wide range}} of applications in estimating, for example, the inflationary parameters, Lorentz invariance violation, black hole thermodynamics, Saleker-Wigner inequalities, entropic nature of the gravitational laws, Friedmann equations, minimal time measurement and thermodynamics of the high-energy collisions. One of the higher-order GUP approaches gives predictions for the minimal length uncertainty. Another one predicts a maximum momentum and a minimal length uncertainty, simultaneously. An extensive comparison between the different GUP approaches is summarized. We also discuss the GUP impacts on the <b>equivalence</b> <b>principles</b> including the universality of the gravitational redshift and the free fall and law of reciprocal action and on the kinetic energy of composite system. The concern about the compatibility with the <b>equivalence</b> <b>principles,</b> the universality of gravitational redshift and the free fall and law of reciprocal action should be addressed.
