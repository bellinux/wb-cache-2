40|$|A clinicopathological {{study using}} autopsy {{materials}} {{to find out}} the correlation between histological findings of cirrhosis of the liver (LC) with or without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and morphological evidences of portal hypertension such as <b>esophageal</b> <b>varix</b> formation and splenomegaly. In all 79 cases of LC (accompanied with or without HCC) and HCC (with no LC) out of 1, 112 autopsy cases at the Department of Pathology, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University during the period 1967 to 1989 were reviewed. All patients were from Nagasaki City and its suburbs. Histologically, the LC cases were divided into three types; Nagayo's A-type (Nagayo, 1914) which showed wide fibrous septum, Nagayo's B-type which showed thin fibrous septum and macronodular pseudolobule, and micronodular type which showed micronodular pseudolobule with fatty metamorphosis and thin fibrous septum. Five out of six cases (83 %) of A-type LC were complicated with <b>esophageal</b> <b>varix</b> and four out of the five cases (80 %) showed rupture of varix. Five out of eight cases (63 %) of B-type LC were complicated with <b>esophageal</b> <b>varix</b> and two out of the five cases (40 %) showed rupture of varix. Two out of five cases (40 %) of micronodular type LC were complicated with ruptured esophageal varices and the remaining three cases had no varix. All 16 cases (100 %) of A-type LC accompanied with HCC were complicated with esophageal varices. Ten cases (63 %) of them showed rupture of varix. On the other hand 23 out of all 31 cases (74 %) of B-type LC accompanied with HCC showed esophageal varices. However, only eight (35 %) of the varix cases showed rupture of varices. As for HCC without LC, five out of all 13 cases (38 %) were complicated with esophageal varices showing no ruptrue. These findings suggest that advanced and thick fibrosis of the liver in the LC cases with architectural distortion of the intrahepatic portal veins and the disturbance of blood flows {{is one of the most}} important factors which play an etiological role of portal hypertension followed by <b>esophageal</b> <b>varix</b> formation and splenomegaly. More advanced splenomegaly (mean weight, 470 g) and <b>esophageal</b> <b>varix</b> formation may be caused by more severe portal hypertension in A-type LC which shows wide fibrous septa than other types of LC. HCC may play an etiological role of portal hypertension, especially in the cases of occurrence of intrahepatic portal invasion of tumor tissue, but less remarkably than LC cases...|$|E
40|$|We report herein {{a case of}} 35 -years-old {{woman in}} whom portal {{hypertension}} (<b>esophageal</b> <b>varix</b> and splenomegaly) developed after 12 cycles of oxaliplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy for rectal cancer. She was transferred {{for the evaluation of}} etiology of new-onset portal hypertension. The <b>esophageal</b> <b>varix</b> and splenomegaly were absent before the oxaliplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy. Thorough history taking and serological exam revealed no evidence of chronic liver disease. Liver biopsy was done and there was no cirrhotic nodule formation. Instead, perivenular fibrosis was noted. Considering new development of esophageal varices and splenomegaly after 12 cycles of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy, we could conclude that portal hypertension in this patient were due to sinusoidal injury by oxaliplatin. Finally, we recommend regular follow-up with endoscopy and radiologic examination for checking the development of varices and for screening of varices and splenomegaly in patients with colo-rectal cancer who receive oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.

40|$|International audienceAcute variceal hemorrhage, a {{life-threatening}} condition {{that requires a}} multidisciplinary approach for effective therapy, is defined as visible bleeding from an <b>esophageal</b> or gastric <b>varix</b> {{at the time of}} endoscopy, the presence of large esophageal varices with recent stigmata of bleeding, or fresh blood visible in the stomach with no other source of bleeding identified. Transfusion of blood products, pharmacological treatments and early endoscopic therapy are often effective; however, if primary hemostasis cannot be obtained or if uncontrollable early rebleeding occurs, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is recommended as rescue treatment. The TIPS represents a major advance in the treatment of complications of portal hypertension. Acute variceal hemorrhage that is poorly controlled with endoscopic therapy is generally well controlled with TIPS, which has a 90 % to 100 % success rate. However, TIPS is associated with a mortality of 30 % to 50 % in such a setting. Emergency TIPS should be considered early in patients with refractory variceal bleeding once medical treatment and endoscopic sclerotherapy failure, before the clinical condition worsens. Furthermore, admission to specialized centers is mandatory in such a setting and regional protocols are essential to be organized effectively. This review article discusses initial management and then focuses on the specific role of TIPS as a primary therapy to control acute variceal hemorrhage, particularly as a rescue therapy following failure of endoscopic approaches...|$|R

40|$|Eighteen cirrhotic {{patients}} with esophageal varices {{at risk for}} bleeding {{took part in a}} double-blind study. The variations in PFV induced by either 40 mg of propranolol or 60 mg of sustained-release isosorbide- 5 -mononitrate on two consecutive days were evaluated with a duplex Doppler device. Both drugs caused a significant decrease in maximum (propranolol, P = 0. 002; isosorbide- 5 -mononitrate, P = 0. 021). Four patients responded to propranolol, three to isosorbide- 5 -mononitrate, and eight to both drugs; three did not show any change.

30|$|PV {{cavernous}} {{transformation is}} the angiographic appearance of numerous collateral vessels around the PV owing to various reasons. These {{are classified as}} idiopathic causes (e.g., congenital malformation, or following hepatobiliary surgery) or secondary causes (e.g., liver cirrhosis, thrombosis, tumor) [10]. In this case, there were no hepatofugal collateral pathways caused by splenomegaly, a gastric or <b>esophageal</b> <b>varix,</b> or any hepatopetal collateral pathways. Furthermore, intraoperative findings suggested that the cavernous transformation was due to a congenital etiology, as the obstruction site was distant from the tumor and was soft under palpation. Unfortunately there is no previous CT or portography, however, it is speculated that the etiology of congenital PV cavernous transformation may result from portal vein malformation, or portal thrombosis for omphalitis or pylephlebitis.|$|E
40|$|Transnasal {{esophagogastroduodenoscopy}} (TN-EGD) {{has recently}} {{become one of}} the frequently used methods of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in some countries. Changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation are smaller for TN-EGD than for conventional transoral esophagogastroduodenoscopy, making it a safer procedure. Lower pain and gag reflex enable TN-EGD to be performed without conscious sedation. TN-EGD is applied in various gastrointestinal (GI) procedures such as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, nasoenteric feeding tube placement, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography with nasobiliary drainage and lithotripsy, long intestinal tube placement in small-bowel obstruction, esophageal manometry, foreign body removal, botulinum toxin injection for achalasia, <b>esophageal</b> <b>varix</b> evaluation with the aid of endoscopic ultrasonography, and the double-scope technique for endoscopic submucosal dissection. The establishment of standard training programs and nationwide guidelines, the dissemination of educational information, the improvement in endoscopy devices and accessories, and the availability of insurance coverage for the procedure will obviously further widen the adoption of TN-EGD...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} case of an 11 -year-old female patient {{diagnosed}} with Caroli syndrome, who had refractory esophageal varices. The patient had a history of recurrent bleeding from <b>esophageal</b> <b>varix,</b> which was treated with endoscopic variceal ligation three times over two years. However, the varices were not controlled. When the patient finally visited the emergency room, hemoglobin level was 4. 4 g&# 47;dL. Transhepatic intrajugular portosystemic shunt was unsuccessful. Subsequently, the patient underwent percutaneous transhepatic variceal obliteration. Twenty hours after percutaneous transhepatic variceal obliteration, the patient complained of aphasia, dizziness, headache and general weakness. Six hours later, the patient became drowsy and unresponsive to painful stimuli. Lipiodol particles used to embolize the coronary and posterior gastric veins might pass into the systemic arterial circulation and were found to be lodged in the brain, kidney, lung and stomach. There was no abnormality of the portal vein on portal venography and blood flow to azygos vein through paravertebral and the hemiazygous system drained to systemic circulation on coronary venogram. Contrast echocardiography showed no pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. Symptoms improved with conservative management and esophageal varices improved on esophagogastroduodenoscopy...|$|E
40|$|A new {{detachable}} snare for hemostasis in {{the removal}} of large polyps or other elevated lesion {{was developed by the}} author (Olympus Ligating Device). It allows ligation to be performed through the channel of an endoscope using a nonconductive loop that can be detached from the ligator. At Sakura National Hospital, endoscopic ligation with this device was performed in 80 patients from May 1989 to January 1994. The purpose of the procedure was preventive hemostasis prior to the endoscopic resection of large elevated lesions in 71 patients and for control of hemorrhage in 9 patients. The elevated lesions were polyps in 69 patients and submucosal tumor in 2, being pedunculated in 36 and semipedunculated in 35. The maximum diameter of these lesions ranged from 15 to 40 mm (mean: 23 mm), being greater than 20 mm in 57 cases. The 9 patients undergoing endoscopic ligation for hemorrhage had bleeding polypectomy stumps (n = 5), bleeding polyps (n = 3), and a bleeding <b>esophageal</b> <b>varix</b> (n = 1). Endoscopic ligation achieved the complete prevention of hemorrhage following the resection of elevated lesion in 63 / 71 patients (88. 7 %) and, in combination with a HX- 3 L clip, allowed endoscopic resection to be performed in 70 / 71 patients (98. 6 %). In the 9 patients with bleeding lesions, complete hemostasis was achieved without complications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{case report}} {{concerns}} a 40 -year-old male {{who had previously}} been treated for an <b>esophageal</b> <b>varix</b> rupture, {{at the age of}} 30 years. The medical examination at that time revealed occlusion of the inferior vena cava in the proximity of the liver, leading to the diagnosis of the patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome. The progress of the patient was therefore monitored in an outpatient clinic. The patient had no history of drinking or smoking, but had suffered an epileptic seizure in 2004. The patient's family history revealed nothing of note. In February 2012, color Doppler ultrasonography (US) revealed a change in the blood flow in the right portal vein branch, from hepatopetal to hepatofugal, during deep inspiration. Arrival time parametric imaging (At-PI), using Sonazoid-enhanced US, was subsequently performed to examine the deep respiration-induced changes observed in the hepatic parenchymal perfusion. US images captured during deep inspiration demonstrated hepatic parenchymal perfusion predominantly in red, indicating that the major blood supply was the hepatic artery. During deep expiration, the portal venous blood flow remained hepatopetal, and hepatic parenchymal perfusion was displayed predominantly in yellow, indicating that the portal vein was the major source of the blood flow. The original diagnostic imaging results were reproduced one month subsequently by an identical procedure. At-PI enabled an investigation into the changes that were induced in the hepatic parenchymal perfusion by a compensatory mechanism involving the hepatic artery. These changes occurred in response to a reduction in the portal venous blood flow, as is observed in the arterialization of hepatic blood flow that is correlated with the progression of chronic hepatitis C. It has been established that the peribil-iary capillary plexus is important in the regulation of hepatic arterial blood flow. However, this case demonstrated that the peribiliary capillary plexus also regulates acute changes in portal venous blood flow, in addition to the chronic reduc-tion in blood flow that is observed in patients with chronic hepatitis C...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively use transesophageal {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) imaging {{to determine the}} morphologic and hemodynamic characteristics of esophageal varices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study {{was approved by the}} ethics committee. All patients gave written informed consent. Forty-two patients (29 men, 13 women; mean age, 58 years +/- 11 [standard deviation]) with esophageal varices that were recently demonstrated at endoscopy were included in the study. MR imaging was performed by using a receiver probe that was placed in the esophagus. Black-blood T 2 -weighted MR images were obtained with cardiac triggering and navigator gating of the right hemidiaphragm. On these images, the maximal diameter, minimal diameter, and surface area of the largest <b>esophageal</b> <b>varix</b> were measured. Periesophageal and paraesophageal varices were recorded. A hemodynamic examination was performed in the last 21 patients to undergo MR imaging, which was used to obtain measurements of flow velocity and rate before and after intravenous injection of 50 mug of octreotide or a placebo. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess differences in the diameter and surface area of the varices according to endoscopic grade. Hemodynamic changes observed after octreotide or placebo injection were compared by using an analysis of variance and a 95 % confidence interval. RESULTS: Periesophageal varices were observed in 36 patients, and paraesophageal varices were observed in 32 patients. The minimal diameter, maximal diameter, and surface area of the esophageal varices at MR imaging differed significantly according to endoscopic grade (P <. 001). In the periesophageal varices, the velocity and flow changes caused by octreotide differed significantly from those caused by the placebo (P <. 001). A decrease in velocity (mean velocity change, - 2. 766 cm. sec(- 1)) and flow (mean flow change, - 0. 455 mL. sec(- 1)) was noted after octreotide injection, but no significant change in velocity (mean velocity change, 0. 252 cm. sec(- 1)) or flow (mean flow change, 0. 018 mL. sec(- 1)) was noted after placebo injection. The surface area of the varices did not change significantly after octreotide (mean change, - 0. 771 mm 2) or placebo (mean change, - 0. 015 mm 2) injection. CONCLUSION: Transesophageal MR imaging is a feasible method to assess the morphologic and hemodynamic characteristics of esophageal varices before and after pharmacologic treatment...|$|E
40|$|Background: Bleeding from esophageal varices {{is a life}} {{threatening}} situation for a patient with portal hypertension. Esophageal varices are dilated veins in the submucosal layer of the esophagus. The dilatation of submucosal veins is the consequence of elevated pressure in the portal vein. Portal hypertension mostly stems from liver cirrhosis. The mortality rate of patients with bleeding esophageal varices is high. Therefore, primary-prevention of the first episode of bleeding is very important. Patients with a bleeding esophageal varice must be admitted to hospital. It {{is very important that}} loss in blood volume is substituted with IV infusions even before the admission to hospital. If the patient is bleeding from {{the upper part of the}} gastrointestinal tract and has clinical signs of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension due to the larger probability that the source of the bleeding is the <b>esophageal</b> <b>varix,</b> then even before admission to hospital one can start with IV application of medications for lowering portal vein pressure. This may diminish or even stop the bleeding. After admission an urgent diagnostic esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy should be done as soon as possible in order to determine the source of bleeding. If it is possible, the bleeding should be stopped with endoscopic therapy. After successful endoscopic therapy we continue with the substitution of the loss in blood volume with IV infusion and transfusion and also with IV applications of the medications for lowering portal vein pressure in order to prevent an early re-occurence in bleeding. In cases where the bleeding cannot be stopped with endoscopic therapy, the patient needs urgent Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt placement or urgent surgical shunt formation. While organizing the above mentioned procedures, we can try to stop the bleeding using a balloon tamponade and IV application of medications for lowering portal vein pressure. After the first bleeding from esophageal varices the patient needs secondary-prevention in order to prevent repeated episodes of variceal hemorrhage. Conclusions: Esophageal varice hemorrhaging worsens the prognosis of the patient with portal hypertension. Primaryprevention of the initial variceal hemorrhage, good selection and application of the right therapy on-time when the varice is bleeding and secondary-prevention of repeated episodes of variceal hemorrhage can improve the prognosis of patients with portal hypertension. </p...|$|E
