5|$|Oral hygiene is the {{practice}} of keeping the mouth clean and {{is a means of}} preventing dental caries, <b>gingivitis,</b> periodontal disease, bad breath, and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.|$|E
5|$|Plaque is a biofilm {{consisting}} of {{large quantities of}} various bacteria that form on teeth. If not removed regularly, plaque buildup can lead to periodontal problems such as <b>gingivitis.</b> Given time, plaque can mineralize along the gingiva, forming tartar. The microorganisms that form the biofilm are almost entirely bacteria (mainly streptococcus and anaerobes), with the composition varying by location in the mouth. Streptococcus mutans {{is the most important}} bacterium associated with dental caries.|$|E
25|$|While {{some cases}} of <b>gingivitis</b> never {{progress}} to periodontitis, data indicates that periodontitis is always preceded by <b>gingivitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Gingivitis</b> is a {{non-destructive}} {{disease that}} occurs around the teeth. The {{most common form}} of <b>gingivitis,</b> and the {{most common form of}} periodontal disease overall, is in response to bacterial biofilms (also called plaque) that is attached to tooth surfaces, termed plaque-induced <b>gingivitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Gingivitis</b> can be {{prevented}} through regular oral hygiene that includes daily brushing and flossing. Hydrogen peroxide, saline, alcohol or chlorhexidine mouth washes may also be employed. In a 2004 clinical study, the beneficial effect of hydrogen peroxide on <b>gingivitis</b> has been highlighted.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{toothbrushes}} were developed, {{and initially}} recommended {{for people with}} strength or dexterity problems in their hands, but they have come into widespread general use. The effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and <b>gingivitis</b> is superior for reducing plaque and <b>gingivitis</b> to that of conventional manual toothbrushes.|$|E
25|$|Triclosan, an {{antibacterial}} agent, is {{a common}} toothpaste ingredient in the United Kingdom. Triclosan or zinc chloride prevent <b>gingivitis</b> and, according to the American Dental Association, helps reduce tartar and bad breath. A 2006 review of clinical research concluded there was evidence for the effectiveness of 0.30% triclosan in reducing plaque and <b>gingivitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Colgate-Palmolive found a {{significant}} reduction in <b>gingivitis,</b> bleeding, and plaque with the use of triclosan-containing toothpaste, but an independent review of the Cochrane group suggests that while the reduction in <b>gingivitis,</b> bleeding, and plaque may be statistically significant, it may not be beneficial enough to yield clinical significance.|$|E
25|$|Atrophic, {{appearing}} as areas. Atrophic oral lichen planus may also manifest as desquamative <b>gingivitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Gingivitis</b> is a {{category}} of periodontal disease {{in which there is}} no loss of bone but inflammation and bleeding are present.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus of}} {{treatment}} {{is to remove}} plaque. Therapy is aimed at the reduction of oral bacteria and may {{take the form of}} regular periodic visits to a dental professional together with adequate oral hygiene home care. Thus, several of the methods used in the prevention of <b>gingivitis</b> can also be used for the treatment of manifest <b>gingivitis,</b> such as scaling, root planing, curettage, mouth washes containing chlorhexidine or hydrogen peroxide, and flossing. Interdental brushes also help remove any causative agents.|$|E
25|$|Using an {{antiseptic}} mouthwash: Chlorhexidine gluconate-based mouthwash {{in combination}} with careful oral hygiene may cure <b>gingivitis,</b> although they cannot reverse any attachment loss due to periodontitis.|$|E
25|$|If <b>gingivitis</b> is not {{responsive}} to treatment, referral to a periodontist (a specialist in {{diseases of the}} gingiva and bone around teeth and dental implants) for further treatment may be necessary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gingivitis</b> and gingival {{enlargement}} {{are often}} seen in mouth breathers, {{as a result of}} irritation brought on by surface dehydration, but {{the manner in which it}} is caused has not been demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|Saliva {{contributes}} to the digestion of food and {{to the maintenance of}} oral hygiene. Without normal salivary function the frequency of dental caries, gum disease (<b>gingivitis</b> and periodontitis), and other oral problems increases significantly.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacteria}} that causes <b>gingivitis</b> {{can be controlled}} by using an oral irrigator daily with a mouthwash containing an antibiotic. Either amoxicillin, cephalexin, or minocycline in 16 ounces of a non-alcoholic fluoride mouthwash is an effective mixture.|$|E
25|$|Overly {{vigorous}} or incorrectly performed brushing or flossing {{may cause}} {{injury to the}} gingiva (gums). Improper or over-vigorous brushing may cause sore gums, damage to tooth enamel, <b>gingivitis,</b> and bleeding gums. Dentists and dental hygienists can instruct and demonstrate proper brushing or flossing techniques.|$|E
25|$|A dental {{hygienist}} or dentist will {{check for the}} symptoms of <b>gingivitis,</b> and may also examine the amount of plaque in the oral cavity. A {{dental hygienist}} or dentist will also look for signs of periodontitis using X-rays or periodontal probing {{as well as other}} methods.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} shows that activity levels of the following enzymes in saliva samples are associated with periodontal destruction: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and acid phosphatase (ACP). Therefore, these enzyme biomarkers {{may be used to}} aid in the diagnosis and treatment of <b>gingivitis</b> and periodontitis.|$|E
25|$|In daily life, trace {{amounts of}} {{pyridine}} are {{components of the}} volatile organic compounds that are produced in roasting and canning processes, e.g. in fried chicken, sukiyaki, roasted coffee, potato chips, and fried bacon. Traces of pyridine {{can be found in}} Beaufort cheese, vaginal secretions, black tea, saliva of those suffering from <b>gingivitis,</b> and sunflower honey.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{intensive}} {{oral hygiene}} care {{has been shown}} to improve gingival health in individuals with well-controlled type 2 diabetes. Periodontal destruction is also slowed down due to the extensive oral care. Intensive oral hygiene care (oral health education plus supra-gingival scaling) without any periodontal therapy improves gingival health, and may prevent progression of <b>gingivitis</b> in well-controlled diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Other {{possible}} {{risk factors}} include periodontal disease, acute necrotizing ulcerative <b>gingivitis,</b> local bone disease, Paget's disease of bone, osteopetrosis, cemento-osseous dysplasia, {{a history of}} previously developing a dry socket with past extractions and inadequate oral hygiene. Other factors in the postoperative period {{that may lead to}} loss of the blood clot include forceful spitting, sucking through a straw, and coughing or sneezing.|$|E
25|$|Dental {{disease is}} very common in dogs. Calculus is the most obvious sign of dental disease, but <b>gingivitis</b> {{progressing}} to periodontitis is what results in tooth loss. Treatment involves scaling and polishing of the teeth under general anesthesia and treatment of any periodontal disease. Prevention is very important and can be accomplished {{through the use of}} special diets or treats, brushing, and plaque prevention gels.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{behavior}} in dogs, separation anxiety, aggression, escape behavior and inappropriate elimination are reduced while noise phobia and sexual behavior was increased. In males with aggression issues, earlier neutering may increase barking. In cats, asthma, <b>gingivitis,</b> and hyperactivity were decreased, while shyness was increased. In male cats, occurrence of abscesses, aggression toward veterinarians, sexual behaviors, and urine spraying was decreased, while hiding was increased.|$|E
25|$|Rigorous plaque control {{programs}} {{along with}} periodontal scaling and curettage also {{have proved to}} be helpful, although according to the American Dental Association, periodontal scaling and root planing are considered as a treatment for periodontal disease, not as a preventive treatment for periodontal disease. In a 1997 review of effectiveness data, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found clear evidence showing that toothpaste containing triclosan was effective in preventing <b>gingivitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some people, <b>gingivitis</b> {{progresses}} to periodontitis â€“ {{with the}} destruction of the gingival fibers, the gum tissues separate from the tooth and deepened sulcus, called a periodontal pocket. Subgingival microorganisms (those that exist under the gum line) colonize the periodontal pockets and cause further inflammation in the gum tissues and progressive bone loss. Examples of secondary causes are those things that, by definition, cause microbic plaque accumulation, such as restoration overhangs and root proximity.|$|E
25|$|Gingival enlargement, (also termed gingival overgrowth, hypertrophic <b>gingivitis,</b> gingival hyperplasia, or gingival hypertrophy, and {{sometimes}} abbreviated to GO), {{is an increase}} {{in the size of the}} gingiva (gums). It is a common feature of gingival disease. Gingival enlargement can be caused by a number of factors, including inflammatory conditions and the side effects of certain medications. The treatment is based on the cause. A closely related term is epulis, denoting a localized tumor (i.e. lump) on the gingiva.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of toothpaste intended to be used on pets such as dogs and cats, and toothpaste used by astronauts, most toothpaste {{is not intended to}} be swallowed, and doing so may cause nausea or diarrhea. Tartar fighting toothpastes have been debated. Case reports of plasma cell <b>gingivitis</b> have been reported with the use of herbal toothpaste containing cinnamon. SLS has been proposed to increase the frequency of mouth ulcers in some people, as it can dry out the protective layer of oral tissues, causing the underlying tissues to become damaged.|$|E
25|$|Dry socket is {{more likely}} to occur where there is a {{pre-existing}} infection in the mouth, such as necrotizing ulcerative <b>gingivitis</b> or chronic periodontitis. Wisdom teeth not associated with pericoronitis are less likely to cause a dry socket when extracted. The oral microbiota has been demonstrated to have fibrinolytic action in some individuals, and these persons may be predisposed to developing dry sockets after tooth extraction. Infection of the socket following tooth extraction is different from dry socket, although in dry socket secondary infection may occur in addition.|$|E
25|$|Tin(II) fluoride, {{commonly}} referred to commercially as stannous fluoride (from Latin , 'tin') is a chemical compound with the formula SnF2. It is a colorless solid used as an ingredient in toothpastes that are typically more expensive than those that use sodium fluoride. Stannous fluoride converts the calcium mineral apatite into fluorapatite, which makes tooth enamel more resistant to bacteria-generated acid attacks. In toothpastes containing calcium minerals, sodium fluoride becomes ineffective over time, while stannous fluoride remains effective in strengthening tooth enamel. Stannous fluoride {{has been shown to}} be more effective than sodium fluoride in reducing the incidence of dental caries and controlling <b>gingivitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fluoride {{in various}} forms {{is the most popular}} active {{ingredient}} in toothpaste to prevent cavities. Fluoride occurs in small amounts in plants, animals, and some natural water sources. The additional fluoride in toothpaste has beneficial effects on the formation of dental enamel and bones. Sodium fluoride (NaF) is the most common source of fluoride, but stannous fluoride (SnF2), olaflur (an organic salt of fluoride), and sodium monofluorophosphate (Na2PO3F) are also used. Stannous fluoride {{has been shown to be}} more effective than sodium fluoride in reducing the incidence of dental caries and controlling <b>gingivitis,</b> but causes somewhat more surface stains.|$|E
25|$|As {{dental plaque}} or biofilm accumulates on the teeth near {{and below the}} gums, there is {{a shift in the}} {{composition}} of the biofilm from essentially streptococcus to an actinomyces dominant plaque. Motile bacteria is also seen more frequently. As this happens, inflammation sets in the gingiva. Initially, this takes the form of <b>gingivitis,</b> which represents inflammation confined to the soft tissues above the bone level. Inflammation in the gingiva can remain at the <b>gingivitis</b> level for a long period and will not progress to periodontitis, unless in the presence of local conditions or generalized host susceptibility. When this shift occurs, the immune system's response to plaque accumulation shifts from a predominantly neutrophilic mediated response to lymphocytic and plasma cell-mediated response. Clinically, the gingiva presents swelling, redness and a tendency to bleed. This modifies the environment, leading to changes in the composition of the biofilm itself. As this happens, a predominantly gram-negative environment is established, with periodontal pathogens emerging. These include A. actinomycetemcomitans, the red complex bacteria (P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola) {{and to a lesser extent}} the orange complex bacteria (F. nucleatum, P. micros, P. intermedia, P. nigrecens, E. nodatum and S. constellates). Strongest bacterial association to chronic periodontitis is with P. gingivalis. Numerous virulence factors have been identified for this pathogen. This allows P. gingivalis to elude defense mechanism and perpetuate inflammation inside the periodontium. Prolonged inflammation in the periodontium leads to an apical shift in the attachment of the gingiva to the tooth with deepening pockets and bone loss around the teeth. Untreated periodontitis progresses unevenly over time but results in loss of function, tissue destruction, and tooth loss.|$|E
25|$|Toothpaste is a paste or gel {{dentifrice}} {{used with}} a toothbrush as an accessory to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it serves as an abrasive that aids in removing the dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (<b>gingivitis).</b> Salt and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) are among materials that can be substituted for commercial toothpaste. Toothpaste {{is not intended to}} be swallowed due to the fluoride content, but is generally not very harmful if accidentally swallowed in small amounts; however, one should seek medical attention after swallowing abnormally large amounts.|$|E
25|$|In {{naturally}} dentate species, edentulism is {{more than}} just the simple presence or absence of teeth; it is biochemically complex, because the teeth, jaws, and oral mucosa are not static objects; they are dynamic (changing over time). Processes such as bone remodeling (loss and gain of bone tissue) in the jaws and inflammation of soft tissue in response to the oral microbiota are clinically important for edentulous people. For example, bone resorption in the jaw is frequently how the teeth were able to detach in the first place; the jaw in an edentulous area undergoes further resorption even after the teeth are gone; and insertion of dental implants can elicit new bone formation, leading to osseointegration. Meanwhile, bacteria and yeasts of the oral cavity and the immune system of their host create an immensely complicated and constantly changing interplay that presents clinically as <b>gingivitis,</b> caries, stomatitis, and other periodontal pathology.|$|E
25|$|The {{view that}} occlusal trauma (as may occur during bruxism) is a causative factor in <b>gingivitis</b> and {{periodontitis}} is not widely accepted. It {{is thought that}} the periodontal ligament may respond to increased occlusal (biting) forces by resorbing some of the bone of the alveolar crest, which may result in increased tooth mobility, however these changes are reversible if the occlusal force is reduced. Tooth movement that occurs during occlusal loading is sometimes termed fremitus. It is generally accepted that increased occlusal forces are able to increase the rate of progression of pre-existing periodontal disease (gum disease), however the main stay treatment is plaque control rather than elaborate occlusal adjustments. It is also generally accepted that periodontal disease {{is a far more}} common cause of tooth mobility and pathological tooth migration than any influence of bruxism, although bruxism may much less commonly be involved in both.|$|E
25|$|Biofilms {{have been}} found to be {{involved}} in a wide variety of microbial infections in the body, by one estimate 80% of all infections. Infectious processes in which biofilms have been implicated include common problems such as bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infections, catheter infections, middle-ear infections, formation of dental plaque, <b>gingivitis,</b> coating contact lenses, and less common but more lethal processes such as endocarditis, infections in cystic fibrosis, and infections of permanent indwelling devices such as joint prostheses, heart valves, and intervertebral disc. More recently it has been noted that bacterial biofilms may impair cutaneous wound healing and reduce topical antibacterial efficiency in healing or treating infected skin wounds. Early detection of biofilms in wounds is crucial to successful chronic wound management. Although many techniques have developed to identify planktonic bacteria in viable wounds, few have been able to quickly and accurately identify bacterial biofilms. Future studies are needed to find means of identifying and monitoring biofilm colonization at the bedside to permit timely initiation of treatment.|$|E
