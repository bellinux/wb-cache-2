5000|$|A patent {{was filed}} in 1962, and granted in 1962, for phenylalkane derivatives. In 1969 {{ibuprofen}} was licensed as {{a prescription drug}} in the UK, and in 1974 in the USA. It was launched in the USA in 1974 by Upjohn of Kalamazoo, Michigan as Motrin. In April 1966, <b>Ibufenac</b> (iso-butyl-phenyl-acetic-acid, known as Dytransin) went onto the UK market, but was withdrawn in January 1968 due to causing jaundice, from its toxicity in the liver. In 1970, Courtaulds Engineering built a £600,000 plant at Boots to make ibuprofen.|$|E
40|$|The {{disposition}} of ibuprofen and <b>ibufenac,</b> an analog of ibuprofen {{with a history}} of severe adverse reactions, was investigated in Rhesus monkeys after oral administration. Plasma concentrations of the parent drugs and their glucuronides were measured by a direct HPLC method. Ibuprofen and <b>ibufenac</b> were rapidly ab-sorbed and metabolized to their acyl glucuronides. The pharma-cokinetic parameters of ibuprofen and <b>ibufenac</b> exhibited notable interanimal variability. <b>Ibufenac</b> tended to have a higher area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC), and Its apparent clearance was lower. The plasma levels of acyl glucuronides were lower than parent drugs; the ratio of AUC in plasma for glucu-ronide/parent drug was 22. 8 % and 10. 5 % for ibuprofen and ibufe-nac, respectively. The degradation of <b>ibufenac</b> glucuronide in vitro was faster than ibuprofen glucuronide in aqueous buffer, human serum albumin, and human plasma solutions. Covalent binding o...|$|E
40|$|In {{cultures}} of mouse or chick embryo ceils several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (salicylates, <b>Ibufenac,</b> phenylbutazone, Indomethacin, flufenamic and mefenamic acids, CI- 583, and chloroquine) inhibit the multi-plication of various viruses (encephalomyocarditis, S ndbis, influenza A 2, Newcastle disease, herpes implex and vaccinia). Two factors were {{critical for the}} virus inhibitory action of these drugs: the concentration of serum and the pH of the medium. The antiviral effect of these drugs seems to be due mainly to limitation of intraceUular synthesis. However, salicylates and anthranilates also inhibit the adsorption and/or penetration of encephalo-myocarditis virus into mouse cells. The antiviral potency shows some correlation with other biochemical, cellular and clinical activities of these drugs...|$|E
40|$|In 1952 the {{research}} programme of Boots Pure Drug Company underwent a radical realignment {{under the new}} Research Director Dr. Gordon Hobday when attention was concentrated on ‘diseases of civilization’, in which was included rheumatic conditions. The 4 -biphenylyl compound was selected for a clinical trial in 1960; mindful of the adverse gastric effects of aspirin, believed {{to be due to}} the carboxylic acid group, the team elected to use the ethyl ester instead of the acid. The compound was totally inactive when given to rheumatoid patients at 1. 8 g/day. This setback represented the first major crisis point in the project as it cast doubts on the relevance of the utltraviolet erythema (UVE) test to the human disease condition. The abandonment of <b>ibufenac</b> was the second major crisis point in the project: phenylacetic acids had been eliminated by reason of side-effects in three clinically effective compounds, not detected in laboratory testing...|$|E
40|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are among}} the most widely used drugs on the market. Whilst they are considered safe, several NSAIDs have been withdrawn from the market as a result of adverse drug reactions. NSAIDs are extensively metabolised to their 1 -β-O-acyl glucuronides (AGs), and the risk of NSAID AGs covalently modifying biomacromolecules such as proteins or DNA, leading to immune responses and cellular dysfunction constitutes a major concern in drug discovery and development. The assessment of the degree of protein modification and potential toxicity of individual NSAID AGs is therefore of importance in both drug monitoring and development. Herein, we report the covalent reaction of 1 -β-O-acyl glucuronides of ibuprofen and several NSAID analogues with human serum albumin (HSA) protein in vitro under concentrations encountered in therapy. Stable transacylation and glycosylation adducts are formed; the observed protein product ratios can be rationalised by the degree of α-substitution in the acyl group. Structure-based protein reactivity correlations of AGs, such as these, may prove a useful tool in distinguishing between carboxylic acid-containing drugs of similar structure that ultimately prove beneficial (e. g., ibuprofen) from those that prove toxic (e. g., <b>ibufenac).</b> © 2014 the Partner Organisations...|$|E
40|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{constitute a}} family of drugs, which taken as a group, {{represents one of the}} most frequently prescribed around the world. Thus, not surprisingly NSAIDs, along with anti-infectious agents, list on the top for causes of Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI). The incidence of liver disease induced by NSAIDs reported in clinical studies is fairly uniform ranging from 0. 29 / 100 000 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 17 - 051] to 9 / 100 000 (95 % CI: 6 - 15). However, compared with these results, a higher risk of liver-related hospitalizations was reported (3 - 23 per 100 000 patients). NSAIDs exhibit a broad spectrum of liver damage ranging from asymptomatic, transient, hyper-transaminasemia to fulminant hepatic failure. However, under-reporting of asymptomatic, mild cases, as well as of those with transient liver-tests alteration, in conjunction with reports non-compliant with pharmacovigilance criteria to ascertain DILI and flawed epidemiological studies, jeopardize the chance to ascertain the actual risk of NSAIDs hepatotoxicity. Several NSAIDs, namely bromfenac, <b>ibufenac</b> and benoxaprofen, have been withdrawn from the market due to hepatotoxicity; others like nimesulide were never marketed in some countries and withdrawn in others. Indeed, the controversy concerning the actual risk of severe liver disease persists within NSAIDs research. The present work intends (1) to provide a critical analysis of the dissimilar results currently available in the literature concerning the epidemiology of NSAIDS hepatotoxicity; and (2) to review the risk of hepatotoxicity for each one of the most commonly employed compounds of the NSAIDs family, based on past and recently published data...|$|E
