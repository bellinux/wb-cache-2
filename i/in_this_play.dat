5|$|Hazlitt found sheer {{delight in}} A Midsummer Night's Dream, {{especially}} relishing its playfully inventive poetry and quoting at length {{several of his}} favourite passages. He also considers how it exhibits the fine discrimination of character to be found everywhere in Shakespeare. As elsewhere, he crosses the boundaries of plays and enumerates subtle differences between even the fairy characters, in this case in an extensive comparison of Puck <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play</b> and Ariel in The Tempest.|$|E
5|$|However, he now {{increasingly}} {{began to}} win leading parts on television, and in 1953 was {{cast by the}} television director Rudolph Cartier in a play called It Is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer. Cartier was impressed with Morell's performance <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play,</b> and offered him the leading role in a science-fiction serial he was preparing with the writer Nigel Kneale, entitled The Quatermass Experiment. Morell considered the not-yet-completed script, but decided to decline the offer; the part went instead to his co-star from It Is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer, Reginald Tate.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, it was {{confirmed}} that Grint {{will be making}} his stage debut in Jez Butterworth's second run of his black comedy, Mojo, playing the role as a minor hood called Sweets who pops amphetamines like Smarties and does a sort of double act, full of comic menace. Grint will be starring alongside actors Brendan Coyle, Ben Whishaw and Daniel Mays. The play is based on real-life events and ran from 26 October 2013 until 8 February 2014 at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London. He won the WhatsOnStage Award for Best London Newcomer for his role <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1954, Takechi {{followed}} Susugigawa with a noh-kyōgen {{version of}} Junji Kinoshita's Yūzuru. Yūzuru {{is one of}} the most successful Japanese post-World War II plays, having received over a thousand performances at schools and theaters both within Japan and internationally since its debut in 1949. Composer Ikuma Dan wrote an opera version of the play in 1952. Since its premiere, Dan's opera has been performed more than 550 times, making it possibly the most popular opera written in Japanese. Dan was recruited to write the original music for Takechi's production of the play. Dan combined the noh-style solo vocal lines with a Western orchestra and chorus. On the same program as Yūzuru was another Takechi-directed kyōgen, Higashi wa Higashi (East is East), a parody of the kyōgen style. Among the innovations Takechi made <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play</b> was the inclusion of a former Takarazuka actress in the usually all-male kyōgen cast. In the ultra-conservative noh and kyōgen communities, simply appearing in a rival school's production could result in an actor's excommunication from the profession. Because of the public attention drawn through Takechi's relentless publicity work and communication with the media, punitive actions against actors who worked with Takechi were avoided.|$|E
5|$|Sycorax {{has been}} conceptualised {{in a variety}} ways by {{adapters}} and directors of The Tempest. In John Dryden and William Davenant's version of The Tempest (1670), Sycorax is survived by two children, Caliban and a daughter also named Sycorax. This second Sycorax makes sexual advances toward Trinculo, the drunken sailor, and (according to Trinculo) also has incestuous relations with her brother Caliban. Die Geisterinsel, a 1778 version of the play in German, includes a living Sycorax, a witch who has full power during the night, while Prospero rules the day. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>play,</b> {{she is the one}} who causes the tempest and shipwreck, not Prospero; Prospero is extremely wary of her actions as each night approaches, as she has power over those who sleep. Several times he struggles to keep Miranda awake to protect her from Sycorax's power. In Eugène Scribe's French 1846 version, Sycorax is alive but imprisoned behind some rocks out of sight. She spends most of the play trying to convince her son, Caliban, to free her. Peter Brook's 1968 British version of the play portrayed Sycorax as an ugly witch, including her in a birth scene in which the equally ugly Caliban is born.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, Annie Russell {{performed}} in Boston, playing {{the title role}} in The Younger Mrs. Parling. She met her second husband, Oswald Yorke, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play.</b> Shortly after her marriage, Russell starred in a new play Brother Jacques.|$|E

25|$|Also {{writing in}} 1971, Hugh M. Richmond offered {{an entirely new}} view of the play's love story lines. He argued that what passes for love <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play</b> is {{actually}} a self-destructive expression of passion. He argued that the play's significant characters are all affected by passion and by a sadomasochistic type of sexuality. This passion prevents the lovers from genuinely communicating with each other. At {{the same time it}} protects them from the disenchantment with the love interest that communication inevitably brings. The exception to the rule is Bottom, who is chiefly devoted to himself. His own egotism protects him from feeling passion for anyone else. Richmond also noted that there are parallels between the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe, featured <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play,</b> and that of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.|$|E

25|$|There {{is also a}} small voice-only part of a man's voice (unclear {{whether it}} is the voice of the Chesters' father or just someone imitating it) {{towards the end of the}} play, {{whispering}} the names of the two daughters. Like Julia in Haunting Julia, the father <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play</b> can be considered a very strong off-stage character.|$|E

25|$|In 1902, Russell {{appeared}} in other plays with Ann Gilbert, in The Girl and the Judge. The play had great success, and ran from December 1901 {{to the fall}} of 1902. Subsequently, Russell starred in Mice and Men, still with Frohman's company. On December 30, 1902, Mrs. Roosevelt and other Washington dignitaries saw Russell perform <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>play,</b> Menander {{handles the}} typical formula of {{separation}} and reunion {{in a particularly}} elegant way. At the very moment when the breakup between Glykera and Polemon seems to be final, with the removal of her belongings from Polemon's house, the recognition scene starts: Pataikos sees her birth clothes and recognizes Glykera as his daughter, and this in turn leads to her reconciliation with Polemon.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Mordecai Marcus {{argued for}} a new meaning of Eros (Love) and Thanatos (Death) <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play.</b> In his view, Shakespeare {{suggests}} that love requires the risk of death. Love achieves force and direction from the interweaving of the life impulse with the deathward-release of sexual tension. He also viewed the play as suggesting that the healing force of love {{is connected to the}} acceptance of death, and vice versa.|$|E

At the same house in March 1883 he painted for the Storm-beaten of Robert Williams Buchanan, and in the October following for the opera of Rip Van Winkle at the Royal Comedy Theatre.|$|E
25|$|Gilbert created several {{plays for}} the Haymarket Theatre, managed by John Baldwin Buckstone and {{starring}} William Hunter Kendal and his wife, Madge Robertson Kendal, sister of the playwright Thomas William Robertson, in the early 1870s. In Charity, Gilbert wanted to use what he perceived as Mrs. Kendal's capabilities as a tragedienne, and, after abandoning his original plan of a vindictive villainess, he composed {{one of his most}} powerful women's roles for her <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Ralph Berry {{argued that}} Shakespeare was chiefly {{concerned}} with epistemology <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play.</b> The lovers declare illusion to be reality, the actors declare reality to be illusion. The play ultimately reconciles the seemingly opposing views and vindicates imagination. Also in 1972, Thomas McFarland {{argued that the}} play is dominated by a mood of happiness {{and that it is}} one of the happiest literary creations ever produced. The mood is so lovely that the audience never feels fear or worry about the fate of the characters.|$|E

Stewart had previously appeared only once alongside McKellen on stage, but the pair had developed a close friendship while waiting around on set filming the X-Men films. Stewart stated that performing <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play</b> was the fulfilment of a 50-year ambition, having seen Peter O'Toole appear in it at the Bristol Old Vic while Stewart was just 17. Reviewers stated that his interpretation captured well the balance between humour and despair that characterises the work.|$|E
25|$|In Death of a Salesman – {{originally}} entitled “The Inside of His Head” – Miller brilliantly {{solves the}} problem of revealing his main character's inner discord, rendering Willy Loman as solid as the society in which he tries to sell himself. Indeed, many critics believe that Miller has never surpassed his achievement <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play,</b> which stands as his breakthrough work, distinguished by an extremely long Broadway run, by many revivals, and by many theater awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1949. Death of a Salesman seems destined to remain an American classic and a standard text in American classrooms.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century {{brought new}} {{insights}} into the play. In 1961, Elizabeth Sewell argued that Shakespeare aligns himself not with the aristocrats of the play, but with Bottom and the artisans. It is their task to produce a wedding entertainment, precisely the purpose of the writer on working <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>play.</b> Also in 1961, Frank Kermode wrote on the themes of the play and their literary sources. He counted among them fantasy, blind love, and divine love. He traced these themes to the works of Macrobius, Apuleius, and Giordano Bruno. Bottom also briefly alludes to a passage from the First Epistle to the Corinthians by Paul the Apostle, dealing with divine love.|$|E
