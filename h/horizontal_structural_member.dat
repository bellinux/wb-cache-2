50|$|Beams and joist are <b>horizontal</b> <b>structural</b> <b>members</b> that {{distribute}} {{the dead and}} live load from the upper floors to the load-bearing walls. The beams and joist in Gedung Kuning are made out of timber {{because it was a}} readily available material back then. It is often made of Chengal, a hardwood that is resistant to the dead load transferred from the upper floors. It is an economical material as it could be sourced locally and has enough tensile strength to carry lateral loads. Main timber beams, which are key <b>horizontal</b> <b>structural</b> <b>members,</b> are parallel to Kandahar Street & Sultan Gate road and span between the walls. However, there are beams and joist that run in the perpendicular direction. Those beams are usually located in the outdoor spaces such as the fiveIfootway. This suggests that the direction of beams might indicate spaces that are outdoors and public, and spaces that are more private. The beams and joist rest on ledges where the wall diminish in thickness and act as a load-bearing surface. I-beams have been introduced into structures to replace rotten timber beams but in Gedung Kuning, it is used to support the current beams. Exposed IIbeams have to be encased in concrete for fire safety as well as aesthetics reasons (Fig. 3c). Reinforced concrete beams are used to support the upper storey of the five-footway.|$|R

In Euler – Bernoulli beam theory, shear deformations and rotation effects are neglected, and plane sections remain plane and normal to the longitudinal axis. In the Timoshenko beam theory, plane sections still remain plane but {{are no longer}} normal to the longitudinal axis. In this paper, we will be formulating the equations of motion of a free cantilever beam. The natural frequency of continuous beam system will be found out at different variables of beam using ANSYS 14. 0. The results will be compared further using experimentation by free vibration of a cantilever beam. Using those results, {{we will be able}} to compare the parameters in Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam. Free vibration takes place when a system oscillates under the action of forces integral in the system itself due to initial deflection, and under the absence of externally applied forces. The system will vibrate at one or more of its natural frequencies, which are properties of the system dynamics, established by its stiffness and mass distribution. The comparative displacement alignment of the vibrating system for a particular natural frequency is known as the Eigen function in continuous system. The mode shape of the lowest natural frequency (i. e. the fundamental natural frequency) is termed as the fundamental (or the first) mode frequency. The displacements at some points may be zero which are called the nodal points. Generally nth mode has (n- 1) nodes excluding the end points. The mode shape varies for different boundary conditions of a beam...|$|E

40|$|A {{common problem}} faced by {{engineers}} nowadays is the restriction on <b>structural</b> <b>member</b> dimensions due to architectural and spatial concerns. Such restrictions {{have resulted in}} the use of high-strength concrete in vertical members to reduce sizes, the use of central core walls and peripheral columns to increase window areas, the use of prestressed concrete floors to increase spans, etc. Serviceability problems such as cracking may, however, arise in the long term if these problems have not received proper attention during the design stage. This paper addresses several major issues associated with this type of buildings. Firstly, the differential axial shortening between the core walls and columns caused by large differences in stress levels will induce additional stresses and strains in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>structural</b> <b>members,</b> which are not normally accounted for in the traditional design methods. Secondly, the post-tensioning of concrete floors gives rise to additional internal forces induced in several ways such as time-dependent effects, sequential construction, and secondary “P-δ” effects of the high-strength slender columns. Thirdly, the soil-structure interaction could induce significant additional deformations and stresses in the buildings, although they are not always taken into account properly especially when carrying out simple or preliminary designs. These issues are vital and should be carefully considered in regular structural analyses and designs. With the common practice that most of the designs of prestressed concrete building structures are sublet to prestressing specialists, common structural engineers seldom have the insight into the structural performance of these buildings. Furthermore, utilities for calculating steel relaxation, which is an important factor governing the behaviour of prestressed concrete buildings, and its interactions with other time-dependent effects of concrete are hardly found in popular commercial software packages developed for building designs. All of these problems present obstacles in the correct modelling of prestressed concrete buildings. In the light of this, a practical but accurate method of modelling steel relaxation using the equivalent creep in commercial packages, that are normally good at dealing with complicated geometry, has firstly been developed in this work. The accuracy and reliability of the method are examined by comparing the results with available numerical solutions. Good agreement is observed. Secondly, a series of studies have been carried out based on a typical prestressed concrete building to examine various effects on the structural performance. It is found that the most influential effect is the time-dependent behaviour. It induces extra column moments, differential axial shortening, losses of tendon stresses, and P-delta moments. The construction sequence and soil-structure interactions are also found to affect the structural performance but they are less critical compared with the time-dependent effects. Finally, a parametric study has been carried out to evaluate the likely ranges of time-dependent effects on the structural behaviour. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|In two-sided {{structural}} cold plates, typically {{there is}} a <b>structural</b> <b>member,</b> such as a honeycomb panel, that provides the structural strength for the cold plates that cool equipment. The cold plates are located {{on either side of}} the <b>structural</b> <b>member</b> and thus need to have the cooling fluid supplied to them. One method of accomplishing this is to route the inlet and outlet tubing to both sides of the <b>structural</b> <b>member.</b> Another method might be to supply the inlet to one side and the outlet to the other. With the latter method, an external feature such as a hose, tube, or manifold must be incorporated to pass the fluid from one side of the <b>structural</b> <b>member</b> to the other. Although this is a more compact design than the first option, since it eliminates the need for a dedicated supply and return line to each side of the <b>structural</b> <b>member,</b> it still poses problems, as these external features can be easily damaged and are now new areas for potential fluid leakage. This invention eliminates the need for an external feature and instead incorporates the feature internally to the <b>structural</b> <b>member.</b> This is accomplished by utilizing a threaded insert that not only connects the cold plate to the <b>structural</b> <b>member,</b> but also allows the cooling fluid to flow through it into the <b>structural</b> <b>member,</b> and then to the cold plate on the opposite side. The insert also employs a cap that acts as a cover to seal the open area needed to install the insert.
