50|$|The primary design {{factors of}} a high {{efficiency}} glandless circulating pump include an electronically commutated synchronous motor, a permanent magnet rotor, and canned rotor technology. An electronically commutated synchronous motor is used to convert the energy current from a DC energy source into an AC current which is supplied to the drive motor. It utilizes the magnetomotive force which is generated by surface currents placed on the surfaces of the stator and rotor and the permanent magnets to generate the electric current which is in output to the drive motor. The canned rotor technology {{eliminates the need for}} a shaft seal that many conventional pumps must use through its unique design. Whereas standard pumps with shaft seals have multiple chambers with different rotating parts in each, canned rotor technology allows all of the rotating parts within the pump to exist in a single chamber. This increases the overall efficiency since the liquid used to lubricate the shaft bearings is also used to cool the motor. The electronic components of the motor are attached outside this system by means of an <b>encapsulated</b> <b>motor</b> cartridge, which is an independent metal compartment used solely for housing the electronic components.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterial}} flagellum {{consists of}} three basic components: a whip-like filament, a motor complex, and a hook that connects them. The filament is approximately 20nm in diameter and consists of several protofilaments, each made up of thousands of flagellin subunits. The bundle is held together by a cap and {{may or may not}} be <b>encapsulated.</b> The <b>motor</b> complex consists of a series of rings anchoring the flagellum in the inner and outer membranes, followed by a proton-driven motor that drives rotational movement in the filament.|$|R
40|$|Pod drives are modern {{outboard}} ship {{propulsion systems}} with a <b>motor</b> <b>encapsulated</b> in a watertight pod. The motorâ€™s shaft is connected directly {{to one or}} two propellers. The whole unit hangs from the stern of the ship and rotates azimuthally, thus providing thrust and steering without the need of a rudder. Force/momentum and phase-resolved LDA measurements were performed for inline co-rotating and contra-rotating propellers pod drive models (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1 P o d drive model and water tunnel balance The measurements permitted to characterize these ship propulsion systems in terms of their hydrodynamic characteristics. The torque delivered to the propellers and the thrust of the system were measured for different operation conditions of the propellers. These measurements lead to the hydrodynamic optimization of the ship propulsion system...|$|R
