25|$|The <b>exergue</b> is {{the space}} on a coin beneath the main design, {{often used to}} show the coin's date, {{although}} it is sometimes left blank or containing a mint mark, privy mark, or some other decorative or informative design feature. Many coins {{do not have an}} <b>exergue</b> at all, especially those with few or no legends, such as the Victorian bun penny.|$|E
25|$|A Two Pound coin was an {{occasional}} {{feature of the}} British currency from 1823 until 1996, and being minted each year since 1997. With the exception of proof coins issued in 1824, 1825, 1826, and 1831, {{the design of the}} reverse always featured the George and Dragon of Benedetto Pistrucci, with the year in the <b>exergue</b> under the design.|$|E
25|$|The 24 {{stars on}} the reverse convey the same message that the 2★4 on the obverse of some {{specimens}} does—that Missouri was the 24th state to enter the Union. The name SEDALIA, the first state capital and site of the centennial exposition, appears in <b>exergue.</b> Aitken's stylized monogram, RA, is near the rifle butt. The Missouri piece, and the Columbian half dollar of 1892–1893, are the only U.S. commemorative half dollars to bear none of the patriotic mottoes usually found on U.S. coinage, that is LIBERTY, IN GOD WE TRUST and E PLURIBUS UNUM. The design was liked {{at the time of}} issue; several specimens were shown and admired at the 1921 American Numismatic Association convention at Boston in August, soon after the coin's release.|$|E
60|$|Encompassed by the massy {{walls of}} this venerable academy, I passed, yet not in tedium or disgust, {{the years of}} the third lustrum of my life. The teeming brain of {{childhood}} requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe that my first mental development had in it much of the uncommon--even much of the outre. Upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression. All is gray shadow--a weak and irregular remembrance--an indistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me this is not so. In childhood I must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the <b>exergues</b> of the Carthaginian medals.|$|R

2500|$|The reverse {{displays}} {{the figures of}} Britannia and Natalia {{against a background of}} a landscape with Zulu huts. The name [...] "NATAL" [...] appears in the <b>exergue.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The reverse {{shows the}} Royal Crown resting on an oak sapling, {{flanked by a}} lion and a lioness above stylised waves. At the top left is the year [...] "1939" [...] {{and at the top}} right the year [...] "1945". The <b>exergue</b> has the words [...] "THE DEFENCE MEDAL" [...] in two lines.|$|E
2500|$|The reverse, {{designed}} by Harold Stabler, shows a merchant steamship ploughing through heavy seas, with an enemy submarine sinking on portside and a sailing {{ship in the}} background. The <b>exergue</b> is inscribed, in three lines, [...] "FOR•WAR•SERVICE", [...] "MERCANTILE•MARINE" [...] and [...] "•1914–1918•". Around the rim enclosing the whole image is a laurel wreath.|$|E
2500|$|The Memorial Plaque is a {{medallion}} {{designed by}} Edward Carter Preston, struck in bronze and [...] in diameter, which shows Britannia with two dolphins {{behind her and}} a male lion in the foreground. Around the perimeter the medallion is inscribed [...] "HE*DIED*FOR*FREEDOM*" [...] at left and [...] "*AND*HONOVR" [...] at right. The deceased's full name is in relief in a rectangular frame above the lion's head. The <b>exergue</b> depicts {{the defeat of the}} Prussian eagle by the British lion.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{appearance}} of the denomination was not until 1887, when the Jubilee head was used with the obverse inscription VICTORIA D G BRIT REG F D, while the reverse shows Pistrucci's [...] of Saint George slaying the dragon, with the only legend being the date in the <b>exergue.</b> The edge of this coin is milled, and it weighs 40grams. This coin was also (rarely) produced in the mint at Sydney, Australia, which is identified by the letter [...] "S" [...] above {{the centre of the}} date.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{appearance}} of the denomination was not until 1887 when the golden jubilee of Queen Victoria was being celebrated, when the Jubilee head was used with the obverse inscription VICTORIA D G BRIT REG F D, while the reverse shows Pistrucci's design of St George slaying the dragon with the only legend being the date in the <b>exergue.</b> The edge of this coin is milled, and it weighs 16 grams. This coin was also (rarely) produced in the mint at Sydney, Australia, which is identified by the letter [...] "S" [...] above {{the centre of the}} date.|$|E
2500|$|Dupré {{created an}} elegant design, {{especially}} interesting {{for the position}} of the wings, which are more horizontal ("extended" [...] in heraldic terms) than most other emblazonments. The eagle itself was unmistakably a bald eagle, without a crest. The five-pointed stars were arranged in a six-pointed star pattern (like the future 1841 die). The clouds are in an inverted arc, much like the official die, but the rays of the glory extend down beyond the clouds and in back of the eagle. [...] Dupré added a UNITED STATES OF AMERICA legend around the sides, and a small rosette of leaves in the <b>exergue</b> below the eagle. For the reverse, Dupré apparently followed one of Jefferson's suggestions, depicting a scene of international commerce portrayed as Mercury (the god of diplomacy) in conference with the genius of America (shown as an Indian chief, similar to some early American copper coins).|$|E
2500|$|The next coin of {{this value}} {{did not appear}} until early in the reign of Queen Victoria, {{when one of the}} most famous and {{attractive}} of all British coins was produced, colloquially known as the Una and the Lion coin. [...] Una and the Lion are characters in Spenser's The Faerie Queene, this five pounds piece has acquired a cult significance among collectors: the obverse shows the young head of the Queen, facing left with the legend VICTORIA D G BRITANNIARUM REGINA F D, while the reverse shows Queen Victoria as Una leading the lion to the left, with the legend DIRIGE DEUS GRESSUS MEOS – May the Lord direct my steps (some coins say DIRIGIT instead of DIRIGE – The Lord directs my steps) – with the date MDCCCXXXIX in the <b>exergue</b> under the lion. The edge may either have the inscription DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI TERTIO or be plain. This issue is the lightest of all the £5 coins, weighing only 38.7–39.3grams.|$|E
6000|$|No, VI. 1724.--Hibernia, seated as in {{the three}} preceding; round her, HIBERNIA: in the <b>exergue,</b> 1724. (Snelling, plate 2, Numb. 26.) ...|$|E
6000|$|No. II. 1722.--Hibernia {{is seated}} {{as in the}} last, but has her head turned to the left, on which side there is a rock; round her is inscribed, HIBERNIA; in the <b>exergue,</b> 1722; on the obverse the usual head, the inscription, GEORGIUS D.G. REX. (Snelling, plate 2, Numb. 24.) ...|$|E
60|$|The type of {{the bull}} on the coins of Sybaris and Thurium, in Magna Græcia, has been considered, with great probability, a {{representation}} of this kind. On the coins of Sybaris, which are of a very early period, the head {{of the bull}} is turned round; on those of Thurium, he stoops his head, butting: the first of these actions has been thought to symbolise the winding course of the river, the second, its headlong current. On the coins of Thurium, the idea of water is further suggested by the adjunct of dolphins and other fish in the <b>exergue</b> of the coin. The ground on which the bull stands is indicated by herbage or pebbles. This probably represents the river bank. Two bulls' head occur on the coins of Sardis, and it has been ingeniously conjectured by Mr. Burgon that the two rivers of the place are expressed under this type.|$|E
