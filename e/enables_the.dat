5|$|Although many non-sessile {{bivalves}} {{use their}} muscular foot to move around, or to dig, {{members of the}} freshwater family Sphaeriidae are exceptional in that these small clams climb about quite nimbly on weeds using their long and flexible foot. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum), for example, climbs around on water weeds {{at the edges of}} lakes and ponds; this <b>enables</b> <b>the</b> clam to find the best position for filter feeding.|$|E
5|$|Damage to DNA {{alters the}} spatial {{configuration}} of the helix, and such alterations can be detected by the cell. Once damage is localized, specific DNA repair molecules bind {{at or near the}} site of damage, inducing other molecules to bind and form a complex that <b>enables</b> <b>the</b> actual repair to take place.|$|E

5|$|Fabry-Pérot etalons {{are widely}} used in telecommunications, lasers and {{spectroscopy}} to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Dichroic filters are multiple layer thin-film etalons. In telecommunications, wavelength-division multiplexing, the technology that <b>enables</b> <b>the</b> use of multiple wavelengths of light through a single optical fiber, depends on filtering devices that are thin-film etalons. Single-mode lasers employ etalons to suppress all optical cavity modes except the single one of interest.|$|E

5|$|In {{the tropics}} {{there is little}} {{variation}} in the length of day throughout the year, and it is always warm enough for a food supply, but altitudinal migration occurs in some tropical birds.

5|$|Mammals {{include the}} biggest animals on the planet, the great whales.
