40|$|By {{developing}} a wind-vehicle-bridge coupling dynamic analysis system, the <b>impact</b> <b>coefficient</b> of traffic flows on a cable-stayed bridge and its probabilistic distribution are {{studied in the}} paper. Some important influence factors of the <b>impact</b> <b>coefficient,</b> such as the vehicle-bridge coupling effect, traveling velocity, and traffic density, are analyzed. The influence of the coupling effect between a bridge deck’s buffeting and vehicles’ vibration on the <b>impact</b> <b>coefficient</b> of traffic flows on a cable-stayed bridge is paid due attention to. The results show that vehicle-bridge coupling effect and surface roughness exert important influence on the impact effect of a cable-stayed bridge. Considering that <b>impact</b> <b>coefficient</b> of traffic flows on a bridge bears the characteristics of randomness, the paper, {{on the basis of}} a large number of samples, interprets the influence of traveling velocity and traffic density in view of its probabilistic distribution. In view of results derived from the coupling dynamic analysis, it is suggested that the <b>impact</b> <b>coefficient</b> be 25 % for all spans of a long cable-stayed bridge like the Sutong Yangtze Bridge...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact force}} {{response}} of a peach impacting {{on a metal}} flat-surface was considered as nondestructive determination of firmness. The objectives were to analyze the effect of firmness, drop height, fruit mass, and impact orientation on the impact force parameters, and to establish {{a relationship between the}} impact force parameter and firmness. The effect of fruit firmness, drop height and fruit mass on the impact force parameters (coefficient of restitution, percentage of energy absorbed, and coefficient of force-time) was evaluated. The study found that the coefficient of restitution, percentage of energy absorbed, and force-time <b>impact</b> <b>coefficient</b> were significantly affected by fruit ripeness, but not affected by drop height, impact position (fruit cheek), and mass. The percentage of absorbed energy increased with ripeness, while the force-time <b>impact</b> <b>coefficient</b> and coefficient of restitution decreased with ripeness. Relationships were obtained between the three impact characteristic parameters (force-time <b>impact</b> <b>coefficient,</b> coefficient of restitution, and percentage of energy absorbed) and peach firmness using a polynomial model (R 					 2 = 0. 932), S model (R 					 2 = 0. 910), and exponential model (R 					 2 = 0. 941), respectively...|$|E

Two proposed models are produced by using the best-fitted electron and hole <b>impact</b> ionization <b>coefficients</b> over the wide range of electric fields. The <b>impact</b> ionisation <b>coefficients</b> for Model A converge at the high electric field region while for Model B the <b>impact</b> ionisation <b>coefficients</b> diverge.

A random ionisation path length model is used for the electron- and hole-initiated multiplication in the multiplication region of 0. 1 μm and 0. 2 μm for short devices, and also 1. 3 μm, 2. 0 μm, 3. 6 μm and 4. 6 μm for long devices. The simulation is based on the dead space effect as well as by excluding the dead space effect in our work. It is found that the dead space effect becomes significant in short devices.

Their lower Imp 2 ̆ 7 s bringing smaller impacts of ED_A can be considered reasonably to contribute their adaptabilities to the desert conditions. Furthermore, ΔED_A and ΔImp triggered dynamics of plant water relations through the water balance, and midday stomatal depression on a fair day was attributed to larger ΔED_A and ΔImp but not to higher transpiration rate.

To estimate the impact effects of long-span railway bridges subjected to moving vehicles, a real long-span railway cable-stayed bridge is regarded as the research object in this study, and a coupled model of vehicle-bridge system is established. The track irregularities are taken as the system excitation and the dynamic responses of the vehicle-bridge system are calculated. The impact effects on main girder, stayed cable, bearings, and bridge tower are discussed at various vehicle speeds. The results show that different components of the long-span railway cable-stayed bridge have different impact coefficients.

40|$|Geology {{and land}} use and land cover are the most {{important}} factors that influence water quality. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate how these factors operate in a rural watershed. Specifically, this thesis tests the feasibility of a proposed formula to relate how land use affects surface water quality and to infer hydrogeochemical reactions that control water chemistry through hydrogeochemical speciation and mineral stability relationships. Samples were collected from Indian Lake and its watershed in West-Central Ohio. BASINS, produced by the USEPA, was then used to delineate sub-watersheds and find the land use areas of these watersheds. The proposed formula was applied to find the land use <b>impact</b> <b>coefficient</b> of nitrate for various land covers. Due to data limitations only agricultural and forested land were able to be solved for. The land use <b>impact</b> <b>coefficient</b> for an agricultural area was 0. 01 - 0. 2 mg/l-acre. The land use <b>impact</b> <b>coefficient</b> for a forested area was solved using a series of linear equations and was approximately - 0. 06 to - 0. 01 mg/l-acre. This value indicates that agricultural is a source of nitrate and forests are sinks of nitrate. Several strong correlations, using a Pearson Correlation, were found including sodium and chloride indicating the application of road salt. Another correlation found was the relationship between calcium, magnesium and alkalinity. The correlation indicated a bedrock of limestone or dolomite, which is confirmed by the literature. Finally, a hydrogeochemical speciation was carried out to determine clay mineral stability. Kaolinite was found to be the dominant clay mineral in the watershed.

This dissertation offers a collection of mod-els that provide insight into the structure of modern financial markets, and can help to optimize trading decisions in practical applications. In {{the first part of the}} thesis we study the dynamics of prices, order flows and liquidity in limit order markets over short timescales.

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a {{framework}} for determination of energy losses resulting from mechanical impacts of the kind that could occur during nuclear decommissioning of waste material. Measurements have been made of final translational and rotational velocities for impacts between projectiles of different length and a massive barrier. This enabled determination of experimental values of the <b>impact</b> <b>coefficients</b> and energy losses. It was found that the total energy losses could be accurately accounted for by the sum of those pertaining to the normal and tangential processes, thus indicating that these include any losses due to vibration. The results obtained clearly support an Amontons–Coulomb friction model and the previously held contention that there is a limiting value for the impulse ratio at low angles of barrier inclination. Although sliding surfaces are likely to be modified during impact, it is shown that any original contamination on the contacting surfaces results in a very large decrease in impulse ratio or friction coefficient. This represents an important finding in the context of mechanical ignition testing indicating that the state of the impact surfaces and their handling need to be taken into account.
