5|$|The body {{structure}} of domesticated rats <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> {{of a wild}} rat as well. The body of a fancy rat is smaller, with larger ears and a longer tail than that of its undomesticated counterpart. They are generally smaller with sharper facial features as well.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{relationship}} between three parenting styles (authoritarian, permissive, and authoritative) and {{the mental health}} of Arab adolescents was tested. It was hypothesized that parenting style toward boys would <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> towards girls, psychological adjustment of girls would <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of boys, and that the authoritarian style applied within the authori-tarian Arab society is not associated with poor psychological adjustment...|$|R
5|$|Beyond the First Amendment: The Politics of Free Speech and Pluralism is a {{book about}} {{freedom of speech and}} the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, written by author Samuel Peter Nelson.

In it, Nelson discusses how the more general notion of free speech <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> specifically applied to the First Amendment in American law.|$|E
5|$|Buena Vista {{features}} an early architectural style that <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> at Motul de San José, consisting of platforms built from unworked stone, with wide front stairways and probably without superstructures. They {{were built in}} the Middle to Late Preclassic periods and then reused in the Late Classic. The differences in style between Buena Vista and Motul probably results from differing epochs of construction.|$|E

5|$|The Kibble balance {{requires}} extremely {{precise measurement}} of the local gravitational acceleration g in the laboratory, using a gravimeter. For instance, the NIST compensates for Earth's gravity gradient of 309µGal per metre when the elevation {{of the center of}} the gravimeter <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of the nearby test mass in the Kibble balance; a change in the weight of a one-kilogram test mass that equates to about 316µg/m.|$|E
5|$|The {{order of}} the Old Testament books in the Codex is as follows: Genesis to 2 Chronicles as normal; 1 Esdras; 2 Esdras (Ezra-Nehemiah); the Psalms; Proverbs; Ecclesiastes; Song of Songs; Job; Wisdom; Ecclesiasticus; Esther; Judith; Tobit; the minor prophets from Hosea to Malachi; Isaiah; Jeremiah; Baruch; Lamentations and the Epistle of Jeremiah; Ezekiel and Daniel.

5|$|An {{unidentified}} dark parrot seen {{alive by}} the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa {{was given the}} name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed {{it was from the}} Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of the Mascarene parrot. This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations of the scientific names, such as Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura. The unidentified parrot may have been an African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) instead.|$|E
5|$|During the Palladian revival {{period in}} Ireland, even quite modest mansions were {{cast in a}} neo-Palladian mould. Palladian {{architecture}} in Ireland subtly <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> in England. While adhering as in other countries to the basic ideals of Palladio, it is often truer to them – perhaps because it was often designed by architects who had come directly from mainland Europe, and therefore were not influenced by the evolution that Palladianism was undergoing in Britain. Whatever the reason, Palladianism still had to be adapted for the wetter, colder weather.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{principal}} Upanishads {{can be associated with}} one of the schools of exegesis of the four Vedas (shakhas). Many Shakhas are said to have existed, of which only a few remain. The new Upanishads often have little relation to the Vedic corpus and have not been cited or commented upon by any great Vedanta philosopher: their language <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of the classic Upanishads, being less subtle and more formalized. As a result, they are not difficult to comprehend for the modern reader.|$|E

5|$|In Manhattan, uptown means north (more {{precisely}} north-northeast, {{which is}} the direction the island and its street grid system are oriented) and downtown means south (south-southwest). This usage <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of most American cities, where downtown refers to the central business district. Manhattan has two central business districts, the Financial District at {{the southern tip of}} the island, and Midtown Manhattan. The term uptown also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd Street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th Street, with Midtown covering the area in between, though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation.|$|E

The dark colour of the cap reaches below the eye and can be seen, diffused, to the ear-coverts. Behind the ear-coverts {{on the sides of}} the neck, there are white ovals. The rest of the neck is grey to brownish-grey in colour and has white that varies in amount. The breast is white, and the abdomen is whitish. The flanks are coloured in a mix of blackish-grey with white flecks. The colour of the bill when not breeding <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of the breeding plumage, with the former being significantly more grey.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of extraterrestrial intelligence would have various impacts on biology and astrobiology. The {{discovery of}} extraterrestrial life in any form, intelligent or non-intelligent, would give humanity greater {{insight into the}} nature of life on Earth and would improve the conception of how the tree of life is organized. Human biologists could learn about extraterrestrial biochemistry and observe how it <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> found on Earth.

5|$|The {{handwriting}} of {{the text}} {{from the beginning of}} Luke to 1 Corinthians 10:8, <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of the rest parts of the manuscript. Some letters have Coptic shapes (f.e. Α, Μ, Δ, and Π). The letters are more widely spaced and are a little larger than elsewhere. Delta has extended base and Pi has extended cross-stroke. Numerals are not expressed by letters except in Apocalypse 7:4; 21:17. In the past the codex had been judged to be carelessly written, with many errors of transcription, but not so many as in the Codex Sinaiticus, nor more than in the Codex Vaticanus.|$|E
5|$|The {{pages of}} the Grolier Codex contain seven hieroglyphs {{representing}} days; the style of these glyphs <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> {{of the other three}} Maya codices but is most similar to the glyphs of the Dresden Codex. The glyphs are arranged in vertical columns incorporating day signs accompanied by a number; each date corresponds to a manifestation of Venus. Whereas the Venus almanac in the Dresden Codex documents the planet after inferior conjunction as the morning star, the Grolier Codex documents all four of the stations of Venus: rising after inferior conjunction as morning star in the east, disappearance before superior conjunction, reappearance as evening star in the west and disappearance before inferior conjunction.|$|E
