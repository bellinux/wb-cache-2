Most of his woodcuts were created from dead or damaged tree parts that he collected and took to his studio to prepare cross-sections {{of the wood}} <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> <b>printing.</b> In 2012, Chronicle Books published Woodcut, a book which displays a selection of Gill's prints; it was named one of The New York Times Magazines best books of the year. An exhibition by the same name, composed of 30 of Gill's prints, was displayed at the Chicago Botanic Garden in early 2013. He created prints from a large variety of trees, of which the oldest was a fallen 200-year-old chestnut tree once planted by Frederick Law Olmsted.|$|E

50|$|Nückel, who had {{exhibited}} {{skill as}} an artist in his childhood, was dropped out of medical school in Freiburg im Breisgau and moved to Munich where he resided {{for the remainder of}} his life. There he developed his skill in drawing and painting, joining the artists' association, the Munich Sezession, and developing an interest in <b>relief</b> <b>printing.</b> Because of the scarcity of wood, Nückel made engravings <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> <b>prints</b> on lead plates. A pioneer in lead engraving, Nückel developed an accomplished mastery of this medium, distinguished by ample use of the multiple-line tool. He illustrated works by Thomas Mann, E. T. A. Hoffman and others before garnering considerable attention with his own publication Destiny: A story in pictures (Schicksal. Eine Geschicte in Bildern. Munich: Delphin Verlag, 1930). This wordless novel highlights the life and suffering of a female protagonist as a vehicle for a dark social critique. Much of Nückel's work favors dark comedy, profound irony and an often scathing sarcasm.|$|R

50|$|Different tonal {{effects and}} vibrant colours can be {{achieved}} with the technique due to the depth of relief and differential inking that results from the collagraph plate's highly textured surface. Collagraphy is a very open printmaking method. Ink may {{be applied to the}} upper surfaces of the plate with a brayer <b>for</b> a <b>relief</b> <b>print,</b> or ink may be applied to the entire board and then removed from the upper surfaces but remain in the spaces between objects, resulting in an intaglio print.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to use {{engineering}} software to design and cut wood blocks <b>for</b> use in <b>relief</b> <b>printing.</b> Historically, the process of cutting away “white space” on wood blocks was done by hand. Instead this project was designed using three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) software and transformed into computerized numerical control (CNC) machine processes using computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software. Two key blocks were designed, with one accompanied by two support blocks. All four blocks were cut from medium density fiberboard (MDF) in the Prototyping and Fabrication Service Center in Howe 1380. The {{next step was to}} apply ink to what remained of the original wood surface and use a printing press to transfer the ink to paper. A series of prints were made from the blocks, experimenting with different ink color, orientation, and block combinations...|$|R

Through the linocut, it can produced interesting artwork of <b>relief</b> <b>printing.</b> Besides the processing was easy and simple, this printing technique is easy to be understood {{in a relatively short}} time.

It can also bring forward the expression through the resulting work of printmaking, so that the <b>relief</b> <b>printing</b> becomes an alternative media to convey the message. By the relatively low cost, anyone could begin to learn this printing technique. Almost the whole working process was done manually, with a drop of equipment. Starting from the process of image planning, cutting process, until the printing process, all of these phases could be done without the support of developing technologies. Many opinions said that the rapidly developing technologies make the work easier, but instead several aesthetics value could not be achieved by sophisticated technology.  </p...|$|R

500|$|Typically, wordless novels used <b>relief</b> <b>printing</b> {{techniques}} such as woodcuts, wood engraving, metalcuts, or linocuts. [...] One of the oldest <b>printing</b> techniques, <b>relief</b> <b>printing</b> has its origins in 8th-century China and was introduced to Europe in the 15th century. [...] It requires an artist to draw or transfer an image to a printing block; the areas not to be printed (the white areas) are cut away, leaving raised areas to which ink is applied to make prints. [...] The monochrome prints were usually in black ink, and occasionally in a different colour such as sienna or orange. [...] <b>Relief</b> <b>printing</b> is an inexpensive but labour-intensive printing technique; it was accessible to socially conscious artists who wanted to tell wordless stories of the working classes.|$|R
