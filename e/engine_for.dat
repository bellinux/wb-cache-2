5|$|A {{separate}} partnership {{was formed}} between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca {{to develop the}} Adour afterburning turbofan engine. The Br.121 was proposed with Turbomeca's Tourmalet <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> ECAT but Breguet preferred the RR RB.172 and their joint venture would use elements of both. The new engine, which {{would be used for}} the AFVG as well, would be built in Derby and Tarnos.|$|E
5|$|After {{testing the}} <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> several years, {{both in the}} air and on the ground, CFMI searched for {{customers}} outside of a possible AMST contract. The main targets were re-engine contracts for the Douglas DC-8 and the Boeing 707 airliners, including the related military tanker, the KC-135 Stratotanker. There was little initial interest in the engine, but Boeing realized that the CFM56 might be a solution to upcoming noise regulations. After announcing that a 707 would be configured with the CFM56 <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> flight tests in 1977, Boeing officially offered the 707-320 with the CFM56 engine as an option in 1978. The new variant was listed as the 707-700. Due to limited interest from the airlines in a re-engined 707, Boeing ended the 707-700 program in 1980 without selling any aircraft. Despite the lack of sales, having the commercial 707 available with the CFM56 helped the engine's competitiveness for the KC-135 re-engine contract.|$|E
5|$|Despite the project's termination, the two {{companies}} continued to take different paths toward an enhanced Harrier. Hawker Siddeley focused on a new larger wing that could be retrofitted to existing operational aircraft, while McDonnell Douglas independently pursued a less ambitious, though still expensive, project catering {{to the needs of}} the US military. Using knowledge gleaned from the AV-16 effort, though dropping some items—such as the larger Pegasus engine—McDonnell Douglas kept the basic structure and <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> an aircraft tailored for the USMC.|$|E
50|$|Rybinsk Motors was {{originally}} {{known as the}} Kolesov Engine Design Bureau. Kolesov took over the organization from V.A. Dobrynin who founded it in the late 1930s or early 1940s. Under Kolesov's direction, the bureau designed turbojet <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> the Myasishchev M-50 Bounder experimental supersonic bomber, turbojets for the Tu-22 Blinder medium bomber, RD-36-35FVR lift <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> the Yak-38 Forger, RD-36-51A supersonic <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> the Tu-144 SST, RD-36-51V <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> the Myasishchev M-17 Mystic, and lift <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> the Yak-141 Freestyle.|$|R

50|$|The {{company has}} also {{supplied}} 120 <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> trainsets, and 60 <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> railbuses.|$|R
5|$|Development {{began in}} November 1994 by the lead programmer, Simon Carter, and took {{two and a}} half years to develop. The game used the <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> Magic Carpet, and the first version was merely {{scrolling}} around a map and entering third-person. The engine was built by Glenn Corpes. Molyneux then developed a 2D prototype containing features that made it into the final game. The prototype focused on constructing the dungeon, and included the Treasure room, Hatchery, Training room, and Dungeon Heart. The characters were designed by the artist, Mark Healey.|$|E
5|$|For 1966, {{the engine}} {{capacity}} limit in Formula One was doubled from 1.5litres (92cuin) to 3litres (183cuin). It was not feasible to enlarge existing 1.5-litre engines {{to take full}} advantage of the higher limit and Climax chose not to develop a new 3-litre motor, leaving many teams without a viable <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> 1966.|$|E
5|$|Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary was {{developed}} as a partnership between development studios 343 Industries, Saber Interactive, and Certain Affinity. 343 Industries, the Halo series' franchise overseers, approached Saber Interactive to develop a remake of the original Halo in time for its tenth anniversary. After considering whether to remake the game entirely or to adapt and add features to the existing PC version, Saber decided to use its game <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> reproducing the original's appearance and the original Halos <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> gameplay. A development tool for toggling between {{the old and new}} visuals became a game feature. Anniversarys enhancements include a complete high-definition visual overhaul, support for cooperative and multiplayer gameplay via the Xbox Live online service, new and remastered sound effects and music, and extras such as achievements and hidden in-game collectibles. The game is the first in the series to include Kinect support.|$|E

5|$|In later years, Bradbury {{branched}} out, {{constructing the}} Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility {{to develop the}} laboratory's role in nuclear science. During the Space Race of the 1960s, the laboratory worked on Project Rover, developing the Nuclear <b>Engine</b> <b>for</b> Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). The laboratory demonstrated the feasibility and value of nuclear rocket propulsion.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Bradbury {{oversaw the}} {{development}} of thermonuclear weapons, although a falling out with Edward Teller over the priority given to their development {{led to the creation}} of a rival nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. In later years, he branched out, constructing the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility to develop the laboratory's role in nuclear science, and during the Space Race of the 1960s, the laboratory developed the Nuclear <b>Engine</b> <b>for</b> Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). The Bradbury Science Museum is named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1983, {{members of}} the 42d Air Refueling Squadron escorted a {{crippled}} F-4E Phantom II over the Atlantic Ocean after it experienced the loss of an <b>engine.</b> <b>For</b> its actions, crew E-113 received the Mackay Trophy for refueling it four times and towing it with its refueling boom.|$|E
500|$|The {{location}} of the Pittsburgh factory in the Mississippi River watershed was important {{in the development of}} high-pressure steam <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> the use in steamboats, and the new company began to promote its <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> river transport. Evans had long been a believer in the application of steam <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> maritime purposes. In his book of 1805, Evans had stated: ...|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{locomotives}} were 4-4-0 tank <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> {{passenger trains}} and 0-6-0 tank <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> goods trains. Later some smaller locomotives were purchased for branch {{lines and the}} dock branches.|$|R
50|$|By 1954 {{the bureau}} was {{designing}} liquid-propellant rocket <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> super performance and experimental aircraft, the Yak-27V and E-50A, and from 1957 to 1962 they designed <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> anti-aircraft guided missiles. By the early 1960s the bureau was designing Liquid Propellant Rocket <b>Engines</b> (LPREs) <b>for</b> man-rated space launch vehicles.|$|R
5|$|Power {{was to be}} {{supplied}} by all three engines offered to A330-200 and A330-300 with lower gross weight. Airbus also considered using the new Engine Alliance GP7000 <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> the A330-300HGW, {{which would have been}} the engine's first twinjet application. The −300HGW was to enter airline service in 2004. However, the -300HGW programme was not launched and quietly disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Research is {{important}} in 4X games because technological progress is an <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> conquest. Battles are often won by superior military technology or greater numbers, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. In contrast, military upgrades in non-4X games are sometimes small enough that technologically basic units remain important throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Some {{teams had}} made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Honda introduced a more powerful version of its V10 <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> Saturday's qualifying session and the race. Sauber brought lighter components to reduce the weight of their cars and the Williams team arrived with a revised rear wing. Williams engine suppliers BMW confirmed that they would be running the same specification of engine introduced in Belgium.|$|E
50|$|From 1841, {{the company}} began a batch of <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> the broad gauge Great Western Railway. The largest order came in 1847 <b>for</b> 28 2-2-2 <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> the London and South Western Railway.|$|R
50|$|Filer & Stowell {{produced}} marine steam <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> {{a number}} of years, and were one of fourteen engine manufacturers to produce the triple expansion steam <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> the World War II Liberty ships.|$|R

5|$|The RAF sought more thrust {{than was}} {{available}} from the Avon 100 series; in response Rolls-Royce developed the Avon 200 series engine. This was an almost wholly new design, equipped with a new compressor {{to put an end}} to surge problems, an annular combustion chamber, and an improved fuel control system. The resulting Avon 203 produced 10,000lbf (44.48kN) of thrust, and was the <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> the Hunter F.6.|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} conceived in 1965 for a 1.5-litre (92-cubic inch) Coventry Climax engine, but never raced in this form. For the 1966 Formula One season the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) doubled the limit on engine capacity to 3litres (183cuin). Australian company Repco {{developed a new}} V8 <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> Brabham's use in 1966, but a disagreement between Brabham and Tauranac over the latter's role in the racing team left no time {{to develop a new}} car to handle it. Instead, the existing BT19 chassis was modified for the job.|$|E
5|$|The new 3-litre engines under {{development}} by competing team Ferrari had 12 cylinders. Jack Brabham, owner and lead driver of BRO, {{took a different}} approach to the problem of obtaining a suitable engine. He persuaded Australian company Repco to develop a new 3-litre eight-cylinder <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> him, largely based on available components; the engine would produce less power than Ferrari's, but would be lighter, easier to fix and more fuel efficient.|$|E
50|$|High Specific Power <b>Engines</b> <b>for</b> DRDO Nishant UAV - VRDE had {{developed}} lightweight, high specific power output <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> UAV application. These include two-stroke single-cylinder, twin-cylinder and four-cylinder engines, {{based on a}} modular concept.|$|R
50|$|Atmospheric {{flight is}} {{possible}} even on worlds with oxygen-deprived atmospheres. In order {{to leave a}} planet, the player will {{need to build a}} hybrid spacecraft with atmospheric <b>engines</b> (<b>for</b> lift-off), hydrogen <b>engines</b> (<b>for</b> entering orbit), and ion <b>engines</b> (<b>for</b> orbital maneuvering, as hydrogen is considerably more expensive.) Hybrid surface-to-orbit craft are considerably heavier than their space-only counterparts, but can be built compact enough to fit inside a standard hangar.|$|R
50|$|Judd and {{his company}} came back to F1 in the 1988 season {{supplying}} <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> Williams, Ligier and March. In 1991 Judd {{struck a deal with}} Scuderia Italia to supply V10 <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> a Dallara-designed car.|$|R
5|$|While moving {{within the}} cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> lift {{off from the}} Moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, {{stranding}} them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch. Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{considered}} {{the selection of}} Rolls-Royce to develop the advanced <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> the MRCA to be essential, and was strongly opposed to adopting an engine from an American manufacturer, {{to the point where}} the UK might have withdrawn over the issue. In September 1969, Rolls-Royce's RB 199 engine was selected to power the MRCA. One advantage over the US competition was that a technology transfer between the partner nations had been agreed; the engine was to be developed and manufactured by a joint company, Turbo-Union. The programme was delayed by Rolls-Royce's entry into receivership in 1971; the nature of the multinational collaboration process helped avoid major disruption of the Tornado programme. Research from the supersonic airliner Concorde contributed to the development and final design of the RB.199 and of the engine control units.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-6 (Istrebitel—fighter) {{began in}} September 1928 with a {{deadline}} for delivery for the first prototype of 1 August 1929 after the first prototypes of the Polikarpov I-3 were completed. Although the new fighter shared many {{of the characteristics of}} the earlier design, including the staggered sesquiplane, single-bay, layout of the wings, it was a new design which used a nine-cylinder, single-row, air-cooled Bristol Jupiter radial engine rather the water-cooled inline engine of its predecessor. It was designed by the OSS (—Landplane Department), later redesignated as OPO-1 (—Experimental Department) of Aviatrest ("Aviation Trust") under the supervision of Nikolai Polikarpov, head designer of the department. It was originally intended to be compared to the I-3, but this was changed to an evaluation of construction methods with the wooden construction I-6 compared to the mixed construction Polikarpov I-5. Both aircraft used the Jupiter VI <b>engine</b> <b>for</b> which a license had recently been negotiated.|$|E
25|$|After the First World War, the Versailles Treaty of 1919 {{prohibited}} airship {{production in}} Germany so Maybach turned to making high-speed diesel <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> naval and railroad use, and petrol <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> automobiles, but not complete automobiles.|$|R
