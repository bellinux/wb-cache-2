40|$|Considerable {{literature}} {{is now available}} on the deposition of CVD diamond onto flat substrates the most common being silicon. However, very little work has been reported on the deposition of diamond onto complex three-dimensional substrates such as dental burs, micro drills and biomedical implants. Diamond is hard, wear resistant, biocompatible and corrosion resistant and therefore is an attractive candidate for uses in dental tools and for medical devices. This study focuses on the deposition of diamond, using a hot filament CVD system, on cobalt-cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co) rotary cutting dental burs. Conventional dental burs are generally made of sintered polycrystalline diamond (PCD). These {{have a number of}} problems associated with heterogeneity of the crystallite, decreased cutting efficiency and a short life. A preferential (1 1 1) faceted diamond has been obtained after 12 h deposition at a growth rate of 1. 2 mum/h. Diamond coated WC-Co dental burs and conventional sintered burs are used in turning, milling and drilling operations for machining materials made from metal alloys and borosilicate glass.

This is of particular concern if the residue might contain prions. We investigated {{at the molecular level}} the removal of model and real-life proteinaceous contamination from model and practical surfaces by air plasma (ionised air) treatment. The surface-sensitive technique of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to assess the removal of proteinaceous contamination, with the nitrogen (N 1 s) photoelectron signal as its marker. Model proteinaceous contamination (bovine serum albumin) adsorbed on to a model surface (silicon wafer) and the residual proteinaceous contamination resulting from incubating surgical stainless steel (a practical biomaterial) in whole human blood exhibited strong N 1 s signals [16. 8 and 18. 5 atomic percent (at. %), respectively] after thorough washing. After 5 min air plasma treatment, XPS detected no nitrogen on the sample surfaces, indicating complete removal of proteinaceous contamination, down to the estimated XPS detection limit 10 ng/cm 2. Applying the same plasma treatment, the 7. 7 at. % nitrogen observed on a clinically cleaned <b>dental</b> <b>bur</b> was reduced to a level reflective of new, as-received burs. Contact angle measurements and atomic force microscopy also indicated complete molecular-level removal of the proteinaceous contamination upon air plasma treatment.

40|$|Tooth cooling during {{grinding}} process for cavity or crown preparation is very essential for keeping tooth vitality. In vivo experiments done by Zach and Cohen in 1965 show that 15 % of the teeth failed to recover when heated by 5. 50 C {{and if the}} interpulpal temperature was increased by 11. 10 C then in about 60 % of the cases the teeth didn't recover. Since then many in vitro experiments were carried out {{in order to determine}} the water flow needed to maintain the temperature rise below 5. 50 C. The widespread cooling method is based on a number of water jets or water spray directed to the center of the <b>dental</b> <b>bur.</b> With this method excessive amount of water has to be applied in order to guarantee that enough coolant will be introduced into the grinding area. This leads to an unpleasant feeling of the patient and formation of mist obstructing the dentists working area visibility. A new concept of inner cooling method where the cooling water is entered to a hollow bur and comes out at the tip of the bur close to the grinding area was tested by the modification of an air turbine driven handpiece allowing water supply through the air turbine into a hollow bur. Special hollow burs were designed and manufactured for those experiments. Two kinds of experiments were conducted comparing the common outer cooling method and the internal cooling method; in the first experimental series the comparison was done by grinding glass ceramic material while in the second series the two cooling methods were applied while grinding extracted teeth. The results show significant improvement when using the internal cooling system. There was a reduction of about 20 C while using the internal cooling system with the same water flow. The grinding of the extracted tooth was carried out by a dentistry student reporting improved visibility while using the internal cooling method. Further research and experiments will focus on developing a miniature system for entering the water into the high speed rotating bur, optimizing the cooling water flow rate with the internal cooling system, optimizing the position of the outlet holes at the tip of the bur, and developing a method for diamond coating of the hollow bur while keeping the holes in the tip of the bur open...|$|E
40|$|The {{deposition}} of diamond films by {{chemical vapour deposition}} onto tungsten carbide is an attractive proposition since {{it can lead to}} improvements in the life and performance of cutting tools. However, {{deposition of}} diamond onto cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co) <b>dental</b> <b>burs</b> and inserts are problematic due to the cobalt binder in the WC that provides additional toughness to the tool but it causes poor adhesion and low nucleation density. A number of surface treatments can be used to overcome these problems including chemical etching, ion implanting, interlayer coating and bias treatment. Negative biasing of the substrate is attractive because it can be controlled precisely; it is carried out in-situ, gives good homogeneity and results in improved adhesion. On flat substrates, such as copper and silicon, biasing has been shown to give better adhesion, improved crystallinity and smooth surface. In this study, we have used a modified hot filament chemical vapour deposition (HFCVD) system to coat complex shaped tools such as <b>dental</b> <b>burs</b> with polycrystalline diamond films, which have good adhesion and crystallinity. By applying a negative bias to the substrate, we show that the nucleation density, adhesion and surface properties can be improved.

30|$|The {{surgical}} treatment of limb-length discrepancy (LLD) > 2.5  cm was initially described by Phemister using an open technique {{to create an}} epiphysiodesis of the longer limb to allow the shorter limb to catch up prior {{to the end of}} growth [1]. Since the epiphysiodesis created a permanent growth arrest, an accurate assessment of the patient’s bone age was required to determine the appropriate timing for surgery. Physician concerns about overcorrection often resulted in the procedure being performed later than the ideal recommended time causing an undercorrection. Subsequently, Blount and Clarke developed the technique of epiphyseal stapling by placing three staples on the medial and lateral side spanning the physis to prevent longitudinal growth [2]. The major advantage of the stapling technique was the potential to reverse the growth arrest by removing the staples. Initial problems with staple breakage were addressed by reinforcing the 90 -degree angles of the staples, but staple dislodgments and pain over the staples caused many physicians to abandon this method.

MethodsA total of one hundred and twenty standardized samples of diamond <b>dental</b> <b>burs</b> were experimentally contaminated with E. coli (ATCC 25922), S. aureus (ATCC 6538) and C. albicans (ATCC 18804) and the spores of B. atrophaeus (ATCC 6633) for 30 min. After the contamination, the samples were exposed to ozonated water (10 mg/L O 3) for 10 or 30 min. The control group was composed of samples that were exposed to distilled water for 30 min. After the exposure to the ozonated water, 0. 1 mL aliquots were seeded onto BHI agar to count the colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) of E. coli, S. aureus, and B. atrophaeus. Sabouraud dextrose agar was used to count the CFU/mL of C. albicans. The results were subjected to an analysis of variance and the Tukey test. ResultsFor all of the microorganisms studied, the ozonated water reduced the number of CFU/mL after 10 and 30 min of sanitization, and this microbial reduction was dependent on the duration of the exposure to the ozonated water.

Diamond has excellent {{physical and chemical properties}} and has considerable potential for use in dental tools and biomedical implants. Since the 1950 s sintered diamond burs have been used and are made using diamond particles bonded onto the substrate using a binder matrix material. The binder contains potentially poisonous components such as nickel and CVD technology eliminates the use of such binder materials. Hot Filament Chemical Vapour Deposition (HFCVD) uses a horizontal filament mounted above the substrate. For 3 -D substrates the system was modified with the filament mounted vertically and the substrate held concentrically within the coil in a system called vertical filament CVD (VFCVD). Process optimisation was conducted on molybdenum wire and then diamond films were deposited onto metals such as titanium, molybdenum and tungsten carbide (WC-Co) burs. A pre-treatment was required on WC-Co burs using Murakami reagent was used for etching followed by acid etching to remove excess Co from the surface and improve adhesion. The growth rate, adhesion, surface roughness, composition and nucleation densities were all investigated. The substrate temperature influenced the compressive stress of the diamond films due to the thermal gradient, which is related to the position of the substrate within the filament. Machining tests showed that the wear rates of the coated diamond tools were considerably lower than the uncoated burs. These were quantified using a Figure of 5 Merit (F) which was then plotted against the number of holes drilled for uncoated, sintered and VFCVD diamond coated burs to assess the tool performances on human tooth material, acrylic and borosilicate glass.

40|$|With the {{progressive}} increase in partially and fully dentate seniors, fracture {{has become an}} increasingly common form of restored tooth failure. Dentin undergoes progressive changes in microstructure with patient age, and studies are now suggesting {{that there is a}} reduction in fatigue strength and fatigue crack growth resistance of this tissue. This dissertation explores aging of dentin, the influence of flaws that are introduced during restorative processes on the fatigue properties of dentin, and proposes models for characterizing the damage initiation and growth process during fatigue of dentin. Results from this investigation show that the fatigue crack growth properties (Paris Law parameters (C, m) and DeltaK th) of human dentin undergo the most significant changes at a patient age of 42 years. Based on the fatigue crack growth responses, three age groups were established including young (age &# 8804; 33), aged (34 &# 8804; age &# 8804; 49) and old (50 &# 8804; age) patients for further analysis. There were significant differences in the initiation and growth behavior between the tissues of patients from the three age groups. With regards to the influence of restorative processes, there was no influence on the quasi-static responses of dentin. However, the endurance limit of dentin treated with the <b>dental</b> <b>burs</b> (28 MPa) and abrasive air jet (35 MPa) were approximately 36 % and 20 % lower than that of the control (44 MPa), respectively. Both cutting processes caused a significant reduction (p&# 8804; 0. 0001) in fatigue strength. An accumulative damage model was developed to characterize fatigue of the control and bur treated dentin as well as provide a model for fatigue life prediction. The damage models were derived as a function of number of loading cycles (N), and ratio of applied stress to ultimate strength (r). The developed models provide estimations for the initial state of damage, the state of damage during the life, as well as the damage accumulation rate for cyclic loading of dentin. Using the experimental findings, a Damage Effect Model (DEM) was also developed to describe the influence of flaws introduced by bur treatment on fatigue of dentin. The DEM showed that the damage caused by bur treatment is uniform and independent of tubule orientation. Using the developed DEM for dentin with 0 � tubule orientation, material constants of bur treated dentin with 90 � orientation were estimated and used in predicting fatigue for controlled experimental conditions involving a notched fatigue approach. Overall, {{the results of this study}} provide fundamental knowledge concerning the influence of aging and cutting processes on the fatigue properties of dentin. These findings are of substantial importance to the field of restorative dentistry, and potentially establish the need for treating senior patients with an approach that is unique from that of younger patients.

The accuracy for detecting mandibular condyle lesions was expressed as sensitivity, specificity, and validity values. Differences between the two radiographic modalities were tested by Wilcoxon for paired data tests. Inter-observer agreement was determined by Cohen′s Kappa. Results: The sensitivity, specificity and validity were 45 %, 85 % and 30 % in uncorrected sagittal tomographic images, respectively, and 70 %, 92. 5 % and 60 % in corrected sagittal tomographic images, respectively. There was a significant statistical difference between the accuracy of uncorrected and corrected sagittal tomography in detection of mandibular condyle erosions (P = 0. 016). The inter-observer agreement was slight for uncorrected sagittal tomography and moderate for corrected sagittal tomography. Conclusion: The accuracy of corrected sagittal tomography is significantly higher than that of uncorrected sagittal tomography. Therefore, corrected sagittal tomography seems to be a better modality in detection of mandibular condyle erosions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{increase}} enamel removal rate of <b>dental</b> diamond <b>bur</b> used in ultrasonic system so as to realize and promote its clinical applications. The cutting performances of the burs made by the electroplated diamond and by the chemical vapor deposition diamond (CVDD) are compared by experiment. It is found that the CVDD bur can achieve a higher removal rate. Detailed observation of the microphotograph of cut surface reveals that the superior performance of the CVDD bur is related to the morphology of the CVDD bur and the chips it produced. There are large amount of small cutting edges on the top of large size diamonds of the CVDD burs which results in tiny cutting chips. The materials along the plowed grooves left by the large size diamonds are removed by the adjacent small cutting edges. This action enables the cutting process to be carried out continuously rather than clogging the downward movement of the tool as experienced by the use of the electroplated diamond bur. But on the other hand, the too small chips also restrict the enamel removal rate. Hence a novel design of improved CVDD bur with fewer small cutting edges is proposed. The amount of cutting edges is reduced by heating the existing bur at 700 °C for various time periods. It is found that the enamel removal rate along and perpendicular to enamel prism directions can be increased by 60 % and 30 %, respectively as compared with the untreated CVDD bur when it is heated in the nitrogen environment for 10 minutes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractForeign bodies {{found in}} the maxillary sinus include tooth roots, <b>burs,</b> <b>dental</b> {{impression}} material, root-filling materials, dental implants, and needles. The {{purpose of this paper}} was to present an unusual case of a large foreign body of endodontic origin (root-filling material) removed from the maxillary sinus. A 45 -year-old generally healthy male patient reported to the Department of Conservative Dentistry with Endodontics of the Medical University of Silesia, because of orbital and buccal pain {{on the right side of}} his face and headaches in the preceding 6 months. Those symptoms were associated with the end of endodontic treatment of teeth 14 and 16. Periapical X-rays, including of teeth 14 and 16, showed the presence of root canal filling with extrusion of endodontic obturation material beyond the apices of tooth 14. In the case of tooth 16, a completely filled palatal canal and incompletely filled buccal canals were found. There was also an irregular dimness at the upper edge of the X-ray image. Panoramic radiography and computed tomography demonstrated a foreign body in the right sinus. Sinus exploration was performed via a surgical procedure conducted using topical anesthesia. The root apices of tooth 14 were resected, and foreign substance was removed. The practitioner did not correctly recognize a complication that occurred during endodontic treatment, which resulted in extrusion of endodontic material beyond the root apices of tooth 14. This case emphasizes the potential impact that an involved maxillary sinus may have on endodontic therapy. Detailed diagnostic identification based on the medical interview, physical and histopathological examinations, and diagnostic imaging allowed rapid surgical intervention and prevented local and general complications. It is important to realize that the range of the periapical X-ray projection is not always sufficient...|$|R
40|$|Carisolv® (MediTeam, Gøteborg, Sweden) is {{a product}} marketed to {{dissolve}} carious dentin thus enabling minimal invasive treatment of dental caries. Studies have reported antibacterial effect {{of the first generation}} of Carisolv. Recently the second generation (Carisolv- 2) was introduced. No information has been published about the antimicrobial effect of Carisolv- 2. Aims: 1. To assess in vitro the in situ antimicrobial effect of the Carisolv- 2 system on the bacteria in carious lesions. 2. To compare the type and quantity of bacteria from non-carious dentin treated by conventional drilling or by the Carisolv- 2 system. 3. To evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the Carisolv- 2 gel on selected cariogenic bacteria. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four extracted permanent teeth with caries (class I and II) not involving the pulp were collected after the patients’ consent and used in the study. Immediately after extraction and before Carisolv- 2 application, one carious dentin sample was obtained from each of the lesions (samples 1) using slowly rotating sterile round burs. The teeth were then split aseptically in two halves along their long axis and through the middle of the carious lesions. The caries lesions of the two halves (n= 48) were treated either with the Carisolv- 2 system or by conventional drilling using sterile <b>burs.</b> <b>Dental</b> probes and a KaVo DIAGNOdent® laser apparatus were used to assess when caries-free dentin had been reached. Then, non-carious dentin was obtained in a standardized manner by sterile round burs {{from the bottom of the}} cavities after all carious dentin had been removed by drilling (samples 2) or Carisolv- 2 treatment (samples 3). The dentin samples were weighed on a microscale balance and kept frozen in Greave’s medium until cultured aerobically and anaerobically on nonselective (blood agar) and on selective media (MS agar, Rogosa agar and CFAT agar). Although approximately the same volume of dentin was collected for each sample, the weight was slightly different. On an average the weight of the carious dentin samples was 0. 15 mg/ml and that of the non-carious samples 0. 20 mg/ml (p< 0. 01). Total and selective bacterial counts were calculated as colony forming units (cfu) per mg dentin. Bacterial speciation was based on growth on the selective media, biochemical tests for L. acidophilus and A. naeslundi and simple or nested PCR for S. mutans and S. sobrinus. Results: Samples 2 and samples 3 showed significantly (p< 0. 01) lower cfu/mg dentin counts on all culture media than did samples 1. Cfu/mg dentin of samples 3 were significantly (p< 0. 05) lower than those of samples 2, a difference most pronounced for anaerobic blood agar counts and CFAT counts. The Carisolv- 2 gel inhibited the growth of all the cariogenic bacteria tested (S. mutans, S. sobrinus, L. acidophilus, A. naeslundi) with inhibition zones in the range of 16. 5 - 35. 0 mm and for A. naeslundi from 32. 0 to 35. 0 mm. Conclusion: Treatment of carious lesions by the Carisolv- 2 system significantly reduced the bacteria in the adjacent non-carious dentin as compared to non-carious dentin obtained from lesions treated by drilling. The gel is the antimicrobial agent of the Carisolv- 2 system...|$|R
