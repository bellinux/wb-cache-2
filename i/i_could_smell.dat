60|$|Dick {{stared at}} the old hunter and {{likewise}} sniffed. I followed their lead, but all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> was the thick, piney odor of the forest.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> like him," [...] {{the captain}} said to the mate, [...] "there wouldn't be any risk at all of my ever losing my head." ...|$|E
60|$|Already <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> {{the smoke}} that was {{pouring out of}} the cracks around the hatchway. It {{would not be a}} great while before the entire vessel would be consumed.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>smelled</b> the new-mown hay if it wasn't {{that when}} you're in Geisenheimer's {{you have to}} smell Geisenheimer's, because it leaves no chance for competition.|$|R
6000|$|... "I call it doosid stale old rappee," [...] says Mr. Brummell--(as for me <b>I</b> declare <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>smell</b> {{anything}} at all in either of the boxes.) [...] "Old boy in smock-frock, take a pinch?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Move not," [...] whispered Dick. [...] "We {{are in the}} plaguiest pass, thanks, {{before all}} things, to thy swinishness of yestereven. When ye saw me here, so strangely seated where I have neither right nor interest, what a murrain <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ye not <b>smell</b> harm and get ye gone from evil?" ...|$|R
60|$|He was {{so close}} that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> him. His quick little eyes snapped fire and fear at once; he uttered a sound that was between a whine and a growl.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a shame!" [...] he said, {{bending down}} to stroke {{her hand and}} her arm. She drew back smiling, {{flushing}} with joy. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the white lilies where I sat.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the raw whiskey on the mate's breath. Yet {{he did not}} stagger nor {{show any}} signs of intoxication. Not until {{afterward}} was I to know that his willingness to talk was most unwonted and was where the liquor gave him away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep a tight line!" [...] I cautioned, as I {{backed the}} canoe hard {{with all my}} power. It {{was not easy to}} go {{backward}} and keep head on to the wind. The waves broke over the end of the canoe, splashing me in the face so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> taste and <b>smell</b> the salt. I made half a dozen shoves with the paddle. Then, nearing the piece of seaweed, I dropped my anchor.|$|R
5000|$|Rudd {{became a}} {{vegetarian}} after passing Harris Ranch, California's largest factory farm, during a United States tour. Rudd described {{in an interview}} with PETA how the experience made him change his diet, saying: [...] animals stood crammed together on this piece of land. They could hardly move as the area was too small for all those animals. Plus, they'd already eaten or trampled down the grass and all the feces were just left there. They were standing in their own waste and—what I found worse—even had to eat it because the workers didn't offer them anything else. I asked the driver about it and he said, [...] "Well, that's California's biggest beef producer." [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> still <b>smell</b> it after we had driven for another 30 kilometers. That was when I knew it was the right choice to go vegetarian.|$|R

6000|$|... "Poisoned with gases, I suppose," [...] Meyer {{answered}} with a groan, for his head was aching sadly. [...] "The air is often bad {{at the bottom of}} deep wells, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> or feel nothing until suddenly my senses left me. It was a near thing--a very near thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had fever, you know, but {{the thing}} was remarkably real. It was like lantern {{pictures}} melting on the screen. Background and figures were accurate and lifelike. In the last scene, I knew I was in Columbine's cabin and can hardly persuade myself I was quite asleep. The tide splashed about the boat; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the mud." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{mile and}} a half it must have been to our journey's end. I could hear nothing but the fearful rattle of the ancient hack over the uneven brick paving; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> nothing but the drizzle, now further flavored with coal smoke and {{something}} like a mixture of tar and oleander blossoms. All I could see through the streaming windows were two rows of dim houses.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the unit}} was {{originally}} {{located in the}} top floor of 'F' block patients often used to complain that they <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> beer and think that they were going mad. Little did they know that [...] "The Bees Knees" [...] pub was in located nearby in the basement below 'G' block - They really <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the beer.|$|R

50|$|Preston {{claimed that}} his dog <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> human traces years or {{months after a}} suspect walked over the ground, on heavily trafficked streets, or both. He claimed that his dog <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> underwater, and, in a case against {{a man who was}} {{eventually}} freed on DNA evidence, Preston claimed that his dog could track a human scent even after hurricanes. Tracking dog experts say these feats are impossible.|$|R
60|$|Once {{more she}} leaned towards me. The {{wind was blowing}} around us, she came closer as though seeking for the shelter of my body. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the crushed violets, which she was still wearing at her bosom; her eyes were soft and bright, her lips were {{slightly}} parted. I took her into my arms--she clung {{to me for a}} moment--one long, delicious moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Miss Patsey!" [...] she said, [...] "If you'd been a-coming to me {{with them}} violets and buttercups, instead of old Hans with his nasty bitter yarbs, I'd a been off that bed many a day ago. There was nothing but darkness, and the shadows of tomb-stones, and the damp smells of the lonely bogs about his roots and his leaves. But there was the heavenly {{sunshine}} in your flowers, Miss Patsey, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the sweet fields, when I looked at them, and hear {{the hum of the}} bees!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{picked up}} a school of mullet before I'd been rowing five minutes. Fine big fat ones they were, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> them over the fire. When I stood up, fire-stick in one hand, {{dynamite}} stick in the other, my knees were knocking together. Maybe it was the gin, or the anxiousness, or the weakness and the hunger, and {{maybe it was the}} result of all of them, but at any rate I was all of a shake. Twice I failed to touch the fire-stick to the dynamite. Then I did, heard the match-head splutter, and let her go.|$|E
60|$|All at {{once there}} was a sound like a tiny muffled {{explosion}} and the cover lifted right up on a level plane a few inches; there was no mistaking anything now, for the whole room was full of a blaze of light. Then the cover, staying fast at one side rose slowly up on the other, as though yielding to some pressure of balance. The coffer still continued to glow; from it began to steal a faint greenish smoke. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>smell</b> it fully on account of the respirator; but, even through that, I was conscious of a strange pungent odour. Then this smoke began to grow thicker, and to roll out in volumes of ever increasing density till the whole room began to get obscure. I had a terrible desire to rush over to Margaret, whom I saw through the smoke still standing erect behind the couch. Then, as I looked, I saw Doctor Winchester sink down. He was not unconscious; for he waved his hand back and forward, as though to forbid any one to come to him. At this time the figures of Mr. Trelawny and Mr. Corbeck were becoming indistinct in the smoke which rolled round them in thick billowy clouds. Finally I lost sight of them altogether. The coffer still continued to glow; but the lamps began to grow dim. At first I thought that their light was being overpowered by the thick black smoke; but presently I saw that they were, one by one, burning out. They must have burned quickly to produce such fierce and vivid flames.|$|R

6000|$|... "I took up {{my rifle}} again. It comforted {{me to see}} what a small jump the beast had made {{compared}} to our distance from the ground. Again I fired, and this time also I did not hit him. I had never practised shooting at things almost beneath me; the slightest motion of Irene disturbed my aim. The report seemed to infuriate the tiger until he {{was on the verge of}} madness. He jumped from side to side, he roared, he gnashed his teeth, and it seemed to me that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> his horrid breath coming up toward us.|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} ago one of the six-story {{clothing}} stores along here had the space inside its plate-glass show-window partition'd into a little corral, and litter'd deeply with rich clover and hay, (<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the odor outside,) on which reposed two magnificent fat sheep, full-sized but young--the handsomest creatures of the kind I ever saw. I stop's long and long, with the crowd, to view them--one lying down chewing the cud, and one standing up, looking out, with dense-fringed patient eyes. Their wool, of a clear tawny color, with streaks of glistening black--altogether a queer sight amidst that crowded promenade of dandies, dollars and dry-goods.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hopped along {{home with}} my ears well back over my {{shoulders}} so I could hear if anybody was after me, and was thinking what a nice time I'd have with some of Mr. Man's carrots that I'd brought in the day before, when what should I stumble over but {{a place on the}} moss which looked as if there'd been mischief of some kind done there lately. I had an idea <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> blood ever so faintly, but even then I didn't suspect anything was wrong at home till I crept in through the hallway, and there was poor little Sonny Bunny all curled up as if he'd been tied in a knot, while his mother was washing the blood spots off his coat.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Everything,' he said, {{his face}} muffled in the {{shoulder}} of her dress. He <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> her fresh and fine from the sea. 'Everything!' he said.|$|R
50|$|The sailors used {{to consume}} opium and alcohol, {{because in the}} nineteenth century, opium is legally consumed. Passersby <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> opium when near the Sailor's home.|$|R
60|$|But they didn't. The Leopard and the Ethiopian hunted all day; {{and though}} they <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> them and hear them, they never saw one of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't dare even to {{wait long}} enough to quiet Mrs. Bunny, but off I ran through the hallway, which is very long in our house, as you may suppose, and before {{reaching}} the door <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> Mr. Foxy Fox as plainly as I smell you this minute. Frightened? It seemed as if I couldn't put one paw before another, and {{for two or three}} minutes it looked as if I'd go home for supper with Mr. Fox. How {{he got out of the}} scrape with the 'Squire and Mr. Weasel I couldn't guess, except that those two were so busy with each other that he contrived to slip off quietly; but it didn't make very much difference to me just how it happened, for I had troubles of my own to look after.|$|E
60|$|I trembled as I {{heard the}} words. If a horse should neigh or make any noise {{that could be}} heard above the hiss of the rain! I did not dare to move for fear lest I should betray myself. There I stood {{so close to the}} Kaffirs that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> them and hear the rain pattering on their bodies. Only very stealthily I drew my hunting knife with my right hand. At that moment the lightning, which I thought had quite gone by, flashed again for the last time, {{revealing}} the fat face of the Basuto captain within a foot of my own, for he was turned towards the wall on which one of his hands rested. Moreover, the blue and ghastly light revealed mine to him thrust forward between the two stones, my eyes glaring at him.|$|E
60|$|Well, I was smarting under a {{sense of}} defeat. Undeserved defeat, but what of that? That didn't soften the smart any. And {{to think of the}} circumstances! the first statesman of the age, the capablest man, the best-informed man in the entire world, the loftiest uncrowned head that had moved through the clouds of any {{political}} firmament for centuries, sitting here apparently defeated in argument by an ignorant country blacksmith! And I could see that those others were sorry for me--which made me blush till <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> my whiskers scorching. Put yourself in my place; feel as mean as I did, as ashamed as I felt--wouldn't you have struck below the belt to get even? Yes, you would; it is simply human nature. Well, that is what I did. I am not trying to justify it; I'm only saying that I was mad, and anybody would have done it.|$|E
50|$|The Sarson's Vinegar factory was {{situated}} in Tanner Street in Bermondsey, London, {{on the southern}} approach to Tower Bridge, where you <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the aroma of the vinegar.|$|R
5000|$|The Apollo 17 {{crew members}} recalled: [...] "You {{knew that you}} were in a very heavily {{infiltrated}} atmosphere in the LM because of the lunar dust"; [...] "the dust clearing was remarkable considering the amount of dust we had"; [...] "although {{there was a lot of}} irritation to my sinuses and nostrils soon after taking the helmet off, by 2 hours that had decreased considerably"; [...] "I did all the transfer with my helmet off and I am sorry I did because the dust really bothered my eyes and throat. I was tasting it and eating it"; and [...] "when I climbed in the tunnel <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell there was a lot of dust in the LM and you <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> it".|$|R
