40|$|The {{number of}} {{saprophytic}} bacteria {{and the presence}} of some physiological groups of bacteria were examined in the supplying waters of Plitvice Lakes, as well as in some of the Upper and Lower lakes. The investigations were carried out in the autumn 1977, and in the spring and autumn 1978. One of the main supplying waters of Lake Prošćan, the Crna rijeka, does not display signs of pollution, while the Bijela rijeka — following bacteriological parameters (Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens) is constantly polluted by domestic waste waters. The presence and a more significant representation of the groups of proteolytic and phosphomineralizing bacteria than {{in other parts of the}} examined region, point not only at the enlarged concentrations of organic nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds in the river water, but also at a possibility of hastening the processes of <b>eutrophization,</b> as the result of their mineralization. Concequently, the water of the Bijela rijeka which after joining the Crna rijeka flown into Lake Prošćan as Matica, would be one of the important factors for speeding the <b>eutrophization</b> processes in the lake, especially in the zone of the river mouth. (Table 2, 3). Relatively low values of all the groups of bacteria were found in the upper and lower lakes, which can be the result of dilution of more polluted supplying waters and the processes of selfpurification. The mean values of number of saprophytic bacteria on MPA in the lakes ranged from 225 (in spring) to 1. 480 (in autumn) in 1 ml, which would correspond to I—II class of bonity or oligo-betamesosaprobic level after Kohl (1975). The number of bacteria of the investigated groups increased considerably in autumn, probably as a result of larger quantities of dead organic matter in the water of the lakes (Table 4). The bacteriological analysis of samples of shallow water from the littoral of Lake Galovac, where a thick layer of fallen leaves and reed stems decayed (autumn 1978), showed high numbers of bacteria of all groups, which is a sign of intensive decomposition and mineralization of dead plant material.

40|$|<b>Eutrophization</b> {{of aquatic}} {{ecosystems}} {{due to high}} phosphorus concentrations is associated with algal blooms which lead to poor water quality (Ribeiro et al, 2008; Martins et al, 2008). Processes used in remediation of water bodies include removal of P from the water column by precipitation and P inactivation in sediments (sediment capping). Remediation solutions have been tested {{for a long time}} but with limited success. Chemical precipitation of P with aluminium, iron, and calcium salts added to the water column has several disadvantages, namely is inadequate to remove low concentrations of phosphorus, contaminates water with high concentrations of sulphate and chloride ions, and generates large quantities of flocs that settle to the sediment (Ramm and Scheps, 1997; Lijklema et al, 1993; Jin et al, 2006). A sediment capping layer would remain in place indefinitely, unless disturbed by ebullition of sediment gases or some major seismic or climatic disturbance. Potential problems with sediment capping are bioturbation and wave action (Hano et al, 1997; Donnert and Salecker 1999). For this reasons, we propose a new method for phosphorus removal based in polyolefins activated with a sequestering agent (Al 2 O 3) ...|$|E

To characterize the seasonal and geographical variation of pollutant concentrations and to improve the empirical understanding of the influence of Mediterranean broadleaf evergreen forests on air quality, four forests of Quercus ilex (three peri-urban and one remote) were monitored in different areas in Spain. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), ammonia (NH₃), nitric acid (HNO₃) and ozone (O₃) were measured during 2 years in open areas and inside the forests and aerosols (PM₁₀) were monitored in open areas during 1 year. Ozone was the only air pollutant expected to have direct phytotoxic effects on vegetation according to current thresholds for the protection of vegetation. The concentrations of N compounds were not high enough to directly affect vegetation but could be contributing through atmospheric N deposition to the <b>eutrophization</b> of these ecosystems. Peri-urban forests of Q. ilex showed a significant below-canopy reduction of gaseous concentrations (particularly NH₃, with a mean reduction of 29 - 38 %), which indicated the feasibility of these forests to provide an ecosystem service of air quality improvement.

The aim was to investigate the temporal and spatial variability of water quality. Data investigation was processed using multivariate analysis/cluster analysis and GIS techniques. Samples were taken in four stations spreading out over the water body during five campaigns of collection (February, May, August/ 2007 and May, August/ 2008). The water quality parameters analyzed were: Electric Conductivity (EC), pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), temperature, chlorophyll 'a' concentration and Total Phosphorus (TP). Two homogeneous groups were identified, which expressed the inter-annual seasonality influence in the water quality. The highest concentration of investigated attributes occurred in 2008. At that year, the depth of the annual rainfall was 53 % above the annual average. Chlorophyll 'a' and total phosphorus defined the dissimilarity between the two groups. Group 1 was composed with the better water quality and concentrations of attributes were close to the recommended limit defined by resolution 357 / 05 of CONAMA.

Valencia, 28 March- 1 April, 2000 The Chafarinas {{islands are}} located in the West End of the Mediterranean Sea, near (3. 5 km) to the Moroccan coast. The islands have a {{volcanic}} origin, being the dominant parent rocks andesite and basalt, partly covered by an eroded calcareous crust. The steeped slopes and the dry climate (about 250 mm of mean annual rainfall) are responsible for the shallow « 50 cm) soils and for the aridic soil moisture regime (Lithic Torriorthents dominates). Chafarinas islands support {{one of the most important}} nesting colonies of Audouin's gull (Larus audounil), arare Mediterranean seabird. These breeding sites have been legally protected, since 1982, to avoid the gathering of eggs and other human interference that limited the growth of gull populations. In turn, the protection of the area has favoured the expansion of the more common, yellow-Iegged, seagull (Larus cachinans). The effects of such a high density of both seagulls' species on soil chemical & physical properties have become significant. On the other hand, the uncontrolled proliferation of domestic rabbits in the biggest (Congreso) island has had remarkable negative effects on herbaceous communities, shrub seedlings and in soil degradation. The Spanish Ministry for the environment, concerned about soil and plant cover conservation in the islands, has supported a research project whose preliminary findings are presented here. The presence and abundance of gulls correlated significantly to changes in chemical (nutrients, salinity, ionic ratios, organic matter, pHI and physical (bulk density, moisture retention capacity) soil properties which, in turn, were related to changes in plant cover, biomass and species composition. A model for soil-plants-fulls/rabbits interaction is proposed. Guano influence in soil properties and the associated changes in relevant plant community parameters (abundance, diversity of the shrub and herbaceous strata, above ground biomass, and soil seed bank) are quantitatively analysed.

As a consequence, there is an increasing number of environmental documents and institutional acts on this topic that demonstrate the need for greener approaches in the area of construction engineering. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the environmental impact of the Italian gray cement and clinker industry, after distinguishing between the upstream and the core phases of these processes. The study considered clinker and cement generated during 2014 in eleven Italian plants that produced materials complying with the European standard EN 197 - 1 “Cement - Part 1 : Composition, specifications and conformity criteria for common cements”. The environmental assessment was conducted through a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of these industrial processes, following the standard EN 15804 “Sustainability of construction works, environmental product declarations, core rules for the product category of construction products” and the Product Category Rules (PCR) 2010 : 09 version 2. 1 “Cement”. The results permitted to construct the first sector Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) related to cement production published until now by the International EPD System. The analysis of the results demonstrated that among the different phases involved in the production process of these materials (i. e. extraction and production of raw materials and fuels, transportation and core production process), the core phase is responsible for most of the greenhouse emissions (i. e. more than 85 % of the total process for clinker, and more than 79 % of the total process for cement), and the acidification and <b>eutrophization</b> potential (i. e. 43 % and 62 % of the total process for clincker, and 33 % and 55 % of the total process for cement). It was also found that the cement production is mainly responsible for the following environmental impact categories: the overall electrical consumption required as part of these industrial processes (116 kWh/Mg), the output flows of components for re-use and materials for recycling (0. 21 and 0. 17 kg/Mg, respectively), and the biogenic CO 2 emissions (16 kg/Mg).

40|$|A oferta de água vem se tornando cada vez mais diminuta à medida que a população, a indústria e a agricultura se expandem. A contaminação dos mananciais gerada pelo descarte de efluentes domésticos e industriais leva a eutrofização, processo pela qual grande aporte de nutrientes, particularmente fosfatos, leva ao crescimento excessivo de algas. As cianobactérias são microrganismos procariontes, que vivem nos ambientes mais adversos. A floração dessas algas quando presente em mananciais destinados ao consumo humano gera sérios problemas à saúde humana, pois algumas dessas algas podem gerar toxinas, conhecidas como hepatotoxinas, neurotoxinas e dermatotoxinas, de acordo com sua ação farmacológica. Dentre as hepatotoxinas encontramos a microcistina, um heptapeptídeo cíclico que pode levar à morte em horas ou dias. O objetivo desse estudo foi viabilizar a técnica HPLC, já proposta por outros autores, para quantificar microcistinas-LR em reservatórios de água, em escala empresarial para ser implementada em laboratórios de análise de águas. Para o desenvolvimento da técnica, foram utilizadas amostras de uma lagoa com floração de Microcystis. Para determinar a eficiência da técnica cromatográfica, foram realizados estudos com outro método, através do kit ELISA. Nessa etapa do trabalho, verificou-se que a técnica HPLC é mais sensível e viável para a quantificação das microcistinas. Nos experimentos realizados com a cromatografia líquida, observou-se que a coluna C- 18 LiChrosorb (25 cm) 7 Sm utilizada no método, e o solvente metanol apresentaram grande influência nos resultados. À medida que os experimentos foram executados, verificou-se o decréscimo da sensibilidade da coluna. Os resultados foram satisfatórios apenas após a limpeza realizada na coluna, onde os padrões apresentaram uma curva de correlação igual a 0, 92. Este fato leva a concluir que as colunas precisam ser renovadas para análises mais sensíveis, como no caso das microcistinas. As amostras extraídas com metanol apresentaram resultados relevantes, isto é, quanto maior a concentração de metanol utilizado na extração, maior a concentração de microcistina-LR obtida nos resultados, concluindo o metanol ser o solvente apropriado para a extração. Por fim, conclui-se que o método desenvolvido é viável, apresentando algumas dificuldades para sua implantação em escala empresarial. The {{water supply}} has been {{decreasing}} {{more and more}} as the population, industry and agriculture expand. The contamination of the water sources generated by the domestic and industrial effluents discharges leads to the <b>eutrophization,</b> process where the large presence of nutrients, particularly phosphates, causes excessive increase of algae. The cyanobacteria are procaryote microorganisms which live in the most diverse environments. The florescence of the algae when present in sources directed to human consumption generates serious problems to the human health, for some of them may produce toxins known as hepatotoxins, neurotoxins and dermotoxins, according to their pharmacological action. Among the hepatotoxins, the microcystin, a cyclic heptapeptide that can lead to death in hours or days, is found. The objective {{of this study was to}} make feasible the use of the HPLC technique, already proposed by other authors, to quantify microcystins-LR in water reservoirs, in enterprise scale to be implemented in water analysis laboratories. In order to develop the technique, samples of water from a pond with Microcystis florescence were utilized. To evaluate the efficiency of the chromatographic technique, studies were performed with another method, through the ELISA kit. In this phase of the work, it was verified that the HPLC technique is the most sensible and viable for the quantification of the microcystins. It was observed, in the experiments performed with the liquid chromatography, that the column C- 18 LiChrosorb (25 cm) 7 Sm utilized in the method and the methanol solvent presented great influence in the results. As the experiments were realized, the decrease of the sensibility of the column was verified. The results were satisfactory only after the column being cleaned, when the patterns presented a curve of correlation equal to 0. 92. This fact leads to the conclusion that the columns need to be renewed for more sensible analysis, like in the case of the microcystins. The samples extracted with methanol presented relevant results, that is, the greater the concentration of the methanol utilized, the higher the concentration of microcystin-LR obtained in the results, leading to the conclusion that methanol was the solvent adequate to the extraction. Finally, it was concluded that the method developed is feasible, presenting some difficulties concerning its implantation in enterprise scale...|$|E

AbstractLake of Guadalupe is {{a reservoir}} {{located in the}} neighborhood of Mexico City, and {{it is one of the}} few relicts still remaining in the basin of Mexico. This reservoir receives an important volume of waste waters from its surroundings which include urban, forested, recreational and agricultural sites. In this work we present a spectral analysis of this lake utilizing spot imagery and in situ data and the its Trophic State Index (tsi). Measurements were carried out in February and September of 2006. Measured variables include temperature, pH, chlorophyll a, Secchi transparency and quasi-simultaneous satellite data from spot images. Variables were measured at seven sampling sites, strategically located along the lake. This water body has eutrophic characteristics, it has basic pH valúes (6. 8 - 11. 3), high chlorophyll a concentrations (6. 9 - 112. 4 μg 1 - 1) andlow valúes of Secchi transparency. Thermally, the lake is warm monomictic. Results indícate a high degree of <b>eutrophization</b> of the Lake of Guadalupe, due, mainly, to the presence of phytoplankton and submerged and floating vegetation. The presence of aquatic vegetation such as hyacinth and duckweed is apparent at the edge of the lake. In February, the concentration of Chlorophyll a, expressed as biomass, was homogenous in the reservoir with a mean of 9. 56 ± 4. 26 mg m- 3. The mean valué for Secchi transparency was 3. 39 (± 1. 13) ni, which corresponds to an Extinction Coefficient K= 0. 50 m- 1 associated to turbid waters. The pH average of 10. 40 indicates alkaline conditions. The TSI, estimated from Secchi transparency was 43. 50 (± 6. 9) indicative of meso-trophic waters, whilst the TSI, estimated for chlorophyll a was 52. 16 (± 3. 35) corresponds to eutrophic waters characterized by the presence of microphytes. In September the concentration of chlorophyll a had a wide range of values with a mean of 72. 90 (± 28. 46) mg m- 3, which clearly indicates hyper-eutrophic waters. Secchi Transparency La averaged 60. 29 (± 0. 22) cm, with an Extinction Coefficient K= 2. 82 m- 1. The TSI for this variable was 68. 13 (± 5. 32) indicative of hyper-eutrophized waters and suggesting anoxic hypolimnia. the TSI estimated from the concentration of chlorophyll a was 71. 86 (± 4. 62) which is a referent of hyper-eutrophized waters as well. Surface temperature of the reservoir changed from 18. 1 in February to 23 in September, pH varied from an alkaline condition > 9 in February to a slightly acid pH of 6. 8 in September. Chlorophyll a concentration confirm the eutrophication of the dam. Values higher than 5 μgl- 1 indícate eutrophic conditions, while those higher than 40 μgl- 1 indícate a high hypertrophic environment. In this work, chlorophyll values varied from 6. 9 μgl- 1 to an a hyper-trophic value of 112. 4 μgl- 1. Water coloration allowed for the selection of an appropriate spectral spot band. The high amount of phytoplankton in the reservoir is useful for a better satellite image interpretation. The use of remote sensed imagery helps for a better monitoring of water quality along with a suitable field work...|$|E

The main aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the assessment of the environmental effect of the city and industry in Skawina. Skawina is a town with a population of 25, 000 situated about 15 km to the south-west of Kraków (S Poland). The main industrial facilities, located in the western part of the city, include: a coal-fired electric power plant, Lajkonik Snacks S. A. (food industry), the Vesuvius refractory ceramics factory and about 50 smaller industrial entities. Until 1980 s of last century, one of the largest Polish aluminum smelters was operating in the western part of town. In 1981 the electrolysis department was closed due to huge emission of lethal fluorine, which was the major source of air, soil and water pollution in the area. It is hypothesized here that current environmental problems in the area result from contemporary and local urban or industrial activities rather than from historical pollution. Skawina is located at the junction of transit routes. The prevailing winds are SW and W bringing the air pollution from nearby Silesia. The town lies on the Skawinka River, a tributary to the Vistula River. Since the prevailing winds are SW and W, parallel to the river valley, temperature inversions and fogs are frequent. The Skawinka River is the source of city water for Skawina. In the lower part it receives a large volume of cooling water from the power plant. This is the Vistula River processed in the plant. It accepts municipal wastewater discharge too. Studies conducted in the 1970 s showed extremely high levels of SO 2 and particular matter in the atmosphere of Skawina. However, since the 1980 s, there has been a significant improvement in air quality following decreases of industrial emissions. According to the data from the air monitoring network in the Małopolska region (Małopolska Sieć Monitoringu Powietrza 2007) and reports by the Voivoidship Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Kraków (Wojewódzki Inspektorat Ochrony Środowiska w Krakowie 1994 – 2005), the improvement is observed for the whole Małopolska region. This study involved 10 soil samples from selected locations in the city of Skawina and 10 samples of water from the Skawinka River. The pH, loss of ignition and total elemental composition (using X-ray fluorescence XRF) was determined in soils. Bioavailability of selected elements was estimated based on extraction with HCl 1 M. The temperature, pH, electric conductivity, colour and turbidity, as well as concentration of major ions (using atomic absorption spectrometry AAS) were determined in waters. The results were compared with current standards and legal regulations regarding water and soil pollution in urban areas. In spring 2015, a soil sampling campaign is planned for determination of current fluorine content in soils around the former aluminum processing plant. The soils are typical for urban areas: rich in clay and silt and lacking horizontal stratification. The pH exhibits bimodal distribution with maximums around 5 and around 8. Alkaline pH correlates with higher lost of ignition (ca. 8 wt. %) indicating the presence of carbonate fraction. Total concentration of selected elements in soils (particularly Ba up to 850 ppm, Zn up to 390 ppm, Pb up to 157 ppm, Cr up to 300 ppm) exceeds 105 the limits of soil pollution in Poland. Therefore, the soils are classified as class pollution C typical for industrial zones according to Rozporządzenie Ministra Środowiska [...] . (2002). The bioavailability determined using HCl 1 M varies broadly and does not correlate with other parameters. This may indicate that bioavailable forms of metals are already complexed with organic components of the soil. The waters of the Skawinka River are strongly affected by the industry. All the physical and chemical parameters are strongly altered below the outlet of cooling water from the power plant. The plant uses water from the Wisła River. The discharge pollutes the waters of the Skawinka River mostly increasing the temperature (from 12 to 16 °C) and mineralization (conductivity increases from 560 to 1230 mS/cm). Increased mineralization results mostly from increase in NaCl salinity. This results in drastic increase in turbidity (from 7 to 27 NTU) due to <b>eutrophization.</b> The waters are classified as IInd class according to Rozporządzenie Ministra Środowiska [...] . (2011). Comparison of the results with previous studies indicates that the improvement of the state of the environment is small. This area was under heavy influence of various industry for many years resulting in strong deterioration of the soils. The waters of the Skawinka River are still under constant anthropogenic pressure. The results indicate that contamination of soils represents regional, long-range air pollution with historical component. The Skawinka River in turn, is under contemporary local environmental stress which should be improved particularly since recreational and sport facilities are developed on the river banks.

40|$|O processo de armazenamento de Ãgua em regiÃes semi-Ãridas tem se tornado um considerÃvel meio de reduzir a escassez deste recurso natural. Assim, Ã comum em regiÃes, com caracterÃsticas do Nordeste Brasileiro, a construÃÃo de grandes reservatÃrios, que tem servido para atender, com certa regularidade, demandas para os mais diversos usos. Por outro lado, o armazenamento de Ãgua em reservatÃrios acaba tornando essas massas lÃquidas vulnerÃveis a um maior risco de degradaÃÃo. Como se sabe, a Ãgua armazenada fica sujeito a longo tempo de residÃncia, permitindo assim com que algumas importantes reaÃÃes, tanto do ponto de vista quÃmico, como biolÃgico, possam ocorrer. Estas reaÃÃes, associadas com alguns lanÃamentos de efluentes, provenientes de zonas urbanas, Ãreas industriais e zonas rurais, acabam por acelerar o processo de envelhecimento dos reservatÃrios, conhecido como âprocesso de EutrofizaÃÃoâ, que depende, fundamentalmente, da disponibilidade de nutrientes no {{interior}} dos reservatÃrios. Este trabalho estudou, atravÃs de pesquisa de campo, associada com uma metodologia de cÃlculo de Ãndices de Estado TrÃfico Modificado e Ãndice de Qualidade de Ãgua, as condiÃÃes ambientais do ReservatÃrio Acarape do Meio, no Estado do CearÃ, na busca de uma identificaÃÃo das principais transformaÃÃes nos seus nÃveis trÃficos, bem como, na identificaÃÃo das principais causas de um possÃvel processo de eutrofizaÃÃo do mesmo. Para isso foram utilizados dados de campo em um perÃodo de 2001 a 2006, o que permitiu conhecer as caracterÃsticas pertinentes Ã estratificaÃÃo deste corpo hÃdrico, no que diz respeito Ã temperatura e a estratificaÃÃo quÃmica de suas Ãguas. TambÃm, tendo em vista os vÃrios pontos de coletas de dados, foi possÃvel apresentar resultados relativos ao Ãndice de Estado TrÃfico e ao Ãndice de Qualidade de Ãgua, em uma distribuiÃÃo espacial do reservatÃrio, mostrando, assim, os vÃrios pontos crÃticos do mesmo. Nas questÃes pertinentes ao Ãndice de Estado TrÃfico foram usados dois cÃlculos, sendo para o primeiro usado, apenas, a clorofila-a e o fÃsforo, enquanto que no segundo cÃlculo foram utilizados, alÃm dessas duas substÃncias, o ortofosfato solÃvel presente naquelas Ãguas. Os resultados mostram que hÃ uma forte variabilidade da qualidade das Ãguas deste reservatÃrio, mas que, nos anos de 2004 e 2005, suas Ãguas atingiram um nÃvel hipereutrÃfico, o que representa a presenÃa de um forte aporte de nutrientes provenientes das entradas do reservatÃrio e, provavelmente, das zonas rurais que existem em torno do mesmo. Os resultados mostraram ainda que, mesmo que a variaÃÃo vertical de temperatura nÃo seja tÃo significativa no interior do reservatÃrio, hÃ uma forte presenÃa de estratificaÃÃo quÃmica nas camadas mais profundas deste corpo hÃdrico. The {{process of}} {{storage of water}} in semi-arid regions has become a considerable way of reducing the shortage of this natural resource. Like this, it is common in areas with characteristics of the Brazilian Northeast, the construction of great reservoirs that has been being to assist, with certain regularity, demands for the most several uses. On the other hand, the storage of water in reservoirs bring some vulnerabilities to the water, concerning with the degradation risk. As it is known, the stored water is subject to long residence times, allowing the appearance of some important chemical and biological reactions. These reactions, associated with some sewage releases, that come from urban, industrial, and rural areas, promote the accelerating the process of aging of the reservoirs, known as Eutrophication Process, that depends, fundamentally, {{of the presence of}} nutrients inside the reservoirs. This work studied, through field data, associated with a methodology of calculation of Modified Trophic State Index and the Water Quality Index, the environmental conditions of the Acarape do Meio Reservoir, in the State of CearÃ, trying to identificaty the main transformations in their trophic levels, as well as, the identification of the main causes of a possible process of <b>eutrophization</b> of it. The data cover the years 2001 through 2006. With that, it was possible to know the characteristics concerning with the stratification this body of water, with respect to temperature and the chemical process. Also, considering the several points of collections of data, it was possible to present results concerning with the Trophic State Index and the Water Quality Index, a long of the all surface of the reservoir, showing, like this, the several critical points of it. With respect to the Trophic Level Index, two calculations were used, being for the first used, just, the chlorophyll a and the phosphors, while in the second calculation they were used, besides those two substances, the present soluble orthophosphate in those waters. The results show that there is a strong variability {{of the quality of the}} waters of this reservoir, but that, in the years of 2004 and 2005, their waters reached a hipereutrophic level, that represents the presence of a fort presence of nutrients coming of the entrances of the reservoir and, probably, of the rural areas that exist around the it. The results showed yet, even if the vertical variation of temperature is not so significant inside the reservoir, there is a strong presence of chemical stratification in the deepest layers of this body of water...|$|E
40|$|A poluiÃÃo {{ambiental}} Ã um dos grandes problemas nos paÃses desenvolvidos e em desenvolvimento. Isto Ã decorrente de uma sÃrie de fatores, como o despejo de efluentes nÃo tratados em corpos hÃdricos e a ineficiÃncia e/ou a falta de legislaÃÃo ambiental vigente. O objetivo principal deste trabalho Ã aplicar os processos foto-Fenton com irradiaÃÃo solar e/ou artificial, a tÃcnica da eletrofloculaÃÃo e a integraÃÃo destes processos no tratamento de efluente de curtume. Ambos os processos de tratamento do foto-Fenton e da eletrofloculaÃÃo foram conduzidos em reatores a escala laboratorial. Para a tÃcnica da eletrofloculaÃÃo foi utilizado um par de placas de alumÃnio como eletrodos no reator de eletrofloculaÃÃo. Para avaliar as melhores condiÃÃes de processo do sistema foto-Fenton, foi aplicado um planejamento experimental 33 completo. Para a tÃcnica da eletrofloculaÃÃo manteve-se constante a intensidade de corrente, pH inicial do efluente bruto e distÃncia entre os eletrodos, variando-se o tempo de eletrÃlise de 5 Ã 120 min. A eficiÃncia de ambos os processos foram avaliadas com base na reduÃÃo de Demanda quÃmica de oxigÃnio (DQO), cor, turbidez, sÃlidos totais (ST), sÃlidos totais fixos (STF), sÃlidos totais volÃteis (STV). Para a tÃcnica da eletrofloculaÃÃo e dos processos integrados tambÃm foram avaliados a reduÃÃo da concentraÃÃo dos metais pesados. Todas as medidas dos parÃmetros fÃsico-quÃmicos foram realizadas aplicando os mÃtodos padrÃes do Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater para amostra nÃo tratada e tratada. As concentraÃÃes dos metais pesados foram determinadas usando a tÃcnica de fluorescÃncia de raio X por reflexÃo total, na linha de Luz (D 09 -XRF) do LaboratÃrio Nacional de Luz Synchrotron. A maior eficiÃncia na reduÃÃo dos poluentes verificada no processo foto-Fenton foi de 98, 1, 96, 4, 98, 8, 71, 8, 32, 1 e 98, 5 para valores da DQO, cor, turbidez, ST, STF e STV, respectivamente, nas condiÃÃes operacionais do reator: concentraÃÃo de ferro de 0, 5 gL- 1, concentraÃÃo de perÃxido de hidrogÃnio de 30 gL- 1, pH inicial 3 e tempo reacional de 120 min. No entanto a tÃcnica da eletrofloculaÃÃo nÃo apresentou boa reduÃÃo nos valores dos parÃmetros fÃsico-quÃmicos. ApÃs a aplicaÃÃo dos processos integrados do foto-Fenton com irradiaÃÃo solar e da eletrofloculaÃÃo em tempo de eletrÃlise de 15 min, foi alcanÃado valores mÃnimos de Cr e DQO no efluente tratado, contendo 0, 24 mg Cr L- 1 e 107 mg O 2 L- 1 da DQO. O custo do tratamento do efluente e da disposiÃÃo final do lodo gerado no processo integrado FFs&# 8594;EF foi de R$ 56, 30 m 3 do efluente de curtume tratado. Este processo integrado reduziu as concentraÃÃes de cromo, ferro e DQO, a nÃveis permitidos pelas legislaÃÃes ambientais. Baseada na reduÃÃo da matÃria orgÃnica e inorgÃnica, o mÃtodo integrado FFs&# 8594;EF pode ser recomendado como uma substituiÃÃo eficiente ao mÃtodo individual. Pollution is a currently {{environmental problem}} of world concern. There are many {{events such as}} the discharging of untreated effluents in watercourses that cause the <b>eutrophization</b> of water bodies and bad water quality, as well as an inefficiency or lack of a current environmental law. The main goal of this dissertation was the application of solar and artificial-based photo-Fenton processes and aluminum electrodes-based electrocoagulation method in non coupled mode and in an integrated mode for the tannery effluent treatment. These effluent treatments were carried out in lab-scale reactors. In order to evaluate the performance of the reactor experimental conditions of photo-Fenton reactor, a 33 complete experimental design was performed. The lab scale EC reactor was operated at the 4 A electrical current, 4 cm electrode distance and 3 initial pH optimized values, according to the previous results obtained in another work, while the electrolysis time was varied from 5 to 120 min. For EC and photo-Fenton reactors, their performance was evaluated on the removal values of chemical oxygem demand (COD), color, turbidity, total solids (TS), total fixed solids (TFS), total volatile solids (TVS) and metal concentration. Measurements of physico-chemical parameters for untreated and treated effluent samples were performed applying the Standard Method for water analysis, while metal concentrations were determined by the Synchrotron radiation total Reflexion X-ray Fluorescence technique at Brazilian Light Synchrotron Laboratory. By an optimized photon-Fenton process at 0. 5 g Fe 2 + L- 1, 30 g H 2 O 2 L- 1, 3 initial pH, and 120 min reaction time, tannery effluent was treated achieving a high performance in pollutant removal as reported by 98. 1, 96. 4, 98. 8, 71. 8, 32. 1 and 98. 5 percent removal for COD, color, turbidity, TS, TFS, and TVS, respectively. As a primer treatment stage, electrocoagulation technique was not achieved a well successful result based on the physico-chemical parameter values reduction as compared with photo-Fenton process. However, an integrated solar irradiation-based photo-Fenton and Al electrodes-based electrocoagulation with 15 min electrolysis time has achieved recommended values by the Brazilian environmental law for Cr concentration (0. 24 mg Cr L- 1) and DQO (107 mg O 2 L- 1). Considering both the costs of electrical energy and material and the generated sludge discharging, one m 3 of tannery effluent should cost R$ 56. 30 for a treatment system based on an integrated and optimized photoâFenton and electrocoagulation processes. Finally, the integrated solar-based photo Fenton and electrocoagulation method is suggested as an efficient one, instead to apply a unique process...|$|E
