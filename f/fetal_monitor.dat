30|$|In {{clinical}} practice, however, it is {{not always}} possible to obtain MHR recordings with ECG during labour, because many <b>fetal</b> <b>monitors</b> do not incorporate this technology, and some healthcare professionals and laboring women think it is unnecessary and interferes with the physiological experience of childbirth. Alternatively, MHR can be obtained with a pulse oximetry sensor and photoplethysmography (PPG), using monitors that have been integrated or are coupled to <b>fetal</b> <b>monitors.</b> Continuous monitoring of maternal oxygen saturation is required in some clinical situations during labor, and some women find it more comfortable than chest electrodes. Moreover, some <b>fetal</b> <b>monitors</b> have recently incorporated pulse oximetry into the tocodynomometer sensor, so MHR can be obtained with no extra equipment. However, there is no data on whether MHR analysis is equivalent when obtained with ECG or PPG.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 {{years in the}} United Kingdom, {{midwives}} have implemented the routine use of intrapartum <b>fetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> regardless of the risk status of laboring women. This practice {{is at odds with}} the published research. The discrepancy between practice and best evidence merits further investigation. A qualitative study was conducted to evaluate midwives' attitudes and experiences about the use of <b>fetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> for women at low obstetric risk. Fifty-eight midwives working in two hospitals in the north of England were interviewed by using a semistructured approach. The taped interviews were transcribed and analyzed by using a general thematic approach. Issues included midwives' perceptions of low-risk status, the socialization of midwives, and the loss of woman-centered care. Midwives subscribed to the notion of woman-centered care, but because of a complexity of factors experienced in their daily working lives, they felt vulnerable when attempting to implement evidence-based <b>fetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> practices. Midwives regretted the loss of a woman-centered approach to care when technologic methods of intrapartum <b>fetal</b> heart rate <b>monitoring</b> were used indiscriminately.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess and}} explain {{deviations}} from recommended practice in National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines {{in relation to}} <b>fetal</b> heart <b>monitoring.</b> Design: Qualitative study. Setting: Large teaching hospital in the UK. Sample: Sixty-six hours of observation of 25 labours and interviews with 20 midwives of varying grades. Methods: Structured observations of labour and semistructured interviews with midwives. Interviews were undertaken using a prompt guide, audiotaped, and transcribed verbatim. Analysis {{was based on the}} constant comparative method, assisted by QSR N 5 software. Main outcome measures: Deviations from recommended practice in relation to <b>fetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> and insights into why these occur. Results: All babies involved in the study were safely delivered, but 243 deviations from recommended practice in relation to NICE guidelines on <b>fetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> were identified, with the majority (80 %) of these occurring in relation to documentation. Other deviations from recommended practice included indications for use of electronic <b>fetal</b> heart <b>monitoring</b> and conduct of <b>fetal</b> heart <b>monitoring.</b> There is evidence of difficulties with availability and maintenance of equipment, and some deficits in staff knowledge and skill. Differing orientations towards <b>fetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> were reported by midwives, which were likely to have impacts on practice. The initiation, management, and interpretation of <b>fetal</b> heart <b>monitoring</b> is complex and distributed across time, space, and professional boundaries, and practices in relation to <b>fetal</b> heart <b>monitoring</b> need to be understood within an organisational and social context. Conclusion: Some deviations from best practice guidelines may be rectified through straightforward interventions including improved systems for managing equipment and training. Other deviations from recommended practice need to be understood as the outcomes of complex processes that are likely to defy easy resolution. © RCOG 2006...|$|R

50|$|Other {{means of}} natural {{cervical}} ripening include nipple stimulation, which produces oxytocin, an organic hormone which {{is necessary for}} uterine contractions. Nipple stimulation can be performed manually, by use of a breast pump, or by suckling. Henci Goer, in her comprehensive book, The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth, details how this practice was researched in two separate studies of 100 and 200 women in the mid nineteen-eighties. Women were assigned randomly to two groups. In one group, nipples were stimulated for one-hour sessions, three times per day. In the other group, women were to avoid any form of nipple stimulation or sexual intercourse. The researchers concluded in both studies that nipple stimulation could indeed ripen the cervix {{and in some cases}} induce uterine contractions. Goer further notes that in the smaller study, an external <b>fetal</b> <b>monitor</b> was used, and no uterine hyperstimulation was noted.|$|E
40|$|Since its {{introduction}} more than 40 years ago, electronic <b>fetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> has become widely used for intrapartum surveillance to determine fetal wellbeing in labor. Although fetal hypoxia and acidosis {{are reflected in}} changes in fetal heart rate, {{there is no evidence}} that cardiotocography has been effective in reducing neonatal morbidity related to fetal distress occurring during labor. Indeed the specificity of this tool is poor and in many instances the incorporation of electronic <b>fetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> into intrapartum care has merely led to an increase in medical intervention rather than an improvement in neonatal outcome. Fetal electrocardiography (ECG) analysis provides an additional method for assessing the response of the fetus to hypoxia and in particular to the development of metabolic acidosis. ST changes in the fetal ECG can be quantified with computational analysis, reducing subjective interpretation that has been problematic with traditional electronic <b>fetal</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Formal algorithms indicating appropriate points for intervention in labor have been designed. The fetal ECG has been shown to be a useful adjunct to traditional electronic <b>fetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> in several randomized controlled trials with evidence of reduced rates of neonatal encephalopathy and reduced rates of obstetric intervention.

50|$|Internal cardiotocography uses an {{electronic}} transducer connected {{directly to the}} fetal scalp. A wire electrode {{is attached to the}} fetal scalp through the cervical opening and is connected to the monitor. This type of electrode is sometimes called a spiral or scalp electrode. Internal monitoring provides a more accurate and consistent transmission of the fetal heart rate than external monitoring because factors such as movement do not affect it. Internal monitoring may be used when external monitoring of the fetal heart rate is inadequate, or closer surveillance is needed. Internal tocometry can only be used if membranes (fore-waters) have ruptured either spontaneously or artificially, and the cervix is open. To gauge the strength of contractions, a small catheter (Intrauterine pressure catheter or IUPC) is passed into the uterus, past the fetus. Combined with an internal <b>fetal</b> <b>monitor,</b> an IUPC may give a more precise reading of the baby's heart rate and the strength of contractions.|$|E
