5|$|In December 2015 the Finnish MoD sent {{a letter}} to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the US informing them that the fighter project had been {{launched}} in the Defence Forces. The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet, which will be decommissioned as of 2025, with multi-role fighters. The project has been named the HX Fighter Program. The JAS-39 is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. The request for information concerning the HX Fighter Program was sent in April 2016. The five responses were received in November 2016. The official Request for Quotation will be sent to all five aircraft manufacturers that provided responses to the RFI, through their four governments, in the spring of 2018. The goal is to start the fighter candidates’ <b>environmental</b> <b>testing</b> in Finland in 2019. The buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021.|$|E

25|$|On 26 September 2016, the U.S. Army {{placed an}} order for another 130 JLTVs and 748 kits valued at $42 million; this was the third JLTV order since {{contract}} award. Fiscal Year 2016 funding budgets for 804 JLTVs. The Army received its first seven JLTVs for test {{at the end of}} September 2016 according to Colonel Shane Fullmer, JLTV project manager stated at an AUSA 2016 media briefing. He said test vehicles would be sent to Yuma, Arizona, for automotive and mobility testing; to Ft Huachuca, Arizona, for cyber, electronic warfare, and C4 testing; Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, for reliability and automotive testing; and to Alaska for automotive and <b>environmental</b> <b>testing.</b> Some JLTV testing was deferred during the EMD phase, as the government did not want to pay for testing with three suppliers, and it is now set for testing with a fleet of 100 JLTVs. By April 2017 30 JLTVs had been delivered, testing expected to continue through the first quarter of FY19. Also at an AUSA 2016 media briefing, Scott Davis, program executive officer for Combat Support & Combat Service Support, stated that Overall the JLTV programme expects to cut about five years off of the total program and save about US$5.9 billion, as Oshkosh's final competitive bid was low enough so the army decided to 'buy to budget' and get more platforms each year, which shrunk the total length of the contract and increased cost avoidances accrued each year. At AUSA 2016, Oshkosh displayed a JLTV General Purpose variant equipped with an EOS R-400S-MK2 remote weapon system integrated with Orbital ATK's M230 LF 30mm lightweight automatic chain gun.|$|E
500|$|The mission's primary payload was INSAT-1B, an Indian {{communications}} and weather observation satellite, which {{was released by}} the orbiter and boosted into a geostationary orbit. The secondary payload, replacing a delayed NASA communications satellite, was a four-metric-ton dummy payload, intended to test {{the use of the}} shuttle's [...] "Canadarm" [...] remote manipulator system. Scientific experiments carried onboard Challenger included the <b>environmental</b> <b>testing</b> of new hardware and materials designed for future spacecraft, the study of biological materials in electric fields under microgravity, and research into space adaptation syndrome (also known as [...] "space sickness"). The flight furthermore served as shakedown testing for the previously launched TDRS-1 satellite, which would be required to support the subsequent STS-9 mission.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the types of marine weapons used in response to diverse hostile threats. However, because marine weapons are only tested under a single set of environmental conditions, failures due to different environmental stresses have been difficult to detect. Hence, this study proposes an <b>environmental</b> <b>test</b> sequence for multi-environment <b>testing.</b> The <b>environmental</b> <b>test</b> sequences for electrical units described in the international standard IEC 60068 - 1, and for military supply described in the United States national standard MIL-STD- 810 G were investigated to propose guidelines for the appropriate test sequences. This study demonstrated the need for tests in multiple environments by investigating marine weapon accidents, and evaluated which <b>environmental</b> stresses and <b>test</b> items have the largest impacts on marine weapons using a two-phase quality function deployment (QFD) analysis of operational scenarios, environmental stresses, and <b>environmental</b> <b>test</b> items. Integer programming was used to determine the most influential test items and the shortest <b>environmental</b> <b>test</b> time, allowing us to propose optimal test procedures. Based on our analysis, we developed optimal <b>environmental</b> <b>test</b> sequences that could be selected by a test designer...|$|R

2500|$|The Atomic Weapons Research Establishment had a {{base on the}} site, {{used for}} <b>environmental</b> <b>testing,</b> i.e. when a {{laboratory}} test is conducted to determine the functional performance of a component or system under conditions that simulate the real {{environment in which the}} component or system is expected to operate. Many of the buildings from this time remain clearly visible from the quay at Orford, including the distinctive [...] "pagodas". Whilst it is maintained that no fissile material was tested on the site, the very high explosive initiator charge was present and the buildings were designed to absorb any accidental explosion, allowing gases and other material to vent and dissipate in a directed or contained manner. In the event of a larger accident, the roofs were designed to collapse onto the building, sealing it with a lid of concrete and shingle.|$|E
2500|$|While {{exploration}} and mining can {{be conducted by}} individual entrepreneurs or small businesses, most modern-day mines are large enterprises requiring large amounts of capital to establish. Consequently, the mining sector of the industry is dominated by large, often multinational, companies, most of them publicly listed. It {{can be argued that}} what {{is referred to as the}} 'mining industry' is actually two sectors, one specializing in exploration for new resources and the other in mining those resources. The exploration sector is typically made up of individuals and small mineral resource companies, called [...] "juniors", which are dependent on venture capital. The mining sector is made up of large multinational companies that are sustained by production from their mining operations. Various other industries such as equipment manufacture, <b>environmental</b> <b>testing,</b> and metallurgy analysis rely on, and support, the mining industry throughout the world. Canadian stock exchanges have a particular focus on mining companies, particularly junior exploration companies through Toronto's TSX Venture Exchange; Canadian companies raise capital on these exchanges and then invest the money in exploration globally. Some have argued that below juniors there exists a substantial sector of illegitimate companies primarily focused on manipulating stock prices.|$|E

40|$|Tin {{whiskers}} are {{electrically conductive}} crystalline structures of tin {{that over time}} may grow outward from tin-rich surfaces and present a reliability hazard to electronic systems. While {{the problem has been}} known for decades, no satisfactory explanation of whisker growth mechanisms exists, leaving the industry to create whisker-assessment tests based on empirical data gathered under various environmental storage conditions controlled for temperature, humidity and temperature cycling. The long-term predictability of these <b>environmental</b> storage <b>tests</b> has not been addressed and the accuracy of these tests in foreseeing whisker growth is unclear. In this thesis, different tin finishes are assessed for whisker growth in accordance with existing <b>environmental</b> <b>test</b> standards and compared to growth seen in ambient storage conditions. The results indicate that <b>environmental</b> <b>tests</b> may over-predict, under-predict, or show little distinguishable growth as compared to ambient-stored tin finishes. In conclusion, <b>environmental</b> <b>tests</b> are not a reliable method of assessing future whisker growth...|$|R
