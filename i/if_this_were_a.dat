2500|$|An {{additional}} {{assumption is}} {{that there would be}} sufficient pipeline infrastructure to deliver increased Canadian oil production to export markets. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> limiting factor, there could be impacts on Canadian crude oil prices, constraining future production growth. Another {{assumption is that}} US markets will continue to absorb increased Canadian exports. Rapid growth of tight oil production in the US, Canada's primary oil export market, has greatly reduced US reliance on imported crude. The potential for Canadian oil exports to alternative markets such as Asia is also uncertain. There are increasing political obstacles to building any new pipelines to deliver oil in Canada and the US. In November 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the proposal to build the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska.|$|E
