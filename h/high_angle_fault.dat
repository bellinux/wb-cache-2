In {{the initial stages of}} detachment faulting and <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault</b> scarps show extensive mass-wasting that reduces their slope. Flexural rotation further lowers scarp slope, hinders mass wasting, resulting in morphologically complex chaotic terrain between the breakaway and the denuded corrugated surface. Extension and drag along the fault plane uplifts a wedge of hangingwall material (apron). The detachment surface emerges along a continuous moat that sheds rocks and covers it with unconsolidated rubble, while local slumping emplaces rubble ridges overlying corrugations. The detachment fault zone is a set of anostomosed slip planes, elongated in the along-extension direction. Slip planes bind fault rock bodies defining the corrugations observed in microbathymetry and sonar. Fault planes with extension-parallel stria are exposed along corrugation flanks, where the rubble cover is shed. Detachment fault rocks are primarily basalt fault breccia at 13 ° 20 ‘N OCC, and gabbro and peridotite at 13 ° 30 ’N, demonstrating that brittle strain localization in shallow lithosphere form corrugations, regardless of lithologies in the detachment zone. Finally, faulting and volcanism dismember the 13 ° 30 ’N OCC, with widespread present and past hydrothermal activity (Semenov fields), while the Irinovskoe hydrothermal field at the 13 ° 20 ’N core complex suggests a magmatic source within the footwall. These results confirm the ubiquitous relationship between hydrothermal activity and oceanic detachment formation and evolution...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{destructive}} M 6. 7 earthquake struck Northern Nagano prefecture on November 22, 2014. The main shock {{occurred on}} the Kamishiro fault segment of the northern Itoigawa–Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL). We used data recorded at 41 stations of the local seismographic network in order to locate 2118 earthquakes that occurred between November 18 and November 30, 2014. To estimate hypocenters, we assigned low Vp models to stations within the Northern Fossa Magna (NFM) basin thus accounting for large lateral crustal heterogeneities across the Kamishiro fault. In order to further improve accuracy, the final hypocenter locations were recalculated inside a 3 D velocity model using the double-difference method. We used the aftershock activity distribution and focal mechanism solutions of major events in order to estimate the source fault area of the main shock. Our analysis suggests that the shallow part of the source fault corresponds to the surface trace of the Kamishiro fault and dips 30 °– 45 ° SE, while the deeper part of the source fault corresponds to the downdip portion of the Otari–Nakayama fault, a <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault</b> dipping 50 °– 65 ° SE that formed during {{the opening of the}} NFM basin in the Miocene. Along its surface trace the Otari–Nakayama fault has been inactive during the late Quaternary. We verified the validity of our model by calculating surface deformation using a simple homogeneous elastic half-space model and comparing it to observed surface deformation from satellite interferometry, assuming large coseismic slip in the areas of low seismicity and small coseismic slip in the areas of high seismicity. Shallowing of the source fault from 50 °– 65 ° to 30 °– 45 ° in the upper 4 km, in the areas where both surface fault traces are visible, is a result of footwall shortcut thrusting by the Kamishiro fault off the Otari–Nakayama fault...|$|E

40|$|The {{metamorphism}} of the carbonate {{rocks of}} the SE Zanskar Tibetan zone {{has been studied}} by `'illite crystallinity'' and calcite-dolomite thermometry. The epizonal Zangla unit overlies the anchizonal Chumik unit. This discontinuous inverse zonation demonstrates a late to post-metamorphic thrust of the first unit over the second. The studied area underwent a complex tectonic history: - The tectonic units were stacked from the NE to the SW, generating recumbent folds, NE dipping thrusts and the regional metamorphism. The compressive movements were active under lower temperature conditions, resulting in late thrusts that disturbed the metamorphic zonation. The discontinuous inverse metamorphic zonation dates from this phase. - A NE vergent backfolding phase occurred at lower temperature conditions. It caused the uplift of more metamorphic levels. - A late extensional phase is revealed {{by the presence of}} NE dipping low angle normal faults, and a major <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault,</b> the Sarchu fault. The low angle normal faults locally run along earlier thrusts (composite tectonic contacts). Their throw has been sufficient to reset a normal stratigraphic superposition (young layers overlying old ones), but insufficient to erase the inverse metamorphic relationship. However, the combined action of backfolding and normal faulting can locally lessen, or even cancel, the inverse metamorphic superposition. After deduction of the normal fault translation, the vertical component of the original thrust displacement through stratigraphy is 400 m, which is a value far too low to explain the temperature difference between the two units. The horizontal component of displacement is therefore far more important than the vertical one. The regional distribution of metamorphism within the Zangla unit points out to an anchizonal front and an epizonal inner part. This fact is in agreement with nappe tectonics...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the Jurassic and Cretaceous {{evolution}} of the buried northwards stretch of the Apulia Platform (Southern Italy) (Ombrina-Rospo Plateau - ORP), and adjacent Adriatic Basin. Exploration wells indicate that inner platform carbonate facies across the ORP in the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous are capped, along a subaerial exposure surface, by Oligocene/Miocene carbonates. A NW-trending intra-platform basin ("Casalbordino Corridor") was infilled with shallow- to deeper-water sediments in the late Early to Late Cretaceous interval, while platform margins were experiencing tectonic reactivation. The ORP-to-basin transitional belt formed a corner, defining a NW and a NE margin. The NW margin was essentially stationary. A syn- and early post-rift platform-toe bypass wedge formed when late Hettangian-Sinemurian extension produced the platform/basin relief. Export of platform material, coupled with a halt of faulting, made the platform/slope profile continuous in the late Early or early Middle Jurassic (possibly across an ooidal rim). Late Jurassic Ellipsactinia/coral reefs passed downdip into bioclastics. The Maiolica Fm. displays two cycles (M 1, M 2), where M 2 onlaps the slope built by M 1. In the Aptian, with lithospheric arching, a <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault</b> rejuvenated the margin. Off this margin, a narrow basin, locked between the ORP and a pelagic carbonate platform, was largely infilled with turbidites sourced by the ORP, but the high hampered the dispersal of the sand fraction. The NE margin displays prograding ooidal to bioclastic clinoforms (Middle and Upper Jurassic) downlapping onto the rift basin. In the Lower Cretaceous, the platform recovered after a slow-down of carbonate productivity (M 1 / 2 boundary). The Marne a Fucoidi Fm. thickens at the toe of, and seals, a fault backstepping the margin. Further backstepping occurred similar to 5 km platformwards along a (Cenomanian?) normal fault, producing room for a rudist factory.

40|$|Reverse-time {{migration}} {{has proven}} to be successful for structures with steep dips and strong velocity contrasts. Applying this algorithm to a large scale seismic model requires significant computational expense, particularly if strong velocity contrasts are present in the model. Here I present a layer-stripping migration technique, in which I use the reverse-time method to migrate seismic sections through constant or smoothly varying velocity layers, one layer at a time. As part of the migration in a given layer, the bottom boundary of the layer is defined and a seismic section is collected along it. This new section serves as the boundary condition for migration in the next layer. This procedure is repeated layer by layer. The final migration result is composited from the individual layers images. The layer-stripping migration algorithm can be summarized as three steps: (1) model definition, (2) wavefield extrapolation and imaging, and (3) boundary determination. The migration scheme posed in this way is similar to datuming with an imaging condition. The advantages of the layer-stripping method are: (1) it preserves the benefits of the reverse-time method, i. e., it handles strong velocity contrasts between layers and steeply dipping structures; (2) it eliminates artificial interlayer multiples; (3) it reduces computational expense in high velocity layers; and (4) it allows interpretational constraint during image formation. The method has been implemented with both an explicit 4 th-order time, 10 th-order space, finite-difference approximation to the scalar wave equation, and an implicit 2 nd-order time, 4 th-order space finite-difference scheme applied to the linearly transformed wave equation (Li, 1986). The capability of post-stack layer-stripping reverse-time migration is illustrated on a synthetic CMP data and a CMP data from a survey over a faulted anticline in a fold and thrust belt. For pre-stack layer-stripping reverse-time migration, I present migrations of two synthetic data sets and a field data example from part of the marine seismic reflection profile RU- 3, crossing the Hosgri fault offshore southern central California. The Hosgri fault appears as a northeast dipping <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault</b> with a thrust component...|$|E
40|$|New-Caledonia island {{consists}} of an ultramafic nappe thrusted over a continental and arc-derived basement {{as the result of}} the closure of a back-arc basin during the upper Eocene. The morphology of New-Caledonia is mostly characterized by its elongated shape and rectilinear coastline. Indeed, the western and eastern edges of the island are delineated by N 140 trending normal faults that are well imaged on seismic lines. Major tectonic lineaments onland, including the scarps corresponding to the main boundary of the ultramafic nappe, also trend N 140 suggesting a morphotectonic control by faults having similar kinematics (longitudinal flexure-fault of previous authors). We provide detailed observations from some of these scarps demonstrating indeed that these are not erosional features in origin. We explore the possibility that such surfaces do represent major tectonic limits that accommodated extension and significant tectonic thinning of both the peridotite nappe and its basement. Remnants of a complex extensional fault zone, 200 m wide, are still preserved along the western scarp of the Mont Dore mountain, close to Noumea city. The deformed zone is composed of an early shallow dipping detachment fault, some decimeters thick, offset by a group of late high angle normal faults and is bounded by cataclastic breccias that progressively pass into the fractured host peridotite. The late <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault</b> zones have been the site of important syn-tectonic fluid circulation and are underlined by cm-thick silica infills bearing vertical striae. Typical morphology of the main scarps with break of slope is related to the combination of high angle normal faults and low angle detachment. Similar shallow dipping detachment surfaces have been observed along the east coast of southern New-Caledonia as well as within the ultramafic nappe itself and its basement. This study confirms that N 140 oriented, large fault zones, with pure-normal to transtensional component of displacement, controlled the morphotectonic evolution of New-Caledonia at the regional scale, after the obduction of ophiolite nappe at the end of the Eocene. Such a fact has to be taken into account when attempting to reconstruct the post-obduction evolution of the island and more particularly when considering the development and distribution of the Ni-rich lateritic surfaces...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The Himalaya are the {{geologic}} {{manifestation of}} continental collision, and in northern Pakistan the Main Mantle thrust (MMT) {{is a major}} suture along which the collision occurred. A newly recognized basement uplift near Besham village in southern Kohistan, adjacent to the MMT, is bounded on {{the east and west}} by north-trending <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault</b> zones. The uplift exposes basement rocks that are significantly different from any of the other plutonic and metamorphic rocks of southern Kohistan and that are not seen elsewhere in the Pakistan Himalaya west of the Nanga Parbat-Haramosh massif (NPHM). Rocks of the Besham area are subdivided from oldest to youngest into five groups. The oldest rocks are (1) the Besham group, metasediments and heterogeneous gneisses. In conjunction with field evidence, major, trace, and rare earth element analyses of Besham gneisses suggests that the gneisses formed in situ from a sedimentary protolith. The presence of both quartzofeldspathic gneiss and sodic quartzofeldspathic gneiss in the Besham group may be attributable to variable protolith composition. The Besham group was intruded by (2) mafic dikes that were subsequently metamorphosed to amphibolites. Geochemical data suggests that these tholeiitic dikes have island arc geochemical affinities. (3) The third group of rocks compose the Lahor granitic complex, which includes cogenetic, small granitic intrusions and associated pegmatites; the Shang granite, the Dubair granite and the Shorgara pegmatite. Unconformably lying upon these three units is (4) the Karora group, which comprises conglomeratic, calcareous, and carbonaceous sedimentary rocks. The Karora group provides evidence for more than one metamorphic event in the Besham area basement uplift, i. e., the Karora group is metamorphosed to middle greenschist facies, in contrast with the underlying units, which are metamorphosed to epidote- amphibotite facies. The youngest unit observed in the Besham area basement uplift is (5) a relatively undeformed leucogranite that intrudes both the Karora group and the Besham group. The leucogranite is a previously unrecognized unit. The metamorphic and granitic rocks of the Besham area uplift may be correlative with basement exposed in the Nanga Parbat-Haramosh massif. Specifically, the quartzofeldspathic gneisses of the Besham group may correlate with the Nanga Parbat gneisses, and the amphibolites found in the Besham area may correlate with mafic dikes of the massif. Further study of both the Besham area uplift and the NPHM can provide a better understanding of Precambrian basement rocks of northern Pakistan...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} mineralogical, geochemical and geochronological {{studies in}} the Variscides and Uralides to elucidate the petrochemical history of dynamic orogenic processes. In combination with published data the results highlight significant differences between both orogens. Pre-orogenic (i. e. pre-Uralian) basement is incorporated to different degrees and in contrasting patterns in Variscides and Uralides. In the Variscides numerous different terranes were agglomerated in a complicated large scale bow-shaped pattern, whereas in the Uralides mainly the fragments of the longitudinally trending eastern margin of Baltica were incorporated. The Taratash Complex of the Middle Urals is an outstanding example of such fragments. This thesis delineates a succession of Palaeoproterozoic magmatic and amphibolite facies tectonometamorphic events (2. 46 – 1. 8 Ga) following Archean granulite facies metamorphism and granitoid formation (3. 65 – 2. 91 Ga) recorded in the rocks of the Taratash Complex. In the Uralides, pre-orogenic basement is restricted {{to the west of}} the Main Uralian Fault leading to a simple geometry compared to the Variscides. In both orogens, pre-Neoproterozoic rocks are only preserved in basement slivers, whereas remnants of Neoproterozoic magmatism and tectonism are abundant. For the southern Urals this is shown in a study of detrital zircon. Isotope signatures (U/Pb) of detrital zircon serve as geochemical indicator for the dynamic process of terrane accretion and for the transition from a passive to an active continental margin around 620 Ma, which affected large parts of the eastern margin of Baltica. The main suture lines and associated former subduction zones can well be traced in the Variscides (i. e. Rheic suture) and Uralides (i. e. Main Uralian Fault), although secondary suture lines in both orogens require further characterization for better understanding. Different to the Variscides, where high-pressure metamorphic rocks are known in all major terranes, such rocks are exclusively observed along the Main Uralian Fault in the Uralides. Lawsonite bearing mineral assemblages in rodingitized ultramafite of the Maksyutov Complex (Southern Urals) that are investigated in a part of this thesis are an example of such metamorphism related to the dynamic process of subduction. In contrast to the Variscides, which are characterized by large scale lithospheric reequilibration, the Uralides were not affected by significant orogenic collapse and postorogenic extension. This is also reflected in the preservation of prograde high-pressure/low-temperature metamorphic assemblages in the Maksyutov Complex (e. g. Lawsonite-bearing assemblages) and associated low-temperature pseudomorphs presented in this thesis. The lack of postorogenic extension highlights that the Uralides are characterized by a pronounced and isostatically equilibrated crustal root. During the Variscan orogenesis existing continental crust was extensively recycled. In contrast to this, large amounts of juvenile crust, which formed in magmatic arcs, are a characteristic feature of the Uralian orogen. Here, data are presented for the Valerianovka arc in the Transuralian zone, which is rarely addressed in the literature. It is shown that granitoids formed by mixing of slab-derived melts and melts generated in the crust. This result supports the model of an Andean type setting. Juvenile crust is particularly dominating in the Easturalian zone, where granitoids also formed after accretion of magmatic arcs. In this thesis it is demonstrated that the Borisov granite intruded in a first pulse of melt generation at 358 ± 23 Ma. Granitoid melt formation as well as high-temperature amphibolite facies metamorphic overprint of host rocks also reflect the dynamic process of crustal thickening during the Uralian orogeny. Variscides and Uralides also vary with respect to their crustal architecture. Major crustal units of the Variscan orogen have a subhorizontal orientation, whereas crustal scale structural boundaries in the Uralides are <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault</b> zones. Such structural differences are in line with the observation that the Variscides experienced significant crustal shortening, whereas the Uralides were affected by lower degrees of shortening. This can be demonstrated in a comparison of the Rhenohercynian (Variscan) and the Westuralian foreland fold and thrust belts. Expulsion of hydrothermal fluids to the Variscan foreland during the dynamic process of orogenic compaction is investigated in this thesis applying various techniques. Enrichment of mobile components, such as Ba and NH 4, in sedimentary rocks studied in the RWTH- 1 well in Aachen (Germany) serves as geochemical indicator for palaeo fluid-flow. Illite mineralogy, fluid inclusion petrography and microthermometry as well as isotope geochemistry of fluid inclusions and vein minerals suggest that expulsion of metamorphic fluids at the Variscan front was a short termed (approx. 5000 y) process, which was affected by fracture opening during episodic seismic activity and which occurred at depths between 4500 and 8000 m and temperatures close to 400 °C. Both, Variscan and Uralian orogens were affected by post-Palaeozoic deformation, however Alpine reworking significantly obliterated Variscan structures, in particular in the southern part of the Variscides...|$|E

Here, we examine the effects and relative importance that different types of initial weaknesses have on extensional lithospheric deformation style.

Models using single localised weak seeds produce symmetric narrow rifts, irrespective of whether or not strain-softening is included, while models that include regions of diffuse weaknesses produce a wide rift mode. Models that include an initial weak fault tend to produce more asymmetric rifting leading to a core complex mode. By distributing the strain laterally over large areas, the ductile lower crust tends to oppose the narrow rift mode forced by the initial weakness.

Submarine and buried slides complexes cover an area of about 180 km 2, and develop from 1600 to 2400 m water depths. <b>High</b> <b>angle</b> <b>faults,</b> which deform the seafloor cause the Águilas Escarpment and diverse small-scale submarine slides. Recent or sub-recent active tectonics, and the coeval uplifting of the Palomares Margin, is proposed {{to be the main}} trigger mechanism for the slides. The failure scars favour the evolution of a juvenile submarine canyon (the Águilas Canyon) due to retrogressive slidin...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to define the {{structural}} geometry and kinematics of Neogene deformation of the Matese Massif in order to validate the applicability of either thin-skinned or thick-skinned compressive styles in the Apennines. The Matese structure appears as a single N-vergent thrust sheet above a low <b>angle</b> thrust <b>fault,</b> which was later deformed by footwall thrust sheets. The massif is com-posed mainly of Mesozoic carbonates of inner platform to by-pass and slope facies, separated within the thrust sheet by <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>faults</b> with small component of re-verse displacements. These faults acted as normal faults in the Mesozoic and Ceno-zoic and affected the carbonate facies distribution. During Neogene compression they were mildly reactivated and then passively truncated by the basal short-cut thrust fault that cut from pre-Triassic units to Jurassic dolostone towards the foreland. Finally, Quaternary extensional tectonics dissected the thrust sheet displacing it by up to 1000 m. This has resulted in the present-day structural setting of the Matese Massif as a horst bounded to the SW and NE by extensional basins filled with continental deposits...|$|R
40|$|A large post-glacial {{deep-seated}} {{mass movement}} is described {{from the area}} east of Vipiteno-Sterzing (Alto Adige-South Tyrol, Eastern Alps), mainly devloping in calcschists of the ophiolitic Glockner nappe (southen antiform of SW Tauren window). A close relationship exists between differential slope evolution, structural setting, and slope attitude. Lateral spread develops {{in an area where}} the dominant schistosity is subvertical and parallel to the slope, and is facilitated by dissolution of evaporite-bearing bodies. Sackung develops in an area with low-angle schistosity and NNE-SSW <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>faults,</b> parallel to the ridge segment. A huge rock-fall was set off the intersection of the steep N-Dipping schistosity with E-W and N-S to NNE-SSW fault and joints. As a whole, the deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) is an outstanding example of how the mechanics of large mass movements and their potential evolution are controlled by the structural framework, which is the ultimate result of a complex tectonic history...|$|R
50|$|The {{rocks in}} the area are {{extremely}} diverse, with exposed (non-volcanic) layers ranging in age from Paleozoic to Holocene. Marine deposits (carbonates) were deposited during repeated advances of late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic seas. Folding and faulting of Lower Cretaceous layers occurred during the Laramide disturbance in the nearby East Potrillo Mountains. The area has been above sea level since the Cretaceous period. In the early to middle Tertiary, the Riley Cox andesitic pluton was emplaced. This activity also seems {{to be associated with the}} intrusion of andesitic and quartz latite dikes in the East Potrillo range. During the middle Tertiary, <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>faulting</b> and uplifting occurred in the East Potrillo range and began to form intermontane basins. In the middle to late Quaternary, alkali olivine basalt was extruded from fissures in the Fitzgerald, Robledo, and Aden faults. During the late Pleistocene to Holocene, movement occurred along the Fitzgerald and Robledo faults. Holocene deposits are mostly fine blown sand.|$|R
40|$|The bedrock in the Wildrose area is {{predominantly}} {{a sequence of}} metamorphosed sedimentary and possible volcanic rocks {{that is more than}} 15, 000 feet thick. All the metamorphic rocks are Precambrian in age on stratigraphic evidence. The rocks are divided into three age groups, early Precambrian, later Precambrian, and Precambrian (?), that are separated by unconformities. The early Precambrian Panamint metamorphic complex has been divided into two series that are separated by a profound unconformity. Small stocks and dikes of granitic rocks, which are presumably Cretaceous in age, intrude the metamorphic rocks. Tertiary sedimentary rocks and Quaternary alluvium are also present in the area. The structural features of the area are ascribed to four periods of deformation. The large folds in the early Precambrian rocks and associated minor folds were produced during the first two periods of deformation of early Precambrian age. Low <b>angle</b> <b>faults</b> are evidence of the third deformation which is considered to be Cretaceous in age. The fourth period of deformation produced <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>faults.</b> Movement along the <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>faults</b> began in late Tertiary time and has continued to the present. All the Precambrian rocks of the area have been affected by middle or lower middle grade metamorphism. Even though structural evidence suggests that metamorphism must have accompanied the earlier periods of deformation, the present mineral assemblages reflect the third period of deformation which, on the basis of mineral age measurements, was Cretaceous in age. Narrow contact metamorphic aureoles surround the larger masses of granite. Radioactive ages were measured in five areas in the Death Valley-Mojave Desert region. The rocks are Precambrian in age on stratigraphic evidence in three areas, the Wildrose area of the Panamint Range, the Mountain Pass district, and the Marble Mountains. The rocks in Joshua Tree National Monument and the Kilbeck Hills are presumably Precambrian, but no stratigraphic evidence of their age has been found. The geochronologic studies in the five areas indicate three distinct groups of K - Ar and Rb-Sr ages. Ages of approximately 1650 million years are obtained on metamorphic rocks and associated pegmatite s in the Mountain Pas s district. Younger igneous rocks at Mountain Pass and in the Marble Mountains have age patterns that are interpreted to indicate intrusion in the 1350 to 1450 million year interval. Metamorphic rocks in the Wildrose area, Joshua Tree National Monument, and the Kilbeck Hills have ages in the 75 to 85 million year interval which are interpreted as the age of regional metamorphism related to the Cretaceous Nevadan orogeny. An age of 73 million years was obtained on a post-metamorphic granite. ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> east-west <b>fault</b> {{passing through}} Hatcher Pass {{separates}} the plutonic rocks {{on the north}} side of the fault from the Hatcher Pass schist south of the fault. The Hatcher Pass schist consists mainly of metamorphosed and deformed sedimentary rocks, of Late Cretaceous to Paleocene age. The schist may represent subducted Valdez Group that was exhumed in the forearc region from beneath the Peninsular terrane. Both deformed and undeformed small felsic dikes occur in the schist. Several bodies of serpentinite are contained within the schist.|$|R
40|$|Structural methods {{based on}} {{homogeneous}} stress states predict that joints growing in an extending crust form with strike orientations identical to normal faults. However, we document a field example where the strikes of genetically related normal faults and joints are almost mutually perpendicular. Field relationships {{allowed us to}} constrain the fracture sequence and tectonic environment for fault and joint growth. We hypothesize that fault slip can perturb the surrounding stress field {{in a manner that}} controls the orientations of induced secondary structures. Numerical models were used to examine the stress field around normal faults, taking into consideration the eects of 3 -D fault shape, geometrical arrangement of overlapping faults, and a range of stress states. The calculated perturbed stress fields around model normal faults indicate that it is possible for joints to form at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> to <b>fault</b> strike. Such joint growth may occur at the lateral tips of an isolated fault, but is most likely in a relay zone between overlapping <b>faults.</b> However, the <b>angle</b> between joints and faults is also influenced by the remote stress state, and is particularly sensitive to the ratio of fault-parallel to fault-perpendicular stress. As this ratio increases, joints can propagate away from <b>faults</b> at increasingly <b>higher</b> <b>angles</b> to <b>fault</b> strike. We conclude that the combined remote stress state and perturbed local stress field associated with overlapping fault geometries resulted in joint growth at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> to norma...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Large {{segments of the}} major <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>faults</b> in the Salton Trough area are readily identifiable in Skylab images. Along active faults, distinctive topographic features such as scarps and offset drainage, and vegetation differences due to ground water blockage in alluvium are visible. Other fault-controlled features along inactive as well as active faults visible in Skylab photography include straight mountain fronts, linear valleys, and lithologic differences producing contrasting tone, color or texture. A northwestern extension of a fault in the San Andreas set, is postulated by the regional alignment of possible fault-controlled features. The suspected fault is covered by Holocene deposits, principally windblown sand. A northwest trending tonal change in cultivated fields across Mexicali Valley is visible on Skylab photos. Surface evidence for faulting was not observed; however, the linear {{may be caused by}} differences in soil conditions along an extension of a segment of the San Jacinto fault zone. No evidence of faulting could be found along linears which appear as possible extensions of the Substation and Victory Pass faults, demonstrating that the interpretation of linears as faults in small scale photography must be corroborated by field investigations...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The Facey Rock area {{includes}} approximately 4 {{square miles}} in the Eastern Paleozoic Subprovince of the Klamath Mountains north of Callahan, California. The structurally complex terrain is composed of sparcely fossiliferous Silurian graywacke, sparsely fossiliferous Ordovician limestone, Devonian to Cretaceous chloritic quartzite and minor gabbroic and dioritic intrusive rocks. The two limestone lithologies recognized {{in the area are}} the Late Ordovician Platy Limestone Member and the Middle Ordovician Massive Limestone Member of the Facey Rock Limestone. These are interpreted as shallow water carbonate bank and deeper water carbonate deposits respectively. Both contain minor amounts of primary bedded chert. The graywacke is interpreted as a proximal turbidite. The chloritic quartzite is believed to be an upper plate remnant of the Devonian to Cretaceous, regional Mallethead Thrust. Several large, recent landslides are located in the vicinity of Facey Rock. Portions of the landslide debris along with talus deposits have been cemented into a loose breccia by groundwater supersaturated with calcium carbonate. Thrust faults separate the two limestone members from each other and from the underlying graywacke. They are responsible for the successively older, upward sequence of units observed at Facey Rock. These thrusts are considered subsidiary to the regional Mallethead Thrust. There are numerous <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>faults</b> in the area postdating the thrusts...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was the {{determination}} of the geotectonic structure of Eastern Attica, from data of surface analysis with geomorphic indices, remote sensing and classic mapping techniques. The geomorphic indices of active tectonics used, were slope and aspect of terrain, hypsometric curve and hypsometric integral, drainage basin asymmetry, mountain - front sinuosity and longitudinal river profiles. We also contacted a drainage basin analysis in major rivers of the studied area. The results of the above analysis showed that the area can be divided in three major subareas: (a) the basin of Spata, with an extension regime. The basins show a relative subduction of the area with a detachment fault located in the eastern Ymittos Mt. The general movement of the areas has a direction from west to east. (b) The area south of Spata basin up to Lavrion zone, which shows an extension regime too but with <b>higher</b> <b>angle</b> <b>faults</b> and different direction pattern. The basins of these area show a relative subduction. The three mountainous areas, Olympos, Paneion and Merenta probably represent a anticline with north dipping. The margins of the small basins in the area are active. (c) The area of Lavrion which differentiates in comparison with the previous areas, in a sense of morphotectonic behavior and lithology. In this part the indices showed an uplift of the total area. ...|$|R
30|$|A large {{earthquake}} (Mw= 7.7) along a {{plate boundary}} {{occurred in the}} south of Java Island on July 17, 2006, and caused a significant tsunami. We made GPS observations and tsunami heights measurements during the period from July 24 to August 1, 2006. The earthquake seems to be due to an interplate low <b>angle</b> reverse <b>faulting,</b> though there might be a possibility of <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>faulting</b> within the subducting lithosphere. Crustal deformation distribution due to the earthquake, aided by tsunami heights measurements, might clarify which would be the case. We occupied 29 sites by GPS in the area of southern Java encompassing the area from 107.8 E to 109.50 E. These sites were occupied once before the earthquake. However, {{we were not able to}} detect significant coseismic displacements. The obtained displacements, most of which span several years, show ESE direction in ITRF 2000 frame. This represents the direction of Sunda block motion. The tsunami heights measured at 11 sites were 6 – 7 m along the southern coast of Java and indicate that the observed heights are systematically higher than those estimated from numerical simulations that are based on seismic data analysis. This might suggest that fault offsets might have been larger—nearly double—than those estimated using seismic analysis. These results lead us to an idea that the rupture was very slow. If this is the case, the earthquake might have been a “tsunami earthquake” that is similar to the one that occurred on June 2, 1994 in the east of the present earthquake.|$|R
