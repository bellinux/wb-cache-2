50|$|Burns and Rafay {{launched}} {{a number of}} Charter challenges to the Canadian government's decision, including that section 6 mobility rights provided them rights against extradition and to be charged in Canada (since the murders occurred in the US, Canada could only charge them with planning the crime, so this option was ruled out).

50|$|Moving on to {{consider}} section 11(h) of the Charter, the Court considered {{the argument that}} the crimes of kidnapping and child-stealing were too similar. The Court noted that while the Canadian government's decisions in extradition are bound by the Charter under section 32, the actions of a foreign government are not. This was relevant to section 11(h), since its rights are held against trials and the Canadian government would not be conducting the trial. The Court went on to argue many other rights under section 11 would also be irrelevant to extradition. For example, section 11 guarantees the presumption of innocence, but in practice Canada already <b>extradites</b> <b>persons</b> to countries that do not presume innocence.|$|R
25|$|The Supreme Court of Canada, in {{the case}} United States v.

Human rights and fundamental freedoms have traditionally been treated with internal legal acts and over time their treatment and respect made the responsibility also based on international law.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to analyze the various {{counter-terrorism}} strategies undertaken by Indonesia and to explain the reasons of the Indonesian government chose those strategies. Moreover, this study explores generally and theoretically the differences of Indonesian strategies from other state???s strategies on countering terrorism as well as the actions taken to implement the strategies. This thesis also verifies the success of strategies in combating terrorism. Finally, this thesis investigates the Indonesian people in general support government strategies. This thesis is a theoretical-based qualitative study. It is eclectic and uses several approaches including interviews, historical method of study, and document analysis. This thesis implements indirect strategy to analyze the combat terrorism in Indonesia. Indirect strategy emphasizes diplomatic and economic as an indirect pressure, then political deterrence and military coercion as a direct pressure. The result has shown that there were some reasons so that the Indonesian government chose these strategies namely, maintaining stability and peace in the region generally, particularly in Indonesia and rebuilding the Indonesian economy because the terrorist attack devastated much of the infrastructure of the bombing area. Then, the actions were taken by the Indonesian government to implement these strategies such as, building the capacity through education, the civilian security and law enforcement personnel has joined in ATA (Anti-Terrorism Assistance) program in fighting terrorism, and freezing and preventing access to account of the organization terrorist as well as prosecute or <b>extradite</b> <b>person</b> involved in organization terrorist. Furthermore, through the winning the hearts and minds of people strategy, various religious and civil society groups support the government efforts to fight terrorism. This is one of indicator if the Indonesian government has been successful to combat terrorism. In addition, the Indonesian Government has successfully made arrests and convictions since the first Bali bombings in 2002, with more than 220 suspects jailed for terrorist activities since then. The Indonesian government has been working hard to take strong and wide-ranging counterterrorism measures which have achieved a measurable operational success. In sum, we find that indirect pressure combined direct pressure can help combat terrorist movement in Indonesi...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} I explore a narrow {{question}} that was raised, but not fully addressed, in the Questions relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite (Belgium v Senegal) case: does {{a state that has}} custody over a person who is suspected of the crime of torture, but that is unwilling or unable to prosecute that person itself, have an obligation to <b>extradite</b> that <b>person</b> to a state that seeks extradition, and that is able and willing to prosecute the suspect? The International Court of Justice (ICJ or Court) answered the question in the negative. The Court’s judgment exposes the fundamentally weak legal position of states that may have the strongest links with a suspect, and that may be best capable of prosecuting that person. The emergence of an absolutist obligation to prosecute of the custodial state has annihilated competing claims, whether or not these are based on a stronger link or better enforcement capabilities. Paradoxically, the result may be that a suspect may not be prosecuted at all...|$|R

5000|$|After the French Revolution, {{international}} {{attitudes towards}} the extradition of political offenders began a slow shift. In 1833, Belgium {{became the first}} country to legislate a prohibition against the extradition of political offenders, and included such a prohibition in its extradition treaty with France the following year. France itself began including such exceptions in its extradition treaties with various other countries over the several decades that followed. France began to include the political offence exception in its treaties later that year; the United States followed suit starting in 1843, and England in 1852. Belgium, as the first country to codify a political offence exception to extradition, was also a pioneer in efforts to define the outer limits of what exactly constitutes a [...] "political offence".

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{accountability for}} mass atrocities. It presents {{a case study}} of Uganda that has undergone a two-decade conflict between the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) insurgent group and the national army, the Uganda People’s Defence Armed Forces (UPDF). The government of Uganda has initiated various accountability measures that include international and domestic prosecutions, truth telling, reparations and traditional justice to address international crimes and other human rights violations committed during the conflict. The thesis in particular investigates how all these mechanisms could be used in a way that ensures that Uganda fulfils its international obligations and that the different measures complement each other. The thesis traces the background to the conflict that began in 1986 and explores the consequences of the conflict on the civilian population in Uganda. It alludes to its spread from Uganda to South Sudan and since 2008, to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Central African Republic. It argues that the significant and continuous involvement of the government of Sudan from 1994 to 2005 internationalised the LRA conflict. It further finds that both the LRA and the UPDF perpetrated war crimes and crimes against humanity during the conflict. The thesis further discusses the international obligation of Uganda to prosecute, punish and <b>extradite</b> <b>persons</b> responsible for the commission of international crimes and to ensure remedies to victims of such crimes and other human rights violations. It finds that the lapse of Part II of the Amnesty Act that allowed for a ‘blanket amnesty’ leaves room for Uganda to fulfil its international obligations. The thesis further investigates the Agreement on Accountability and Reconciliation and its Annexure reached between the government of Uganda and the LRA in Juba that ushers in the various accountability pursuits in Uganda. It argues that the implementation and successes of the Agreement depends on the consultations, legislations, policies and the establishment and workings of the institutions envisaged that could lead to justice, truth and reparations in Uganda. The thesis finds that the different accountability measures that Uganda is pursuing correspond to the political, social and historical conditions in Uganda, in particular, decades of armed conflict and human rights violations with impunity of perpetrators. It concludes that the success of the accountability undertakings will largely depend on the high calibre of officials and staff of the different institutions and their ability to deal wisely with challenges that will inevitably arise. It further finds that a political will and commitment is essential to ensure adequate investment in technical, material and financial resources and that non-interference of the government {{in the work of the}} institutions will ensure success. It concludes that such a political will and commitment, a robust consultation with stakeholders including victim groups and the creation of alliances locally, nationally, regionally and internationally, Uganda’s accountability pursuits will lead to the desired justice, truth and reparations.
