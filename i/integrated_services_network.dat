40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} Start-time Fair Queueing (SFQ) {{algorithm}} that is computationally efficient and achieves fairness regardless {{of variation in}} a server capacity. We analyze its single server and end-to-end deadline guarantee for variable rate Fluctuation Constrained (FC) and Exponentially Bounded Fluctuation (EBF) servers. To support heterogeneous services and multiple protocol families in <b>integrated</b> <b>services</b> <b>networks,</b> we present a hierarchical SFQ scheduler and derive its performance bounds. Our analysis demonstrates that SFQ is suitable for <b>integrated</b> <b>services</b> <b>networks</b> since it: 1) achieves low average as well as maximum delay for low-throughput applications (e. g., interactive audio, telnet, etc.); 2) provides fairness which is desirable for VBR video; 3) provides fairness, regardless of variation in server capacity, for throughput-intensive, flow-controlled data applications; 4) enables hierarchical link sharing which is desirable for managing heterogeneity; and 5) is computationally efficient.

40|$|Purpose: In the {{transformation}} of health care systems, the introduction of <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> <b>networks</b> {{is considered to be}} one of the main solutions for enhancing efficiency. In the last few years, a wealth of literature has emerged on the topic of services integration. However, the question of how <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> <b>networks</b> should be modelled to suit different implementation contexts has barely been touched. To fill that gap, this article presents four models for the organization of mental health integrated networks. Data sources: The proposed models are drawn from three recently published studies on mental health <b>integrated</b> <b>services</b> in the province of Quebec (Canada) with the author as principal investigator. Description: Following an explanation of the concept of <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> <b>network</b> and a description of the Quebec context for mental health networks, the models, applicable in all settings: rural, urban or semi-urban, and metropolitan, and summarized in four figures, are presented. Discussion and conclusion: To apply the models successfully, the necessity of rallying all the actors of a system, from the strategic, tactical and operational levels, according to the type of integration involved: functional/administrative, clinical and physician-system is highlighted. The importance of formalizing activities among organizations and actors in a network and reinforcing the governing mechanisms at the local level is also underlined. Finally, a number of integration strategies and key conditions of success to operationalize <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> <b>networks</b> are suggested. <br...|$|R

Consequently network technologies need to support them. For many years, the ATM based Broadband-ISDN has generally been regarded as the ultimate networking technology, which can integrate voice, data, and video services. With the recent tremendous growth of the Internet and the reluctant deployment of public ATM networks, the future development of ATM seems to be less clear than it used to be. In the past IP provided (and was though to provide) only best effort services, thus, despite its world wide diffution, was not considered as a network solution for multimedia application. Currently many of the IETF working groups work on areas related to integrated services, and IP is also proposing itself as networking technology for supporting voice, data, and video services.
