Understanding {{the product}} and process {{variable}} on the final product performance {{is an essential part}} of the quality-by-design (QbD) principles in pharmaceutical development. The <b>hard</b> <b>capsule</b> is an established pharmaceutical dosage form used worldwide in development and manufacturing. The empty <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> are supplied as an excipient that is filled by pharmaceutical manufacturers with a variety of different formulations and products. To understand the potential variations of the empty <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> as an input parameter and its potential impact on the finished product quality, a study was performed investigating the critical quality parameters within and in between different batches of empty <b>hard</b> gelatin <b>capsules.</b> The variability of the <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> showed high consistency within the specification of the critical quality parameters. This also accounts for the disintegration times, when automatic endpoint detection was used. Based on these data, <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> can be considered as a suitable excipient for product development using QbD principles.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the dissolution rate and bioavailability, solid dispersions of evodiamine in PVP K 30 with different enriched samples of evodiamine to PVP K 30 ratios were prepared by solvent method. Our studies showed that the dissolution rate of evodiamine was significantly higher in the solid dispersion system in comparison with that in enriched samples of evodiamine or physical mixtures. The increase of the dissolution rate was evidently related to the ratio of evodiamine to PVP K 30. The solid dispersion system (enriched samples of evodiamine/PVP K 30 = 1 / 6, w/w) gave the highest dissolution rate: about 27. 7 -fold {{higher than that of}} enriched samples of evodiamine in <b>hard</b> <b>capsules.</b> Powder X-ray diffraction studies showed that enriched samples of evodiamine presented a total chemical stability after its preparation as solid dispersions. In vivo administration studies indicated that solid dispersions of evodiamine in <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> had a higher Cmax and a shorter Tmax than those of physical mixture in <b>hard</b> <b>capsules,</b> and the differences of Cmax and Tmax between them were significant.

40|$|Introduction Recent studies {{prove that}} the number of {{patients}} with inflammatory bowel disease is increasing all over the world due to contamination, industrialization and changes in the style of live. Some studies have shown that 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA), an anti-inflammatory agent, must be the election treatment for these pathologies. In recent years, the production of microparticles systems seems to be equally promising to develop dosage forms {{in order to reduce the}} dosage frequency (1). On the other hand, the efficacy of this drug in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases may be optimized with a controlled release drug delivery system which maximizes topical exposure of the drug to the diseased tissue and minimizes systemic absorption of the drug (2). Therefore, the objective of the present paper is to design an oral multi-unit dosage form containing 5 -ASA that protects drug up to colon without causing toxicity. The proposed system consists of beads of several compositions (polymers with different nature and characteristics) introduced in an <b>enteric</b> <b>hard</b> gelatin <b>capsule</b> to obviate the transition across the stomach. Materials and Methods 5 – Aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) was a gift from Schering Plough (Madrid, España). Eudragit ® FS 30 D was received from Degussa Iberia S. A. (Barcelona, España). The following materials were obtained from the indicated suppliers and used as received: alginic acid sodium salt (low viscosity) and calcium chloride anhydrous from Sigma (Barcelona, Spain); chitosan, low molecular weight, from Aldrich Chemical Company (Barcelona, Spain); di-sodium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous, potassium di-hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride and hydrochloric acid from Panreac Química S. A. (Barcelona, España). Alginate beads were prepared as follows: an alginate solution of 2 % w/v was prepared dissolving the sodium alginate in distilled water under stirring. The drug suspension (0. 5 % w/v) was added to the alginate solution. This mix was dropped, from a hypodermic syringe, into 1. 4 % w/v CaCl 2 solution. The gel beads, which formed immediately in the CaCl 2 solution, were incubated at room temperature (22 ºC) and in darkness in this solution for 24 h to ensure complete reaction. After this time, the beads were filtered and dried using microwaves (3200 W) during 110 minutes with 10 % of power. In order to prepare Eudragit FS 30 D/alginate beads, a suspension of the polymer (26 % or 13 % w/v) was added in the mix previously described under agitation, before dropping over a 1. 4 % w/v CaCl 2 solution. Finally, the chitosan/alginate beads were elaborated by adding chitosan (0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 5 % w/v) to distilled water containing 1 % (v/v) acetic acid. The 1. 4 % w/v CaCl 2 solution was added to the chitosan solution. An alginate/drug suspension was added to this solution to form the beads. The beads were incubated and dried under the same conditions as described above. Table 1 shows the composition of the different beads formulations...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT – Purpose: The {{therapeutic}} equivalence {{of multiple}} registered fenofibrate formulations, several {{of which are}} suprabioavailable and therefore marketed at lower dosage strengths than their reference products, {{is based on the}} results of bioequivalence studies. Most of these formulations show a higher bioavailability when taken with a high-fat meal. The relative bioavailability of two of these formulations, the 200 mg Lidose <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> and the 145 mg nanoparticle tablets, was assessed when taken with a high-fat meal. Methods: In this single dose, 2 -way, randomized, crossover study, 24 healthy subjects received a 200 mg fenofibrate Lidose <b>hard</b> <b>capsule</b> (Test) and a 145 mg nanoparticle tablet (Reference) under high-fat fed conditions. Plasma concentrations of fenofibric acid were measured up to 72 hours by using a validated LC-MS/MS method. Results: The geometric mean ratios (Test/Reference) and the 90 % confidence intervals for AUC 0 -t and Cmax were 1. 37 (131. 58 – 142. 88) and 1. 38 (124. 60 – 152. 93), respectively. The median (range) Tmax values of fenofibric acid were 4. 5 h (3. 0 – 8. 0 h) and 3. 25 h (1. 0 – 6. 5 h) after administration of the Lidose <b>hard</b> <b>capsule</b> and the nanoparticle tablet, respectively. Conclusion: Under high-fat fed conditions the extent of fenofibrate absorption was 37 % higher for the 200 mg Lidose <b>hard</b> <b>capsule</b> compared to the 145 mg nanoparticle tablet, which is exactly as expected based on a mg-to-mg weight basis.

Methods: Artificial stomach fluid (ASF) and artificial intestinal fluid (AIF) were prepared. Stability of three types of Xuesaitong capsules was examined for 4  h in stomachs and 24  h in intestines. Samples were analyzed at different times by high-performance liquid chromatography. Percent content of NGR 1, GRg 1, GRb 1, GRe, and GRd at different times was calculated. Results: <b>Hard</b> <b>capsules</b> incubated in ASF disintegrated within 2 – 3  min, whereas soft capsules disintegrated within 7 – 8  min. Components in <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> were dissolved rapidly in water, with content of each compound reaching 90 % in 5  min, and degradation of each compound reaching 30 – 50 % after incubation for 240  min. Dissolution and degradation of each component in soft capsules with a water-soluble base tended to balance at 30 – 90  min. Contents in soft capsules with a lipid-soluble base showed slow dissolution after ASF incubation for 120  min. Five saponins in identical types of capsules incubated in ASF had similar stability curves. Contents of <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> and soft capsules with a water-soluble base degraded rapidly within 30  min and reached a plateau when Xuesaitong capsules were incubated in AIF.

The capsules were irradiated {{in the air at}} 5, 15, and 25 kGy. The deforming work of nonirradiated HPMC capsules (0. 06 ± 0. 01 J) was lower than that of gelatin capsules (0. 10 ± 0. 01 J). The dissolution time of the HPMC capsules (414 ± 33 seconds) was slightly higher than that determined for gelatin <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> (288 ± 19 seconds). The hardness and dissolution time of gelatin and HPMC capsules were not significantly influenced by the irradiation type and the applied irradiation dose.
