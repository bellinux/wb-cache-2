25|$|In 1984, {{two years}} after his father's death, Villeneuve asked his mother if he could follow his father's {{footsteps}} and go motor racing. His mother, Joann, promised she {{would allow him to}} drive a kart if he <b>got</b> <b>good</b> marks in one of his weakest subjects, mathematics. Villeneuve applied himself at school and soon got the marks he required for his mother to fulfill her promise. A year later, Joann allowed him to drive a 100cc kart at a kart track in Imola. The owners of the track, Luigi and Massimo Buratti, were impressed by the Canadian and after proving himself in a 100cc machine, he moved up to the 135cc version before, on the same day, being allowed onto the Grand Prix circuit with a Formula Four car.|$|E
25|$|Rain damaged {{both the}} first and the second day at The County Ground, Hove, and only 93 overs were {{possible}} in two days. Yet, 18 wickets fell on those two days, 14 of which on the second day. Sussex resumed play on the second day with an overnight score of 97 for 4, and immediately lost two wickets to swing bowler Jon Lewis, who ended with four for 62. However, a quick blast of four fours, one six and one single from Jason Lewry lifted Sussex to 191 all out. The Gloucestershire reply never got off the mark, as seven batsmen were out in single figures and the highest partnership was 33. Rana Naved-ul-Hasan <b>got</b> <b>good</b> output with the ball, however, taking four for 26 as Gloucestershire ended on 142.|$|E

25|$|Without any {{permanent}} address, {{the family}} had to spend irregular vagrancy life living {{in the corners of}} their relatives manors in various parts of Sweden. This was in Margit Sandemo's opinion somewhat humiliating. During her time in Sweden, she missed her birthplace in Valdres, Norway, which she still considered her true national place. Also her mother's occupation as a teacher may {{have been one of the}} reasons for moving so often. Margit took her compulsory education in a nine-year girl school, after which she studied in various night schools, as in an art school and was as an auditor in Dramaten. She <b>got</b> <b>good</b> grades, the best for behaviour, even though she took never schooling seriously. Sandemo had a gift for arts as a child. She was skilled at painting, singing, playing and poetry, making her mother very proud. However, she did not have any dreams to become a novelist. Margit spent her childhood summer at the estate of her grandparents in Blekinge.|$|E
25|$|The {{second quarter}} would {{be full of}} missed {{opportunities}} and poor play from both teams. On the first play, a high snap from Bucs center Tony Mayberry went over quarterback Shaun King's head and into the end zone. King managed to knock {{the ball out of}} the end zone to prevent a touchdown, but it gave the Rams a safety and a 5–3 lead. Az-Zahir Hakim returned the free kick 15-yards to the Rams 40-yard line. Hakim also caught a 14-yard pass and ran for six as the team drove to the Bucs 26, but the drive was halted there and Wilkins missed a 44-yard field goal attempt. Following a punt from each team, Tampa Bay also <b>got</b> <b>good</b> field position from a good return, a 14-yard punt return from Karl Williams that gave them a first down on the Rams 45. Although they would drive to the St. Louis 26, they would ultimately fair no better than the Rams did. On third down, King lost a fumble while being sacked by Charlie Clemons. King recovered the ball, but the 13-yard loss pushed the team out of field goal range. The next time Tampa Bay had the ball, King threw a pass from the Rams 41 that went right into the arms of St. Louis defensive back Todd Lyght. A few plays later, the half ended with the score still 5-3, despite the Rams 159–75 advantage over the Buccaneers in total yards.|$|E
500|$|Bolton defender Alan Stubbs was {{confident}} Bolton could cause Liverpool problems: [...] "I {{think if you}} look round the team we have <b>got</b> <b>good</b> quality everywhere and that's why we are doing so well, we have also <b>got</b> <b>good</b> players in reserve who can come in and do a job. We have played together {{for a long time and}} we are strong both mentally and physically this year. And if the forwards have not been scoring, the midfield and wingers have." ...|$|E

500|$|Kinsler was {{promoted}} two levels on June 12 to the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders. [...] "When I first got called up, {{there were a}} million things running through my head", he said. [...] "I was nervous, my hands were sweating. It was really exciting, but I didn't know what to expect. I was a little nervous that ... {{all of a sudden}} I wouldn't be able to hit." [...] In June he was named the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month. Frisco manager Tim Ireland observed: I think he's succeeding because his swing is graceful and effortless. It's just a smooth swing, and he hits for power because he lets his swing work for him. Defensively, so far he's shown a real feel for shortstop. He's <b>got</b> <b>good</b> feet and soft hands, and he throws well enough.... He seems pretty legit to me. In July, the Rangers agreed to send Kinsler and prospect right-hander Erik Thompson to the Colorado Rockies for Larry Walker, but Walker vetoed the trade.|$|E
500|$|As a freshman, Scheyer led Glenbrook North {{in scoring}} and assists and was First Team All-State {{as a sophomore}} in 2004. [...] Scheyer was the only non-senior among those First Team All-State {{selections}} and was the only underclassman {{on any of the}} first three All-State squads. As a junior, he averaged 26 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists. [...] His coach David Weber said: [...] "I call him a combination of Larry Bird and 'Pistol' Pete (Maravich). [...] He's got the flair, the passing abilities. He's <b>got</b> <b>good</b> size. He's a rare player in this day and age." [...] Scheyer rose to national fame in his senior year by scoring 21 points in 75 seconds of play during a one-man comeback effort in the last minute and a half of a high school game against Proviso West High School, {{in an effort to keep}} alive his team's 35-game winning streak. [...] It has been called one of the best performances ever on a high school court. [...] He averaged 32 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, and 3 steals for the Spartans as a senior.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{eventually}} {{learned to}} take care of herself and her siblings, and she turned to her paternal grandmother in the hope of finding some solace and some form of her mother in her. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly {{to take the place of}} their beloved mother. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Madonna commented that she saw herself in her youth as a [...] "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way.

[...] Terrified that her father, Tony Ciccone, could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him. Two years after her mother's death, her father married the family's housekeeper, Joan Gustafson. At this point, Madonna began to express unresolved feelings of anger towards her father that lasted for decades, and developed a rebellious attitude.

500|$|Each offense {{would face}} tough {{defense in the}} air and on the ground. The Virginia Tech defense, led by junior linebackers Vince Hall and Xavier Adibi, was {{expected}} to present a challenge for the Georgia offense. [...] "You try to find some kind of mismatch, but it's very difficult to do", Georgia head coach Mark Richt said before kickoff. [...] "That's why they're the best (defense) in the country. Their interior defensive linemen are very, very strong and physical, and, really, everybody else is built for speed. Their edge rushers are tremendous, and their linebackers are outstanding and physical. Their defensive backs can all run and hit. It's {{going to be a real}} challenge." [...] Of particular concern for quarterback Matt Stafford were Virginia Tech's cornerbacks, whom he would have to go through in order to complete passes to his receivers. [...] "They play kind of a different scheme than a lot of teams so it would be tough if you only had one week to try to prepare for these guys", Stafford said in an interview prior to the game. [...] "They trust their corners a lot, but they've <b>got</b> <b>good</b> ones and can. They lock up a lot of time single receiver side because they've got a good corner down there that plays on the boundary." ...|$|E
500|$|After both teams' first drives ended without points, Eastern Michigan <b>got</b> <b>good</b> field {{position}} {{to start their}} second drive, and attempted a 35-yard field goal, but after a low snap, Penn State defender Jordan Lucas tackled the holder for a loss, and the kick never got off, for a turnover on downs. Penn State failed to capitalize, however, as Hackenberg threw another incomplete pass on third down, starting the game with one completion in five attempts. Eastern Michigan scored first after the ball slipped from Hackenberg's hands and was returned for a touchdown by Hunter Matt for 11 yards, giving Eastern Michigan a 7–0 advantage with 4:01 in the first quarter. Penn State responded on their next drive scoring a touchdown on a 2-yard Zach Zwinak run, capping a 6-play, 67-yard drive that included a 43-yard reception to Allen Robinson to put the ball inside the 10-yard line. Penn State's next drive featured a hurry up offense, which Penn State calls [...] "NASCAR", included 15+ yard completions to Jesse James and Matt Zanellato, and culminated with two consecutive runs by Bill Belton, the latter of which went for a 5-yard touchdown making the score 14–7. Eastern Michigan's ensuing drive had some success, as they got to Penn State 25-yard line prior to kicker Dylan Mulder pushing a 42-yard field goal attempt {{to the right of}} the goal posts. At the end of the first half, Penn State got into field goal range with under a minute to go, and Sam Ficken converted a 39-yard field goal, his Penn State record 14th straight, to make the score 17–7 with 17 seconds in the half. Penn State got the ball to start the second half, but exchanged punts with Eastern Michigan for their first three drives, both teams punting the ball away on their first three drives. [...] On their fourth drive of the half, Penn State got to the board – on a six play drive that included a 20-yard run by Zwinak on 3rd and 24 (after two sacks) and a subsequent fourth down conversion, and then culminated with a 7-yard touchdown run by Zwinak making the score 24–7. After a quick punt, Penn State began to grind it out offensively prior to Hackenberg finding Robinson for a 45-yard touchdown pass to make it 31–7. Later in the quarter, Belton broke loose for a 51-yard touchdown run, putting him over 100 rushing yards on the day making the score 38–7. After Eastern Michigan punted for the 10th time in the game, Penn State brought in Tyler Ferguson at quarterback to replace Hackenberg, who had already amassed 311 passing yards, a Penn State single game freshman record. On that drive, Akeel Lynch became the third Nittany Lion to rush for a touchdown, an 18-yard run with under five minutes to go. That would be the final scoring play of the game; Penn State won 45–7.|$|E
