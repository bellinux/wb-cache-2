5|$|The game's use of The Simpsons-style humor {{received}} a mixed reception. Both GameSpot and GameTrailers {{said that the}} game delivered more than enough laughs to make it worth playing through at least once. It was considered enjoyable for both hardcore and casual The Simpsons fans by IGN and GameDaily, who also called it a particularly appealing game for diehard fans. Despite the few problems that the game had, GameSpy said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> to see the humorous parodies. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, however, believed that the game's humor could only carry it so far, and suggested that those interested in The Simpsons humor should purchase a box set {{of one of the}} television series' seasons instead. Joe Juba of Game Informer called the game an average experience. He elaborated that the game would appeal primarily to fans of the television series, but would not be worth playing for people unfamiliar with it.|$|E
25|$|The Republic of Texas era {{with the}} Indians {{can be divided}} into three phases: the {{diplomacy}} of Houston during his first term, the hostility of Lamar, and the resumed diplomatic efforts of Houston's second term. Sam Houston led the Republic to negotiate with the Comanche. They said they would stop raiding if they were given sufficient amounts of what they considered prerequisites for peaceful relations: gifts, trade, and regular face-to-face diplomacy. Houston, who enjoyed a good reputation among Indians, had married a mixed-race woman of Cherokee descent. He had lived in Indian Territory for years and learned about their cultures. He was willing to meet with the Comanche on their terms and believed, as a matter of policy, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> to buy a few thousand dollars worth of presents. The Republic could not support the huge cost of a standing army for defense, and it {{might not be able to}} defeat the assembled might of the entire Comanche-Kiowa alliance, especially if they received Mexican help.|$|E
25|$|In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis {{stated that}} he at first regretted writing Scar Tissue saying “I did regret the book for a while as there was some pain caused then, I started seeing the long term {{positive}} reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools and it was having a positive effect. I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E

500|$|Rosenbaum's {{return as}} Lex Luthor {{was met with}} {{positive}} critical reception. Jensen felt that Rosenbaum's cameo was too short, but that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> to see him play Lex one last time. Carabott felt that the scene between Lex and Clark was [...] "worth the wait". Dyess-Nugent praised Rosenbaum's acting, arguing that it shook [...] "the show awake, sending the needle hurtling rudely into the red zone". He ultimately stated that Rosenbaum's acting—in both the finale and the series as a whole—was [...] "one of the great TV series performances of the past 10 years and proof once again that talent will blossom in the least expected places".|$|E

2500|$|After a {{brief period}} of leave in Britain during 1958, Burgess took up a further Eastern post, this time at the Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin College in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei. Brunei had been a British {{protectorate}} since 1888, and was not to achieve independence until 1984. In the sultanate, Burgess sketched the novel that, when it was published in 1961, was to be entitled Devil of a State and, although it dealt with Brunei, for libel reasons the action had to be transposed to an imaginary East African territory similar to Zanzibar, named Dunia. In his autobiography Little Wilson and Big God (1987) Burgess wrote:"This novel was, is, about Brunei, which was renamed Naraka, Malay-Sanskrit for 'hell.' Little invention was needed to contrive a large cast of unbelievable characters and a number of interwoven plots. Though completed in 1958, the work was not published until 1961, for what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> was made a choice of the book society. Heinemann, my publisher, was doubtful about publishing it: it might be libellous. I had to change the setting from Brunei to an East African one. Heinemann was right to be timorous. In early 1958, The Enemy in the Blanket appeared and at once provoked a libel suit." ...|$|E

[...] He names [...] "Please Let Me Wonder" [...] as the first song he wrote on pot, with [...] "She Knows Me Too Well" [...] and [...] "Let Him Run Wild" [...] following soon after. Of his first acid trip, he recalls that LSD had subjected him to [...] "a very religious experience" [...] which enlightened him to indescribable philosophies. The music for [...] "California Girls" [...] came from this first LSD experience, as did much of the group's subsequent work where they would partake in drug use during recording sessions. Wilson spoke of his LSD trips as a [...] "religious experience", and during a session for his a cappella hymn [...] "Our Prayer", Brian can be heard asking the other Beach Boys: [...] "Do you guys feel any acid yet?" [...] In 1993, Wilson testified in a legal deposition that by 1965, he was consuming three or four marijuana cigarettes and one LSD pill a day. He believes after he dropped LSD: [...] "It expanded my mind a little bit, so I could write better songs ... <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it,</b> I wouldn't take it again." ...|$|E
