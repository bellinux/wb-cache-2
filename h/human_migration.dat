25|$|Mutation rate {{of human}} genome {{is a very}} {{important}} factor in calculating evolutionary time points. Researchers calculated the number of genetic variations between human and apes. Dividing that number by age of fossil of most recent common ancestor of humans and ape, researchers calculated the mutation rate. Recent studies using next generation sequencing technologies concluded a slow mutation rate which doesn't add up with <b>human</b> <b>migration</b> pattern time points and suggesting a new evolutionary time scale. 100,000 year old human fossils found in Israel have served to compound this new found uncertainty of the <b>human</b> <b>migration</b> timeline.|$|E

25|$|The {{two common}} O alleles, O01 and O02, share their first 261 {{nucleotides}} {{with the group}} A allele A01. However, unlike the group A allele, a guanosine base is subsequently deleted.

The O01 allele is considered to predate the O02 allele.|$|E
