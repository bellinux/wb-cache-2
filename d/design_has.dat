40|$|A {{number of}} {{three-dimensional}} information visualization <b>designs</b> <b>have</b> been invented {{during the last}} years. However, comparisons of such <b>designs</b> <b>have</b> been scarce, {{making it difficult for}} application developers to select a suitable design. This paper reports on a case study where three existing visualization <b>designs</b> <b>have</b> been implemented and evaluated. We found that the three information visualization <b>designs</b> <b>have</b> inherent problems when used for visualizing different data sets, and that certain tasks can not be supported by the designs. We propose a multi-visualization view to overcome these problems. Finally, the paper also introduces heuristics for selecting information visualization designs...|$|R

5|$|Nucleic acid <b>design</b> <b>has</b> similar {{goals to}} protein design. In both, the {{sequence}} of monomers is designed to favor the desired target structure and to disfavor other structures. Nucleic acid <b>design</b> <b>has</b> {{the advantage of being}} much computationally easier than protein design, because the simple base pairing rules are sufficient to predict a structure's energetic favorability, and detailed information about the overall three-dimensional folding of the structure is not required. This allows the use of simple heuristic methods that yield experimentally robust designs. Nucleic acid structures are less versatile than proteins in their function because of proteins' increased ability to fold into complex structures, and the limited chemical diversity of the four nucleotides as compared to the twenty proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Red, {{white and}} blue have been the colours of every jersey design in the club's history; however, the jersey <b>design</b> <b>has</b> {{undergone}} several alterations. The red, {{white and blue}} colour scheme has traditionally been the colour combination of sporting teams representing Sydney's Eastern Suburbs. Eastern Suburbs Rugby League club adopted these colours in 1908, with its predecessor Rugby Union club, also known as Eastern Suburbs in the Sydney club Rugby Union, having played in the tri-colours. The jersey worn in the first premiership season consisted of several hoops; red stripes dominated over consecutive smaller white and blue stripes. Although the width and the order of these stripes have changed, the basic <b>design</b> <b>has</b> always been maintained.|$|E

Simulations have been used to optimize fin design performance.|$|R
5000|$|Critics of the Red Peak Flag <b>design</b> <b>have</b> noted {{it bears}} a {{resemblance}} to corporate logos. Red Peak's opponents sought {{to use the}} similarities between the flag design and the logos of Peak Engineering & Design of Apex, North Carolina, and Arrow Uniforms of New Zealand to scuttle the flag's bid for a referendum spot. Supporters of the <b>design</b> <b>have</b> dismissed this tactic as both culturally insensitive and a [...] "red herring" [...] (given the <b>designs</b> <b>have</b> different colour and form).|$|R

5|$|The castles of the Mary Rose had {{additional}} decks, {{but since}} virtually nothing of them survives, their <b>design</b> <b>has</b> {{had to be}} reconstructed from historical records. Contemporary ships of equal size were consistently listed as having three decks in both castles. Although speculative, this layout {{is supported by the}} illustration in the Anthony Roll and the gun inventories.|$|E
5|$|The hotel's {{exterior}} façade {{was inspired}} by the Louis XII wing of the Château de Blois. Since its construction, dormers have been added and the window <b>design</b> <b>has</b> changed. The original façade {{can be seen in the}} decoration of some ground-floor windows and the portal, and the walls, windows and corbels of this hôtel particulier are in the Gothic style.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study of the qualitative aspects of plasma facing component (PFC) reliability for actively cooled solid wall and liquid wall concepts for magnetic fusion reactor vessels. These two <b>designs</b> <b>have</b> been analyzed for component failure modes. The most important results of that study are given here. A brief discussion of reliability growth in design is included to illustrate how solid wall <b>designs</b> <b>have</b> begun as workable <b>designs</b> and <b>have</b> evolved over time to become more optimized designs with better longevity. The increase in tolerable heat fluxes shows the improvement. Liquid walls could also have reliability growth if the <b>designs</b> <b>had</b> similar development efforts...|$|R

The house was constructed in 1708 as Dummer's family home, and its <b>design</b> <b>has</b> been attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor.

5|$|In 1888, Darlington's kit {{consisted}} of a shirt with black and white vertical stripes, black shorts and black socks. Apart from a period between the 1910s and 1936, when blue shorts were worn, the basic colours of the home kit have remained black and white. The shirt <b>design</b> <b>has</b> varied, from the 1888 vertical stripes, through hoops, plain white, and back to hoops again in the 1990s. Sponsors' names have appeared on Darlington's shirts since the 1980s. A table of kit manufacturers (since the 1970s) and shirt sponsors appears on the right.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, predating Booth's attempt, WMATA {{released}} a professionally designed graphic that displayed the Silver Line on an unofficial map that resembled the current version, but with thin lines. The interplay between Metro's unofficial proposal {{and those of}} other designers received attention in a number of press outlets. A poster displaying a map of similar <b>design</b> <b>has</b> been hanging in DC Councilman Jack Evans' office for a number of years, but received scant attention until 2008. Wyman, one of the original designers of the map, was confirmed as the layout specialist who would be redesigning the map by the Washington Post on June 4, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Innovation {{policies}} have been excessively focused on the supply of technologies, neglecting the demand side (the user). There have been several initiatives by the European Commission to support and research design and design management in recent years. However, a European-wide policy to support <b>design</b> <b>has</b> never been planned, due to the inconsistencies and differences in design policies in each nation. Nonetheless, there are currently plans to include design in the EU innovation policy.|$|E

5|$|Quarry House was {{constructed}} {{on the site}} of the former Quarry Hill Flats (see 1920s and 1930s) at Quarry Hill. The building houses the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions and is their main regional offices. The building is controversial. Its imposing <b>design</b> <b>has</b> often been regarded as being domineering and self-important and has led the building to be nicknamed The Kremlin and The Ministry of Truth.|$|E
5|$|Tailors {{started to}} take {{premises}} around Savile Row in the late 18th century, first in Cork Street, about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself. In 1846, Henry Poole, credited as creator of the dinner jacket or tuxedo, opened an entrance at 37 Savile Row from his late father's tailoring premises at 4 Old Burlington Street. As tailoring moved into the street, the house frontages were altered to bring natural light into the tailors' working area {{with the addition of}} glass frontages and light wells. The houses have been much altered over time; the original Burlingtonian <b>design</b> <b>has</b> been mostly lost, though No. 14 still retains much of the original external features.|$|E

Since 2009, the current ball has been displayed atop the building year-round, while the original, smaller version of the current ball that was used in 2008 is on display at Times Square's visitor center.|$|E
