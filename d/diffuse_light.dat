5|$|A yellowish-brown pigment is {{diffused}} {{through the}} cytosol of the hyphae and is much deeper in color {{just below the}} cuticle of the cap. In very young fruit bodies, stems and caps are very pale buff, but soon {{the color of the}} cap deepens and becomes cinnamon. The intensity of the color appears to be dependent on light, for when fruit bodies are grown in <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> (temperature and humidity being constant) they are a uniform pale buff color, but in bright light they are cinnamon or tan.|$|E
25|$|Lighting {{instruments}} can be broadly {{separated into}} two categories: floodlights, which illuminate a wide area, and spotlights (sometimes known as profiles), which produce a narrower, more controllable light beam. The distinction {{has to do}} with the characteristics of the light produced by the instrument. Spotlights produce a potentially tightly focused light, while floodlights produce a much more <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> Instruments that fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum can be classified as either a spot or a flood, depending on the type of instrument and how it is used.|$|E
25|$|Van Eyck {{used the}} {{technique}} of applying layer after layer of thin translucent glazes to create a painting with an intensity of both tone and colour. The glowing colours also help to highlight the realism, and to show the material wealth and opulence of Arnolfini's world. Van Eyck {{took advantage of the}} longer drying time of oil paint, compared to tempera, to blend colours by painting wet-in-wet to achieve subtle variations in light and shade to heighten the illusion of three-dimensional forms. The medium of oil paint also permitted van Eyck to capture surface appearance and distinguish textures precisely. He also rendered the effects of both direct and <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> by showing the light from the window on the left reflected by various surfaces. It has been suggested that he used a magnifying glass in order to paint the minute details such as the individual highlights on each of the amber beads hanging beside the mirror.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A new surface {{radiance}} {{model for}} <b>diffuse</b> <b>lighting</b> is presented which incorporates shadows, interreflections, and surface orientation.

Index Terms—Shape-from-shading, <b>diffuse</b> <b>lighting,</b> interreflections, shadows, visual events, horizon, skyline. ...|$|R

2500|$|OLED {{technology}} {{is used in}} commercial applications such as displays for mobile phones and portable digital media players, car radios and digital cameras among others, as well as lighting. Such portable display applications favor the high light output of OLEDs for readability in sunlight and their low power drain. Portable displays are also used intermittently, so the lower lifespan of organic displays is less of an issue. Prototypes have been made of flexible and rollable displays which use OLEDs' unique characteristics. Applications in flexible signs and lighting are also being developed. OLED lighting offers several advantages over LED lighting, such as higher quality illumination, more <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> source, and panel shapes. [...] Philips Lighting have made OLED lighting samples under the brand name [...] "Lumiblade" [...] available online and Novaled AG based in Dresden, Germany, introduced a line of OLED desk lamps called [...] "Victory" [...] in September, 2011.|$|E
