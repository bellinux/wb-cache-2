50|$|Field-effect {{transistors}} (FET) {{are another}} type of transistor which amplify current implementing extrinsic semiconductors. As opposed to BJTs, they are called unipolar because they involve single carrier type operationeither N-channel or P-channel. FETs are broken into two families, junction gate FET (JFET), which are three terminal semiconductors, and <b>insulated</b> <b>gate</b> <b>FET</b> (IGFET), which are four terminal semiconductors.|$|E
50|$|FETs {{are divided}} into two families: {{junction}} FET (JFET) and <b>insulated</b> <b>gate</b> <b>FET</b> (IGFET). The IGFET is more commonly known as a metal-oxide-semiconductor FET (MOSFET), reflecting its original construction from layers of metal (the gate), oxide (the insulation), and semiconductor. Unlike IGFETs, the JFET gate forms a p-n diode with the channel which lies between the source and drain. Functionally, this makes the n-channel JFET the solid-state equivalent of the vacuum tube triode which, similarly, forms a diode between its grid and cathode. Also, both devices operate in the depletion mode, they both have a high input impedance, and they both conduct current {{under the control of}} an input voltage.|$|E
50|$|The MESFET {{differs from}} the common <b>insulated</b> <b>gate</b> <b>FET</b> or MOSFET in {{that there is no}} {{insulator}} under the gate over the active switching region. This implies that the MESFET gate should, in transistor mode, be biased such that one does not have a forward-conducting metal-semiconductor diode instead of a reversed-biased depletion zone controlling the underlying channel. While this restriction inhibits certain circuit possibilities as the gate must remain reverse-biased and cannot therefore exceed a certain voltage of forward bias, MESFETs analog and digital devices work reasonably well if kept within the confines of design limits. The most critical aspect of the design is the gate metal extent over the switching region. Generally the narrower the gate modulated carrier channel the better the frequency handling abilities, overall. Spacing of the source and drain with respect to the gate, and the lateral extent of the gate are important though somewhat less critical design parameters. MESFET current handling ability improves as the gate is elongated laterally, keeping the active region constant, however is limited by phase shift along the gate due to the transmission line effect. As a result, most production MESFETs use a built up top layer of low resistance metal on the gate, often producing a mushroom-like profile in cross section.|$|E
50|$|In logic gates, logical {{functions}} are performed by parallel or series connected switches (such as relay contacts or <b>insulated</b> <b>gate</b> <b>FETs</b> like CMOS) controlled by logical inputs or parallel resistors or diodes which are passive components. Diode logic is implemented by diodes which exhibit low impedance when forward biased {{and a very}} high impedance when reverse biased. There {{are two kinds of}} diode logic gates - OR and AND. It is not possible to construct NOT (Invert) diode gates because the NOT or Invert function requires an active component such as a transistor.|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} types of hydrogen response signals (DC and AC) of a proton-pumping <b>gate</b> <b>FET</b> with triple layer gate structure (Pd/proton conducting polymer/Pt) were obtained.

30|$|The {{advancement}} {{of technology to}} make micro-mechanical structure using semiconductor fabrication processes leads the application of electrical components including transistors, capacitors, and inductors for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In terms of integration with electronics, silicon-based MEMS have gained much attention due to the potential applications in wireless communication system, mobile device, structural health monitoring system, etc. [6, 7, 8]. One of the active electronic devices for sensing elements is movable gate field effect transistors (<b>FET),</b> whose <b>gate</b> is released from the substrate and free to move [9, 10, 11, 12]. The MOSFET-type device contains dielectric layer to electrically <b>insulate</b> between <b>gate</b> electrode and substrate embedding source and drain of <b>FET.</b> The movable <b>gate</b> <b>FET</b> uses air gap as an insulator or a dielectric layer of the FET. The use of air layer allows the gate to move laterally along the channel of FET or vertically to the substrate by external forces such as acceleration or pressure. The former is called the laterally movable <b>gate</b> <b>FET</b> (LMGFET), and the latter is called the vertically movable <b>gate</b> <b>FET</b> (VMGFET) [12, 13]. The oscillation frequency of the sensing element is simply converted to electrical output without additional circuitry. In this paper, a micro-accelerometer using VMGFET is introduced, applicable for low-frequency vibration measurement (< 500  Hz).|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} an active gate drive (AGD) {{technology}} for high-power <b>insulated</b> <b>gate</b> bipolar transistors (IGBT’s). It {{is based on}} an optimal combination of several requirements necessary for good switching performance under hard-switching conditions. The scheme specifically combines together the slow drive requirements for low noise and switching stress and the fast drive requirements for high-speed switching and low switching energy loss. The gate drive can also effectively dampen oscillations during low-current turn-on transient in the IGBT. This paper looks at the conflicting requirements of the conventional gate drive circuit design and demonstrates using experimental results that the proposed three-stage AGD technique can be an effective solution.
