5|$|The {{main event}} was between A.J. Styles and Abyss, {{in which the}} winner {{received}} an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match at Hard Justice. Its duration was 18 minutes even. The match began on the outside as Styles performed a front-flip onto Abyss, who {{was standing in the}} doorway of the cage. Later, as Styles was about to enter the cage, Abyss slammed the door twice into Styles, while the second <b>door</b> <b>slam</b> the second hit him in the face and caused him to crash to the floor and to bleed from the forehead. During the contest, Abyss used a steel chain as a weapon to help open up Styles' wound more. At one point, Abyss opened a bag and poured a large number of thumbtacks onto the mat, then proceeding to try to slam Styles into them. Styles countered and slammed Abyss face-first into the tacks instead with his signature maneuver, the Styles Clash. Near the end of the contest, Styles climbed the steel cage and stood on the top, but Abyss grabbed and threw the referee into the cage wall, causing Styles to fall and barely hang on. Abyss then followed by climbing the cage and by hanging Styles by the neck for a brief time with the steel chain. Then, Styles performed a sunset flip powerbomb and slammed Abyss into the tacks back-first. He followed by covering for the three count, winning of the encounter and earning his future title match.|$|E

2500|$|Although operant and {{classical}} conditioning both involve behaviors controlled by environmental stimuli, they differ in nature. In operant conditioning, stimuli present when a behavior is rewarded or punished come to control that behavior. [...] For example, {{a child may}} learn to open a box to get the candy inside, or learn to avoid touching a hot stove; in operant terms, the box and the stove are [...] "discriminative stimuli". However, in classical conditioning, stimuli that signal significant events produce reflexive behavior. For example, sight of candy may cause a child to salivate, or {{the sound of a}} <b>door</b> <b>slam</b> may signal an angry parent, causing a child to tremble. Salivation and trembling are not operants; they are not reinforced by their consequences.|$|E
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>slammed</b> behind him. Mr. Parker {{turned toward}} the inspector.|$|R
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>slammed</b> violently {{and left}} him exchanging grins with Mr. Jobson.|$|R
60|$|A <b>door</b> <b>slammed</b> {{above their}} heads. Some one {{had left the}} music gallery.|$|R
60|$|Tommy, {{climbing}} courageously, {{heard the}} <b>door</b> <b>slam,</b> and looking down he saw--a strange child. He climbed no higher. It had come.|$|E
60|$|Without {{another word}} Bobbie turned round and left them. Lady Kelsey heard the <b>door</b> <b>slam</b> {{as he went}} out into the silent street.|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh! See {{the light}} in that cabin? An' in that one over there? An' hear that <b>door</b> <b>slam?</b> Oh, sure Dawson's asleep. Them lights? Just buryin' their dead. They ain't stampedin', betcher life they ain't." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went into}} the hotel and when the <b>door</b> <b>slammed</b> Jim was thoughtful.|$|R
5000|$|Rhys Ifans {{advertising}} the channel door-to-door, but often having a <b>door</b> <b>slammed</b> in his face.|$|R
60|$|Then a <b>door</b> <b>slammed</b> and Old Bill Belllounds appeared, {{his hair}} upstanding, his look and gait proclaiming {{him on the}} rampage.|$|R
60|$|Miller {{took his}} {{departure}} {{with a smile}} of evil triumph upon his thin lips. He had his moment of discomfiture, however, when Dartrey coldly ignored his extended hand. The two men left behind heard the <b>door</b> <b>slam.</b>|$|E
60|$|At last, {{when it was}} twelve, {{she heard}} Mr. Budd go out; she heard the <b>door</b> <b>slam.</b> Dempster had not moved. Was he asleep? Would he forget? The minute seemed long, while, with a {{quickening}} pulse, {{she was on the}} stretch to catch every sound.|$|E
60|$|Jack let the <b>door</b> <b>slam</b> after him, {{went out}} and felt that it had shut firmly, and then resumed his seat in his niche. He whistled for a bit, and then his {{thoughts}} turned to the learning which he had determined firmly to acquire.|$|E
60|$|A <b>door</b> <b>slammed,</b> {{rattling}} the thin partition {{between the two}} rooms, and heavy footsteps dragged {{in the hall and}} on the stairway.|$|R
6000|$|This {{last was}} {{directed}} {{at the head of}} the amazed porter, who, as the <b>door</b> <b>slammed</b> in his face, nodded solemnly and remarked: ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>doors</b> <b>slammed</b> {{all along}} the passages. The dreadful issue was joined. I softly crossed the hall and looked into Sarah Walker's room.|$|R
6000|$|There was a moment's breathless silence {{through the}} house. The scene in {{itself was a}} little beyond {{anything}} that the audience had expected. Sophy, who had been leaning {{over the edge of}} the box, turned around in no little anxiety. She heard the <b>door</b> <b>slam.</b> John had disappeared! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So far, so good, Percy!" [...] Ralph said, {{when they}} heard the street <b>door</b> <b>slam,</b> as the orderly left. [...] "Hitherto we have had the most {{extraordinary}} good fortune and, as it's going to snow--for I felt a few flakes, as we came along--I look upon it as good as done." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Crowley remembered Dick's {{surmise that}} Lady Kelsey had loved Fred Allerton, and she {{wondered}} {{how much of the}} old feeling still remained. She felt a great pity for the kind, unselfish creature. Lady Kelsey started as she heard the street <b>door</b> <b>slam.</b> But it was only George who entered.|$|E
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>slammed</b> violently, and Saxon, ere {{she fell}} to crying again, {{could hear her}} {{sister-in-law}} lumbering about the kitchen and talking loudly to herself.|$|R
60|$|In this wise {{the lamb}} was helped into her jacket {{and led to}} the slaughter. Then the <b>door</b> <b>slammed,</b> and they gazed woefully upon the deserted table.|$|R
50|$|The song {{ends with}} the sound of a <b>door</b> <b>slamming.</b> According to {{producer}} Jeff Lynne, this was a metal fire door at Musicland Studios where the song was recorded.|$|R
60|$|Finally {{he heard}} a distant <b>door</b> <b>slam.</b> Then {{he heard a}} whistle, a merry whistle. It drew nearer and nearer; Farmer Brown's boy was coming to feed the hens. Reddy tried to hold his breath. He heard the click of the henyard gate as Farmer Brown's boy opened it, then he heard the crunch, crunch, crunch of Farmer Brown's boy's feet on the snow.|$|E
60|$|He heard a <b>door</b> <b>slam,</b> and {{instantly}} craned out {{his neck to}} look back. He knew that slam so well. Behold! out of the haberdasher's door a small, untidy figure in homely pink print had shot resolutely into the road, and was sprinting in pursuit. In a dozen seconds she was abreast of the bus. At {{the sight of her}} Kipps' heart began to beat very quickly, but he made no immediate motion of recognition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray excuse me," [...] {{said her}} father, coldly, [...] "I feel that I am intruding. I {{did not know}} that you were entertaining. Perhaps you will kindly let me know when you have finished. You will find me in my study." [...] He ignored the two young men completely, and, closing the door, retired, deeply hurt and mortified, to his room. A quarter of an hour {{afterwards}} he heard the <b>door</b> <b>slam,</b> and his two daughters came to announce that the guests were gone.|$|E
6000|$|After the <b>door</b> <b>slammed,</b> Sanford {{took the}} sheet from the {{envelope}} and reread it. At length he dropped into his chair. [...] "That settles it," [...] he said aloud.|$|R
60|$|Saxton {{said nothing}} whatever, but the <b>door</b> <b>slammed</b> behind him, and Brooke, who, {{in spite of}} Devine's protests, {{went back to the}} Dayspring that evening, never saw him again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall," [...] ejaculated Lingard. He {{left the}} cabin calling out [...] "serang!" [...] A thin cracked voice was heard {{immediately}} answering, [...] "Tuan!" [...] and the <b>door</b> <b>slammed</b> to.|$|R
60|$|In {{another minute}} Harry heard the <b>door</b> <b>slam,</b> {{and then he}} felt himself being carried {{steadily}} along, his weight being as nothing to the smuggler. Not a word was spoken {{between the two men}} on their way down to the shore. Presently Harry felt by the deadened sound of the footsteps, and by the more uneven motion, that he was being carried over the sandy slopes down {{to the edge of the}} sea, and through the canvas he could hear the loud roar of the waves, which were now breaking violently.|$|E
60|$|At {{once the}} door swung open, its great hinges making a groaning sound as if in protest, so Woot leaped down and {{followed}} his companions into a big, bare hallway. Scarcely were the three inside, however, {{when they heard the}} <b>door</b> <b>slam</b> shut behind them, and this astonished them because no one had touched it. It had closed of its own accord, as if by magic. Moreover, the latch was on the outside, and the thought occurred to each one of them that they were now prisoners in this unknown castle.|$|E
60|$|Josiah turned obediently. He {{heard the}} <b>door</b> <b>slam</b> {{as he went}} down the walk. As in a {{nightmare}} he opened the gate he had opened ten thousand times and stepped out on the sidewalk. He felt dazed. Surely it was a dream. Very soon he would wake up {{with a sigh of}} relief. He rubbed his forehead and paused indecisively. The monotonous complaint of the bucksaw came to his ears. If that boy had any of the old Childs spirit in him, sooner or later he'd run away. Agatha was beyond the endurance of human flesh. She had not changed, unless for the worse, if such a thing were possible. That boy would surely run for it, maybe soon. Maybe now.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>door</b> <b>slammed</b> to, and I locked it. I {{glanced up}} and was grateful, {{to the bottom of}} my heart, to see that my owner was still my prisoner. I said: ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>slammed</b> behind him. For a long minute {{there was}} silence. The man {{continued}} {{in the same position}} on the bed. The woman sat on the grub- box, facing him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Go,' said Ian. And the raven gave a bob and a hop, {{and thought}} he was quite safe, but the <b>door</b> <b>slammed</b> on a feather of his tail, and he screamed loudly.|$|R
