40|$|The {{counting}} of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subsets</b> of {{a finite}} set {{is of great}} interest in both practical and theoretical contexts in Mathematics. We have used some counting techniques such as the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion and the Mõbius Inversion to enumerate the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subsets</b> of a finite set satisfying different conditions. These two techniques are interdependent with the M¨obius inversion generalizing the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. The enumeration is carried out each time we redefine new conditions on the set. In this study one of our aims is the recognition and identification of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subsets</b> with same features, characteristics or conditions. To facilitate such a study, we use some ideas such as the Hamming distance, mid-point between two <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subsets</b> and cardinality of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subsets.</b> Finally we introduce the fuzzy scanner of elements of a finite set. This is used to identify elements and <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subsets</b> of a set. The scanning process of identification and recognition facilitates the choice of entities with specified properties.

5000|$|The {{notions of}} a [...] "decidable subset" [...] and [...] "recursively {{enumerable}} subset" [...] are basic ones for classical mathematics and classical logic. Thus {{the question of}} a suitable extension of them to fuzzy set theory is a crucial one. A first proposal in such a direction was made by E.S. Santos by the notions of fuzzy Turing machine, Markov normal fuzzy algorithm and fuzzy program (see Santos 1970). Successively, L. Biacino and G. Gerla argued that the proposed definitions are rather questionable. For example, in [...] one shows that the fuzzy Turing machines are not adequate for fuzzy language theory since there are natural fuzzy languages intuitively computable that cannot be recognized by a fuzzy Turing Machine. Then, they proposed the following definitions. Denote by Ü the set of rational numbers in 0,1. Then a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subset</b> s : S 0,1 of a set S is recursively enumerable if a recursive map h : S×N Ü exists such that, for every x in S, the function h(x,n) is increasing with respect to n and s(x) = lim h(x,n).We say that s is decidable if both s and its complement -s are recursively enumerable. An extension of such a theory to the general case of the L-subsets is possible (see Gerla 2006).The proposed definitions are well related with fuzzy logic. Indeed, the following theorem holds true (provided that the deduction apparatus of the considered fuzzy logic satisfies some obvious effectiveness property).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the theory and}} algorithms of distance transform for fuzzy subsets, called fuzzy distance transform (FDT). The notion of fuzzy distance is formulated by first defining {{the length of a}} path on a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subset</b> and then finding the infimum of the lengths of all paths between two points. The length of a path π in a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subset</b> of the n-dimensional continuous space ℜ n is defined as the integral of fuzzy membership values along π. Generally, there are infinitely many paths between any two points in a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subset</b> and it is shown that the shortest one may not exist. The fuzzy distance between two points is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all paths between them. It is demonstrated that, unlike in hard convex sets, the shortest path (when it exists) between two points in a fuzzy convex subset is not necessarily a straight line segment. For any positive number θ ≤ 1, the θ-support of a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subset</b> is the set of all points in ℜ n with membership values {{greater than or equal to}} θ. It is shown that, for any <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subset,</b> for any nonzero θ ≤ 1, fuzzy distance is a metric for the interior of its θ-support. It is also shown that, for any smooth <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subset,</b> fuzzy distance is a metric for the interior of its 0 -support (referred to as support). FDT is defined as a process on a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subset</b> that assigns to a point its fuzzy distance from the complement of the support. The theoretical framework of FDT in continuous space is extended to digital cubic spaces and it is shown that for any fuzzy digital object, fuzzy distance is a metric for the support of the object. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A new {{scheme to}} obtain optimal <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subsets</b> and rules is proposed.

The effectiveness of this genetic formulation enables the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subsets</b> and rules to be optimally reduced and, yet, the system performance is well maintained. In this paper, the details of formulation of the genetic structure are given. The required procedures for coding the fuzzy membership function and rules into the chromosome are also described. To justify this approach to fuzzy logic design, the proposed scheme is applied to control a constant water pressure pumping system. The obtained results, as well as the associated final <b>fuzzy</b> <b>subsets,</b> are included in this paper.
