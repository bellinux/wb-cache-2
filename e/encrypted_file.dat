25|$|KeePass Password Safe is a {{free and}} {{open-source}} password manager primarily for Windows. It officially supports macOS and Linux operating systems {{through the use of}} Mono. Additionally, there are several unofficial ports for Windows Phone, Android, iOS, and BlackBerry devices. KeePass stores usernames, passwords, and other fields, including free-form notes and file attachments, in an <b>encrypted</b> <b>file.</b> This file can be protected by a master password, key file, and/or the current Windows account details. By default, the KeePass database is stored on a local file system (as opposed to cloud storage).|$|E
25|$|In 1995, {{the company}} began to develop network {{encryption}} technologies, again {{in response to a}} growing number of similar requests from its customers. Early products in this sphere included PowerTelnet which is comparable to today's ssh, and PowerFTP, which provided <b>encrypted</b> <b>file</b> transfer. In February 1996, Freedman realized that this technology could be generalized, resulting in a general-purpose network encryption solution that would encrypt the traffic of any application, without requiring much, if any, modification to that application. Chmilar, Huxley, and Lowe worked hard to prepare a demonstrable version of this new CipherLink product in time for the Networld+Interop trade show in April, 1996. The product was well received, and became a finalist for the Best Product of Show award at the trade show that year.|$|E

2500|$|EFS {{works by}} {{encrypting}} a file with a bulk symmetric key, {{also known as}} the File Encryption Key, or FEK. It uses a symmetric encryption algorithm because it takes less time to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data than if an asymmetric key cipher is used. [...] The symmetric encryption algorithm used will vary depending on the version and configuration of the operating system; see Algorithms used by Windows version below. [...] The FEK (the symmetric key that is used to encrypt the file) is then encrypted with a public key that is associated with the user who encrypted the file, and this encrypted FEK is stored in the $EFS alternate data stream of the <b>encrypted</b> <b>file.</b> To decrypt the file, the EFS component driver uses the private key that matches the EFS digital certificate (used to encrypt the file) to decrypt the symmetric key that is stored in the $EFS stream. The EFS component driver then uses the symmetric key to decrypt the file. Because the encryption & decryption operations are performed at a layer below NTFS, it is transparent to the user and all their applications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Many {{organizations}} have {{great deal of}} confidential information which is stored on computers. Such information is desired to be kept securely yet giving a convenience of accessibility from {{any part of the}} world. For data security, one can use an <b>encrypting</b> <b>file</b> system such as eCryptfs [1], dmCrypt [2], File Vault [3]. However these <b>encrypting</b> <b>file</b> systems do not address the problem of accessing files over network from public computers. In this case the public host, the actual FileServer host and the network between them are vulnerable to many attacks. This paper discusses the major problems and proposes a solution for the same using TransCrypt [4] <b>encrypting</b> <b>file</b> system. It also describes how the proposed solution can be implemented on a Linux-based environment...|$|R
50|$|Convergent {{encryption}} derives the {{key from}} the file content itself and means an identical <b>file</b> <b>encrypted</b> on different computers result in identical <b>encrypted</b> <b>files.</b> This enables the cloud storage provider to de-duplicate data blocks, meaning only one instance {{of a unique}} file (such as a document, photo, music or movie file) is actually stored on the cloud servers but made accessible to all uploaders. A third party who gained access to the <b>encrypted</b> <b>files</b> could thus easily determine if a user has uploaded a particular <b>file</b> simply by <b>encrypting</b> it themselves and comparing the outputs.|$|R
