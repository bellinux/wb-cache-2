40|$|Food {{habits of}} moose (Alces alces) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) overlap in {{northern}} New Hampshire during autumn and winter. High moose and deer densities in <b>deer</b> <b>yards,</b> where <b>deer</b> may be confined for extended periods, {{could result in}} competition for limited deciduous forage. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate possible impacts by moose on browse availability in <b>deer</b> <b>yards,</b> and the potential effects on <b>deer.</b> Fifteen <b>deer</b> <b>yards</b> were studied in northern New Hampshire during spring and fall, 1990 - 91. Unbrowsed and browsed deciduous twigs, and deer and moose pellet groups were counted on 900 permanent plots to measure seasonal browse use and population density of deer and moose. Twig biomass availability and removal were estimated for each season in all areas. Combined data from all <b>deer</b> <b>yards</b> showed that unbrowsed biomass increased between spring 1990 and autumn 1990, and decreased between autumn 1990 and spring 1991. Moose browsed 7. 2 % of available food during autumn 1989 and winter 1990, 7. 7 % during autumn 1990, and 3. 8 % during winter 1991, accounting for 26. 3 %, 81. 1 %, and 17. 6 % of browsed biomass, respectively. One-year-old clearcuts adjacent to wintering areas were heavily browsed, particularly during the winter. Preferred moose foods during autumn were quaking aspen and mountain maple. Pin cherry and nannyberry were removed relative to availability. Moose have the potential to substantially reduce the availability of preferred deciduous browse (e. g. maples) of deer, and thus reduce the carrying capacity of <b>deer</b> <b>yards.</b> Specialized management in areas of high moose density may be warranted where clearcuts adjacent to <b>deer</b> <b>yards</b> provide the essential winter forage of deer...|$|R
40|$|Mapping {{habitats}} {{suitable for}} <b>deer</b> <b>yards</b> using Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) digital data {{has proven to}} be a valuable tool in New Hampshire. By knowing the requirements for <b>deer</b> <b>yards</b> in conjunction with the forest types of an area, considerable time and money can be saved by the game biologist locating <b>deer</b> <b>yards.</b> The procedure used is a relatively simple one. Landsat classification maps are generated for various towns using softwood, hardwood, mixed wood, open, and water categories. The maps are then used by the biologists to field check every softwood area on the classification map, softwood areas being important to the deer for protection from heavy snow. Having located the <b>deer</b> <b>yards,</b> efforts can commence to protect them through various methods insuring a healthy deer population with budget cuts effecting all sectors of the economy, time saving procedures will have to be implemented. A healthy deer herd has implications that benefit the State financially as well as aesthetically. The technique of mapping forest types is not a new one, however, using this information and applying it to related areas can save considerable time and money...|$|R

Alec acted as spokesman, speaking the patois of the Canuck or French Canadian fluently, while the Frenchman spoke English but little, and that very brokenly. Alec repeated his previously made charges of theft from the traps, and also of illegal poaching in the <b>deer</b> <b>yard,</b> to all of which Pierre shrugged his shoulders indifferently. Then speaking slowly, that every word might sink in, Alec charged him with being an accomplice to attempted murder and the theft of the black fox.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a deer yard," [...] replied Pat. [...] "A <b>deer</b> <b>yard</b> is a {{place where}} the deer tramp out paths in the snow and spend the winter. It is made where they get both shelter and food. When the first deep snow comes they collect in such a place and start the paths while {{browsing}} for food. Then as the snow gets deeper they follow the same paths because it is easier going, and make new paths only when they have to to reach new food supplies. By continually using these paths they keep them open and manage to pick up a living browsing on twigs and pawing down to the ground moss. By the time the heaviest snows come they can't very well get out if they want to, especially when there is a crust like this. You see some of those paths are two to three feet deep. The more plentiful the feed and the smaller the herd the smaller the yard. Before there were any laws to protect deer and moose they used to be slaughtered in the yards by trappers and lumber jacks because it is no trick at all for a man on snow-shoes to run them down. Once get them frightened so that they break out of the yard and they can be run down in no time. There's a deal of poaching goes on now when a yard is discovered near a lumber camp. It's just plain murder and nothing less. I've known a whole family of moose, bull, cow, yearling and calf, to be wiped out in one day by a bloody-minded game-hog. Didn't even waste a shot on the calf, but ran it down and cut its throat. Red Pete, the brute Walt helped to put in the pen the first year he came up here, used to make a business of locating deer yards and keeping lumber camps supplied with fresh meat all winter. The poor critters haven't even a running chance for their lives." ...|$|E

Therefore, this study was aimed at highlighting the diet provided to the <b>deer</b> in back <b>yard</b> husbandry model in Manokwari. Survey method was approached by visiting eight <b>deer</b> back <b>yard</b> farmer respondents. Direct observation to the feeding site and semi-structured interview were carried out {{to learn about the}} deer management system, and identify the forage diet species consumed and served to the animals. The results indicated five most common forage species consumed in the study; they were field grass, Imperata (Imperata cylindrica), elephant grass (Penisetum purpureum), king grass (Penisetum purpureopoidhes) and Melinis minutiflora depending on the location of farmed deer. Drinking water was offered and feed supplement such as various leafs, food and vegetable left over and banana peel was provided by 62. 5 % of the respondents. Food supplement was given two times per day (morning, evening) and (afternoon, evening).

40|$|Regeneration {{success of}} canopy dominants {{is linked to}} {{multiple}} factors, including the ability of their seedlings to survive browsing and to utilize available resources in the understory. In remnant upland northern white cedar Thuja occidentalis L. forests, eects of browsing on recruitment of cedar seedlings were evaluated at 7 sites, including known <b>deer</b> <b>yards,</b> located on {{a portion of the}} Lake Superior Highlands in northeastern Minnesota. Experimental plantings and vegetation surveys were conducted inside and outside large deer exclosures constructed between 1937 and 1997. Objectives were to determine severity and intensity of browsing by Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman, the ability of seedlings to survive browsing in environments beneath T. occidentalis and adja-cent paper birch (Betula papyrifera) Marshall canopies, and potential long-term sapling recruitment under dierent browsing sce-narios. From 1994 to 1997, 76 % of unexclosed planted T. occidentalis seedlings had been browsed at least once, compared with 0 % of exclosed seedlings. Increased browsing intensity and decreased light availability increased T. occidentalis mortality rates. Simu-lation models and vegetation surveys demonstrated that the best recruitment rates occurred for seedlings planted under Betula canopy and subjected to low browsing severity, but no recruitment occurred under high browsing pressure under either canopy type. The current level of browsing in these forests has the potential to alter the future composition of canopy tree species throug...|$|R

60|$|The {{behavior}} of the <b>deer</b> in the <b>yard</b> had puzzled Upton not a little. He could evolve no theory to account for it. Why at this season of the year should those two does have appeared so terror stricken at his approach, and why should the buck have been in such an ugly mood? From all accounts he had read, and from what Pat had said, he had had good grounds for expecting the animals to be fairly tame. He put the matter up to Pat as they tramped homeward, but his reply was evasive and unsatisfactory. In fact, the big fellow was not inclined to talk. He appeared to have something on his mind, and strode along with a black scowl darkening his usually good-humored face.
