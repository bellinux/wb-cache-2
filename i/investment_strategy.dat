25|$|Corporate {{transactional}} events generally {{fit into}} three categories: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and special situations. Distressed securities include such events as restructurings, recapitalizations, and bankruptcies. A distressed securities <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> involves {{investing in the}} bonds or loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress, when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value. Hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices. Hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt, as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks. While event-driven investing in general tends to thrive during a bull market, distressed investing works best during a bear market.|$|E

We investigate whether the characteristics, <b>investment</b> <b>strategies,</b> and performance of mutual funds held by these diverse tax clienteles differ. Examining both mutual fund distributions and mutual fund holdings, we find that funds held primarily by taxable investors choose <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> that result in lower tax burdens than funds held primarily in tax-qualified accounts. Despite these differences, we find no evidence that any investment constraints that may arise from these tax-efficient <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> result in performance differences between funds held by different tax clienteles...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} sources of {{technological}} growth of the multinational corporation. We conceptualize and shed empirical light on whether foreign <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> based on advanced greenfield subsidiaries, acquired subsidiaries, {{or a combination of}} both increase the likelihood of entry into technologies that represent new additions to the MNC’s technology portfolio. Repeated events analyses of the complete U.

To the extent MNC managers seek to enhance technological and strategic renewal through the expansion of foreign operations, the findings suggest that foreign <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> that involve the use of acquisitions are and should be the preferred alternative...|$|R
25|$|Value {{investing}} {{has proven}} to be a successful <b>investment</b> <b>strategy.</b> There are several ways to evaluate its success. One way is to examine the performance of simple value strategies, such as buying low PE ratio stocks, low price-to-cash-flow ratio stocks, or low price-to-book ratio stocks. Numerous academics have published studies investigating the effects of buying value stocks. These studies have consistently found that value stocks outperform growth stocks and the market as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Hedge fund {{strategies}} are generally classified among four major categories: global macro, directional, event-driven, and relative value (arbitrage). Strategies within these categories each entail characteristic risk and return profiles. A fund may employ a single strategy or multiple strategies for flexibility, risk management or diversification. The hedge fund's prospectus, {{also known as}} an offering memorandum, offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund, including the fund's <b>investment</b> <b>strategy,</b> investment type, and leverage limit.|$|E
25|$|Outside of academia, the {{controversy}} surrounding market timing is primarily focused on day trading conducted by individual investors and the mutual fund trading scandals perpetrated by institutional investors in 2003. Media coverage of these issues has been so prevalent that many investors now dismiss market timing as a credible <b>investment</b> <b>strategy.</b> Unexposed insider trading, accounting fraud, embezzlement and pump and dump strategies are factors that hamper an efficient, rational, fair and transparent investing, because they may create fictitious company's financial statements and data, leading to inconsistent stock prices.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{relative}} performance of different <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> for {{different structures of}} the payout phase. In particular, it looks at whether the specific glide-path of life-cycle <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> {{and the introduction of}} dynamic features in the design of default <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> affect significantly retirement income outcomes. The analysis concludes that there is no “one-size-fits-all” default investment option. Life-cycle and dynamic <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> deliver comparable replacement rates adjusted by risk. However, life-cycle strategies that maintain a constant exposure to equities during most of the accumulation period, switching swiftly to bonds in the last decade before retirement, seem to produce better results and are easier to explain. Dynamic management strategies can provide somewhat higher replacement rates for a given level of risk than the more deterministic strategies, at least in the case of pay-outs in the form of variable withdrawals. The length of the contribution period also affects the ranking of the different <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> with life-cycle strategies having a stronger positive impact the shorter is the contribution period. ...|$|R
40|$|We analyse the {{performance}} of simple <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> in IPOs based on a large sample of IPOs in Germany between 1985 and 2002. In particular, we compare {{the performance}} of the following strategies: Invest equally weighted in each IPO, invest market value weighted in each IPO, invest in an equally weighted portfolio of recent IPOs or invest in a value weighted portfolio of recent IPOs. We find that investors pursuing the first two <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> would realise significantly negative abnormal returns on average. In contrast, applying a bootstrapping procedure, we find that investing according to the latter two <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> does not yield significant underperformance. The difference in performance among <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> points to the phenomenon that firms going public in hot IPO markets perform worse than those going public in cold markets. We analyse to what extent this phenomenon can be attributed to pseudo market timing. Based on simulations, our results indicate that pseudo market timing can partly explain {{the performance of}} IPO <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> between 1996 and 2002. [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Collective {{intelligence}} underpins the efficient-market {{hypothesis of}} Eugene Fama– although the term collective intelligence {{is not used}} explicitly in his paper. Fama cites research conducted by Michael Jensen in which 89 out of 115 selected funds underperformed relative to the index {{during the period from}} 1955 to 1964. But after removing the loading charge (up-front fee) only 72 underperformed while after removing brokerage costs only 58 underperformed. On the basis of such evidence index funds became popular investment vehicles using the collective intelligence of the market, rather than the judgement of professional fund managers, as an <b>investment</b> <b>strategy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Event-driven {{strategies}} concern {{situations in}} which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event. An event-driven <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> finds investment opportunities in corporate transactional events such as consolidations, acquisitions, recapitalizations, bankruptcies, and liquidations. Managers employing such a strategy capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events, and take a position based on the predicted movement of the security or securities in question. Large institutional investors such as hedge funds {{are more likely to}} pursue event-driven investing strategies than traditional equity investors because they have the expertise and resources to analyze corporate transactional events for investment opportunities.|$|E

25|$|Hedge funds using {{a global}} macro {{investing}} strategy take sizable positions in share, bond or currency markets {{in anticipation of}} global macroeconomic events in order to generate a risk-adjusted return. Global macro fund managers use macroeconomic ("big picture") analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements. While global macro strategies have {{a large amount of}} flexibility (due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets), the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns. Global macro is often categorized as a directional <b>investment</b> <b>strategy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kenneth C. Griffin {{was born}} in 1968 in Daytona Beach, Florida. In high school, he excelled academically while also being the {{president}} of his math club. In 1986, Griffin started to invest during his freshman year at Harvard University after reading a Forbes magazine article. During his second year at Harvard, he started a hedge fund focused on convertible bond arbitrage. The fund was capitalized with $265,000 from friends and family, including money from his grandmother. He installed a satellite link to his dorm to acquire real-time market data. The <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> helped preserve capital during {{the stock market crash}} of 1987. Griffin's early success enabled him to launch a second fund, and between the two funds he was managing just over $1million. Griffin graduated from Harvard in 1989 with a degree in economics.|$|E
25|$|In September 2009 {{criticism}} {{over the}} seven-figure salaries earned by various coaches at Arizona's public universities (including ASU) prompted the Arizona Board of Regents to re-evaluate the salary and benefit policy for athletic staff. With the 2011 {{expansion of the}} Pac-12 Conference, a new $3billion contract for revenue sharing among all the schools in the conference was established. With the infusion of funds, the salary issue and various athletic department budgeting issues at ASU were addressed. The Pac-12's new media contract with ESPN allowed ASU to hire a new coach in 2012. A new salary and bonus package (maximum bonus of $2.05million) was instituted {{and is one of}} the most lucrative in the conference. ASU also plans to expand its athletic facilities with a public-private <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> to create an amateur sports district that can accommodate the Pan American Games and operate as an Olympic Training Center.

40|$|Contrary {{to mature}} IT {{innovations}}, fashionable IT innovations are hyped but lack institutionalization. Since an appropriate evaluation of these innovations is rather complex, companies often choose fixed <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> that neglect effects of organizational learning through continuous innovating. Hence, we develop a dynamic optimization model that determines the optimal budget allocation to mature and fashionable IT innovations by considering organizational learning. Furthermore, we evaluate various <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> both from an ex ante and an ex post perspective. Thereby, {{we focus on}} a company’s innovativeness and draw conclusions about the superiority of different <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> regarding expected NPV and its volatility...|$|R
25|$|On 21 November 2007, the Regional Development Minister {{announced}} that the <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> being considered by the NI Executive included the relaying of the Belfast-Londonderry line north of Coleraine, planned to include new signalling and a new crossing loop, allowing more trains. The total cost was £64million, and began in 2011, lasting five years. Prior to the major relaying of the Coleraine-Londonderry section, £12million was spent on improving the section between Ballymena and Coleraine. This saw the stretch between Ballymena and Coleraine closed completely for four months, with a replacement bus service. Trains continued to run between Londonderry, Coleraine and Portrush, with a small fleet stabled at Coleraine – four trains were stabled instead of the three previously reported. Once the project was completed in 2016, there is a further proposal to add two trains per day, enabling journey times between Belfast and Londonderry to be reduced by up to 30 minutes. As part of this plan, Translink envisages an hourly service to Londonderry, half-hourly to Ballymena. There have been proposals to improve the Belfast-Dublin line between Knockmore and Lurgan, enabling journey times to be reduced and frequency increased. This will improve NIR's services and allow an hourly Enterprise service to Dublin.|$|E
