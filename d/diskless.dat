25|$|This edition {{targeted}} the enterprise {{segment of the}} market and was sold through volume licensing to companies which have a Software Assurance contract with Microsoft. Additional features include support for Multilingual User Interface (MUI) packages, BitLocker Drive Encryption, and UNIX application support. Not available through retail or OEM channels, this edition is distributed through Microsoft Software Assurance (SA). As a result it includes several SA-only benefits, including a license allowing the operating of <b>diskless</b> nodes (<b>diskless</b> PCs) and activation via VLK.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, 1996, Oracle Corporation, {{along with}} 30 {{hardware}} and software vendors, announced an intent to build computers that are designed around the network computer platform. The idea was to design technology based on a profile that included <b>diskless</b> computers, commonly coded applications using languages such as Java, and interface with the Internet using common software such as Netscape Navigator. In May 1996, Apple became {{a partner in the}} network computing effort, and used the Apple Pippin platform as its implementation. Katz Media attempted to use the network computer platform concept as a way to push the Pippin into vertical markets. Although the Apple iMac (1998) is popularly known for the disappearance of the floppy disk, the Apple Pippin platform was about two years ahead of the iMac in this effort.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>diskless</b> node (or <b>diskless</b> {{workstation}}) is a workstation {{or personal}} computer without disk drives, which employs network booting to load its operating system from a server. (A computer {{may also be}} said {{to act as a}} <b>diskless</b> node, if its disks are unused and network booting is used.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Diskless</b> nodes (or {{computers}} {{acting as}} such) are sometimes known as network computers or hybrid clients. Hybrid client may either just mean <b>diskless</b> node, {{or it may}} be used in a more particular sense to mean a <b>diskless</b> node which runs some, but not all, applications remotely, as in the thin client computing architecture.|$|E
50|$|Both {{thin client}} and <b>diskless</b> node {{architectures}} employ <b>diskless</b> clients which have advantages over fat clients (see above), but differ {{with regard to}} the location of processing.|$|E
50|$|Better {{multimedia}} performance. <b>Diskless</b> nodes have {{advantages over}} thin clients in multimedia-rich applications {{that would be}} bandwidth intensive if fully served. For example, <b>diskless</b> nodes are well suited for video gaming.|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{deploying}} the <b>Diskless</b> Platform, Ultraspeed {{was struggling}} with poor storage utilization and the environmental and financial costs associated with these issues. In 2007 Ultraspeed used BlueArc's Titan 2000 'storage area network'(SAN) to produce a <b>diskless</b> Web Hosting platform. This technology means that Ultraspeed is able to change a server over in around 15 minutes.|$|E

5000|$|The bootserver handled {{boot and}} dump {{requests}} from the <b>diskless</b> workstations. It {{was a simple}} process that talked directly to the Ethernet driver.

50|$|Although {{this initial}} NC {{standard}} {{was intended to}} promote the <b>diskless</b> workstation model of computing, it did not preclude computers with additional features, {{such as the ability}} to operate either as a <b>diskless</b> workstation or a conventional fat client. Thus, an ordinary personal computer (PC) having all the required features, could technically be classified as a Network Computer; indeed, Sun noted that contemporary PCs did indeed meet the NC reference requirements.|$|E
