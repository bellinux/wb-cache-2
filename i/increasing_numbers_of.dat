5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the <b>increasing</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> {{destitute}} poor.

Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E

Although long thinking religious belief to be backward, Castro softened his approach to religious institutions and religious people were permitted {{for the first time to}} join the Communist Party. Although he viewed the Roman Catholic Church as a reactionary, pro-capitalist institution, Castro organized a visit to Cuba by Pope John Paul II for January 1998; it strengthened the position of both the Cuban Church and Castro's government.|$|E

40|$|Sansiviera is a {{plant that}} hardly needs water, or very little water. This {{occurrence}} is in accordance to its nature as succulent plant capable of preserving water in its leaf tissues. This research aims to know the effect of various farmyard manures and liquid fertilizer concentrations to sansiviera seedling growth. The research was conducted in experimental fields of UMM’s Faculty of Agriculture in Tegalgondo, with altitude of 560 meters from high sea level, starting from April and ended in July 2007. Factorial randomized block design was employed in this research with two factors, each of which consisted of 3 levels, thus delivering 9 combined treatments, added with 1 control treatment with three replications. The observation started within two weeks after planting with interval of 10 days. The following parameter to be observed were the length of longest leaf, length <b>of</b> average leaf, <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> width leaf, <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sprouting. The treatment of various farmyard manures and liquid fertilizer concentrations {{to the length of}} longest leaf resulted in significant difference. On 5 th observation, no significant difference occurred due to combined treatments for length of average leaf. The combined treatments resulted in no significant difference for <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> width leaf. While the the <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> average leaf gave no significant difference with combined treatments. The parameter of leaf increase showed no significant difference. However, on 6 th observation revealed that treatment of chicken farmyard manure + soil + hull with proportion of 1 : 1 : 1 combined with concentration of 9 ml/l water resulted in highest score to variable <b>of</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> leaf. Parameter <b>of</b> sprouting <b>number</b> resulted in no significant difference among the combined treatments. The conclusion thus can be drawn that the combined treatments gave no interaction to variables of average leaf length, <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> width, and <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sprout. Whereas for variable <b>of</b> the <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> longest leaf on 5 th observation resulted in significant difference with goat and chicken farmyard manures, respectively. For leaf increase on 6 th observation the treatments resulted in highest score to variable <b>of</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> leaf...|$|R
