40|$|This paper {{tests for}} {{uncovered}} interest parity (UIP) at distant horizons for the US {{and its main}} trading partners, including both mature and emerging market economies, also exploring the existence of nonlinearities. At long and medium horizons, it finds support in favour of the standard, linear, specification of UIP for dollar rates vis- 0 -vis major <b>floating</b> <b>currencies,</b> but not vis- 0 -vis emerging market currencies. Moreover, the paper finds evidence that, not only yield differentials widen, but that US bond yields do react in anticipation of exchange rate movements, notably when these take place vis- 0 -vis major <b>floating</b> <b>currencies.</b> Last, the paper detects signs of nonlinearities in UIP at the mediumterm horizon for dollar rates vis- 0 -vis {{some of the major}} <b>floating</b> <b>currencies,</b> albeit surrounded by some uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{behavior}} of interest rates and exchange rates following a variety of shocks to the international monetary system. Our analysis suggests that real interest rates in the US and Europe will remain low relative to historical experience {{for an extended period}} but converge slowly toward normal levels. During this adjustment interval, the US absorbs a disproportionate share of world savings. After a substantial initial appreciation of <b>floating</b> <b>currencies</b> relative to the dollar, the dollar and other <b>floating</b> <b>currencies</b> remain constant relative to each other. An improvement in the investment climate in Europe during the adjustment period would generate an immediate depreciation of the euro relative to the dollar. In real terms, the dollar and the <b>floating</b> <b>currencies</b> will eventually have to depreciate relative to the managed currencies. But most of the adjustment in the US trade account will come as US absorption responds to increases in real interest rates. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{maintenance}} of large current account deficits via financial account surpluses became problematic as investors became more risk averse to emerging market exposure {{as a consequence}} of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the Russian bond default in August 1998. After crafting a fiscal adjustment program and pledging progress on structural reform, Brazil received a $41.5billion IMF-led international support program in November 1998. In January 1999, the Brazilian Central Bank announced that the real would no longer be pegged to the US dollar. This devaluation helped moderate the downturn in economic growth in 1999 that investors had expressed concerns about over the summer of 1998. Brazil's debt-to-GDP ratio of 48% for 1999 beat the IMF target and helped reassure investors that Brazil will maintain tight fiscal and monetary policy even with a <b>floating</b> <b>currency.</b>|$|E

In practical terms, any non-euro EU member state can become an ERM-II member whenever they want, as this mechanism does not define any criteria to comply with. Economists however consider it to be more desirable for [...] "unstable countries", to maintain their flexibility of having a <b>floating</b> <b>currency,</b> rather than getting an inflexible and partly fixed currency as an ERM-II member.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that adjustment must occur to ultimately remove the imbalances {{from the international}} monetary system.

With this system as a background, we examine the behavior of interest rates and exchange rates following a variety of shocks to the international monetary system. Our analysis suggests that real interest rates in the US and Europe will remain low relative to historical cyclical experience for an extended period but converge slowly toward normal levels. During this adjustment interval, the US will continue to absorb a disproportionate share of world savings.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{attempts}} to analyse whether forward exchange arbitrage in currencies of managed rate regimes behave differently from <b>currencies</b> of free <b>floating</b> {{regimes in the}} forward exchange market. For this purpose, currencies of Great Britain, the European Union, and Japan are used as proxy <b>currencies</b> for free <b>floating</b> <b>currencies.</b> Proxy currencies for managed rate currencies are the Sri Lankan Rupee, the Indian Rupee, the Russian Rouble and the Brazilian Real. The US dollar is used as the anchor currency for both sets of currencies. The core of the paper revolves around the pricing difference between the fundamental forward price and the market forward price. Fundamental forward price {{is calculated based on}} the interest rate differentials of the two currencies; this is in concurrence with the interest rate parity condition. Market price is based on the forward pips and the spot rate. This analysis concentrates on the persistence of mispricing availability, the availability of forward pricing differences and the predictability of the mispricing in both sets of currencies. Finally, we also test whether the current forward price can predict the future spot price based on the interest rate parity theory. We present evidence that almost all the currencies have forward rate mispricing. However, we also present evidence to prove that mispricing in free <b>floating</b> <b>currencies</b> is extremely small, while managed rate currencies offer significant mispricing that could be exploited for arbitrage purposes. We also present evidence to establish that persistence of mispricing is specific to the currency pair and cannot be clearly attributed to the exchange rate regime. This paper also finds that {{it is not possible to}} statistically forecast the mispricing in both free floating and managed rate currencies. Further, failure of interest rate parity theory to accurately forecast the future spot rate is also documented...|$|R

We argue that a continuation of their current exchange rate regimes is likely to represent an optimal strategy for these countries {{in the run-up to}} both EU membership and the eventual adoption of the euro. ...|$|R
