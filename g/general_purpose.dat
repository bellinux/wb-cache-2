5|$|Dan Albone {{constructed}} the first commercially successful gasoline-powered <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> tractor in 1901, and the 1923 International Harvester Farmall tractor marked a major {{point in the}} replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters (combines), planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture. These inventions allowed farming tasks {{to be done with}} a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.|$|E
5|$|Nagumo quickly {{reversed}} {{his order}} to re-arm the bombers with <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> bombs {{and demanded that}} the scout plane ascertain {{the composition of the}} American force.

The other carrier was not sighted.|$|E
5|$|By June, {{the mayor}} was looking for {{political}} support to avert a full public inquiry. The National Party, whose members were dominant on the Council, and MLC Melinda Pavey had been particularly critical {{of the actions of}} the Department of Local Government in the <b>General</b> <b>Purpose</b> Standing Committee. Local independent MP, Rob Oakeshott said, however, that the Council should instead address the findings of the report, and stop arguing about the facts or using emotional arguments in support of it. He also cautioned against getting politicians involved, stressing that this was a formal legal process.|$|E

5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, GPGPU {{programs}} used the normal graphics APIs for executing programs. However, several new programming languages and platforms {{have been built}} to do <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> computation on GPUs with both Nvidia and AMD releasing programming environments with CUDA and Stream SDK respectively. Other GPU programming languages include BrookGPU, PeakStream, and RapidMind. Nvidia has also released specific products for computation in their Tesla series. The technology consortium Khronos Group has released the OpenCL specification, which is a framework for writing programs that execute across platforms consisting of CPUs and GPUs. AMD, Apple, Intel, Nvidia and others are supporting OpenCL.|$|E
5|$|The ENIAC (1946) was {{the first}} machine that was both {{electronic}} and <b>general</b> <b>purpose.</b> It was Turing complete, with conditional branching, and programmable to solve {{a wide range of}} problems, but its program was held in the state of switches in patchcords, not in memory, and it could take several days to reprogram. Researchers such as Turing and Zuse investigated the idea of using the computer's memory to hold the program as well as the data it was working on, and it was mathematician John von Neumann who wrote a widely distributed paper describing that computer architecture, still used in almost all computers.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, {{with the}} passage of the Statute of Westminster, Canada and other Dominions became fully {{sovereign}} from the United Kingdom. This had the effect of elevating the Canadian coat of arms, which had been granted as deputed arms for particular uses in a colony, to the status of the royal arms of the King in right of the country, for general purposes throughout the country. They thus replaced the British coat of arms, which had previously been arms of <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> throughout the British Empire, in court rooms and on government buildings to represent the ruling monarch. This change can be seen in the Great Seal of Canada of George VI, where the royal arms of Canada replaced the British arms, and is even more evident in the Great Seal of Canada for Elizabeth II, where the title has been redefined as Queen of Canada. These are the coat of arms of the Queen of Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{forces were}} {{under the command of}} General António Augusto dos Santos, a man with strong faith in new {{counter-insurgency}} theories. Augusto dos Santos supported a collaboration with Rhodesia to create African Scout units and other special forces teams, with Rhodesian forces even conducting their own independent operations during the conflict. Due to Portuguese policy of retaining up-to-date equipment for the metropole while shipping obsolete equipment to the colonies, the Portuguese soldiers fighting in the opening stages of the conflict were equipped with World War II radios and the old Mauser rifle. As the fighting progressed, the need for more modern equipment was rapidly recognised, and the Heckler & Koch G3 and FN FAL rifles were adopted as the standard battlefield weapon, along with the AR-10 for paratroopers. The MG42 and, then in 1968, the HK21 were the Portuguese <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> machine guns, with 60, 81 and 120mm mortars, howitzers and the AML-60, Panhard EBR, Fox and Chaimite armoured cars frequently deployed for fire support.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{planning assumption}} for the Royal Navy was for thirteen Global Combat Ships (eight ASW and five GP), replacing the Type 23 frigate fleet like-for-like. However, {{it was later}} announced during the November 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review by Prime Minister David Cameron that only the eight anti-submarine warfare Type 26 frigates would be ordered. The funding for the remaining five <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> Type 26 frigates is instead {{to be spent on}} developing a new class of lighter and more affordable <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> frigates (GPFF). Due to an expected lower cost, the government suggested it may allow an eventual increase in the total number of frigates in the Royal Navy. This <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> frigate will be designated as the Type 31 frigate. In July 2016, BAE revealed two <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> frigate designs to meet the requirement; the Avenger-class and the Cutlass-class.|$|E
