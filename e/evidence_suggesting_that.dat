In the appeal hearing on 22 September, McLaren alleged that they had twice been advised by race director Charlie Whiting that Hamilton had correctly returned the position to Räikkönen.

5|$|The {{memorial}} {{is located}} {{in front of the}} main entrance to Government House, {{one of the most prominent}} buildings in Adelaide, on the corner of North Terrace and King William Street. It was constructed with a budget of £2500 raised through public donations, and was designed by the London-based sculptor Adrian Jones. While the statue itself was not intended to represent any particular soldier, there is <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> the head of the rider was based on that of George Henry Goodall.|$|E

The switch failure should have triggered an alarm, but it too appears to have failed. Forty-one minutes later, an estimated 300tonnes of petrol would have spilled {{down the side of}} the tank through the roof vents onto the ground inside a bund walla semi-enclosed compound surrounding several tanks.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{documentary}} {{evidence about the}} nature of trade in Æthelberht's Kent. It is known that the kings of Kent had established royal control of trade by the late seventh century, but it is not known how early this control began. There is archaeological <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> the royal influence predates any of the written sources. It has been suggested that one of Æthelberht's achievements was to take control of trade away from the aristocracy and to make it a royal monopoly. The continental trade provided Kent access to luxury goods which gave it an advantage in trading with the other Anglo-Saxon nations, and the revenue from trade was important in itself.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle {{was thought}} to have been founded {{during the second half of}} the 14th century, as the first {{accurate}} historical accounts of the castle date back to the mid-14th century, when most of the territories of western Rus' were under control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A written document by Prince Yuriy Koriatovych in 1374, for example, mentions that the Magdeburg rights would be presented to Kamianets inside the castle. Archaeological excavations during the 1960s, however, provided contrasting <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> the castle might date back even earlier to the end of the 12th or the beginning of the 13th centuries. It is also clear from historical and archaeological evidence that an earthen fortress existed in the area during the time of the East Slavic state of Kievan Rus', but not on the same site as the current castle.|$|E

5|$|Unknown biotoxins, pathogens, and the {{impairment}} of feather waterproofing {{can lead to}} hypothermia and avian cholera. Since this grebe usually winters on the coast, it is also vulnerable to oil pollution. Large-scaled deaths (such as 150,000 birds on the Salton Sea in 1992) from erysipelas, avian cholera and avian botulism have been recorded {{in the past and}} could threaten the species. These and other factors, such as human disturbance, including collisions with power transmission lines, contribute to declining populations in certain areas. This species used to be threatened in North America by the millinery industry, which helped facilitate the hunting of the birds, and egg collectors. Although this is true, this grebe is hunted in the Gilan Province in Iran, for both commercial and recreational purposes. However, there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> these threats could result in a significant risk for the overall population.|$|E
5|$|While {{many sources}} {{recommend}} additional intravenous agents to reduce {{damage to the}} kidney, most of the evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent and conflicting. Mannitol acts by osmosis to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies {{and there is a}} risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of bicarbonate to the intravenous fluids may alleviate acidosis (high acid level of the blood) and make the urine more alkaline to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> bicarbonate has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues. If urine alkalinization is used, the pH of the urine is kept at 6.5 or above. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is often used to ensure sufficient urine production, but evidence that this prevents kidney failure is lacking.|$|E
5|$|In {{the reign}} of Akhenaten (c. 1353–1336 BC) in the mid-New Kingdom, a single solar deity, the Aten, became the sole focus of the state religion. Akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased gods' names and images on monuments, {{targeting}} Amun in particular. This new religious system, sometimes called Atenism, differed dramatically from the polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods. Whereas, in earlier times, newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs, Atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional multiplicity of perspectives. Yet Atenism {{may not have been}} full monotheism, which totally excludes belief in other deities. There is <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> the general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private. The picture is further complicated by Atenism's apparent tolerance for some other deities, like Shu. For these reasons, the Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat suggested that Akhenaten may have been monolatrous, worshipping a single deity while acknowledging the existence of others. In any case, Atenism's aberrant theology did not take root among the Egyptian populace, and Akhenaten's successors returned to traditional beliefs.|$|E

5|$|Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson was one {{of several}} sons of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of Mann and the Isles (died 1237), and thus a member of the Crovan dynasty. Although Óláfr is known to have had two wives, and no {{contemporaneous}} source names the mother of his children, there is <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> their mother may have been Óláfr's second wife: Cairistíona, daughter of Fearchar mac an tSagairt, Earl of Ross (died c.1251). Specifically, the Chronicle of Mann states that, when Óláfr died in 1237, he was succeeded by his fourteen-year-old son, Haraldr Óláfsson (died 1248). This source therefore dates Haraldr Óláfsson's birth to 1223, about the time when Óláfr and Fearchar allied themselves in marriage. The ancestral origins of Fearchar's family are unknown, although he {{appears to have been a}} native of eastern Ross. The Norse-Gaelic Crovan dynasty, founded by Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's paternal great-great grandfather, held royal power in the Isles from the late eleventh to the mid thirteenth century. Consisting of a region roughly encompassing the Hebrides and Mann, the Isles are named in Old Norse sources as Suðreyjar ("Southern Isles"), and in Gaelic sources as Innsi Gall ("Islands of the Foreigners"). Various documentary sources, in the form of contemporary chronicles and sagas, reveal that during the dynasty's tenure of power, the kings of the Isles tended to acknowledge the authority of the kings of Norway.|$|E
