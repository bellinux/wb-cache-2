5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} interviewees were too old to thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them <b>Dark</b> <b>Days</b> by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added {{that he wanted to}} know more about the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} album, titled <b>Dark</b> <b>Days,</b> {{was released}} in the United States and Japan in July 2001, through Artistdirect and EMI, while it {{was released in}} Europe, through Locomotive Music, a year later. Rather than releasing the album under his own name, McKagan readopted the Loaded moniker. They announced three dates at the House of Blues taking place in Anaheim, California, Las Vegas, Nevada, and West Hollywood, California (where they were joined onstage by Slash) in November 2001, adding Mike Squires and Jeff Rouse, who replaced Dederer, to the lineup on lead and bass guitar, respectively, while Feveyear performed keyboards and percussion. Loaded played more shows in the US (where they were joined on stage by Billy Duffy and Matt Sorum during a show in Los Angeles) before going on to tour Japan. They toured Japan as part of Fire Wire, supporting J and Zilch, where McKagan first met guitarist Dave Kushner, who was, then, the Zilch guitarist.|$|E
5|$|The {{high winds}} knocked down trees and power lines across Long Island, New York, leaving roughly 170,000residents without electricity. Power crews from Pennsylvania {{were called in}} to assist in {{restoring}} electricity. Damage across the island reached $8million, of which $3million stemmed from erosion at Rockaway Beach. One person was killed in New York when a branch snapped off a tree due to high winds and fell on her. An estimated 36,000residents in the lower Hudson Valley lost power. President Ford later declared Nassau, Suffolk, and Rensselaer counties major disaster areas. Effects were similar in Connecticut where approximately 247,000people lost electricity. Commuter train service along Conrail's New York–New Haven line was canceled due to power outages. A portion of the Merritt Parkway was closed due to downed trees. High winds in Bridgeport toppled many trees and power lines, shattered windows, and sparked two house fires. Five boats in the city's harbor sustained damage. Flooding in and around Danbury prompted evacuations of an apartment complex and motel. One fatality took place in Barkhamsted due to slippery roads. Overall damage in Connecticut was far less than expected, according to state police, with losses reaching $7.1million and mostly stemming from Fairfield and New Haven counties. Power companies brought in additional personnel to expedite the restoration process, though many remained in the <b>dark</b> <b>days</b> after the storm. A couple and their two dogs in Vernon died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator on August14.|$|E

25|$|The England {{team had}} finally removed {{one of the}} openers, but his partner {{remained}} steadfast in his concentration, and was now joined by a determined looking David Boon. Boon, who {{for much of the}} <b>dark</b> <b>days</b> of mid-1980s Australian cricket had remained the rock in the top order, had yet to score a century so far in the series, and looked set to try to right that wrong. He and Taylor breezed the Australian total past 350, Taylor bringing up his 150 in the process.|$|E
25|$|Bache {{demonstrated}} {{that it would}} remain a major presence on Wall Street in the Crash of 1929 by reducing the credit extended to the firm's customers and warning them {{of the possibility of}} a reversal. Fortuitously, the firm had none of its own capital invested in the stock market and had no investment trusts to protect during the markets decline. In the <b>dark</b> <b>days</b> of the Bank Holiday in 1933, when cash was virtually unavailable, Bache attracted national attention by supplying currency to customers in New York, Detroit, and other cities.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} Hick was {{averaging}} 53 in first-class cricket, but the 13 innings he played {{after his return}} in late July produced only 246 runs, leaving him with a season's average of just 33.50, his worst showing since the <b>dark</b> <b>days</b> of 1991. 2004, however, saw him return to form with a vengeance, his 1,589 first-class runs (at 63.56) his best aggregate since 1990 and the lowest of his four centuries being 158, and he was picked for the FICA World XI team in three one-day games against New Zealand in January 2005, these matches having List A but not ODI status.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish empire {{had still}} not {{returned}} to first-rate power status, {{but it had}} recovered and even extended its territories considerably from the <b>dark</b> <b>days</b> {{at the beginning of}} the 18th century when it was, and particularly in continental matters, at the mercy of other powers' political deals. The relatively more peaceful century under the new monarchy had allowed it to rebuild and start the long process of modernizing its institutions and economy. The demographic decline of the 17th century had been reversed. It was a middle-ranking power with great power pretensions that could not be ignored. But time was to be against it.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to books which present largely independent characters, certain stories feature {{men and women}} who are regularly partnered on adventures—often with an underlying romantic element. The Jaz Parks series, by Jennifer Rardin, follows the titular CIA operative and her vampire boss as they combat supernatural threats to national security. Jocelynn Drake's <b>Dark</b> <b>Days</b> novels follow a vampire named Mira and a vampire hunter named Danaus, who work together to protect their people from a mutual enemy. Night Huntress, a series by Jeaniene Frost, centers on a half-vampire named Catherine and a vampire bounty hunter called Bones, who gradually become lovers while battling the undead.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{recognizing}} how {{crony capitalism}} weakened the economy due to collusion {{between government and}} big business and adhering to the Catholic social principle of subsidiarity, President Aquino {{set out on a}} course of market liberalization agenda {{while at the same time}} emphasizing solidarity, people empowerment and civic engagement to help alleviate poverty in the country. The Aquino administration also sought to bring back fiscal discipline in order as it aimed to trim down the government's budget deficit that ballooned during Marcos' term through privatization of bad government assets and deregulation of many vital industries. As president, Aquino sought out to dismantle the cartels, monopolies and oligopolies of important industries that were set up by Marcos cronies during the <b>dark</b> <b>days</b> of Martial Law, particularly in the sugar and coconut industries. By discarding these monopolies and allowing market-led prices and competition, small farmers and producers were given a fair chance to sell their produce and products at a more reasonable, competitive and profitable price. This, in a way, also helped a lot in improving the lot of farmers who are in dire need of increasing their personal income and earnings. It was also during Aquino's time that vital economic laws such as the Built-Operate-Transfer Law, Foreign Investments Act and the Consumer Protection and Welfare Act were enacted.|$|E
