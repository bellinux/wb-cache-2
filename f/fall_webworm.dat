50|$|Invasive gypsy moths {{may also}} serve as an {{important}} food source for black-billed cuckoos. Most birds cannot consume gypsy moth caterpillars because of their hair-like setae however, cuckoos can consume them because {{of their ability to}} shed their abdominal lining. During outbreak years of these insects, the abundance of black-billed cuckoos increased on Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes. This increase is not due to higher reproductive rate because then the black-billed cuckoo populations would only increase the next year. The abundance is higher because the cuckoos flock towards the outbreak areas. This is supported by the fact that cuckoo abundance is actually lower than average in the areas surrounding the outbreaks, suggesting a large influx of the birds towards outbreaks. They are able to find these areas due to post-migratory nomadic behavior. Once reaching their breeding ground, they search vast expanses of forest for the most suitable breeding area, in this case, where there is an abundance of food. Similar patterns have also been observed during outbreaks of tent caterpillars, <b>fall</b> <b>webworms</b> and cicadas.|$|R
25|$|V. maculifrons is a {{polyphagous}} species, {{meaning that they}} feed {{on a variety of}} foods. The number of trips a worker makes to forage depends on the age of the worker, as well as the size of the nest, since more food is necessary to feed a larger nest. Workers dedicated to foraging are capable of olfactory learning, allowing them to distinguish odors specific to food. Workers use this ability to scavenge for dead insects such as earwigs and <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> larvae, as well as live arthropods. They are also frugivores, obtaining carbohydrates from fruits, nectar, and honeydew. Workers go to flowers in an attempt to catch insects, but often end up feeding on nectar and pollinating the flower while doing so. They feed on honeydew, which is a sweet, sticky liquid. However, honeydew is susceptible to fermentation, causing individuals that feed on it to become inebriated and unable to fly or walk. Since this species is attracted to sugar sources, they may be attracted to soft drinks or other foods consumed by humans. Adults feed larvae with a chewed paste made from other insects and carrion.|$|E

50|$|The <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> {{feeds on}} just about any type of {{deciduous}} tree, where leaves are chewed; branches or the entire tree may become defoliated. Worldwide, it has been recorded from 636 species and {{is considered to be}} among the most polyphagous of insects. In the eastern U.S., pecan, walnut, American elm, hickory, fruit trees, and some maples are preferred hosts; in some areas persimmon and sweetgum are also readily eaten.

50|$|Shelters collectively {{built by}} {{caterpillars}} {{play an important}} role in antipredator defense. The tough silk shell of the nest formed by a colony of E. socialis caterpillars is virtually impregnable to both birds and invertebrate predators. Like many other shelter builders, the resident caterpillars venture from the nest only under the cover of darkness when birds and predatory wasps are inactive. Bound-leaf shelters, and the more loosely spun shelters of the tent caterpillars and the <b>fall</b> <b>webworm,</b> Hyphantria cunea, cannot exclude predators completely but all are likely to be deterred to some degree, providing the residents with greater protection than they would enjoy resting in the open.|$|E
50|$|John Douglas Tothill was {{the first}} federal {{forestry}} official appointed in New Brunswick. He studied at the Ontario Agricultural College, specialising in entomology and botany, and in 1922 received a doctorate from Harvard University. He was employed {{for a short period}} by the US Bureau of Entomology Gypsy Moth Parasite laboratory. Tothill later joined the Entomology Branch of the Departmentof Agriculture and established a laboratory on the University of New Brunswick campus in Fredericton.Over the next decade he led research on invasive insects, such as the brown-tail moth Euproctis chrysorrhoea, the gypsy mothLymantria dispar, and native insects such as the forest tent caterpillar Malacosoma disstria, the <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> Hyphantria cunea, and the spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana.|$|E
50|$|The eastern tent {{caterpillar}} (Malacosoma americanum) is {{a species of}} moth in the family Lasiocampidae, the {{tent caterpillar}}s or lappet moths. It is univoltine, producing one generation per year. It is a tent caterpillar, a social species that forms communal nests in the branches of trees. It is sometimes confused with the gypsy moth and the <b>fall</b> <b>webworm,</b> and may be erroneously {{referred to as a}} bagworm, which is the common name applied to unrelated caterpillars in the family Psychidae. The moths oviposit almost exclusively on trees in the plant family Rosaceae, particularly cherry (Prunus) and apple (Malus). The caterpillars are hairy with areas of blue, white, black and orange. The blue and white colors are structural colors created by the selective filtering of light by microtubules that arise on the cuticle.|$|E
50|$|The {{caterpillars}} {{are highly}} variable in coloration, {{ranging from a}} pale yellow to dark grey, with yellow spots and long and short bristles. There are two cream stripes along the sides. The two races - one {{more common in the}} north, the other in the south - differ in head capsule coloration. The maximum length is 35 mm. Webs are progressively enlarged and much messier looking than those of tent caterpillars (which occur only in spring and have shorter hairs and very little yellow on their bodies); also, webs from the <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> are concentrated to the tips of the branches, whereas the tent caterpillar webs are largely found in the unions. Larvae feed inside the tents until the late instars. Very young larvae feed only on the upper surfaces of leaves; later, they consume whole leaves. The larval stage lasts about four to six weeks.|$|E
50|$|Social {{caterpillars}} exhibit {{three basic}} foraging patterns. Patch-restricted foragers obtain {{all of the}} food required during the social phase of their larval development from the leaves found in a single contiguous patch or from several such closely spaced patches. The foraging arena is typically well defined by a protective silk envelope or by leaves bound together. On large trees, patches usually consist of the leaves found {{on a part of}} a branch, an entire branch, or on several closely situated branches. But on small trees and herbaceous plants the entire host may eventually be enveloped. Although there have been no surveys to determine the proportion of social caterpillars that exhibit each of these foraging patterns, patch-restricted foraging is probably the most common and also the least complex. Well known examples of patch restricted foragers include the Euonymus caterpillar, Yponomeuta cagnagella and the ugly nest caterpillar, Archips cerasivoranus. The <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> Hyphantria cunea, is a patch restricted forager during the initial stages of its development.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Three {{hypotheses}} of insect-plant {{interactions were}} tested by rearing <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> larvae in the laborato-ry on foliage from red alder trees with different histories of western tent caterpillar herbivory. <b>Fall</b> <b>webworm</b> larvae raised on foliage from trees {{which had been}} attacked pre-viously for two summers by moderate densities of western tent caterpillars grew faster and attained heavier pupal weights than did those fed foliage from unattacked trees. This contradicts the hypothesis that moderate l vels of pre-vious herbivory induces the production of plant defensive chemicals in red alders. Growth of webworms, when fed foliage from unattacked trees adjacent o alders that were attacked by <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> larvae, {{was the same as}} when fed foliage from trees isolated by distance from attacked trees. This contradicts the hypothesis that attacked trees stimulate the production of defensive chemicals in neigh-boring trees. Young and mature alder foliage was equally good for <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> growth and survival, and foliage from trees heavily attacked by both <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> and west-ern tent caterpillars for three years produced slow growth rates and small pupal sizes. This supports the hypothesis that continued heavy insect attack can cause the deteriora-tion of the food quality of attacked trees...|$|E

The expression {{levels of the}} exogenous insect resistance genes in the transgenic lines were determined by Q-PCR and Western blot. Leaves of the transgenic lines were used for insect feeding bioassays on first instar larvae of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) and <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> (Hyphantria cunea). At 5 d of feeding, the mean mortalities of larvae feeding on Cry 1 Ac + SCK and Cry 1 Ah 3 transgenic poplars leaves were 97 % and 91 %, while mortality on Cry 9 Aa 3 transgenic lines was about 49 %. All gypsy moth and <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> larvae were killed in 7 - 9 days after feeding on leaves from Cry 1 Ac + SCK or Cry 1 Ah 3 transgenic poplars, while all the <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> larvae were killed in 11 days and about 80 % of gypsy moth larvae were dead in 14 days after feeding on those from Cry 9 Aa 3 transgenic lines.

40|$|Background/Question/Methods Understanding {{the impact}} of {{invasive}} species on native ecosystems is important both ecologically and economically. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate potential outcomes of novel interactions of native insect herbivores with invasive plants. We investigated interactions of the specialist honeysuckle sawfly (Zaraea inflata) with native (Lonicera reticulata and Symphoricarpos albus) and invasive (Lonicera maackii and Lonicera japonica) honeysuckle species. We also examined the interactions of the generalist <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> (Hyphantria cunea) with native (L. reticulata, Viburnum. prunifolium, Ulmus americana, and Prunus serotina) and invasive (L. maackii, L. japonica, Lonicera tatarica, Pyrus calleryana, and Elaeagnus umbellata) plant species. Adult Z. inflata sawflies and H. cuneamoths were captured and reared in a laboratory to observe oviposition rates and preferences on native and invasive species. Next, no-choice bioassays were conducted with Z. inflata larvae and H. cunea caterpillars to determine how well they utilize various native and invasive plant species. Lastly, choice bioassays were conducted to determine host preference of Z. inflata larvae and H. cuneacaterpillars. Results/Conclusions The honeysuckle sawfly adults strongly preferred to oviposit on native honeysuckle species compared to invasive honeysuckle. However, larvae of this insect had similar survival and performance on L. reticulata, S. albus, and L. maackii. The larvae performed the worst on L. japonica. When the larvae were given a choice between native and invasive plant leaves, the larvae strongly preferred the native species. <b>Fall</b> <b>webworm</b> adults oviposited equally on native and invasive plants. Larvae of this insect displayed some variation in performance on native and invasive honeysuckle species. When given a choice between native and invasive plants, however, they preferred native plants. Overall, both the honeysuckle sawfly and the <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> generally prefer familiar native plants over novel invasive plants even, in some instances, when they can perform equally well on the invasive plants. Understanding factors that influence host choices of adults and larvae could benefit efforts at using native insects as biocontrol agents...|$|E

40|$|Leaf {{defoliators}} eat {{the leaves}} of trees and other plants, sometimes {{the leaves of}} en-tire trees. Defoliating insects usually do not kill trees by their feeding, but trees may lose their vigor and grow more slowly when attacked by many insects or when defoliated several years in a row. Several types of leaf defoliators strike black walnut. The most common one is the walnut caterpillar, which occurs throughout the eastern United States. Walnut caterpillars are often found in masses on the trunk or feeding on the leaves (fig. 1). One colony can quickly defoliate an entire young tree. A very young caterpillar is red and covered with grayish white hairs. A full-grown caterpillar is as long as 2 inches and has a black body with yellow stripes along each side. The entire body is covered with long white hairs. <b>Fall</b> <b>Webworm</b> The <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> is another common and conspicuous defoliator of walnut and other trees throughout the eatern United States.

40|$|Patterns of Effectiveness of Bacillus thuringiensis Preparations against Insect Pests. I. Relation {{between the}} Insect Mortality and the Amount of Bacillus Toxin or Active Ingredient Accepted in Insect Body. K. NOMURA, K. KASAMATSU and R. CHIBA. Faculty of Horticulture, Chiba University, Matsudo, Japan. Tech. Bull. Fac. Hort. Chiba Univ., No. 21 : 45 - 49, 1973. Effects {{of various kinds}} of Bacillus thuringiensis {{preparations}} against lepidopterous larvae were tested in 1971 - 73, and some data were obtained concerning the insecticidal factors of the pesticides. In many cases the larval mortality was determined chiefly by {{the total amount of}} Bacillus toxin or active ingredient accepted in larval body. Relative values of the amount can be estimated by the following formula: (a) thickness of spraying liquid × (b) intake of treated leaves. The value given by the formula mentioned above, AIB, is considered as an indicator for estimation of the effectiveness, excepting in the low concentration range. On the other hand, in some species, e. g. <b>fall</b> <b>webworm,</b> Hyphantria cunea and diamondback moth, Plutella maculipennis, negative correlations were observed between (a) and (b) in general, perhaps due to the repellency of the pesticides. Thus the concentration-mortality curves may be considered to be non-sigmoid types in such species as <b>fall</b> <b>webworm</b> and diamondback moth, although some other species, e. g. silkworm, Bombix mori and Spodoptera litura, show typical sigmoid curves. In bioassay and practical use of Bacillus preparations, such differences of mortality pattern ought to be considered. バチルス剤(BT剤) の効果を論ずる上で, バチルス毒素の昆虫体内への取入れ量が 1 つの重要要因になるであろうことは, BT剤の作用性から見て当然予想されるところである. 筆者らはこの点を検討し, かつそれの意義を明らかにするため, 数種の鱗翅目幼虫について実験を行なった. 体内取入れ毒量は, 便宜的には 2 ̆ 2 処理濃度比×摂食量 2 ̆ 2 によってあらわすことができる(これを相対値で示すことにし, その値をAIBと呼ぶ). コナガやアメリカシロヒトリなどの幼虫では, 多くの場合そのAIB値に応じた死亡率を示し, 上記の推論が妥当であることが示唆された. ところで, これらの昆虫では, 処理濃度が高まるにつれて顕著に摂食量が減じ, 高濃度処理において必ずしもAIB値が高まるとは限らない. したがって, ある濃度範囲内(有効範囲内) にあっては, 濃度にあまり関係なくほぼ一定の死亡率を示す傾向がある. ただし, その範囲を下回った低濃度では, AIB値にかかわりなく急激に効果低下が見られる. このような関係から, 上記の昆虫群では普通一般に見られる濃度(薬量) -死亡率曲線とは異なった死亡パターンを示す. しかし, 諸氏の成績から考察すると, ハスモンヨトウなどにあっては, その濃度(薬量) -死亡率曲線はむしろ普通のS字曲線型に近いと思われ, 昆虫の種類による相異がうかがわれる. このような死亡パターンの相異は, 今後生物検定のみならず, 実用の場面においても考慮すべきであろう...|$|E
