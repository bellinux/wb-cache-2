40|$|Location {{management}} {{is a key}} issue in personal communication service (PCS) networks. Performance analysis plays important roles {{in the implementation of}} location management methods and system design in PCS networks. Existing PCS networks have the <b>home</b> <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (HLRs) and visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (VLRs) architecture for location management. Some interesting dynamic location management methods are proposed to improve the system performance of PCS networks. However, the existing performance analysis of the dynamic location management methods are too simple and not available for PCS networks with real HLR/VLR architecture. One of the reasons is the complexity and difficulty of the problem. In this paper, we challenge the problem and successfully establish a new analytical model available for the analysis of the important dynamic movement-based location management method for PCS networks...|$|R
40|$|GSM and IS- 41 are two {{mobility}} management standards {{widely used}} in second generation networks. These two standards lean on a centralized architecture made up of <b>home</b> <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (HLRs) and visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (VLRs). From these standards, the location update and search procedures always imply interrogation of the HLR, even if the two mobile terminals that want to communicate {{are in the same}} location area. Given the limited bandwidth of the radio operator channel and the new time sensitive applications of third-generation systems, such an approach of mobility management is not convenient for the next generation mobile networks. This paper proposes a method for reducing the processing load and the signalization traffic generated by update and search location procedures compared to IS- 41 standard. Taking into account the specific characteristics of the traffic in the mobile networks, it introduces a semi-dynamic approach based on a hybrid architecture using forwarding pointers without the load related to the dynamic models. Numerical results show that such a method significantly improves the efficiency of location procedures...|$|R

40|$|The {{mobility}} {{feature of}} mobile stations (MSs) imposes a large burden on network traffic control {{as a result}} of location management. Design issues of location management include MS registration (updating) and call set-up (paging). Previous approaches introduced several network topologies for updating and paging procedures, but most of them focused on a single problem: either updating optimiza-tion or paging optimization. In this paper, we design and integrate two mechanisms, distributed temporary location caches (TLCs) and distributed <b>home</b> <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (HLRs), to reduce database access delay and to decrease network signaling traffic in both updating and paging for low power, low tier micro cellular systems. By using TLCs, our approach can improve the performance of updating and paging in comparison with previous approaches. Experimental results based on our analytic model show that our location management procedures have lower HLR access rate, lower registration cost, and lower call set-up cost than other approaches. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Location {{management}} {{is a key}} issue in personal communication service networks to guarantee the mobile terminals to continuously receive services when moving {{from one place to}} another. In this paper, we study two location management schemes, a dynamic movement-based scheme (DYNAMIC- 3 G) and a static scheme (STATIC- 3 G), for 3 G cellular networks where <b>home</b> <b>location</b> <b>registers,</b> gateway <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (GLRs), and visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> form a three-level hierarchical mobility database structure. For both schemes, the cost functions are formulated analytically. We prove that there is an optimal movement threshold that minimizes the total cost function of DYNAMIC- 3 G and propose a binary search algorithm to find the optimal threshold. Furthermore, we present performance evaluation and comparison of the proposed schemes with the previous schemes in 2 G cellular networks where the GLR is not present. Our studies validate the optimality of the DYNAMIC- 3 G scheme and show that the proposed schemes outperform the previous schemes, especially when the remote-local-cost ratio is high. The comparison results between DYNAMIC- 3 G and STATIC- 3 G indicate that DYNAMIC- 3 G should be adopted when the mobility rate is low, and STATIC- 3 G should be adopted otherwise. Furthermore, DYNAMIC- 3 G tends to perform better than STATIC- 3 G when the paging cost is high or the number of cells in a location area is large.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new hashing and caching {{strategy}} (NHC) {{in order to}} reduce the overall location management cost in wireless mobile networks. It uses caches whose up-to-date information is responsible for dropping this cost and these caches are updated not only at call arrival time from the calling Mobile Terminals (MTs) but also at call receiving time to those MTs, and even at location registration time. To achieve load balancing among replicated <b>Home</b> <b>Location</b> <b>Registers</b> (HLRs), hashing technique is used and this load is also affected by the up-to-date cache information. The analytical modeling and numerical results show that our proposed method more frequently prepares the caches with up-to-date information with the increase of average call arrival rate, average call receiving rate, and even with MT’s increased mobility rate. This increases the probability of finding called MT’s location as well as hit ratio in the caches. As a result, the overall location management cost including load on a particular location server (HLR) are minimized considerably than all other previous approaches.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two mobile {{location management}} algorithms for ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks {{based on the}} PNNI (private network-to-network interface) standard. The first solution is called the mobile PNNI scheme because it builds on the PNNI routing protocol. It uses limitedscope (characterized by a parameter S) reachability updates, forwarding pointers, and a route optimization procedure. The second solution is called the LR (<b>location</b> <b>registers)</b> scheme because it introduces <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (such as the cellular <b>home</b> and visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers)</b> into the PNNI standards-based hierarchical networks. This scheme uses a hierarchical arrangement of <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> with the hierarchy limited to a certain level S. Analytical models are set up to compare the average move, search, and total costs per move of these two schemes for different values of the CMR (call-to-mobility ratio), and to provide guidelines for selecting parameters of the algorithms. Results show that at low CMR's (CMR ! 0. 025), the LR scheme performs better than the mobile PNNI scheme. We also observe that the two schemes show a contrasting behavior {{in terms of the}} value to be used for the parameter S to achieve the least average total cost. At low CMR's, the parameter S should be high for the mobile PNNI scheme, but low for the LR scheme, and vice versa for high CMR's. Index Terms [...] -Mobility management, PNNI, wireless ATM. I...|$|R
