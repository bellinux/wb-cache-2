50|$|In Greater Cairo, the once-extensive Cairo urban {{system is}} now all but defunct. The <b>express</b> <b>tramway</b> system to {{and within the}} suburb of Masr el-Djedida, or Heliopolis, is still in operation. It {{is an example of}} a {{surviving}} interurban electric railway, the ancestor of today's Light Rail. Additionally, the small 1970s system in the satellite town of Helwan, situated 25 km to the south, is operational. Some of Cario's cars are ex-Toronto Transit Commission President's Conference Car Streamliners.|$|E

50|$|Bardill's Island {{roundabout}} {{provides a}} junction with Toton Lane (B6003), which connects to both Stapleford and the Toton Lane Park & Ride site that {{is linked to}} central Nottingham by the Nottingham <b>Express</b> Transit (NET) <b>tramway.</b> The roundabout is also near the George Spencer Academy and the garden centre after which it is named. The A52 then passes through Bramcote at the roundabout with the A6007 next to Bramcote leisure centre and becomes a three-lane dual carriageway, however the left lane is a bus lane. There is a right-turn at traffic lights for Wollaton Road (B6006) for Beeston near the Nurseryman pub.|$|R
25|$|The steam tram {{achieved}} {{only limited}} success and cut just 10 {{minutes from the}} 1-hour 10-minute horse-drawn journey from Basford to Nottingham. The report of 1885 in The Railway & <b>Tramway</b> <b>Express</b> reported that the steam tram gave unsatisfactory performance and had more holidays allotted to it than the horses. With running costs of around 6d per mile, each return trip from Basford to Nottingham would have cost the company around 2s 9d. In 1889, it lost its licence and was withdrawn, the 1885 passenger tram car being rebuilt into a horse-drawn, four-wheeled vehicle, being shortened and having its top cover removed. This car {{spent the rest of}} its days on the Trent Bridge service.|$|R
50|$|A new {{roundabout}} gives {{access to}} the Clifton South Park & Ride site that is linked to central Nottingham by the Nottingham <b>Express</b> Transit (NET) <b>tramway.</b> The road then meets Nottingham Road from Gotham (the former main road to Kegworth, the B679) at a roundabout, with the Crusader (former Hungry Horse and before that, Hardys & Hansons pub) on the left. It passes {{the site of the}} now demolished (March 2012) Man of Trent on the right. It passes Clifton police station on the right, then the Clifton campus of Nottingham Trent University on the left, as Clifton Lane. The road here became a dual carriageway in the early 1970s when the Clifton Bridge was dualled, with an exit for the B679 (the former route), for West Bridgford, and meets the A52 at an interchange. The interchange was built when the bridge was dualled in 1972. It crosses the Trent concurrently with the A52, then exits to the east as Queens Drive where it is no longer a trunk road. This section of road opened as the B679 when the first Clifton Bridge was opened in May 1958. It later became the A6019 (now a shorter road next to the railway station), and took a course slightly to the east. The road was dualled in the late 1970s.|$|R
