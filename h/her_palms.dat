Eminem joins Rihanna {{in front of the}} burning house for the final verse. Meanwhile, after the flashback, the woman comes home and locks herself in the {{bathroom}} to stop her abusive lover from entering. In another scene, the fire on <b>her</b> <b>palms</b> vanishes as she clasps her hands. Flames later engulf Eminem and the couple, who are then shown fighting in front of the burning house.

25|$|Sometime {{after her}} {{recovery}} from cancer, Scully began to regularly attend Mass again. At {{the request of}} Father McCue, Scully got involved in a case concerning a paraplegic girl who {{was found dead in}} a kneeling position with <b>her</b> <b>palms</b> outstretched and eye sockets charred. After Scully discovered the girl was part of a set of quadruplets and two more were murdered, Father McCue shared with her the story of the seraphim and the nephilim, which Scully interpreted as a possible explanation for the deformations and deaths of the girls. Scully continued to have visions of Emily, and when the last girl died, Scully believed she was returning the girl to God. Upon her return to Washington D.C., she went to confession to gain peace of mind and acceptance for Emily's death. In confession she regretted her decision of letting the girl go. This suggests Scully had doubts about her faith.|$|E
25|$|She and her troupe {{departed}} from Le Havre for America on 15 October 1880, arriving in New York on 27 October. On 8 November, she performed Scribe's Adrienne Lecouvreur at Booth's Theater {{before an audience}} which had paid a top price of $40 for a ticket, an enormous sum at the time. Few in the audience understood French, {{but it was not}} necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received a thunderous ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood perfectly still, with her hands clasped under her chin, or with <b>her</b> <b>palms</b> on her cheeks, and then suddenly stretched them out to the audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theater-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.|$|E

500|$|P.N.03 is a science-fiction third-person shooter. In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Vanessa Z. Schneider, a freelance mercenary {{who works on}} colonized planets. She is contracted by a mysterious client to destroy Computerized Armament Management System (CAMS) robots that have gone berserk. Robots of this type had {{been responsible for the}} deaths of Vanessa's parents. To combat the CAMS, Vanessa wears [...] "Aegis suits", powered exoskeletons that allow her to fire energy beams from <b>her</b> <b>palms</b> and to perform powerful attacks called [...] "energy drives". Energy drives, which deplete the energy meter, grant temporary invulnerability to Vanessa and damage multiple enemies. At checkpoints, the player uses points earned from defeated robots to purchase Aegis suits, suit upgrades and energy drives. The player may play [...] "trial missions" [...] (randomly generated levels) between missions to score extra points.|$|E
500|$|It is Day 15, October 6, 2004, and Claire {{wakes up}} from nightmares two {{nights in a}} row, screaming. In the first, Claire wakes to find herself no longer pregnant, as she walks into the forest and {{encounters}} John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) at a table, playing cards. She asks him why he is there, but Locke interrupts, telling her [...] "He was your responsibility, but you gave him away, Claire. Everyone pays the price now." [...] Locke looks up with one white and one black eye. She hears crying and finds a baby crib. After unfolding several layers of material she dips her hands into {{a pool of blood}} and then wakes screaming; she has injured her hands by digging her nails deeply into <b>her</b> <b>palms.</b> In the second dream, someone holds Claire down and injects something into her stomach, though she has no wound.|$|E
500|$|... is {{a genetic}} ability to {{manipulate}} the user's own skeletal structure by using chakra infusions {{to manipulate the}} growth and properties of their bones for combat use. The user thus recovers heavy injuries quickly and is not hindered at all if their bones are broken; in fact, the technique's usage encourages the user to break up their bones, which are hardened almost like steel, for offensive use. Most of this jutsu's techniques are named after plants, combined with a theme around [...] "dances", including the , , and [...] The technique's progenitor, Kaguya ÅŒtsutsuki, uses an advanced variation called the : she manifests bones from her back and then fires bones from <b>her</b> <b>palms</b> at the intended target. When these bones hit a living organism, the target starts to deteriorate at a molecular level, reducing their bodies to {{nothing more than a}} pile of ash. She also used this attack in a variety of ways: as a projectile attack, incorporating the use of her dimension-manifesting abilities to land a two-sided attack as well as a close-range melee attack. [...] Shikotsumyaku was a kekkei genkai of the Kaguya Clan, who became extinct due to the clan's barbaric and bloodthristy nature. Kabuto Yakushi used the DNA from a construct of the clan's last member, Kimimaro, to gain the technique.|$|E

2500|$|Juri's {{shirt was}} modeled after a spider, {{and left the}} sides of her breasts exposed at Ono's suggestion. Her pants were {{designed}} to give a [...] "silhouette that looks like a taekwondo uniform." [...] The black trim on her pants was added to set her apart from other Street Fighter characters who wear similar uniforms. Her colour scheme was originally plain. However, when lined up with other characters, she didn't stand out; as a result, they employed hot pink, a colour not used in any other female character in the game. They added black details to her outfit to make it less [...] "frivolous." [...] A pink crystal, known as the Feng Shui Engine, was added as a replacement inside her left eye after deciding to align her with Seth, in order to more closely tie her character to the organization. The crystal was originally in her stomach, similar to Seth. Other ideas were considered, including having it in one of <b>her</b> <b>palms,</b> one of her legs, or one of her ankles. They eventually settled on putting it in her eye, with design director Kamei commenting that a [...] "big globe in the stomach of a female character wasn't going to look very attractive." [...] He also commented that an eye is a logical place to have an artificial replacement, as well as already being spherical. Initially, Juri was designed to be chubbier and cuter. Gradually the design was made slimmer, though the team noted at some point they had realized they had overdone it and reversed the changes slightly. She was given full legs, and a slender upper body in order to show the contrast. Kamei wanted to make her even more slender, but decided that if she was too small, her kicks would lack impact. Several designs were considered for her face, going through about seven versions before settling on her current appearance, though time constraints played a part in the decision.|$|E
