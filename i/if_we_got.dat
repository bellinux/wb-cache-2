500|$|The {{game against}} Detroit was {{a battle for}} first place, but the {{suspension}} unsettled the Canadiens. Goaltender Jacques Plante later recalled that the game seemed secondary, and players and officials were [...] "casting worried glances at the sullen crowd". Likewise, Dick Irvin said later, [...] "The people didn't care <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> licked 100–1 that night." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Causing a Commotion" [...] was {{recorded}} and mixed by Bray along with Shep Pettibone who also did additional production on the track. Junior Vasquez was the mixing engineer along with Steve Peck; the former also did the audio editing. Background vocals {{were provided by}} Donna De Lory and Niki Haris. [...] "Causing a Commotion" [...] has a dancey, up-tempo groove in it. The musical arrangement consists {{of a number of}} hooks interpolating with each other. It begins with the chorus, where Madonna sings the line [...] "I've got the moves baby, You've got the motion, <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> together we be causing a commotion." [...] The verses are accompanied by a four-note descending bassline and interjecting staccato chords.|$|E
500|$|In August, Republicans {{began to}} argue that a vote for Paul would equate to a vote for Dukakis. Later in the month, Republicans grew weary of Dan Quayle as the party's vice presidential nominee. Paul commented that [...] "we like Dan Quayle. We also like George Bush and Mike Dukakis. They {{have been the best}} recruiters we have." [...] He {{explained}} that the Libertarian Party was receiving around 100 calls a day from people interested in the party because [...] "a large number of Americans are disenchanted with the choice they have." [...] Paul held a rally in Salt Lake City that drew 200 supporters, and proclaimed that he [...] "wouldn't be surprised <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> 20% of the vote in Utah." ...|$|E

500|$|The second track [...] "Causing a Commotion" [...] has a danceable, up-tempo groove. The musical {{arrangement}} {{consists of}} a number of hooks interpolating with each other. It begins with the chorus, where Madonna sings the line [...] "I've got the moves baby, You've got the motions, <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> together we be causing a commotion." [...] The verses are accompanied by a four-note descending bassline and interjecting staccato chords. The lyrics make reference to Madonna's 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and have three parts to the vocal harmony. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Walt Disney Music Company, the song is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 192 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major with Madonna's voice spanning from the high-note of C3 to B5. The song has a basic sequence of B–Fm7–B–F9–B6 as its chord progression.|$|E
500|$|In early 1998, the Red Hot Chili Peppers fired guitarist Dave Navarro {{and were}} on the verge of {{breaking}} up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way I could imagine carrying on [...] is <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> John back in the band." [...] With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. When Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] With Frusciante back on guitar, the Chili Peppers began recording their next album, Californication, released in 1999. Frusciante's return restored a key component of the Chili Peppers' sound, as well as a healthy morale. He brought with him his deep devotion to music, which affected the band's recording style during the album. Frusciante has frequently stated that his work on Californication was his favorite.|$|E
500|$|After the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically {{and formed}} Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who {{questioned}} her inclusion. She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it for the fun... it was just something we wanted to do, so <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves." [...] Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, [...] "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E

500|$|Bardon has {{revealed}} that both he and Brown were sceptical about their characters marrying. In an interview with American fan-based newspaper, Walford Gazette, he commented, [...] "No way did the pair {{of us want to}} get married because we thought <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> married, we'd sit indoors and watch the telly every night. As it happened, we've had some nice things to do. And we are married, and it's worked out all right." [...] Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage might be a good thing. On-screen, Dot had suffered the death of her grandson Ashley, and Brown felt that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot would have got over Ashley's death [...] "would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [...] with marrying Jim she gets a family– that's what persuaded me. That house will become a house again– it will have a central point, {{they will be able to}} use the house as a central point, as Dot will be there." ...|$|E
500|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the race, the Serbian team filed a protest claiming that Čavić touched the wall first but did not use enough force to trigger the timing sensor. Officials of the International Swimming Federation (FINA) watched the video in slow motion, and announced that Phelps' victory would be upheld. Ben Ekumbo, a FINA referee announced that [...] "It's very clear that the Serbian swimmer touched second after Michael Phelps." [...] Although Serbia conceded their protest, not everyone was convinced that Phelps had won the gold medal; Branislav Jevtić, Serbia's deputy chef de mission for all sports, was quoted as saying [...] "in my opinion, it's not right, but we must follow the rules. Everybody saw what happened." [...] In one interview following the race, Čavić said [...] "I am completely happy with where I am", while in another he revealed that he expects that [...] "people will be bringing this up for years and saying you (Čavić) won that race. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to do this again, I would win it". While the result is still controversial, a high speed photograph shows Phelps touching the wall, while Čavić is still a short distance away. In April 2015, Spitz said that he had been sent an email posted by Omega which stated that Phelps had lost the 100m butterfly final.|$|E

2500|$|By end of 1954 Elvis asked D.J. Fontana, {{who was the}} underutilized drummer for the Louisiana Hayride, [...] "Would you go with us <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> {{any more}} dates?" [...] Presley was now using drums, as did many other rockabilly performers; drums were then {{uncommon}} in country music. In the 1955 sessions shortly after Presley's move from Sun Records to RCA, Presley was backed by a band that included Moore, Black, Fontana, and pianist Floyd Cramer. In 1956 Elvis acquired vocal backup via the Jordanaires.|$|E
2500|$|In {{revising}} Ivory's {{draft of}} the script, Guadagnino took out {{a considerable amount of}} nudity. He described Ivory's version as [...] "a much more costly [...] different film" [...] which could not have been made because of [...] "market realities." [...] In 2016, Ivory stepped down from directing to avoid conflicts, leaving Guadagnino to direct the film alone. [...] "It would be awkward," [...] Ivory said, [...] "to have two directors working together. It might take longer, it would look terrible <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> in fights on the set, and so on." [...] Ivory subsequently sold the rights to the screenplay to Guadagnino's company.|$|E
2500|$|Without the {{availability}} of antibiotics at the time, medical personnel {{found that it was}} beneficial to get the flu victims out of crowded hospitals, where many of them would die, and into tents where they would get a lot more fresh air. [...] According to Draper, [...] "if we could bed [...] down in tents which were furnished by the National Guard, more of them lived. [...] <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> them into bed {{in the early stages of}} the disease the chances of living were far better. [...] If they stayed around for two or three days, and finally went to bed, because they couldn't do anything else—they would very likely die." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{there is}} a view that while {{it is likely that}} the Germans were expecting an attack somewhere on the French shoreline, {{evidence}} of expectation of an attack at Dieppe in particular, at that particular time, is less conclusive. [...] Proponents of this view point out that elements of the Canadian forces, such as at Green beach, landed without trouble. [...] Lt Col Merrit has been quoted as saying 'How could the Germans have known <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> in on our beach against defences which were unmanned?' [...] No 4 Commando's troops also reported that they achieved surprise against the gun batteries they were tasked with destroying. [...] Under this view, the statements by German POWs that the raid was fully expected are explained as being propaganda.|$|E
2500|$|The {{end of the}} war and {{emancipation}} brought both jubilation and anxiety, many {{not knowing}} how to restructure their lives. At emancipation some slaveowners reacted by evicting all former slaves from their properties, others negotiated work contracts or sharecropping arrangements. Since few of these agreements were legally contracted, and the newly freed slaves had little access to the legal system, they were often victimized. Former Kanawha County slave Lizzie Grant explained- [...] "Slavery had not ended, no we just went from slaves to peons...They did free them in one sense of the word, but put them in a whole lot worse shape as they turned them loose to make their own way with nothing to make it with...e mostly had to stay with our [...] <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> anything...e were forced to stay on as servants, yes, if we expected to live...hey still made us do just like they wanted to after the war." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flea {{also had}} plans to record a solo album. He asked Chili Peppers manager Lindy Goetz to help him promote the record and his future solo career. Flea {{eventually}} abandoned the idea in favor of offering his bass services to other artists. He performed on over forty records from 1995 to 1998, ranging from Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill to former Minutemen bassist Mike Watt's debut solo album Ball-Hog or Tugboat?. He also worked with Tori Amos and Michael Stipe on a track for the soundtrack to the 1995 Johnny Depp film Don Juan DeMarco. Navarro was fired from the Chili Peppers in 1998, and Flea questioned {{whether or not the}} Red Hot Chili Peppers would stay together: [...] "...the only way I could imagine carrying on is <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> John [...] back in the band." [...] Frusciante had completed drug rehabilitation in 1997 after a severe addiction to heroin and crack cocaine left him on the brink of death. Flea visited Frusciante in early 1998, inviting him back to the Chili Peppers; an emotional Frusciante readily accepted.|$|E

2500|$|Ford {{recalled}} to his {{son that}} Bill Holden, who had joined the Army Air Corps and he, [...] "talked about it and we were both convinced that our careers, which were just getting established, would likely be forgotten {{by the time we}} got back ... <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back." [...] He was assigned in March 1943 to active duty at the Marine Corps Base in San Diego. With his Coast Guard service, he was offered a position as an officer, but Ford declined, feeling it would be interpreted as preferential treatment for a movie star and instead entered the Marines as a private. He trained at the Marine base in San Diego, where Tyrone Power, the number-one male movie star at the time, was also based. Power suggested Ford join him in the Marine's weekly radio show, Halls of Montezuma broadcast Sunday evenings from San Diego. [...] Ford excelled in his training, winning the Rifle Marksman Badge and named [...] "Honor Man" [...] of the platoon and promoted to sergeant by the time he finished.|$|E
2500|$|Dodge {{approached}} Jacques Gershkovitch, a Russian immigrant in Portland guest {{conducting the}} Portland Symphony (which {{would later become}} the Oregon Symphony), about the orchestra after seeing him conduct. Though Gershkovitch first explained {{that he did not}} teach children, Dodge insisted that he come listen to the youth ensemble she had assembled. One orchestra member recalled: [...] "I well remember the excitement of that night when Gershkovitch climbed the stairs to Mary Dodge's attic, where we had assembled to play for him. He listened as we played our hearts out. He applauded us and said that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the missing instruments, he would take us on." [...] In an attempt to hand over the baton to Gershkovitch, he simply stated [...] "I take." [...] Initially, Dodge remained as associate director of the orchestra; she also assisted with sectionals, appointed a board of directors, and designated the ensemble as the Portland Junior Symphony Orchestra in 1924. The original board of directors established the mission of the orchestra: [...] "to encourage appreciation and rendition of orchestral music by young people, to give public symphonic and popular concerts, to discover and develop latent talent among the children of Portland." [...] Six years later, Dodge resigned while the orchestra was financially sound. She continued to teach and became increasingly dedicated to a scientific approach to bowing. Dodge died in 1954.|$|E
2500|$|After Navarro's {{departure}} {{in early}} 1998, Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were on the}} verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way I could imagine carrying on [...] is <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> John back in the band." [...] Kiedis was surprised and thought there was no way Frusciante would ever want to work with him as the two still had unresolved personal problems from when Frusciante quit in 1992. With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. In April 1998, when Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] Flea decided to contact Anthony and have him meet with John to try and resolve any personal problems that the two might have had. Flea was relieved to find out that both had no bad blood towards each other and were once again excited to make music together. Within the week and, for the first time in six years, the reunited foursome jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony Kiedis said of the situation: [...] "For me, that was the defining moment of what would become the next six years of our lives together. That was when I knew that this was the real deal, that the magic was about to happen again. Suddenly we could all hear, we could all listen, and instead of being caught up in our finite little balls of bullshit, we could all become players in that great universal orchestra again." ...|$|E
