High-resolution and real-time AFM phase imaging enables us to observe the detailed growth process of lamellae. During the early stage of crystallization, embryos appear and disappear on the film surface. <b>A</b> stable embryo <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> single lamella, which <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> founding lamella. Then, the founding lamella <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> lamellar sheaf through branching and splaying.

5|$|On September 4, a {{cold front}} exited {{the coast of}} Texas into the Gulf of Mexico. A {{convective}} band from the front continued southeastward and stalled between Veracruz, Mexico and Tampa, Florida. The band began to split into two on September 6; the northeastern portion <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> frontal wave and tracked northeastward, while the southwestern portion remained nearly stationary and began showing signs of tropical organization. Located {{in an area of}} generally low pressures, the system developed a spiral band structure, though deep convection was mostly intermittent. Subsequent to the formation of a surface circulation, the system <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression while located about 450miles (725km) northwest of Mérida, Yucatán.|$|E

50|$|In {{flowering}} plants, {{the female}} gametophyte (sometimes {{referred to as}} the embryo sac) has been reduced to just eight cells inside the ovule. The gametophyte cell closest to the micropyle opening of the ovule <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> the egg cell. Upon pollination, a pollen tube delivers sperm into the gametophyte and one sperm nucleus fuses with the egg nucleus. The resulting zygote <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> embryo inside the ovule. The ovule in turn <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> seed and in many cases the plant ovary <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fruit to facilitate the dispersal of the seeds. Upon germination, the embryo grows <b>into</b> <b>a</b> seedling.|$|R

5|$|A {{disturbance}} in the South Indian convergence zone near Seychelles persisted on October24 with {{an area of}} convection. It gradually organized while passing near Agaléga. On October27, it <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression, and after Dvorak classifications of 2.5, the system was named Arilisy. It became disorganized on October29, never having intensified beyond winds of 50km/h (30mph). After moving to the southwest for much of its duration, Arilisy dissipated on October30.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area moved to the west off the Burmese coast on July 5 and <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> depression {{the next day in}} the north central Bay of Bengal. The depression intensified as it moved to the northwest, becoming a deep depression on July 7. The system made landfall on the Orissa coast during the morning of July 8 and rapidly degenerated into a broad area of {{low pressure}} overland. The remnant low moved north over western Bihar and it persisted there until July 12 when it was absorbed by the monsoon trough.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed in the Bay of Bengal passed over the southern Indian subcontinent and <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> depression in the Arabian Sea off the southern Maharashtra coast on October 11. The depression did not develop as it drifted west, and it degenerated into an area of {{low pressure}} as it was approaching the Arabian Peninsula. The depression brought widespread rains to southern Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar. Scattered heavy rain was also reported in the Laccadives.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} crossed Central America organized and <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression on June 27.
