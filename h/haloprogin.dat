50|$|<b>Haloprogin</b> is an {{antifungal}} drug used {{to treat}} athlete's foot and other fungal infections. It is marketed in creams under the trade names Halotex, Mycanden, Mycilan, and Polik.|$|E
50|$|<b>Haloprogin</b> was {{previously}} used in 1% topical creams as an antifungal agent. It was marketed over-the-counter primarily to treat tinea infections of the skin. The {{mechanism of action}} is unknown.|$|E
50|$|<b>Haloprogin</b> {{had a high}} {{incidence}} of side effects including: irritation, burning, vesiculation (blisters), scaling, and itching. It has since been discontinued due to the emergence of more modern antifungals with fewer side effects.|$|E
40|$|<b>Haloprogin</b> {{was shown}} to be a highly {{effective}} agent for the treatment of experimentally induced topical mycotic infections in guinea pigs. Its in vitro spectrum of activity also includes yeasts, yeastlike fungi (Candida species), and certain gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity of <b>haloprogin</b> against dermatophytes was equal to that observed with tolnaftate. The striking differences between the two agents were the marked antimonilial and selective antibacterial activities shown by <b>haloprogin,</b> contrasted with the negligible activities found with tolnaftate. Addition of serum decreased the in vitro antifungal activity of <b>haloprogin</b> {{to a greater extent than}} that of tolnaftate; however, diminished antifungal activity was not observed when <b>haloprogin</b> was applied topically to experimental dermatophytic infections. Based on its broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, <b>haloprogin</b> may prove to be a superior topical agent in the treatment of dermatophytic and monilial infections in man...|$|E
40|$|<b>Haloprogin</b> is {{a topical}} {{antifungal}} agent. Its structure {{does not contain}} any of the functional groups typically exploited in hydrogen bond based co-crystal design. On the other hand, its 1 -iodoalkyne moiety is nicely tailored to a crystal engineering strategy based on halogen bonding. Here we describe the formation of three polymorphs of <b>haloprogin</b> and of three co-crystals that this active pharmaceutical ingredient forms with both neutral and ionic co-crystal formers. The halogen bond {{plays a major role}} in all of the six structures and the interaction is thus confirmed to be a valuable tool which may complement the hydrogen bond when polymorphs and co-crystals of active pharmaceutical ingredients are pursued...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antifungal}} activity of ME 1401, a potential topical antifungal agent, was {{compared with that}} of <b>haloprogin,</b> clotrimazole, miconazole, tolnaftate, and ciclopirox olamine by using an agar dilution procedure. ME 1401 showed a broad antifungal spectrum and inhibited all of the 428 strains of 52 species of pathogenic yeasts and filamentous fungi tested at concentrations ranging from 0. 01 to 12. 5 micrograms/ml. In general, the activity of ME 1401 was comparable or superior to that of clotrimazole and was greater than that of <b>haloprogin</b> and the other reference drugs under the conditions used. Only tolnaftate was superior to ME 1401 in its activity against clinical isolates of Trichophyton rubrum. ME 1401 showed no cross-resistance with any of the reference drugs and exhibited potent fungicidal activity...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study was undertaken in rats, rabbits, miniature swine and man, {{in which the}} percutaneous absorption of the following compounds, labeled with 14 C or 35 S, were studied: <b>haloprogin,</b> N-acetylcysteine, cortisone, testosterone, caffeine and butter yellow. The amount of radioactivity excreted in urine for 5 days following application of the test compound to the skin was employed as the index for quantifying skin penetration. A special nonocclusive foam pad device for rabbits and miniature swine was developed to prevent artifacts resulting from transfer of drug to the urine by any route other than percutaneous absorption. The dose was 4 Î¼g/cm 2 of skin surface. The excretion data obtained from the topical studies were adjusted for recovery of radioactivity following intravenous administration of the radioactive drug. The results obtained in this study indicated that skin permeability decreases in the following order: rabbit, rat, pig and man. Overall, skin of miniature swine has the closest permeability characteristics to that of human skin with this series of compounds...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-five {{years ago}} {{many of the}} topical {{remedies}} for superficial mycoses were irritating, toxic, or allergenic. Total x-ray depilation of the scalp was the accepted mode of therapy for tinea capitis. The introduction of topical nystatin for candidiasis and tolnaftate for dermatophytosis were major advances, but tinea capitis, onychomycosis, and chronic tinea pedis still presented problems. Soon after its introduction in 1958, griseofulvin became the definitive form of therapy {{for all types of}} dermatophytosis and {{played a major role in}} abolishing large-scale epidemics of tinea capitis in some countries. Recently, <b>haloprogin</b> and the imidazole derivatives, miconazole and clotrimazole, which are topically active against dermatophytes and Candida albicans, have become available. Selective indicator media for isolating dermatophytes are useful diagnostic tools, but quicker methods of diagnosis which require little interpretation are still lacking. Epidemiologic studies in Vietnam again revealed the effects of climate and occlusion on the prevalence, incidence, and severity of superficial mycoses and led to renewed interest in host susceptibility, environment, and prevention of infections...|$|E
