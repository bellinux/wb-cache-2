After series of range finding test, the fishes were exposed to lethal concentrations 0. 00 mg/L, 0. 01 mg/L, 0. 02 mg/L, 0. 03 mg/L, 0. 04 mg/L and 0. 05 mg/L and as well as sub-lethal concentrations 0. 000 mg/L, 0. 002 mg/L, 0. 003 mg/L, 0. 004 mg/L, 0. 005 mg/L and 0. 006 mg/L of detergent effluent for 56 days in a renewal bioassay procedure. The median lethal concentration (LC 50) values for lethal and sublethal tests were 0. 0166 mg/L and 0. 0038 mg/L respectively. Respiratory disturbance, erratic swimming, loss of equilibrium, lethargies and sudden fish death were observed in the exposed fish and these varied greatly with differences in concentration of the toxicant and this shows that mortality increases {{with an increase in}} concentration. The differences observed in the mortalities of C. gariepinus at varying concentrations were significant (p < 0. 05), an indication that mortality could be a factor of concentration and time of exposure.

Methods: This systematic review has been performed by searching the databases including Science Direct, ProQuest, Google Scholar, and PubMed. A strategic search was performed with keywords including caustic, corrosive, ingestion, and children, and was limited to articles in English and Persian. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 2 and PASW Statistics 18. Results: We selected 64 articles regarding caustic ingestion with a total sample of 11, 345 cases. The data analysis indicated a higher consumption in young boys (age range 2. 78 (2. 02) years (OR= 0. 53 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 49 - 0. 57 (P= 0. 08)).

40|$|Acute {{inhalation}} injury {{can result}} {{from the use of}} <b>household</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> (e. g. chlorine, ammonia), industrial or combustion gases (e. g. sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides) or bioterrorism. The severity of the injury is to a great extent determined by the circumstances of exposure. If exposure was in a confined or badly ventilated room, the intoxication is generally more severe. Concentration rather than duration of exposure is the more important determinant for tissue injury. Two types of responses to acute inhalational exposure to irritant gases can be discerned, depending on the water solubility of the compound. More water-soluble toxic gases (e. g. ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide) affect {{the upper part of the}} respiratory tract. Following exposure to these gases, clinical symptoms appear instantly and consist of lacrimation, nasal discharge, bronchospasm, increased mucus production and cyanosis. Patients with chronic bronchitis or asthma are usually more susceptible. The less soluble gases (e. g. nitrogen dioxide) tend to produce effects in the peripheral airways and alveoli. Clinical symptoms can be absent during the first hours after exposure. Generally, bronchospasm is not a prominent symptom. Consequently, physical examination of the patient immediately after exposure may not provide information regarding the full extent of the clinical severity of intoxication...|$|E

It is therefore important to determine simple methods for limiting the spread of the virus within the home. The purpose of this work was to test a representative range of common <b>household</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> for their effectiveness at killing or reducing the viability of influenza A virus. Methodology/Principal Findings: Plaque assays provided a robust and reproducible method for determining virus viability after disinfection, while a National Standard influenza virus RT-PCR assay (VSOP 25, www. hpa-standardmethods. org. uk) was adapted to detect viral genome, and a British Standard (BS:EN 14476 : 2005) was modified to determine virus killing. Conclusions/Significance: Active ingredients in a number of the cleaning agents, wipes, and tissues tested were able to rapidly render influenza virus nonviable, as determined by plaque assay. Commercially available wipes with a claimed antiviral or antibacterial effect killed or reduced virus infectivity, while nonmicrobiocidal wipes and those containing only low concentrations (, 5 %) of surfactants showed lower anti-influenza activity.

40|$|Most {{commercial}} <b>household</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> {{and personal}} care products contain the anionic surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulphonates (LAS) as the active compound. After their use they are discharged, theoretically after adequate wastewater treatment, into receiving waters finally reaching estuaries and coastal waters. Laboratory toxicity tests are useful tools in determining at which concentration a certain wastewater compound becomes hazardous for an existing group of organisms. Early life-stage toxicity tests include exposure during the most sensitive development period of the organism. In fish, this type of assay has shown to predict accurately maximum acceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) values (comprised in the range defined by the NOEC and LOEC) in fish early life-stage tests. For this reason, larvae of the seabream, Sparus aurata, were exposed to increasing concentrations of LAS homologues (C 10 -C 14) and commercial LAS. Obtained LC 50 values ranged between 0. 1 and 3. 0 mg l- 1 and were compared with LC 50 values of previous hatching experiments with the same species. Larvae {{proved to be more}} sensitive to LAS exposure of individual homologues than eggs, except in the case of commercial LAS. LC 50 values can be directly employed to determine their potential risk in a concrete environment with known pollutant concentrations. Dividing the LC 50 value with the found homologue concentration and extrapolating with certain security factors proposed by different environmental organisms, potentially hazardous pollutant concentrations may be detected. Average estuarine or coastal LAS concentrations are generally below toxicity limits for this kind of organism, considering that the average alkyl chain length of commercial LAS is 11. 6 carbon atoms...|$|E
40|$|Background: The related tumour {{suppressor}} proteins Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) and neogenin {{are absent}} or weakly expressed in many cancers, whereas their insertion into cells suppresses oncogenic behaviour. Serine proteases influence the initiation and progression of cancers although the mechanisms are unknown. Methods: The effects of environmental (bacterial subtilisin) and endogenous mammalian (chymotrypsin) serine proteases were examined on protein expression in fresh, normal tissue and human neuroblastoma and mammary adenocarcinoma lines. Cell proliferation and migration assays (chemoattraction and wound closure) {{were used to}} examine cell function. Cells lacking DCC were transfected with an ectopic dcc plasmid. Results: Subtilisin and chymotrypsin selectively depleted DCC and neogenin from cells at nanomolar concentrations without affecting related proteins. Cells showed reduced adherence and increased migration, but after washing they re-attached within 24  h, with recovery of protein expression. These effects are induced by chymotryptic activity as they are prevented by chymostatin and the soybean Bowman-Birk inhibitor typical of many plant protease inhibitors.

40|$|Foam {{spraying}} {{is often}} used {{as an alternative to}} droplet spraying for the treatment of surfaces. It is generally assumed that aerosol exposure is considerably smaller for foam sprays compared to conventional droplet mists. This especially refers to the application of biocides in the occupational section, e. g. the disinfection in the food industry {{as well as in the}} consumer section, especially for cosmetics and <b>household</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> ("convenience products"). While there is a well-developed quantitative understanding on the physical and technical parameters determining the exposure risk when using droplet sprays, the characterization of potential aerosol exposure for the application of foams has received little attention so far. In this study the current state of knowledge on the use of foam sprays for biocide application was surveyed from the literature. In addition some exploratory aerosol measurements were carried out for typical biocide products to compare aerosol release from foam and droplet spraying. More than 55 biocidal substances, such as QAV or peracidic products as well as pyrethrins and courmarins comprising products for disinfection, insecticides and rodenticides, are used in foams. The foaming technologies can be classified as mechanical foam generation using low and high pressure and blowing agent foam generation. Since no information on aerosol formation during foam spraying was found in the literature, exploratory aerosol measurements were performed in a laboratory set-up. A reduction of a factor of three was determined for aerosol release in the three health-related size fractions (respirable, thoracic, inhalable), when the biocidal product was sprayed as a foam compared to droplet spraying. Generation of semi-solid, highly-viscous foams using physical blowing agents lowered aerosol formation more than hundred fold. The experiments show that aerosol exposure cannot generally be ruled out when using foams but increasing foam viscosity seems to reduce aerosol release. Thus, further investigations should specify to what extent foam could be explained by physical chemical data of biocidal products by using specific application techniques. These factor determine not only the primary aerosol inhalation exposure but also the risk for exposure and mobility of the environment. Correlations allowing for a prediction of aerosol release from process and product parameters have to be established in future more comprehensive experiments...|$|E
40|$|Plastics {{have become}} a {{universal}} material {{for use in a}} myriad of commercial and consumer products. One such product, exterior siding, is the focus of this project. Although siding products were originally made from wood, vinyl siding, which offered superior performance, was introduced in the 1950 ’s. More recently, polypropylene (PP) siding has been introduced; PP provides a stronger product, which allows for deeper patterns and better edge detailing. PP siding, compared to traditional wood siding, doesn’t warp, crack, or degrade as easily with extended exposure to the elements, and is cheaper to maintain. However, even plastic siding must be coated. The requirements of a coating for siding are good adhesion, durability, and a suitable appearance. However, polypropylene, like many plastics, has a low surface energy, making wetting and coating adhesion difficult. One of the many ways to increase the surface energy of polypropylene, thus increasing wettability and adhesion, is plasma treatment. The primary focus of this project was to study how plasma treatment improved adhesion of a water-reducible coating. This coating represented a product used in commercial siding. The surface tension of the panels was increased from ~ 30 dynes/cm to 60 + dynes/cm with plasma treatment. This increased the adhesion of the coating to the polypropylene panel from virtually no adhesion to almost perfect adhesion. Adhesion was tested according to ASTM D 3359, the crosscut adhesion test. Pull-off adhesion testing (ASTM D 4541 - 09) was also conducted, using a Deflesko PosiTest AT-A automatic adhesion tester. The average force needed to remove a dolly from a plasma treated panel was 233 ± 47 psi (1, 605 ± 325 kPa), compared to 92 ± 26 psi (634 ± 179 kPa) for non-treated and corona treated panels. The sponsor of the project provided Cal Poly with 16 different compositions of polypropylene containing different amounts of UV stabilizers, adhesion promoters, and lubricants. The effect of substrate composition on coating adhesion and performance was measured. Crosscut adhesion testing results revealed all polypropylene compositions improved from virtually no adhesion to perfect adhesion after plasma treatment. Pull-off adhesion testing revealed the adhesion force of all compositions improved from less than 100 psi to greater than 200 psi. One polypropylene composition, Category 16, resulted in unusually high pull-off forces. This composition was investigated using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and FT-IR spectroscopy. XPS was used to examine the surface composition between non-treated and plasma treated PP panels. It was observed that plasma treatment provides a larger amount of oxygen species and nitrogen when compared to untreated panels. The category 16 panels did not reveal any significant surface differences compared to the category 7 panels (which represented the standard production material). FT-IR spectroscopy of the category 16 panels also showed no unusual characteristics. The secondary focus of this project was to study the durability of coated, plasma treated polypropylene siding. Accelerated weathering testing was conducted on 12 of the 16 different compositions of polypropylene. Changes in gloss and the LAB colorspace of coated, plasma treated polypropylene panels of different compositions, upon exposure to long-term weathering conditions, were monitored via ASTM G 53 using a Q-Panel lab product QUV/se weathering tester. After 2400 hours, all PP compositions tested shared negligible changes in color, but the gloss of each category panel showed a steady increase. An approach to improve durability of siding is to apply a clearcoat over already coated PP panels. This approach was tested in a limited manner by adding a clearcoat to coated, plasma treated polypropylene panels. These panels were then exposed to a variety of common, <b>household</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> using a modified double rub test (ASTM D 4752 and ASTM D 5402). The samples with a clearcoat showed improved cleaning agent resistance compared to samples without the clearcoat...|$|E

Endokrin bozucu özellikleri olduğu bilinen ve noniyonik yüzey aktif maddelerin bileşiminde bulunan alkil fenol polietoksilat metabolitlerinin konvansiyonel fiziksel, biyolojik ve kimyasal arıtma yöntemleri ile giderimleri yetersiz kalmaktadır. Bu nedenle alkil fenol polietoksilatların ve alkil fenollerin ileri oksidasyon prosesleri gibi ileri arıtma yöntemleri ile giderim çalışmaları ve uygulamaları son yıllarda önem kazanmıştır. İleri oksidasyon prosesleri arasında hızları ve yüksek giderim verimleri nedeniyle Fenton, Fenton-benzeri ve Foto-Fenton proseslerinin atıksu ve su arıtımında sorunlu kirleticilerin oksidasyonu için tercih edilmektedir. Son yıllarda ekonomik, kolay uygulanabilir ve etkin olması nedeniyle hidrojen peroksit ve persülfat gibi oksidanlarla aktive edilebilen sıfır değerlikli demir ile arıtma prosesleri dikkat çekmektedir.   Yukarıdaki bilgiler ışığında bu tez kapsamında, bir oktil fenol polietoksilat bileşiği olan noniyonik bir yüzey aktif maddenin (ticari ismi: Triton X- 45), persülfat (S 2 O 82 -) iyonları ile aktive edilmiş sıfır değerlikli demir kullanılarak arıtımı incelenmiştir. Yüzey aktif maddenin Persülfat/Sıfır değerlikli demir ileri oksidasyon sistemi ile arıtılabilirliği üç aşamada çalışılmıştır. Birinci aşamada, prosesi etkileyen parametrelerin (katalizör konsantrayonu, oksidan konsantrasyonu, pH, arıtma süresi) oksidasyon verimi üzerindeki etkileri araştırılmış, yüzey aktif madde (20 mg/L sulu çözelti) ve TOK giderimi bazında {{optimize}} edilmiştir. En uygun pH değeri 5, optimum persülfat konsantrasyonu 2. 5 mM, optimum katalizör konsantrasyonu 1 g/L, optimum arıtma süresi 60 dk. olarak belirlenmiştir.

Surfactants are {{organic chemicals}} that reduce surface tension {{in water and}} other liquids. The most familiar use for surfactants are soaps, laundry detergents, dishwashing liquids and shampoos. They are {{a diverse group of}} chemicals with unique cleaning and/or solubilisation properties. They usually consist of a polar (hydrophilic) and a nonpolar (hydrophobic) group. Due to their amphiphilic nature they are widely used in <b>household</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> (detergents), personal care products, textiles, paints, inks, polymers, pesticide formulations, pharmaceuticals, mining, oil recovery as well as pulp and paper industries. Surfactants enter the environment mainly through the discharge of sewage effluents into natural water and the application sewage sludge on land for soil fertilizing purposes. Most of the commercial surfactants used today by different industries are only partially and slowly biodegradable; they tend to sorb and accumulate on sludge and soil  sediments. causing a potential ecotoxicological and pollution risk in the environment. Moreover, the metabolites of some alkyl phenol ethoxylates have recently been declared as hormone mimicking/endocrine disrupting compounds. Therefore, the efficient management and treatment of surfactants remains a serious challenge. In this respect, more effective {{and at the same time}} economically feasible abatement processes have to be developed to alleviate the problem of surfactants/surfactant metabolites in the environment. Alkylphenol polyethoxylates are industrial compounds belonging to the class of nonionic surfactants that are designed to have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. Among them, octylphenol polyethoxylates have been widely used in cleaning products, paints, ink dispersants, textile preparation and leather processing, manufacture of pulp and paper, metalworking, cosmetics and personal care products. However, many of these applications are now restricted by the European Commission due to the raising concerns regarding the environmental safety of alkylphenol (poly) ethoxylates and its metabolites. It has been reported that their aerobic / anaerobic transformation products (alkylphenols such as nonylphenol and octylphenol) are much more inhibitory and estrogenic than the original surfactants. Despite the above-mentioned concerns regarding the use of alkylphenol (poly) ethoxylates, these products still appear in several industrial applications where they cannot not be replaced by alternative chemicals due to technical and economic reasons. Consequently, the presence of these nonionic surfactants and their degradation products have been reported in water bodies, sediments and sludge associated with the continuing discharges from industrial and sewage treatment plants.   The scientific literature on the biodergadability and fate of alkylphenol polyethoxylates in the aquatic as well as terrestrial environment reinforces the idea that more efficient, alternative treatment processes are needed for their effective elimination. Besides conventional biochemical, chemical and physical treatment methods, chemical oxidation (ozonation, advanced oxidation) has been extensively studied as an alternative for the treatment of nonionic surfactants and their metabolites. Among the existing hydroxyl radicals (HO•) -induced advanced oxidation processes, TiO 2 /UV, H 2 O 2 /UV, O 3 /UV, H 2 O 2 /UV, Fenton and Photo-Fenton processes have attracted considerable interest since these exhibit relatively high treatment efficiencies and kinetics. More recently, sulfate radicals (SO 4 •-) -driven advanced oxidation processes have been investigated to treat pollutants found in water and wastewater. The reduction potential of SO 4 •- is lower than that of HO• (2. 6 versus 2. 9 eV); however, SO 4 •- are also capable of non-selectively and rapidly reacting with pollutants in a series of free radical chain reactions being similar to those established for HO•-based advanced oxidation processes. SO 4 •- can be produced from persulfate ions via chemical, radiolytic, thermal or photochemical activation; or alternatively by redox reactions with transition metals as in the case of the Fenton’s reagent. An alternative to iron-based (Fenton-like) advanced oxidation processes are zero valent iron (ZVI; Fe 0) catalyzed treatment systems. They have received global interest and promising results have been reported so far for the removal of chlorinated organics, nitroaromatic compounds, arsenic, heavy metals, nitrate, industrial dyes and phenols by micro-and nanoscale ZVI. ZVI is reactive (redox potential = - 0. 44 eV), non-toxic, abundant, cheap, relatively easy to produce and its treatment applications require little maintenance. ZVI is capable of oxidizing organic as well as inorganic pollutants by an electron transfer mechanism. However, for harsher conditions, ZVI treatment has to be enhanced chemical or thermally by the involvement of oxidants (for example, hydrogen peroxide or persulfate). Besides, the extensive follow-up of toxicity is critical to ensure economically and ecologically safe applications of advanced oxidation processes. The ecotoxicological characterization of sulfate radical-based treatment systems during their application to treat industrial pollutants is an untouched area in this research field. For this purpose, bioassays employing the marine photobacterium Vibrio fischeri remain the most popular test protocols since these enable easy and rapid measurement of cytotoxicity in water and wastewater samples being subjected to advanced oxidation. Although V. fischeri is very sensitive and hence useful for obtaining a preliminary idea about the inhibitory effect of pollutants and their degradation products, it is more appropriate to support toxicity results with other types of test organisms preferably from different trophic levels. For example, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata are important freshwater microalage being routinely used as primary producers ito assess the acute and chronic toxicity of surfactants.   Considering the above facts, the motivation of the present work was to study the treatability and acute toxicity of the commercially important nonionic surfactant octylphenol polyethoxylate (known as “Triton X- 45 ”) in aqueous solution with the ZVI/S 2 O 82 - advanced oxidation system. To our knowledge, this was the first study investigating the treatability of a nonionic surfactant with persulfate activated ZVI nanoparticles. Within the scope of this experimental study, firstly, preliminary optimization tests were performed under varying reaction conditions (ZVI and persulfate concentrations, pH’s and treatment time) together with control runs (ZVI only and persulfte only expeirments). Thereafter, time dependent changes in the surfactant, TOC, persulfate concentrations and pH were followed for the optimized treatment system. Then, the acute toxicity of the nonionic surfactant and its degradation products was also followed by employing two different bioassays with V. fischeri and P. subcapitata. It can be said that, OPEO has corrosive and toxic effects on people and other organisms. Results indicated that the nonionic surfactant solution (20 mg/L original concentration) could be degraded in less than 1 hour (40 - 60) by 95 % accompanied with up to 40 % TOC removal by 1 g/L ZVI nanoparticles activated with 2. 5 mM (480 mg/L) persulfate at an initial reaction pH of 5. 0. The acute toxicities (percent relative inhibition rates) decreased significantly from originally 66 % to 21 % and originally 16 % to non-toxic for V. fischeri and P. subcapitata, respectively. The photobacterium V. fischeri appeared to be more sensitive to octylphenol polyethoxylate and its degradation products than the microalgae P. subcapitata. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
