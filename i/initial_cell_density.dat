40|$|High <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>density</b> {{is used to}} {{increase}} volumetric productivity and shorten production time in lignocellulosic hydrolysate fermentation. Comparison of physiological parameters in high <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>density</b> cultivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{in the presence of}} acetic, formic, levulinic and cinnamic acids demonstrated general and acid-specific responses of cells. All the acids studied impaired growth and inhibited glycolytic flux, and caused oxidative stress and accumulation of trehalose. However, trehalose may play a role other than protecting yeast cells from acid-induced oxidative stress. Unlike the other acids, cinnamic acid did not cause depletion of cellular ATP, but abolished the growth of yeast on ethanol. Compared with low <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>density,</b> increasing <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>density</b> reduced the lag phase and improved the bioconversion yield of cinnamic acid during acid adaptation. In addition, yeast cells were able to grow at elevated concentrations of acid, probable due to the increase in phenotypic cell-to-cell heterogeneity in large inoculum size. Furthermore, the specific growth rate and the specific rates of glucose consumption and metabolite production were significantly lower than at low <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>density,</b> which was a result of the accumulation of a large fraction of cells that persisted in a viable but non-proliferating state...|$|E

40|$|In nature, most {{bacteria}} live in surface-attached sedentary communities {{known as}} biofilms. Biofilms are often studied {{with respect to}} bacterial interactions. Many cells inhabiting biofilms are assumed to express 'cooperative traits', like the secretion of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). These traits can enhance biofilm-related properties, such as stress resilience or colony expansion, while being costly to the cells that express them. In well-mixed populations cooperation is difficult to achieve, because non-cooperative individuals can {{reap the benefits of}} cooperation without having to pay the costs. The physical process of biofilm growth can, however, result in the spatial segregation of cooperative from non-cooperative individuals. This segregation can prevent non-cooperative cells from exploiting cooperative neighbors. Here we examine the interaction between spatial pattern formation and cooperation in Bacillus subtilis biofilms. We show, experimentally and by mathematical modeling, that the <b>density</b> of <b>cells</b> at the onset of biofilm growth affects pattern formation during biofilm growth. At low <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>densities,</b> co-cultured strains strongly segregate in space, whereas spatial segregation does not occur at high <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>densities.</b> As a consequence, EPS-producing cells have a competitive advantage over non-cooperative mutants when biofilms are initiated at a low <b>density</b> of founder <b>cells,</b> whereas EPS-deficient cells have an advantage at high <b>cell</b> <b>densities.</b> These results underline the importance of spatial pattern formation for competition among bacterial strains and the evolution of microbial cooperation...|$|R

To quantify the relative roles of cell migration and proliferation, we calibrate the solution of the Fisher–Kolmogorov model to cell density profiles to provide estimates of the cell diffusivity, D, and the cell proliferation rate, λ. This procedure indicates that the estimates of D and λ are very sensitive to the initial density. This dependence suggests that the Fisher–Kolmogorov model does not accurately represent the details of the collective cell spreading process, since this model assumes that D and λ are constants that ought to be independent of the initial density. Since higher <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>density</b> leads to enhanced spreading, we also calibrate the solution of the Porous–Fisher model to the data as this model assumes that the cell flux is an increasing function of the cell density.

Starch accumulated during days, and decreased during nights. In the control treatments with continuous light in addition to daylight, dry weight and starch increased evenly throughout the experiment, before the growth stagnated and decreased 5 - 6 days into the experiment. The effect of the <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> was not significant between the treatments. In the simulated light experiments, cultures were treated with 6 hours light periods of 500 and 1000 µmol m- 2 s- 1, both with continuous backlight of 200 µmol m- 2 s- 1, in addition to a control of continuous 200 µmol m- 2 s- 1. The cultures were analysed for dry weight, starch, chlorophyll and photoinhibition. Results showed that the cultures in high light treatments suffered dynamic photoinhibition. Cells in the medium light treatment were also photoinhibited, but on a lower level. However, dry weight and starch did not differ significantly between the three treatments. Chlorophyll decreased severely during the light periods. As dry weight of all experiments was lower than expected, the effects of air bubbling (CO 2) velocity and content of calcium, magnesium or tap water in the growth medium were also tested.

A strong up-regulation of MMP 13 expression was measured at day 12 in floating gels. The composition of cartilage-like tissue obtained by growing chondrocytes in a collagen gel varied depending on the floating or attached conditions and <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>density.</b> It is thus important to consider these parameters when using this culture system in order to prepare a well-defined implant for cartilage repair. This study {{evaluated the}} in vitro behaviour of bovine chondrocytes seeded in collagen gels, promising recently reported scaffolds {{for the treatment of}} full-thickness cartilage defects. To determine how chondrocytes respond to a collagen gel environment, 2 x 10 (6) chondrocytes isolated from fetal, calf and adult bovine cartilage were seeded within type I collagen gels and grown for 12 days in both attached and floating (detached from the culture dish after polymerisation) conditions. Monolayer cultures were performed in parallel. All chondrocytes contracted floating gels to 55 % of the initial size, by day 12. Contraction was dependent on <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>density</b> and inhibited by the presence of dihydrocytochalasin B as previously observed with fibroblasts.

It was found that higher growth rate achieved at higher light intensity 350 – 370  μmol m− 2 s− 1 and longer photoperiod 18 : 6. Usage of high intensity LED with narrow beam angle possibly helped in improving microalgae cultivation in deep culture and high volume such as bubble column PBR, provided that optimum <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>density,</b> lighting parameter and cultivation method to be reviewed.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{study the effects of}} <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>density</b> and in vitro culture method on the {{construction}} of tissue-engineered bone grafts and osteogenic activities. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were seeded onto cubic scaffolds prepared from demineralized bone matrix (DBM) by three methods - static, hydrodynamic, or fibrin hydrogel-assisted seeding. The resulting cell-scaffold constructs were cultured in vitro by static flask culture or hydrodynamic culture. The <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>density</b> and the subsequent in vitro proliferation and alkaline phosphate activities of the constructs were analyzed. The constructs were also subcutaneously implanted in nude mice to examine their in vivo osteogenic activities. Hydrogel-assisted seeding gave the highest seeding efficiency, followed by hydrodynamic and conventional static seeding. During in vitro culture, hydrodynamic culture produced higher plateau cell densities, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities, and extracellular matrix production than static culture. After subcutaneous implantation in nude mice, the implants prepared by the combination of hydrogel-assisted seeding and hydrodynamic culture produced higher wet weight and bone mineral density than implants prepared by other methods. The results suggest that the hydrogel-assisted seeding can substantially increase the initial seed cell density in scaffolds. Subsequent hydrodynamic culture can promote the proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation of the seeded cells. Correspondingly, bone grafts produced by the combination of these two methods achieved the highest osteogenic activity among the three methods employed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMost natural conjugative IncF {{plasmids}} encode a fertility inhibition {{system that}} represses transfer gene {{expression in the}} majority of plasmid-carrying cells. The successful spread of these plasmids in clinically relevant bacteria has been suggested to be supported by a transitory derepression of transfer gene expression in newly formed transconjugants. In this study, we aimed to monitor the extent of transitory derepression during agar surface matings in situ by comparing plasmid spread of the IncF plasmid R 1 and its derepressed mutant R 1 drd 19 at low <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>densities.</b> A zygotic induction strategy was used to visualize the spatial distribution of fluorescent transconjugants within the heterogeneous environment. Epifluorescence and confocal microscopy revealed different transfer patterns for both plasmids, however, spread beyond the first five recipient cell layers adjacent to the donor cells was not observed. Similar results were observed for other prototypical conjugative plasmids. These results cannot rule out that transitory derepression contributes to the limited R 1 plasmid invasion, but other factors like nutrient availability or spatial structure seem to limit plasmid spread...|$|R
40|$|The high {{affinity}} of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG- 1 for {{liquid hydrocarbons}} permitted {{the isolation of}} a spontaneous nonadherent mutant, MR- 481. Strain MR- 481 exhibited no significant affinity for three test hydrocarbons, yet resembled the wild type in many properties, including production of the extracellular emulsifying agent emulsan. To study the role of adherence in growth on hydrocarbons, RAG- 1 and MR- 481 were compared for growth on hexadecane under conditions of limited agitation and at low <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>densities.</b> Adherent RAG- 1 cells were able to grow rapidly under these conditions, whereas nonadherent MR- 481 cells failed to grow for at least 54 h. However, the addition of emulsan either initially or at various times after inoculation enabled the nonadherent MR- 481 cells to grow on hexadecane. Growth was {{not the result of}} reversion of MR- 481 from nonadherent to adherent cells. The data demonstrate that adherence is a crucial factor in the growth of A. calcoaceticus RAG- 1 on hexadecane in the absence of extracellular emulsification of the substrate...|$|R
40|$|The reductive {{dechlorination}} of trichloroethene (TCE) in a TCE source zone can be self-inhibited by TCE toxicity. A {{study was}} set up to examine the toxicity of TCE in terms of species specific degradation kinetics and microbial growth and to evaluate models that describe this self-inhibition. A batch experiment was performed using the TCE dechlorinating KB- 1 culture at initial TCE concentrations ranging from 0. 04 mM to saturation (8. 4 mM). Biodegradation activity was highest at 0. 3 mM TCE and no activity was found at concentrations from 4 to 8 mM. Species specific TCE and cis-DCE (cis-dichloroethene) degradation rates and Dehalococcoides numbers were modeled with Monod kinetics combined with either Haldane inhibition or a log-logistic dose-response inhibition on these rates. The log-logistic toxicity model appeared the most appropriate model and predicts that the species specific degradation activities are reduced by a factor 2 at about 1 mM TCE, respectively cis-DCE. However, the model showed that the inhibitive effects on the time for TCE to ethene degradation are a complex function of degradation kinetics and the <b>initial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>densities</b> of the clechlorinating species. Our analysis suggests that the self-inhibition on biodegradation cannot be predicted by a single concentration threshold without information on the <b>cell</b> <b>densities.</b> (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
