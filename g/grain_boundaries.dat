5|$|The {{strengthening}} {{effect of}} forming stable metal carbides at the <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> {{and the strong}} increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The high-speed tool steels contain between 3 and 5% chromium. Stainless steel, the main corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when chromium is added to iron in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium {{is added to the}} molten iron. Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries.</b> For example, Inconel 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel superalloys, they are used in jet engines and gas turbines in lieu of common structural materials.|$|E
5|$|Gallium attacks {{most other}} metals by {{diffusing}} into the metal lattice. For example, it diffuses into the <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> of aluminium-zinc alloys and steel, making them very brittle. Gallium easily alloys with many metals, {{and is used}} in small quantities in the plutonium-gallium alloy in the plutonium cores of nuclear bombs to stabilize the plutonium crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is added}} to copper alloys such as brass and bronze, to improve {{machinability}} and for its lubricating qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries.</b> In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E
40|$|In this study, the structure, the energetic, and the {{strength}} of a symmetric tilt <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> in magnesium and magnesium binary alloys were analyzed in the framework of (semi-) empirical potentials. Following a systematic investigation of the transferability and accuracy of the interatomic potentials, atomistic calculations of the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> energy, the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> sliding energy, and the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> strength were performed in pure magnesium and in binary MgX alloys (X = Al, Ca, Gd, Li, Sn, Y, Ag, Nd, and Pb). The data gained in this study were analyzed to identify the most critical material parameters controlling {{the strength}} of the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary,</b> and their consequence on atomic shuffling motions occurring at the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary.</b> From the methodology perspective, the role of in-plane and out-of plane relaxation on the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> sliding energy curves was investigated. In pure magnesium, the results showed that in-plane relaxation is critical in activating twinning dislocation resulting in <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> migration. In the alloy systems, however, <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> migration was disabled {{as a consequence of the}} pinning of the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> by segregated elements. Finally, while the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> energy, the shape of the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> sliding energy curves, and the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> sliding energy are critical parameters controlling the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> strength in pure magnesium, only the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> energy and the segregation energy of the alloying elements at the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> were identified as critical material parameters in the alloys system...|$|R

40|$|Orientation imaging {{microscopy}} {{has been}} used to investigate the effects of Nb doping on the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> plane distributions in TiO 2 (rutile). By comparing the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> plane distribution of the undoped material with theoretical estimates of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> energy anisotropy of pure rutile, it is possible to show that the frequency of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> planes is inversely correlated with <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> energy. In the case of Nb-doped material, this inverse correlation can also be demonstrated by a comparison of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> plane frequency with measurements of surface energy anisotropy. In addition, by comparing the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> plane distribution of doped and undoped materials with previous measurements of Nb <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> segregation in TiO 2, as a function of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> plane orientation, it is possible to explain the changes in <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> plane distribution which result from doping...|$|R

He studied the details of faults and <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> in metals, and developed theoretical models of them. In 1961, he moved to MIT as an Institute Professor with appointments in both the Departments of Humanities and Metallurgy. He applied the techniques of metallurgy {{to the study of}} the production methods used to create artefacts such as samurai swords.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{manganese}} improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing {{the formation of}} a liquid iron sulfide at the <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries.</b> If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high tensile strength of up to 863MPa. Steel with 12% manganese was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel. It was used for British military steel helmets and later by the U.S. military.|$|E
5|$|Copper, silver, {{and gold}} are in group 11 of the {{periodic}} table; these three metals have one s-orbital electron {{on top of}} a filled d-electron shell and are characterized by high ductility, and electrical and thermal conductivity. The filled d-shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper. At the macroscopic scale, introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice, such as <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries,</b> hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A mesoscale, variational {{simulation}} of grain growth in two-dimensions {{has been used}} to explore the effects of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> properties on the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> character distribution. Anisotropy in the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> energy has a stronger influence on the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> character distribution than anisotropy in the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> mobility. As <b>grain</b> growth proceeds from an initially random distribution, the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> character distribution reaches a steady state that depends on the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> energy. If the energy depends only on the lattice misorientation, then the population and energy are related by the Boltzmann distribution. When the energy depends on both lattice misorientation and boundary orientation, the steady state <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> character distribution is more complex and depends on both the energy and changes in the gradient of the energy with respect to orientation...|$|R

40|$|The {{migration}} kinetics of sigma 9, sigma 51 and {{low angle}} tilt boundaries in Fe- 3 wt%Si solid solution bicrystals was experimentally studied at temperatures between 1200 and 1625 K by a capillarity technique. The driving {{force and the}} mobility of the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> migration were calculated from the experimental results. On {{the basis of the}} calculations, the mechanism of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> migration was discussed. There are two different mechanisms of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> migration. At low temperatures, the activation energy of the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> migration coincides with that of the intrinsic diffusion of Si in alpha-Fe. The rate controlling process of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> migration seems to be the dragging of solute atmosphere formed along the migrating <b>grain</b> <b>boundary.</b> On the other hand, at high temperatures, the activation energy of the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> migration is about 2 / 3 of that of the self diffusion in alpha-Fe. Therefore, the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> migration at these temperatures is considered to be controlled by the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> diffusion...|$|R
5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E
5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> are {{in general}} {{only a few}} {{nanometers}} wide. In common materials, crystallites are large enough that <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> account for {{a small fraction of}} the material. However, very small grain sizes are achievable. In nanocrystalline solids, <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> become a significant volume fraction of the material, with profound effects on such properties as diffusion and plasticity. In the limit of small crystallites, as the volume fraction of <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> approaches 100%, the material ceases to have any crystalline character, and thus becomes an amorphous solid.|$|E

The model is based on biased topological changes in the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> network that eliminate and create <b>boundaries</b> during <b>grain</b> growth. The <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> energy influences the rates of these topological changes by altering the relative areas of the interfaces. The model predicts <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> character distributions that are inversely related to the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> energy and are consistent with experimental observations...|$|R

Literature data on <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> {{properties}} show surprisingly in {{some cases}} reversed courses of the structural dependences than expected, or directly prove their qualitative changes with changing temperature. This “reversed anisotropy ” is demonstrated for example of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> segregation.

25|$|<b>Grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> {{disrupt the}} motion of dislocations through a material, so {{reducing}} crystallite size is a common way to improve strength, as described by the Hall–Petch relationship. Since <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> are defects in the crystal structure they tend to decrease the electrical and thermal conductivity of the material. The high interfacial energy and relatively weak bonding in most <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> often makes them preferred sites for the onset of corrosion and for the precipitation of new phases from the solid.

25|$|First, {{although}} single crystals of YBCO have a {{very high}} critical current density, polycrystals {{have a very}} low critical current density: only a small current can be passed while maintaining superconductivity. This problem is due to crystal <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> in the material. When the grain boundary angle is greater than about 5°, the supercurrent cannot cross the boundary. The grain boundary problem can be controlled to some extent by preparing thin films via CVD or by texturing the material to align the <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries.</b>|$|E

25|$|Glass is in {{widespread}} use {{largely due to}} the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light. In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (<b>grain</b> <b>boundaries)</b> reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light {{in the same manner as}} a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing—i.e., colored.|$|E

Explicit analytic expressions {{of stress and}} lattice rotation jumps are thus derived at a planar interface in the general framework of heterogeneous anisotropic thermo-elasticity with plasticity and <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> sliding. Both elastic fields are directly dependent on in-plane gradients of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> sliding. It is also shown that <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> sliding is a mechanism that may relax incompatibility stresses of elastic, plastic and thermal origin although the latter are not resolved on the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> plane.
