5|$|Poetry uses {{forms and}} {{conventions}} to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, <b>irony</b> <b>and</b> other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly figures of speech such as metaphor, simile and metonymy create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.|$|E

25|$|Cankar was a {{relatively}} fragile personality, both emotionally and physically, but showed an unusually strong and persistent intellectual vigour. He was a sharp thinker, who was able of poignant criticism of both his environment and himself. He was also full of paradoxes and loved <b>irony</b> <b>and</b> sarcasm. He was an unusually sentimental and somehow ecstatic nature, intensely sensitive to ethical issues. He was very introspective: his works, which are {{to a large extent}} autobiographic, became famous for the ruthless analysis of his own deeds and misdeeds.|$|E

The author that, through his work, with skill, sensitivity and beauty, gives exuberance to his work doesn’t forget the <b>irony</b> <b>and</b> the paradox, essentially intellectual resources.|$|E

The most diverse and opposite of sentiments, cruel deceptions, ambitious desires, burning tenderness, grievous sacrifices, all the torments of the heart, acquire in her singing that mysterious truth, I would like to say, that psychological sonority, which is the primary attraction of opera.|$|E

25|$|On 29 September 1841, Kierkegaard {{wrote and}} defended his dissertation, On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates. The {{university}} panel considered it noteworthy and thoughtful, but too informal and witty {{for a serious}} academic thesis. The thesis dealt with <b>irony</b> <b>and</b> Schelling's 1841 lectures, which Kierkegaard had attended with Mikhail Bakunin, Jacob Burckhardt, and Friedrich Engels; each had come away with a different perspective. Kierkegaard graduated from university on 20 October 1841 with a Magister Artium. He was able to fund his education, his living, and several publications of his early works with his family's inheritance of approximately 31,000 rigsdaler.|$|E
25|$|The Romantic artists had {{a passion}} for the {{national}} and the past. The early part of the 19th century was a difficult time both politically and economically for Denmark, and this naturally generated a glorification of times past. The emergent bourgeoisie needed to consolidate its cultural status and found motifs for this in national folklore. The economic growth in a rapidly expanding Copenhagen had to some extent overshadowed spiritual development. Artists interpreted their contemporary society in a purely materialistic light. Oehlenschläger's poem about The Golden Horns (Guldhornene) is probably the most famous example of this issue but Hans Christian Andersen's fairytale The Bell (Klokken) depicted the materialistic fixation of the period with humour, <b>irony</b> <b>and</b> gravity.|$|E

His Scînteia articles were noted for their bitter <b>irony</b> <b>and</b> for the vehemence of the insults they addressed to political enemies, in particular the National Peasants' Party and its organ Dreptatea. He was among the fiercest critics of multiparty, pluralist democracy, together with Silviu Brucan, Ștefan Voicu, Sorin Toma, Nestor Ignat, Nicolae Moraru, Miron Radu Paraschivescu and Traian Șelmaru. Răutu later recruited the core of the PMR's ideologists from his group.|$|E

40|$|According to Gibbs and Colston, one of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} for irony research is the uncovering of the various ways in which irony is used in discourse. This article takes up a genre-based approach to deal with this research challenge. In a content analysis of ironic utterances from six written genres (commercial and noncommercial advertisements, columns, cartoons, letters to the editor, book and film reviews), ironic utterances are compared on the usage of <b>irony</b> factors <b>and</b> <b>irony</b> markers. Results indicate that every genre in the corpus differs from the general distribution for at least one <b>irony</b> factor <b>and</b> one category of irony markers. Taken together, the clustering of <b>irony</b> factors <b>and</b> markers in specific genres is a first step toward identifying the various ways in which verbal irony is used differently across various genres. © 2012 SAGE Publications...|$|R

25|$|Cohn disliked Welles's rough cut, {{particularly}} the confusing plot {{and lack of}} close-ups, and was not in sympathy with Welles's Brechtian use of <b>irony</b> <b>and</b> black comedy, especially in a farcical courtroom scene. Cohn ordered extensive editing and re-shoots. After heavy editing by the studio, approximately one hour of Welles's first cut was removed, including much of a climactic confrontation scene in an amusement park funhouse. While expressing displeasure at the cuts, Welles was appalled particularly with the musical score. The film was considered a disaster in America {{at the time of}} release, though the closing shootout in a hall of mirrors has since become a touchstone of film noir. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce.|$|E
25|$|There is {{critical}} debate over exactly what genre of play Seascape is. Some {{believe it is}} a comedy, while others see it as absurdist, satirical, or allegorical. Most agree that an element of fantasy is involved. While Nancy and Charlie are humans and act accordingly, Leslie and Sarah are fantastic creations. They are human-sized lizards that have left their life in the sea to live on land. They speak perfect English and understand some aspects of human life. Charlie {{has a hard time}} accepting that they are real. He wants to believe that he and Nancy see them because they are suffering from food poisoning or are dead. In terms of the play Leslie and Sarah are very real, a fact that Nancy immediately grasps and embraces. The fantasy aspect of the play creates dramatic <b>irony</b> <b>and</b> allows issues such as progress, values, and differences to be discussed.|$|E
25|$|Sheldon is {{a senior}} {{theoretical}} physicist at Caltech and shared an apartment with his colleague and best friend, Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki). However, Sheldon now lives across the hall with his fiancée Amy, in the former apartment of Leonard's wife Penny. He is a former child prodigy with genius level IQ, but displays an almost total lack of social skills, a tenuous understanding of humor, and difficulty recognizing <b>irony</b> <b>and</b> sarcasm in other people, although he himself often employs them. He exhibits highly idiosyncratic behavior and {{a general lack of}} humility or empathy. He also lacks toleration. These characteristics provide the majority of the humor involving him, which has caused him to be described as the show's breakout character. Despite speculation that Sheldon's personality traits may be consistent with Asperger syndrome, obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, and asexuality, co-creator Bill Prady has repeatedly stated that Sheldon's character was neither conceived nor developed with regard to any of these traits.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{history of}} the colonial world is {{interpreted}} differently by western historians and “nativist ” historians and ethnologists. The colonialist perspective of history often disregards an entire phase of history before the colonial period, exalting the colonialist enterprise. On the other hand, ethnologists and native historians stress indigenous sources of history, including oral accounts. The paper, Historical Perspectives in Master Narratives: <b>Ironies</b> <b>and</b> Subversions in the Novels of Cary and Achebe, places the literary works of Joyce Cary (1880 - 1957) and Chinua Achebe (1930 -) in their historical context as reflecting either colonialist or “nativist ” discourse, yet assesses their deviations from these historical traditions {{with the objective of}} exploring the common theme of <b>ironies</b> <b>and</b> subversions that undercut master-narratives. Cary’s novels reflect colonialist accounts of African history while Achebe attempts to give authority and validity to oral sources of African history. Yet both novelists initiate a critique of the dominant ideology...|$|R

25|$|Ruiz de Burton uses <b>irony</b> <b>and</b> satire to mock American {{political}} discourses {{and practices}} by ridiculing socio-political {{structures of the}} period. Using a variety of rogues, who have pretentious and comical names, Ruiz de Burton represents the vices of nineteenth-century middle-class society. The preachers, Mr. Hackwell and Mr. Hammerhard, the neighbors, the Cackles, and other political figures in Who Would Have Thought It? are unmasked to break down ideological myths of American political rhetoric by contrasting {{the expectations of the}} nation with the reality of their actions. American expectations include promoting civil virtue and acting against corruption. However, Mr. Hackwell, the primary religious figure in the novel, schemes to increase his wealth in order to satisfy his ravenous greed. The Cackles clan represents Northern politicians who are only motivated by self-interest. Ruiz de Burton implies that the national practice of self-deception, misrepresentation and secrecy are deeply rooted in the American character, though very rarely revealed. Juxtaposed to this satire of American life are the virtues of the good and beautiful Lola.|$|E
25|$|Distinct {{appearance}} and clothing {{was one of}} the immediate legacies of hippies worldwide. During the 1960s and 1970s, mustaches, beards and long hair became more commonplace and colorful, while multi-ethnic clothing dominated the fashion world. Since that time, a wide range of personal appearance options and clothing styles, including nudity, have become more widely acceptable, all of which was uncommon before the hippie era. Hippies also inspired the decline in popularity of the necktie and other business clothing, which had been unavoidable for men during the 1950s and early 1960s. Additionally, hippie fashion itself has been commonplace in the years since the 1960s in clothing and accessories, particularly the peace symbol. Astrology, including everything from serious study to whimsical amusement regarding personal traits, was integral to hippie culture. The generation of the 1970s became influenced by the hippie and the 60s countercultural legacy. As such in New York City musicians and audiences from the female, homosexual, black, and Latino communities adopted several traits from the hippies and psychedelia. They included overwhelming sound, free-form dancing, weird lighting, colorful costumes, and hallucinogens. Psychedelic soul groups like the Chambers Brothers and especially Sly and The Family Stone influenced proto-disco acts such as Isaac Hayes, Willie Hutch and the Philadelphia Sound. In addition, the perceived positivity, lack of <b>irony,</b> <b>and</b> earnestness of the hippies informed proto-disco music like M.F.S.B.'s album Love Is the Message.|$|E
