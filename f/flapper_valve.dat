2500|$|At {{the top of}} {{the toilet}} bowl is a rim with many angled drain holes that are fed from the tank, which fill, rinse, and induce {{swirling}} in the bowl when it is flushed. Mounted above the toilet is a large holding tank with approximately [...] of water in modern designs. This tank is built with a large drain [...] diameter hole at its bottom covered by a <b>flapper</b> <b>valve</b> that allows the water to rapidly leave the holding tank. The plumbing is built to allow entry of the tank’s water into the toilet in a very short period. This water pours through the holes in the rim and a siphon jet hole about [...] diameter {{in the bottom of the}} toilet. Some designs use a large hole in the front of the rim to allow faster filling of the bowl.|$|E
2500|$|When a user flushes a toilet, a [...] "toilet flapper valve" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with a type of check valve) opens and allows water from a reservoir tank to quickly enter the toilet bowl. This rapid influx from the tank causes the swirling water in the bowl to rapidly rise and fill the U-shaped inverted siphon tube mounted {{in the back of the}} toilet. This full siphon tube starts the toilet's siphonic action. The siphon action quickly (4–7 seconds) “pulls” nearly all of the water and waste in the bowl and the on-rushing tank water down the drain—it flushes. When most of the water has drained out of the bowl, the continuous column of water up and over the bottom of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe (the siphon) is broken when air enters the siphon tube. The toilet then gives its characteristic gurgle as the siphonic action ceases and no more water flows out of the toilet. After flushing, the <b>flapper</b> <b>valve</b> in the water tank closes; water lines and valves connected to the water supply refill the toilet tank and bowl. Then the toilet is again ready for use.|$|E

5000|$|These valves are {{commonly}} uni-directional <b>flapper</b> <b>valves</b> which open downwards {{such that the}} flow of [...] wellbore fluids tries to push it shut, while pressure from the surface pushes it open.

The disconnect provides for shutoff of the propellant flow area by simultaneous action of two rotary <b>flapper</b> <b>valves</b> (orbiter and external tank) prior to disconnect separation. In the case of pneumatic system failure, the rotary <b>flapper</b> <b>valves</b> are closed automatically through mechanical interlocking linkage during disconnect separation. The mechanism must meet requirements while accommodating changes in bearing clearances and linkage geometry over a wide temperature range from ambient to 20. 37 K.

2500|$|Until recently, {{the use of}} siphon-type cisterns was {{mandatory}} in the UK to avoid the potential waste of water by millions of leaking toilets with <b>flapper</b> <b>valves</b> but due to EU harmonisation the regulations have changed. These valves can sometimes {{be more difficult to}} operate than a [...] "flapper"-based flush valve because the lever requires more torque than a flapper-flush-valve system. This additional torque required at the tank lever {{is due to the fact}} that a user must forcefully lift a certain amount of water up into the siphon passageway in order to initiate the siphon action in the tank.|$|R
5000|$|When a toilet's handle is turned, a {{discharge}} {{mechanism is}} activated {{by means of}} a rod or chain. The mechanism may be a <b>flapper</b> <b>valve,</b> which is designed to sink more slowly than the water, which will exit to the toilet bowl below, so that the tank may empty. As the tank water level drops, the float descends and actuates the fill valve. Water is fed to the tank to replenish its supply, and a smaller flow is directed into the overflow tube to refill the bowl. Once the <b>flapper</b> <b>valve</b> closes, the water flow from the fill valve continues until the tank level again reaches the fill line.|$|E
50|$|A <b>flapper</b> <b>valve</b> {{creates the}} {{watertight}} seal {{in the tank}} that holds the water before and after a flush of a toilet.

The pipe that leads into the rear muffler is divided in two, with one pipe equipped with a <b>flapper</b> <b>valve.</b> The ECU - working with an actuator and cable - opens this valve when travelling at medium-to-high road speeds. This increases exhaust gas flow.|$|E

50|$|The {{diesel engines}} failed {{immediately}} as seawater flooded their air intakes. The machinist {{in the fifth}} compartment who discovered the flooding became confused by the complex array of valves, and did not shut the ventilation <b>flapper</b> <b>valve</b> quickly enough. By the time he located the correct handwheel, the valve spindle had been bent {{by the force of}} the flooding water. As the compartment filled, the boat's trim became uncontrollable.|$|E
50|$|Construction plans {{called for}} {{completion}} of a perimeter dike around the subject section of islands, with the dike carried inside of a shell midden to avoid flooding tropical vegetation found there. A pump house allowed flooding of the impoundment during the summer rainy season when mosquito breeding is most intense. <b>Flapper</b> <b>valve</b> gates at {{the north and south}} ends of the impoundment were installed to allow closure during flooding and opening during the dry season to allow water exchange with the lagoon.|$|E
50|$|Toward {{the end of}} the {{discharge}} process, the ballcock responds to the drop in water level and refills the tank. Should the float or valve fail and allow the water level to exceed the fill line, the water will pour into the overflow tube and out to the bowl (in the <b>flapper</b> <b>valve</b> type) or to an outside drain (in the siphon type). Although this does not stop the wastage of water, it avoids the flooding that would otherwise occur after a single-point valve failure.|$|E
50|$|At {{some point}} in 1786, work on the pole-boat {{mechanism}} was abandoned. For a better boiler, he tried a coil of forged iron pipe, which proved to be both much more efficient and much smaller and lighter. With a functioning steam engine, another problem arose. The single-cylinder pump would draw several gallons of water from beneath the boat and send it down a copper pipe to the stern. Because gallons of water were being drawn into the pump {{at the same time}} as water was still flowing from it to the stern, the pump was working against itself; several strong strokes and it bound up. This was resolved by replacing the copper pipe with a square wooden trunk with <b>flapper</b> <b>valves</b> in the bottom to allow water in from the river, to relieve the negative pressure at the pump.|$|R
5000|$|... 2. Valves {{to prevent}} cement {{backflow}} did not close. Weatherford’s Auto-Fill float collar, which includes two flapper-type check valves, was installed at Macondo 180 ft above the reamer shoe at casing bottom. The valves are held open by a 2-inch diameter auto-fill tube {{to allow the}} casing to fill with mud while it is lowered down the well. BP’s casing installation procedure stated: [...] "slowly increase (mud) pump rates greater than 8 bpm to convert the float equipment (~ 500 - 700 psi) per Weatherford recommendation". As the flow rate drag force during circulation and cementing was only around 30% of that required, the auto-fill tube was almost certainly not ejected and the <b>flapper</b> <b>valves</b> never closed. Some evidence suggests that personnel on the Deepwater Horizon mistakenly believed that the high pressure needed to establish mud circulation had converted the float collar.|$|R
50|$|The tip tanks provide {{additional}} fuel capacity to enable longer times aloft. A jet pump installed in each tip tank transfers fuel into the wing tanks.

50|$|Improvised {{methods of}} {{salvaging}} this heat for in-home heating, {{by use of}} inline vent boxes equipped with a <b>flapper</b> <b>valve</b> to redirect moist heated air to indoor areas, will also increase humidity within a dwelling. Although this may be beneficial in dry winter conditions, excess humidity from these devices increases likelihood of mold, mildew, and bacterial growth inside a home. Indoor venting may also be against local regulations. Gas dryers must always be vented outdoors, as the products of combustion are mixed with the moist air. Building codes and manufacturers' instructions usually recommended that dryers vent outdoors. An indoor lint trap kit poses a similar concern of increased humidity within the dwelling.|$|E
50|$|To start it, {{there was}} a flush {{submerged}} pull start handle in the top surface of the deck by the engine hatch. Air feed to the engine was controlled by a <b>flapper</b> <b>valve</b> vent forward on {{the nose of the}} board's top surface. It sucked air in, porting it to the stern (or rear) of the craft. It was constructed of a heavy marine grade aircraft aluminum alloy to withstand the saltwater conditions it would be used in. The hull was self-bailing via a venturi effect off the grated forward water feed port, {{on the bottom of the}} board, that exhausted through the jet drive nozzle to rear for propulsion. It required routine maintenance to keep a tiny vent hole clear of seaweed or debris or the engine compartment would flood easily.|$|E
5000|$|Some combat medical {{technicians}} {{make use}} of field dressing wrappers {{in the management of}} [...] "sucking" [...] chest wounds. In such wounds, the working of the chest sucks air through the wound into the space around the lung, rather than sucking air down the throat and into the lung. The hole must be sealed to enable the casualty to breathe properly. As a battlefield interim measure, the waterproof wrapper of a field dressing can be placed over the hole, with the clean inside against the wound, and taped in place. Tape is applied to the sides and top of the wrapper, leaving the bottom edge free. The wrapper then acts as a simple <b>flapper</b> <b>valve,</b> preventing air being sucked in but allowing any that has already entered to be forced out as the casualty exhales.|$|E

In this research, we firstly develop a pressure differentiator using an isothermal chamber, a cylindrical type laminar flow element and a differential pressure sensor.

The full Navier-Stokes code, INS 3 D, is modified to handle interior obstacles. Grids are generated by SVTGD 3 D code.

Important flow characteristics such as secondary flows, recirculation, vortex and wake regions, and separated flows are observed.

50|$|On the 32 and 320, {{the engine}} exhaust exits above the waterline, usually via a rubber flap valve, {{and with no}} marine {{silencer}} used in the system {{due to lack of}} space available. Partly in order to offer some degree of attenuation of the (noticeable) exhaust booming noise, a characteristic of Corvettes, the latest 340 models have specially built 90 degree GRP exhaust elbows fitted to allow the engine exhaust to exit under water. These elbows have a small by-pass outlet with a <b>flapper</b> <b>valve</b> to prevent back flow. Also, the shape of the underside section is designed to promote suction to ensure that back pressure is within limits. To accommodate the underwater exhaust outlet, the trim tabs had to be cut away locally. Also on the 340, a fixed cavitation plate was added on the centreline between the trim tabs, {{as an extension of the}} hull lower surface. This fixed “interceptor” type trim tab helped bring the bow down at speed to improve the running angle and trim.|$|E

The main objectives of the analysis were to predict and correlate the hydrodynamic stability of the flappers and pressure drop with available water test data. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) computer codes were procured at no cost from the public domain, and were modified and extended {{to carry out the}} disconnect flow analysis. The grid generator codes SVTGD 3 D and INGRID were obtained. NASA Ames Research Center supplied the flow solution code INS 3 D, and the color graphics code PLOT 3 D. A driver routine was developed to automate the grid generation process. Components such as pipes, elbows, and flappers can be generated with simple commands, and flapper angles can be varied easily. The flow solver INS 3 D code was modified to treat interior flappers, and other interfacing routines were developed, which include a turbulence model, a force/moment routine, a time-step routine, and initial and boundary conditions. In particular, an under-relaxation scheme was implemented to enhance the solution stability. Major physical assumptions and simplifications made in the analysis include the neglect of linkages, slightly reduced flapper diameter, and smooth solid surfaces. A grid size of 54 x 21 x 25 was employed for both the LO 2 and LH 2 units. Mixing length theory applied to turbulent shear flow in pipes formed the basis for the simple turbulence model.

50|$|A {{swing check}} valve or tilting disc check valve is a check valve in which the disc, the movable part to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening {{cross-section}} may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although {{swing check valve}}s can come in various sizes, large check valves are often swing check valves. The <b>flapper</b> <b>valve</b> in a flush-toilet mechanism {{is an example of}} this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by manual lift of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the clapper valve, used in applications such firefighting and fire life safety systems. A hinged gate only remains open in the inflowing direction. The clapper valve often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the backwater valve (for sanitary drainage system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in sanitary drainage systems connected to combined sewerage systems and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood.|$|E
40|$|Due to the environmental, {{energy saving}} and {{economic}} requirements, development {{of very high}} efficient compressors is of great importance. Consequently, <b>flapper</b> <b>valve</b> material becomes a critical issue and a limiting factor {{for the development of}} compressor. This paper provides a discussion on the material selection of the <b>flapper</b> <b>valve</b> for the compressors with very high efficiency, based mainly on a basic research on the mechanisms of impact fatigue and a FEM simulation on the formation of stress concentration in the <b>flapper</b> <b>valve</b> during the impact process. Impact fatigue initiation is caused by the initial impact stress, but the fatigue crack propagation is caused by a wavy stress propagation. This causes the formation of secondary cracks at the stress concentration points where two stress waves have the same phase. The results indicate that the <b>flapper</b> <b>valve</b> materials for the very high efficient compressors should have both high impact fatigue strength for the initial stress, and high stress damping capacity to reduce the crack propagation rate.
