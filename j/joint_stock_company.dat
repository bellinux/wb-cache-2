5|$|In January 1837, Smith {{and other}} church leaders created a <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>company,</b> called the Kirtland Safety Society, {{to act as}} a quasi-bank; the company issued bank notes {{capitalized}} in part by real estate. Smith encouraged the Latter Day Saints to buy the notes, and he invested heavily in them himself, but the bank failed within a month. As a result, the Latter Day Saints in Kirtland suffered intense pressure from debt collectors and severe price volatility. Smith was held responsible for the failure, and there were widespread defections from the church, including many of Smith's closest advisers. After a warrant was issued for Smith's arrest on a charge of banking fraud, Smith and Rigdon fled Kirtland for Missouri in January 1838.|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} thesis is to analyze the main theoretical aspects of the acquisition of own shares in <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> {{and the provision of}} financial assistance by limited liability <b>companies</b> and <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> in the Czech Republic. The thesis is divided into two main parts. The aim of such outline is to comprehensively describe two main legal mechanisms which are relevant to the scope of my thesis: (a) the acquisition of own shares in <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>companies,</b> and (b) the provision of financial assistance. Individual chapters examine in detail relevant legal aspects of both main parts. Chapter one of the first part focuses on inconsistency between Czech and other language versions of the Directive 2006 / 68 /EC. Chapter two deals with an amended version of the Czech Commercial Code in eight sub-chapters where the relevant legal provisions are addressed; it draws an attention to provisions where transposition was not done accurately and appropriately. Chapter three analyzes legal conditions related to the acquisition of own shares in <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> under the amended legislation.

The penetration by women of the private sphere of investment did not always extend to the more public sphere of participation at shareholder meetings.

The doctrine and the practice of courts agree that legal principles are also an important source of law. In law of <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>companies,</b> the functions of legal principles manifest themselves to a great extent. The general principles of private law, such as the principle of good morals, principles valid in whole business law, such as the principle of fair trade, principles of company law, principles valid only within the scope of law of <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>companies,</b> and also the very special principles of particular institutions in law of <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>companies,</b> manifest themselves in law of <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>companies.</b> The need to protect creditors against an abuse of legal form of a corporation by its shareholders is currently one of the most discussed issues of law of <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>companies.</b> A substantive part of this thesis is therefore dedicated to the protection of creditors.
