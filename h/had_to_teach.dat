5|$|Bohr did {{not enjoy}} {{teaching}} medical students. He {{decided to return to}} Manchester, where Rutherford had offered him a job as a reader in place of Darwin, whose tenure had expired. Bohr accepted. He took a leave of absence from the University of Copenhagen, which he started by taking a holiday in Tyrol with his brother Harald and aunt Hanna Adler. There, he visited the University of Göttingen and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he met Sommerfeld and conducted seminars on the trilogy. The First World War broke out while they were in Tyrol, greatly complicating the trip back to Denmark and Bohr's subsequent voyage with Margrethe to England, where he arrived in October 1914. They stayed until July 1916, by which time he had been appointed to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, a position created especially for him. His docentship was abolished at the same time, so he still <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> physics to medical students. New professors were formally introduced to King Christian X, who expressed his delight at meeting such a famous football player.|$|E
25|$|Christina was {{interested}} in theatre, especially the plays of Pierre Corneille; she was herself an amateur actress. In 1647 the Italian architect Antonio Brunati was ordered to build a theatrical setting {{in one of the}} larger rooms of the palace. The court poet Georg Stiernhielm wrote several plays in the Swedish language, such as Den fångne Cupido eller Laviancu de Diane, performed with Christina in {{the main part of the}} goddess Diana. She invited foreign companies to play at Bollhuset, such as an Italian opera troupe in 1652 with Vincenzo Albrici and a Dutch theater troupe with Ariana Nozeman and Susanna van Lee in 1653. Among the French artists she employed was Anne Chabanceau de La Barre, who was made court singer. From 1638 Oxenstierna employed a French ballet troupe under Antoine de Beaulieu, who also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> Christina to move around more elegantly.|$|E

Dahan was satisfied, because Farmer had a clear and deep voice and could easily reach high notes. Initial rehearsals were held at Dahan's home. Dahan has said of these rehearsals: [...] "There was a large room with a piano and there we repeated the staging of the song. Mylène {{had a hard time}} understanding all this, we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> her everything, starting with the choreography [...] This probably did not look very professional." ...|$|E

500|$|Massey {{returned}} to University College, London, in October 1945 {{to find it}} badly damaged by bombing, and the Mathematics Department in dingy temporary accommodation. He was allowed to pick his own lecturers, so he chose Bats, Burhop, Buckingham and Gunn. While they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> mathematics, they were free {{to choose their own}} research topics, so they chose to research physics, carrying out physical experiments. This situation lasted until 1950, when Edward Andrade retired, and Massey was appointed Quain Professor of Physics and head of the University College, London, Physics Department. The department was merged with Astronomy in 1973, but he remained its head [...] until he retired in 1975. He also served as University College, London's Vice-Provost from 1969 to 1973.|$|E

She had an interview scheduled with the college's dean, but he sent {{his wife and his}} teenage daughter to conduct it. She accepted the Berkeley job, which was in the Department of Home Economics. The position paid $1,800; male faculty members at the university were paid $2,400 with a doctorate and $1,800 without one. When Morgan arrived at Berkeley, she found that she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> courses in nutrition and dietetics.

500|$|McClymont's work {{experiences}} {{caused him}} to feel disastified {{with the quality of}} education he had received in his degree program at Sydney. [...] He felt the veterinary science specialization was too narrow, especially in the area of animal husbandry and livestock production. [...] Moreover, he felt the specialization of the discipline did not provide sufficient knowledge in how the overall farm animal production process worked. [...] For example, as an undergraduate, he received only three lectures on statistics, a skill he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> himself during his first few years as an animal nutritionist advisor. [...] As a result, he took an interest in education and curriculum development. [...] McClymont later said that he had [...] "seen the educational deficiencies of narrow specialization, whether of veterinary graduates as specialists in animal health and disease or of agricultural science graduates as specialists in aspects of soil and plants. [...] I had seen the problems created by such specialized knowledge when exercised without overall understanding." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time in any of his works {{involving}} amateurs, Britten envisaged a large complement of child performers among his orchestral forces, led by what Graham described as [...] "the professional stiffening" [...] of a piano duet, string quintet (two violins, viola, cello and bass), recorder and a timpanist. The young musicians play a variety of instruments, including a full string ensemble with each section led {{by a member of the}} professional string quintet. The violins are further divided into parts of different levels of difficulty, from the simplest (mostly playing open strings) to those able to play in third position. The recorders should be led by an accomplished soloist able to flutter-tongue; bugles, played in the original production by boys from a local school band, are played as the children representing animals march into the ark, and at the climax of the opera. The child percussionists, led by a professional timpanist, play various exotic and invented percussion instruments: the score itself specifies sandpaper ("two pieces of sandpaper attached to blocks of wood and rubbed together"), and [...] "Slung Mugs", the latter used to represent the first drops of rain. Britten originally had the idea of striking teacups with a spoon, but having failed to make this work, he sought Imogen Holst's advice. She recalled that [...] "by great good fortune I had once <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> Women's Institute percussion groups during a wartime 'social half hour', so I was able to take him into my kitchen and show him how a row of china mugs hanging on a length of string could be hit with a large wooden spoon.|$|E

2500|$|Harris also directs and edits {{many of the}} band's live videos, {{beginning}} with Maiden England in 1989. Although not intending to himself, Harris edited the Rock in Rio DVD as he was unsatisfied with the results produced by the band's hired production crew. In undertaking the project, Harris <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> himself how to use digital editing software with equipment he had installed in Barnyard Studios, {{and went on to}} edit Iron Maiden's next DVD, Death on the Road.

He had extensive wilderness survival skills before he joined the show, has a photographic memory, and a high-level intelligence.

2500|$|Given {{that the}} band's {{background}} was exclusively in heavy music at that point, some band members experienced difficulties expanding their sound early on. In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> {{him to play}} the ska stroke for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, [...] "Oh, what I remember was... this was our first... like, we had only done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so this was our first time trying to ever play ska. And I'd never played... on guitar, like, I'd never played... I didn't {{know how to do}} that skanking guitar shit at all. But Patton could do, like with one finger on the thread mark, he could do the, the rhythmic part of it pretty well. Like, he could... he taught me how to do it. So, I just sort of awkwardly... I would fill in and make the chord and he actually played guitar, but would just kind of use it percussively. And we played these Camper Van Beethoven songs, and I don't... I dunno if we played The Specials, but that's what we were listening to." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the older}} Protestant nobility having been either killed or expelled, the new Moravian nobility were keen to expand the range of areas taught beyond just {{theology}} and philosophy. Despite opposition from the Jesuits, the Emperor Leopold I authorized the introduction of legal studies in 1679. A vigorous power struggle between the Jesuits and secular legal professors ensued. Several interventions by Emperors were {{needed to keep the}} legal studies going during the following decades. Karel Ferdinand Irmler started to lecture in both canonical and secular law at the university. However, the quarrels with the Rector became so intense that the nobility requested him to teach only secular law. Consequently, he was forbidden to give lectures at the university and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> in his home, while later professors gave law lectures in the building of Olomouc court. In 1725 the nobility forced the establishment of the [...] – the Academy of Nobility – by the decree of Emperor Charles VI. By this time the Emperor had compelled the Jesuits to accept without obstruction the study of secular law at the university. The law professors were lecturing at both the university and the academy (where in addition to law, economics, mathematics, geometry, history and geography along with architecture – both civil and military – were also now available). The academy remained in Olomouc until 1847, when it was relocated to Brno: here it became the basis for what was later to become the Brno University of Technology.|$|E
