5|$|On 2 August 1990, British Airways Flight 149 {{landed at}} Kuwait International Airport four {{hours after the}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait. The aircraft, a Boeing 747-100 G-AWND, was destroyed, and all {{passengers}} and crew were captured. Two of the landing gears were salvaged, and are on display in Waterside, BA Headquarters in London.|$|E
5|$|No {{military}} operations {{were conducted by}} NATO during the Cold War. Following {{the end of the}} Cold War, the first operations, Anchor Guard in 1990 and Ace Guard in 1991, were prompted by the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait. Airborne early warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of southeastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.|$|E
5|$|RAF Uxbridge {{also became}} {{involved}} in Operation Granby following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Invasion</b> of Kuwait in August 1990. Personnel at Uxbridge were prepared for service in the Gulf at that time, and deployed that year in December. During the aerial assault on Iraq in January 1991, support group meetings began at the station {{for the families of}} service personnel serving during the Gulf War. Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, visited one of these groups in February 1991.|$|E
50|$|The Armenian {{population}} {{reached its}} peak of 12,000. But after the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasions,</b> the numbers of the Armenians resident in Kuwait greatly diminished to just 500 {{as they left the}} country.|$|R
50|$|The Armenians in Kuwait {{are people}} of Armenian descent living in Kuwait. As of 2013, {{there has been}} a large {{population}} increase and now the Armenians number 6,000. Before the Gulf War, the Armenian population reached its peak of 12,000. But after the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasions,</b> the numbers of the Armenians resident in Kuwait greatly diminished to just 500 as they left the country.|$|R
50|$|The Seabird Seeker has {{had some}} export success, and is {{operated}} by the new (post 2003 <b>invasion)</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Air Force.|$|R
5|$|The brigade {{was called}} to support the {{multinational}} response to the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. The brigade grew to a 7,700 soldier force composed of three groups, ten battalions, four separate companies, and eight detachments in support of XVIII Airborne Corps during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The brigade completed 1,500 combat heavy battalions equivalent days of work constructing roads, airfields, heliports, ammunition/fuel/water storage points, life support areas and forward landing strips, distributed over ten million maps, trained over 5,000 coalition engineers, and supported the French attack on Assalman airfield. During follow-on missions the brigade destroyed over 6,000 enemy bunkers and one million tons of munitions.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait in August 1990, No.86 Wing {{prepared}} to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia {{in the event}} that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, {{the fleet}} was {{regularly}} involved in crises; to deter an <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait in 1962, in Tanganyika in 1964, and in Indonesia from 1964 to 1966. The Beira Patrol blocking oil supplies to Rhodesia began in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Cultural sensitivity. Counter-insurgent forces require {{familiarity}} with the local culture, mores and language or they will experience numerous difficulties. Americans experienced this in Vietnam and during the US <b>Iraqi</b> Freedom <b>invasion</b> and occupation, where shortages of Arabic speaking interpreters and translators hindered both civil and military operations.|$|R
50|$|According to the Pentagon, 250000 ST (of 650000 ST total) of {{ordnance}} was looted, {{providing a}} {{significant source of}} ammunition for the <b>Iraqi</b> insurgency. The <b>invasion</b> phase concluded when Tikrit, Saddam's home town, fell with little resistance to the U.S. Marines of Task Force Tripoli.|$|R
50|$|Though the <b>Iraqi</b> air <b>invasion</b> {{surprised}} the Iranians, the Iranian air force retaliated with {{an attack against}} Iraqi military bases and infrastructure in Operation Kaman 99 (Bow 99). Groups of F-4 Phantom and F-5 Tiger fighter jets attacked targets throughout Iraq, such as oil facilities, dams, petrochemical plants, and oil refineries, and included Mosul Airbase, Baghdad, and the Kirkuk oil refinery. Iraq was taken by surprise at {{the strength of the}} retaliation, as Iran took few losses while the Iraqis took heavy defeats and economic disruption.|$|R
25|$|Following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia {{joined the}} anti-Iraq Coalition. King Fahd, fearing an attack from Iraq, invited American and Coalition {{soldiers}} to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. Saudi troops and aircraft {{took part in}} the subsequent military operations.|$|E
25|$|As of 1983 {{the branch}} {{was led by}} Faisal al-Sani. The Kuwaiti Ba'ath Party branch {{collapsed}} during Gulf War because of the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait. Saleh al-Mutlaq, {{the leader of the}} Iraqi National Dialogue Front, has been accused of trying to rebuild the party.|$|E
25|$|Less than a {{year after}} the 37th TFW saw combat in Panama, in {{response}} to the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait on 2 August 1990, the 415th TFS of the 37th TFW was deployed to King Khalid International Airport, Saudi Arabia on 19 August to provide air defense over the Saudi capital of Riyadh.|$|E
5000|$|After the defeat, Saddam and the Baath Party held an [...] "Extraordinary Congress" [...] {{and decided}} on a full {{mobilization}} of the Iraqi Popular Army. [...] Enlisting men as old as 42, the regime initiated a total call-up of available manpower in 1986. At the time the government feared that calls for the mobilization would lead to draft riots, but the response was good: young men - even college students - reported without incident. The fact that the public answered the call, indicated that <b>Iraqis</b> feared <b>invasion</b> during the war.|$|R
5000|$|Before the 2003 <b>invasion,</b> <b>Iraqi</b> {{crude oil}} {{production}} was about [...] (BPD). In 2006 Iraqi crude oil production averaged 2.12 million BPD. [...] In mid-2006, the Iraqi oil minister, said that [...] "he expected output {{to rise to}} approximately 4 m BPD by 2010, increasing to 6 m BPD by 2012." ...|$|R
5000|$|Political themes {{have often}} {{served as an}} {{inspirational}} source for Janson, and {{he is one of}} the few Norwegian composers who have had a demonstration held against a performance of one of his works, Interlude for orchestra og accordeon, a work written as a salute to Arne Treholt, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for espionage for the Soviet Union in a trial in 1985. In the more humorous-political genre, Valse Triste marks a milestone - and is viewed as a critical collage of early 70s Norwegian cultural debate. More recent works with a clear political trait includes 2003’s A Bagdad Blues (not for Blair, not for Bush) [...] which Janson wrote in protest against the Operation <b>Iraqi</b> Freedom <b>invasion</b> of Iraq.|$|R
25|$|In addition, Kuwait {{had been}} {{producing}} oil above treaty limits established by OPEC. By {{the eve of}} the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion,</b> Kuwait had set production quotas to almost , which coincided with a sharp drop in the price of oil. By the summer of 1990, Kuwaiti overproduction had become a serious point of contention with Iraq.|$|E
25|$|One of Brandt's last public {{appearances}} was in flying to Baghdad, Iraq, to free Western hostages held by Saddam Hussein, following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait in 1990. Brandt secured {{the release of}} a large number of them, and on 9 November 1990, his airplane landed with 174 freed hostages on board at the Frankfurt Airport.|$|E
25|$|Nance recounts {{lessons learned}} from the Lebanon war with Israel in 1992, {{particularly}} how the subsequent occupation of Lebanon by Israel could have provided the U.S with significant ways to improve their strategy in the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> in 2003. Nance compares and contrasts the two occupation force strategies, and argues each left their occupiers with many deaths and few tangible results.|$|E
50|$|Abdul Rahman Yasin, {{a suspect}} {{detained}} {{shortly after the}} 1993 US World Trade Center Bombing attacks, fled upon release into Iraq. Shortly after release, the FBI had discovered evidence linking him {{to the creation of}} the bomb. After the <b>invasion,</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government official documents translated from Arabic to English described Saddam's regime provided monthly payments to Yasin while in residing in the United States. Yasin is on the FBI's most wanted terrorists list, and is still at large.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} {{tried to}} integrate the Shias into the war effort by recruiting many {{as part of the}} Ba'ath Party. In an attempt to counterbalance the religious fervor of the Iranians and gain support from the devout masses, the regime also began to promote religion and, on the surface, Islamization, despite the fact that Iraq was run by a secular regime. Scenes of Saddam praying and making pilgrimages to shrines became common on state-run television. While Iraqi morale had been low throughout the war, the attack on al-Faw raised patriotic fervor, as the <b>Iraqis</b> feared <b>invasion.</b> Saddam also recruited volunteers from other Arab countries into the Republican Guard, and received much technical support from foreign nations as well. While Iraqi military power had been depleted in recent battles, through heavy foreign purchases and support, they were able to expand their military even to much larger proportions by 1988.|$|R
5000|$|The war is {{also known}} under other names, such as the Persian Gulf War, First Gulf War, Gulf War I, Kuwait War, or the First Iraq War, before the term [...] "Iraq War" [...] became {{identified}} instead with the 2003 Iraq War (also {{referred to in the}} U.S. as [...] "Operation <b>Iraqi</b> Freedom").Kuwait's <b>invasion</b> by <b>Iraqi</b> troops that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation, and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the U.N. Security Council. U.S. President George H. W. Bush deployed U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia, and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. An array of nations joined the Coalition, the biggest coalition since World War II. The great majority of the Coalition's military forces were from the U.S., with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order. Saudi Arabia paid around US$36 billion of the US$60 billion cost.|$|R
25|$|Khuzestan is ethnically diverse, {{home to many}} {{different}} ethnic groups. This has a bearing on Khuzestan's electoral politics, with ethnic minority rights playing {{a significant role in}} the province's political culture. The province's geographical location bordering Iraq and its oil resources also make it a politically sensitive region, particularly given its history of foreign intervention, notably the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of 1980.|$|E
25|$|Following the Soviet Union's {{withdrawal}} from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait in August 1990 {{had put the}} Kingdom and its ruling House of Saud at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were within easy striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.|$|E
25|$|On 21 January 2002 Solana {{said that}} the detainees at Guantanamo Bay {{should be treated as}} prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention. The EU has stated that it hopes to avoid another war like the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> through this and future negotiations, and Solana has said the most {{difficult}} moments of his job were when the United Kingdom and France, the two permanent EU Security Council members, were in disagreement.|$|E
50|$|The Hawke Government {{committed}} Australian {{naval forces}} to the 1991 Gulf War {{in support of the}} United States led coalition against the Saddam Hussein <b>Iraqi</b> regime's <b>invasion</b> of neighbouring Kuwait. Following the end of the Cold War, the 1990s was a busy period for United Nations peacekeeping missions, and the Keating Government committed Australian forces to various theatres: at one point during 1993, Australia had some 3000 peacekeepers committed to the field, including a large number in Cambodia and Somalia. Foreign Minister Gareth Evans had taken {{a leading role in the}} organisation of a peace settlement for Cambodia in the aftermath of the genocidal regime of Pol Pot and Australia contributed the force commander. While the United Nations intervention in Cambodia was largely successful, the Somali intervention ended poorly. The following year, the Rwandan Genocide commenced in Central Africa, and, following the Somali experience, the international community was this time slow to intervene. The Keating Government despatched medical staff to aid in the belated UN Mission to that nation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an exploratory {{study of a}} selection of user contributions to a news feedback forum on the Web provided by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) World Service to its Arab listeners. Contributions representing Iraqi public opinion {{on a variety of}} topics covering Iraq under occupation were categorized and analyzed to provide a glimpse of how access to the Web has allowed Iraqis to freely express their opinions, and of how Iraqi public opinion manifests itself throughout these contributions. The results provided insights into the feelings of <b>Iraqis</b> towards the <b>invasion</b> and occupation of their country, and they highlighted the role played by the Web as a vital communication vehicle for public opinion and political debates...|$|R
50|$|Roughly 40% of Iraq's {{middle class}} is {{believed}} to have fled, the U.N. said. Most are fleeing systematic persecution and have no desire to return. All kinds of people, from university professors to bakers, have been targeted by militias, insurgents and criminals. An estimated 331 school teachers were slain in the first four months of 2006, according to Human Rights Watch, and at least 2,000 Iraqi doctors have been killed and 250 kidnapped since the 2003 U.S. <b>invasion.</b> <b>Iraqi</b> refugees in Syria and Jordan live in impoverished communities with little international attentionto their plight and little legal protection. In Syria alone an estimated 50,000 Iraqi girls and women, many of them widows, are forced into prostitution just to survive.|$|R
25|$|On November 4, 1990, the 4th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery was {{deployed}} to defend Saudi Arabia from <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> {{as part of}} Operation Desert Shield in late December 1990. When the defense of Saudi Arabia mission {{gave way to the}} liberation of Kuwait, 4-27 FA provided extensive fire support for the 1st Armored Division. During the ensuing 96 hours of Operation Desert Storm, the battalion unleashed major bombardments with their 27 M270 MLRS launchers against Iraqi forces.|$|E
25|$|During the Iran–Iraq War, Khuzestan was {{the focus}} of the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Iran, leading to the flight of {{thousands}} of the province's residents. As a result, Khuzestan suffered the heaviest damage of all Iranian provinces during the war. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein felt confident that the Arab population of the Khuzestan would react enthusiastically to the prospect of union with Iraq. However, resistance to the invasion was fierce, stalling the Iraqi military's advance, and ultimately opening a window of opportunity for an Iranian counter-offensive.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle East, {{faced by}} the 1958 {{collapse}} of the Baghdad Pact {{and the spread of}} Soviet influence, Macmillan acted decisively to restore the confidence of Persian Gulf allies, using the Royal Air Force and special forces to defeat a revolt backed by Saudi Arabia and Egypt against the Sultan of Oman, Said bin Taimur, in July 1957; deploying airborne battalions to defend Jordan against Syrian subversion in July 1958,; and deterring a threatened <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> of Kuwait by landing a brigade group in July 1960.|$|E

25|$|The {{invasion}} was swift, {{leading to}} the collapse of the Iraqi government and the military of Iraq in about three weeks. The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly seized and secured with limited damage in that time. Securing the oil infrastructure was considered of great importance. In the Gulf War, while retreating from Kuwait, the Iraqi army had set many oil wells on fire in an attempt to disguise troop movements and to distract Coalition forces. Before the 2003 <b>invasion,</b> <b>Iraqi</b> forces had mined some 400 oil wells around Basra and the Al-Faw peninsula with explosives. Coalition troops launched an air and amphibious assault on the Al-Faw peninsula during the closing hours of 19 March to secure the oil fields there; the amphibious assault was supported by warships of the Royal Navy, Polish Navy, and Royal Australian Navy.|$|R
50|$|The Iraqi Christian {{population}} is also declining due to lower birth rates and higher death rates than their Muslim compatriots. Since the 2003 <b>invasion,</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Christians suffer {{from lack of}} security. Many lived in the capital Baghdad and in Mosul prior to the Iraq war, but most have since fled to northern Iraq, where Assyrian Christians form a majority in some districts. Assyrian Christians belong to Syriac churches such as the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, the Syriac Catholic Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church, with {{a small number of}} Protestant converts following the Assyrian Pentecostal Church and Assyrian Evangelical Church. The Iraqi former foreign minister and deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz (real name Michael Youkhanna) is probably the most famous Assyrian Iraqi Christian, along with the footballer Ammo Baba. Assyrians in Iraq have traditionally excelled in business, sports, the arts, music, and the military.|$|R
