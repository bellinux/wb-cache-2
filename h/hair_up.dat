And, literally, every take became a more and more {{confident}} take, so that she could have fun with what was going on. Not being over-the-top sarcastic, but ... having a laugh at everything that was going on around her, with confidence. [...] The very last dance of the piece, she had her <b>hair</b> <b>up,</b> and I go, 'Can you just do one for me with your hair down?' She dropped her hair down. You'll see we intercut with her <b>hair</b> <b>up</b> and her hair down. That was the last piece. She just rocked it from her heart. She choreographed that last dance at the very end. She did that on her own and said, 'Let's go for it'".|$|E
500|$|In {{the centre}} poses Tomimoto Toyohina, a famed geisha of the Tamamuraya {{house in the}} Yoshiwara {{pleasure}} district. [...] She was dubbed [...] "Tomimoto" [...] having made her name playing Tomimoto-bushi music on the shamisen. [...] Like the other two models, she has her <b>hair</b> <b>up</b> in the fashionable Shimada style that was popular at the time. [...] Contrasted with the homelier teahouse-girl garments {{of the other two}} models, she is dressed in the showier geisha style. [...] The Tomimoto crest's Japanese primrose design adorns the sleeve of her kimono. [...] Toyohina's birthdate is unknown.|$|E
500|$|It was fashionable {{for women}} to be full-figured (or plump). Men enjoyed the {{presence}} of assertive, active women. The foreign horse-riding sport of polo from Persia became a wildly popular trend amongst the Chinese elite, and women often played the sport (as glazed earthenware figurines from the time period portray). The preferred hairstyle for women was to bunch their <b>hair</b> <b>up</b> like [...] "an elaborate edifice above the forehead", while affluent ladies wore extravagant head ornaments, combs, pearl necklaces, face powders, and perfumes. A law was passed in 671 which attempted to force women to wear hats with veils again {{in order to promote}} decency, but these laws were ignored as some women started wearing caps and even no hats at all, as well as men's riding clothes and boots, and tight-sleeved bodices.|$|E

500|$|Two heroines were {{subsequently}} added to To Heart 2 story in later {{versions of the}} game. Sasara Kusugawa becomes the student council president of Takaaki's school during his second year. She inherits her position from the previous president Ma-ryan, as {{she is the only}} remaining student council member after the latter's graduation. Sasara is very diligent, often completing all of the student council's tasks by herself. She is often feared by students for her strict attitude, but is actually disguising a shy and gentle personality. [...] Mio Hanesaki is Takaaki's classmate. She remains largely unnoticed by other students, most of whom remain oblivious of her name. She originally ties her <b>hair</b> <b>up</b> and wears eyeglasses, but later wears contact lens and her hair untied as an attempt by Takaaki to change the impression she gives to others.|$|E

Then, it cuts to her holding her <b>hair</b> <b>up</b> and singing the first lines {{in front of}} a white background. There are also black and white scenes of her wearing a white leotard behind a foggy glass. She then appears wearing the leotard and glasses, while surrounded by four female dancers wearing black outfits, hanging from a raised [...] The word [...] "sin" [...] is censored and changed for the word [...] "this" [...] during the pre-chorus.

At the bridge, there are intercut close-ups of her that end with a smirk. The video concludes with Spears dancing with the two male dancers and cuts to a close-up of her looking into the camera.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for an actor who could portray Silver as a [...] "quirky kid who moves to her own beat". Sachs explained that Jessica Stroup [...] "came in dressed for the part, artsy and quirky, and she had her <b>hair</b> <b>up</b> {{and she had a}} bandana. She nailed it." [...] The producers were fans of Tristan Wilds for his acting on The Wire, and hoped to hire him as Dixon from the start of casting. When asked about Michael Steger, who portrays Navid, Sachs said [...] "he's just great". Rob Estes, the last actor to join the series, was a previous cast member of the first Beverly Hills, 90210 spin-off, Melrose Place. Estes was sought by The CW to play Harry, but was contracted on the drama Women's Murder Club. When that series was canceled, Sachs called Estes and explained the spin-off to him, and {{he thought it was a}} great idea. Sachs promised that although he was playing a parent, he would not [...] "be furniture... as in the seldom seen or heard parents who populate many youth-centric series, like the Walsh parents on the original 90210." ...|$|E

This covering consists of tufted <b>hairs</b> <b>up</b> to 0.05 mm long and simple <b>hairs</b> typically <b>up</b> to 0.8 mm long (those of the tendril, midrib, lid and spur are denser and longer, reaching 2 mm). However, the indumentum is variable {{and may be}} reduced {{to the point of}} being completely inconspicuous in some populations.|$|R
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Early Winter" [...] {{was directed by}} Stefani's frequent collaborator Sophie Muller, who had previously directed the music videos of [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Wind It Up". Filming of the music video took place at destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague, where Stefani had been touring during The Sweet Escape Tour in October 2007. It opens with a black-and-white scene of Stefani {{lying on the ground}} in a long white gown. In the next scene, Stefani is shown walking on the street under red street lights and then holds her love interest, played by her tour backup dancer Steelo Vazquez, against the wall and talks to him. The scene then changes to Stefani walking on a street and later walking into the railway station. In the next scene, Stefani is seen singing under falling red-coloured feathers in a huge palace-type hall. Scenes of Stefani staring {{at herself in the mirror}} with her <b>hair</b> <b>up</b> and snow falling slowly down, with the lights turning on and off intermittently, are interspersed throughout the video. Stefani is also seen sitting on the ground and singing while crying. She is then shown at a railway station walking besides a moving train. The video ends with Stefani running out of the hall. Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy praised the video for being [...] "acutely artful, immeasurably stylish" [...] and commented that [...] "Gwenâ€™s managed to raise the bar on her own superlatively supreme style in her new video." ...|$|E

2500|$|Men's {{hair was}} {{generally}} short and neat {{until the late}} Empire, and often is shown elegantly curled, probably artificially (picture at top). The 9th century Khludov Psalter has Iconophile illuminations which vilify the last Iconoclast Patriarch, John the Grammarian, caricaturing him with untidy hair sticking straight out in all directions. Monk's hair was long, and most clergy had beards, as did many lay men, especially later. Upper-class women mostly wore their <b>hair</b> <b>up,</b> again very often curled and elaborately shaped. [...] If we are to judge by religious art, and the few depictions of other women outside the court, women probably kept their hair covered in public, especially when married.|$|E

5000|$|Minor {{differences}} {{have also been}} noted in {{the extent of the}} indumentum. Much like the type specimen, plants at the new locality bear brownish <b>hairs</b> <b>up</b> to 0.5 mm long on developing pitchers. However, they deviate from the type specimen in that these hairs persist conspicuously on mature lower pitchers and their tendrils. The plants are otherwise glabrous.|$|R

"Wars or Hands of Time", {{written by}} Bower, {{is the first}} Australian pop song to {{directly}} {{address the issue of}} the Vietnam War, which was now affecting the lives of many young Australians because of the controversial introduction of conscription in 1965. 20-year-old Keays was one of hundreds of potential conscripts whose birthday (9 September) was picked in a 1966 ballot. He was able to legally avoid the draft by signing with the Citizens Military Force (CMF, later renamed the Army Reserve) and eluded a [...] "short back and sides" [...] haircut with the aid of his girlfriend, who pinned his long <b>hair</b> <b>up</b> under his slouch hat whenever he attended CMF sessions.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1770s extreme hairstyles and wigs {{had come}} into fashion. Women wore their hair high upon their heads, in large plumes. To create tall extreme hair, rolls of horse hair, tow, or wool was used to raise up {{the front of the}} hair. The front of the hair was then frizzed out, or {{arranged}} in roll curls and set horizontally on the head. Women turned their <b>hair</b> <b>up</b> in the back often in a knot. [...] In addition, pomatum and false hair was used to give more height to the hair. Pomatum was paste that women used to stiffen their hair. Pomatum was also used to hold powder, which women put in their hair. The Pomatum was made of many ingredients including hog's grease, tallow, or a mix of beef marrow and oil.|$|E
2500|$|Buck denied these claims, testifying that Lambert had {{actively}} {{participated in}} the murder {{and that she had}} told Buck to [...] "wear her <b>hair</b> <b>up</b> and not to wear make-up or fingernail polish". Yunkin was later brought to the stand and the sweatpants that had been re-introduced in the 1997 trial as belonging to him were produced. Yunkin was ordered to hold the sweatpants up against his body, which were shown to be too short for him and of a different fabric than the pair shown in the 1992 trial. Further evidence and testimony was brought against Lambert such as a relative of Yunkin providing a poem that Lambert had written in jail that described the murder. Crime scene experts also testified that no evidence of Show writing out any initials in her blood was found and that other evidence discovered at the crime scene did not corroborate with Lambert's story.|$|E

2500|$|Whilst {{a member}} of The Masters Apprentices, Keays was one of {{hundreds}} of potential national service conscripts whose 20th birthday, 9 September, was picked in a 1966 ballot.

By February 1967 the band had relocated to Melbourne. Late that year he began taking the illegal psychedelic drug, LSD. After Bower left the group in September 1967, because of a severe nervous breakdown, Keays became the de facto leader, while various line-up changes followed. Keays chose their [...] "velvet, satin and floral-print psychedelic gear", which they wore on stage and for photo shoots.|$|E
2500|$|Encouraged by her father, Bow {{continued}} to visit studio agencies asking for parts. [...] "But {{there was always}} something. I was too young, or too little, or too fat. Usually I was too fat." [...] Eventually, director Elmer Clifton needed a tomboy for his movie Down to the Sea in Ships, saw Bow in Motion Picture Classic magazine, and sent for her. In an attempt to overcome her youthful looks, Bow put her <b>hair</b> <b>up</b> and arrived in a dress she [...] "sneaked" [...] from her mother. Clifton said she was too old, but broke into laughter as the stammering Bow made him believe she was {{the girl in the}} magazine. Clifton decided to bring Bow with him and offered her $35 a week. Bow held out for $50 and Clifton agreed, but he could not say whether she would [...] "fit the part". Bow later learned that one of Brewsters' subeditors had urged Clifton to give her a chance.|$|E
2500|$|On June 25, 2009, American {{recording}} artist, Michael Jackson, {{died from}} cardiac arrest {{at the age}} of 50, later revealed to be from a drug intoxication of the anesthetic drug Propofol (also known as [...] "Diprivan"). Jackson was friends with musicians Chris Brown, Diddy, Boyz II Men and The Game. Aside from being friends with some of the musicians involved on the song, others involved had also respected and admired Jackson. According to The Game, prior to Jackson's death Jackson, Diddy and Eminem had tried to end the feuding and tension between rapper 50 Cent and The Game in 2005. The Game stated that in 2005, Jackson called him and offered to help end the feud, remembering [...] "I was on tour in Canada, sitting in my room, cutting my hair [...] I was messing my <b>hair</b> <b>up.</b> Then my road manager knocks on my door.

2500|$|Catherine also {{received}} Elisabeth VigÃ©e Le Brun (formerly court painter to Marie Antoinette) at her Tsarskoye Selo residence in St Petersburg, by {{whom she was}} painted shortly before her death. Madame VigÃ©e Le Brun vividly describes the empress in her memoirs: [...] "the sight of this famous woman so impressed me that I {{found it impossible to}} think of anything: I could only stare at her. Firstly I was very surprised at her small stature; I had imagined her to be very tall, as great as her fame. She was also very fat, but her face was still beautiful, and she wore her white <b>hair</b> <b>up,</b> framing it perfectly. Her genius seemed to rest on her forehead, which was both high and wide. Her eyes were soft and sensitive, her nose quite Greek, her colour high and her features expressive. She addressed me immediately in a voice full of sweetness, if a little throaty: [...] "I am delighted to welcome you here, Madame, your reputation runs before you. I am very fond of the arts, especially painting. I am no connoisseur, but I am a great art lover." ...|$|E

It's one of those things where, hopefully, the audience will suspend disbelief a little bit." [...] The controversy was poorly received by critics as well. Film critic Roger Ebert was one of the critical voices against the casting. When asked about casting a white cast to portray the characters, he said, [...] "The original series Avatar: The Last Airbender was highly regarded and popular for three seasons on Nickelodeon. Its fans take it for granted that its heroes are Asian. Why would Paramount and Shyamalan go out of their way to offend these fans? There are many young Asian actors capable of playing the parts." [...] Jevon Phillips of the Los Angeles Times noted that despite Shyamalan's attempts to defuse the situation, [...] "this is definitely not an issue that will fade away or be overlooked" [...] and that this film exemplifies the need for a debate within Hollywood about racial diversity in its films.|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, {{during the}} casting period in 1984, Taylforth auditioned {{for the role}} of Sue Osman. She was {{unsuccessful}} and that part went to Sandy Ratcliff, however, Holland and Smith asked her back to audition for another role, the part of Kathy. Smith and Holland have commented that [...] "she came into the room, bringing the whole of the 'East-end' in with her [...] In exactly half a minute she'd charmed the pants off them". She was considered perfect, apart from her age. Smith and Holland have commented in their book Inside Story that [...] " [...] was too young! They had said so from the beginning. By rights, they should not even be interviewing her. But wasn't she perfect, apart from her age? So different from any other 'Kathy' they had seen. Fresher. More down to earth. Ages were discussed and a pocket-calculator produced. If Pete Beale had been her first boyfriend, wasn't it just possible that she could have a fourteen-year-old son? Julia and Tony were trying to talk themselves into it." [...] Taylforth has commented on the audition process, [...] " [...] whipped out a calculator and kept punching in numbers. 'We're trying to work out if you could be old enough to be Ian's Mum,' they said. I said, 'I can look older. I'll put my <b>hair</b> <b>up.</b> I'll have a few late nights and I promise I'll look old enough to be Ian's Mum'."
