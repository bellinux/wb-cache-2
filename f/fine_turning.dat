40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper {{is focused on the}} surface roughness variation in high speed <b>fine</b> <b>turning</b> of the austenitic stainless steel. Design/methodology/approach: A series of experimental tests have been done to evaluate the possibility of high speed <b>fine</b> <b>turning</b> of the austenitic stainless steel from the surface roughness variation and machining stability. Findings: It was found that, the smaller the feed rate, the smaller the surface roughness value. But when the feed rate smaller than the critical feed rate, the chatter will occurs and the surface roughness of the work piece would be deteriorated. The higher the cutting speed is, the higher the cutting temperature of cutting tool is. The cutting tool will be soften and the surface roughness of the workpiece will be deteriorated. Research limitations/implications: The tool chattering would caused poor surface roughness in high speed <b>fine</b> <b>turning</b> for feed rate smaller than 0. 02 mm/rev. The chatter suppression method must be considered when high speed <b>fine</b> <b>turning</b> of austenitic stainless steel. Originality/value: Most of the stainless steel machining proceeds at low cutting speed because the austenitic stainless steel is a hard machining material. The research result of this paper indicated that high speed <b>fine</b> <b>turning</b> of austenitic stainless steel is possible...|$|E

40|$|The wide {{application}} of precise high-quality components made of advanced structural materials {{is directly related}} to the accelerating use of superhard materials and tools made of them. When machining with these tools, the optimal choice of cutting process parameters is important, as the requirements concerning the parts can often only be satisfied by cutting under extreme conditions (small chip cross-section, high cutting speed, special materials, new wear forms, etc.). Polycrystalline CBN tools are widely used for the <b>fine</b> <b>turning</b> of parts made of construction, stainless, heat-resistant, acid-resistant or even hardened (60 - 70 HRC) HS steels. The experimental T = T(v(c)) tool life curves are of "dromedary" type. The tool life maximum point moves up and down according to changes of depth of cut and feed-rate values. The reasons for polyextreme tool life curves and moving maximum tool-life points are discussed in the paper. A new general tool life Eq. is outlined which reflects the physical principles of cutting phenomena more completely and exactly. The suggested form describes the polyextreme structure of the tool life function, while the position of the extreme values (along the T- and v(c) -axis) depend on the cutting parameters...|$|E
40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR) is traditionally defined as a transcriptional regulator involved in adaptive xenobiotic response, however, emerging evidence supports physiological functions of AhR in normal cell development and immune response. The role of AhR in immunomodulation is multi-dimensional. On the one hand, activation of AhR by TCDD and other ligands leads to profound immunosuppression, potentially via skewed Th 1 /Th 2 cell balance toward Th 1 dominance, and boosted Treg cell differentiation. On the other hand, activation of AhR can also induce Th 17 cell polarization and increase the severity of autoimmune disease. In addition to T lymphocytes, the AhR also appears to {{play a vital role}} in B cell maturation, and regulates the activity of macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils following lipopolysaccharide challenge or influenza virus infection. In these scenarios, activation of AhR is associated with decreased host response and reduced survival. Furthermore, gene knock out studies suggest that AhR is indispensable for the postnatal maintenance of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes and skin-resident dendritic epidermal gamma delta T cells, providing a potential link between AhR and gut immunity and wound healing. It is well accepted that the magnitude and the type of immune response is dependent on the local cytokine milieu and the AhR appears to be one of the key factors involved in the <b>fine</b> <b>turning</b> of this cytokine balance.

40|$|Technetium- 99 m ([superscript 99 m]Tc) is {{the most}} useful {{radioisotope}} in medical imaging due to its favourable nuclear characteristics, wide availability and low cost. Since [superscript 99 m]Tc is a metal, it must be chelated using appropriate ligands to impart affinity for target tissues. A series of new 2 -pyrrolylthiones were synthesised as potential ligands for transition metals, particularly [superscript 99 m]Tc, and were fully characterised. Both lipophilic and water-soluble compounds were obtained. Chemical reactions of the 2 -pyrrolylthiones were studied. It was found that {{physical and chemical properties}} of these ligands are highly dependent on the substituents in the outer periphery of the molecule. Transition metals such as Ni, Cu, Co, Cd, and Zn react smoothly with synthesised 2 -pyrrolylthiones. A general complexation procedure was developed for technetium and rhenium. [superscript 99 m]Tc and non-radioactive Re complexes were used to establish the chemical structure of the new [supescript 99 m]Tc compounds and to study their properties. Labelling of the 2 -pyrrolylthiones with [superscript 99 m]Tc was performed. The biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of the selected complexes were studied. The biodistribution pattern of the new [superscript 99 m]Tc-complexes greatly depends on their lipophilicity. Chemical changes in the ligand periphery, from highly lipophilic through amphiphilic to water-soluble, allow for <b>fine</b> <b>turning</b> of the biological properties of the corresponding technetium complexes. Novel 2 -pyrrolylthiones would provide a new class of radiopharmaceuticals for medical imaging, where the periphery of the radiopharmaceutical can be modified according to desirable properties, while the central technetium core remains the same...|$|E

40|$|Availability of high {{resolution}} population distribution data, {{independent of the}} administrative units in which demographic statistics are collected, is a real necessity in many fields: risk evaluation due to earthquakes, flooding or fires, {{to name just a}} few, integration between socio-demographic and environmental or geographical information collected in different formats, policy design for the provision public services, such as health, education or public transport, or mobility studies in urban areas or metropolitan regions. Because of this, the literature has explored various methods of population downscaling, collected at communality or census tract level, into smaller areas; typically urban polygons from {{high resolution}} topographic maps or land use/land cover databases, or grid cells, allowing the elaboration of raster population layers. A common feature of all these methods is that they do not incorporate building height. In this way, downscaling methods don´t distinguish between the urban sprawl type of settlement, where most of the houses are detached or semi-detached, and compact cities with high buildings. This paper examines error reduction in downscaling census tract population into 1 × 1 km and 1 ha grids, when we add the third dimension, building height from LIDAR remote sensing data. Algorithms used are simple, and based on areal weighting with or without auxiliary land use/land cover information, since our focus is not in <b>fine</b> <b>turning</b> algorithms, but in measuring improvements due to the missing dimension: building height. Our results indicate that improvements are noticeable. They are comparable to the ones obtained when we move from binary dasymetric methods to more general models combining densities for different land use/land cover types. Hence, adding the third dimension to population downscaling algorithms seems worth pursuing...|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{numerous}} {{efforts have}} been made to attenuate the expression of argF, at both the translation and transcription levels, with the aim to increase the production of l-ornithine. Those strategies with several advantages over the previous argF deletion can be employed to the existing strains to further improvement of l-ornithine production and may be widely applicable to <b>fine</b> <b>turning</b> the expression of other growth coupled enzymes. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which a terminator-based strategy has been successfully developed to reduce the expression of argF and enhance l-ornithine production. The relative mRNA analysis provides valuable information for enhancing the expression of the upstream genes by insertion of terminator, which may find use in the construction of other middle metabolite producing strains. However, we failed to determine the optimal expression of argF for l-ornithine production without cell growth disturbance, and the l-ornithine production titer achieved in this study was relatively lower than that reported by other studies (Kim et al. 2015). However, insertion of a developed terminator, as performed in this study, is a novel strategy for improving l-ornithine production, which has potential application in engineering other high l-ornithine strains. The successful application of a terminator to regulate upstream and downstream gene expression also hinted at the possible applications of terminators in metabolic engineering to produce valuable products, which would enrich the metabolic engineering strategies for selective strain development. In our recent work, this strategy was employed for development of even higher l-ornithine producing strains by attenuation of proB and ncgl 2228 Zhang et al. (2017). According to our experience, insertion of terminator is a convenient and easy method than gene deletion in the development of engineered C. glutamicum strains. We expect this technology to be extended to allow more laboratories to use it. In our next work, more experiments and examples based on terminators will be provided in the development of high l-ornithine producing strains.|$|E
40|$|The {{obtained}} analytical dependences {{for determining}} the basic parameters of the surface roughness during abrasive polishing are presented with modeling the cutting grains {{in the form of}} a sphere and considering the ordered arrangement of grains. It is shown that with a decrease in the thickness of the cut, the ratio of the altitude parameters of the surface roughness max Ra R / increases, reaching values of 20 [...] . 30 and more. This is consistent with the experimental data obtained by abrasive polishing. Consequently, the modeling of abrasive grains {{in the form of a}} sphere is more in line with the actual conditions for the formation of surface roughness in both abrasive polishing and grinding. Calculations established that the process of abrasive polishing proceeds under conditions corresponding to the transition from the cutting process to the process of friction of the grain with the material being processed. It is also shown that with the reduction of the ratio max Ra R / to 4 [...] . 6 (corresponding to the grinding conditions), the process of metal removal and the formation of surface roughness occurs in a stable cutting process. This establishes a close relationship of the relationship max Ra R / with the ratio of the thickness of the cut and the radius of rounding of the cutting edge of the abrasive grain. It has been experimentally established that when the ball is smoothed out, the ratio max Ra R / = 14. 2, and Ra = 0. 1 mkm. At <b>fine</b> <b>turning</b> with a diamond tool max Ra R / = 21. 2, and Ra = 0. 1 micron. When abrasive polishing max Ra R / = 30, and Ra = 0. 1 micron. The obtained results of theoretical and experimental studies indicate the possibility of a significant decrease in the surface roughness in abrasive polishing, which opens up new technological possibilities for its practical use. ...|$|E
