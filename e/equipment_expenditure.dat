40|$|Some theory {{suggests}} that budget deficits and greater public spending will raise real interest rates and crowd-out private investment; other {{theory suggests}} there is no effect. We attempt to test this in the Thai economy between the years 1978 and 1994. We find that budget deficits did appear to raise real interest rates during our sample period. Our estimates also suggest that, holding the deficit constant, Thai government current and construction expenditure did not raise real interest rates and that Thai government <b>equipment</b> <b>expenditure</b> lowered them. We try to explain the last result with a framework similar to Barro's (1981) but expanded to include foreign trade and borrowing. Foreign borrowing alleviates the pressure on real interest rates to rise, and, under certain conditions, allows them to fall. We find support for this hypothesis from regression results that suggest that, during our sample period, Thai government <b>equipment</b> <b>expenditure</b> was heavily financed from abroad. The results imply that public investment programs in developing countries that do not boost budget deficits and obtain some foreign financing may not crowd-out private investment and could be a promising means of promoting capital formation. ...|$|E

Economists have devoted a great deal of theoretical and empirical effort to tracing monetary influences on plant and <b>equipment</b> <b>expenditure</b> and on residential construction. They have paid relatively less attention to monetary effects on consumption, and saving. Oiae reason has been the wide currency of a simple Keynesian consumption function, a mechanical relation of consumption to disposable income.

In this paper we consider various monetary influences on consumption and attempt to estimate their importance. We do not have a new aggregate consumption function to propose, and we cannot at this point hope to explain the instability of the propensity to consume that has been so troublesome to forecasters and policy makers.

40|$|The {{justification}} {{of reducing the}} cost of engineering products production based {{on the use of}} modern machine tools and instruments is analysed. A new theoretical approach to the determination of the cost of machine parts processing, considering interrelated major cost items: machine operator’s wages and the cutting tool is offered. It is proved that with improvements in processing, the cost varies depending on the extreme, passing the minimum point. It is established theoretically and experimentally confirmed that at the point of processing expences on machine operator’s wages are four times higher than the cost of the cutting tool. It is experimentally found that the share of the cutting tool in the total cost of machine operations is minimal and amounts to an average of 3 %. Therefore, the effect of mechanical processing is primarily due to the decrease of the cost associated with a wage of machine operator and determined performance requirements of processing (primary processing time of an item). This allows to significantly increase the cutting speed and hence productivity of the processing and reduce the costs for wages without noticeable increase in <b>equipment</b> <b>expenditure.</b> To implement this requirement it is necessary to use a more progressive, though costly, cutting tools with a wear-resistant coating, highly resistant and capable of repeated increase in cutting speed and productivity in modern high-speed processing machines such as "processing center" with computer numerical control...|$|E

40|$|A {{stronger}} international {{competitive position}} and brisk domestic demand {{will have a}} positive impact on the Austrian economy in the next years. Assuming that the international financial crisis will be temporary in its detrimental effect and that the public budget consolidation policy will continue, there are no obstacles to the achievement of stable growth. In 1997 - 2002, GDP will grow by 2. 75 percent p. a. on average, which is slightly above the EU average rate. Growth of the Austrian economy has accelerated since 1996. The dynamic development is likely to be temporarily stayed by the effects of turbulences on the international financial markets. After a slight slowdown in 1999, total economic production will once again expand strongly. As a result of production expansion and measures under the National Action Plan for Employment, some 100, 000 additional jobs could be created in the projection period. Unemployment should decline by about 1 percentage point (from 7. 2 percent to 6. 2 percent of the dependently employed in line with the traditional definition; from 4. 4 percent to 3. 7 percent in accordance with the EU definition). The external sector will make a positive contribution to growth of 0. 25 percent of GDP on average. Improved terms of trade and an upswing of the domestic tourism industry will provide for a noticeable reduction of the current account deficit over the next years. In the projection period domestic demand is supported by strong and steadily growing private consumption (+ 2 percent p. a. in real terms on average). Consumer confidence has improved. As a consequence of the growth of disposable real income of private households, the personal savings ratio will gradually be returned to its long-term equilibrium value. At an average growth of 4 percent p. a., gross fixed capital formation up to 2002 will rise at double the pace of 1991 - 1997. Plant and <b>equipment</b> <b>expenditure</b> will develop more dynamically, while building investments will grow moderately as a consequence of the redimensioning process in residential housing construction. Neither import prices nor unit labor cost are expected to make for any upward trend of prices domestically, and sustained competitive pressure effectively restricts price increases, so that prices will remain stable. The average rate of inflation will be 1. 25 percent p. a. According to the projection (which does not consider the plans for tax reform), budget consolidation will continue in 2000, after a hiatus in 1999. The deficit will be less than 1. 5 percent of GDP, government debt, on the other hand, will not decline below 60 percent of GDP. Mittelfristprognose Oesterreich...|$|E

We estimate the structural parameters of a time-to-build model using firm-level investment data on equipment and structures. For <b>equipment</b> <b>expenditures,</b> we find no evidence of time-to-build effects beyond one period. For structures, by contrast, there is clear evidence of time to build in the range of 2 - 3 years. The contrast between equipment and structures is intuitively reasonable and consistent with previous results. The estimates for structures also indicate that initial-period expenditures are low, and increase as projects near completion. These results provide empirical support for including “time to plan ” effects for investment in structures. More generally, these results suggest a potential source of specification error for Q models of investment and production-based asset pricing models that ignore the time required to plan, build and install new capital...|$|R

In anticipation of data to quantify and verify claims and counter claims concerning the effects of MINCs, the following objectives were studied: (1) the trends of the past decade of the U. S. direct investments by Majority Owned foreign affiliates, (2) the identification of significant economic and commercial areas in which public policiesand MNCs investment interact, (3) the major. policy consequences that flow from such interactions, and (4) projections of the trends for the period 1977 and 1979. The main policy areas discussed are: (1) U. S. direct investments (book value), (2) net capital outflows, (3) reinvested earnings, (4) earnings, (5) balance of payments income, (6) sales, and (7) expenditures. The research design incorporates treatment of regressions by using orthogonal polynomial model, correlations and analysis of financial ratios. Secondary source data has been primarily involved in the study. The two major sources of government data were the U. S. Department of Commerce publications from (1) the Bureau of Economic Analysis and (2) the Bureau of International Economic Policy and Research. The analysis of the data indicates that in the past decade (1966 - 75) the investments in the Total World had an increase of 42 percent with an increase of 172 percent in net sales. Developing Countries had an increase of 25 percent in investments with a 250 percent increase in net sales, an increase of 134 percent in plant and <b>equipment</b> <b>expenditures</b> and an increase of 120 percent in capital expenditure. _Asia and Pacific had an increase of 50 percent in investments, with 397 percent in plant and <b>equipment</b> <b>expenditures</b> and 241 percent in capital expenditure. However, in India decreases are indicated of 11 percent in investments and. 13 percent in net sales, an increase of 25 percent was indicated in plant and <b>equipment</b> <b>expenditures,</b> with a decrease of 38 percent in capital expenditures. However, all the areas under study indicated a very significant increase in export sales to other foreign countries which signifies the maximum profit margin according to the analysis. The projections for 1975 - 1979 indicate an increase in investment of 252 percent in Developing Countries 115 * percent in India, and an increase of 14 percent in Total World, with a decrease of 19 percent in Asia' and Pacific. However, there is an increase indicated in net sales of 48 percent in the Total 'world, 28 percent in Developing Countries, 100 percent in Asia and Pacific and 15 percent in India. Similarly, the expenditures project an increase in plant and <b>equipment</b> <b>expenditures</b> of 11 percent in Developing Countries, 43 percent in Asia and Pacific and a decrease of 89 percent in India. The following inferences have been drawn from this study: (1) investments of the 11 NCs are going to increase in the Total World; (2) Asia and Pacific with reference also to India hive a very positive indication of expansion, particularly in petroleum and manufacturing affiliates; (3) net earnings have the maximum returns on export sales to other foreign countries followed by sales to the U. S. in all of the areas; (4) expansion of N 1 NCs investment in Developing Countries and Asia and Pacific indicates a higher return in the Balance of Payments Income, thus indicating a positive impact on the American economy {{as well as on the}} host country's economy; (3) defects of financial market mechanisms in the less developed countries as in India have vitally affected the flow and allocation of funds, the mobility of financial assets, and the value of money; (6) lack of a properly functioning capital market has vitally affected the economic development in the less developed countries. The following suggestions are presented as indicative of needed improvements in regard to the study:(1) A mixture of public and private institutions may achieve a workable allocation of loanable funds in a nation's credit market. (2) In the spirit of long-run analysis, it remains to be noted that current capital outflow gives to future return flow, which may depend on the degree of reinvestment abroad. This may also have its bearing on domestic investment. (3) Profits, before and after foreign tax, should be shown for foreign operations in the branch form. These profits are currently included with other types of foreign income. (4) Foreign taxes paid and the credit claimed against then: should be separated into foreign profit taxes (or other similar taxes) and foreign withholding taxes, and should be attributed to the various forms of foreign income (branch profits, dividends, interest, etc.). (5) The distribution of foreign income and taxes paid by size of total assets of the U. S. reporting corporation is inadequate. The breakdown is not advanced beyond the $ 250 million asset-size class and in some cases the breakdown stops at $ 100 million, even though the vast bulk of foreign income accrues to corporations in size classes above this level. This distribution should thus change. Thesis (M. B. A. ...|$|R
