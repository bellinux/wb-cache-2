5|$|In March 2001, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey {{implemented}} a <b>discount</b> <b>on</b> regular toll fees during off-peak hours for those vehicles paying electronically with an EZ Pass issued in New York State.

Since March 2008, qualified low-emission automobiles with a fuel economy of at least 45 miles per gallon are eligible to receive a Port Authority Green Pass, which allows for a 50% discount during off-peak hours {{as compared to the}} regular full toll.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, {{topographical}} officer George W. Hughes {{reported to}} Secretary of State John M. Clayton that a railroad across the isthmus was a “feasible and practical” idea. Clayton then instructed Robert P. Letcher, the minister to Mexico, {{to negotiate a}} treaty to protect Hargous' rights. The United States' proposal gave Mexicans a 20% <b>discount</b> <b>on</b> shipping, guaranteed Mexican rights in the zone, allowed the United States to send in military if necessary, and gave the United States most-favored-nation status for Mexican cargo fees. This treaty, however, was never finalized.|$|E
5|$|The {{total cost}} of the {{expedition}} was estimated at £90,000 (2009 equivalent about £7.25 million), of which £45,000 was offered by the British Government provided that the two Societies could raise a matching sum. They achieved this, thanks largely to a donation of £25,000 from wealthy RGS member Llewellyn W. Longstaff. The RGS itself contributed £8,000, its largest single contribution to any expedition to that date, and £5,000 came from Alfred Harmsworth, later Lord Northcliffe, who had earlier financed the Jackson-Harmsworth expedition to the Arctic, 1894–97. The rest was raised from smaller donations. The expedition also benefited from significant commercial sponsorship: Colman's provided mustard and flour, Cadbury's gave 3,500lb (1,600kg) of chocolate, Bird's donated baking and custard powders, Evans, Lescher & Webb provided all the lime juice. Jaeger gave a 40% <b>discount</b> <b>on</b> special clothing, Bovril supplied beef extract, and others made significant contributions.|$|E
30|$|The most {{intriguing}} result {{in this study}} was that the direct and indirect influences of price <b>discounts</b> <b>on</b> perceived apparel quality were both significant, but opposite in direction, resulting in an insignificant total effect. The results of the negative direct effect of price <b>discounts</b> <b>on</b> perceived quality may explain why some previous researchers have found a negative effect of price <b>discounts</b> <b>on</b> perceived quality (Garretson and Clow 1999), while the results of the positive indirect effect of price <b>discounts</b> <b>on</b> perceived quality may explain why some other researchers have found a positive effect (Huang et al. 2014; Rungtrakulchai 2013). In addition, the total effect of price <b>discounts</b> <b>on</b> perceived quality was not significant in this study because the opposite direct and indirect effects cancelled each other out. The phenomenon that direct and indirect effects are in opposite directions is referred to as competitive mediation (Shrout and Bolger 2002). These results may explain why a previous study (Grewal et al. 1998 a) found that price discounts had no significant influence on perceived quality.|$|R

5|$|The poor demand {{resulted}} in price cuts for various Windows RT products; in April 2013 {{the price of}} Dell's XPS 10 fell from US$450 US to $300, and Microsoft began offering free covers for its Surface tablet in some territories as a limited-time promotion—itself a US$130 value for the Type Cover alone. Microsoft also reportedly reduced the cost of Windows RT licenses for devices with smaller screens, hoping that this could spur interest in the platform. In July 2013, Microsoft cut {{the price of the}} first-generation Surface worldwide by 30%, with its U.S. price falling to $350. Concurrently, Microsoft reported a loss of US$900 million due to the lackluster sales of the device. In August 2013, Dell silently pulled the option to purchase the XPS 10 from its online store without a keyboard dock (raising its price back up to US$479), and pulled the device entirely in September 2013. Microsoft's <b>discount</b> <b>on</b> the Surface tablet did result in a slight increase of market share for the device; in late-August 2013, usage data from the advertising network AdDuplex (which provides advertising services within Windows Store apps) revealed that Surface usage had increased from 6.2 to 9.8%.|$|E
