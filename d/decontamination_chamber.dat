5|$|During {{the fifth}} season, the Syndicate {{discovered}} that Covarrubias had betrayed them and was providing information to Mulder. Covarrubias was infected with black oil during her {{betrayal of the}} Syndicate, and Syndicate scientists used her to test a vaccine they had been working to create. While the Syndicate-developed vaccine proves ineffective, Covarrubias' infection is ultimately cured by an effective vaccine stolen from a Russian shadow-government group by Alex Krycek. In the following season, Covarrubias is discovered by FBI agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) at a <b>decontamination</b> <b>chamber.</b> She begs him to help her escape the facility, addressing him by name as well as giving him information about the whereabouts of his mother, Cassandra. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a former Syndicate agent now acting alone, is also present at the facility. He declines to help the pair, and leaves Covarrubias for dead.|$|E
5|$|The Orions {{are placed}} under {{guard in the}} <b>decontamination</b> <b>chamber.</b> Harrad-Sar returns in his vessel and attacks the now {{disabled}} Enterprise, and then begins to tow it away. He reveals that, in fact, the Syndicate seeks Archer's head, and in this matter he is the slave and the Orion women are his masters. The Orions escape and travel to the Bridge, as do T'Pol and Tucker. Navaar tells Archer to arrest T'Pol, but Tucker stuns all the male crew-members with his phaser, and T'Pol disables the Orion ship with a pulse sent from Enterprise deflector dish. They send the Orions back to their ship, and T'Pol finally admits she would personally like Tucker to return, and he replies that he has already requested a transfer back to Enterprise.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to firefighting duties Fireboat 20 {{and her sister}} have air-tight crew compartments and a <b>decontamination</b> <b>chamber,</b> so they are equipped {{to respond to the}} releases of hazardous material, in particular they can respond to radiological, poison gas, or germ warfare attacks.The vessels pumps can de-water flooded structures. The vessels are highly automated, and require only a crew of four. But they can transport 12 additional individuals. Part of the cabin can serve as an emergency infirmary, so carrying emergency medical technicians can make sense, or additional firefighters, or hazmat technicians.|$|E
40|$|A {{high-vacuum}} complex {{composed of}} an atmospheric <b>decontamination</b> system, sample-processing <b>chambers,</b> storage chambers, and a transfer system {{was built to}} process and examine lunar material while maintaining quarantine status. Problems identified, equipment modifications, and procedure changes made for Apollo 11 and 12 sample processing are presented. The sample processing experiences indicate {{that only a few}} operating personnel are required to process the sample efficiently, safely, and rapidly in the high-vacuum complex. The high-vacuum complex was designed to handle the many contingencies, both quarantine and scientific, associated with handling an unknown entity such as the lunar sample. Lunar sample handling necessitated a complex system that could not respond rapidly to changing scientific requirements as the characteristics of the lunar sample were better defined. Although the complex successfully handled the processing of Apollo 11 and 12 lunar samples, the scientific requirement for vacuum samples was deleted after the Apollo 12 mission just as the vacuum system was reaching its full potential...|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: Various {{conventional}} {{methods such as}} gaseous, vapour and misting systems, fogging, manual {{spray and}} wipe techniques employing a number of chemical agents are used for decontamination of enclosed spaces. Among all these methods, use of aerosolized formaldehyde is the most preferred method due to cost-effectiveness and practical aspects. However, being extremely corrosive in nature generating very irritating fumes and difficulty in maintaining {{a high level of}} gas concentration, many laboratories prefer the vaporization of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) as an alternative. We present here the results of using H 2 O 2 vapour in combination with plasma irradiation for quick <b>decontamination</b> of closed <b>chambers.</b> Methods: The present study describes a decontamination method, using plasma irradiation in combination with H 2 O 2 (5 %). Effect of plasma irradiation and H 2 O 2 on the viability of bacterial spores (Bacillus subtilis), Chikungunya and Kyasanur Forest Disease viruses was assessed. Results: Data suggest that with the combination of H 2 O 2 vapour and plasma irradiation, within short time (three minutes), decontamination of surfaces and space volume could be achieved. Although it showed damage of spores present on the strips, it did not show any penetration power. Interpretation & conclusions: The results were encouraging, and this method was found to be efficient for achieving surface sterilization in a short time. This application may be useful in laboratories and industries particularly, those working on clean facility concept following good laboratory and manufacturing practices...|$|R

40|$|Styrene is a benzene {{derivative}} of the aromatic hydrocarbon which {{is widely used}} {{in the manufacture of}} plastics industry, synthetic rubber and insulating materials. Its toxic effects occur by inhalation of its vapor or by direct contact. In acute intoxication irritation in the eye and skin may occur and chemical pneumonitis may develop in the lungs due to inhalation. It dissolves in ethanol, benzene, acetone and ether. Water solubility is low. In this paper we present the management of a patient who after falling down from the scaffold which is approximately 5 meters of height, a tin of styrene on the same scaffold spilled on him and we would like {{to draw attention to the}} need for <b>decontamination</b> <b>chamber</b> which is not available in the most of the emergency departments in our country...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} vehicle, control system, {{and waste}} and water scavenging system were designed and fabricated with essentially the full {{capabilities of the}} vehicle system proposed by ARD Environmental. A test tank mockup, including riser and <b>decontamination</b> <b>chamber</b> were designed and fabricated, and approximately 830 cubic feet of six varieties of waste simulants poured. The tests were performed by ARD Environmental personnel at its site in Laurel, Maryland, from 4 / 22 / 97 through 5 / 2 / 97. The capabilities tested were deployment and retrieval, extended mobility and productivity, the ability to operate the system using video viewing only, retrieval after simulated failure, and retrieval and decontamination. Testing commenced with deployment of the vehicle into the tank. Deployment was accomplished using a crane and auxiliary winch to position the vehicle and lower it through the <b>decontamination</b> <b>chamber,</b> into the 36 `` diameter x 6 ` high riser, and touch down on the waste field in the tank. The initial mobility tests were conducted immediately after deployment, prior to sluicing, as the waste field exhibited {{the greatest amount of}} variation at this time. This test demonstrated the ability of the vehicle to maneuver over the simulated waste field, and the ability of the operator to work with only video viewing available. In addition, the ability of the vehicle to right itself after being turned on its side was demonstrated. The production rate was evaluated daily through the testing period by measuring the surface and estimating the amount of material removed. The test demonstrated the ability of the vehicle to reduce the waste surface using 400 psi (nominal) water jets, scavenge water and material from the work area, and move to any location, even in the relatively confined space of the 20 ` diameter test tank. In addition, the ability to sluice to a remote scavenging module was demonstrated. The failure mode test demonstrated the ability to retrieve a stuck vehicle by pulling on the tether, even if the vehicle wheels were locked or the vehicle was on its side. Line pull required to retrieve the vehicle was measured, and side load on the riser calculated from the line pull and line angles. Finally, the decontamination test demonstrated the ability to effectively clean the umbilical and vehicle. The issues addressed and resolved during the testing were: Feasibility of deploying a vehicle- based system, mobility, production rate and limitation of water in the tank during sluicing, mining strategy, operator efficiency, vehicle recovery, and decontamination. Water usage and waste removal rates were used to estimate the time and water usage requirements for cleaning a Hanford SST...|$|E
40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has {{published}} a standard that specifies the criteria for preparation and packaging of plutonium metals and oxides for safe long-term storage (DOE-STD- 3013 - 96). This standard is followed for the packaging of materials resulting from the disassembly of nuclear weapons at Los Alamos National Laboratory under the Advanced Retirement and Integrated Extraction System (ARIES) project. Declassified plutonium metal or oxide material from the ARES project is packaged into doubly contained and welded type 304 L stainless steel containers that comply with the DOE standard. The 3013 - 96 standard describes requirements for maximum contamination limits on the outer surface of the sealed inner container. These limits are 500 dpm per 100 cm 2 for direct measurements and 20 dpm per 100 cm 2 for removable contamination. For containers filled, welded, and handled inside a highly contaminated glovebox line, these limits are difficult to obtain. Simple handling within the line is demonstrated to contaminate surfaces from 10, 000 to 10, 000, 000 dpm alpha per 100 cm 2. To routinely achieve contamination levels below the maximum contamination levels specified by the 3013 - 96 standard within a processing operation, a decontamination step must be included. In the ARIES line, this decontamination step is an electrolytic process that produces a controlled uniform etch of the container surfaces. Decontamination of the 3013 - 96 compliant ARIES inner container is well demonstrated. Within 30 to 50 minutes electrolysis time, tixed contamination is reduced to hundreds of dpm generally occurring only at electrode contact points and welds. Removable contamination is routinely brought to non-detectable levels. The total process time for the cycle (includes electrolysis, rinse, and dry stages) is {{on the order of}} 1. 5 to 2 hours per container. The ARIES inner container decontamination system highly automated and consists of a plumbing loop, electronic controls and process monitors, and a <b>decontamination</b> <b>chamber</b> or "fixture". The tixture is situated like an air lock between a contaminated and an uncontaminated section of a processing glovebox. The welded and leak tested container is placed into the fixture through a door on the contaminated side and the electrolysis process is run, including rinse and dry cycles. The container is then removed through a second door into the uncontaminated side where it is monitored for surface alpha contamination, leak checked, and reweighed...|$|E
