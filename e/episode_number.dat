The idea for a Game Boy Color Keen game came from John Carmack and id, who approached Activision, which in turn proposed Palmer as the developer.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the film}} was simply titled The Empire Strikes Back in its {{original}} promotional materials, the film still started with the title Star Wars on-screen which {{was followed by the}} opening crawl that gave the film's subtitle as Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, causing some surprise among cinema goers at the time as the original Star Wars film had not been given an <b>episode</b> <b>number</b> or subtitle for its first release in 1977. However, Episode IV: A New Hope was added to its opening crawl from its 1981 re-release onwards. Like A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back was rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America, and certificate U in the United Kingdom. This original version was released on CED in 1984 and on VHS and Laserdisc several times during the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
25|$|When {{the show}} {{moved back to}} Saturday nights in September 1992, the series length was {{extended}} to 24 episodes per year, {{and placed in a}} pre-watershed slot at approximately 8 pm. This initially caused some controversy due to the graphic and controversial nature of some of the storylines. In 1997-8, the <b>episode</b> <b>number</b> was increased again, with 26 episodes (including two 75-minute specials) making up series 12. Subsequent series each saw an increase in episodes; series 13 ran for 28 episodes, series 14 ran for 30 episodes, series 15 ran for 36 episodes, series 16 and 17 ran for 40 episodes and series 18 ran for 46 episodes. Since 2004, popularity of the show resulted in a switch from a traditional seasonal format (which had progressed from three months in its early years to around seven months by 2001) to an almost year-round production and transmission— each series from series 19 (2004/5) to 25 (2010/11) has lasted for 48 episodes. However, this figure was dropped to 42 for series 26, with no summer break, which was related to production moving from Bristol to Cardiff. Series 27 consists of 44 episodesan increase of 2 episodes on the previous series and returned to 48 for series 28. In addition, from series 26, the show also began broadcasting in August of their respective years, rather than start in September with a two week break in late December.|$|E

2500|$|Marzipan's Answering Machine is {{a series}} of {{cartoons}} with almost no animation. It features messages from the other characters, being played on the answering machine belonging to the character Marzipan. In early episodes, the <b>episode</b> <b>number</b> ended in [...]0 (for example, Marzipan's Answering Machine Version 5.0), but since Marzipan changed to a new answering machine, the number ends in [...]2 (for example, Marzipan's Answering Machine Version 15.2). In every episode, Strong Bad prank calls Marzipan, badly pretending to be someone else, such as [...] "Detective Everybody", [...] "Safety Dan", and sometimes other characters. Although the animation is usually just a picture of the answering machine, sometimes there are short animated segments featuring the characters. As of April 1, 2016, there are 17 Marzipan's Answering Machines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} released in 1977 {{with the title}} [...] "Star Wars". The subtitles Episode IV and A New Hope were only added to the opening crawl in subsequent re-releases. Accounts differ as to when this designation was first added; some date the change at the theatrical re-release of April 10, 1981, while others place it much earlier at the re-release in July 1978. [...] The retroactive addition of these subtitles was intended to bring the film into line with the introduction to its sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, which was released in 1980 bearing the designation [...] "Episode V". It is uncertain if the introduction of an episodic naming convention was an indicator of Lucas's original intent, or if this was simply a later redraft of the narrative. According to some accounts, Lucas has claimed that he was discouraged by Twentieth Century Fox from using an <b>episode</b> <b>number</b> on a new film because it would confuse audiences. Gary Kurtz has stated that he and Lucas had originally considered using an <b>episode</b> <b>number</b> for Star Wars to emulate the chapter numbering used in the 1936 Flash Gordon installments, but they were uncertain whether they should designate it Episode III, IV or V. However, some of Lucas's early script drafts bear titles such as [...] "The Adventures of the Starkiller (Episode One): The Star Wars" [...] (1975) or [...] "The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as Taken from the Journal of the Whills: Saga One: Star Wars" [...] (1976). The Revised Fourth Draft of the script dated January 1975 acquired the subtitle [...] "Episode IV – A New Hope – from the Journal of the Whills" [...] when published in the 1979 book The Art of Star Wars.|$|E

6000|$|The {{orchestra}} {{played a}} selection from the [...] "Gondola Girl," [...] {{which was the}} leading musical-comedy of the moment. Most of the audience, those in the more expensive seats at any rate, heard the same airs {{two or three times}} daily, at restaurant lunches, teas, dinners and suppers, and occasionally in the Park; they were justified therefore in treating the music as a background to slightly louder conversation than they had hitherto indulged in. The music came to an end, <b>episode</b> <b>number</b> two in the evening's entertainment was signalled, the curtain of Alexandrine blue rolled heavily upward, and a troupe of performing wolves was presented to the public. Yeovil had encountered wolves in North Africa deserts and in Siberian forest and wold, he had seen them at twilight stealing like dark shadows across the snow, and heard their long whimpering howl in the darkness amid the pines; he could well understand how a magic lore had grown up round them through the ages among the peoples of four continents, how their name had passed into a hundred strange sayings and inspired a hundred traditions. And now he saw them ride round the stage on tricycles, with grotesque ruffles round their necks and clown caps on their heads, their eyes blinking miserably in the blaze of the footlights. In response to the applause of the house a stout, atrociously smiling man in evening dress came forward and bowed; he had had nothing to do either with the capture or the training of the animals, having bought them ready for use from a continental emporium where wild beasts were prepared for the music-hall market, but he continued bowing and smiling till the curtain fell.|$|E

50|$|Season 10 {{introduced}} a new episode numbering system.

So, for example, the third episode of the 4th season would be <b>episode</b> <b>number</b> 403. Starting with this season, episodes numbers consisted of four digits with the first two digits representing the last two digits {{of the year in}} which the season first aired and the last two digits representing the <b>episode</b> <b>number</b> within that season. So, the fourth episode of the 10th season, having first aired in 1998, would be <b>episode</b> <b>number</b> 9804.|$|E
