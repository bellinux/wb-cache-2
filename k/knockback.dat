500|$|When Rhys {{is offered}} {{the chance to}} apply for a three-month work {{placement}} in Japan, he decides to apply and then convince Vanessa to go with him. Barber revealed [...] "He puts himself and his heart on the line like he's never done before. At first, Vanessa says no - and he's devastated. He's in a really vulnerable place and he doesn't take her <b>knockback</b> well. Rhys has been a bit of a ladies man all his life and he's never really committed to someone before Vanessa. She's a pretty special girl as far as Rhys is concerned." [...] Rhys becomes determined not to give up and he is [...] "thrilled" [...] when Vanessa changes her mind. Barber teased that it is possible viewers could see the last of Rhys and Vanessa for a while, adding [...] "There are definitely interesting times ahead!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Infinite also {{implements}} the Infinity Stones as a gameplay mechanic, {{similar to}} Marvel Super Heroes, where each stone grants unique abilities. Before the match begins, each player selects {{one of the}} six Infinity Stones – Power, Space, Time, Reality, Mind, and Soul – which bestows one ability that can be activated at any time, known as the [...] "Infinity Surge". For example, the Power Stone produces a <b>knockback</b> effect when used, while the Space Stone pulls an opponent closer to the player character. A second, stronger ability called the [...] "Infinity Storm" [...] can be activated after a player fills their Infinity meter at least halfway, giving them a significant boost for a limited time, similar to the X-Factor system from Marvel vs. Capcom 3. The boost is determined by the chosen Infinity Stone; for example, the Power Stone increases the user's damage output and combo ability, while the Space Stone traps an opponent within a confined area that severely limits their movement.|$|E
5000|$|A new {{defensive}} {{skill is}} the ability to <b>knockback</b> enemies and objects. The bat, dash, and reflect EX are the only ways to <b>knockback</b> enemies. Enemies that are knockedback can <b>knockback</b> other enemies which could cascade into a very large and damaging [...] "wave" [...] of knockedback enemies.|$|E
40|$|Word squares {{have always}} fascinated me. From {{an early age}} I took delight in devising regular 3 -by- 3 and 4 -by- 4 squares, perhaps to the {{detriment}} of a few well-meaning teachers, who mistook my linguistic activities for doodling. Undeterred by these <b>knockbacks,</b> I continued to practise the forbidden art, being more careful not to get caught...|$|R
5000|$|On 1 March 1933, {{just four}} weeks after Adolf Hitler had become German Chancellor, Schoenberg {{resigned}} from his teaching post {{in the face of}} imminent dismissal for being part of what Hitler had described as [...] "the Jewish stranglehold on Western music". He moved to Paris on 16 May, intending to remain there, but he had no luck in securing a French publisher or any conducting opportunities. He wrote to Edward Clark by postcard later that month, asking him to use his contacts to get him some performances of the Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra, and a British publisher for that work and the Cello Concerto. He was also seeking to have his Jewish drama, written 1925-26, be published by a British Jewish publisher. Clark approached a number of people on Schoenberg's behalf, but received only <b>knockbacks.</b> He did, however, arrange for two concerts in November, in which Pierrot Lunaire and the Suite, Op. 29 would receive performances. But it was not to be. Schoenberg received an offer of a teaching post at a Boston music academy, and decided to quit Europe, sailing for the United States on 25 October 1933.|$|R
50|$|Bialoguski had {{maintained}} {{his passion for}} music, and sought conducting lessons from Sir Eugene Goossens, then based in Sydney, but was rebuffed. Earlier, in 1949, Goossens had invited him to accept a position as a violinist in the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, {{of which he was}} the chief conductor. In 1964 Bialoguski and his wife moved permanently to England. Although continuing to make his living from medicine, he still strove to become a conductor, but was met with continual <b>knockbacks.</b> Sir Adrian Boult suggested he should stay with medicine. He applied for entry to the conducting courses at the Royal Academy of Music and Royal College of Music, but was rejected on account of his age. He did some private conducting training with Ernest Read in London. He was accepted by the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena, Italy, where he obtained his Masters Diploma in 1967 under the guidance of Franco Ferrara. Then, unable to secure any regular conducting engagements back in the UK, he spent his life savings on hiring the New Philharmonia Orchestra for a single concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 29 April 1969, which he conducted, to lukewarm reviews. The concert included Beethoven's 4th Symphony and Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 with the pianist Fou Ts'ong as soloist.|$|R
50|$|Frag: Fire Zone, {{the second}} expansion, adds lava, rocket jumps, <b>knockback</b> effects from weapons and jump pads. It {{includes}} two extra boards.|$|E
50|$|In the game, Team Fortress 2 (2007), players {{could use}} the {{explosive}} <b>knockback</b> of a Soldier's rockets to rocket jump. Rocket jumping usually costs players around 40 health (1/5th of Soldier's total hp). As the Soldier class has a 40% resistance to his own rockets that do not damage other players. In addition, damage boosters, such as critical hits or mini-critical hits do not give extra self <b>knockback</b> or self damage to the Soldier, so they will not propel him further. Items such as the Rocket Jumper, Liberty Launcher, or Gunboats can reduce self damage from rocket jumping.|$|E
50|$|The Landmaster tank {{makes its}} most recent {{appearance}} in Super Smash Bros. Brawl (2008, Wii) as Fox's Final Smash. The same design — in alternate color schemes — is also used as the Final Smash for Falco Lombardi and Wolf O'Donnell. All three Landmasters have slightly different properties. The Landmaster that Fox and Falco use is the traditional white and blue color scheme, while Wolf's Landmaster is a black and red color scheme. Falco's Landmaster can fly higher and longer than Fox's but its firepower has reduced <b>knockback.</b> In addition, Wolf's Landmaster has greater firepower and <b>knockback</b> ability than the one Fox and Falco use, but it remains on {{the stage for a}} much shorter time.|$|E
40|$|Building on his Guardian pieces about {{teaching}} Philosophy in prison, this is Alan Smith’s account in extenso. From introducing Plato to ever-changing groups of hard-nosed prisoners to them wrestling with Bentham, Larkin and Shakespeare, it {{is packed with}} insights and unexpected turns. It paints a picture in which worlds collide and conventional morality is turned inside out as ‘new modes of discourse’ change the men’s thinking and ideas. At times surreal the book brings fresh perspectives to the minutiae of prison life: survival, coping, soap, teabags, cell mates, the constant noise and immediacy. And needless to say, the men come up with philosophical gems of their own. Her Majesty’s Philosophers is also about isolation, the long hours, <b>knockbacks</b> and the emotional mutilation of imprisonment; and whilst philosophy is ‘soft and fluffy’ it contrasts starkly with the pragmatic world of prison officers, for whom the Holy Grail is Security, Keys and Prison Craft. The book charts how learning changes lives, especially for prisoners who missed out on formal education, who—once motivated—become voracious readers and extraordinary students. It demonstrates more than any official report {{the value of a}} wider agenda than Basic Skills. Prisons have been labelled ‘Universities of Crime’, but colleges are increasingly populated by those who began their studies in a prison cell. In a book packed with wisdom and humour the author laments the fact that prison policy means that this is becoming a far less easy step...|$|R
5000|$|Alan is {{sympathetic}} {{and willing to}} help Frankie through her psychological problems, but she has already set her sights on a new man, Tony Hills (Mark Homer). Even though Tony is in a homosexual relationship with another man, Frankie seduces him, and after copious amounts of alcohol, they have sex together. Tony is desperate to keep their tryst a secret from his boyfriend, Simon (Andrew Lynford). He tells Frankie that their night together was a mistake, however, Frankie will not accept rejection; she attempts to blackmail him into continuing their affair, threatening to out him as a homosexual, and tell his boyfriend what has occurred. Tony fears the repercussions, but he refuses to give Frankie what she wants, and she has further <b>knockbacks</b> from Sanjay Kapoor (Deepak Verma) and her neighbour Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), who throws her {{out of his house}} after she propositions him, branding her a [...] "scrubber" [...] with [...] "no class". Feeling sorry for herself, Frankie seeks salvation from evangelist Alistair Matthews (Neil Clark). She starts off by singing at one of his prayer groups, and Alistair takes a keen interest in her spiritual welfare. Frankie takes this the wrong way, assuming that Alistair is interested in her sexually. She tries to seduce him on numerous occasions, but Alistair rejects her each time. This bruises Frankie’s ego, and she starts spreading rumours that they had had sex together in an attempt to make Alan jealous. Alistair fears that his reputation is being tarnished. He confronts Frankie in The Queen Victoria public house, exposing her lies and humiliating her in front of everyone. Frankie turns to Alan for support, but he shuns her, finally realising what a liar she is. Incensed, Frankie turns violent and attempts to assault Alan, until her friend Mick shows up and drags her away. Frankie moves away from Walford and Mick later mentions that she has quit their band.|$|R
50|$|Anti-riot {{water cannon}} (expansion): Much like the water guns, the water cannon is {{focusing}} Mion's playstyle {{on a more}} brutal and burst damage output {{at the expense of}} the hitstun, swapped with some <b>knockback</b> effect and recoil on herself. The projectiles are far less spread, focusing much more on straight and longer trajectories, with a much faster reloading and charging speed.|$|E
50|$|In 2008 it was {{described}} as having quietly begun to rival the 'big two' of agricultural industry in Australia, Elders Limited and Landmark. By 2014 it owned 10.1% of Elders, unsuccessfully attempting to purchase the rural services section of Elders for 250 million in 2013. Following falling profits from Elders and the <b>knockback</b> of its purchase offer, it sold all 10.1% of the company.|$|E
50|$|LouisEX: The fastest fighter in the game. He {{can fire}} five-hit Dragon Palm combo {{if he has}} maximum mana. When he runs, his spear will damage people he touches, and he's got a useful <b>knockback</b> attack. He also has a very {{powerful}} combo, however, {{it can only be}} interrupted if he takes damage. Louis can turn into him, trading armour and a few abilities for LouisEX's one ability, speed, and spear.|$|E
5000|$|Mutant [...] - [...] All players {{start in}} a deathmatch setting with all weapons, {{and the first}} player to kill becomes the [...] "mutant". This player {{receives}} unlimited ammo, camouflage, Berserk (Increases rate of fire and <b>knockback)</b> and super speed for an indefinite amount of time, but he slowly loses health and can't pick up any health items. When the mutant is killed, the mutant powers are passed to the killer.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Real Combat" [...] {{system is}} used in {{one-on-one}} weapon battles, as well as during spell-casting, ranged combat and mounted combat. In some situations however, players will choose to band together and unite their skills to face other bands of players or non-player armies. Players can then work together and build on each other's strengths, for example a character standing in line with a 'Conqueror' when he is running will have a greater resistance to <b>knockback</b> effects.|$|E
5000|$|The {{game has}} {{a total of}} 4 modes: Mega Battle gives the players an ability to use the Mega Mushroom, which allows the player to have more power and better range; <b>Knockback</b> Challenge has the player facing {{challenging}} AI opponents; Classic Tennis allows players {{to change the rules}} such as [...] "Chance Shots, Jump Shots and power-ups"; and the Online Mode allows players to team up with another player. Online play does not support friend-based matchmaking, only allowing matchmaking with other random players. Players can also use amiibo to play against other players.|$|E
5000|$|Roadhog, {{real name}} Mako Rutledge, is Junkrat's {{enforcer}} and bodyguard of unknown nationality. He wields a Scrap Gun that fires shrapnel in a mid-range automatic firing mode, or a short-range shotgun-like single shot. He also carries a NOS canister filled with [...] "Hogdrogen" [...] to self-heal (Take a Breather), and employs a Chain Hook to pull distant opponents towards him. His ultimate ability, Whole Hog, {{allows him to}} put a top loader into his scrap gun, firing it in full auto mode with increased <b>knockback,</b> wider spread, and no need to reload.|$|E
5000|$|Recoil (often called <b>knockback,</b> {{kickback}} {{or simply}} kick) is the backward movement {{of a gun}} when it is discharged. In technical terms, the recoil momentum acquired by the gun exactly balances the forward momentum of the projectile and exhaust gases (ejecta), according to Newton's third law, known as conservation of momentum. In hand-held small arms, the recoil momentum is transferred to the ground through {{the body of the}} shooter; while in heavier guns such as mounted machine guns or cannons, recoil momentum is transferred to the ground through the mount.|$|E
5000|$|A crouch tap rocket jump, usually {{abbreviated}} as [...] "c-tapping", is {{when the}} player jumps rocket jumps and crouch taps, instead of crouch jumping. This means that the player crouches a split second before jumping and shooting. Because the player becomes closer to the rocket's <b>knockback</b> from a crouch tap than a crouch jump, the player will gain the maximum velocity and distance possible from a jump. Crouch tap jumps are used to reach places that require the player to achieve great heights, such as Badlands spire from grey bridge, as seen in Muselk's c-tapping video.|$|E
5000|$|Winston is {{a genetically}} {{engineered}} gorilla, scientist and adventurer. He wields a short-range Tesla Cannon that requires no aiming, and wears armor that incorporates a Jump Pack, {{allowing him to}} make leaps across great distances and damage foes on landing. He can also deploy a Barrier Projector that provides a temporary spherical shield to protect himself and teammates from enemy fire. Winston's ultimate ability is Primal Rage, in which he briefly gives in to [...] "the beast within" [...] to get massively increased health and powerful melee attacks with <b>knockback,</b> although he foregoes his primary weapon.|$|E
50|$|Pharah, {{real name}} Fareeha Amari, is an Egyptian {{security}} officer. She wears the Raptora Mark VI, a jetpack-equipped combat suit, and wields a Rocket Launcher as her primary weapon. She has a Wedjat (Eye of Horus) tattoo around her right eye. Her abilities are Concussion Blast, a rocket with powerful <b>knockback</b> but no damage, and Jump Jets, a quick jetpack-assisted vertical ascension comparable to a rocket jump. Her passive ability {{allows her to}} hover in the air, which is paired well with her Jump Jets ability. Pharah's ultimate ability is Rocket Barrage, a continuous stream of small air-to-ground projectiles, while she is frozen still in place.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a huge}} {{roster of}} enemies all of {{different}} stats and types. Certain types of enemies can have advantages over others. For example, while all the non-white enemies have higher stats than their white counterparts, black and angel enemies have higher speeds and <b>knockback</b> counts, while zombie enemies can burrow past cats and can revive themselves {{a limited amount of}} times. While it now seems like the enemy has an unfair advantage, everything's fine as certain cats have advantages over certain types of enemy. For example, Weightlifter Cat is a massive damage anti-black enemy, meaning that he does massive damage against black enemies (while the damage is less for non-black enemies).|$|E

5000|$|Though popularized in {{television}} and movies, and {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "true stopping power" [...] by uneducated proponents of large powerful calibers such as [...]44 Magnum, the effect of <b>knockback</b> from a handgun and indeed most personal weapons is largely a myth. The momentum of the so-called [...] "manstopper" [...]45 ACP bullet is approximately that of a 1 lb mass dropped from a height of 11.4 ft. [...] Such a force is simply incapable of arresting a running target's forward momentum. In addition, bullets are designed to penetrate instead of strike a blunt force blow, because, in penetrating, more severe tissue damage is done. A bullet with sufficient energy to knock down an assailant, such as a high-speed rifle bullet, {{would be more likely to}} instead pass straight through, while not transferring the full energy (in fact only a very small percentage of the full energy) of the bullet to the victim.|$|E
5000|$|Infinite also {{implements}} the Infinity Stones as a gameplay mechanic, {{similar to}} Marvel Super Heroes, where each stone grants unique abilities. Each player selects one Infinity Stone before the match begins, which bestows one ability {{that can be}} activated at any time, known as the [...] "Infinity Surge".

The game will also include a two-hour cinematic story mode; single-player modes, such as training, mission, and arcade mode; a collection mode, where extras unlocked through the story and arcade modes are stored; and online multiplayer with ranked and casual matches, global leaderboards, and online lobbies with spectating.|$|E
50|$|Priestess: the beautiful, young, warrior-priestess is {{the most}} {{appropriate}} character for beginners, who have yet to learn the games differences and enemy arrangement, thanks to her defensive spells which allow her to heal and negate damage. Offensively, she is competent against normal enemies due to the long reach and penetration of her final weapon. However, her weapons are the slowest among all the characters in both attack and recovery, making her the weakest boss killer in the game. Defensively, {{she is able to}} cast a highly useful protection spell that absorbs 32 damage and removes the <b>knockback</b> from getting hit. The priestess also has the ability to add more playing time in the arcade version of Cadash (30 seconds in the Japanese version, and 60 seconds in all other versions). In the Japanese version of Cadash, the priestess is a much less effective character overall: she is the least suitable character to bypass the second level and fight stone golems for lucrative experience (which is a well-known and critical strategy when playing optimally) since she cannot compensate for her weakness at that point in the game with the much cheaper medicinal herbs sold in the overseas versions, and she cannot exploit staying at inns to increase the playing time due to the exorbitant inn prices in the Japanese version.|$|E
50|$|Olimar is a playable {{character}} in the Wii title, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and its sequel, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. He commands the Pikmin in battle and, like in the Pikmin series, he is almost entirely dependent on them. Olimar is able to pluck new Pikmin from the ground at any time unless he has {{the maximum number of}} Pikmin allowed; he can command up to six in Brawl, and three in 3DS/Wii U. The Pikmin, as in the Pikmin series, are fragile and can be defeated easily, but new ones can be plucked from the stage immediately after. Olimar's Final Smash, a signature one-use technique, shows him getting into his Hocotate Spaceship and flying off into the sky, while Red Bulborbs damage the other players on the ground. The ship then plummets to the ground and causes an explosion, dealing damage and <b>knockback</b> to opposing players as Olimar is ejected from it. Super Smash Bros. Brawl also features a playable stage called Distant Planet, based on the general setting of the Pikmin's home planet featured in the first three Pikmin titles. The same stage returns in the 3DS version, while the Wii U version has a new Pikmin stage called Garden of Hope, which is based on the area of the same name in Pikmin 3. Alph from Pikmin 3 also appears as an alternate costume for Olimar, although he merely functions as an aesthetic alternative, rather than a distinct alternative in regards to gameplay.|$|E
40|$|Comparisons {{with the}} Great Depression ignore decades of globalisation, write SHAHAR HAMEIRI and TOBY CARROLL On 29 Sepember, US$ 1. 2 {{trillion}} was wiped off {{the value of}} the New York Stock Exchange as members of the House of Representatives in the US, under pressure from constituents, voted against the US$ 700 billon bailout package designed to resuscitate the financial system. The <b>knockback</b> sent reverberations around the world, with markets falling sharply from Europe to East Asia. What this <b>knockback</b> demonstrated, despite the “we are all capitalists now” proclamations of recent years, is that many Americans feel little affinity with the Wall Street set who had been “managing” their investments and who had extended their mortgages (without worrying about who would extend the cash needed to service them). Many argue that this is a crisis of regulation, or a crisis of responsibility and ethics, as if these were technical problems to be tweaked. However, the roots of the political (as opposed to the strictly financial) crisis we are currently witnessing run much deeper. A quarter of a century of globalisation has fundamentally transformed not only our economies, but also our states and societies, leaving politicians few options. While the current crisis has often been compared to the Great Depression of the 1930 s, the two periods are distinctly different. The way out of the Great Depression essentially involved the establishing of a political compact between industrial capitalists and organised labour, with the state acting to stimulate demand and mitigate the risk to workers through a variety of compensatory mechanisms. What followed was a period of relatively equitable economic growth in the developed world that, among other things, gave birth to the mass consumer society of our time. In contrast, the era of globalisation, which was ushered in by declining rates of profit and other crises in the 1970 s and ’ 80 s, has involved a process of “financialisation”, where the relationship between industrial and financial capital, which concerned political economists from Marx to Keynes, has apparently become largely redundant. Financial deregulation has permitted the enormous growth of global markets for a variety of financial products, which act somewhat autonomously from and greatly eclipse the “real” economy of trade in goods and services. Financialisation has been part of a broader process that has placed the market at the centre of social relations, redistributing wealth and power. This has involved assaults against worker rights in many industrialised countries at a time where capital has been liberated to relocate to sources of cheaper labour. Furthermore, at the same time many workers in the West have been both voluntarily and forcibly drawn into becoming investors - substituting the socialisation of risk that was embodied in the welfare state with tying pension plans to the market like never before. And while the massive extension of credit, both in the form of mortgages and credit cards (which are now often tied together), provided palliative care to many, with some workers experiencing declining real wages, it also served to further lock them to a highly volatile system in which they had very little power to advance their interests vis-a-vis highly powerful and well-connected market players. Meanwhile, the risk to capital has been socialised, with public bailouts a common feature of the past 25 years, regardless of the recent failure of the US government’s rescue package. Yet, despite such bailouts, under globalisation arguments have been continuously advanced for less regulation and for the importance of paying CEOs “well”. In this hyper-capitalist environment inequality has been soaring, with the average pay packet of a high-end American CEO being 250 times that of an average wage earner. In short, there has been concentration of capital that still retains an insatiable appetite for profit. In trying to satisfy this appetite capital has gone in search of returns in dangerous waters (such as that section of the population that aspires to owning homes yet has been so marginalised that it does not have the means to service its borrowings). In the short term, you can disguise this concentration by creating complex financial instruments to on-sell. In the medium-to-longer term, reality hits home when people begin to default. So the big question seems to be not how to reregulate financial markets, but whether everyday citizens can be convinced that their interests are advanced by a different set of interests to theirs and an ideology that has spent the past quarter of a century eroding the “over-regulation” of the Western welfare state and dispensing with its social safeguards. While US taxpayers were told by people like US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that bailing out capital was necessary to support the system for everyone and that caution had to be exercised in reregulating the financial sector, middle America doesn’t appear to have much sympathy for him or the obscenely remunerated “Just Do It” set at the centre of this debacle. The US government has put together another bailout package, but the crisis seems far from over for the very reason {{that it is hard to}} see where new sources of real productive output will emerge, especially in an economy such as the United States. The game of smoke and mirrors no longer holds any attraction for those left with cash to allocate. Where the fix to the Great Depression came in the form of redistributive measures to workers within the domestic economy - a globalised world makes this process next to impossible for the very reason that capital can so easily relocate to cheaper sources of labour outside of America. Even if capital can get back on its feet with a public bailout, finding profitable undertakings inside US borders that benefit the broad population seems highly unlikely. • Shahar Hameiri is a doctoral candidate at the Asia Research Centre, Murdoch University.
