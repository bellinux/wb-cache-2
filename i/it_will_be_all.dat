500|$|Austen {{wrote in}} her first {{surviving}} letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was [...] "very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man". She called him her [...] "friend" [...] and explained that on this account Cassandra must be anxious {{to know more about}} her new [...] "friend". Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote she expected an [...] "offer" [...] from her [...] "friend" [...] and that [...] "I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat", going on to write [...] "I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence" [...] and refuse all others. The next day, Austen wrote: [...] "The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea".|$|E
500|$|As soon as Starr {{arrived in}} Delhi he asked Evans {{to take him}} to a doctor because of a {{reaction}} to an inoculation: [...] "When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.' So off we go to pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right". Also there at the same time were Mia Farrow, her sister Prudence and brother John, Donovan, Gyp [...] "Gypsy Dave" [...] Mills, Mike Love, jazz flautist Paul Horn, journalist Lewis H. Lapham, film-maker Paul Saltzman, socialite Nancy Cooke de Herrera, actors Tom Simcox and Jerry Stovin, and dozens of others, all Europeans or Americans. Despite speculation, Shirley MacLaine did not attend and Lennon, who had thought of bringing Yoko Ono, decided against it.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the first}} episode, viewers complained on social {{networking}} websites after {{it appeared that}} pitch correction (which {{has been seen as}} controversial in the music industry) was used {{to improve the quality of}} some singers' voices, and forty-five viewers complained to Ofcom. Series producers claimed post-production work was necessary on the show because of the number of microphones used during filming: [...] "The judges make their decisions at the auditions stage based on what they hear on the day, live in the arena. The footage and sound is then edited and dubbed into a finished programme, to deliver the most entertaining experience possible for viewers. When it gets to the live shows, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> live." [...] It was reported on 26 August that Cowell had ordered a ban on pitch correction in future episodes, asking for them to be re-edited. In October 2010, Ofcom ruled that viewers had not been [...] "materially misled" [...] as pitch correction was only used during auditions and not when viewers were paying to vote for the contestants.|$|E

500|$|In mid October 2016, Waters {{announced}} that he would return to North America in 2017 with a pioneering new tour named [...] "Us + Them", stating: [...] "We {{are going to take a}} new show on the road, the content is very secret. It'll be a mixture of stuff from my long career, stuff from my years with Pink Floyd, some new things. Probably 75% of it will be old material and 25% will be new, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> connected by a general theme. It will be a cool show, I promise you. It'll be spectacular like all my shows have been." [...] It is intended that the 44-date Us + Them Tour would visit the United States and Canada, showcase Waters' highlights, start on 26 May 2017 in Kansas City, MO and end on 29 October 2017 in Vancouver, BC. The tour title is derived from the track [...] "Us and Them," [...] from the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{frustrating}} fans, {{it seemed}} as though ABC had seemingly removed all references to McClain and Dixie from their official All My Children website earlier that month, which further outraged fans. To this, McClain responded, [...] "I really am only the actor. I don't think they will ever bring me back, especially if they have removed the Dixie CHARACTER bio from the website," [...] McClain relayed. [...] "It's over. It's all done. AMC is going to become something totally different than it once was. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> new, all different. Why? I can only conjecture." [...] Thinking of her fellow actors, she later urged viewers not to give up on the show: [...] "Do not stop watching All My Children," [...] McClain stated. [...] "There are some good actors on that show, the producers are trying new and innovative things, and the writers are trying out lots of concepts and ideas that you may ultimately find very entertaining." ...|$|E
