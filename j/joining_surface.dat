30|$|Figure  11 c compares Pm for the {{different}} joint types with the Sikaforce® 7752. For this adhesive, the DLJ outperforms all other joint types by a significant amount. For this joint type, up to LO[*]=[*] 37.5  mm, the increase of Pm with LO is proportional. Above this value, the adherends’ plasticization limits the joint strength and the proportionality is cancelled. Since LO[*]=[*] 50  mm nearly reaches the failure strength of the aluminium adherends, no further LO increase is recommended with this adhesive. The other joint types showed identical results between them, with maximum Pm of[*]≈[*] 15  kN compared to Pm[*]≈[*] 24  kN for the DLJ. The identical behaviour between the SLJ, stepped-lap joints and scarf joints {{is caused by the}} extreme ductility of this adhesive, which manages to absorb practically all peak stresses. Under these conditions the scarf joint, which has the most convenient stress distributions (Figs.  9, 10) [40], excels only by a slight difference the SLJ and stepped-lap joint.

The effect of A 5052 ’s various surface states on the welding joining mechanism and mechanical properties were investigated. Friction spot welding was successfully applied for the dissimilar joining of PET thermoplastics and aluminum alloy A 5052. During FSW, the PET near the joining interface softened, partially melted and adhered to the A 5052 <b>joining</b> <b>surface.</b> The melted PET evaporated to form bubbles near the joining interface and cooled, forming hollows. The bubbles have two opposite effects: its presence at the joining interface prevent PET from contacting with A 5052, while bubbles or hollows are crack origins that induce crack paths which degrade the joining strength. On the other hand, the bubbles’ flow pushed the softened PET into irregularities on the roughened surface to form mechanical interlocking, which significantly improved the strength.

Nemes paper gives an analytical solution for the different stresses that appear on the three elements of the cylindrical assembly (two tubes and the adhesive) over the whole <b>joining</b> <b>surface.</b> A detailed study of this paper allowed us {{to develop a new}} mathematical model to be applied to a pin-and-collar specimen, in particular to the standard system, which appears in ISO 10123. From the mechanical and geometrical properties of the components and the axial loading applied on the system, it has been possible to obtain the intensity and distribution of stresses in the assembly graphically, using the mathematical program MathCAD. Consequently, it is possible to calculate the so far unknown value of maximum shear stress. So knowing the shear stress, the model allows (i) to predict the distribution of stresses in the adhesive bond and (ii) to carry out a parametric study of the bond; that is to say, it allows to evaluate the influence of geometrical parameters and the influence of the selected adhesive in the stress distribution within the bond. It is, therefore, a methodology, which will make possible to calculate, quickly and simply, the distribution of stresses and the maximum shear strength in the adhesive. Moreover, it makes unnecessary to carry out numerous mechanical tests. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{self-piercing}} riveting (SPR) method {{which uses a}} flange pipe rivet. This joining technology can {{solve the problems of}} oblique rivet and incorrect rivet position which are usually found in the SPR with a pipe rivet. The lap shear strength of the joint with a flange pipe rivet is higher than that of a joint with a conventional rivet. In this research, a flange pipe rivet was placed between two sheets with a force applied to the top sheet by a punch riveting machine. The flange pipe rivet moved downward along with the top sheet to induce appropriate bending and form a mechanical interlock in both sheets. Finite element (FE) analysis of the SPR with a flange pipe rivet was done by DEFORM software. The simulated joint cross-section shapes were observed, and the influence of the flange pipe rivet parameters on joint quality was analyzed. Simultaneously, some riveting experiments on joining aluminum sheets were conducted taking into consideration different rivet heights and chamfer angles. The results show that the <b>joining</b> <b>surface</b> is smooth and the simulated joint cross-section shapes are in good agreement with the experimental results.

40|$|Besides {{their high}} rating in macro-range {{industrial}} manufacturing processes, beam joining methods are also increasingly gaining in {{importance in the}} micro-system technology (MST). While the industry is already using the laser beam for <b>joining,</b> <b>surface</b> modifications or for structuring with different process variations, micro-range electron beam joining {{is still in the}} laboratory stage. The advantages of both technologies are especially the low thermal load on the components, the precise energy input, virtually no wear of the tools and the short access times. In the field of MST the possibility of the exact focussing on beam diameters of just a few micrometers is, above all, the most crucial characteristic which makes the micro-dimension application of those methods interesting. Moreover, both methods stand out for their specific technological properties. Electromagnetic coils allow the almost inertia-free movement of the electron beam. This allows extreme high-frequency oscillations which entail different advantages for welding. The electron beam is, in its function as carrier of electric charges which must be reduced from the component, most suitable for metal materials. The joining environment is a vacuum chamber which, to a high degree, protects the components against contamination and possible oxide formation. As it has the character of light, the laser radiation, on the other hand, is able to penetrate transparent materials and to convey its energy locally into lower layers. This effect may be used in order to produce positive substance joints of two components at their contact area. In connection with the assembly of hybrid micro-systems, the process characteristics of electron beam and laser beam joining are considered within the scope of SFB 440 (special research area) (4 partial projects).
