25|$|Components {{are called}} by {{assigning}} their calls to named component instances. Names cannot be re-used {{within a single}} workflow. There are special components for input files that include <b>external</b> <b>files</b> to the script. Supported atomic types are integer, float, boolean and string, and typing is done implicitly.|$|E
25|$|AcroForms {{can keep}} form field values in {{external}} stand-alone files containing key:value pairs. The <b>external</b> <b>files</b> may use Forms Data Format (FDF) and XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) files. The usage rights (UR) signatures define rights for import form data files in FDF, XFDF and text (CSV/TSV) formats, and export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats.|$|E

2500|$|A Gerber file {{contains}} the complete {{description of a}} PCB layer image without requiring any <b>external</b> <b>files.</b> It has all the imaging operators needed for a PCB image. Any aperture shape can be defined. Planes and pads can be specified without the need to paint or vector-fill as in Standard Gerber. (However some implementations still use painting, problematical for the users of those files.) ...|$|E
5000|$|... @file nodes {{represent}} <b>external</b> <b>files,</b> {{files on}} the computer's file system {{other than the}} outline file. When saving an outline Leo automatically writes all changed @file trees back to the <b>external</b> <b>files.</b> Comments, called sentinel lines, in <b>external</b> <b>files</b> represent the outline structure. When Leo reads an outline, these comments allow Leo to recreate @file trees using only the data in the external file. @auto nodes represent <b>external</b> <b>files</b> without using sentinel comments. When reading @auto nodes, Leo uses the program structure of the external file to create the @auto tree.|$|E
5000|$|The second new {{mechanism}} is [...] "path randomization", which executes application bundles from a random, hidden path and {{prevents them from}} accessing <b>external</b> <b>files</b> relative to their location. To avoid this, the developer has to distribute the application bundle and its <b>external</b> <b>files</b> on a signed disk image or in a signed installer package. The user can avoid this mechanism by moving the application bundle without its <b>external</b> <b>files</b> to a new location.|$|E

30|$|When {{the system}} is capable of {{performing}} a test and a user introduces the desired tilt angle into the appropriate software input box, the system will automatically adjust the tilt of the photovoltaic panel to the desired angle. This procedure can be seen live from the web camera which displays the experimentation setup. After the test is completed, the experimental characteristic P–I curve is displayed {{on the screen and}} an <b>external</b> <b>file</b> containing the output data is generated. The user can process the data from the <b>external</b> <b>file</b> and calculate the maximum power for the given operating conditions by using Eq. (3).|$|R
50|$|In September 2015, {{security}} researcher Patrick Wardle {{wrote about}} another shortcoming that concerns applications that are distributed with <b>external</b> <b>files,</b> such as libraries or even HTML files that can contain JavaScript. An attacker can manipulate those files and through them exploit a vulnerability in the signed application. The application and its <b>external</b> <b>files</b> {{can then be}} redistributed, while leaving the original signature of the application bundle itself intact. As Gatekeeper does not verify such individual files, the security can be compromised. With path randomization and signed disk images, Apple provided mechanisms to mitigate this issue in macOS Sierra.|$|E

50|$|The {{first new}} {{mechanism}} allows developers to code-sign disk images {{that can be}} verified as a unit by the system. This allows developers to guarantee the integrity of <b>external</b> <b>files</b> that are distributed alongside the application bundle on the same disk image. An attacker could infect these <b>external</b> <b>files</b> with malicious code and with them exploit a vulnerability in the application, without having to break the signature of the application bundle itself. By signing the disk image, the developer can prevent tampering and force an attacker to repackage the files onto a new disk image, requiring a valid developer certificate to pass Gatekeeper without a warning.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike predecessors, RPG III uses <b>external</b> <b>file</b> descriptions, {{which means}} that disk files are built and RPG III {{programs}} are attached to them at compile time. Some other noteworthy changes from RPG II include: ...|$|R
5000|$|Cryptographic {{signatures}} : Every changeset {{is stored}} with a hash to prevent accidental corruption. Using an <b>external</b> <b>file</b> signing program (such as GnuPG or another PGP client), these hashes can also optionally be signed, preventing unauthorized modification if the archive is compromised.|$|R
5000|$|Keywords {{are stored}} with the {{pictures}} (using IPTC metadata), making their exchange easier: When sending a picture, its associated keywords are also sent. This method of storing information offers a certain durability of data since keywords are {{not dependent on}} an <b>external</b> <b>file.</b>|$|R
50|$|To use {{machine-readable}} terms {{from any}} controlled vocabulary, web designers {{can choose from}} a variety of annotation formats, including RDFa, HTML5 Microdata, or JSON-LD in the markup, or RDF serializations (RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, TriG, TriX) in <b>external</b> <b>files.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fortran is case-insensitive. The {{convention}} of writing Fortran keywords in upper case {{and all other}} names in lower case is adopted in this article; except, by way of contrast, in the input/output descriptions (Data transfer and Operations on <b>external</b> <b>files).</b>|$|E

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the title compound, hexa-μ 2 -bromido-μ 4 -oxido-tetra­kis­[(diethyl ether) magnesium], [Mg 4 Br 6 O(C 4 H 10 O) 4], determined from data measured at 173  K, differs from the previously known structure of diethyl ether magnesium oxybromide, which was determined from room-temperature data [Stucky & Rundle (1964 [triangle]). J. Am. Chem. Soc. 86, 4821 – 4825]. The title compound crystallizes in the tetra­gonal space group I An <b>external</b> <b>file</b> that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is e- 67 -m 1614 -efi 7. jpg, whereas the previously known structure crystallizes in a different tetra­gonal space group, namely P An <b>external</b> <b>file</b> that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is e- 67 -m 1614 -efi 7. jpg 21 c. Both molecules have crystallographic An <b>external</b> <b>file</b> that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is e- 67 -m 1614 -efi 7. jpg symmetry and show almost identical geometric parameters for the Mg, Br and O atoms. The crystal of the title compound {{turned out to be}} a merohedral twin emulating a structure with apparent Laue symmetry 4 /mmm, whereas the correct Laue group is just 4 /m.

5000|$|The GEDCOM {{standard}} {{supports the}} inclusion of multimedia objects (for example, photos of individuals). [...] Such multimedia objects can be either included in the GEDCOM file itself (called the [...] "embedded form") or in an <b>external</b> <b>file</b> where {{the name of the}} <b>external</b> <b>file</b> is specified in the GEDCOM file (called the [...] "linked form"). Embedding multimedia directly in the GEDCOM file makes transmission of data easier, in that all of the information (including the multimedia data) is in one file, but the resulting file can be enormous. Linking multimedia keeps the size of the GEDCOM file under control, but then when transmitting the file, the multimedia objects must either be transmitted separately or archived together with the GEDCOM into one larger file. Support for embedding media directly was dropped in the draft 5.5.1 standard.|$|R
5000|$|Palm OS 4.0 was {{released}} {{with the new}} Palm m500 series on March 19, 2003. [...] This version adds a standard interface for <b>external</b> <b>file</b> system access (such as SD cards). <b>External</b> <b>file</b> systems are a radical change to the operating system's previous in-place execution. Now, application code and data need to be loaded into the device's RAM, similar to desktop operating system behavior. A new Universal Connector with USB support is introduced. The previous optional Mobile Internet Kit {{is now part of}} the operating system. Version 4.0 adds an attention manager to coordinate information from different applications, with several possibilities to get the user's attention, including sound, LED blinking or vibration. 16-bit color screens and different time zones are supported. This version also has security and UI enhancements.|$|R
