5000|$|In the <b>first</b> <b>processors</b> that {{supported}} PAE, support for larger physical addresses {{is evident in}} their package pinout, with address pin designations going up to A35 instead of stopping at A31. Later processor families use interconnects such as Hypertransport or QuickPath Interconnect, which lack dedicated memory address signals, so this relationship is less apparent.|$|R
