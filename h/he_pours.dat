5|$|The god Vishnu and his consorts Lakshmi and Bhudevi {{should be}} {{represented}} as taking {{the place of}} Parvati's parents in the ceremony. The four-armed Vishnu should be shown in the background in between Shiva and Parvati; {{in one of his}} front hands is a golden pot from which <b>he</b> <b>pours</b> water over the hands of the couple, symbolizing giving away the bride to the groom. He holds his usual attributes, the sudarshana chakra (discus) and a shankha (conch), in his back arms. Vishnu's wives, dressed in royal finery, stand behind Parvati and hold her waist, symbolizing the handing over.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} clones are then {{seen in a}} forest – one walks behind a tree and reappears dressed in casual attire. He climbs another tree and {{ends up in the}} {{bathroom}} of the woman's apartment, where he retrieves a package. The clone then crawls underneath her bed and finds himself underneath a car. He opens the package and finds a gasoline can, which <b>he</b> <b>pours</b> into a compartment located behind the car's license plate. All three clones enter the car and drive to the box, which they step back into; the video concludes with the box's explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{ritual is}} {{the central part of}} the celebration. Vespers vary from place to place with respect to the time of the {{beginning}} of the service, its length and structure. The laying of badnjak on the fire usually comes after the service, and is done by a priest or by a respected parishioner. Before the burning, the tree may be processionally carried around the church. In the case of more than one badnjak, the trees are placed in the shape of a cross. The assembled devotees throw then into the fire their twig bunches, each representing a small badnjak. The consecration or blessing is performed by a priest: he strews wheat grains over the badnjak, censes it while singing the Troparion of the Nativity, and as he intones prayers, <b>he</b> <b>pours</b> wine and spreads honey on it. Instead of applying wine and honey, holy water may be sprinkled on the tree by dipping a bunch of basil into a bowl with the water. This rite is generally performed after the placing on the fire, although it may happen before, in which case the consecration may be performed in the church itself or in its yard.|$|E

5|$|The video {{progresses}} as Carey, now on {{the streets}} of New York, is walking towards the hotel. As she begins to notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins jolting back to the hotel while holding several shopping bags. Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights around a large photo of her. As the video comes to an end, she waits for her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting to take a picture of her. She then looks directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting to take a picture, right before a bus hits him. Carey gasps in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table. As Gucci Mane stands next to her in a white suit, <b>he</b> <b>pours</b> her champagne and hands her the glass.|$|E
25|$|The {{oil that}} is used to anoint the catechumens before baptism is simple olive oil which is blessed by the priest {{immediately}} before <b>he</b> <b>pours</b> it into the baptismal font. Then, using his fingers, he takes some of the blessed oil floating {{on the surface of the}} baptismal water and anoints the catechumen on the forehead, breast, shoulders, ears, hands, and feet. He then immediately baptizes the catechumen with threefold immersion in the name of the Trinity.|$|E
25|$|Three months later, Delaney goes to see Zack, who {{has moved}} on to an {{exterior}} concessions job at Mellon Arena during Pittsburgh Penguins games. Delaney convinces {{him to come to}} Delaney's home to see the unfinished film and help complete it. Zack agrees, and as Delaney and the cameraman Deacon explain, Zack learns that Miri never filmed her sex scene with Lester. Zack goes to Miri's apartment and reveals to her that he never slept with Stacey; instead, they talked about Miri all night. <b>He</b> <b>pours</b> his heart out to Miri, proclaiming his love for her, which she reciprocates.|$|E

25|$|Development {{arrives in}} Ilmorog as the {{government}} begin to build the Trans-Africa road through the village, which brings an increase in trade. Karega returns to Ilmorog, telling of his slow spiral into alcoholism before finally securing work in a factory. After getting fired from the factory, he returns to Ilmorog. The change in Ilmorog is rapid, and the villages changes into the town of New Ilmorog. The farmers are told that they should fence off their land and mortgage parts of it {{to ensure that they}} own a finite area. They are offered loans which are linked to their harvest turnout to pay for this expense. Nyakinyua dies and the banks move to take her land. To prevent this Wanja sells her business and buys Nyakinyua's land. She opens up a successful brothel in the town, and is herself one of the prostitutes. Munira goes to see her to attempt to rekindle their romance, but is met with only a demand for money. He pays, and the couple have sex. Karega goes to see Wanja who both still have strong feelings for each other, but after disagreeing about how to live he leaves. Wanja plans to separate herself finally from the men who have exploited her during her life, wanting to bring them to her brothel with all of her prostitutes sent away so that she could present the downtrodden but noble Abdulla as her chosen partner. Meanwhile, Munira is watching the brothel, and sees Karega arrive, and then leave. In a religious fervour, <b>he</b> <b>pours</b> petrol on the brothel, sets it alight, and retreats to a hill to watch it burn. Wanja escapes but is hospitalized due to smoke inhalation; the other men Wanja had invited died in the fire. Munira is sentenced with arson; later, Karega learns that the corrupt local MP was gunned down in his car whilst waiting for his chauffeur in Nairobi.|$|E
500|$|Doggett {{manages to}} trick and subdue Tommy by pretending {{to set the}} house on fire. [...] <b>He</b> <b>pours</b> a {{canister}} of water {{all over the floor}} and furniture, acting as if it is gasoline. [...] However, because Tommy believes it to be real, he sees Doggett pouring gasoline and lighting a match, and sees flames burn in the living room. [...] Tommy passes out in fear. [...] Tommy is eventually transported to a psychiatric ward, where his imagination is stifled by watching several televisions all at the same time.|$|E
500|$|The four {{movements}} (2,3,5 and 6) placed symmetrically {{around the}} central New Testament {{passage in the}} fourth movement, are all settings of Madrigal-style verse. The second movement is a setting of a lengthy text beginning [...] "" [...] (The Lord provides: <b>He</b> <b>pours</b> his riches down on us; without this nothing here on earth would flourish). Bach set it as an unadorned secco recitative, without arioso episodes, accompanied by bare sustained notes in the continuo. The bass soloist proclaims that God's abundant gifts should be shared with the poor and lowly; and that consideration for the needy, not wealth used for tributes, will find favour with God.|$|E

500|$|Homer {{is invited}} to speak his mind on a popular cable news show called Head Butt, on which host Nash Castor and {{commentator}} Adriatica Vel Johnson argue that he will soon be forgotten. However, Homer makes a convincing rant in which he tells the viewers that unlike television [...] such as Nash and Adriatica, he speaks for the common man. When the show is over, the cable network executives give Homer his own television show called Gut Check with Homer Simpson, where he provides a mix of populist and conservative ideas. During one episode, <b>he</b> <b>pours</b> [...] "gravy of freedom" [...] over a steak shaped like America, using the gravy {{as a metaphor for}} the things that make the country great. He then encourages his viewers to [...] "get on the boat" [...] to protest about the bad things in society, and proceeds to place a gravy boat on his head. This wins Homer a huge base of support among average Americans, and soon the [...] "gravy boat movement" [...] becomes popular throughout the country.|$|E
500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{decides to}} propose to Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), and runs into trouble {{thinking}} {{of how to}} do it in the most elaborate way possible with his expensive diamond ring (which cost what he believes is the traditional [...] "three years' salary"). <b>He</b> <b>pours</b> gasoline in the parking lot in the shape of letters, planning to light them on fire and show it to Holly. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) stops it and gathers a meeting of Michael, herself, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez). They believe Holly truly is [...] "the one" [...] for him and give him anecdotes and ideas. He calls Holly's father to ask his permission (although he leaves a message rather than speak to him personally). Holly catches onto the idea when she calls her parents herself, but she notices her parents seem mentally disoriented. She talks to Michael later and says she wants to move back to Colorado to be there for her dad, and Michael supports her decision.|$|E
500|$|While Deangelo gets {{annoyed with}} Jim and Pam, {{he loves the}} antics of Andy, who has resorted to {{physical}} comedy when his jokes fall flat, {{getting to the point}} where <b>he</b> <b>pours</b> hot coffee on his pants and (at Deangelo's urging) eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that [...] "this is my life now". Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the [...] "multipurpose room", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.|$|E

500|$|The Supreme is also {{revealed}} to be power-crazed in other ways. Michiko Kakutani writes [...] "Francia, it seems, wants to account for everything (his own history, {{as well as the}} history of his nation, which he personifies as its leader) as <b>he</b> <b>pours</b> out his story, it becomes clear that he possesses an insatiable desire for power and control—he has even chained a huge meteorite to his desk, as punishment for being a cosmic runaway—and that he also sees himself as two separate beings: as a conniving, paranoiac [...] "I", beset by the average ego's fears and doubts, and as the [...] "Supreme", a monstrously powerful presence that even Francia himself must refer to in the third person." [...] The Supreme was personally involved in the affairs of the state to such extent, that it was reported by contemporary press that [...] " [...] personally trained his cavalry {{in the use of the}} saber, ascertained the exact number of nails in Fort Orange, awarded 102 pesos to a Frenchman whose anchor had been melted down by the state... lowered the price of salt in the capital, donated state yerba to the people of Saladillo, and denied permission for [...] to marry in Villa Rica." [...] It was common for him to attend to such specific details in a single evening.|$|E

2500|$|During the Han dynasty Taiyi {{was adopted}} into the {{imperial}} cult, {{and at the}} same time absorbed to some degree into Taoism and identifies as the Dào 道. The [...] "Inscription for Laozi" [...] (Laozi ming), a Han stela, describes the Taiyi as the source of inspiration and immortality for Laozi. In the Han apocryphal texts weishu the Big Dipper is described as the instrument of Taiyi, the ladle through which <b>he</b> <b>pours</b> out the primordial breath (yuanqi) and as his heavenly chariot.|$|E

2500|$|Her soul becomes {{trapped in}} the vial in which <b>he</b> <b>pours</b> the last drops of this substance, and he in turn is tormented by the {{presence}} he sees as a small, tortured woman within the vial. She is, however, able to take over his body with her soul long enough to write the confession from which the above excerpts come. This saves Mr. Sands from capital punishment, but {{he notes that the}} last pages of his journal were “written... after I was discharged from Bloomingdale Insane Asylum.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "A Canadian Moment", {{featuring}} the entire cast as regulars {{in a coffee}} shop.

This was the final sketch in the New Year's Eve grand finale in which the coffee shop owner, played by Broadfoot, closes the donut shop permanently and kicks out the regulars at closing time.|$|E
2500|$|Pattinson executively {{produced}} {{and starred in}} the film Remember Me, which was released on 12 March 2010. Though the film received mixed reviews, some critics praised his performance. Jake Coyle of The Associated Press said that [...] "The young actor has an unmistakable screen presence. However in Remember Me, <b>he</b> <b>pours</b> it on thickly and self-consciously. With low eyes, sleeves rolled up just so and cigarette drooping artfully from his mouth, Tyler (like Edward Cullen) is a reluctant romantic." [...] Ian Nathan of Empire Online stated that [...] "this {{is the best thing}} he's done."
