40|$|Abstract. Chatter {{vibration}} {{in cutting}} processes usually leads to surface finish degradation, tool damage, cutting noise, energy loss, etc. Self-excited vibration particularly {{seems to be}} a problem that is easily increased to large vibration. The regenerative effect is considered as one of the causes of chatter vibration. Although the chatter vibration occurs in various types of processing, the end-milling is a typical process that seems to cause the chatter vibration {{due to a lack of}} rigidity of one or more parts of the machine tools, cutting tool, and work-piece. The aim of our research is to propose a simple method to control chatter vibration of the end-milling process on the basis of a coupling model integrating the related various elements. In this study, <b>hammering</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out to measure the transfer function of a machine tool and cutting tool system, which seems to cause vibration. By comparing these results, finite elemental method (FEM) analysis models were constructed. Additionally, cutting experiments were carried out to confirm the chatter vibration frequencies in end-milling with a machining center. In the <b>hammering</b> <b>tests,</b> impulse <b>hammer</b> and multiple acceleration pick-ups are connected to a multi-channel FFT analyzer and estimate the natural frequencies and natural vibration modes. A simplified FEM model is proposed by circular section stepped beam elements on the basis of the <b>hammering</b> <b>test</b> results, considering a coupling effect. In comparisons of the calculated results and <b>hammering</b> <b>test</b> results, the vibration modes are in good agreement. As a result, the proposed model accurately predicts the chatter vibration considering several effects among the relating elements in end-milling. Moreover, it can be seen that the chatter vibration is investigated from a viewpoint of the integrating model of the end-milling process...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} discriminating a {{property}} {{of an object}} {{with the use of}} generated sound when striking it with a hammer is called a <b>hammering</b> <b>test.</b> This method, however, depends on human experience and skills.

In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a <b>hammering</b> <b>test</b> system consisting of a computer and a video camera, through which image and sound signals of a hammering scene are acquired.

50|$|An ideal {{impact to}} a {{structure}} {{is a perfect}} impulse, which has an infinitely small duration, causing a constant amplitude in the frequency domain; this would result in all modes of vibration being excited with equal energy. The impact <b>hammer</b> <b>test</b> is designed to replicate this; however, in reality a hammer strike cannot last for an infinitely small duration, but has a known contact time. The duration of the contact time directly influences the frequency content of the force, with a larger contact time causing a smaller range of bandwidth. A load cell {{is attached to the}} end of the hammer to record the force. Impact hammer testing is ideal for small light weight structures; however as the size of the structure increases issues can occur due to a poor signal to noise ratio. This is common on large civil engineering structures.|$|E

The Schmidt <b>Hammer</b> <b>test</b> is based on the assumption that there is a mutual relation between the degree of weathering of a particular surface and the duration of its exposure. Information about the degree of weathering is expressed by the rebound value (R value). With increasing weathering of a surface the mean R value decreases.

Principles, conditions and limitations of the Schmidt <b>Hammer</b> <b>test</b> in glacigenous environment were characterized according to the literature.

According to the results of statistical analyses, the R value significantly correlates with the altitude and climatic characteristics (mean annual air temperature, mean annual amount of precipitation).
