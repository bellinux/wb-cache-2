5|$|A few {{physicists}} {{persisted in}} developing semiclassical models in which electromagnetic radiation is not quantized, but matter appears {{to obey the}} laws of quantum mechanics. Although the evidence from chemical and physical experiments <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> of photons was overwhelming by the 1970s, this evidence could not be considered as absolutely definitive; since it relied on the interaction of light with matter, and a sufficiently complete theory of matter could in principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, all semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation experiments. Hence, Einstein's hypothesis that quantization is a property of light itself {{is considered to be}} proven.|$|E

5|$|Chrysippus {{also argued}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> of fate based on divination, which {{he thought there}} was good {{evidence}} for.

There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity. To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and intelligent design. In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E
