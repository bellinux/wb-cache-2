5|$|Another {{criticism}} is that outcomes {{are presented in}} terms of relative risk reduction to exaggerate the apparent benefits of the treatment. For example, he writes, if four people out of 1,000 will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack within the year, but on statins only two will, that is a 50 percent reduction if expressed as relative risk reduction. But if expressed as absolute risk reduction, it is a reduction of just 0.2 percent.|$|E
5|$|Calleia {{began his}} stage career on Armistice Day. After World War I he found only limited success in vaudeville. He earned his living stoking the furnace at a {{department}} store, {{and got a}} night job washing and repairing New York City streetcars. By day he haunted theatrical booking offices. The Henry W. Savage agency sent Calleia to Denver, where he made his stage debut singing in the chorus of the musical comedy, <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Heart.</b> The following season he had a bit part in Pietro (1920), an Otis Skinner vehicle that played six weeks on Broadway and 40 weeks on tour. Calleia supplemented his salary by working as assistant stage manager and repairing trunks at $3 each.|$|E
5|$|Jack is livid {{when his}} mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch), visits {{him when she}} is in town to attend his ex-wife Bianca's (Isabella Rossellini) wedding to Vincent Folley. Colleen takes an {{immediate}} dislike to Jack's fiancée, Phoebe, but takes a liking to Liz, whom she originally mistakes for Phoebe. The stress of his approaching wedding {{and the arrival of}} his mother prompt Jack to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack.

5|$|Studies <b>have</b> {{not found}} <b>an</b> overall benefit {{in the general}} {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack or stroke in the past. One study found that among those who <b>have</b> never <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from <b>having</b> <b>a</b> non-fatal <b>heart</b> attack or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> non-fatal bleeding event.

The test of the hypothesis consists of administering the drug to half of the people in a study group as a controlled experiment. If the data show a statistically significant change in the people receiving the drug, the null hypothesis is rejected.|$|R
5|$|Next, Cuvier {{identifies}} the taxonomic {{divisions of the}} group, in this case four orders of reptiles, the chelonians (tortoises and turtles), saurians (lizards), ophidians (snakes) and batracians (amphibians, now considered a separate class of vertebrates), describing each group in a single sentence. Thus the batracians are said to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> with a single atrium, a naked body (with no scales), and to pass with age from being fish-like to being like a quadruped or biped.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, 2006 Dave Meltzer {{reported}} that Eaton was hospitalized {{after suffering a}} heart attack.

Since then, he has suffered with several health issues, especially cardiac problems which have seen him hospitalized on several occasions. In June 2013, Eaton underwent successful surgery to have a pacemaker inserted.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E

The Huntsman was hired by the Evil Queen to remove Snow White's heart and bring it back to her, but when he does not do so, she removes his heart. Graham later attempts to explain to Emma that he could not feel anything with Regina because he does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart.</b> Graham and Emma then encounter the wolf from Graham's visions, and follow it to a graveyard and vault marked with a symbol Graham saw in his visions and in Henry's book.

5|$|The storyline {{also saw}} Franks film scenes {{alongside}} Steve McFadden, who plays Phil Mitchell, {{for the first}} time since their controversial drugs storyline in 2010. Ian told Phil about Rainie's blackmail, and Phil took Rainie to the allotments to 'deal with her'. He later told Ian that she would not be a 'problem' any longer, leaving Ian fearful of what lengths Phil had gone to. Phil was later revealed to have set Rainie up in a flat, but when his fiance Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) discovered what he was doing she ordered him to let Rainie go as she was not his problem. As a result, he abandoned Rainie on Cora's doorstep, where Rainie promises to get clean with Cora's help. Ian's actions were revealed when Rainie, depressed after a confrontation with Mick Carter and his family, told Denise about their night together. Cora and Rainie <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> to heart, but when Cora heads out for a short time, she returns and find Rainie gone along with her purse.|$|E

When the pair see restaurant Il Gnosh on fire, Gilly rings for help whilst Steph runs into the burning building to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) and her children. Gilly stands on a ladder outside and begs her to come out, however she tells him she's ready to die and walks back into the flames. Gilly deals with his grief by becoming angry that Steph has 'left' him. After Rhys tries to comfort him, Gilly goes into Steph's room and trashes it after seeing that she has still kept her photo of her and Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) on their wedding day, placed on a table. Gilly argues with Steph's family as they blame him for not saving her and disagree on the funeral arrangements. Frankie then tells him that Steph had never loved him and that Max would have done anything to save Steph from the fire, making him further deeply upset and angry. He starts drinking heavily, causing trouble on many occasions.|$|E

5|$|The NGC 4038 Group is a {{group of}} galaxies across Corvus and Crater. The group may contain between 13 and 27 galaxies. The best-known member is the Antennae {{peculiar}} galaxy, located 0.25 north of 31 Crateris. It consists of two interacting galaxies—NGC 4038 and 4039—that appear to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> shape as seen from Earth. The name originates from the huge tidal tails that come off the ends of the two galaxies, formed because of the spiral galaxies' original rotation. Both original galaxies were spiral galaxies and are now experiencing extensive star formation due to the interaction of gas clouds. The galaxies are 45 million light-years from Earth and each has multiple ultraluminous X-ray sources, the source of which is unknown. Astronomers theorize that they may be a rare type of x-ray emitting binary stars or intermediate-mass black holes. The Antennae Galaxies appear in a telescope at the 10th magnitude. SN 2004gt was a type Ic supernova that erupted on December 12, 2004. The progenitor was not identified from older images of the galaxy, and is either a type WC Wolf–Rayet star with a mass over 40 times that of the Sun, or a star 20 to 40 times as massive as the Sun in a binary star system. SN 2007sr was a Type Ia supernova event that peaked in brightness on December 14, 2007. The galaxy has been identified as a good place to take detailed images in case of further supernovae.|$|E

At Judgment Day, JBL defeated Guerrero via disqualification in a match for the WWE title. A title cannot change hands by disqualification, so Guerrero retained the title. JBL controversially won his sole world championship, the WWE Championship from Guerrero in a Texas Bull Rope match at The Great American Bash. The initial decision of Guerrero's victory was reversed by then-General Manager Kurt Angle, awarding the match and the title to JBL; the replay showed that JBL touched the fourth corner before Guerrero. JBL won a rematch in a steel cage two weeks later, again with Angle's assistance.|$|E
25|$|People {{with higher}} levels of vitamin D tend to have lower rates of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke and tend to have lower blood pressure. However, it has been found that vitamin D supplementation does not improve {{cardiovascular}} health or metabolism, so the link with vitamin D must be in part indirect. People who get more sun are generally healthier, and also have higher vitamin D levels. It has been found that ultraviolet radiation (even UVA) produces nitric oxide (NO) in the skin, and nitric oxide can lower blood pressure. High blood pressure increases the risk of stroke and heart disease. Although long-term exposure to ultraviolet contributes to non-melanoma skin cancers that are rarely fatal, it has been found in a Danish study that those who get these cancers were less likely to die during the study, and were much less likely to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack, {{than those who did not}} have these cancers.|$|E
