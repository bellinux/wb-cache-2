Bt plants {{are known to}} affect some above-ground invertebrates, with significant effects on species closely related to target invertebrates and on their natural enemies. Bt proteins may enter the soil through root exudates and decomposition of plant material. This study aimed to analyse the effects of Bt broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica Plenk) on six soil-dwelling invertebrates. No significant differences were detected in nematode (Panagrellus redivivus L.) populations living in compost in which Bt and non- 5 / broccoli had grown. The other species were introduced to combinations of Bt and non- 5 / leaves, and compost in which Bt and non- 5 / plants had grown. No differences were detected in Collembola (Folsomia candida Willem) populations, but significantly more young woodlice (Porcellio scaber Latrielle) survived, and weighed more, in the Bt than the non- 5 / treatments. Slugs (Deroceras reticulatum Muller) weighed more {{in the presence of}} Bt proteins. A higher percentage of earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris L.) cocoons hatched in Bt than non- 5 / treatments. In contrast, at a third trophic level, fewer predatory beetles (Nebria brevicollis Fabricius) survived when feeding on slugs that had fed on Bt leaves than on those fed on non- 5 / leaves. Leaves from Bt plants affected more parameters than compost in which Bt plants had grown. Attempts were made to use molecular techniques to analyse the effects of Bt broccoli on soil micro-organisms. Individual Bt broccoli plants expressed different concentrations of Bt protein. The Bt plant's control of three Lepidoptera species was tested and only one species was susceptible. These results show that non-target invertebrates, including pest species, can be affected by Bt broccoli, sometimes beneficially, and underlines the need for prior testing of GM crops on a range of non-target species.

Dicha cepa se puede tratar con exposiciones a bajas temperaturas dando lugar a un incremento de sus efectos entomopat??genos. La cepa en su totalidad, o sus estructuras cristalinas, ya haya sido tratada o no por el m??todo de la invenci??n, pueden ser utilizadas bien directamente para el control biol??gico de plagas, bien para la producci??n de bioinsecticidas que ayuden a ese control. La presente invenci??n tambi??n se refiere a las prote??nas entomopat??genas, as?? como a los pl??smidos presentes en la cepa. Tambi??n se refiere al uso de la cepa para la producci??n de enzimas de inter??s industrial. The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a novel bacterial strain of Bacillus pumilus (CECT 7462 or B. pumilus TCC). Said strain {{can be treated}} with exposure to low temperatures {{in order to increase}} the entomopathogenic effects thereof. The invention also relates to compositions that include the original strain or the strain treated using the method of the invention and/or the crystalline structures thereof and to the uses of same for biological pest control and for the production of bioinsecticides. The invention further relates to any plasmid which can be obtained from the strain and which contains nucleotide sequences, or to the sequences per se, which give rise to <b>entomopathogenic</b> <b>proteins,</b> {{as well as to the}} use of the strain for the production of enzymes suitable for industrial use...|$|R

Com o objetivo de se determinar a atividade biológica das proteínas constituintes do cristal foi feita a clonagem {{molecular}} dos genes da toxina. A estratégia de clonagem consistiu-se na inserção de fragmentos de DNA plasmidial de B. thuringiensis subsp israelensis no plasmídio pUC 8, resultando em plasmídios híbridos. Foram obtidos 8 clones recombinantes com atividade contra larvas de ª fluviatilis e hemolíticos para eritrócitos de carneiros e um clone recombinante com atividade larvicida e não hemolítico. Após análise imunológica com anticorpos produzidos contra as principais frações protéicas de B. thuringiensis subsp israelensis, verificou-se a produção dos peptídeos de 28, 33 e 38 kD nos clones recombinantes larvicidas e hemolíticos e a ausência do peptídeo de 33 kD no clone não hemolíticoBacillus thuringiensis subsp. Isralensis is a bacteria <b>entomopathogenic</b> {{that produce}} <b>proteins</b> crystals {{during the process}} of sporulation. The molecular cloning of the toxin genes was carried out to determine the biological activities of the crystal proteins. Fragments of DNA plasmids of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. Israelensis coli were inserted in the vector pUC 8 and cells of Escherichia coli were transformed with the hybrid plasmids. Eight of the recombinants obtained were active against larvae of A. fluviatilis and hemolytic for sheep red blood cells, while one of the recombinants showed larvicidal activity but did not show hemolytic activity. Antibodies were produced against the major proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis crystal and the immunodection test showed the presence of three types of proteins with 28, 33 and 38 kD, respectively. While the clones with IarvicidaI and hemolytic activity contained all three types of proteins, the one with no hemolytic activity lacked the 33 kD protei...|$|R
