25|$|In most cases, <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> become {{available}} after the patent protections afforded to a drug's original developer expire. Once generic drugs enter the market, competition {{often leads to}} substantially lower prices for both the original brand-name product and its generic equivalents. In most countries, patents give 20 years of protection. However, many countries and regions, such as the European Union and the United States, may grant {{up to five years}} of additional protection ("patent term restoration") if manufacturers meet specific goals, such as conducting clinical trials for pediatric patients. Manufacturers, wholesalers, insurers, and drugstores can each increase prices at various stages of production and distribution.|$|E

The core items are deemed {{to be the most}} cost effective options for key health problems and are usable with little additional health care resources. The complementary items either require additional infrastructure such as specially trained health care providers or diagnostic equipment or have a lower cost-benefit ratio. About 25% of items are in the complementary list. Some medications are listed as both core and complementary. While most medications on the list are available as <b>generic</b> <b>products,</b> being under patent does not exclude inclusion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Mandatory generic {{substitution}} (GS) {{was introduced}} in Finland on 1 April 2003. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore and compare the impacts of GS on the activities of pharmaceutical companies representing mainly original or <b>generic</b> pharmaceutical <b>products</b> in Finland. The self-reported impact of GS from pharmaceutical companies' perspective was explored with a focus on the number of employees, the range of sales packages on the market, the marketing activities, the research and development of new pharmaceutical products and storage of pharmaceuticals. Methods A cross-sectional postal survey was conducted among pharmaceutical companies with an office in Finland and substitutable medicines in the Finnish pharmaceutical market one year (2004) and five years (2008) after the introduction of GS. Completed questionnaires were returned by 16 original and 7 <b>generic</b> <b>product</b> companies in 2004 (response rate 56 %, n = 41) and by 16 original and 6 <b>generic</b> <b>product</b> companies in 2008 (response rate 56 %, n = 39). Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Results The number of employees (2004 : n = 6 / 16, 2008 : n = 7 / 16) and the amount of prescription medicine marketing (2004 : n = 7 / 16, 2008 : n = 8 / 16) decreased in many of the original product companies after the introduction of GS. GS resulted in problems related to the storage of pharmaceuticals in the original product companies shortly after GS was introduced (p = 0. 032 between 2004 and 2008). In the <b>generic</b> <b>product</b> companies, the prescription medicine representatives' visits to pharmacies increased at the beginning of GS (p = 0. 021 between 2004 and 2008). In addition, GS caused problems with the storage of pharmaceuticals one year and five years after the reform (2004 : n = 4 / 7, 2008 : n = 3 / 6). The differences between original and <b>generic</b> <b>product</b> companies regarding the impacts of GS were not, however, statistically significant. GS did not affect on the range of sales packages on the market or the research activities of the majority of companies. Conclusions The study suggests that GS has had impacts on the activities of pharmaceutical companies in Finland. There were also some differences, although not statistically significant, between the surveyed original and <b>generic</b> <b>product</b> companies regarding the self-reported impacts of GS. More investigations are needed in this field. </p...|$|R
