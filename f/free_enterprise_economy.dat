50|$|As a {{progressive}} advocate of internationalism, Yu Kil-chun believed {{the process of}} enlightenment could take only two directions in Korea. One way would slavishly imitate the methods of others without first understanding {{the context in which}} those methods had developed. The second way, the way Yu hoped would be followed, involved first perceiving the ways of the West and then adapting them to the realities of Korea, much like the path taken by Japan. Yu proceeded to develop a plan for political and economic reform in Korea based on this approach. His ultimate objective was to establish a constitutional democracy and create a <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> capitalist <b>economy.</b>|$|R

40|$|I {{study the}} role of {{auditing}} in mitigating agency concerns in family firms. Family firms face less severe agency problems due to the separation of ownership and control (Type 1) but more severe agency problems between controlling and noncontrolling shareholders (Type 2). As family firms make up {{a large part of}} most <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>economies</b> it is important to examine these two agency problems with respect to auditor choice and audit effort. I find that family firms are more likely to choose a specialist auditor than nonfamily firms, consistent with the argument that family firms need to signal their non-expropriating behaviors by choosing specialist auditors. I further find that audit fees are lower in family firms compared to nonfamily firms, consistent with the hypothesis that the Type 1 agency conflict dominates the Type 2 agency conflict in the determination of audit effort and pricing. Moreover, consistent with prior literature that states that effective internal governance demands a quality auditor and more audit effort irrespective of ownership structure, I find that the positive association between family ownership and specialist auditor choice is stronger when internal governance is strong and the negative relation between audit fees and family ownership is weaker when the internal governance is strong. I find that these results on audit fees are robust to the use of alternative measures of concentrated influence such as CEO ownership, inside director ownership, and the presence of one or more founder directors. I also find that the effect of internal governance on audit fees is not limited to one or a few components of internal governance...|$|R
50|$|By the 1960s, {{the economy}} was on a path of modest but steady {{economic}} growth. Real GDP growth during the 1960s averaged 4.2 percent a year, under the Latin American average of 5.7 percent but well ahead of the chaotic economy of the two previous decades. As part of the United States-sponsored Alliance for Progress, the government was encouraged to expand its planning apparatus for economic development. With assistance from the Organization of American States (OAS), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA), in 1962 Paraguay established the Technical Planning Secretariat (Secretaría Técnica de Planificación—STP), the major economic planning arm of the government. By 1965 the country had its first National Economic Plan, a two-year plan for 1965-66. This was followed by another two-year plan (1967-68) and then a series of five-year plans. Five-year plans—only general policy statements—were not typically adhered to or achieved and played a minimal role in Paraguay's economic growth and development. Compared with most Latin American countries, Paraguay had a small public sector. <b>Free</b> <b>enterprise</b> dominated the <b>economy,</b> export promotion was favored over import substitution, agriculture continued to dominate industry, and the economy remained generally open to international trade and market mechanisms.|$|R

50|$|Restricting entry by {{licensing}} {{is arguably}} a convenient and effective method {{of maintaining the}} high standards, high status and elite privileges of a profession as well as acting to eliminate competition from those who provide a cheaper but (allegedly) sub-standard service. Organizations such as the American Medical Association were explicitly set up to restrict the number of practitioners. However, libertarians like Milton Friedman have argued that this process is counterproductive as it seriously restricts the number of active professionals working in society and thus unnecessarily inhibits the working of a <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E

50|$|There {{was strong}} {{opposition}} to {{the wording of the}} bill from the business community, which feared government regulation, deficit spending and runaway inflation. Conservative Congressmen, led by Republican Senator Robert A. Taft, argued that business cycles in a <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>economy</b> were natural and that compensatory spending should not be exercised except in the most extreme of cases. Some also believed that the economy would naturally drive toward full employment levels. Others believed that accurate employment level forecasting by the government was not practical or feasible. Some were uncomfortable with an outright guarantee of employment.|$|E

50|$|My own move to Conservative party {{membership}} {{arose from}} the effect of my research into the cotton industry and the Manchester school of liberal economic philosophy. Here was a body of men who believed that a <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>economy</b> was not only efficient but brought moral growth to all men. The employer risked his capital on his judgement and must care for his workers {{as part of his}} stock in trade, and the workers would be enabled to become prosperous and through their own industry, thrift and moral courage could establish their own business enterprises and their personal independence to the advantage of themselves, their families and society.

Next, Brooks claims that only <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> creates true fairness by rewarding merit. Then, Brooks states that only <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> lifts up the poor and vulnerable. For this last section, Brooks cites many statistics regarding world poverty reduction from increased trade and globalization, as well as statistics concerning limited government breeding charity.|$|R
5000|$|Eisenhower was {{a fiscal}} {{conservative}} whose policy views {{were close to}} those of Taft— they agreed that a <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>economy</b> should run itself. Throughout Eisenhower's presidency, the top marginal tax rate was 91%—among the highest in American history. When Republicans gained control of both houses of the Congress following the 1952 election, conservatives pressed the president to support tax cuts. Eisenhower however, gave a higher priority to balancing the budget, and believed that taxes could not be cut until it was. [...] "We cannot afford to reduce taxes, and reduce income," [...] he said, [...] "until we have in sight a program of expenditure that shows that the factors of income and outgo will be balanced." [...] Eisenhower kept the national debt low and inflation near zero; additionally, three of his eight budgets were in the black.|$|E
50|$|Heavy {{reliance}} on many interacting market systems and {{different forms of}} markets is a feature of capitalism, and advocates of socialism often criticize markets and aim to substitute markets with economic planning to varying degrees. Competition is the regulatory mechanism of the market system. This article does not discuss the political impact of any particular system nor applications of a particular mechanism to any particular problem in real life. For more on specific types of real-life markets, see commodity markets, insurance markets, bond markets, energy markets, flea markets, debt markets, stock markets, online auctions, media exchange markets, real estate market, {{each of which is}} explained in its own article with features of its application, referring to market systems as such if needed.

40|$|In {{planning}} economic development, {{the responsible}} authorities normally {{do so with}} some specific objective or objectives in mind, such as a certain minimum per capita income, {{a certain level of}} employment, or a certain rate of growth. Though there might be little disagreement about the objectives, difficulties arise in realising them because of certain constraints, the most obvious of which, in the normal case, is the availability of labour and capital resources. Particularly in a <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>economy,</b> there are other constraints which may affect the feasibility of the objectives, such as the balance of payments, the investment behaviour of businessmen and the savings habits of firms and persons...|$|E
