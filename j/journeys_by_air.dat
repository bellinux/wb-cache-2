50|$|Stalin was {{reluctant}} to leave Moscow and was unwilling to risk <b>journeys</b> <b>by</b> <b>air,</b> while Roosevelt was physically disabled and found travel difficult. Churchill was an avid traveller and, {{as part of an}} ongoing series of wartime conferences, had already met with Roosevelt five times in North America and twice in Africa and had also held two prior meetings with Stalin in Moscow. In order to arrange this urgently needed meeting, Roosevelt tried to persuade Stalin to travel to Cairo. Stalin turned down this offer and also offers to meet in Baghdad or Basra, finally agreeing to meet in Tehran in November 1943.|$|E

The experience begins with a <b>journey</b> <b>by</b> <b>air</b> via a helicopter, land via a chauffeured Rolls-Royce and sea via a private luxury cruise. Later, at Cé La Vi, atop the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the diners will be surrounded with 10,000 roses and will enjoy an 18-course Modern Asian degustation menu with diamond-studded name-engraved chopsticks while seated on custom-made designer furniture designed to their tastes. The Jane Seymour will be presented at midnight with a fireworks display to follow.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first two}} {{statistics}} are computed for typical travels for respective forms of transport, so they {{cannot be used}} directly to compare risks related to different forms of transport in a particular travel [...] "from A to B". For example: according to statistics, a typical flight from Los Angeles to New York will carry a larger risk factor than a typical car travel from home to office. But a car travel from Los Angeles to New York would not be typical. It would be as large as several dozens of typical car travels, and associated risk will be larger as well. Because the journey would take a much longer time, the overall risk associated <b>by</b> making this <b>journey</b> <b>by</b> car will be higher than making the same <b>journey</b> <b>by</b> <b>air,</b> even if each individual hour of car travel can be less risky than an hour of flight.|$|R
40|$|Although {{safe and}} rapid, air travel may present {{problems}} {{for people with}} certain medical conditions. Most medical emergencies that occur during a flight are preventable by judicious screening and preparation. We provide guidelines for physicians who are consulted {{about the wisdom of}} undertaking a <b>journey</b> <b>by</b> <b>air.</b> Potential stresses before, during and after the flight are outlined, including decreased atmospheric pressure, low humidity, turbulence, inactivity and time changes. We recommend precautionary measures for passengers with certain medical conditions, such as recent myocardial infarction, pulmonary disorders, pneumothorax, cerebrovascular accidents and diabetes and for those who have recently had surgery. The policy regarding air travel for pregnant women varies with each airline, but for certain conditions associated with pregnancy supplemental oxygen should be ordered before the trip. The special equipment and care that most airlines offer to ill or disabled people are described...|$|R
50|$|Palin {{arrives in}} Alexandria, Egypt and has {{difficulty}} getting {{a train to}} Cairo. On arrival, he attends a local football match and appears in a cameo role in an Egyptian film. After seeing the Pyramids in Giza and riding a camel named Michael, Palin runs into difficulties when the ship {{he was supposed to}} board has engine problems and cannot sail. Even though he is able to take a ferry from the city of Suez to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, he misses a key connection that would have taken him to Muscat. As a last-ditch effort to save the journey, Palin and the director Clem Vallance (and somebody from the British Embassy and a driver for some of the way) are permitted by the Saudi authorities to drive across Saudi Arabia to Dubai, {{with the rest of the}} crew (and their problematic camera equipment) making the <b>journey</b> <b>by</b> <b>air.</b> The Saudi Arabia leg of the trip is represented in the TV series only with a few still pictures taken along the way.|$|R

5000|$|Newborn {{transport}} {{is used to}} move premature {{and other}} sick infants from hospitals without specialist, intensive care facilities require for optimal care of the baby to hospitals with neonatal intensive care and other specialist services. Neonatal transport services such as NETS utilise mobile intensive care incubators fitted with mechanical ventilators, infusion pumps and physiological monitors capable of being used in a mobile environment. These transport systems seek to emulate the environment of a neonatal intensive care and permit un-interrupted care to occur in a referring hospital and then during the <b>journey</b> <b>by</b> road or <b>air</b> ambulance. Power and medical gas supplies are carried within the system as well as making use of external supplies; as available. Infant transport systems commonly weigh over 100 kg and present a challenge to vehicle operators in terms of weight, manual handling, crash-worthiness and power consumption.|$|R
50|$|Absent voting {{was first}} {{introduced}} for the immediate post-war period in 1918 for servicemen and others prevented ‘by reason {{of the nature of}} their occupation…from voting at a poll by the Representation of the People Act 1918. Armed forces still serving overseas at the end of World War I were allowed to vote by post, and permanent arrangements were made for proxy voting by servicemen. The Representation of the People Act 1945 again made temporary provision for postal voting by service voters. Postal voting was not extended to civilians until 1948 when the Representation of the People Act 1948 granted postal voting facilities to both service personnel and to certain groups of civilians including those who were physically incapacitated, those unable to vote without making a <b>journey</b> <b>by</b> sea or <b>air</b> or {{because of the nature of}} their occupation, and those who were no longer residing at their qualifying address. All had to provide an address in the UK to which ballot papers could be sent. Service personnel could, alternatively, vote by proxy if they were likely to be at sea or abroad on polling day.|$|R
