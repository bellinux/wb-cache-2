5|$|Some philosophers, such as Paul Boghossian, have {{attempted}} to show that eliminativism is in some sense self-refuting, since the theory itself presupposes the existence of mental phenomena. If eliminativism is true, then the eliminativist must permit an intentional property like truth, supposing {{that in order to}} assert something one must believe it. Hence, for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist must believe that it is true; <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> then there are beliefs and the eliminativist claim is false.|$|E
25|$|Beckett said of Endgame that Hamm and Clov are Didi and Gogo {{at a later}} date, at the end {{of their}} lives. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> then the two {{characters}} in Rough for Theatre I could reflect what might have been if they had never found a way to get on in the first place.|$|E

25|$|A third {{interpretation}} {{relies on}} the theory that an individual form is capable of having properties of its own. According to this interpretation, the soul is a property of the body, but the ability to think is a property of the soul itself, not of the body. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> then the soul is the body's form and yet thinking need not involve any bodily organ.|$|E
25|$|Curiously, the {{southern}} section {{lies in the}} approximate zone of the OWL. (Note OWLndash&associated lineaments running parallel to the red line.)

25|$|The Viennese oyster {{position}} requires great flexibility {{from the}} woman to perform. The female lies {{on her back and}} moves her legs behind her head, with the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. This is a deep penetrating position and may not be suitable for men with larger than average penis size. However, in most cases, the female will not be flexible enough to achieve this position fully, and will need to stop well before the legs are behind the head. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the male partner can help hold the legs in a comfortable position and continue on with intercourse.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} aspects of the organization of the Inquisition was its form of financing: devoid of its own budget, the Inquisition depended exclusively on the confiscation of the goods of the denounced. It is not surprising, therefore, that many of those prosecuted were rich men. That the situation was open to abuse is evident, as stands out in the memorial that a converso from Toledo directed to Charles I: Your Majesty must provide, before all else, that the expenses of the Holy Office do not come from the properties of the condemned, because <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> if they do not burn they do not eat.|$|E
500|$|As Michael Robertson and Garry Walter suppose, {{psychiatric}} {{power in}} practically all societies expands {{on the grounds}} of public safety, which, {{in the view of the}} leaders of the USSR, was best maintained by the repression of dissidence. According to Gwen Adshead, a British forensic psychotherapist at the Broadmoor Hospital, the question is what is meant by the word [...] "abnormal." [...] Evidently it is possible for abnormal to be identified as [...] "socially inappropriate." [...] <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> social and political dissent is turned into a symptom by the medical terminology, and thereby becomes an individual's personal problem, not a social matter.|$|E

50|$|Because {{confidence}} in expected outcomes is often {{greater in the}} short-term (e.g., 20 years) than the long-term future, {{it may be more}} reasonable to use short-term projections to guide actions.

2500|$|There {{is concern}} that cuts to legal aid {{prevented}} tenants and tenants' groups taking legal action over their safety concerns. Robert Bourns of The Law Society said, “There {{have been reports}} that tenants of Grenfell Tower were unable to access legal aid to challenge safety concerns because of the cuts. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> then {{we may have a}} very stark example of what limiting legal aid can mean.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{timeline}} {{problem is}} that critics claim that too much happened between the filming (at 1:15 at the earliest) and the filmmakers' arrival in Willow Creek (at 6:30 at the latest). Daegling wrote, [...] "All {{of the problems with}} the timeline disappear if the film is shot a few days or hours beforehand. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> one has to wonder what other details of this story are wrong."

2500|$|An {{executor}} is {{the person}} appointed by a will {{to act on the}} behalf of the estate of the will maker (the [...] "testator") upon his or her death. An executor is the legal personal representative of a deceased person's estate. The appointment of an executor only becomes effective after the death of the testator. After the testator dies, the person named in the will as executor can decline or renounce the position, and <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> should very quickly notify the probate court registry accordingly.

30|$|One {{interpretation}} of this set of results <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> participants performed similarly between the modes; this led the raters to assign similar ratings to their performance during each of <b>the</b> modes. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> case, the findings for <b>the</b> analytic scales <b>were</b> {{consistent with those of}} studies on tape-based speaking tests that used the ACTFL holistic scale (Kenyon and Tschirner 2000; Shohamy 2004). Thus, it appears <b>that</b> delivery mode <b>is</b> not a factor that affects the magnitude of scores, regardless of the type of rating scale used. However, more empirical evidence is needed to support this conclusion.|$|R
25|$|Although {{informal}} consultations {{started in}} late April, the main {{negotiations between the}} Soviet Union, Britain and France began in May.

2500|$|There is a {{controversy}} {{as to whether}} the US racial gap in IQ scores is diminishing. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> then this {{may or may not be}} related to the Flynn effect. Flynn has commented that he never claimed that the Flynn effect has the same causes as the black-white gap, but that it shows that environmental factors can create IQ differences of a magnitude similar to the gap. Research that has examined whether g factor and IQ gains from the Flynn effect are related have found there is a negative correlation between the two, which may indicate that group differences and the Flynn effect are possibly due to differing causes ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{same day}} on May 5, the Senate {{made its first}} {{comments}} on the U-2 incident, and began a domestic political controversy for Eisenhower. Mike Mansfield, the Senate Majority Whip, stated, [...] "First reports indicate that the President {{had no knowledge of}} the plane incident. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> we have got to ask whether or not this administration has any real control over the federal bureaucracy." [...] Mansfield, more than any other person, highlighted the dilemma Eisenhower faced—Eisenhower could admit responsibility for the U-2 flight, and likely ruin any chances for détente at the Paris Summit, or he could continue to deny knowledge and indicate that he did not control his own administration.|$|E
2500|$|Cameron {{was named}} in homage to Terminator film {{franchise}} creator James Cameron, whose original Terminator character concept was referenced by series creator Josh Friedman as {{he created the}} character. James Cameron envisioned Terminators as robotic, humanoid infiltration units [...] "that could blend in with humanity". In keeping with this idea, Friedman introduced his character as the most advanced model of Terminator, whose ascendancy over other models was defined by its ability to mimic human behavior. The decision to make the character {{appear to be a}} teenaged female with a small physical stature was also influenced by James Cameron's infiltrator idea. According to consulting producer James Middleton, [...] "Terminators—and this is from [...] Cameron's vision of the mythology—are actually infiltrators. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> then what better infiltrator than a beautiful, petite teenage girl?" ...|$|E

25|$|As per Smith's and Strachey's reports, Dr. David Beers Quinn {{theorized that}} the colonists moved north to {{integrate}} with the Chesepians that Chief Powhatan {{claimed to have}} killed.
