5|$|Based at Rice University in Houston, Texas, The Papers of Jefferson Davis is an editing {{project to}} publish <b>documents</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Davis. Since the early 1960s, it has {{published}} 13 volumes, {{the first in}} 1971 {{and the most recent}} in 2012; two more volumes are planned. The project has roughly 100,000 documents in its archives.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1980s on there was {{increasing}} pressure {{on both the}} Polish and Soviet governments to release <b>documents</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in {{the agenda of the}} 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed that Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted that the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky.|$|E
5|$|He {{has also}} collaborated with Pierre Christin {{on a number}} of non-Valérian projects. The first of these was Lady Polaris in 1987, an {{illustrated}} novel about the mysterious disappearance of a cargo vessel, the Lady Polaris. The narrative comprises various <b>documents</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the lost ship: comic strips, log books, even an investigative journalism account by a fictionalised Mézières and Christin. The action takes place against the backdrop of many of the great seaports of Europe. Mézières undertook considerable research in putting together this book, visiting the ports of Liverpool, Copenhagen, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Lübeck, Bordeaux, Bilbao and Genoa.|$|E

5|$|In the Soviet Union {{during the}} 1950s, {{the head of}} KGB, Alexander Shelepin, {{proposed}} and carried out the destruction of many <b>documents</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Katyn massacre {{in order to minimize}} the chance that the truth would be revealed. His 3 March 1959 note to Nikita Khrushchev, with information about the execution of 21,857 Poles and with the proposal to destroy their personal files, became one of the documents that were preserved and eventually made public.|$|E
5|$|A {{panel of}} MPs began {{the task of}} going through over 40,000 <b>documents</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Afghan detainees on 10 July 2010. The MPs, {{consisting}} of one member and one alternate from the Liberal, Conservative and Bloc parties, determines what is relevant to the allegations of abuse. An independent panel of jurists determines how documents will be released publicly, in some cases censoring documents that may threaten national security, international relations, or soldiers in Afghanistan. This panel consists of Frank Iacobucci, fellow former Supreme Court justice Claire L'Heureux-Dubé and former B.C. Supreme Court judge Donald Brenner. Any documents that the government claims to contain legal advice may force the panel to determine whether to allow the MPs to see them.|$|E
5|$|Further {{activities}} of Operation Labrador were abandoned in September, after Croatian authorities captured the Yugoslav Air Force regional headquarters in Zagreb, and confiscated <b>documents</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the operation. The authorities took {{nearly a month}} to analyze the captured documents, allowing time for the principal agents involved in the bombings to flee. Fifteen others were arrested {{in connection with the}} attack, but they were subsequently released in a prisoner exchange. Five KOS agents involved in Operation Labrador were tried in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on terrorism charges and acquitted. Croatian authorities captured two KOS agents who were part of the operation and tried them along with seven other agents who were tried in absentia. Those in custody were acquitted, while those tried in absentia were convicted.|$|E

5|$|Raoul Wallenberg's half-brother, Guy von Dardel, a {{well-known}} physicist, retired from CERN, {{was dedicated to}} finding out his half-brother's fate. He traveled to the Soviet Union about fifty times for discussions and research, including {{an examination of the}} Vladimir prison records. Over the years, Professor von Dardel compiled a 50,000-page archive of interviews, journal articles, letters, and other <b>documents</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> his quest. In 1991, Dardel initiated a Swedish-Russian working group to search eleven separate military and government archives from the former Soviet Union for information about Wallenberg's fate, but the group was not able to find conclusive information. Many, including Professor von Dardel and his daughters Louise and Marie, do not accept the various versions of Wallenberg's death. They continue to request that the archives in Russia, Sweden, and Hungary be opened to impartial researchers.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} embrasured watchtower {{constructed in}} 1378, {{was destroyed by}} fire in 1926 {{during the civil war}} of 1926, and was restored in September 2014. This was done after a careful historical review of <b>documents</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the historical features that existed before it was damaged. The other three watchtowers forming the northern, eastern and western gates of the wall were also examined during the planning phase of the modifications done for the South Tower. They were modified, without affecting the integrity of the wall, by an encompassing hall offering protection to the structures by using steel, wood work and the ancient-type tiles and bricks structure. Major gates have ramp access except the South Gate which has entry outside the walls.|$|E

5|$|Cook County {{homeowners are}} {{eligible}} for a property-tax break on their primary residence, but a manager in Assessor's office was granted the homeowner's exemption on two homes. In 2012 Cook County Inspector General Blanchard subpoenaed the Assessor's office seeking <b>documents</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the exemptions. Berrios ignored the subpoena, claiming that the County Inspector General has no authority over him. Blanchard filed suit against Berrios. Berrios is represented in the suit by Cook County State's Attorney Alvarez. On January, 15, 2014, a Cook County circuit court judge ruled that the County Inspector General {{had the authority to}} investigate the Assessor and all other independently elected County offices. On August 21, 2014, the judge ruled the Assessor must comply with the Inspector General's subpoena. On December 1, 2016, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Cook County Inspector General has the power to investigate the Cook County Assessor, affirming two lower court decisions.|$|E
5|$|Seattle filed {{a lawsuit}} on September 23, 2007 {{in an attempt to}} keep the Sonics from leaving before the end of their lease in 2010. The trial was set for June 16, 2008. On April 10, 2008, Seattle asked the Federal District Court to order the NBA to release <b>documents</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the {{financial}} situation of each team, the claim that the SuperSonics' lease with KeyArena was financially unworkable, and the league's involvement in requiring PBC to make a good-faith effort to stay in Seattle. On April 28, the trial's presiding judge, Loretta Preska, ruled that the NBA must supply the internal documents about the possible relocation of the Sonics that the city of Seattle had requested. In addition, the judge said that Stern could be deposed at a later day should the need arise. The city hoped the documents would aid in building its legal case, and cited an email conversation among members of the ownership group that suggested they were privately discussing intent to move the team while publicly insisting that they would not attempt to do so.|$|E
