50|$|In 1920, {{the station}} was served by a local freight train (Nahgüterzug) from Ebernburg on the Alsenz Valley Railway that stopped at the {{stations}} between Bad Münster and Lauterecken-Grumbach and then ran without stopping to Homburg. Another local freight trains was responsible for serving stations between Lauterecken-Grumbach and Homburg. If necessary, another through freight train ran from Homburg to Lauterecken-Grumbach. In Odernheim there was a siding to the local oil mill, which was served by a freight <b>exchange</b> <b>train</b> (Übergabegüterzug). After freight traffic on the Glan Valley Railway was significantly reduced after the Second World War, the sections with freight traffic were served by a freight <b>exchange</b> <b>train.</b>|$|E

[...] All freight tracks have since been removed and there are now no freight {{operations}} at the station.|$|E
50|$|Kusel station owed its {{importance}} to freight transport, {{especially for the}} local industry and the Unteroffizier-Krüger Barracks. Sometimes it served troop trains to the neighbouring Baumholder military training area. In 1905, it received or dispatched a total of 35,495.11 tons of freight. The station mainly received bricks, limestone, malt, flour, iron and other fertilizers, cement, gypsum and lime. It shipped mainly wire and wire nails, cereal and beer. In 1920, a local freight train (Nahgüterzug) ran from Kaiserslautern to Kusel and another ran between Altenglan and Kusel. A through freight train (Durchgangsgüterzug) ran from Kaiserslautern to Kusel. After the Second World War, revenue declined steadily. Until the mid-1960s, the stations of Thallichtenberg and Pfeffelbach along the line to Türkismühle were served by a freight <b>exchange</b> <b>train</b> (Übergabegüterzug) from Kusel. In the 1990s, it was served only by a freight <b>exchange</b> <b>train</b> between Kaiserslautern-Einsiedlerhof station on the Mannheim-Saarbrücken line and Kusel. Now, the station has no freight operations and its freight tracks have been dismantled.|$|E

50|$|In 1920, a local {{freight train}} (Nahgüterzug) ran from Kaiserslautern to Kusel and another ran from Ebernburg freight yard on the Alsenz Valley Railway along the Glan Valley Railway serving all {{stations}} between Lauterecken-Grumbach and Homburg. In the 1990s the stations on Landstuhl-Kusel line—apart from Theisbergstegen and Rammelsbach stations, which {{continued to be}} served by trains to the nearby quarries—was served only by a freight <b>exchange</b> <b>train</b> (Übergabegüterzug). Glan-Münchweiler station now has no freight operations.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{the line}} is used several times an hour for freight. The trains run between Ehrang and Wasserbillig and between Saarbrücken and Apach. The railway to the Euren/Zewen {{industrial}} area is served from Monday to Friday at noon by a freight <b>exchange</b> <b>train</b> (Übergabegüterzug), which runs regularly from Ehrang via Trier-West and Euren. Additional services, such as wine deliveries to Schloss Wachenheim, operate as required. In addition, the Trier West Railway serves as an alternative route for freight, depending on the workload through Trier Hauptbahnhof.|$|E
50|$|A Nahgüterzug (abbreviation: Ng) is {{the name}} given to a {{category}} of local goods train in German-speaking countries. It describes a type of goods train that, unlike the Durchgangsgüterzug (through goods train) - does not stay together for its entire journey; instead wagons can be added or dropped off at intermediate stations en route. And unlike the Übergabegüterzug (goods <b>exchange</b> <b>train)</b> Nahgüterzüge run from one railway hub to another, usually between two marshalling yards. Along the way various groups of wagons are detached or collected at the intermediate stations.|$|E

5000|$|An Übergabegüterzug (abbreviated to: Üg or Übergabe, {{literally}} goods <b>exchange</b> <b>train)</b> is a {{goods train}} that moves individual goods wagons {{on the first}} or last stage of their journey i.e. from the start to the first railway hub or from the final railway hub to its destination. Between hubs the wagons are hauled by Nahgüterzüge (Ng), i.e. local goods trains, or Durchgangsgüterzüge (through goods trains). These trains generally cover relatively short distances and {{only have a few}} wagons that are delivered to and collected from industrial or loading sidings, either individually or in so-called wagon groups.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, freight trains operated over the Kaiserslautern-Homburg-Landau-Germersheim and Saarbrücken-Landau-Germersheim lines. Their customers at the station included Stabila, a local manufacturer of measuring instruments. After the Second World War freight traffic also lost importance. From the 1980s onwards, a Übergabegüterzug (goods <b>exchange</b> <b>train)</b> served the station. Its operation were based in Neustadt Hauptbahnhof. The trains ran from Landau to Wilgartswiesen. Operation of freight traffic at the station ended in 1994. Subsequently, the loading tracks at the station were disconnected and partially dismantled in 2001. Subsequently, the loading tracks in the station were disconnected and partially dismantled in 2001. It had already lost all freight traffic traffic a few years earlier.|$|E
50|$|While it is cost {{effective}} to liquefy natural gas for storage, transport, and use, roughly 10 to 15 {{percent of the}} gas gets consumed during the process. The optimal process contains four stages of propane refrigeration and two stages of ethylene refrigeration. There can be the addition of an additional refrigerant stage, but the additional costs of equipment are not economically justifiable. Efficiency can be tied to the pure component cascade processes which minimize the overall source to sink temperature difference associated with refrigerant condensing. The optimized process incorporates optimized heat recovery along {{with the use of}} pure refrigerants. All process designers of liquefaction plants using proven technologies face the same challenge: to efficiently cool and condense a mixture with a pure refrigerant. In the optimized Cascade process, the mixture to be cooled and condensed is the feed gas. In the propane mixed refrigerant processes, the two mixtures requiring cooling and condensing are the feed gas and the mixed refrigerant. The chief source of inefficiency lies in the heat <b>exchange</b> <b>train</b> during the liquefaction process.|$|E

50|$|The World - With {{this map}} players start with 3 train cards, 7 ship cards, 5 {{destination}} tickets, 25 trains, 50 ships, and 3 harbors. After choosing which destination tickets to keep (at least 3), players must discard train and/or ship pieces (back into the box) {{until they have}} a combined total of 60 trains/ships. Players have five options during their turn of which they may only choose one. First, they may take 2 travel cards (any combination of train and/or ship cards) or 1 face up locomotive. Replaced face up cards can be taken from either the train or ship deck at the current player's discretion. Second, they may claim a route {{with a set of}} train cards (for land routes) or ship cards (for water routes). Wild locomotives (which are all in the train deck) can be used to substitute for any color of train or ship cards. Third, they may draw four destination tickets of which they must keep at least one. Of the 65 destination tickets, eight are Tour Destination Tickets which have 3 or more cities to connect. Fourth, they may build a harbor on a port city (marked with an anchor on the board), but only after they have claimed a route which connects to that port city. To place the harbor, they must discard two train cards and two ship cards. All must be the same color and have a harbor icon on them. A wild locomotive may be used as a substitute. Fifth, they may <b>exchange</b> <b>train</b> pieces for ship pieces or vice versa with the 15 pieces they discarded into the box {{at the beginning of the}} game. They may exchange any number of pieces, but each piece exchanged is minus 1 point to the player's score. When one player has a combination of 6 or fewer train/ship pieces, then each player gets 2 more turns. Final scoring includes the players current score from claiming routes and exchanging pieces; then adding completed destination ticket points and subtracting uncompleted destination ticket points; then scoring harbors, 20 points if only one destination ticket includes the harbor city, 30 if two tickets include the harbor city and 40 if three or more tickets include the harbor city; and finally subtracting 4 points for each unplaced harbor. There are no other bonuses in this game.|$|E
