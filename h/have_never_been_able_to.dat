5|$|Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) {{continues}} to struggle in deciphering an encrypted Starfleet {{message that they}} previously obtained through the Hirogen relay system (""). Neelix (Ethan Phillips) returns to Voyager with a guest, Arturis (Ray Wise), who helped him obtain supplies. Arturis learns of the encoded message and offers to help decrypt it. He is successful, and finds that the message is from Starfleet Command, with a nearby set of coordinates where their means of getting back home can be found. Though {{the rest of the}} crew is elated at this news, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) remains cautious, given that the Borg <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> assimilate Arturis' species. Voyager arrives at the provided coordinates to find an unmanned Starfleet vessel, the Dauntless, of unknown design. Aboard, they find the ship uses quantum slipstream technology, which will allow them to arrive back in the Alpha Quadrant within a few months.|$|E

The Commission itself suffered from a loss of trust and reputation, only compounded by the post-Delors mood. Prodi had to deal with increased euroscepticism which helped bring down the Santer Commission. Since the end of the Delors era, pro-integrationism had given way with greater concern about the Commission's powers. By just 2000 the Council curbed the Commission's powers once more when they believed Prodi overstepped his remit.|$|E
25|$|The salmon {{fisheries}} of the Columbia River are now but {{a fraction}} of what they were twenty-five years ago, and what they would be now if the United States Government had taken complete charge of them by intervening between Oregon and Washington. During these twenty-five years the fishermen of each State have naturally tried to take all they could get, and the two legislatures <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree {{for the protection of the}} fisheries. At the moment the fishing on the Oregon side is practically closed, while there is no limit on the Washington side of any kind, and no one can tell what the courts will decide as to the very statutes under which this action and non-action result. Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle between the associated, or gill-net, fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river.|$|E

500|$|Aida was {{commissioned}} by the Egyptian government for the opera house built by the Khedive Isma'il Pasha to celebrate {{the opening of the}} Suez Canal in 1869. The opera house actually opened with a production of Rigoletto. The prose libretto in French by Camille du Locle, based on a scenario by the Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, was transformed to Italian verse by Antonio Ghislanzoni. Verdi was offered the enormous sum of 150,000 francs for the opera (even though he confessed that Ancient Egypt was [...] "a civilization I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> admire"), and it was first performed in Cairo in 1871. Verdi spent much of 1872 and 1873 supervising the Italian productions of Aida at Milan, Parma and Naples, effectively acting as producer and demanding high standards and adequate rehearsal time. During the rehearsals for the Naples production he wrote his string quartet, the only chamber music by him to survive, and the only major work in the form by an Italian of the 19th century.|$|E
500|$|News of {{the deaths}} of Captain Scott and his companions on their return [...] from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy {{background}} Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott’s expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. [...] Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> care one farthing about the Poles". Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–04, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds. Bruce generously allowed Shackleton to adopt his plans, although the eventual scheme announced by Shackleton owed little to Bruce. [...] On 29 December 1913, having acquired his first promises of financial backing—a £10,000 grant from the British Government—Shackleton made his plans public, {{in a letter to}} [...] The Times.|$|E

500|$|Hay {{continued}} to devote {{much of his}} energy to Republican politics. [...] In 1884, he supported Blaine for president, donating considerable sums to the senator's unsuccessful campaign against New York Governor Grover Cleveland. [...] Many of Hay's friends were unenthusiastic about Blaine's candidacy, to Hay's anger, and he wrote to editor Richard Watson Gilder, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> appreciate the logic that induces some excellent people every four years because they cannot nominate the candidate they prefer {{to vote for the}} party they don't prefer." [...] In 1888, Hay had to follow his own advice as his favored candidate, Ohio Senator John Sherman, was unsuccessful at the Republican convention. [...] After some reluctance, Hay supported the nominee, former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison, who was elected. [...] Though Harrison appointed men whom Hay supported, including Blaine, Reid, and Robert Lincoln, Hay was not asked to serve in the Harrison administration. In 1890, Hay spoke for Republican congressional candidates, addressing a rally of 10,000 people in New York City, but the party was defeated, losing control of Congress. Hay contributed funds to Harrison's unsuccessful re-election effort, in part because Reid had been made Harrison's 1892 running mate.|$|E
500|$|By the {{standards}} of the Western front, the gains of the first two days were nothing short of spectacular. A great deal of ground was gained for relatively few casualties and a number of strategically significant points were captured, notably Vimy Ridge. Additionally, the offensive succeeded in drawing German troops away from the French offensive in the Aisne sector. In many respects, the battle might be deemed a victory for the British and their allies but these gains were offset by high casualties and the ultimate failure of the French offensive at the Aisne. By the end of the offensive, the British had suffered more than 150,000 casualties and gained little ground since the first day. Despite significant early gains, they were unable to effect a breakthrough and the situation reverted to stalemate. Although historians generally consider the battle a British victory, in the wider context of the front, it had very little impact on the strategic or tactical situation. Ludendorff later commented [...] "no doubt exceedingly important strategic objects lay behind the British attack but I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> discover what they were". Ludendorff was also [...] "very depressed; had our principles of defensive tactics proved false and if so, what was to be done?" ...|$|E
500|$|Hu's {{most notable}} {{work is the}} Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy (Shizhuzhai Shuhuapu, [...] ), an {{anthology}} of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists (including Hu himself), published in 1633. It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, bamboo, flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes. As well {{as a collection of}} artworks, it was also intended as an artistic primer, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting. In this book, Hu used his multiple-block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images, rather than obvious outlines or overlaps. The manual is bound in the [...] "butterfly binding" [...] (hudie zhuang, [...] ) style, whereby whole-folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double-page spread. This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image. Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual, including all writings and illustrations in August, 2015. Said Charles Aylmer, Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department, [...] "The binding is so fragile, and the manual so delicate, that until it was digitized, we <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> let anyone look through it or study it – despite its undoubted importance to scholars." ...|$|E
