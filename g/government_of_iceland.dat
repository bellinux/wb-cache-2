Due {{to the size of the}} combined balance sheet of those banks the <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iceland</b> did not have the means to save those banks. They were put into receivership instead with their boards replaced. Nevertheless, the failed banks were restructured by dividing them into a new and an old bank in order to avoid a credit crunch.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iceland</b> to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign {{of the success of the}} above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented by the government of Geir H. Haarde but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.|$|E
25|$|The Danish–Icelandic Act of Union, an {{agreement}} with Denmark signed on 1 December 1918 and valid for 25years, recognised Iceland as a fully sovereign state in a personal union with Denmark.

Norwegian crews were involved in training Icelandic whalers into the early 1950s.|$|E

In February 2017 the city decided to evaluate the migration back to Windowssome stated reasons were missing compatibility, bad user acceptance and complexity. In March 2012, the <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iceland</b> launched a project to get all public institutions using free and open-source software. Already, several government agencies and schools have adopted Ubuntu. The government cited cost savings as a big factor for the decision, and also stated that open source software avoids vendor lock-in. A 12-month project was launched to migrate the biggest public institutions in Iceland to using open-source software, and help ease the migration for others. US president Barack Obama's successful campaign for re-election in 2012 used Ubuntu in its IT department. In August 2014, the city of Turin, Italy, announced its migration from Windows XP to Ubuntu for the 8,300 desktop computers used by the municipality, becoming the first city in Italy to adopt Ubuntu.|$|E

25|$|The <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iceland</b> {{have always}} been {{coalition}} governments, with two or more parties involved, as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the Althing throughout the republican period. The extent of the political power possessed {{by the office of}} the president is disputed by legal scholars, in Iceland; several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers, but other provisions and traditions suggest differently. In 1980, Icelanders elected Vigdís Finnbogadóttir as president, the world's first directly elected female head of state. She retired from office in 1996.

Sympathetic to Fischer's plight, but reluctant to grant him the full benefits of citizenship, Icelandic authorities granted him an alien's passport. When this proved insufficient for the Japanese authorities, the Althing (the Icelandic Parliament), at the behest of William Lombardy, agreed unanimously to grant Fischer full citizenship in late March for humanitarian reasons, as they felt he was being unjustly treated by the U.S. and Japanese governments, and also in recognition of his 1972 match, which had [...] "put Iceland on the map".|$|E
500|$|The <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iceland</b> {{has played}} a major role in the {{advancement}} of geothermal energy. In the 1940s, the State Electricity Authority was started by the government in order to increase the knowledge of geothermal resources and the utilization of geothermal power in Iceland. It was later changed to the National Energy Authority (Orkustofnun) in 1967. This agency has been very successful and has made it economically [...] to use geothermal energy as a source for heating in many different areas throughout the country. Geothermal power has been so successful that the government no longer has to lead the research in this field because it has been taken over by the geothermal industries.|$|E

Women’s limited access to the most senior levels of organizations, including the board level, is well recognized internationally (Davies et al., 2011; Deloitte, 2011) and responses to women’s under-representation differ across countries. The <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iceland,</b> Israel, Norway and Spain have opted to legislate for women’s representation on boards, to varying degrees and with varying timelines for compliance (Catalyst, 2012; GovernanceMetrics Int ernational, 2013).

Iceland has considerable renewable energy resources, especially geothermal energy and hydropower resources, and most of the potential has not been developed, partly because there is not enough demand for additional electricity generation capacity from the residents and industry of Iceland, but the United Kingdom is interested in importing inexpensive electricity from renewable sources of energy, and this could lead to further development of the energy resources.|$|E
