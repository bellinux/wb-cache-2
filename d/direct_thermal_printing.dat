50|$|In printing, {{a thermal}} {{transfer}} is {{the transfer of}} a design or text onto paper by the melting of wax within the print-heads of a specialized printer.Thermal transfer is preferred over <b>direct</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>printing</b> on surfaces that are heat sensitive or when higher durability of printed matter (especially against heat) is desired.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, thermal {{transfer}} printers use heat to transfer ink from ribbon onto the label {{for a permanent}} print. Some thermal transfer printers are also capable of <b>direct</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>printing.</b> Using a PVC vinyl can increase the longevity of the label life as seen in pipe markers and industrial safety labels found {{in much of the}} market place today.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{printing}} (or <b>direct</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>printing)</b> is {{a digital}} printing process which produces a printed image by selectively heating coated thermochromic paper, or thermal paper {{as it is}} commonly known, when the paper passes over the thermal print head. The coating turns black in the areas where it is heated, producing an image. Two-colour direct thermal printers can print both black and an additional colour (often red) by applying heat at two different temperatures.|$|E
40|$|The {{subjective}} {{image quality}} of panoramic radiographs shown on a diagnostic computer monitor {{were compared with}} professional <b>direct</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>prints</b> and with common inkjet prints on different paper qualities. Indirect digital panoramic radiographs were obtained from 15 patients. The images were <b>printed</b> with a <b>direct</b> <b>thermal</b> printer in their original format. Afterwards, these were loaded in an imaging software programme (Microsoft Photo Editor) and assessed both on computer monitor and inkjet prints on transparency, glossy, satin and regular paper. Five observers assessed subjective image quality for different regions and anatomical landmarks on a 5 -point rating scale. Data were statistically analysed and inter- and intra-observer performances were calculated. Best image quality was obtained with <b>direct</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>prints,</b> followed in descending order by panoramic images viewed on the monitor, inkjet prints on transparencies, glossy paper, satin paper and finally regular paper. The differences were significant except for monitor images versus <b>direct</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>prints,</b> inkjet-transparencies and inkjet-glossy images and inkjet-satin versus inkjet-glossy images. The subjective image quality of indirect digital panoramic images is different for images shown on the computer monitor and for printed images depending on both the printer and paper type used. status: publishe...|$|R

The focus is given to parameters that are critical to telemetry station operation such as quality of the chart output, maintenance and support, reliability and cost.

40|$|Thermal {{printing}} is a {{rapid and}} inexpensive printing technology {{widely used in}} commercial applications such as point-of-sale receipts, luggage tags, faxes, and labels (Mendum, Stoler et al. 2011). <b>Direct</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>printing</b> produces an image when specific chemicals within the coating of thermal paper are heated. 5 Thermal printing technology was first developed in the late 1960 s, and its popularity grew in the 1980 s and 1990 s as it became more cost effective and versatile. This chapter describes {{the components of the}} thermal paper system, its associated equipment, process, and applications, as well as the alternative chemicals analyzed and considered in the alternatives assessment. 3. 1 Components of Thermal Paper Thermal paper is a highly engineered product that is coated with a thermal sensitive layer that reacts in the presence of heat to create the printed image. The following sections describe the key components of thermal paper development, including chemistry and manufacture. This information was useful in evaluating potential alternatives in this application. 3. 1. 1 Paper Thermal paper is a standard paper grade that has been coated with a thermal sensitive layer, also known as a thermal reactive layer (see Figure 3 - 1). A pre-coat, or base coat, is applied to the base paper and allows for high resolution by preventing the heat transfer through all of the paperâ€Ÿs layers, and for smoothness. Applied to the pre-coat is a thermal layer that contains the necessary reactive components (see Section 3. 1. 2). Additionally, thermal paper may contain a protective top coat and/or back coat. Top coats may be used for some applications to protect thermal paper from mechanical stress or chemical reactions. Similarly, back coats may be used to provide additional protection during lamination, printing, or other mechanical processes (Koehler Thermal Papers n. d.). Thermal paper used for receipts typically lack the top and back coats...|$|E

No appreciable differences were noted between the electrochemical behaviour of the two samples, indicating that the <b>thermal</b> <b>printing</b> of the polymer did not alter appreciably the material properties.

40|$|The authors {{compare the}} maximum read range of passive ultra-high-frequency {{radio-frequency}} identification tags {{that have been}} produced using different metal printing techniques, specifically inkjet <b>printing</b> and <b>thermal</b> transfer <b>printing</b> (TTP). They used the same substrate (THERMLfilm), antenna designs and electronic circuitry in their comparison so as to isolate {{the effect of the}} metal printing. Owing to the high metal conductivity, the <b>thermal</b> transfer <b>printed</b> tags printed with copper (Cu) film performed as well or better than the inkjet printed tags printed with silver ink, even when they changed the inkjet printed tags to a Kapton substrate that is better suited to inkjet printing. The aluminium (Al) <b>thermal</b> transfer <b>printed</b> tags had up to 33 % less read range than Cu <b>thermal</b> transfer <b>printed</b> tags. TTP needs no sintering, and provides an attractive alternative low-cost fabrication method. Characterisation of the printed traces by both methods reveals that the printing techniques achieve similar surface roughness. The achieved conductivities for TTP on THERMLfilm were better than for inkjet. The best measured read range for TTP was 10. 6 m. Across the different tag designs, the measured read ranges were 15 - 60 % (1 - 10 %) better for <b>thermal</b> <b>printing,</b> compared with inkjet printing on THERMLfilm (Kapton) ...|$|R
