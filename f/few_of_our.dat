500|$|Ibis, {{reviewing}} the Memoir of Thomas Bewick, written by himself in 1862, compares {{the effect of}} Bewick and Gilbert White, writing [...] "It was the pages of Gilbert White and the woodcuts of Bewick which first beguiled the English schoolboy to the observation of our feathered friends", and [...] "how <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> living naturalists but must gratefully acknowledge their early debt to White's 'History' and to the life-like woodcuts of Bewick!" [...] The reviewer judges that [...] "Probably we shall not wrong the cultivated annalist of Selborne by giving {{the first place to}} Bewick." [...] However, comparing them as people, [...] "Bewick has not the slightest claim to rank with Gilbert White as a naturalist. White was what Bewick never was, a man of science; but, if no naturalist, Bewick was a lover of nature, a careful observer, and a faithful copier of her ever-varying forms. In this, and in this alone, lies his charm." ...|$|E
500|$|Drake's {{physical}} attractiveness {{has been}} {{another area of}} commentary, {{with at least one}} reviewer declaring a man crush for him. Drake has been described as [...] "dreamy", and a [...] "handsome, charismatic hero." [...] Claudia Black, voice of Chloe Frazer from , admitted having a crush on Drake as well. Drake has been cited {{as an example of a}} male character who, while attractive, is not over-masculine. One commentator pointed out: [...] "Very <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> protagonists (Nathan Drake and Alan Wake to name a few exceptions) depict men in what I would call a non-degrading manner." [...] Steve McGarvey of GameSpy wrote that Drake was: [...] "hardly oozing with machismo compared to the likes of most gaming protagonists". Drake's attractiveness drew criticism from Meagan Marie of Game Informer, who stated that he did not: [...] "stand out much among the crowd of other ideally proportioned and intentionally unblemished gaming icons." [...] GameDaily named Drake the third greatest gaming hunk. GamesRadar named Drake [...] "Mister 2007", stating that he was not picked just because they could [...] "stare at his ass for hours on end", but because he is heroic and has a [...] "winning attitude". In 2014, La Nueva España included him the top ten sexiest video game characters of both genders.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests such under-counts {{cut in half}} the actual Armenian population. In the district of Mus (compromising Mus plain, Sassoun, and the counties of Mus) for example, the Armenian official {{in charge of the}} census, Garabed Potigian, presented the official figures as 225,000 Armenians and 55,000 Turks. Upon the insistence of his Turkish superiors he was forced to reduce the Armenian population to 105,000 and increase the Turkish population to 95,000. Lynch himself report similar incidences: “Pursuing our way, we meet an Armenian priest—a young, broad-shouldered, open-faced man. He seems inclined to speak, so we ask him how many churches there may be in Mush (Mus). He answers, seven; but the commissary had said four. A soldier addresses him in Kurdish; the poor fellow turns pale, and remarks that he was mistaken in saying seven; there cannot be more than four ...Such are a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> experiences during our short sojourn at Mush.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Poultry feed {{can also}} include {{roxarsone}} or nitarsone, arsenical antimicrobial drugs that also promote growth. Roxarsone {{was used as}} a broiler starter by about 70% of the broiler growers between 1995 and 2000. The drugs have generated controversy because it contains arsenic, which is highly toxic to humans. [...] This arsenic could be transmitted through run-off from the poultry yards. [...] A 2004 study by the U.S. magazine Consumer Reports reported [...] "no detectable arsenic in our samples of muscle" [...] but found [...] "A <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> chicken-liver samples has an amount that according to EPA standards could cause neurological problems in a child who ate 2 ounces of cooked liver per week or in an adult who ate 5.5 ounces per week." [...] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), however, is the organization responsible for the regulation of foods in America, and all samples tested were [...] "far less than the... amount allowed in a food product." ...|$|E
