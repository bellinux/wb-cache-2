50|$|When the bow {{collector}} {{was first}} conceived by German inventor Ernst Werner von Siemens {{in the late}} 1880s, American inventor Frank J. Sprague of Virginia had just patented his trolley pole system of current collection from an overhead wire. To avoid contravening this patent, the Siemens company was forced to design its own, unique <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> collection, namely the bow collector. The bow collector was first used by the Siemens electric company in its early electric tramcars in either the late 1880s or early 1890s. The Hobart electric tramway system - {{the first of its}} kind in the Southern Hemisphere, opened in 1893 - used Siemens cars with very early bow collectors. Many other continental European and some British tramway systems, including Leeds and Glasgow, also used this method.|$|E
5000|$|Lord Denning MR {{opined that}} {{normally}} a company would only constitute a bank if it undertook certain activities: (1) {{the acceptance of}} money from, and the collection of cheques for, customers and the placing of the funds to the customers’ credit; (2) honouring cheques or orders drawn on the bank by their customers when presented for payment and the debiting of the customers' accounts accordingly; and (3) keeping some <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> or running accounts for the entries of customers' credits and debits. But he further added that a company might still constitute a bank, even though it did not undertake these activities if it {{was regarded as a}} bank by other bankers. He stated that [...] "like many other beings, a banker is easier to recognise than to define. In case of doubt, it is, I think, permissible to look at the reputation of the firm amongst ordinary intelligent commercial men." [...] He also argued that when a business is running as a bank, judges should be reluctant to hold {{that it is not a}} bank.|$|E
5000|$|The digital ID project started already {{as early}} as in 1998 when Estonia had sought {{solutions}} on how to digitally identify their citizens. By 1999 a viable project in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> ID-card was proposed and the legal framework to enable digital identification {{was set up in}} the following years. In 2000 the Identity Documents Act and the Digital Signatures Act, the two most important bills regulating the use of digital ID’s, were passed in the parliament. The first states the conditions to which an ID-card must adhere to, but most importantly states that the ID-card is compulsory for all Estonian citizens. The latter, states the conditions for a state-governed certification registry, which is fundamentally linked to the functioning of the digital ID-card. Following these events, the first ID-cards where issued in January 2002. Since then about 1.24 million of digital ID-cards have been issued. By the end of 2014 digital ID card has been used about 315 million times for personal identification and 157 million times for digital signatures. An average annual growth rate over 12 years (from 2003 to 2014) amounts to about 7.4 million authentications, and about 3.5 million signatures per year.|$|E
