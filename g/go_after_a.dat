25|$|Self-important, romantic, {{and nearly}} always wrong, Barney dreamed {{of the day}} he could use the one bullet Andy had issued to him, though he did fire his gun on a few occasions. He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape.

He started his association with Ealing in 1934, appearing in the fifth Gracie Fields picture, Sing As We <b>Go.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> ten-year absence from the studios, Holloway returned to star in Champagne Charlie in 1944 alongside Tommy Trinder and went on to star in Nicholas Nickleby (1947) and Another Shore (1948). However, it was the next three Ealing Comedies, Passport to Pimlico (1949), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953), which confirmed Holloway as a mainstay of British cinema. His final film with the studio was Meet Mr. Lucifer (1953).|$|E

500|$|In 1967 MLGL {{entered into}} {{negotiations}} {{to purchase the}} financially struggling Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team of the minor AAA International League. The asking price was $60,000. The deal ultimately fell apart due to concerns about the team's stadium, Maple Leaf Stadium, which needed up to $250,000 in repairs and whose owner wanted $4 million to purchase it, and the team was sold and relocated to become the Louisville Colonels for the following season. [...] MLGL owner Harold Ballard said that the company's interest was {{due in part to}} help position itself to <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise for Toronto. [...] In early 1974 MLGL announced plans to build a new baseball stadium in Toronto, but the city ultimately decided to renovate Exhibition Stadium to make it suitable for baseball. [...] At the time, the MLGL group, led by Lorne Duguid, vice-president of Hiram Walker Distillers and MLGL executive, was one of at least four bidding for a Toronto MLB team, including competing groups led by Labatt Brewing Company, Robert Hunter, the former President of the International League Maple Leafs, and Canadian Baseball Co, led by Sydney Cooper. [...] After negotiating with the owners of the Baltimore Orioles, Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians and Oakland Athletics in their attempt to acquire a team for Toronto, MLGL offered $15 million for the San Francisco Giants but the team's owner decided in early 1976 to sell the club to the Labatt group for US$13.25 million. [...] While the Giant's relocation was ultimately rejected by a U.S. court, Labatt was awarded an expansion team in the American League that became the Toronto Blue Jays for US$7 million later that year.|$|E
500|$|The [...] was sunk {{after taking}} {{a great deal of}} {{punishment}} from Intrepids air group. However, Center Force was able to limp back through San Bernardino Strait with [...] {{and a number of other}} ships intact. Intrepid was called north to <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> reported Japanese carrier group, Northern Force, which it encountered on October 25. Anti-aircraft fire was once again extremely intense, but this time Air Group 18 made it through the day without the loss of a single pilot. The group's strikes were reported likely to have sunk a light carrier and to have damaged both a carrier and a second light carrier. Northern Force was a diversion, however: Center Force had turned around and reentered San Bernardino Strait, heading for the American beachheads at Leyte. After reports filtered in alerting Admiral William Halsey Jr. to the danger posed by the remainder of Center Force, he ordered TG 38.2 to head south at full speed to reengage. The task group arrived hours too late to catch the Japanese battleships, which had once more fled in the face of the U.S. fleet. Though Admiral [...] Kurita devastated the escort carrier unit [...] "Taffy 3" [...] (taskforce) on the 25th, through fierce combat the much smaller, thinly armored Taffys had managed to hold off and even force the withdrawal of his warships. The mission of Air Group 18 on the 26th was to locate and destroy the remainder of Center Force as they were escaping back towards the Japanese home islands. Obscuring cloud cover, intense anti-aircraft fire and sheer flight distance contributed to mixed results for the air group. The initial search and subsequent strike located parts of Center Force in the Cuyo East Pass off the western coast of Panay. The bombers of VB-18 seriously damaged a [...] and torpedoed a [...] in addition to doing slight damage to a number of other vessels. A third sortie failed to locate Kurita's forces and returned to Intrepid empty-handed. This was something of a letdown for the pilots of Air Group 18, but they were still proud of their results at Leyte: five strikes against two separate Japanese forces causing serious damage to both, including the sinking of carriers and one of the largest battleships ever constructed.|$|E

In real-life incidents upon which this film is based, it was the Mafia, not the Black Hand, who functioned as the villain.

2500|$|After {{yet another}} dismal {{performance}} in , the Mariners managed their first winning season in , finishing 83–79 under manager Jim Lefebvre. Though {{it was the}} team's best season up to that point, it was only good enough for a fifth-place finish in the seven-team American League West in which no team finished under [...]500, and Lefebvre was fired after 1991. The team hired Bill Plummer as Lefebvre's replacement for the [...] season, but he too was let <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> 98-loss campaign in 1992.

Bill Swift would go on to win the ERA title in 1992 and finish 2nd in Cy Young voting in 1993, Mike Jackson would have a solid career as a relief pitcher and Burba would pitch well as both a reliever and starter. While Kevin Mitchell had a solid year in 1992, he would be traded the next season to Cincinnati for Norm Charlton and Mike Remlinger didn't even play in a Mariner uniform.
