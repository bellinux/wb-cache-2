5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot {{tolerate}} his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems {{to be only a}} nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E

500|$|Ryan White {{was seen}} by some as an [...] "innocent victim" [...] of the AIDS epidemic. Ryan White and his family {{strongly}} rejected the language of [...] "innocent victim" [...] because the phrase was often used to imply that gays with AIDS were [...] "guilty". Ryan's mother told The New York Times, Ryan always said, 'I'm <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> else with AIDS, no matter how I got it.' And {{he would never have}} lived as long as he did without the gay community. The people we knew in New York made sure we knew about the latest treatments way before we would have known in Indiana. I hear mothers today say they're not gonna work with no gay community on anything. Well, if it comes to your son's life, you better start changing your heart and your attitude around.|$|E

According to Dawes, as a finalist he {{received}} 10 guineas and an onyx inkstand, but has received no other compensation for the use of his image or his recorded version of the jingle. Dawes said, [...] "It was absolutely fantastic; I loved seeing my picture and singing the song and all my friends were very impressed... I have never wanted any money from it...

5000|$|When {{it comes}} to guns, we {{had to choose between}} history and the beloved {{spaghetti}} Westerns. As is often the case, reality turned out to be much less exciting than legend. During that time, revolvers were still very unreliable, and double-barreled shotguns were the most popular weapons in the Wild West. That's why spaghetti Westerns won that particular competition. This means that all weapons are very accurately re-created from their historical counterparts, but <b>just</b> <b>like</b> in <b>everyone's</b> favorite Western movies, they shouldn't really be there yet. Sometimes, their true date of introduction is just a few months away, but in other cases the difference is a couple of years.|$|R
500|$|Brazil played Italy in {{the final}} at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Pelé scored the opening goal with a header over Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich. He then made assists on Brazil's third goal, scored by Jairzinho, and the fourth {{finished}} by Carlos Alberto. The last goal {{of the game is}} often considered the greatest team goal of all time because it involved all but two of the team's outfield players. The play culminated after Pelé made a blind pass that went into Carlos Alberto's running trajectory. He came running from behind and struck the ball to score. Brazil won the match 4–1, keeping the Jules Rimet Trophy indefinitely, and Pelé received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament. Burgnich, who marked Pelé during the final, was quoted saying [...] "I told myself before the game, he's made of skin and bones <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> else— but I was wrong".|$|E

Everyone is working round the clock, showing up at every call, and the Chief is acting like a maniacal overlord." [...] Krill also enjoyed Oh's {{performance}} as Yang, writing: [...] "Cristina dealing with children is almost laughable – and actually provides a chuckle or two in this tense episode. Miss C thinks she is striking gold by moving to peds, because she {{will be able to do}} all types of surgery, and on little people, which makes the surgery harder, which is of course, better. Things don't turn out as planned, though, when she realizes kids are a little more resilient than their adult counterparts. And then Callie outs her to Arizona – in the she doesn’t really like kids sense of outing." [...] Krill enjoyed Wilson's performance as Bailey, in addition to Dane's, writing: [...] "He wins the best line of the show with 'That’s how I know my job is safe, Yang – I reattach babies arms.'" ...|$|E
500|$|At 4:30pm Pacific Time, Nixon, Chotiner, and Rogers were {{discussing}} where {{the public should}} be told to send their responses to the speech, when a Dewey aide telephoned for Nixon. Reluctantly, suspecting {{the reason for the}} call, Chotiner brought Nixon to the phone to speak with the New York governor. Dewey told Nixon that Eisenhower's aides were unanimous that Nixon must resign, though Dewey did not agree, and that Nixon was to so state {{at the end of his}} telecast. Nixon asked what the general wanted him to do. Dewey hedged, stating that he had not spoken with the presidential candidate himself, but that the word had come from such close aides to Eisenhower that the demand had to represent the general's view. The candidate replied that it was very late for him to change his remarks; Dewey assured him he need not do so, but simply add at the end his resignation from the ticket and his insistence that Eisenhower accept it. The governor suggested he even announce his resignation from the Senate and his intent to run in the special election which would follow—the two-time losing presidential candidate was sure Nixon would be returned with a huge majority, thus vindicating him. Nixon remained silent for some time, and when Dewey asked him what he would do, the senator told him that he did not know, and if Eisenhower's aides wanted to find out, they could watch <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> else. Before slamming down the receiver, Nixon added, [...] "And tell them I know something about politics, too!" ...|$|E

Captain Viegas was on the deck with several scientists and members of the crew when he suddenly noticed a flying object, which had a “ring” around it, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Saturn. <b>Everyone</b> reportedly saw the UFO at the same time.

500|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} in June 2013 by the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion (also known as VTsIOM), at least 90 percent of Russians surveyed were in favour of the law. Over 100 conservative groups worldwide signed a petition in support for the law, with Larry Jacobs, manager of the World Congress of Families, supporting its aim to [...] "prohibit advocacy aimed at involving minors in a lifestyle that would imperil their physical and moral health." [...] President of Russia Vladimir Putin answered to early objections to the then-proposed bill in April 2013 by stating that [...] "I want everyone to understand that in Russia there are no infringements on sexual minorities' rights. They're people, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> else, and they enjoy full rights and freedoms". He {{went on to say}} that he fully intended to sign the bill because the Russian people demanded it. As he put it, [...] "Can you imagine an organization promoting pedophilia in Russia? I think people in many Russian regions would have started to take up arms.... The same is true for sexual minorities: I can hardly imagine same-sex marriages being allowed in Chechnya. Can you imagine it? It would have resulted in human casualties." [...] Putin also mentioned that he was concerned about Russia's low birth rate, as same-sex relationships do not produce children. In August 2013, Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko also defended the law, equating it to protecting children from content that glorifies alcohol abuse or drug addiction. He also argued that the controversy over the law and its effects was [...] "invented" [...] by the Western media.|$|E
2500|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} those who are {{attracted}} to persons of the same sex are called to practice chastity, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> else. [...] The Catholic Church does not regard homosexual activity as an expression of the marital sacrament, which it teaches is only possible within a lifelong commitment of a marriage {{between a man and a}} woman. According to the Church's sexual ethics, homosexual activity falls short in the complementarity (male and female organs complement each other) and fecundity (openness to new life) of the sexual act.|$|E
2500|$|Doctors {{serving in}} the army were {{considered}} {{to be a member of}} the military. [...] <b>Just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> else they would take the military oath and be bound by the military law. [...] They would also start among the lower fighting ranks. [...] Even though they took the military oath and were among the lower ranks it did not mean they would be fighting among the masses. [...] These doctors were not always professionals or career physicians. [...] Oftentimes they were slaves who were forced into that career. [...] The Medici was also a group that treated wounded soldiers on the battlefield. [...] These men were not trained physicians even though they played the role of one. [...] Typically they were soldiers who demonstrated they had knowledge in wound treatment and even simple surgical techniques. [...] These men were used before the actual trained doctors were largely implemented. [...] Physicians got their knowledge from experience and information being passed down from person to person. [...] Likely they never used medical texts, as it was not common place even in the civilian field. [...] Generals and Emperors were exceptions, as they would typically have their own personal physician with them. [...] This was a common occurrence as Emperors such as Julian employed famous physicians such as Galen. [...] There were also physicians among the ranks of the Roman soldiers.|$|E

Testifying in his own defence, Bokassa stated: [...] "I'm not a saint. I'm <b>just</b> a man <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> else." [...] As testimony against him mounted, he gave away at several times his legendary short temper.

40|$|While {{people in}} the {{affluent}} world are living longer and healthier lives than ever before, they have {{become more and more}} fearful and worried about their health. Iona Heath untangles the distinct yet overlapping fears of patients, doctors, bureaucrats, politicians and society at large. In about 1848, while writing his famous poem The Bells, Edgar Allan Poe invented the wonderful word 2 ̆ 7 tintinnabulation 2 ̆ 7 to capture the sound of a ringing bell that lingers after the bell has been struck to mix with the sounds of succeeding bells. I want to talk about what we might describe as the tintinnabulation of fear that is driving the huge profits of the medical industrial complex—each fear reinforcing and interacting with the next, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> bells. <b>Everyone</b> is afraid of serious disease and its capacity to subvert and destroy hopes and lives, and so fear lurks, mostly unexpressed, within almost all symptoms, however apparently trivial. Iona Heath, retired GP These are very dangerous synergies and they are jeopardising the great projects of medical science and medical care. Firstly, there are the distinct yet overlapping fears of patients and of doctors, then of the bureaucrats and politicians who control the healthcare system, and of society and the culture that supports it. And secondly, there are the profits—the enormous amount of money that is made from inflating those fears, much of which is supported by good people trying to stop people dying of horrible diseases, but who succumb to a dangerous degree of wishful thinking...|$|R
500|$|Many {{have given}} {{suggestions}} as Jason's motivation for killing. Ken Kirzinger refers to Jason as a [...] "psychotic mama's boy gone horribly awry...very resilient. You can't kill him, but he feels pain, <b>just</b> not <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> else." [...] Kirzinger {{goes on to}} say that Jason is a [...] "psycho-savant", and believes his actions are based on pleasing his mother, and not anything personal. Andrew O'Hehir has stated, [...] "Coursing hormones act, of course, as smelling salts to prudish Jason, that ever-vigilant enforcer of William Bennett-style values." [...] Todd Farmer, writer for Jason X, wrote the scene where Jason wakes from cryonic hibernation just as two of the teenagers are having sex. Farmer liked the idea that sex acts triggered Jason back to life. Whatever his motivations, Kane Hodder believes there is a limit to what he will do. According to Hodder, Jason might violently murder any person he comes across, but when Jason Takes Manhattan called for Hodder to kick the lead character's dog, Hodder refused, stating that, while Jason has no qualms against killing humans, he is not bad enough to hurt animals. Another example from Jason Takes Manhattan, involves Jason being confronted by a street gang of young teenage boys one of whom threatens him with a knife, however Jason chooses not to kill them and instead scares them off by lifting up his mask and showing them his face. Likewise, director Tom McLoughlin chose not to have Jason harm any of the children he encounters in Jason Lives, stating that Jason would not kill a child, out of a sympathy for the plight of children generated by his own death as a child.|$|R
