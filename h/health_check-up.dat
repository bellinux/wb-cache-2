40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find out whether there is any {{relation}} between the use of preventive health services provided for by municipalities under the Japanese Health Services for the Elderly Act and the demands for in-patient and out-patient care by insured residents aged 40 or older who were covered by the National Health Insurance, eligible for preventive health services under the act, in nine cities within the same catchment area in Osaka Prefecture. Main outcome measures were correlation coefficients between the use of in-patient and out-patient care, and (1) the rate of use of <b>health</b> <b>check-ups,</b> and (2) the cost for preventive health services per resident. Hospital admission rate per 1000 insured persons had a strong negative correlation with the rate of use of <b>health</b> <b>check-ups.</b> The rate of long stay, 180 days or more, per 1000 insured persons was also negatively correlated with the rate of use of <b>health</b> <b>check-ups.</b> There were negative correlations between the rate of use of <b>health</b> <b>check-ups</b> and both the in-patient cost per insured person, and the rate of high in-patient cost, 600, 000 Yen or more, per 1000 insured persons. On the other hand, out-patient utilization rate per 1000 insured persons had a positive correlation with the rate of use of <b>health</b> <b>check-ups.</b> However, there was a negative relation between the rate of use of <b>health</b> <b>check-ups</b> and the out-patient cost per insured person because of negative associations between the rate of use of <b>health</b> <b>check-ups</b> and the out-patient days, and cost per case. The rate of high out-patient cost, 60, 000 Yen or more, was negatively correlated with out-patient utilization rate per 1000 insured persons. Negative relations were also shown between the cost for preventive health services per resident and the in-patient and out-patient cost per case and per insured person, except out-patient utilization rate per 1000 insured persons. The correlation coefficient between the cost for preventive health services per resident and the total medical cost per insured person was r = - 0. 779 (P = 0. 007). Provision of preventive health services under the Health Services for the Elderly Act may possibly improve health management in the early stage of diseases by detecting abnormalities in health, and that investing in prevention might contribute to reducing the subsequent total demand for medical care. <b>health</b> <b>check-ups</b> preventive <b>health</b> services use of medical care...|$|R

40|$|A {{questionnaire}} survey {{was administered to}} 317 parents who attended infant <b>health</b> <b>check-ups</b> in City B, Okayama Prefecture between October, 2008 and March, 2009. The {{questionnaire survey}} studied 7 factors based on the PRECEDE-PROCEED Model. We analysed factors that affected oral health behaviour and attendance at scheduled dental <b>health</b> <b>check-ups.</b> The survey containing 22 items concerning matters such as 'QOL' and 'health problems' was posted to parents and guardians in advance, and then collected {{on the day of}} the medical check-up. The collected data was analysed using the t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient, following which we conducted a covariance structure analysis. The results showed that dental health behaviour was directly affected by reinforcing factors, and indirectly associated with enabling and predisposing factors influenced by reinforcing factors. It was also shown that predisposing factors and oral health behaviour were associated with attendance at scheduled oral <b>health</b> <b>check-ups.</b> The results indicated that strengthening oral health education by sharing knowledge that acts as predisposing factors and introducing adaptations of oral health behaviour that that fit individual lives will lead to improved attendance at scheduled dental <b>health</b> <b>check-ups...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective. The {{information}} concerning the morbidity and mortality of hereditary hemochromatosis is based primarily on clinical cohorts of symptomatic patients. The major {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the long-term prognosis for Swedish patients with this condition, with respect to both clinical features and survival, in relation to the route by which the disease was detected. Patients and methods. 373 patients with hemochromatosis detected through routine health checkups (n = 153), family screening (n = 44), symptoms of arthralgia (n = 23), investigation of other diseases/symptoms (n = 108) or signs of liver disease (n = 45) were monitored for a mean period of 11. 9 +/- 5. 8 years. The degree of liver fibrosis and survival were analyzed. Results. Overall survival among these patients was not significantly different from that of a matched normal population. The patients diagnosed through <b>health</b> <b>check-ups</b> and family screening were detected at an earlier age and had the highest rate of survival. Liver biopsy at the time of diagnosis revealed cirrhosis in 9 % of those detected through the <b>health</b> <b>check-ups</b> and 5 % in the case of family screening, compared with 13 % for the group with arthralgia, 17 % for other diseases/symptoms and 42 % for liver disease. Conclusion. <b>Health</b> <b>check-ups</b> and family screening allow detection of hereditary hemochromatosis at an earlier age and with less advanced liver fibrosis, although a few of these patients have already developed cirrhosis. Our study indicates that iron indices should be included in <b>health</b> <b>check-ups,</b> and if abnormal, should lead to further investigation...|$|R
