40|$|Community {{indicators}} {{are used to}} assess the state of ecological communities and to guide management. They are usually calculated from monitoring data, often collected annually. Since any given community indicator provides a univariate summary of complex multivariate phenomena, different changes in the community may lead to the same response in the indicator. Sampling variation can also mask ecologically important trends. This study addresses these challenges for community indicators, with a focus on the large fish indicator (LFI), internationally used to report status of marine fish communities. The LFI expresses ‘large’ fish biomass as a proportion of total fish biomass and is calculated from species–size–abundance data collected on trawl surveys. We develop new methods to decompose the contributions of species, sampling locations and season to trends over time in the LFI, and highlight consequences for assessment and management. Our results showed that both species and locations made divergent contributions to overall trends in the LFI indicator, with contributions differing by several orders of magnitude and in sign. Only small proportions of species and locations drove overall LFI trends, and their contributions changed with season (spring and autumn surveys). To assess significance of component trends, a resampling method was developed. Our method can be generalized and applied to many other community indicators based on survey data. Synthesis and applications. Our new method for decomposing community indicators and generating confidence intervals makes it possible to extract much more information on what drives a ‘headline’ indicator, providing a solution to challenges arising from multiple possible interpretations of changes in the indicator and from sampling variation. Analysis of the effects of indicator components on <b>headline</b> <b>indicator</b> values is recommended, because the results allow assessors and managers to identify and interpret how divergent factors (e. g. species, sampling locations and seasons) contribute to the <b>headline</b> <b>indicator</b> value...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The EU {{recently}} emphasised {{the need}} {{to speed up the}} pace of reforms to improve the state of the environment both in Europe and internationally. This becomes in particular challenging, as the ‘Lisbon Strategy ’ defines the general goal of an annual economic growth rate of 3 %. Decoupling of economic growth from the use of natural resources and the production of waste and emissions is regarded as the core strategy to reconcile environmental protection and continued economic growth. However, measurable policy targets are to a large extent, missing. Furthermore, a comprehensive <b>headline</b> <b>indicator</b> for the evaluation of progress towards an absolute reduction of environmental pressures is missing in the Lisbon indicator set. We use the concept of societal metabolism as a framework for deriving priority environmental policy themes for decoupling efforts. A mix of policy instruments is suggested for achieving the overarching target of absolute decoupling through dematerialisation (quantity) and detoxification (quality) of production and consumption activities...|$|E

40|$|Developments in the {{headline}} budget balance are distorted by temporary factors. The most significant {{of these factors}} are the business cycle and creative accounting. Adequate information and estimates are available, allowing us to filter out these factors using a so-called adjustment for self-reversal. Expenditures and revenues adjusted in this way, however, continue to fluctuate, as fiscal policy measures can, in part, also {{turn out to be}} temporary in retrospect. We filter out this effect by using a four-year moving average (covering a full election cycle), instead of taking individual pieces of information into account. Moving averages are calculated in a forward-looking manner, for the three subsequent years in addition to the current year. This allows temporary effects in the past to be captured and renders their identification easier over the forecast horizon. Based on our results, the deficit indicators obtained using the adjustment for self-reversal and the adjustment for policy reversal are similar; the latter method, however, yields a higher deficit for the period 2010 – 2012, due to the tax cuts (phasing out of temporary taxes) announced for 2013.

The model is based on an indicator framework for analysing Indigenous disadvantage developed by the Productivity Commission (2003), in which headline indicators identify multiple areas of disadvantage and strategic change indicators represent possible causes of disadvantage which can be targeted by policy makers. The impact on headline indicators of strategic change indicators and other possible causal variables is estimated by a system of simultaneous equations using data from the 2002 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey (NATSISS). A variety of econometric techniques have been employed including the use of replicate weights, due to the complex survey design of NATSISS, and bivariate probit and control function approaches to control for endogeneity bias. Estimation results are discussed in terms of the significance and marginal effects of explanatory variables on each <b>headline</b> <b>indicator</b> of Indigenous disadvantage.

40|$|Material flow-based {{indicators}} play {{an important}} role in indicator sets related to green and resource-efficient growth. This paper examines the global flows of materials and the amounts of materials directly and indirectly necessary to satisfy domestic final demand in different countries world-wide. We calculate the indicator Raw Material Consumption (RMC), also referred to as Material Footprint (MF), by applying a global, multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model based on the GTAP database and extended by material extraction data. We examine world-wide patterns of material extraction and materials embodied in trade and consumption, investigating changes between 1997 and 2007. We find that flows of materials related to international trade have increased by almost 60 % between 1997 and 2007. We show that the differences in Material Footprints per capita are huge, ranging from up to 100 tonnes in the rich, oil-exporting countries to values as low as 1. 5 to 2 tonnes in some developing countries. We also quantify the differences between the indicators Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) and RMC, illustrating that net material exporters generally have a DMC larger than RMC, while the reverse is observed for net importers. Finally, we confirm the fact that most countries with stable or declining DMCs actually show increasing RMCs, indicating the occurrence of leakage effects, which are not fully captured by DMC. This challenges the world-wide use of DMC as a <b>headline</b> <b>indicator</b> for national material consumption and calls for the consideration of upstream material requirements of international trade flows...|$|E

40|$|This paper, which {{represents}} the living standards domain of the new Canadian Index of Wellbeing, provides a comprehensive overview of trends {{in a number of}} indicators of living standards over the 1981 - 2008 period in Canada. Part one examines trends in average and median income and wealth indicators in Canada. Part two looks at the distribution of the income and wealth of Canadians over time, including trends in poverty. Part three discusses trends in income fluctuations or volatility. Part four analyzes trends in the economic security of Canadians, including labour market security, food security, housing security, and the security provided by the social safety net. The report also presents a synthesis of overall trends in living standards, discusses living standard measurement issues, and puts forward a set of <b>headline</b> <b>indicators</b> to capture the essentials of what has been happening to the living standards of Canadians. Finally, the report comments on the sustainability of current levels of living standards. The report provides a comprehensive examination {{of a large number of}} indicators of living standards in Canada over the last quarter century and has identified a number of these <b>indicators</b> as <b>headline</b> <b>indicators</b> for the new Canadian Index of Wellbeing. The bottom line is that Canada has become a much richer country, but the top quintile has received the lion’s share of rising income and wealth. Looking at the nine <b>headline</b> <b>indicators</b> for which time series are available, one can immediately see that living standards of Canadians have not unambiguously improved between 1981 and 2008. Indeed, Canadians experienced a widening of income and wealth inequalities. There have been poverty reductions, but the reductions were not nearly as large as the increase in wealth inequality. The unemployment rate is down to a record low for the 1981 - 2008 period, and yet the incidence of long-term unemployment is higher now than in 1981. Economic security measured by the CSLS index has also fallen, spurred by a significant decrease in economic security caused by the financial risk associated with illness. Since 1981, many dimensions of living standards in Canada have not improved, and that in spite of a 52. 6 per cent surge in gross domestic product per capita. Looking forward, the challenges for Canada’s policymakers are significant, but need to be tackled if Canada is to become a fairer, healthier and richer country.

40|$|The {{scientific}} community currently {{deals with the}} challenge of measuring sustainable development by using long lists of core set indicator. These are then used in one of two ways: either shortened sets of <b>headline</b> <b>indicators</b> are selected (these vary by sector or theme), or an aggregation procedure is adopted that allows the creation of unique integrated indices, such as the well known ISEW, HDI, PPI. Recent work has demonstrated that most countries prefer to develop their own approaches over and above the accepted international standards, in some cases adapting these standard approaches, whilst seeking to strike a delicate balance between, on the one hand, globally accepted environmental and socio-economic indicators and, on the other, national and local peculiarities. The imperative in such cases is to avoid losing international comparability. The choice must take account of the varying space and time scales of each country with regard to sustainable development, as well as the role of the national policymakers in selecting the approach to sustainability. This paper introduces the ISSI index which is based on three baskets: welfare, environmental quality and resource use each one defined by a limited set of <b>headline</b> <b>indicators.</b> A combination algorithm is then proposed which gives a global, integrated non-dimensional index, which allows comparisons between the Italian regions as well as between countries.

40|$|Recognizing the {{imperative}} need for biodiversity protection, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has recently established new targets towards 2020, the so-called Aichi targets, and updated proposed sets of indicators to quantitatively monitor the progress towards these targets. Remote sensing has been increasingly contributing to timely, accurate, and cost-effective assessment of biodiversity-related characteristics and functions {{during the last}} years. However, most relevant studies constitute individual research efforts, rarely related with the extraction of widely adopted CBD biodiversity indicators. Furthermore, systematic operational use of remote sensing data by managing authorities has still been limited. In this study, the Aichi targets and the related CBD indicators whose monitoring can be facilitated by remote sensing are identified.

40|$|This brief proposes the {{consideration}} of a Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2. 0 (now known as the MPI 2015 +) in post- 2015 MDGs, as a <b>headline</b> <b>indicator</b> of multidimensional poverty that can reflect participatory inputs, and can be easily disaggregated. Most projections suggest ending $ 1. 25 /day poverty would not require {{much in the way}} of bending the current trend – so it is achievable. But ending $ 1. 25 /day poverty is unlikely to mean the end of the many overlapping disadvantages faced by people living in poverty, including malnutrition, poor sanitation, a lack of electricity, or ramshackle schools. This brief considers what the MPI, reflecting acute multidimensional poverty, could offer in the context of the post- 2015 MDG discussions. Granted there will be other goals – for example, to improve health – each having a bevy of indicators. Yet alongside these, a headline MPI could provide an eye-catching and intuitive overview measure, with easily understood and consistent details on its component indicators. Indeed, an MPI 2015 + could be formed from a ‘voices of the poor’ type participatory exercise. The MPI 2015 + would complement a $ 1. 25 /day measure by showing how people are poor (what disadvantages they experience); in which regions or ethnic groups they are poor; and the inequalities between those living in poverty. It would add value for policymakers, providing political incentives to reduce poverty by reflecting changes swiftly; it could also be used to monitor inclusive growth, and to show the nexus between challenges of poverty and sustainability.

40|$|The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) {{has been}} an {{important}} contribution to the debate on national and international poverty measurement. With the creation of the global MPI, OHPI and UNDP have provided a household-level multidimensional poverty measure for over 100 developing countries that can usefully complement the widely used $ 1. 25 a day income poverty indicator. Given its link to the concept of human development, it is an important element of the suite of human development indicators maintained and published by UNDP. Nonetheless, there are many open empirical questions and issues regarding the conceptual underpinning of the MPI that need to be discussed and carefully considered. This essay discusses issues with the dual cut-off method for poverty identification, and how inequality could be incorporated in this poverty measure. Moreover, the choice of <b>headline</b> <b>indicator</b> is debated. We also propose a number of changes regarding the empirical implementation. These include dropping the WHS as one of the data sources, dropping the BMI as a nutrition indicator, and changing the age ranges and cutoffs for the education and mortality indicators. Different approaches to deal with the large share of households where information on an MPI indicator is missing are also discussed. The empirical relevance of these changes are analysed using the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for Armenia, Ethiopia, and India. We argue that these changes could pose improvements to the current formulation, but one may need to investigate them further and for a larger number of countries. In a final section, we briefly comment on the HDRO revisions to the MPI in the 2014 Human Development Report, which have been partly based on the recommendations made in this paper...|$|E
