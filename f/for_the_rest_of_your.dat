His father had {{arranged}} the job (and similar jobs for his brother and sister) to give Barrowman the experience of manual labour. His father told him: [...] "If {{you want to do}} manual labour <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life you'll know that when you do it; it's a choice. But if you don't like it, you'll understand the importance of educating yourself and – if you decide {{what you want to do}} – being good at your craft or your skill." [...] Barrowman worked for the power company for the entire summer, but did not like the job. Eventually, he convinced the company to move him to work in the storeroom.|$|E

[...] Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together. The suggestions were met with disapproval from Shields, who felt {{such a move would}} have [...] "divided [...] life too much". She recalled: [...] "There were times when he would ask me to marry him, and I would say, 'You have me <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life, you don’t need to marry me, I’m going to go on...have my own marriage and my own kids, and you’ll always have me.' I think it made him relax. He didn’t want to lose things that meant something to him." ...|$|E

He demands that Liz fire Josh, but she refuses, so instead she tries to fix the situation, but Tracy threatens to go to Jack if she does not.

500|$|The Iron Giant {{primarily}} {{deals with}} the concept of existentialism, as well as the nature of humanity.

500|$|Delany {{auditioned for}} the role of Bree for the series' pilot episode in 2004. Cherry offered her the role three times, but she {{rejected}} it, and Marcia Cross was hired soon after. Delany turned down the role because she believed the Bree character was too similar to her character on Pasadena. Cherry acknowledged that while Delany captured the slyness he had originally intended for the character, Cross ultimately became the better choice: [...] "Marcia, who {{will be the first to}} tell you, 'I'm not funny, I never get the joke,' her Bree was kind of oblivious to her own Breeness. Interestingly enough, when we went forward with the show, it became a much funnier character than I envisioned." [...] While developing the Katherine character, Cherry immediately offered the role to Delany. [...] "That's unusual in Hollywood," [...] Delany commented. [...] "Usually when you say 'no,' they hold it against you <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> career. I've experienced that." ...|$|E

500|$|IGN {{gave the}} games a 9/10, a higher rating {{than any of}} the other Nintendo DS Pokémon games. The review praised the games for {{renewing}} interest in the series, though criticized some of the new Pokémon designs, explaining that [...] "aside from a weaker lineup of monsters (largely an aesthetic complaint), this is the best Pokémon has to offer on every level, renewing my waning interest in monster battling". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized Black and White, commenting that he grew tired of it shortly after starting and feeling like it was too similar to all previous Pokémon games. He further went on to say that EVs and IVs, invisible mechanics in the game, are not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, he noted that it would be great to new players. He also compared it to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games and Final Fantasy XIII, arguing that they all share the common element of being bad before they get good. Fellow Retronauts contributor Justin Haywald criticized the games' release on the DS, which had received two main Pokémon series games published before them. GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson stated [...] "It may not break the Pokemon mold, but Black/White offers enough new content coupled with the series' classic, deep battle mechanics to make it endlessly playable. If you could only play one game <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life, this would be a wise choice." ...|$|E
500|$|Jones {{was cast}} as Rooney {{based on his}} role in Amadeus, where he played the emperor; Hughes thought that character's modern {{equivalent}} was Rooney. [...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to me was that I {{was the only one who}} wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So I was the only one in opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — and I thought he was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This is the guy I want you to pay close attention to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP's coat momentarily flew open revealing a holster and gun attached to the man's belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned."The guy was 'Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you!'" [...] Jones exclaimed.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not age or age very little, and as such, the show is always assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events {{have been linked to}} specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Bart's year of birth was stated in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] (season three, 1991) as being in the early 1980s. In [...] "Simpsorama" [...] (season 26, 2014) Bart states his birthday as February 23. He lived with his parents in the Lower East Side of Springfield until the Simpsons bought their first house. When Lisa was born, Bart was at first jealous of the attention she received, but he soon warmed to her when he discovered that [...] "Bart" [...] was her first word. Bart's first day of school was in the early 1990s. His initial enthusiasm was crushed by an uncaring teacher and Marge became worried that something was truly wrong with Bart. One day during recess, Bart met Milhouse and started entertaining him and other students with various gestures and rude words. Principal Skinner told him [...] "you've just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life! Now, what do you say?" [...] In his moment of truth, Bart responded, [...] "eat my shorts". The episode [...] "That '90s Show" [...] (season nineteen, 2008) contradicted much of the backstory's time frame; for example, it was revealed that Homer and Marge were childless in the early 1990s.|$|E

500|$|At first, Nevermind did {{not receive}} many reviews, and many {{publications}} ignored the album. Months after its release and after [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] garnered airplay, print media organizations were [...] "scrambling" [...] to cover the phenomenon the album had become. However, by that point, much of the attention fell on Cobain rather than the album itself. The reviews that did initially appear were largely positive. Karen Schoemer of The New York Times wrote, [...] "With 'Nevermind,' Nirvana has certainly succeeded. There are enough intriguing textures, mood shifts, instrumental snippets and inventive word plays to provide for hours of entertainment." [...] Schoemer concluded, [...] "'Nevermind' is more sophisticated and carefully produced than anything peer bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Mudhoney have yet offered." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave Nevermind an A– rating, and reviewer David Browne argued that on Nevermind, Nirvana [...] "never entertain the notion" [...] of wanting to sound [...] "normal," [...] compared to other contemporary alternative bands. Concluding his very enthusiastic review for the British Melody Maker, Everett True wrote that [...] "When Nirvana released Bleach all those years ago, the more sussed among us figured they {{had the potential to}} make an album that would blow every other contender away. My God have they proved us right." [...] Spin gave Nevermind a favorable review stating that [...] "you'll be humming all the songs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life—or at least until your CD-tape-album wears out." [...] Select compared the band to Jane's Addiction, Sonic Youth, and the Pixies, stating that the album [...] "proves that Nirvana truly belong in such high company." ...|$|E

Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder {{remained}} in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they [...] "wanted everything to feel like real time... As soon as you woke up, the cameras would be on you. I look knackered." [...] During filming, he contracted swine flu, but insisted that all he needed was a 30-minute break before filming, attributing his ability to continue acting to adrenaline. He noted that [...] "I just said, 'No, no, no. We'll carry on. I'll just stop eating.' I was completely purged during the making of that film. Afterwards, during the edit, I started to feel a lot calmer." [...] Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic, noting that [...] "When I was 14, I had– let's call it an existential crisis. I wondered if [...] was a case of me destroying that part of me. If you do have a breakdown that young, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life you're very aware of it.

In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. Cassie becomes hospitalized and escapes to find Daniel to tell him she was driving, but is soon re-admitted. During the May 24 episode, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Case also found taping the scenes devastating: [...] "It was too real for Joshua and me to even go through it. We did it in one take. [...] The scene is still devastating in my mind and Joshua’s. [...] It’s almost not watchable. [...] If it comes on, I can’t get through it". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. According to Case, when Sharon loses something in her life it [...] "reminds her and reactivates Cassie’s death for her". After Nick cheats on Sharon following Cassie's death, Case said it [...] "makes you so fearful {{that you are going to}} be alone <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life; that no matter what you go out in life to create, it’s going to be ruined anyway".
