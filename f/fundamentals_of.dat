There are many diagrams originate in the 12th and 13th centuries. When examined closely, many similarities between Eurasian machines can be drawn. Since the Jin dynasty, the existence of silk damasks has been well recorded, and since the 2nd century BCE, four-shafted looms and other innovations allowed the creation of silk brocades.|$|E
5|$|Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky {{was educated}} {{for a career}} as a civil servant. There was scant {{opportunity}} for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other <b>fundamentals</b> <b>of</b> Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career.|$|E

40|$|Background. The group-theoretical {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>fundamental</b> solutions <b>of</b> the one-dimensional linear Kramers equation {{was carried}} out in the article. Objective. The aim of the paper is to find the algebra <b>of</b> invariance <b>of</b> <b>fundamental</b> solutions <b>of</b> the equation under study using the Aksenov-Berest approach, and construct a <b>fundamental</b> solution <b>of</b> the one in the explicit form taking into account the algebra of Lie symmetries to be found. Methods. The group-theoretical methods of analysis of partial differential equations are used. In particular, the Aksenov-Berest method of constructing in explicit form <b>of</b> <b>fundamental</b> solutions <b>of</b> linear partial differential equations is applied. Results. The Lie algebra of non-trivial symmetries of the one-dimensional linear Kramers equation under consider was found. The fundamental solution in the explicit form of the equation was constructed. The effectiveness of using of symmetry methods in investigating <b>of</b> <b>fundamental</b> solutions <b>of</b> linear Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equations was shown. Conclusions. Using the Aksenov-Berest approach, the algebra <b>of</b> invariance <b>of</b> <b>fundamental</b> solutions <b>of</b> one onedimensional linear Kramers equation was found. The operators of the algebra were used in the process of constructing <b>of</b> invariant <b>fundamental</b> solutions <b>of</b> the equation. It was shown that the fundamental solution found early by S. Chandrasekhar without using the methods of symmetry analysis of differential equations is the weak invariant fundamental solution. ????????????. ? ?????? ???????? ?????????-????????? ?????? ??????????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ????????. ???? ????????????. ????????? ????? ????????????????, ????? ??????? ?????????????? ??????????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????, ? ????? ????????? ??????????????? ??????? ????????? ? ????? ????, ????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????. ???????? ??????????. ???????????? ?????? ?????????-?????????? ??????? ???????????????? ????????? ? ???????? ????????????, ? ????????? ????? ???????????????? ?????????? ? ????? ???? ??????????????? ??????? ???????? ???????????????? ?????????. ?????????? ????????????. ??????? ??????? ?? ????????????? ????????? ???????????? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ????????. ????????? ? ????? ???? ? ???????????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????? ????? ?????????. ???????? ????????????? ????????????? ???????????? ??????? ??? ???????????? ??????????????? ??????? ???????? ????????? ??????????????????????????. ??????. ? ?????????????? ?????? ???????????????? ??????? ??????? ?????????????? ??????????????? ??????? ?????? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ????????, ????????? ??????? ???? ???????????? ??? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????????? ??????? ????? ?????????. ????????, ??? ??????????????? ??????? ????? ?????????, ????????? ????? ?. ????????????? ??? ????????????? ??????? ????????????? ??????? ???????????????? ?????????, ???????? ???????????? ??????????????? ????????...|$|R
5|$|Artist Takayoshi Sato {{corrected}} {{inconsistencies in}} the plot, and designed the game's cast of characters. As a young employee, Sato was initially restricted to basic {{tasks such as}} font design and file sorting. He also created 3D demos and presentations, and taught older staff members the <b>fundamentals</b> <b>of</b> 3D modeling. However, he was not credited for this work as {{he did not have}} as much respect within Konami as older employees. Sato eventually approached the company's higher-ups with a short demo movie he had rendered, and threatened to withhold this technical knowledge from other staff members if he was not assigned to 3D work. As a consequence, his superior had to give in to his demand, and he was allowed to do character designs. Instead of relying on illustrations, Sato conceived the characters of Silent Hill while creating their computer-generated models. He gave each their own distinctive characteristics, but made Harry almost completely neutral as he wanted to avoid forcing interpretations of the game on the players. Creating the skull shapes for the faces of the American cast was difficult because he had no Caucasian co-workers to use for reference. Although Sato was largely responsible for the game's cinematics and characters at this point, his superior still did not want to fully credit his work, and intended to assign a visual supervisor to him. To prevent this from happening, Sato volunteered to create the full-motion videos of Silent Hill by himself. Over the course of two and a half years, he lived in the development team's office, as he had to render the scenes with the approximately 150 Unix-based computers of his coworkers after they left work {{at the end of a}} day.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Baden-Powell was {{assigned}} to the Matabeleland region in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) as Chief of Staff to Gen. Frederick Carrington during the Second Matabele War, and it was here (in June, 1896) that he first met and began a lifelong friendship with Frederick Russell Burnham, the American-born Chief of Scouts for the British Army in Africa. This was a formative experience for Baden-Powell not only because he had the time of his life commanding reconnaissance missions into enemy territory, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas took hold here. During their joint scouting patrols into the Matobo Hills, Burnham augmented Baden-Powell's woodcraft skills, inspiring him and sowing seeds for both the programme and for the code of honour later published in Scouting for Boys. Practised by frontiersmen of the American Old West and Indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally little known to the British Army but well-known to the American scout Burnham. These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called scoutcraft, the <b>fundamentals</b> <b>of</b> Scouting. Both men recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. It was also during this time in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham, and it was here that Baden-Powell acquired his Kudu horn, the Ndebele war instrument he later used every morning at Brownsea Island to wake the first Boy Scouts and to call them together in training courses.|$|E
