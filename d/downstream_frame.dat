40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this {{contribution}} is to define an upstream synchronization technique using Timebase Markers to synchronize upstream TDMA transmission.

40|$|The {{sequence}} of a 5 '-proximal region of mRNA 5 of coronavirus MHV-JHM {{was determined by}} chain-terminator sequencing of cDNA subcloned in M 13. The sequence contained two long open reading frames of 321 bases and 264 bases, overlapping by five bases but in different frames. Both open reading frames are initiated by AUG codons in sequence contexts that are relatively infrequently used as initiator codons. The smaller, <b>downstream</b> open reading <b>frame</b> encoded a neutral protein (mol. wt. 10200) with a hydrophobic amino terminus. The larger, 5 '-proximal open reading frame encoded a basic protein (tool. wt. 12400) which lacks internal methionine residues. With {{the exception of the}} AUG codon initiating the <b>downstream</b> open reading <b>frame,</b> no internal AUG codons were found within the sequence overed by the upstream open reading frame. These results suggest that the MHV-JHM mRNA 5 is translated to produce two proteins by a mechanism involving internal initiation of protein synthesis.

The pla 1 - 5 mutant has a dwarf phenotype and small leaves. Compared with its wild type, pla 1 - 5 has more leaves and fewer tillers, and {{it fails to}} produce normal panicles at the maturity stage. Genetic analysis showed that the pla 1 - 5 phenotype is controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene. Using the map-based cloning strategy, we narrowed down {{the location of the}} target gene to a 58 -kb region between simple sequence repeat markers CHR 1027 and CHR 1030 on the long arm of chromosome 10. The target gene cosegregated with molecular markers CHR 1028 and CHR 1029. There were five predicted genes in the mapped region.

With advances in optical and computational technologies, image and video analysis is becoming an increasingly important tool in biological, medical and defense applications. Motion characteristics and behaviors of objects can be studied from image sequences, such as the spatio-temporal behavior of cells and organisms in microscopy videos or vehicles and people in surveillance videos. Manual supervised and automatic object tracking are used to study migration, lineage, cellular events and population scale dynamics in microscopy applications and multi-target behavior in defense applications.

50|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is caused when a mutation in the dystrophin gene changes the RNA {{so that it}} no longer codes for functional dystrophin protein. This usually happens due to a mutation that alters the reading frame of the RNA downstream of the mutation, so-called frameshift mutation. If an exon with an appropriate number of bases lies near the mutation, removing that exon can correct the <b>downstream</b> reading <b>frame,</b> restoring the production of partially functional dystrophin. This is the general strategy used in the design of exon-skipping oligonucleotides for DMD. As there are 79 exons in the longest splice form of the dystrophin transcript, many different oligonucleotides are needed to address the range of mutations present in the population of people with DMD.|$|R
40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{transcription}} and translation procedure was designed to translate multiple open reading frames from cloned DNAs. For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cloned DNA carrying three open reading frames (sor, tat, and 3 '-orf), the approach yielded three authentic polypeptides. Clearly, the internal initiation codons {{can be used for}} reinitiation of translation of the <b>downstream</b> open reading <b>frames.</b> However, the <b>downstream</b> open reading <b>frames</b> were translated with relatively lower translational efficiencies. In general, the translational efficiency of RNAs depended significantly on their structures. The in vitro approach was utilized further to map the immunoreactive domains of the 3 '-orf and sor gene products of HIV. Deletion clones were constructed with deletions within the open reading frames. Translation products of these clones reacted differentially with anti- 3 '-orf and anti-sor rabbit immune sera and human sera from individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and related disorders. Apparently, recombinant 3 '-orf and sor polypeptides used to immunize rabbits express many more immunogenic epitopes and/or different set of epitopes than is the case for the native proteins in humans infected with HIV. Immunoreactivity and immunogenicity of these gene products were significantly dependent on their structure and/or conformation...|$|R

When SAM is present in high concentration, SAM-II will bind its ligand and form a terminator stem to halt transcription. If SAM exists in lower concentrations, SAM-V will be transcribed and, if SAM concentration should then increase, it can bind SAM and occlude the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the <b>downstream</b> open reading <b>frame.</b> This regulation controls parts of the sulfur metabolism of marine bacteria.|$|R

Translation efficiency of the immediate <b>downstream</b> open reading <b>frame</b> (ORF) decreased with increasing URF length.

40|$|In the mycobacterial plasmid pAL 5000 {{replication}} region, the replication genes repA and repB {{are organized}} in an operon. Earlier, a RepB-dependent origin binding activity was detected in Escherichia coli cells expressing the repA-repB operon. This activity was maximal when {{expression of the}} two genes was coupled (A. Basu, M. Chawla-Sarkar, S. Chakrabarti, and S. K. Das Gupta, J. Bacteriol. 184 : 2204 - 2214, 2002). In this study we have shown that translational coupling makes {{a significant difference in}} the structure and function of RepB. When repB expression was coupled to repA, the polypeptide folded into an active structure (referred to as RepB*), which possessed higher helical content than RepB expressed independently. RepB* could also be distinguished from the less active RepB on the basis of sensitivity to OmpT, an outer membrane protease of E. coli: RepB* was sensitive to the protease, whereas RepB was resistant. Similar conformational differences between RepB* and RepB could be observed when repA was replaced with an unrelated gene, malE (encoding maltose binding protein). These results show that translational coupling of repB to an upstream gene is necessary for better folding and origin binding activity. It is speculated that in coupled systems where translation machinery is passed on from the upstream to the <b>downstream</b> open reading <b>frame,</b> cotranslational folding of the polypeptide expressed from the <b>downstream</b> open reading <b>frame</b> is enhanced due to increased folding competence of translationally primed ribosomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{second of}} three short {{upstream}} open reading frames (uORF 2) in the transcript {{leader of the}} human cytomegalovirus gp 48 (gpUL 4) virion glycoprotein gene inhibits downstream translation approximately 10 -fold. Remarkably, this inhibition depends on the amino acid coding information of uORF 2. In the current studies we demonstrate that expression of the cistron downstream from uORF 2 depends on ribosomes bypassing the uORF 2 AUG codon (AUG 2) by a leaky scanning mechanism. Replacing the nucleotides surrounding the wild-type AUG 2 codon with those optimal for translation initiation reduces downstream translation approximately 10 -fold. Analyses of mutants in which uORF 2 either overlaps or is in <b>frame</b> with the <b>downstream</b> reading <b>frame</b> reveal that the initiation frequency at the wild-type AUG 2 codon is surprisingly low; rather, the majority of ribosomal subunits bypass the wild-type AUG 2 codon because of its suboptimal context.

40|$|In retroviruses and the {{double-stranded}} RNA totiviruses, {{the efficiency}} of programmed − 1 ribosomal frameshifting is critical for ensuring the proper ratios of upstream-encoded capsid proteins to downstream-encoded replicase enzymes. The genomic organizations of many other frameshifting viruses, including the coronaviruses, are very different, in that their upstream open reading frames encode nonstructural proteins, the frameshift-dependent <b>downstream</b> open reading <b>frames</b> encode enzymes involved in transcription and replication, and their structural proteins are encoded by subgenomic mRNAs. The biological significance of frameshifting efficiency and how the relative ratios of proteins encoded by the upstream and <b>downstream</b> open reading <b>frames</b> affect virus propagation has not been explored before. Here, three different strategies were employed {{to test the hypothesis}} that the − 1 PRF signals of coronaviruses have evolved to produce the correct ratios of upstream- to downstream-encoded proteins. Specifically, infectious clones of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) -associated coronavirus harboring mutations that lower frameshift efficiency decreased infectivity by > 4 orders of magnitude. Second, a series of frameshift-promoting mRNA pseudoknot mutants was employed to demonstrate that the frameshift signals of the SARS-associated coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus have evolved to promote optimal frameshift efficiencies. Finally, we show that a previously described frameshift attenuator element does not actually affect frameshifting per se but rather serves to limit the fraction of ribosomes available for frameshifting. The findings of these analyses all support a “golden mean” model in which viruses use both programmed ribosomal frameshifting and translational attenuation to control the relative ratios of their encoded proteins...|$|R

The kdsA gene was transcribed {{as part of a}} polycistronic mRNA with two <b>downstream</b> open reading <b>frames</b> (ORFs).

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{reported here}} provide strong evidence {{indicating that the}} transposition frequency of the bacterial insertion sequence IS 1 is determined principally by two IS 1 -specified proteins. The first, InsA, was previously shown to bind {{to the ends of}} the element and to act as a repressor. We present both physical and genetic evidence which reveals that the second, the InsAB' transposase, is a fusion of InsA with the product of a <b>downstream</b> reading <b>frame,</b> InsB'. Synthesis of this protein occurs by a - 1 frameshift between the insA and insB' frames. It requires the presence of an intact retroviral-like frameshift signal composed of an A 6 C motif and a downstream region able to form several alternative secondary structures. In vivo studies show that IS 1 transposition activity depends on the relative rather than on the absolute levels of InsA and InsAB'. The ratio is determined primarily at the translational level by frameshifting and appears to be relatively insensitive to large variations in levels of transcription. This novel homeostatic control could therefore protect IS 1 from activation as a consequence of insertion into active transcription units...|$|R
40|$|The IEEE 802. 11 p-based {{wireless}} access networks {{are about to}} be deployed by major highways around the world as one of the main information hauling infrastructure for ITS safety applications. As the most applications of the IEEE 802. 11 p standard require the delivery of short text-based messages, the standard does not support handover between adjacent Road-side Units (RSUs). However, demand for seamless real-time services such as short video clips of CCTVs on a highway gives rise to support for handover in the IEE 802. 11 p-based {{wireless access}} systems. In this paper, we describe a seamless handover scheme for an IEEE 802. 11 p-based wireless access system that takes advantage of the fixed-order placement of the RSUs and unidirectional movement of the vehicles along the highways. More specifically, this handover scheme utilizes the IEEE 802. 11 disassociation message as to signal the old RSU of an On-broad Unit’s (OBU) departure from its coverage area. The subsequent <b>downstream</b> data <b>frames</b> can be proactively forwarded to the new RSU for delivery to the OBU after its link establishment with the new RSU.

The HupT protein of 456 amino acids (48, 414 Da) has sequence similarity with the FixL, DctB, NtrB, and ArcB proteins and is predicted to be a soluble sensor kinase. Insertional inactivation of the hupT gene led to deregulation of transcriptional control, so that the hydrogenase structural operon hupSLC became overexpressed in cells grown anaerobically or aerobically. The HupT- mutants were complemented in trans by a plasmid containing an intact copy of the hupT gene.

These genes are predicted to encode polypeptides of 879, 459 and 345 amino acids, respectively. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of CHV gB, gC and gD with the homologous sequences from other herpesviruses indicates that CHV is an alphaherpesvirus, a conclusion {{that is consistent with}} the previous classification of this virus according to biological properties. Alignment of the homologous gB, gC and gD amino acid sequences indicates that most of the cysteine residues are conserved, suggesting that these glycoproteins possess similar tertiary structures. The {{nucleotide sequence}} of the open reading <b>frame</b> <b>downstream</b> from the CHV gC gene was also determined.

40|$|A cryptic prokaryotic promoter, {{designated}} AV 3 promoter, {{has been}} previously identified in certain begomovirus genus, including ageratum yellow vein virus isolate NT (AYVV-NT). In this study, we demonstrated that the core nucleotides in the putative - 10 and - 35 boxes are necessary but not sufficient for promoter activity in Escherichia coli, and showed that AYVV-NT AV 3 promoter could specifically interact with single-stranded DNA-binding protein and sigma 70 of E. coli involved in transcription. Several AYVV-NT-encoded proteins were found to increase the activity of AV 3 promoter. The transcription start sites downstream to AV 3 promoter were mapped to nucleotide positions 803 or 805 in E. coli, and 856 in Nicotiana benthamiana. The eukaryotic activity of AV 3 promoter and the translatability of a short <b>downstream</b> open reading <b>frame</b> were further confirmed by using a green fluorescent protein reporter construct in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells. These results suggested that AV 3 promoter might be a remnant of evolution that retained cryptic activity at present...|$|R

Several previously predicted splice sites such as that for E 3 - 14. 5 K and E 4 ORF 3 / 4 were not detected. In addition, several new splice sites were identified. The novel RNAs may code for hitherto undetected proteins or alternatively spliced mRNAs for known proteins.

40|$|The {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor gene {{has been found to}} be amplified and rearranged in human glioblastomas in vivo. Here we present the sequence across a splice junction of aberrant {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor transcripts derived from corresponding and uniquely rearranged genes that are coamplified and coexpressed with non-rearranged epidermal growth factor receptor genes in six primary human glioblastomas. Each of these six tumors contains aberrant transcripts derived from identical splicing of exon 1 to exon 8 as a consequence of a deletion-rearrangement of the amplified gene, the extent of which is variable among these tumors. In spite of this intertumoral variability, each intragenic rearrangement results in loss of the same 801 coding bases (exons 2 - 7) and creation of a new codon at the novel splice site in their corresponding transcripts.
