25|$|A {{photomultiplier}} is a phototube whose sensitivity {{is greatly}} increased {{through the use}} of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of secondary emission, whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a dynode causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated toward another dynode at a higher voltage, releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid-state photodetectors, the single-photon detection capability of photomultiplier tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of ionizing radiation {{as an alternative to the}} Geiger–Müller tube (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.|$|E

The statuette weighs 5 pounds and is composed of iron, pewter, zinc and gold.|$|E
500|$|In 1960 Philips invented an imaging tube {{called the}} Plumbicon {{to replace the}} vidicon and <b>Image</b> <b>Orthicon</b> tubes used in studio {{television}} cameras. The technical advantages of this new tube allowed true color fidelity {{to be seen in}} television broadcasts for the first time. In 1967 the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences presented Philips with an Emmy Award for [...] "Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development" [...] for the invention of the Plumbicon tube.|$|E
50|$|Plumbicon is a {{registered}} trademark of Philips for its Lead(II) oxide (PbO) target vidicons. Used frequently in broadcast camera applications, these tubes have low output, but a high signal-to-noise ratio. They had excellent resolution compared to <b>Image</b> <b>Orthicons,</b> but lacked the artificially sharp edges of IO tubes, which caused some of the viewing audience to perceive them as softer. CBS Labs invented the first outboard edge enhancement circuits to sharpen the edges of Plumbicon generated images.|$|R
25|$|Getters act by {{chemically}} {{combining with}} residual or infiltrating gases, but {{are unable to}} counteract (non-reactive) inert gases. A known problem, mostly affecting valves with large envelopes such as cathode ray tubes and camera tubes such as iconoscopes, <b>orthicons,</b> and <b>image</b> <b>orthicons,</b> comes from helium infiltration. The effect appears as impaired or absent functioning, and as a diffuse glow along the electron stream inside the tube. This effect cannot be rectified (short of re-evacuation and resealing), and is responsible for working examples of such tubes becoming rarer and rarer. Unused ("New Old Stock") tubes can also exhibit inert gas infiltration, {{so there is no}} long-term guarantee of these tube types surviving into the future.|$|R
40|$|Low {{light level}} {{television}} systems offer {{the ability to}} observe meteors as faint as 10 th magnitude which allows the extension of optical meteor data to masses as small as 0. 0001 gram. The results of these observations, using <b>image</b> <b>orthicons</b> and intensified vidicons, are presented along with an interpretation in terms of mass flux. This interpretation includes {{the development of a}} relationship between peak luminosity of a meteor and mass, velocity, and zenith angle that was derived from single body meteor theory and compares favorably with results obtained from the artificial meteor program. Also included in the mass flux interpretation is an analysis of the observation response of a LLLTV system to fixed and moving point sources...|$|R
500|$|The Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series Directing Team is {{an award}} {{presented}} annually by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) and Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS). It was first awarded at the 1st Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony, held in 1974 when the award was originally called [...] Outstanding Individual Director for a Drama Series. Therefore, between 1974 and 1978; the award only honored individual directors. In 1979, the award was renamed Outstanding Direction for a Drama Series before using its current title years later. Since then, the award has honored {{the performances of}} the entire directing team participating in a form of a daytime drama. The awards ceremony was not aired on television in 1983 and 1984, having been criticized for lack of integrity. The Emmy was named after an [...] "Immy," [...] an affectionate term {{used to refer to}} the <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> camera tube.

2500|$|The studio complex, which, {{in later}} years, would be affectionately known as 'the tin shed' was planned, {{designed}} and constructed by Civil and Civic Pty. Ltd. {{over a period}} of 28 weeks (from September 1961– March 1962) at a total cost of £77,912 (A$155,824). Occupying a 9400 square metre (101,000 square feet) site, the complex featured a 140-square-metre studio area and was fitted out with RCA equipment— two 4½" [...] <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> cameras were purchased for use in the studio at a cost of £8,000 (A$16 000) each. The transmitter (whose mast was erected in March 1962) was custom-designed by Co-El of Italy, and the mast EPT Limited in Sydney.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the advent}} of low light level {{television}} (LLLTV) systems, it has been recognized that such devices offer the ability to observe meteors as faint as 10 th magnitude which allows the extension of optical meteor data to masses as small as 0. 0001 grams. The Space Sciences Lab at Marshall Space Flight Center has been actively engaged in such observations using <b>image</b> <b>orthicons</b> and intensified SEC vidicons. The results of these observations are presented along with an interpretation in terms of mass-flux.

40|$|The high {{resolution}} spectrograph (HRS) {{is designed to}} be used with the Large Space Telescope (LST) for the study of spectra of point and extended targets in the spectral range 110 to 410 nm. It has spectral resolutions of 1, 000; 30, 000; and 100, 000 and has a field of view as large as 10 arc sec. The spectral range and resolution are selectable using interchangeable optical components and an echelle spectrograph is used to display a cross dispersed spectrum on the photocathode of either of 2 SEC <b>orthicon</b> <b>image</b> tubes. Provisions are included for wavelength calibration, target identification and acquisition and thermal control. The system considerations of the instrument are described...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German {{licensee}} company Telefunken. The [...] "image iconoscope" [...] ("Superikonoskop" [...] in Germany) was produced {{as a result}} of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television) in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States. The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes. Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the <b>image</b> <b>orthicon.</b> The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955, finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 to 1958.|$|E
5000|$|Up to 1962, {{television}} studios used 3-tube <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> cameras for programmes in colour. For example, RCA {{offered the}} TK-41, GE the PC-15 and PC-25, Marconi the BD848/B3200. [...] They were all big, heavy, cameras (for example, the TK-41 with zoom lens was 5 ft long and it weighed 500 lbs). However, when properly set up, these <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> cameras could give pleasing pictures, {{which had the}} sharp crisp look that was a characteristic of the I.O. pick-up tubes (see Video camera tube - <b>Image</b> <b>orthicon).</b>|$|E

50|$|An <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> {{consists}} of three parts: a photocathode with an image store ("target"), a scanner that reads this image (an electron gun), and a multistage electron multiplier.|$|E
5000|$|While the {{iconoscope}} and {{the intermediate}} orthicon used capacitance between {{a multitude of}} small but discrete light sensitive collectors and an isolated signal plate for reading video information, the <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> employed direct charge readings from a continuous electronically charged collector. The resultant signal was immune to most extraneous signal [...] "crosstalk" [...] {{from other parts of}} the target, and could yield extremely detailed images. For instance, <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> cameras were used for capturing Apollo/Saturn rockets nearing orbit after the networks had phased them out, as only they could provide sufficient detail.|$|E
5000|$|Albert Rose (30 March 1910 [...] - [...] 26 July 1990) was an American physicist, {{who made}} major {{contributions}} to TV video camera tubes {{such as the}} orthicon, <b>image</b> <b>orthicon,</b> and vidicon.|$|E
5000|$|In 1950 {{the arrival}} of the Vidicon camera tube made smaller cameras possible. 1952 saw the first Walkie-Lookie [...] "portable cameras". <b>Image</b> <b>Orthicon</b> tubes were still used till {{the arrival of}} the Plumbicon.|$|E
50|$|The <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> tube was {{developed}} at RCA by Albert Rose, Paul K. Weimer, and Harold B. Law. It represented a considerable {{advance in the}} television field, and after further development work, RCA created original models between 1939 and 1940. The National Defense Research Committee entered into a contract with RCA where the NDRC paid for its further development. Upon RCA's development of the more sensitive <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> tube in 1943, RCA entered into a production contract with the U.S. Navy, the first tubes being delivered in January 1944. RCA began production of image orthicons for civilian use {{in the second quarter}} of 1946.|$|E
50|$|The <b>image</b> <b>orthicon,</b> (sometimes {{abbreviated}} IO) {{was common}} in American broadcasting from 1946 until 1968. A {{combination of the}} image dissector and the orthicon technologies, it replaced the iconoscope in the USA, which required {{a great deal of}} light to work adequately.|$|E
5000|$|... 1946 RCA's TK-10 studio camera used a 3" [...] IO - <b>Image</b> <b>Orthicon</b> Tube with a 4 lens turret. The RCA TK-30 (1946) {{was widely}} {{used as a}} Field Camera. A TK-30 is simply a TK-10 with a {{portable}} camera control unit.|$|E
50|$|The {{iconoscope}} {{was replaced}} in Europe around 1936 by {{the much more}} sensitive Super-Emitron and Superikonoskop, while in the United States the Iconoscope was the leading camera tube used for broadcasting from 1936 until 1946, when it {{was replaced by the}} <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> tube.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> camera {{can take}} {{television}} pictures by candlelight {{because of the}} more ordered light-sensitive area {{and the presence of}} an electron multiplier {{at the base of the}} tube, which operated as a high-efficiency amplifier. It also has a logarithmic light sensitivity curve similar to the human eye. However, it tends to flare in bright light, causing a dark halo to be seen around the object; this anomaly is referred to as [...] "blooming" [...] in the broadcast industry when <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> tubes were in operation. Image orthicons were used extensively in the early color television cameras, where the increased sensitivity of the tube was essential to overcome their very inefficient optical system of the other parts of the camera.|$|E
5000|$|The 1948 Dumont Marconi MK IV was an <b>Image</b> <b>Orthicon</b> Camera. Marconi's first {{camera was}} shown in 1938. EMI cameras from the UK, {{were used in the}} US in the early 1960s, like the EMI 203/4. Later in the 60s the EMI 2000 and EMI 2001.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the press}} {{releases}} on Electronovision were deliberately vague, perhaps {{to add more}} mystique to the process, it used conventional analog <b>Image</b> <b>Orthicon</b> video camera tube units, shooting in the B&W 819-line interlaced 25fps French video standard, using modified high-band quadruplex VTRs to record the signal.|$|E
50|$|An image {{splitter}} {{was used}} in the TK-40/41 to direct the incoming light into three <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> tubes (specially designed cathode ray tubes) for recording moving pictures in the red, green, and blue component colors. The early cameras required a very large amount of lighting, which caused television studios to become very warm due to the use of multi-kilowatt lamps (a problem that still exists somewhat today, but is less pronounced). The RCA TK-40 and TK-41 color cameras required more than an hour to set up and were comparatively unstable, making frequent adjustment necessary to maintain correct color balance between the red, green, and blue primary colors. These cameras also required complicated control consoles and rack-mounted power supplies for the camera's many vacuum tubes and ventilator fans cooling their large <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> tubes.|$|E
5000|$|This episode {{shows an}} {{unwanted}} {{effect of the}} <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> tube used in television cameras of the era. When the shiny fenders of the cars catch the light, the glint produces an unwanted dark halo around the glint. Such occurrences {{can also be seen}} in [...] "The Night of the Meek".|$|E
5000|$|The image {{dissector}} has no [...] "charge storage" [...] characteristic; {{the vast majority}} of electrons emitted by the photocathode are excluded by the scanning aperture, and thus wasted rather than being stored on a photo-sensitive target, as in the iconoscope or <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> (see below), which largely accounts for its low light sensitivity.|$|E
5000|$|... 1954 RCA's TK-11 studio camera used a 3" [...] IO - <b>Image</b> <b>Orthicon</b> Tube with a 4 lens turret. The RCA TK-31 (1954) {{was widely}} {{used as a}} Field Camera. A TK-31 is simply a TK-11 with a {{portable}} camera control unit. There is some commonality between the TK-11/TK-31 and the earlier TK-10/TK-30.|$|E
5000|$|The {{promoters}} of Electronovision {{gave the impression}} {{that this was a}} new system created from scratch, using a high-tech name (and avoiding the word kinescope) to distinguish the process from conventional film photography. Nonetheless the advances in tape-to-reel time were, at the time, a major step ahead. By capturing more than 800 lines of resolution at 25 frame/s, raw tape could be converted to film via kinescope recording with sufficient enhanced resolution to allow big-screen enlargement. The 1960s productions used RCA TK-60 <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> video cameras, which have a characteristic white [...] "glow" [...] around black objects (and a corresponding black glow around white objects), which was an inherent flaw of <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> video camera tubes called [...] "blooming." [...] Later vidicon and plumbicon tubes produced much cleaner, more accurate pictures, as well as a higher resolution of 1400 lines.|$|E
50|$|A vidicon tube is a {{video camera}} tube design in which the target {{material}} is a photoconductor. The Vidicon {{was developed in the}} 1950s at RCA by P. K. Weimer, S. V. Forgue and R. R. Goodrich as a simple alternative to the structurally and electrically complex <b>Image</b> <b>Orthicon.</b> While the initial photoconductor used was selenium, other targets-including silicon diode arrays-have been used.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days of colour {{television}} (from the mid 1950s to the early 1960s) studio cameras were heavy and hot-running because of the vacuum tube (thermionic valve) circuitry that they contained, in addition to three large <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> pick-up tubes.With these cameras there was always a tendency for the three coloured images to drift out of registration, over time, giving a consequential loss of picture sharpness.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, {{the site}} {{included}} 0.6 m and 0.4 m Cassegrain telescopes equipped with storage tubes, remote readouts and <b>image</b> <b>orthicon</b> electronic imaging tubes. The 0.6 m telescope had automated operation capability {{controlled by a}} computer. A 0.3 m Cassegrain was available for photometry, and the 0.152 m Chrysler Schmidt telescope was still available. By 1977, only the 0.6 m and 0.4 m telescopes were reported as operational.|$|E
