In each scene, segmented by scene-change detection schemes, a watermark is embedded temporally to one-dimensional projection vectors of the log-polar map, which is generated from the DFT of a two-dimensional feature matrix. Here, each column vector of the feature matrix represents each frame and consists of radial projections of the DFT of the frame. Inverse mapping from the one-dimensional watermarked vector to the feature matrix has a unique optimal solution, which can be derived by a constrained least-square approach. Through intensive computer simulations, it is shown that the proposed scheme provides robustness against transcoding, including frame-rate change, <b>frame</b> <b>averaging,</b> as well as interframe collusion attacks.|$|E

Davis ii Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive, high {{resolution}} morphological imaging modality which has gained significance {{since its inception}} in 1992 due to its diversified areas of tissue diagnostics in medical imaging.

30|$|Previous {{studies from}} {{electron}} microscopy {{have shown that}} both the precision of image features (image intensity/feature-height) [7], and the lateral spatial precision of features [25], improves proportionally to the square root {{of the number of}} <b>frames</b> <b>averaged.</b> Here, we evaluate the signal–noise ratio (SNR) of aligned images for an increasing number of frames with similar findings. In the extreme case where many hundreds of <b>frames</b> are <b>averaged,</b> the median-filter and subtraction method becomes less sensitive to image noise and becomes limited by the finite sampling of the image data. This does not indicate that the precision is no longer improving, but merely that the resolvability of features or noise has become limited by pixel-size instead of SNR. In practice, the data in Fig.  1 e shows that MFA of 30 images is sufficient for most applications because the rate of improvement diminishes significantly beyond this number.|$|R

40|$|When {{providing}} {{video for}} devices that support different frame rates, {{some kind of}} frame rate conversion has to be done. Simple methods such as frame repetition, <b>frame</b> <b>averaging</b> and frame dropping are commonly used to change the frame rate, but these methods introduce jerky motions or blurring artifacts. To avoid these artifacts, many algorithms {{have been developed to}} approximate new frames based on estimated movements between successive frames (motion compensation). This thesis summarizes a selection of previously proposed motion compensation techniques for frame rate up-conversion, and presents a prototype implementation that uses a subset of the described methods. The prototype lacks a number of features present in modern frame rate conversion tools, but objective evaluations show an improved result compared to frame repetition and <b>frame</b> <b>averaging.</b> Subjective evaluations show that even though the prototype performs well in many cases, the artifacts are more disturbing than those introduced by simple methods.

40|$|In {{the past}} 10 years astronomical image {{reconstruction}} {{based on a}} variety of speckle techniques have become popular means of enhancing and improving the resolution of turbulence degraded images. These techniques are based on the Fourier processing {{of a large number of}} turbulence degraded "snapshots" or frames of the irradiance in the system's image plane. The number of snapshots needed is largely a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the Fourier components of a single snapshot. Estimating these Fourier components is hampered by the inherent noise induced by the photon detection process and the random effect of the turbulent atmosphere. In most cases the SNR is much less than unity and many <b>frames</b> are <b>averaged</b> to improve the overall SNR.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of speckle reduction using traditional <b>frame</b> <b>averaging</b> technique was limited in ultrahigh speed {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT). As the motion between repeated frames was very small, the speckle pattern of the frames might be identical. This problem could be solved by averaging frames acquired at slightly different locations. The optimized scan range depended on the spot size of the laser beam, the smoothness of the boundary, and the homogeneity of the tissue. In this study we presented a method to average frames obtained within a narrow range along the slow-axis. A swept-source OCT with 100, 000 Hz axial scan rate was used to scan the retina in vivo. A series of narrow raster scans (0 - 50 micron along the slow axis) were evaluated. Each scan contained 20 image frames evenly distributed in the scan range. The imaging frame rate was 417 HZ. Only frames with high correlation after rigid registration were used in averaging. The result showed that the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) increased with the scan range. But the best edge reservation was obtained with 15 micron scan range. Thus, for ultrahigh speed OCT systems, averaging frames from a narrow band along the slow-axis could achieve better speckle reduction than traditional <b>frame</b> <b>averaging</b> techniques...|$|E
