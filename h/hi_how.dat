2500|$|Johnston's {{music is}} {{frequently}} cited for its [...] "pure and childlike soul". He gathered a local {{following in the}} 1980s by passing out tapes of his music while working at a McDonald's in Austin, Texas. His notoriety among underground circles was launched once Nirvana's Kurt Cobain began wearing a T-shirt that featured artwork from Johnston's 1983 album <b>Hi,</b> <b>How</b> Are You. In 2005, Johnston {{was the subject of}} the documentary The Devil and Daniel Johnston.|$|E

After the record store closed in 2003, the building remained unoccupied until 2004 when a Mexican grill franchise called Baja Fresh took ownership and decided to remove the wall that held the mural. A {{group of people who}} lived in the neighborhood convinced the managers and contractors to keep the mural intact. The building now houses a Thai restaurant called [...] "Thai, How Are You".|$|E
