40|$|Neuroblastoma is {{the most}} common extracranial tumor and a major cause of infant cancer {{mortality}} worldwide. Despite its importance, little is known about its molecular mechanisms. A striking feature of this tumor is its clinical heterogeneity. Possible outcomes range from aggressive <b>invasion</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>tissues,</b> causing patient death, to spontaneous disease regression or differentiation into benign ganglioneuromas. Several efforts have been made in order to find tumor progression markers. In this work, we have reconstructed the neuroblastoma regulatory network using an information-theoretic approach in order to find genes involved in tumor progression and that could be used as outcome predictors or as therapeutic targets. We have queried the reconstructed neuroblastoma regulatory network using an aggressive neuroblastoma metastasis gene signature in order to find its master regulators (MRs). MRs expression profiles were then investigated in other neuroblastoma datasets so as to detect possible clinical significance. Our analysis pointed MAX as one of the MRs of neuroblastoma progression. We have found that higher MAX expression correlated with favorable patient outcomes. We have also found that MAX expression and protein levels were increased during neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cells differentiation. We propose that MAX is involved in neuroblastoma progression, possibly increasing cell differentiation by means of regulating the availability of MYC:MAX heterodimers. This mechanism is consistent with the results found in our SH-SY 5 Y differentiation protocol, suggesting that MAX has a more central role in these cells differentiation than previously reported. Overexpression of MAX has been identified as anti-tumorigenic in other works, but, to our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that the link between the expression of this gene and malignancy was verified under physiological conditions...|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{metastasis}} involves multiple steps including {{detachment of}} the metastatic cells from neighboring cells, {{the acquisition of}} motility and <b>invasion</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>tissue.</b> All of these steps require the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In this study, {{we found that the}} protein palladin, a molecular scaffold with an important function in actin organization, is expressed at higher overall levels in tumors compared to benign breast tissue, and also significantly higher in four invasive breast cancer cell lines when compared to four non-invasive cell lines. In addition, we found that palladin {{plays a key role in}} the formation of podosomes. Podosomes are actin-rich structures that function in adhesion and matrix degradation and have been found in many invasive cell types. Our results show that phorbol ester treatment stimulated the formation of palladin-containing podosomes in invasive, but not in non-invasive cell lines. More importantly, palladin knockdown resulted in decreased podosome formation and a significant reduction in transwell migration and invasive motility. Palladin overexpression induced podosome formation in the non-invasive MCF 7 cells, which are otherwise unable to form podosomes, suggesting that palladin plays a critical role in the assembly of podosomes. Overall, these results indicate that palladin overexpression contributes to the invasive behavior of metastatic cells...|$|R
30|$|The first {{observation}} of EMT can be dated back to {{as early as}} 1890 when some ductal epithelial cells were described to acquire mesenchymal characteristics in breast tumors progression as reviewed previously (Nieto, 2011). It is suggested that EMT enables the tumor cells to acquire mesenchymal characteristics like loose cell-cell interaction and migratory ability, which further lead to the detachment of cells from tumor mass and the <b>invasion</b> of cells <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>tissues.</b> Although the requirement and significance of EMT for cancer progression has been debated for a long time, the migratory and invasive properties induced by EMT are widely accepted to be critical for metastasis (Peinado et al., 2007; Polyak and Weinberg, 2009).|$|R
