5|$|Promotions <b>in</b> <b>rank</b> were {{decided by}} the emperor and could occur on special occasions, such as {{installation}} of a new emperor, inauguration of a new reign title, the wedding of a new empress, or {{the selection of a}} royal heir apparent. The central government sometimes sold ranks to collect more revenues for the state. The official Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE) once wrote that anyone who presented a substantial amount of agricultural grain to the government would also be promoted <b>in</b> <b>rank.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{commanders of}} army corps, i.e. army groups {{composed}} of several regiments, {{were known as}} (in ascending order of rank): duces limitis, comites rei militaris, and magistri militum.

5|$|Although Blake {{was himself}} {{a member of}} the Spanish Regency, he was junior to Castaños in the {{military}} hierarchy (but senior to Ballasteros). He consequently did not protest when General Castaños agreed that Marshal Beresford, who was also junior to Castaños <b>in</b> <b>rank,</b> should command the combined Allied armies in any battle because there were more men in the Anglo-Portuguese force.|$|E

5|$|Born in the Canterbury Region of New Zealand, Kippenberger {{joined the}} New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in late 1915. He saw action in France on the Western Front, {{participating}} in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette. A serious wound in November 1916 saw him repatriated to New Zealand and discharged from the NZEF. He qualified as a solicitor in 1920 and worked in a legal practice in Rangiora. In 1924, he joined the Territorial Force and by 1936 had advanced <b>in</b> <b>rank</b> to lieutenant colonel.|$|E

5|$|Once a {{candidate}} {{was selected as}} an officer, promotion could be rapid. A. S. Smeltzer was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in 1915, after serving in the Regular Army for 15 years. He rose <b>in</b> <b>rank,</b> and by the Spring of 1917 had been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and was commanding officer of the 6th Battalion, The Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment).|$|E
5|$|Ray became Commander of the San Francisco Group of the Nineteenth Fleet in June 1946. On 10 July, {{like many}} other commodores, he was reduced <b>in</b> <b>rank</b> to captain again.

He died on 3 December 1970 at Beale Air Force Base Hospital in California.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the United States {{after the}} war, Olds was {{assigned}} at West Point {{as an assistant}} football coach for Red Blaik.

5|$|Starting {{his career}} in 1787 as a {{commissioned}} officer in the infantry, before seeing his first action in the Flanders Campaign, Wellesley rose <b>in</b> <b>rank</b> by purchasing his first four commissions, as was common practice in the British Army for wealthy officers.

5|$|The Han {{court upheld}} a {{socio-economic}} ranking system for commoners and nobles, {{which was based}} on the twenty-ranks system installed by the statesman Shang Yang (d. 338 BCE) of the State of Qin. All males above the age of 15 (excluding slaves) could be promoted <b>in</b> <b>rank</b> up to level eight. When a commoner was promoted <b>in</b> <b>rank,</b> he was granted a more honorable place in the seating arrangements of hamlet banquets, was given a greater portion of hunted game at the table, was punished less severely for certain crimes, and could become exempt from labor service obligations to the state. This system favored the elderly, since a longer lifespan meant more opportunities to become promoted. In addition to an increase in salary (see table to the right), newly promoted men were granted wine and ox-meat for a celebratory banquet. The 19th and 20th ranks were both marquess ranks, yet only a 20th rank allowed one to have a marquessate fief.|$|E

5|$|Walker {{became one}} of many {{officers}} holding wartime commissions to receive a commission in the Regular Army, into which he was commissioned as a first lieutenant on 1 July 1920, but was subsequently reduced <b>in</b> <b>rank</b> to second lieutenant on 15 December 1922, another common occurrence {{in the aftermath of}} World War I when the wartime army was demobilized. Already a command pilot, he also qualified as a combat observer in 1922. He was promoted to first lieutenant again on 24 July 1924.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of clashes with his {{superior}} at Inyokern, Captain James B. Sykes, Hayward left to become the Director for Plans and Operations for Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, Sandia National Laboratories on 1 August 1947. On 1 January 1948, he was reduced <b>in</b> <b>rank</b> to commander again. The Air Force offered a commission as a brigadier general, and Convair offered a job working on the SM-65 Atlas missile, but Hayward elected {{to stay in the}} navy. He participated in the Operation Sandstone nuclear tests in the Pacific in April 1948.|$|E
5|$|Also on 10 October 19, {{his wife}} Livilla {{had given birth}} to twin sons, Tiberius Gemellus and Germanicus, whom he named after his adoptive brother.

5|$|As a young officer, Rowell {{served at}} Gallipoli but was invalided back to Australia with typhoid fever in January 1916. The {{end of the}} war found Rowell junior <b>in</b> <b>rank</b> to his contemporaries with more {{distinguished}} war records, but he managed to catch up in the post-war period. Rowell spent five years with the British Army or at British staff colleges, establishing valuable contacts with his British counterparts. In 1939 he was appointed {{chief of staff of the}} 6th Division and later I Corps, serving in that capacity in the Battle of Greece and the Syria-Lebanon campaign. In 1942 he commanded I Corps in the Kokoda Track campaign but was sacked. His subsequent rise to become Chief of the General Staff demonstrated that the circumstances of his dismissal in 1942 were indeed extraordinary.|$|E
5|$|By 1787, he {{had risen}} <b>in</b> <b>rank</b> to Hauptmann (captain) in the Liccaner (Gospić) Grenz Infantry Regiment # 1. During the Austro-Turkish War (1787-1791), he fought with distinction, earning the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 15 November 1788. He {{was named to}} the nobility as a Freiherr in December 1788. In 1789 he raised a freikorps, which soon reached a {{strength}} of 3,000 men in 12 companies of infantry and 4 squadrons of hussars. During the Austro-Turkish War, Vukassovich served as freikorps' acting commander with the rank of Major, and was then promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel).|$|E
5|$|Cadets today {{live and}} work within the {{framework}} of the Cadet Leader Development System (CLDS), which specifies the roles that a cadet plays throughout their four years at the academy.

Freshmen have no leadership responsibilities, but have a host of duties to perform as they learn how to follow orders and operate in an environment of rigid rank structure, while seniors have significant leadership responsibilities and significantly more privileges that correspond to their rank.|$|E
