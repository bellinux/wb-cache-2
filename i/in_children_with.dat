40|$|Background/Aim. To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} abnormal Technetium Tc 99 m Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (Tc 99 m DMSA) renal scintigraphy findings <b>in</b> the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> urinary tract infection (UTI), and to evaluate {{the difference between the}} <b>children</b> <b>with</b> UTI and vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR), and the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> UTI without VUR. Methods. Tc 99 m DMSA renal scintigraphy was performed <b>in</b> 170 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> UTI, mean age 7. 07 years (1 month to 14 years, 137 were girls and 33 were boys). In 88 of the children, VUR was proved by micturating cystouretherography (MCU), while in 82 VUR could not be detected by MCU. VUR was graded in accordance with MCU recommended by the international study of VUR. In 13 of the children the grade of VUR was grade I, in 30 was grade II, in 23 grade III, in 17 grade IV, while the grade V was in 5 of the children. Findings of Tc 99 m DMSA renal scintigraphy were classified as: 1 - normal, 2 - probably normal, 3 - equivocal, 4 - probably abnormal, and 5 - abnormal. The degree of the significance of the difference of the findings was estimated using χ 2, taking p < 0. 01 as the limit of statistical significance. Results. Of the total number of 170 studied children, the abnormal findings were detected in 30 % (51 / 170), normal findings in 62 % (106 / 170), and equivocal in 8 % (13 / 170). <b>In</b> the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> UTI and VUR, the incidence of abnormal findings was 49 % (43 / 88), of normal 43 % (38 / 88), and of equivocal findings 8 % (7 / 88). All the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> VUR grade V had the abnormal findings (the incidence of the abnormal findings was 100 %). <b>In</b> the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> VUR grade IV, the abnormal findings were 71 %. <b>In</b> the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> VUR grade I, 77 % of the findings were normal, <b>in</b> the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> VUR grade II, 53 % of the findings were normal and <b>in</b> the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> VUR grade III, 30 % of the findings of renal scintigraphy were normal. <b>In</b> the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> UTI without VUR, the incidence of abnormal findings was 10 % (8 / 82), of normal findings 83 % (68 / 82), and of equivocal findings 7 % (6 / 82). The incidence of abnormal findings was significantly higher <b>in</b> the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> UTI and VUR than in those with UTI without VUR (p < 0. 01). Also, the incidence of the abnormal findings was higher <b>in</b> the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> VUR grades IV and V than <b>in</b> the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> VUR grade I (p < 0. 01). Conclusion. DMSA renal scintigraphy <b>in</b> the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ITU revealed the abnormal findings in 30 % of the cases. The incidence of the abnormal findings was significantly higher when VUR was present, as well as if the grade of VUR was higher. Our results confirmed that Tc 99 m DMSA renal scintigraphy was a very important technique in the evaluation of the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ITU...|$|R

5|$|About 1 in 1000 adults {{per year}} has DVT, {{but as of}} 2011, {{available}} data are dominated by North American and European populations. VTE is rare <b>in</b> <b>children,</b> <b>with</b> an incidence of about 1 in 100,000 a year. From childhood to old age, incidence increases {{by a factor of}} about 1000, with almost 1% of the elderly experiencing VTE yearly. During pregnancy and after childbirth, acute VTE occurs about once per 1000 deliveries. After surgery with preventative treatment, VTE develops in about 10 of 1000 people after total or partial knee replacement, and in about 5 of 1000 after total or partial hip replacement. About 300,000–600,000 Americans develop VTE each year, with about 60,000–100,000 deaths attributable to PE. In England, an estimated 25,000 a year die from hospital-related VTE. For unclear reasons, people of Asian descent have a lower VTE risk than whites.|$|E
5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. <b>In</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{ketogenic}} diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a first-line therapy <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> certain congenital metabolic {{diseases such as}} pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication. On the other hand, it is absolutely contraindicated {{in the treatment of}} other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, porphyria and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism. A person with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their body would consume its own protein stores for fuel, leading to ketoacidosis, and eventually coma and death.|$|E
5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> tuberous sclerosis). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E

5|$|OCD is a {{relatively}} rare disorder, with an estimated incidence of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 persons per year.

Although rare, OCD is noted as an important cause of joint pain in active adolescents. The juvenile form of the disease occurs <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> open growth plates, usually between the ages 5 and 15 years and occurs more commonly in males than females, with a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1.

5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is indicated}} as an adjunctive (additional) treatment <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> drug-resistant epilepsy. It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland, England and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. Children with a focal lesion (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) {{who would make}} suitable candidates for surgery {{are more likely to}} become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycaemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults. A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are tube-fed.|$|E
5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show {{less attention to}} social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E
