40|$|The {{allometric}} {{relationship between}} body mass and gonad mass in males of 23 fish species from 11 families was examined. There {{was no evidence}} of a single allometry <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>fishes.</b> A cross species analysis suggested a scaling coefficient of 104, which was significantly different from a previous study that reported a scaling coefficient of 0904. A within species analysis generated scaling coefficients from 068 to 390. Furthermore, for those species characterized by alternative mating tactics, there was no correlation between the scaling coefficients of bourgeois-type males and parasitic-type males. These results are discussed {{in the context of the}} gonado-somatic index and its use in testing sperm competition theory. # 2005 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles Key words: allometry; gonad; sperm competition; testes...|$|E
40|$|Dover sole were reared at 6 {{different}} stocking densities between 0. 56 and 12. 6 kg/m 2 with duplicate tanks {{for each}} treatment. The experiment lasted for 55 days. Water quality effects on growth were minimised {{by making the}} flow rate per tank proportional to the feeding load. Individual initial and final weights were determined <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>fishes</b> to calculate the specific growth rate and the coefficient of variation within each culture tank. The specific growth rate of Dover sole significantly decreased with increasing stocking density. Mortality increased significantly with increasing stocking density. The difference between initial and final CV (¿CV) increased with stocking density (P < 0. 06). A significant relation between stocking density and productivity was found. Productivity peaked at a stocking density of 7. 4 kg/m 2. The underlying mechanisms causing reduced average individual growth with increasing stocking densities are still poorly understood. Therefore, systematic behavioural studies focusing on the mechanisms causing depressed growth with increasing stocking density are recommended for future research...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} for enhancing fish abundance, species richness, and biomass on artificial reefs was examined by attaching floating attractants and manipulating structural complexity of small concrete reefs each approximately 1. 3 m in diameter, 1 m high. Experimental design {{consisted of a}} comparison of fish assemblages among three treatments (10 replicate, hemisphere-shaped reefs each) : 10 -m floating line attached (Streamer); concrete block in the central void space (Block); and no floating line or concrete block (Control). Reefs were deployed on sandy substrate at 20 -m depth off Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA. Divers recorded fish census data on slates 18 times over 24 months.

Size classes were used to calculate fish biomass. There {{was a significant difference}} among treatments. Block reefs had higher numbers of individuals, species, and biomass than Streamer or Control reefs (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). With one exception, Streamer reefs did not differ from Controls for any of the parameters investigated (p 3 ̆e 0. 05).

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the population dynamics of the fishes associated with a small (17. 5 hectares) temporarily open/closed estuary on the south east coast of South Africa. The results are based on the findings of an intensive sampling programme conducted over a period of four years in the East Kleinemonde estuary (33 ° 32 ' S : 27 ° 03 ' E). By adopting a quantitative approach, this study addresses the need for information on estuarine-associated fish population sizes, standing stock (biomass) estimates and productivity. The ichthyoplankton assemblage in the surf zone adjacent to the mouth of the estuary was dominated by postflexion larvae representing at least 21 taxa in 14 families. Rhabdosargus holubi of sizes ranging between 9 mm and 21 mm BL was the most abundant species with a mean density of 7. 3 individuals per 100 m'. This species, which accounted for 77. 6 % of the catch composition, was recorded throughout the year but revealed a distinct peak in abundance in spring (August - September). The ichthyofaunal community within the East Kleinemonde estuary was dominated by juvenile marine-spawning species and typical of a warm temperate southern African estuary. A total of 30 species in 17 families was recorded, including the endangered estuarine pipefish Syngnathus watermeyeri. Multivariate analyses (classification and ordination) of the catch assemblages revealed a high degree of similarity (> 70 %) throughout the estuary, with two distinct groups being identified on the basis of substratum type. The sampling stations near the mouth with a sandy substratum were distinguished from all other sampling sites in the estuary. The dominant estuarine-spawning species were represented by all life-history stages, suggesting that they bred successfully in the estuary. This group was numerically and gravimetrically dominated by the two zooplanktivorous shoaling species Gilchristella aestuaria and Atherina breviceps with density extrapolated population size estimates of 420 973 and 198 275 individuals, and biomass estimates of 1. 6 and 0. 6 g m⁻² respectively. The total population size of all estuarine-spawning species with a mean biomass 00. 4 g m⁻² was estimated at 754 217 individuals. Population size estimates of the marine-spawning species were calculated using data obtained from three independent mark-recapture experiments. The assumptions for the mark-recapture analyses were adequately met and it was concluded that the techniques provided reliable estimates of population size. However, estimates obtained from density extrapolation revealed enormous variability and were considered to be unreliable. The total population size was estimated at 63 342, 18 592 and 13 5 192 during the three mark-recapture experiments respectively. The numerically dominant species during all three experiments was Rhabdosargus holubi. Biomass production of the marine-spawning specIes was evaluated over a 123 day census period when population sizes and estimates of growth rates were known. Productivity <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>fishes</b> with a standing stock of 26. 2 g m⁻² was calculated at 4. 5 g m⁻² month 01 Rhabdosargus holubi accounted for more than 75 % of the total marine fish productivity. This study draws attention to the success of Rhabdosargus holubi in the East Kleinemonde estuary, which is ascribed to aspects of its biology. These include an extended breeding season, the ability to recruit into the estuary under adverse open mouth conditions and its omnivorous food habits. The dominance of this migratory species suggests that it plays an important role in the transfer of energy to the coastal marine environment when the mouth of the East Kleinemonde estuary opens. Predation by birds and a dominant piscivorous fish (Lichia amia) was quantitatively assessed over a period of two years. Monthly food consumption by all piscivorous birds revealed large temporal variability, ranging from 32 to 466 kg month-I An unusual invasion of Cape cormorants during the winter of 1994 accounted for large scale mortality (2246 kg of fish) over a relatively short period. The predatory impact of this episodic event was reflected in the findings of the fish mark-recapture experiments, which revealed a 70 % reduction in the total population of marine-spawning fishes (above a certain minimum size) in the estuary subsequent to this invasion. Monthly food consumption by the Lichia amia population in the estuary was calculated at 68 and 58 kg month-I for two distinct time periods when the population size was known. These findings suggest that this species is the top piscivorous predator in the East Kleinemonde estuary. Finally, the findings of this study highlight the temporal variability of fish populations within a single estuary. It is suggested that predation and estuary mouth conditions are the main factors influencing the abundance (and its variability) of individual species in the East Kleinemonde estuary...|$|E
