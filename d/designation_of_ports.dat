40|$|The Pew Environment Group has {{conducted}} a gap analysis comparing the port State measures (PSMs) established by 10 Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) with those {{established by the}} United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (PSMA, or Agreement). The research assessed {{the extent to which}} measures adopted by these RFMOs meet the PSMA standards, and identified those aspects that need to be further developed by each RFMO in order for its measures to become aligned with the Agreement's. The newly adopted PSMA sets an international minimum standard on PSMs and provides a unique opportunity to harmonise and strengthen port State controls globally. RFMOs have a special role to play in this process, specifically in helping to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing on the high seas. This report presents the final results of the gap analysis research conducted for the five tuna RFMOs based on information that was publicly available up to 30 April 2011. As part of our methodology, we shared the preliminary results of each RFMO gap analysis with the Secretariats of all 10 RFMOs and, through them, also with their Contracting Parties (CPs). We would like to thank those RFMO Secretariats and CPs that provided us with comments, many of which were extensive. We have taken all the comments received into consideration and revised our preliminary analyses where necessary. The analysis focused on a single set of tools available to combat IUU fishing, namely PSMs adopted by RFMOs, and did not examine other measures adopted by governments or any of the reviewed RFMOs, such as flag State controls or market measures not taken at port. Our assessment of the degree of conformity between each RFMO's PSMs and the PSMA does not reflect the overall performance of that RFMO in its efforts to combat IUU fishing. The aim of this exercise was to identify specific gaps in PSMs adopted by these RFMOs as they compare to the PSMA, and to make clear recommendations on how they could be strengthened. The goal of this research is to offer information that RFMOs could use to strengthen their own port State control systems and, as a result, contribute to enhanced harmonisation of PSMs across tuna fisheries around the world, with the aim of helping to further combat IUU fishing. With the exception of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), which has adopted a resolution that includes most of the substantive duties of the PSMA, overall the tuna RFMOs do not meet the new international minimum standard set by the PSMA. In particular, they do not have strong PSMs in place and the PSMs that they have adopted are quite fragmented. Our analysis shows the following gaps: ? few requirements to share information between States and RFMOs; ? inadequate <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> for entry of foreign vessels; ? poor prior-to-entry information requirements for vessels approaching ports; ? insufficient restrictive measures for IUU fishing vessels, e. g. denial of port services, landing or transshiping; ? generally weak inspection systems; ? limited duties for flag States to cooperate with port State actions. We recognise that IUU fishing on the high seas is a common challenge for all RFMOs and that IUU fishing vessels are not limited to one ocean or RFMO Convention Area. Thus, the more that RFMOs apply a common standard on PSMs, the better able they will be to address this challenge. The comparative analyses undertaken here point to clear steps that RFMOs can take if they want to reach the new international standard provided by the PSMA, and thus make significant progress in combating IUU fishing...|$|E

500|$|When {{the state}} highway system was {{originally}} signed in 1919, M-51 was initially designated from Holland to Grand Rapids. The highway ran from Zeeland along a route that used Byron Road and 32nd Avenue {{to connect with}} Port Sheldon Street in Jenison before connecting with Chicago Drive. The highway's course was simplified by 1924 to use Chicago Drive between Zeeland and Jenison. When the US Highway System debuted in 1926, this original M-51 was renumbered {{as an extension of}} M-21, and the M-51 number was reused for the original M-27 in The Thumb. The highway ran from Port Huron to M-83 (now M-142) west of Harbor Beach. [...] The <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> M-51 from <b>Port</b> Huron to M-46 was removed in late 1961, and the remainder to M-142 was removed in 1965.|$|R

40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} 8 May [1999]. The {{boundaries of}} modern nation-states delimit the territory {{controlled by the}} state. The <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> places or <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> entry on the borders of modern nation-states allows the counting of movement in and out. Immigration and migration statistics, however flawed, reflect the state's desire to know who is entering and leaving its territorial jurisdiction. They are, therefore, {{part of the process}} whereby a state constructs knowledge about the people that inhabit its territory. Immigration statistics also indicate who the state is prepared to receive as new members of the nation, and on what terms. Accordingly, the collection and presentation of immigration statistics, and the categories used to classify and count, are deeply embedded in the national project and the construction of national identity. When collecting information on those who enter, the state chooses what it wants to know. Who and what it decides to count reflects what it sees as important information as well as its concerns and anxieties about itself and the nation. The way that the information is categorized, ordered and displayed provides further insights into the priorities and preferences of the state. Methods and categories of counting in South Africa, as well as the way these categories were ordered in immigration returns, changed over time. Change was particularly apparent at moments when the state was consolidating or seeking to reinvent its notions of national identity. Immigration statistics, therefore, also tell a story of changing constructions of national identity and the priorities and anxieties of the South African state...|$|R
