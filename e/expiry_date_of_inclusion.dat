40|$|This paper unveils the {{diversity}} in lock-in agreements of firms {{listed on the}} Nouveau Marche stock exchange in France. We give the main economic reasons why shareholders adopt lock-in agreements that are more stringent than legally required. We relate the abnormal returns and the abnormal volume at the <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> {{the different types of}} lock-in contracts to the degree of underpricing, venture-capitalist reputation and underwriter reputation. Abnormal returns and trading volume increase at the lock-in expiry; this is especially pronounced at the <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> insider lock-in contracts as insiders are legally required to be locked-in. We do not find significant abnormal returns at the expiries of VC contracts, even though trading volume increases at their lock-in expiry. There is also no evidence of a positive (negative) relation between abnormal returns (abnormal volume) and more stringent lock-in contracts. Lock-in contracts and the degree of underpricing are complementary signalling devices. ...|$|R
40|$|Maintaining {{the safety}} and quality of {{manufactured}} food is an important concern for producers, government and consumers in Bangladesh. The nutritional value of food gradually reduces over time, until it finally becomes unsafe to consume and may cause harm to health. Then again, consumers throw out {{a large amount of}} manufactured food after the <b>expiry</b> <b>date,</b> believing it is not safe to consume. Thus, proper labelling <b>of</b> manufacturing and <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> food on packet can protect both {{the safety and}} quality of food and save a large amount of food from being wasted. The legislators of Bangladesh do not prescribe any rules or regulations for food producers, which obliges manufacturers to use scientific methods for identifying <b>expiry</b> <b>dates.</b> Moreover, food producers, importers and suppliers use unspecific and confusing terms to indicate the manufacturing and <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> food. This study finds that the <b>date</b> labelling <b>of</b> manufactured food issue in Bangladesh is inadequately regulated, triggering confusion among consumers, manufacturers, sales staff and regulatory authorities. Regulatory loopholes in date labelling contribute to food waste and threaten public health. These issues warrant the enacting of a comprehensive law establishing an effective regulatory body to oversee <b>date</b> labelling <b>of</b> manufactured and processed food...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{automakers}} (such as Mercedes-Benz) {{call for}} the replacement of undeployed airbags after {{a certain period of}} time to ensure their reliability in an accident.

Some Škoda vehicles indicate an <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> 14 years from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> manufacture. In this case, replacement would be uneconomic as the car would have negligible value at 14 years old, far less than the cost of fitting new airbags.
