She received a small pension from Israel and Germany. Uniformed Argentinean police were posted 24 {{hours a day to}} protect her from anti-Semitic and extremist groups. Here she formed bonds with many of the soldiers.|$|E

He was so ill {{that his}} relatives kept watch on {{him at all}} times, including a young cousin named Emma Pontier and {{a young woman who}} stayed with them by the name of Anna Brun. Marie treated him with various medicaments, especially gum arabic, which, according to her, always did her good, and which she always kept a ready supply of <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>small</b> malachite box, but to no avail. Charles deteriorated so rapidly that another physician, Dr. Massénat, was called in for consultation. He also diagnosed cholera and prescribed eggnog to strengthen him.|$|E

50|$|Forbes’ parakeets are {{medium-sized}} parakeets, {{with long}} tails and orange-red eyes. Plumage is bright green, {{with a red}} band across the forehead (but not reaching the eyes) and a yellow forecrown. The lores are also green, and the bird has some red plumage {{on the sides of}} the rump, and violet-blue outer primaries and wing coverts. The female parakeet is slightly smaller than the male, which is also reflected <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>smaller</b> bill size.|$|R
25|$|Of Queen Isabella’s five {{children}} to survive infancy, Paz {{was the one}} who resembled their mother most closely. Paz was short and plain with a small upward nose and a mischievous look <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>small</b> eyes. Unlike her sisters Isabel and Eulalia, Paz did not have a strong personality. She was uncomplicated, friendly and accommodating. Romantic and artistic, she was very fond of writing poems and was also a skillful painter. As a child, she studied the history of Spain, remaining interested in this subject. In later years she wrote articles published in the newspaper ABC. She was also musical; she played the harp, and enjoyed songs by Tosti as well as the operas of Verdi and Charles Gounod. She was also a devoted Catholic.|$|E
25|$|Maria Luisa's firm {{intention}} was to obliterate every trace of the government Elisa Bonaparte, who had ruled Lucca from 1805 to 1814 and who nominally succeeded Maria Luisa in Tuscany in 1808. As duchess, she promoted public works and culture {{in the spirit of}} enlightenment and during her government the sciences flourished. Between 1817-20, she ordered the complete renewal of the inner decorations of the Palazzo Ducale, completely redecorating the building into its present form, making the Palazzo one of the finest in Italy. Maria Luisa, a religious woman, favored the clergy. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>small</b> state, seventeen new convents were founded in the six years of her reign. Among the projects she accomplished were the building of a new aqueduct and the development of Viareggio, the port of the Duchy.|$|E

Two electric cranes were fitted aft and two derricks forward to handle her aircraft. Initially she carried two dismantled single-seat aircraft <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>small</b> forward hangar and five floatplanes in the hangar aft. Both aircraft in the forward hangar could be reassembled and flown off in about ten minutes. She was capable of operating up to seven aircraft, and during her career, operated a range of aircraft including the Sopwith Schneider, the Sopwith Pup and the Sopwith 1½ Strutter {{in addition to the}} aircraft mentioned.|$|E

500|$|Television {{critics have}} responded {{positively}} to the pairing. Robert Canning of IGN {{said of the}} episode [...] "Silly Love Songs": [...] "The absolute best part of [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] was Puckerman's unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes. Actress Ashley Fink has been fantastic <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>small</b> role, delivering great one-liners with ease. She was equally strong in this, the first episode to truly give Lauren a larger role and fill out her character more. Heck, {{it was nice to}} even see her smile a few times. The casting on Glee has either been very smart or very lucky since so many background characters have shined as they've been given bigger parts. The Lauren and Puck pairing came with a lot of laughs, but just as much heart. Puck singing Queen's [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls," [...] induced a chuckle at first, then some toe tapping. But it was Lauren's reaction that truly made the moment: 'That's the first song you've sung to me and it made me feel like crap.' I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented: [...] "For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self-professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that “bad” at all. But it’s always fun to watch Salling sing, and it’s always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings." [...] In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than before, but Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes [...] "as endearing as they are unrealistic", and E! Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that [...] "the ice around [...] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo." ...|$|E
2500|$|Drawing {{from her}} {{childhood}} {{experiences of the}} countryside, she wrote the pastoral novels [...] La Mare au Diable (1846), François le Champi (1847–1848), La Petite Fadette (1849), and Les Beaux Messieurs Bois-Doré (1857). A Winter in Majorca described the period that she and Chopin spent on that island from 1838 to 1839. Her other novels include Indiana (1832), Lélia (1833), Mauprat (1837), Le Compagnon du Tour de France (1840), Consuelo (1842–1843), and Le Meunier d'Angibault (1845). [...] Theatre pieces and autobiographical pieces include Histoire de ma vie (1855), Elle et Lui (1859, about her affair with Musset), Journal Intime (posthumously published in 1926), and Correspondence. Sand often performed her theatrical works <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>small</b> private theatre at the Nohant estate.|$|E
2500|$|Lind {{said there}} was no {{trepidation}} in taking on a gay role, and that she is [...] "really proud" [...] to portray Bianca. [...] "I am surprised that the gay community is still struggling and fighting so many years later," [...] she said. [...] "They are still fighting for basic human rights. I am excited {{to be a part of}} that fight." [...] Regarding most of Pine Valley being okay with Bianca being gay, Lind stated that she is [...] "a little curious" [...] to see some [...] "sort of real-life conflict arrive and see that some people <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>small</b> town do not accept her sexuality." [...] Lind clarified, [...] "In a sense, that is pretty relevant and controversial and true. Because Pine Valley is the exception, it’s a beautiful utopia right now. I wouldn’t mind attacking those issues that are happening in small towns right now." ...|$|E

Though very antagonistic against May <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>smaller</b> form <b>in</b> earlier episodes, he falls in love when she is enlarged to human size.

2500|$|... "Dmitry {{received}} Yusupov's suggestion with alacrity, and alliance {{was welcomed}} as {{indicating that the}} murder {{would not be a}} demonstration against the dynasty." [...] They had planned to burn Rasputin's possessions and call from the train station a popular restaurant to ask if Rasputin was in. Sukhotin put on Rasputin’s fur coat, his rubber boots and gloves. He left together with Dmitri and Lazovert into Purishkevich's car, suggesting Rasputin had left the palace alive. Because Purishkevich's wife refused to burn the fur coat and the boots <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>small</b> fireplace in Purishkevich's ambulance train, the conspirators went back to the palace with the mentioned items. When the body was wrapped in a curtain, the conspirators drove toward Krestovsky Island and, at about 5 a.m., threw the corpse from a bridge into the Malaya Nevka River into an ice hole. They forgot to attach weights so that the body would sink deep, dropped his fur coat over the railing with the chains, and drove back, without noticing one of Rasputin's goloshes, a rubber boot (size 10), was stuck between the piles of the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1946, Krasner {{began working}} on her Little Image series. She created around forty {{of these types of}} {{paintings}} until 1949. They are commonly categorized as mosaic, webbed, or hieroglyphs depending on the style of the image. The mosaic images were created through the thick buildup of paint while her webbed paintings were made through a drip technique in which the paintbrush was always close {{to the surface of the}} canvas. Since she used a drip technique in creating her webbed images, many critics believed upon seeing this work for the first time that she reinterpreted Pollock's chaotic paint splatters. Her hieroglyph paintings are gridded and look like an unreadable, personal script of Krasner's creation. These works demonstrate her anti-figurative concerns, allover approach to the canvas, gestural brushwork, and disregard of naturalistic color. They have little variation of color but are very rich in texture due to the buildup of impasto and also suggest space continuing beyond the canvas. [...] These were her first successful images she created while working from her own imagination rather than a model. The relatively small scale of the images can be attributed to the fact she painted them on an easel <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>small</b> studio space in an upstairs bedroom at The Springs.|$|E

5000|$|She was christened Carmen but called Mandy by her family.

Kareha is of the god race and is Asa's friend and classmate who enjoys making sweets and taking on related part-time jobs. Whenever she sees something romantic or cute, she has a habit of saying [...] "Ma Ma Maa!" [...] and starts to daydream, losing awareness of her surroundings.|$|R

60|$|She came {{straight}} {{back to him}} and took both his wrists <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>small</b> hands. She was taller than he, and his head was slightly bent forward. Thus she towered over him, loving but strong, her great, earnest eyes searching his soul.|$|E

50|$|The Loafers plinths {{reference}} important ceramic artist Lucie Rie. Rie pioneered domestic-ware <b>in</b> Britain, and <b>her</b> <b>small</b> {{works were}} {{developed at the}} same time as huge outdoor bronzes and in my mind, share a sort of 1950’s aesthetic.|$|R
