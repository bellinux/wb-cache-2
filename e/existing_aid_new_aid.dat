40|$|This paper designs a new equalization‐aid formula {{based on}} fiscal gaps of local communities. Using {{conceptual}} analysis and simulations with Massachusetts data, the authors illustrate the tradeoffs that policymakers face in deciding {{on the policy}} variables in the formula and lay out several general guidelines for setting up these variables. When states are in transition to a <b>new</b> local <b>aid</b> formula, {{the issue of whether}} and how to hold <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> harmless poses a challenge. The authors show that previous studies and the formulas derived from them give differential weights to <b>existing</b> and <b>new</b> <b>aid</b> in filling the gap and hence effectively treat communities receiving greater amounts of <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> more favorably than communities receiving less or no <b>existing</b> <b>aid.</b> As a fairer alternative, the authors propose a new approach that considers <b>existing</b> and <b>new</b> <b>aid</b> within a consistent framework by taking account of both in filling the gap. In addition, unlike previous research that focuses only on a single year’s <b>new</b> <b>aid</b> distribution, the authors simulate the dynamics of aid distributions over multiple years and examine their evolution over time. The authors further provide and compare several possible solutions to addressing the possible tradeoffs between short‐term and long‐term goals. Although the proposed aid formula is designed for municipal aid and tailored to Massachusetts, the authors note that foundation aid formulas for education implicitly treat <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> in the same way and suggest that the framework, principles, and policy recommendations might also be applicable to other states designing <b>new</b> municipal <b>aid</b> formulas...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} about the World Bank and the {{political}} dimensions of the <b>new</b> <b>aid</b> architecture. The <b>new</b> <b>aid</b> agenda, which emerged out of the post-Washington Consensus (PWC), has led to debates over its real significance. While Joseph Stiglitz {{has argued that the}} new consensus actually marked the end of the era of market fundamentalism, sceptics have rather concluded that it represents nothing more than a discursive shift. The Bank’s own ambiguous narrative on the <b>new</b> <b>aid</b> framework may explain such divergent analysis on the new agenda: On the one hand, the poverty reduction and participatory narrative linked to the model have appeared to be signalling a genuine shift towards a more social policy agenda. On the other hand however, there has been a contradictory move towards a stricter governance model that seems to be specifically designed to insulate policy-makers from vested interests. The overarching objective of this thesis is to shed new light on this apparent paradox inherent in international aid reform. It seeks to untangle the existing confusion between narrative, assumptions and methods entwined with the so-called PWC. Specifically, the crux of this thesis is to address the particular contribution of the World Bank in forging, promoting and implementing the PWC. It focuses both on the theoretical sources that triggered the World Bank, under the leadership of James D. Wolfensohn, to adopt a new model and on the political objectives of this agenda. Within such a research focus, the Bank’s narrative and its <b>new</b> <b>aid</b> allocation mechanisms are seen as one entity under the label ‘Integrated Development Model’ (IDM). The IDM – as a main object of study – allows us to transcend common country-based analyses of the Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRS) experience and to re-position the <b>new</b> <b>aid</b> allocation mechanisms within the larger reordering of power on behalf of market-oriented interests...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in the debate on aid effectiveness for assessing the impact of aid not only on economic growth and poverty reduction, but also on intermediate outcomes such as health and education. This paper reviews evidence from recent in-depth country work {{on the impact of}} government policies and service provision in health and basic education in Zambia, and examines to what extent <b>new</b> <b>aid</b> approaches have contributed to the observed outcomes. It finds that limited coordination and lax adherence to good aid principles undermine the effectiveness of these approaches. The discussion of the findings sheds light on the underlying political economy and incentive structures {{on both sides of the}} aid relation that lead to casual adherence to the principles for more effective <b>aid</b> in these <b>new</b> <b>aid</b> approaches. It argues that most of the observed coordination failures can be explained by collective action problems on the part of both donors and recipients. If the international aid effectiveness agenda is to move forward, it will have to devise adequate mechanisms to address these coordination disincentives...|$|R

40|$|Are recent donor {{approaches}} {{compatible with}} a political understanding of policy processes in partner or recipient countries? This question is given increased urgency with the recent calls for and commitment to increasing financial flows, scaling-up of aid, and promoting donor coordination. Do these commitments sharpen the potential dilemma between increased aid and the political processes, and the changes that inevitably accompany this? This paper discusses {{the nature of the}} partnership enshrined in the Monterrey consensus, budget support and poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSP) approaches, and assistance directly targeted to the poor, as one way of increasing aid flows to poorest countries. It also discusses approaches to the role of aid in economic growth, and argues for better understanding of the politics of growth. The papers questions whether the current ?institutions? or governance paradigm brings sufficient political context to aid delivery, and discusses the relationship between domestic revenue generation and foreign aid.

40|$|Abstract The Paris Declaration on aid {{effectiveness}} {{stipulates that}} broadly owned and results oriented national {{plans will be}} the basis for establishing national ownership and leadership of the aid process and for improving alignment and harmonization. In this sense, there is a close link between the Poverty Reduction Strategy approach and the Paris Agenda, both of which form part of the <b>new</b> <b>aid</b> paradigm that started around the year 2000. This paper assesses the actual progress in the implementation of the <b>new</b> <b>aid</b> paradigm in three Latin American countries: Bolivia, Honduras and Nicaragua. The results are disappointing. Frequent government changes and the composition of the donor group in the countries are partially responsible for the disappointing results, but the main conclusion is that the <b>new</b> <b>aid</b> paradigm is based on unrealistic expectations about the role that national poverty reduction or development plans can play in promoting the principles of the Paris Agenda...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the distribution of}} unrestricted municipal aid in Massachusetts, {{which has been a}} major concern to civic leaders and elected officials of many communities, including Springfield. The paper develops a measure of the municipal fiscal gap indicating the relative need of municipalities for state aid. The analysis shows that in recent years, unrestricted municipal aid has not been distributed in proportion to the gap measure among the 10 largest cities in Massachusetts. For example, despite having the largest municipal gap, Springfield received almost the lowest per capita amount of Additional Assistance [...] a key component of municipal aid. This pattern is the result of deep and uneven aid cuts in the past that distorted the distribution of municipal aid. This paper therefore suggests that state government consider adopting a formula that provides more aid to communities facing larger municipal gaps. To avoid disrupting local budgets, the state could consider holding <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> harmless, and using the gap-based formula to distribute <b>new</b> <b>aid.</b> The simulations show that if the state commits to reasonably large increases in municipal <b>aid,</b> this <b>new</b> approach can be both equalizing and beneficial to a majority of municipalities in the Commonwealth within a relatively short time period. The paper provides various formula evaluations and policy recommendations that could support efforts to reform state aid in Massachusetts. Municipal finance - Massachusetts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{principal}} malaria vector in Africa, Anopheles gambiae, {{contains two}} pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. The Y chromosome is only associated with males and other Y chromosome–specific DNA sequences, which are transferred to women during mating. A reliable tool to determine the mating status of dried wild An. gambiae females is currently lacking. DNA was extracted from dried virgin and mated females and used to test whether Y chromosome–specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers can be successfully amplified and used {{as a predictor of}} mating. Here we report a new PCR-based method to determine the mating status among successfully inseminated and virgin wild An. gambiae females, using three male-specific primers. This dissection-free method has the potential to facilitate studies of both population demographics and gene flow from dried mosquito samples routinely collected in epidemiologic monitoring and <b>aid</b> <b>existing</b> and <b>new</b> malaria-vector control approaches...|$|R
