500|$|Although {{the sheet}} music, {{published}} on Musicnotes.com by BMG Music, shows [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{in the key}} of F minor, the recording suggests it is approximately in F♯ minor, perhaps due to a speed discrepancy. The song has a moderate fast tempo of 132 beats per minute. Aguilera's vocal range on the track spans from A♭3 to F♯5. Dorian Lyskey of The Guardian noted that the beats of the song are [...] "brassy" [...] and have the same [...] "aerobic oomph" [...] as Beyoncé's [...] "Crazy in Love", while Jody Rosen from Entertainment Weekly deemed the track [...] "exhilarating". According to Aguilera; lyrically, [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] is not a love song, but actually intertwines with the events that she experienced in real life. The song seems to be about Aguilera's husband, Jordan Bratman, but is really simply about <b>feeling</b> <b>good.</b> During an interview with MTV News, Aguilera said of the song, [...] "I {{wanted to make it}} light and easy for people to dance to and sing along to... Lyrically, I just got married, so it's about someone in particular, but it's all about <b>feeling</b> <b>good</b> and not taking anything too seriously".|$|E

[...] M. Giant from Television Without Pity graded the episode with an [...] "A-".

In an attempt to get Oxbow past what had been described as his [...] "one-dimensional" [...] front-running style, Lukas turned to a training regimen at Saratoga where the horse had no clocked workouts, but instead was conditioned by jogging and galloping clockwise (the [...] "wrong way") on the training track for long one-and-a-half to two-mile trips each time out.|$|E

500|$|Heather Phares of AllMusic {{felt that}} the record was [...] "not simply Debut redux", concluding: [...] "The work of a {{constantly}} changing artist, Post proves that as Björk moves toward more ambitious, complex music, she always surpasses herself". Writing for MTV Online, Lou Stathis wrote that, [...] " [...] Björk's wacky, mind-altered perspective that makes Post modern pop music at once both baffling and engaging". He believed that the album was a rewarding experience for both the casual consumer, {{as well as the}} serious listener, also pointing out that, [...] "it not only sounds good while you're listening to it, but it leaves you <b>feeling</b> <b>good</b> when it's over, too". Robert Christgau, reviewing the album for The Village Voice, was less enthusiastic. He {{felt that the}} singer [...] " [...] primeval suspicion of Europeans who presume to [...] "improve" [...] on rock and roll," [...] criticizing her [...] "self-involved vocal devices" [...] and poor grasp of the English language. He gave Post a C+ rating, meaning he considered it [...] "a not disreputable performance, most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork." [...] MusicHound awarded the album two out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|The track {{has drawn}} {{comparisons}} to {{the style of}} 808s & Heartbreak, a studio album by rapper Kanye West noted for its jarring use of auto-tune. West has often been noted as an influence by Ocean. Ology writer Terron R. Moore mused that unlike West, Ocean was [...] "an inherently sad guy" [...] and that feeling of inner loss and hopelessness appears on every track on the album, even when he's supposed to be singing about the [...] "Sweet Life". He noted a hidden sense of despair on the song, not immediately apparent on first listen. The song also contains parallels to Ocean's own musical career, where Ocean recognizes that an album is much like a relationship: [...] "the main track, the single, often {{is not the best}} choice." [...] While singles are generally regarded as an album's best song, Ocean remarks that sometimes the most obvious decision holds more subtly. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard mused that Ocean took on the role of a [...] "captain" [...] on the track, prodding the privileged to reach for more by unraveling their lavish realities; [...] "Why see the world, when you got the beach?" [...] he asks rhetorically. Robert Everett-Green of The Globe and Mail stated that the track depicts dislocated lives of easy pleasure, of [...] "keepin’ it surreal" [...] with pills and sunshine, in music that’s supposedly all about <b>feeling</b> <b>good.</b>|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} for [...] "Oh Father" [...] was generally positive. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , commented {{that with the}} track, Madonna exposed herself by transforming her personal experience into art, making it clear to anyone how she felt about her relationship with Tony. Rooksby believed that the [...] "psychobabble" [...] phrases of <b>feeling</b> <b>good</b> about oneself in the song, {{would have made it}} extremely popular in the early Eighties. He added that [...] "Oh Father" [...] was the most compassionate and generous moment in Madonna's musical career and the track might have inspired the exploration of childhood in the music of contemporary artists like Kate Bush and Tori Amos, in particular Bush's song [...] "The Fog" [...] from her 1989 studio album, The Sensual World, and Amos' [...] "Winter" [...] from the 1992 effort, Little Earthquakes. [...] Author Leslie C. Dunn wrote in her book Embodied Voices, that the autobiographical nature of the song brought forth a new side of Madonna. Sharing the same view, Freya Jarman-Ivens, {{one of the authors of}} Madonna's Drowned Worlds, declared [...] "Oh Father" [...] as a powerful statement regarding father-daughter relationships. Allen Metz, author of The Madonna Companion, described the song as a [...] "stark ballad with a serious string arrangement". O'Brien felt that the strings were dramatic and pretentious. She described Madonna's singing as consisting of [...] "Courtney Love-style rasp" [...] and adding that Madonna [...] "attacks the song with personal passion".|$|E
500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not <b>feeling</b> <b>good</b> about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{controversial}} period of her career, Madonna said, [...] "I feel I've been misunderstood. I {{tried to make}} a statement about <b>feeling</b> <b>good</b> about yourself and exploring your sexuality, but people took it to mean that everyone should go out and have sex with everyone, and that I {{was going to be the}} leader of that. So I decided to leave it alone because that's what everyone ended up concentrating on. Sex is such a taboo subject and it's such a distraction that I'd rather not even offer it up." [...] During 1994, Madonna started recording her sixth studio album. She collaborated with R producers such as Dallas Austin, Dave [...] "Jam" [...] Hall, and Babyface, and also enlisting British producer Nellee Hooper to the project. It became one of the very few occasions where she collaborated with well-known producers, the first since Nile Rodgers on Like a Virgin (1984). When asked about the record, Madonna said she wanted people to concentrate on the musical aspects of it, and would like the songs to speak for themselves. She also commented that it was because she was not interested in giving many interviews and being on the cover of magazines. She described the album as [...] "a combination of pop, R, hip-hop and a Madonna record. It's very, very romantic". In an interview with The Face magazine, Madonna explained her inspirations behind Bedtime Stories as well as the reason for teaming up with R song producers.|$|E

2500|$|With {{regard to}} the {{condition}} of healthy narcissism, {{it is suggested that}} this is correlated with good psychological health. Self-esteem works as a mediator between narcissism and psychological health. [...] Therefore, because of their elevated self-esteem, deriving from self-perceptions of competence and likability, high narcissists are relatively free of worry and gloom. Other researchers suggested that healthy narcissism cannot be seen as 'good' or 'bad'; however, it depends on the contexts and outcomes being measured. In certain social contexts such as initiating social relationships, and with certain outcome variables, such as <b>feeling</b> <b>good</b> about oneself, healthy narcissism can be helpful. In other contexts, such as maintaining long-term relationships and with other outcome variables, such as accurate self-knowledge, healthy narcissism can be unhelpful.|$|E
