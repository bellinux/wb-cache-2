5|$|Doc Holliday had a {{reputation}} as a gunman and had reportedly been in nine shootouts during his life, although it has only been verified that he killed three men. One well-documented episode occurred on July 19, 1879, when Holliday and his business partner, former <b>deputy</b> <b>marshal</b> John Joshua Webb, were seated in their saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. Former U.S. Army scout Mike Gordon got into a loud argument with one of the saloon girls that he wanted to take with him. Gordon stormed from the saloon and began firing his revolver into the building. Before Gordon could get off his second shot, Holliday killed him. Holliday was tried for the murder but acquitted, mostly based on the testimony of Webb.|$|E

On route, Kimberly has a premonition of logs falling off a semi, causing a massive car accident that kills everyone involved. She stalls her car on the entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway, including lottery winner Evan Lewis; widow Nora Carpenter and her fifteen-year-old son Tim; businesswoman Kat Jennings; stoner Rory Peters; pregnant Isabella Hudson; high school teacher Eugene Dix; and <b>Deputy</b> <b>Marshal</b> Thomas Burke. While Thomas questions Kimberly, the pileup occurs. Shaina, Dano and Frankie are killed by a speeding truck, but Kimberly is saved by Thomas.|$|E

25|$|Goodfellow treated {{a number}} of notorious outlaw cowboys in Tombstone, Arizona during the 1880s.

Brocius took offense and even though Wallace apologized, Brocius threatened to kill him. When Wallace left, Curly Bill followed him and Wallace shot him though the cheek and neck. Goodfellow treated Brocious, who recovered after several weeks. Marshal Breakenridge arrested Wallace but the court ruled he acted in self-defense.|$|E
25|$|White {{was carried}} {{to a doctor}} and they {{initially}} thought he would recover, and the next day, he gave a statement that exonerated Curly Bill of murder, but that night, White's condition worsened.

He testified at his trial {{that he did not}} consider himself to have committed a crime. Brocius waived his right to a preliminary hearing, apparently because he feared a lynching, as White was very popular as town marshal. Brocius was anxious to be moved out of town. Pima County <b>Deputy</b> <b>Marshal</b> Earp and George Collins immediately took Brocius to Tucson for trial.|$|E

25|$|Under the Constitution of 1869, a Reconstruction {{document}} that centralized many governmental functions, no constables were elected in Texas from 1869 to 1872, though some were appointed by justices of the peace. Many of these appointees lacked experience in handling violent offenders {{and access to}} secure jail facilities, and had few deputies to call upon for assistance. They were {{no match for the}} poor, embittered, and heavily armed former soldiers from both sides who roamed the state, often turning to crime. As a result, the office of constable began to diminish in importance, and the better-equipped county sheriffs began to assume a leading role in law enforcement. Still, a number of prominent Texas peace officers of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries began their careers as constables or deputy constables, including Thomas R. Hickman, George A. Scarborough, and Jess Sweeten. In 1896, while serving as a United States <b>deputy</b> <b>marshal,</b> Scarborough shot and killed the controversial El Paso constable John Selman, who had himself gunned down the notorious John Wesley Hardin in 1895.|$|E
500|$|The Admiralty {{division}} {{housed a}} few prisoners under naval courts-martial for mutiny, desertion, piracy, {{and what the}} <b>deputy</b> <b>marshal</b> in 1815 preferred to call [...] "unnatural crimes".

The cells were so rotten they were barely able to confine the prisoners; in 1817 one actually broke through his cell walls. The low boundary wall meant that Admiralty prisoners were often chained to bolts fixed to the floor in the infirmary.|$|E

As an unpaid <b>deputy</b> <b>marshal</b> for Virgil, Wyatt habitually carried a pistol in his waistband, as was the custom of that time. Witnesses reported that Wyatt drew his revolver from his coat pocket and pistol whipped Tom McLaury with it twice, leaving him prostrate and bleeding on the street.

50|$|The {{need for}} law {{enforcement}} became critical in the late 19th century as gold was discovered in Alaska. Gold rush towns had crime rates per capita that dwarfed those of modern U.S. cities.

As a result, scores of <b>deputy</b> U.S. <b>Marshals</b> were deployed to Alaska.
