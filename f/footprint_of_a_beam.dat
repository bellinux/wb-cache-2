40|$|The International Muon Ionisation Cooling Experiment (MICE) is {{designed}} to demonstrate the effectiveness of ionisation cooling to reduce the phase space <b>footprint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> charged particle <b>beam,</b> principally to allow the subsequent acceleration of muons for next generation colliders and/or neutrino factories. The experiment (and indeed any subsequent accelerator cooling channel {{based on the same}} principles) poses certain unusual requirements on its RF system, whilst the precision measurement of the ionisation cooling process demands special diagnostics. This paper shall outline the key features of the RF system, including the low level RF control, the power amplifier chain, distribution network, cavities, tuners and couplers, many parts of which are required to operate in a high magnetic field environment. The RF diagnostics which, in conjunction with the other MICE diagnostics, shall allow detailed knowledge of the amplitude and phase of the acceleration field during the transit of each individual muon will also be discussed...|$|R

40|$|The water {{footprint}} concept {{has been developed}} {{in order to have}} <b>an</b> indicator <b>of</b> water use in relation to consumption of people. The water <b>footprint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> country is defined as the volume of water needed for the production of the goods and services consumed by the inhabitants of the country. Closely linked to the {{water footprint}} concept is the virtual water concept. Virtual water is defined as the volume of water required to produce a commodity or service. International trade of commodities implies flows of virtual water over large distances. The water <b>footprint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nation can be assessed by taking the use of domestic water resources, subtract the virtual water flow that leaves the country and add the virtual water flow that enters the country. The internal water <b>footprint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nation is the volume of water used from domestic water resources to produce the goods and services consumed by the inhabitants of the country. The external water <b>footprint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> country is the volume of water used in other countries to produce goods and services imported and consumed by the inhabitants of the country.

For example, the network <b>footprint</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> application that fetches execution logs from a server does not include the sizes of logs it would have fetched in a typical session, but would include control messages that it would have sent and received.|$|R
