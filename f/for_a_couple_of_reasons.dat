2500|$|The most {{important}} evidence for dating 1 Henry VI is the Diary of Philip Henslowe, which records {{a performance of}} a play by Lord Strange's Men called Harey Vj (i.e. Henry VI) on 3 March 1592 at the Rose Theatre in Southwark. Henslowe refers to the play as [...] "ne" [...] (which most critics take to mean [...] "new", although {{it could be an}} abbreviation for the Newington Butts theatre, which Henslow may have owned) and mentions that it had fifteen performances and earned Â£3.16s.8d, meaning it was extremely successful. Harey Vj is usually accepted as being 1 Henry VI <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> Firstly, it is unlikely to have been either 2 Henry VI or 3 Henry VI, as they were published in 1594 and 1595, respectively, with the titles under which they would have originally been performed, so as to ensure higher sales. As neither of them appear under the title Harey Vj, the play seen by Henslowe is unlikely to be either of them. Additionally, as Gary Taylor points out, Henslowe tended to identify sequels, but not first parts, to which he referred by the general title. As such, [...] "Harey Vj could not be a Part Two or Part Three but could easily be a Part One." [...] The only other option is that Harey Vj is a now lost play.|$|E

50|$|The Bijou was a {{distinct}} theatre <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> The Bijou {{was the first}} theatre in the United States to be elementarily lighted by electricity, which Thomas Edison personally installed and supervised. It also was unique {{for the fact that}} it did not have a traditional exit to the outside. Since it was on the second floor, the exits led to the lobbies of the two surrounding theatres, the B.F. Keith Theatre (later the Normandie and Laffmovie) and the newer Keith Memorial (later known as the Savoy and is now the Boston Opera House). After the tragic 1942 Cocoanut Grove fire (492 deaths), Boston heavily enforced new fire laws, and since the Bijou did not have adequate exits, it was forced to close.|$|E

50|$|Construction on the Iowa Turnpike {{would never}} begin. In January 1956, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 (H.R. 8836) was {{introduced}} in Congress. H.R. 8836 created the Interstate Highway System, a national system of controlled-access highways. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the bill into law on June 29, 1956. The new law was problematic for the Iowa Turnpike <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> Firstly, the law designated 700 mi of controlled-access highway in Iowa, including a cross-state route {{in the vicinity of}} the turnpike's planned route. Secondly, the federal government was going to pay for ninety percent of the construction costs; states were only required to match ten percent of costs (however, tolls were generally prohibited). The Interstate Highway System's completeness and financing rendered the Iowa Turnpike obsolete before it was ever constructed.|$|E

50|$|There are {{indications}} that eddies contribute to the preservation and survival of fish larvae transported by the Kuroshio. Plankton biomass fluctuates yearly and is typically highest in the eddy area of the Kuroshioâs edge. Warm-core rings are not known for having high productivity. However, the biology of the warm-core rings from the Kuroshio Current show results of productivity equally distributed throughout <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> One is upwelling at the periphery; {{the other is the}} convective mixing caused by the cooling of surface water as the ring moves north of the current. The thermostad is the deep mixed layer that has discrete boundaries and uniform temperature. Within this layer, nutrient-rich water is brought to the surface, which generates a burst of primary production. Given that the water in the core of a ring has a different temperature regime than the shelf waters, there are times when a warm-core ring is undergoing its spring bloom while the surrounding shelf waters are not.|$|E
