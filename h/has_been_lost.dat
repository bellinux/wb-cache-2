5|$|This careful {{treatment}} of the Haraldskær Woman's remains explains the excellent state of conservation of the corpse; conversely, Tollund Man, a later discovery, was not properly conserved {{and most of the}} body <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost,</b> leaving only the head as original remains in his display.|$|E
5|$|While {{much of the}} Loop's 19th-century {{architecture}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> to demolition and redevelopment, the Rookery {{has been}} spared this fate {{through a series of}} well executed renovations.

50|$|Later, his {{grandson}} King Ferdinand II of Aragon recovered the northern Catalan counties—Roussillon and Cerdagne—which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> to France {{as well as}} the kingdom of Navarre, which had recently joined the Crown of Aragon but <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> after internal dynastic disputes.|$|R

5|$|It is {{believed}} by historians that 168, 170 and 172 Denmark Hill {{were designed by}} noted architect and prison designer William Blackburn due their similarity in architectural style to his other buildings. However, as the original documentation relating {{to the construction of}} these houses <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> or destroyed, it has proved impossible to confirm this.|$|E
5|$|It is even {{possible}} {{that in any}} one generation no marbles of a particular colour are chosen, meaning they have no offspring. In this example, if no red marbles are selected, the jar representing the new generation contains only blue offspring. If this happens, the red allele <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> permanently in the population, while the remaining blue allele has become fixed: all future generations are entirely blue. In small populations, fixation can occur {{in just a few}} generations.|$|E
5|$|It {{is only as}} {{a result}} of {{accurately}} maintaining the composition of the 3 litres alveolar air that, with each breath, some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> by a short period of hyperventilation, breathing will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3kPa (40mmHg). The opposite occurs after breath-holding.|$|E

5|$|Much of Monteverdi's output, {{including}} many stage works, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost.</b> His surviving music includes nine books of madrigals, large-scale sacred {{works such as}} his Vespro della Beata Vergine (Vespers) of 1610, and three complete operas. His opera L'Orfeo (1607) is the earliest of the genre still widely performed; {{towards the end of}} his life he wrote works for the commercial theatre in Venice, including Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria and L'incoronazione di Poppea.|$|E
5|$|Possible ceratopsians {{from the}} Southern Hemisphere include the Australian Serendipaceratops, known from an ulna, and Notoceratops from Argentina is known {{from a single}} toothless jaw (which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost).</b> Craspedodon from the Late Cretaceous (Santonian) of Belgium {{may also be a}} ceratopsian, {{specifically}} a neoceratopsian closer to ceratopsoidea than protoceratopsidae. Possible leptoceratopsid remains have also been described from the early Campanian of Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Václav Jan Staněk {{proposed}} a variety capillisporum in 1958, {{which has been}} sunk back into synonymy with the species. M.coliforme is the sole species in Myriostoma, making the genus monotypic. Because the original type material <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost,</b> in 1989 Sunhede suggested that Dickson's illustration in his 1776 publication (tab. III: 4a & b) {{be used as the}} lectotype.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{test the}} hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before their extinction, adapiform {{primates}} {{were primarily}} found across North America, Asia, and Europe, {{with a few}} species in Africa. They flourished during the Eocene when those regions were more tropical in nature, and they disappeared when the climate became cooler and drier. Today, the lemuriforms are confined in the tropics, ranging between 28°S to 26°N latitude. Lorises are found both in equatorial Africa and Southeast Asia, while the galagos are limited to the forests and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. Lemurs are endemic to Madagascar, although much of their diversity and habitat <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> due to recent human activity.|$|E
5|$|Deforestation {{has also}} caused {{population}} declines for the vulnerable Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from {{several of the}} areas in which it was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> in the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E

5|$|In Ireland, {{various forms}} of English have been spoken since the Norman invasions of the 11th century. In County Wexford, in the area {{surrounding}} Dublin, two extinct dialects known as Forth and Bargy and Fingallian developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern Irish English, however {{has its roots in}} English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into Ulster English, the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots, as well as various dialects of the Republic of Ireland. Like Scottish and most North American accents, almost all Irish accents preserve the rhoticity which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> in the dialects influenced by RP.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, it is {{difficult}} to tell whether a trait <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been switched off and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an atavism. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (selectively neutral) has a steadily decreasing probability of retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} scene, the nurse confesses {{to the mother}} that the child <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost.</b> Rover, also sitting in the room, listens before jumping {{through the window and}} racing down the street, going around a corner and across a river. The dog makes its way to a slum and barges through each and every door; he finds the right one and enters. In an attic, the beggar woman is {{removing}} the clothing from the child; the dog enters and is driven off by the beggar.|$|E
