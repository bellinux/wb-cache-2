25|$|Adults {{are large}} flies, and unusual amongst brachyceran flies {{because they have}} a dense {{covering}} of fine setae (like hairs) and colored patterns that make them appear like bumble-bees (Hymenoptera). All species of the Oestridae are so highly adapted to the myiasis type of parasitism that the adults do not feed and have only residual mouthparts (see photograph of Hypoderma iparece). All these flies have an obligate myiasis life-cycle, with a complete metamorphosis. The females lay eggs with high selectivity on their special hosts and at specific sites there. For example, eggs laid on the legs of horses in the case of species of Gasterophilus. The horse licks at the irritated skin and the larvae transfer to the mouth of horse. The larvae penetrate tissues in the oral cavity, feed parasitically whilst migrating through tissue of the esophagus to finally reach the stomach. The final larval stage is completed with the larvae attached to the mucosa of the horse's stomach. When ready to pupate the larvae detach and are voided in the horse's feces. Another example is <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis,</b> torsalo-fly, which is an important parasite of cattle, and sometimes humans, in tropical regions of South America. The larvae cause a localized, furuncular (= like a boil) myiasis in the skin of their hosts. The larvae infest these sites when transported there accidentally by blood feeding mosquitoes; the adult female Dermatobia flies lay their eggs on the legs of mosquitoes, a dispersal mechanism called phoresy.|$|E

50|$|Botflies {{are known}} to parazitise humans or other mammalians thus causing myiasis and to use {{mosquitoes}} as intermediate vector agents to deposit eggs on a host. The human botfly <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis</b> attaches its eggs to the underside of a mosquito, and when the mosquito takes a blood meal from a human or an animal, the body heat of the mammalian host induces hatching of larvae.|$|E
50|$|The Oestridae are {{a family}} of flies {{variously}} known as bot flies, warble flies, heel flies, gadflies, and similar names. Their larvae are internal parasites of mammals, some species growing in the host's flesh and others within the gut.The human botfly, <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis,</b> is the only species of bot fly known to parasitize humans routinely, though other species of flies do cause myiasis in humans.|$|E
50|$|It is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} and control of internal parasitosis (gastrointestinal and pulmonary nematodes), ticks and mange (and other ectoparasites). Doramectin is a derivative of ivermectin. Its spectrum includes: Haemonchus, Ostertagia, Trichostrongylus, Cooperia, and Oesophagostomum species and Dictyocaulus viviparus, <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis,</b> Boophilus microplus, and Psoroptes bovis, among many other internal and external parasites. It is available as an injection and as a 5-mg/ml topical solution.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "bot" [...] in {{this sense}} means a maggot. A warble is a skin lump or callus such as might be caused by an ill-fitting harness, or by the {{presence}} of a warble fly maggot under the skin. The human botfly, <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis,</b> is the only species of bot flies whose larvae ordinarily parasitise humans, though flies in some other families episodically cause human myiasis, and are sometimes more harmful.|$|E
50|$|Ps. ferox {{carries a}} number of diseases, {{although}} it is not considered a major vector. It is known to carry Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE). It was found to be a minor vector of West Nile Virus (WNV) in New York. Several viruses have been found in this mosquito in the Amazon, such as Una virus and Ilheus virus. In Central and South America, the mosquito carries the larvae of <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis,</b> the human bot fly, a parasite whose larvae develop inside the flesh of a mammal host.|$|E
50|$|The human botfly, <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis</b> (Greek , skin + , life, and Latin , of a human), is one {{of several}} species of fly, the larvae of which {{parasitise}} humans (in addition {{to a wide range of}} other animals, including other primates). It is also known as the torsalo or American warble fly, even though the warble fly is in the genus Hypoderma and not Dermatobia, and is a parasite on cattle and deer instead of humans. An infestation of cattle is shown in the article Parasitic flies of domestic animals.|$|E
50|$|Botflies deposit eggs on a host, or {{sometimes}} use an intermediate vector {{such as the}} common housefly, mosquitoes, and, {{in the case of}} <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis,</b> a species of tick. They are common in Belize. The smaller fly is firmly held by the botfly female and rotated to a position where the botfly attaches some 30 eggs to the body under the wings. Larvae from these eggs, stimulated by the warmth and proximity of a large mammal host, drop onto its skin and burrow underneath. Intermediate vectors are often used since a number of animal hosts recognise the approach of a botfly and flee.|$|E
5000|$|In Paraguay {{people are}} afraid of the Black witch moth, as there is a mistaken belief about the moth urinating over their human [...] "victims" [...] and thereby inoculating their eggs, which then develop into maggots {{developing}} under the skin. Some also believe, if it touches your eyes, you can go blind. The maggots referred to are the myiasis-causing larvae of the human botfly (<b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis).</b> As a consequence of that belief, both the moth and the maggot are called with the common name [...] "Ura". Both the name and folk belief are of unknown origin.|$|E
50|$|When C. anthropophaga causes {{cutaneous}} myiasis, {{the larvae}} {{more often than}} not can be removed without any incision. Covering the punctum (the breathing hole) with petroleum jelly or similar substances cuts off the air supply and forces the maggot to the surface, where it is easy to capture with forceps. If this does not work, local anesthetic can be administered and an incision made to widen the punctum and remove the maggot. Another treatment discussed in the March 2014 Journal of the American Medical Association is to inject a combination of anaesthetic and epinephrine into the insect's chamber. Less drastically, because larvae of C. anthropophaga have smaller hooked bristles on the cuticle than those of <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis,</b> it often is practical just to push {{on each side of the}} hole to squeeze the maggot out, especially after first enlarging the punctum. It is important not to burst the larva to prevent the risk of granulomatous or serious inflammatory reaction.|$|E

40|$|Dois bovinos foram infectados com larvas de <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis</b> na região escapular esquerda, e o local de infecção de um dos bovinos foi inoculado com Mannheimia granulomatis. Aos sete, 14, 21 e 28 dias, foram feitas biópsias cirúrgicas dos locais de inoculação das larvas para {{posterior}} estudo histológico, imuno-histoquímico e avaliação por microscopia eletrônica de transmissão. No bovino infectado somente com as larvas, as lesões histológicas se caracterizaram por dermatite eosinofílica, infiltrado de células mononucleares e proliferação de tecido conjuntivo. A inoculação simultânea de <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis</b> e Mannheimia granulomatis provocou adicionalmente linfangite e microabscessos eosinofílicos, similares aos observados em casos espontâneos da enfermidade. Na amostra coletada aos 28 dias após a infecção bacteriana, foi observada, tanto na imuno-histoquímica, como por meio da microscopia eletrônica, a presença de corpos bacterianos aparentemente intactos no interior de fagossomas macrofágicos, sugerindo que a bactéria permanece dentro dos macrófagos até que algum fator desconhecido desencadeie o desenvolvimento da enfermidade. A Mannheimia granulomatis foi isolada de larvas coletadas aos 42 dias após a inoculação, demonstrando que a bactéria pode sobreviver por algum tempo na larva de <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis.</b> Os dados do trabalho indicam que as larvas de <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis</b> podem atuar como um fator contribuinte para o desenvolvimento da paniculite fibrogranulomatosa proliferativa. Two cattle {{were infected}} {{at the left}} scapula with larvae of the <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis,</b> while {{one of them was}} infected with the Mannheimia granulomatis. Biopsies of the lesions were taken at the 7, 14, 21 and 28 days p. i. for subsequent histopatological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopical studies. In the only animal infected with larvae, eosinophilic dermatitis, infiltration of mononuclear cells and proliferation of connective tissue characterized the histological lesions. The simultaneous inoculation of <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis</b> and Mannheimia granulomatis caused, besides the characteristic lesions of the parasitosis, linfangitis and eosinophilic microabscesses, similar changes to those observed in spontaneous cases of the disease. In the samples taken after 28 days of the bacterial infection it was observed, in both immunohistochemestry and by electronic microscopy the presence of apparently intact bacterial bodies inside macrophages fagosomes, suggesting that the bacteria is inside the macrophages until some unknown factors trigger the development of the illness. Mannheimia granulomatis was isolated from larvae gathered 42 days after inoculation demonstrating that the bacteria can survive inside the larva <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis.</b> Data from the study indicate that the larvae of <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis</b> may act as a contributing factor to the development of proliferative fibrogranulomatous panniculitis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Furuncular myiasis {{caused by}} <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis</b> is endemic {{throughout}} Central and South America. We report {{a case of}} furuncular myiasis in a traveler returned from Costa Rica. The case is unique because the primary care physician obtained magnetic resonance images. The images, however, do not show any characteristic features that assist in diagnosis. Myiasis is defined as infestation of a vertebrate host by fly larvae that feed on living tissue, body fluids, or ingested foods. Furuncular myiasis is caused by <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis,</b> the human botfly or Cordylobia anthropophaga, the African tumbu fly, which produce boil-like lesions commonly misdi-agnosed as a furuncle. 1 <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis</b> is endemic through much of Central and South America.

40|$|Myiasis (Gr. myia fly) is the {{infestation}} of tis-sues by fly larvae, or maggots. It {{is common}} in domestic and wild mammals worldwide and is a relatively frequent occurrence in humans in rural areas where people are {{in close contact with}} domestic animals. This report describes the appearance and struc-tures of a mature 3 rd stage larva of <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis</b> Linnaeus (Diptera: Cuterebridae), the human botfly, recovered from a patient in Tulsa, Oklahoma. <b>Dermatobia</b> <b>hominis</b> occurs in Mexico and Central and South America where its larvae parasitize a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans and domestic and wild mammals and a few birds (Catts 1982, Goddard 2003). Although the fly does not occur in the United States, the larvae have been recovered from Americans traveling in endemic areas. A mature 3 rd stage larva of D. hominis emerged from a boil-like ulcer on the scalp of an adult female, a resident of Tulsa, Okla-homa, approximately 9 wk after she had returned from a 2 wk vacation to Costa Rica. The living larva was observed and photo-graphed (Fig. 1) approximately 12 h after emergence; fixed in 70 % ethanol at 60 °C; cooled to room temperature and after 24 h, processed for scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 2). The live larva measured 15 mm long by 8 mm wide, tapering to a 3. 5 mm anterior end and a 1 mm posterior spiracle. The larva was creamy-white in appearance and possessed two anemone-like spiracles and a pair of well developed oral hooks on the anterior end (Fig. 1).
