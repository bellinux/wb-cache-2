5|$|An {{internal}} {{attempt was}} made to discredit Gomułka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to his advantage and he tolerated it until the societal damage wrecked by the Moczar movement had become irreversible. Gomułka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by Leonid Brezhnev, was preoccupied with the crisis in Czechoslovakia and not inclined to support personal changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Polish</b> leadership.|$|E
5|$|He was an {{educational}} activist, {{member of the}} Commission of National Education and the initiator and president of Society for Elementary Textbooks. He was an opponent of king Stanisław II August in the 1770s and 1780s, and a major figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Polish</b> politics of that era. During the Great Sejm he was {{a leader of the}} Patriotic Party and the reform movement and eventually backed the King in many reform projects. An advocate of a pro-Prussian orientation, he helped conclude an alliance with Prussia in 1790. He co-authored the Constitution of 3 May 1791.|$|E
5|$|In America he also {{continued}} writing fiction, in 1877 publishing Szkice węglem (Charcoal Sketches) <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Polish</b> Gazette.

5|$|In August 1919, the Sejm (lower {{house of}} parliament) of the renascent Republic of Poland adopted a law {{defining}} the Banner of the Republic of Poland (chorągiew Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej).

It was plain red emblazoned with the crowned White Eagle and bordered with a wężyk generalski, a wavy line used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Polish</b> military as a symbol of general's rank.

5|$|In {{response}} to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which only {{served as a}} pretext to worsen relations.

40|$|Purpose: As a {{continuation}} of a previous paper [1], the report demonstrates the various possibilities of float <b>polishing</b> utilizing <b>the</b> present improved magnetic compound fluid (MCF). The MCF developed by one of authors, Shimada, in 2001, was improved {{by the addition of}} α-cellulose, thereby achieving a clearance as great as 8 mm as shown in another paper [1]. The present paper describes the possibility of the application of <b>the</b> MCF float <b>polishing</b> technique with α-cellulose. Design/methodology/approach: First, the results obtained under various <b>polishing</b> conditions of <b>the</b> MCF float <b>polishing</b> technique are described. These conditions include the various shapes of <b>the</b> magnet employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> tool, magnetic field strength, the concentration of α-cellulose, the motion of the specimen, the existence of a magnet fixed underneath <b>the</b> <b>polished</b> specimen, and initial surface roughness. Secondly, the present MCF float polishing technique can be used in many types of <b>polishing,</b> including <b>polishing</b> <b>the</b> inner surface of an acrylic resin tube, a wide flat surface {{through the use of a}} orbital polishing tool, and simultaneous float polishing of all surfaces of a three-dimensional complex shape. In addition, as other examples, <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> on <b>the</b> integrated circuit (IC) substrate is shown. Findings: By <b>the</b> various <b>polishing</b> conditions of <b>the</b> MCF float <b>polishing</b> technique, <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> effect is changed. On the other hand, as for the many applications of <b>the</b> MCF float <b>polishing,</b> inner surface, wide flat surface, rough initial surface, three-dimensional complex shape and IC substrate can be <b>polished.</b> Research limitations/implications: <b>The</b> data under various <b>polishing</b> conditions of <b>the</b> MCF float <b>polishing</b> technique helps to clarify <b>the</b> present <b>polishing</b> technique’s possible practical applications. As shown in a previous paper [1], since MCF contains long magnetic clusters, <b>the</b> present <b>polishing</b> technique allows float polishing with large clearance. Therefore, many applications of <b>the</b> MCF float <b>polishing</b> are useful <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> fields. Practical implications: The present study indicates <b>the</b> practical application <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>polishing.</b> Originality/value: <b>The</b> present technique of MCF float <b>polishing</b> is new <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of float <b>polishing.</b> <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> ordinary float <b>polishing</b> technique having large clearance has not been proposed. Therefore, the present paper is very useful <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> field...|$|R

5|$|Soviet-oriented parties, {{backed by}} the Soviet Red Army and {{in control of the}} {{security}} forces, held most of the power, concentrated especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Polish</b> Workers' Party under Władysław Gomułka and Bolesław Bierut.

5|$|The Polish Second Army {{consisted}} of five infantry divisions: (5th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th, the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000–90,000 men, and 500 tanks. Many {{of them were}} new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories. The quality of the officer corps has also been questioned. One of the major problems facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers. Many of the officers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Polish</b> Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.|$|E
