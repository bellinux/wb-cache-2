40|$|Few {{problems}} are {{as complicated as}} <b>drug</b> misuse. <b>Drug</b> <b>addiction</b> is a major public health issue with implications for healthcare systems and society at large. As well as expenditure on prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, costs are also incurred by the welfare, social service and the criminal justice systems. In addition, there are further human costs associated with impaired health, damaged relationships and lowered productivity. This book is about treatment options. The history of <b>addiction</b> <b>treatment</b> has been characterised by fads and fashions. Some of the treatments used have been, at best ineffective, at worse harmful, and occasionally even dangerous. However, {{in the past two}} decades, many promising treatment interventions and procedures, and new therapeutic agents have been developed. Different forms of psychological treatments have been tested and provided in a systematic manner. There are a range of pharmacological options where once there were few. Most importantly, there is increasing evidence about the effectiveness of many of these treatments, and there is a clearer understanding {{of the importance of the}} social, environmental, behavioural and cognitive processes involved, as well as the use of active coping strategies during recovery. <b>Addiction</b> <b>treatment</b> involves a variety of different practices and procedures used with different populations and which are designed to achieve different goals. <b>Drug</b> <b>Addiction</b> and its <b>Treatment</b> explains why no single treatment is effective for everyone with a <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> problem. <b>Treatment</b> is provided by a range of personal from differing backgrounds and in a range of settings.

40|$|Cocaine use {{leads to}} health, social and legal problems. The {{aim of this}} paper is to discuss cocaine action, addicts characteristics, use {{patterns}} and consequences, as well as <b>addiction</b> <b>treatment</b> methods. A literature review was based on the Medline, PubMed, Polish Medical Bibliography databases and the Silesian Library resources. The Police and Central Statistical Office statistics, as well as the World Health Organization, the European Monitoring Centre for <b>Drugs</b> and <b>Drug</b> <b>Addiction</b> and the National Office for Combating <b>Drug</b> <b>Addiction</b> reports were used. Cocaine leads to mood improvement, appetite decrease, physical and intellectual activity enhancement, euphoria, inflated self-esteem, social networking ease and increased sexual desire. Cocaine hydrochloride is mainly used intranasaly, but also as intravenous and subcutaneous injections. Cocaine use and first <b>addiction</b> <b>treatment</b> fall in later age compared to other psychoactive substances. There is a high men to women ratio among addicts. There is a relationship between cocaine addiction, the presence of other disorders and genetic predisposition to addiction development. Polish reports indicate higher popularity of cocaine among people with a high economic and social status. Although Poland is a country with the low percentage of cocaine use, its popularity is growing. The consequences of cocaine use concern somatic and mental health problems, socioeconomic and legal conditions. The drug plays a role in crimes and traffic accidents. Because of the risks associated with cocaine use, it has been listed in a register of drugs attached to the Act on Counteracting <b>Drug</b> <b>Addiction.</b> <b>Addiction</b> <b>treatment</b> includes psychological, pharmacological and harm reduction strategies.

40|$|We {{assessed}} tobacco-related {{policies and}} procedures at all state-funded, community-based residential mental health and substance <b>addiction</b> <b>treatment</b> facilities before implementation of new state policy requirements. We conducted telephone interviews with 162 of 166 (98 %) facility administrators. Only 15 % had voluntarily implemented 100 % smokefree campus policies, and 47 % offered cessation resources at patient discharge; however, less than 10 % expressed opposition to these future requirements. Smoking bans and cessation support in residential treatment facilities can reduce tobacco-related disparities among {{people with mental illness}} and addictions, but states may need to be the catalyst for policy implementation. Objective Although the disproportionate tobacco use prevalence among people with mental illness and substance use disorders is well documented (1, 2), few policies exist in the United States that address this problem. In Oregon, 3 statewide policy changes are under way at community-based residential mental health and <b>addiction</b> <b>treatment</b> facilities: 1) requiring 100 % smoke-free campuses, 2) prohibiting staff from distributing tobacco products to residents, and 3) mandating integration of smoking cessation into discharge planning.
