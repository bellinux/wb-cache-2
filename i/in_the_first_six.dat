5|$|For {{persistent}} {{low back}} pain, the short-term outcome is also positive, with improvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> weeks but very little improvement after that. At one year, those with chronic {{low back pain}} usually continue to have moderate pain and disability. People at higher risk of long-term disability include those with poor coping skills or with fear of activity (2.5 {{times more likely to}} have poor outcomes at one year), those with a poor ability to cope with pain, functional impairments, poor general health, or a significant psychiatric or psychological component to the pain (Waddell's signs).|$|E

5|$|The {{risks and}} {{complications}} related to implant therapy divide into those that occur during surgery (such as excessive bleeding or nerve injury), those that occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> months (such as infection {{and failure to}} osseointegrate) and those that occur long-term (such as peri-implantitis and mechanical failures). In the presence of healthy tissues, a well-integrated implant with appropriate biomechanical loads can have 5-year plus survival rates from 93 to 98 percent and 10 to 15 year lifespans for the prosthetic teeth. Long-term studies show a 16- to 20-year success (implants surviving without complications or revisions) between 52% and 76%, with complications occurring up to 48% of the time.|$|E

5|$|This left Australia {{to chase}} 404 runs for victory. At the time, {{this would have}} been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating spinners' wicket. Morris and Hassett started slowly, with only six runs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> overs on a pitch that offered spin and bounce. Only 44 runs came in the first hour, leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes. Both players survived close calls before Hassett fell at 1/57.|$|E

The film was then released in Malaysia, where it made RM1.1 million, and Hong Kong, taking in HK$3.1 million.

5|$|A few teams {{expressed}} interest in St. Louis. He chose to sign with the Tampa Bay Lightning as he believed {{they were the most}} likely to give him playing time in the NHL. He made his debut with the team on October 6, 2000. He struggled at first, failing to score a goal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> weeks of the season and again found himself out of the lineup at times. Realizing that he was at a career crossroads, St. Louis abandoned the changes to his game that his NHL coaches had impressed on him, trusting his own instincts. He scored his first goal of the season in late November, and finished the season with 18 goals and 40 points – 34 of which came after December 1.|$|E
5|$|After a {{scoreless}} third quarter, with 8:08 to go, Alabama took possession {{at its own}} 32 {{following a}} Gamecock punt. Taking direct snaps out of the wildcat formation, Ingram rushed for 64 yards on five carries, then took a pitch from Greg McElroy {{for the last four}} yards and the touchdown, sealing Alabama's 20–6 victory. The Alabama offense turned the ball over four times in this game after committing only two turnovers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> games. Mark Ingram's 246 yards rushing marked his third consecutive career-high effort and the third highest single game total in Alabama history. For their performances, Ingram was named the SEC Offensive Player of the Week and Rolando McClain was named the Lott Trophy IMPACT Player of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Gamecocks to 10–3 (12–2 before NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|After {{the female}} lays the egg, the male incubates the egg while the female guards the nest. Males only leave the nest {{for a few}} hours to hunt, and during this time, the female takes over. It takes 75 to 85days for the egg to hatch. The kiwi chick takes 2 to 3 days simply to get out of its egg. Kiwi chicks are precocial, and are {{abandoned}} by their parents after hatching. After ten days, chicks venture out of the burrow to hunt. Most chicks are killed by predators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> months of their life. Great spotted kiwis reach full size at year six. Unlike most birds, female great spotted kiwis have two ovaries. Most birds have only one. Great spotted kiwis are distinguishable from other kiwi species {{by the fact that they}} can only produce one egg a year, as it takes so much energy to produce the massive egg.|$|E

5|$|At the time, 404 {{would have}} been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach their target, and the local press wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, scoring only six runs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> overs on a pitch offering spin and bounce. It appeared they were playing carefully at first before deciding whether to try to achieve the target at a later point. In Bedser's second over, the third of the innings, Morris chipped the ball in the air towards mid-wicket, in a similar manner to his first innings dismissal, but this time the ball evaded Cranston. After 15 minutes, Australia had only made 0/10.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy cannot {{usually be}} cured, but {{medication}} can control seizures effectively in about 70% of cases. Of those with generalized seizures, more than 80% can be well controlled with medications {{while this is}} true in only 50% of people with focal seizures. One predictor of long-term outcome {{is the number of}} seizures that occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> months. Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment, generalized seizures, a family history of epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity. In the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated. In Africa, 90% do not get treatment. This is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive.|$|E
5|$|Howarth {{started his}} career in the youth system of {{hometown}} club York City in 1996 while a schoolboy, before becoming a trainee in 1998. He made his first-team debut aged 17, playing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> matches of the 1999–2000 season. During this run in the team, he signed a professional contract with the club. However, he was unable to play regularly for York because of the form of Bobby Mimms and Alan Fettis. After having trials with Premier League and First Division clubs, Howarth left York in November 2002 to sign for Tranmere Rovers for a five-figure fee. Here, he again played sporadically, only having runs in the team when first-choice goalkeeper John Achterberg was unavailable. After being released by Tranmere in 2005, Howarth signed for Bradford City. However, he was unable to dislodge Donovan Ricketts in goal and was released in 2007. He retired from football and started working as a paramedic.|$|E
