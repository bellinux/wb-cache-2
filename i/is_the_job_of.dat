5|$|The Court of Appeal {{emphasized}} that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive unfairness. Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive's policy-making powers, {{as it is for}} public authorities, acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> the courts to determine whether an authority's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|Once a kit {{has reached}} six moons old, they become ‘{{apprentice}}s’. As {{a mark of}} this, each kit is now given the suffix ‘paw’. For example, ‘Graykit’ would become ‘Graypaw’. An apprentice is then assigned to a ‘mentor’. Mentors are often carefully chosen {{in order to fulfill}} an apprentice’s full potential; for example, a rather highly-strung apprentice would be given to a calmer mentor, whilst a more timid apprentice would be given to a mentor known for their bravery. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> a mentor to train their apprentice for any given situation, teaching them to hunt, fight, and patrol borders. Apprentices move out of the nursery and sleep in their own separate den. In addition to training, apprentices are also tasked with keeping the camp clean.|$|E

The videotape editor used the director's notes so they knew which scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might have asked for further changes to be made.

That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident.

500|$|Absent {{mothers and}} abusive fathers are another {{theme in the}} novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could {{remember}} her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers. Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house {{to the extent that}} Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men, as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society, can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{decision}} written by Chief Justice Roberts, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Eighth Circuit's decision. Associate Justice Elena Kagan recused herself {{from participating in}} the case, as she had signed the government's brief during her tenure as Solicitor General of the United States. Declining to review using a standard set out in National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v. United States (1979), the Court instead used a standard set out in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (1984). Chevron, a landmark case regarding deference to government agencies, instituted a two-part test: The job of the reviewing court is to first establish whether Congress has unambiguously spoken about the matter. If so, the court is to follow Congress' intent. If not, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> the court {{to determine whether the}} agency's statutory interpretation was a reasonable one. National Muffler, on the other hand, requires that reviewing courts take into account [...] "whether the regulation harmonizes with the plain language of the statute, its origin, and its purpose" [...] and states that courts may examine a statutory interpretation made years after the passage of the original act on the merits. The Mayo Foundation had requested that the Court rule according to the National Muffler standard, while the United States argued that the Court should use the Chevron standard, arguing that National Muffler had been superseded. The Court had in fact cited both cases in opinions since 1984, but agreed with the Government's position, stating {{that it would not be}} wise to [...] "carve out an approach to administrative review good for tax law only".|$|E

For example, for a machine that lacks a [...] "branch if greater or equal" [...] instruction, an assembler may provide a pseudoinstruction that expands to the machine's [...] "set if less than" [...] and [...] "branch if zero (on {{the result of the}} set instruction)".

The audit committee is not required to be the sole body responsible for risk assessment and management, but, as stated above, the committee must discuss guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken.
