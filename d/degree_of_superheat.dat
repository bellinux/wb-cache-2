40|$|The textural {{features}} {{produced in}} Stannern, a non-porpyritic {{representative of the}} eucrite basaltic achondrite class of meteorite, at differing cooling rates and various <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> initial <b>superheating</b> were studied. Textures produced from mildly superheated melts {{were found to be}} fasciculate rather than porphyritic {{as the result of the}} cosaturated bulk chemistry of Stannern. The qualitative type of texture apparently depends mainly on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> initial <b>superheating,</b> whereas cooling rate exerts a strong influence on the coarseness of texture. Increasing the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>superheating</b> produces textures from intergranular/subophitic to fasciculate/porphyritic. With initial superheating to 1200 deg C the transition to quasi-porphyritic is controlled by cooling rate, but the development of phenocrysts is merely an overprint on the fasciculate background texture of the groundmass. The suppression of fasciculate texture is completed by a decrease <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> initial <b>superheating</b> below the plagioclast entry and suppression of quasi-porphyritic texture is completed by decrease <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> initial <b>superheating</b> below pyroxene entry; these qualitative changes do not seem to be produced by changes of cooling rate. A grain size/cooling rate dependence has been used to deduce the cooling rate of fasciculate-textured Stannern clasts (10. 1 to 100 deg C/hr) ...|$|R

The laminar boundary-layer equations for the flow of vapor beneath the heated plate are solved using an integral method and the solution is obtaind analytically. Numerical results of the solution are examined for saturated water at atmospheric pressure. It is shown that (1) the vapor film has a maximum thickness {{at the center of the}} plate and that its thickness decreases towards the edge. The vapor film becomes thicker with an increase of the plate width or <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>superheating,</b> (2) the convection heat transfer is strongly affected by the plate width, and (3) the radiation heat transfer and its contribution to the convection heat transfer can not be neglected when the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>superheating</b> is large...|$|R

50|$|Like the Class 14, the Class 14B had Walschaerts {{valve gear}} and a Belpaire firebox. Because it was {{intended}} for use on the lower section of the Natal mainline, D.A. Hendrie, Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR), concluded that no high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>superheat</b> would be attainable and the locomotives were therefore ordered without superheaters. They were intended for use on the Town Hill section near Pietermaritzburg, where the old line was on a 1 in 30 (3⅓%) gradient and where speeds were low with frequent stops which, it was reasoned, would not justify the use of superheating.|$|E
50|$|No. 737, {{the last}} {{locomotive}} {{of the first}} batch, is believed by John Marshall {{to have been the}} first British superheated locomotive. The front tubeplate of the boiler was recessed, creating a cylindrical space into which the superheater was mounted. This consisted of a drum 3 ft long through which were a number of tubes for the hot gases to pass through. It offered only a low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>superheat</b> - 95 F above the normal steam temperature. The last five locomotives of the 1902 batch, nos. 1420-4, were given the same apparatus when new, but it was removed from all six by 1917.|$|E
50|$|The {{last five}} {{locomotives}} of Henry Fowler's Patriot class on order, 5552 to 5557, were built with William Stanier’s taper boiler and so {{became the first}} of the Jubilee class. 113 locomotives were ordered straight from the drawing board.

50|$|Additionally, Churchward's bar framed bogie {{which had}} been adapted for the {{original}} Hall prototype in 1924 {{was replaced by a}} plate frame structure with individual springing. There were changes, too, above the running board. Hawksworth decided that the declining quality of coal reaching Great Western depots necessitated a higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>superheating.</b> A larger three-row superheater and header regulator were fitted into Swindon No.1 boiler. Improvements were subsequently made to the draughting on some engines, while others were fitted with hopper ashpans.|$|R

50|$|Of all the {{locomotives}} introduced during Hendrie's term as CME, the Class 14B was {{the only}} one to fall short of expectations. In fairness to Hendrie and his decision to omit superheating, it should be borne in mind that, at the time, automatic dampers were still in use, which cut out the superheater while the regulator was closed. This reduced much of the superheater's effectiveness on undulating track and where frequent stops are required. A report had been submitted in Natal earlier to the effect that superheating was of little or no advantage on that System, where the many short and steep gradients prevented a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>superheat</b> from being attained with the automatic dampers in use at the time. In view of the added cost and weight of the superheating equipment, the arguments against it in Natal were therefore considered reasonable at the time.|$|E

The first of the Vulcan Foundry engines entered service in 1934, and the entire order of 50 was {{delivered}} before the first Crewe-built engine, no. 5000, was completed in February 1935. The first 57 locomotives were built with domeless boilers with straight throatplates and a low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>superheat</b> (14 elements in two rows), the boilers of the remaining 13 (5007-5019) were provided with a three-row version (21 elements) having greater total surface area and giving less obstruction to gas flow. The original 57 boilers were converted later to higher superheat (24 elements) and fitted with a dome. Further orders were placed with Crewe (5070-5074), Vulcan Foundry (5075-5124) and Armstrong Whitworth (5125-5224) {{for a total of}} 155 locomotives which were also built with domeless boilers with straight throatplates and 21 element superheaters.

An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) {{waste heat recovery system}} with internal heat exchanger (IHE) was designed to recover waste heat from the diesel engine exhaust. The zeotropic mixture R 416 A was used as the working fluid for the ORC. Three evaluation indexes were presented as follows: waste heat recovery efficiency (WHRE), engine thermal efficiency increasing ratio (ETEIR), and output energy density of working fluid (OEDWF). In terms of various operating conditions of the diesel engine, this study investigated the variation tendencies of the running performances of the ORC waste heat recovery system and the effects of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>superheat</b> on the running performance of the ORC waste heat recovery system through theoretical calculations.

The optimization of the evaporation temperature is carried out by analyzing the variation of net power output and specific investment cost (SIC). Then, the net power output, specific net power output, total exergy destruction rate, VFR, total capital cost, and levelized electricity cost (LEC) are selected as criteria, and a fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation method is adopted to select a more suitable working fluid and determine the optimal <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>superheat.</b> In addition, the preheating coefficient, latent heat coefficient, superheating coefficient, and internal heat coefficient were proposed to explore the effect of working fluid critical temperature on thermal efficiency.

Visual observation showed that steam condensed by dropwise condensation in part. Increase of superheat in the vapor at constant pressure caused a lowering of the tube-wall temperature, which was indicative of a lowering of the surface temperature of the condensate.
