500|$|General Prem Chand was {{particularly}} anxious about Bunche's visit. Keenly aware of this, Bunche {{did his best}} to alleviate the general's worries, asking to stay at his residence in Élisabethville instead of a hotel. Prem Chand was alarmed when Bunche presented him with a letter from Thant, but Bunche reached <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> pulled out a suggested response. The general was surprised by the accuracy of the draft in its considerations of the military situation of UN troops during the advance, though the following day he gave Bunche a full explanation of what had occurred. In his official report on the events in Katanga, Bunche concluded, [...] "I have found beyond doubt that it is our machinery that is at fault, far more than the individuals." [...] He returned to UN Headquarters on 10 January with an official apology from ONUC commanders. Thant later commented on the matter, writing, [...] "I felt that it was I, not they, who should have apologised for my miscalculation and apprehensions based on scare reports from London and Brussels." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{town meeting}} {{attracted}} a packed crowd of over a thousand, with Nixon supporters distributing anti-Voorhis literature at the door. The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates, followed by Voorhis. Nixon, who had notified organizers {{that he would}} be late due to another commitment, arrived during Voorhis's speech, and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk. He then came onstage, shook hands with Voorhis, and delivered a fifteen-minute address. A question-and-answer period then followed, with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration, and about his views on monetary policy. [...] After the representative responded, a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making [...] "false charges" [...] about the supposed Voorhis CIO-PAC endorsement. [...] In response, Nixon reached <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> pulled out a copy of a Southern California NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group's endorsement of Voorhis. [...] The congressman was unaware of the endorsement; those of his aides in the know had [...] "completely forgotten" [...] to tell him. [...] Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis, asking him to read it for himself. Voorhis came from his seat and took it, and (according to Bullock, who served as timekeeper at the debate) [...] "mumbled" [...] that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO-PAC. [...] Nixon reclaimed the document, and began to read out names {{of the members of the}} boards of directors of the two groups, [...] "It's the same thing, virtually, when they have the same directors." [...] The crowd began to cheer Nixon, who later wrote, [...] "I could tell by the audience reaction that I had made my point", and to jeer Voorhis, who wrote, [...] "They'd boo and laugh at my remarks, and this disturbed me." ...|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Halvorsen's {{role in the}} Berlin Airlift was to fly one of many C-54 cargo planes used {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} into the starving city. During his flights he would first fly to Berlin, then deeper into Soviet-controlled areas. Halverson {{had an interest in}} photography and on his days off often went sightseeing in Berlin and shot film on his personal handheld movie camera. One day in July, he was filming plane takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof, the main landing site for the airlift. While there, he saw about thirty children lined up behind one of the barbed-wire fences. He went to meet them and noticed that the children had nothing. Halvorsen remembers: [...] "I met about thirty children at the barbed wire fence that protected Tempelhof's huge area. They were excited and told me that 'when the weather gets so bad that you can't land, don't worry about us. We can get by on a little food, but if we lose our freedom, we may never get it back.'" [...] Touched, Halvorsen reached <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> took out two sticks of gum to give to the children. The kids broke it into little pieces and shared it; the ones who did not get any sniffed the wrappers. Watching the children, so many of whom had absolutely nothing, Halvorsen regretted not having more to give them. Halvorsen recorded that he wanted to do more for the children, and so told them that the following day he would have enough gum for all of them, and he would drop it out of his plane. According to Halvorsen, one child asked [...] "How will we know it is your plane?" [...] to which Halvorsen responded that he would wiggle his wings, something he had done for his parents when he first got his pilot's license in 1941.|$|E
2500|$|In the [...] "dirt in pocket" [...] affair, then England captain Michael Atherton {{was accused}} of ball {{tampering}} during a Test match with South Africa at Lord's in 1994 after television cameras caught Atherton reaching <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> then rubbing a substance on the ball. Atherton denied ball tampering, claiming that he had dirt in his pocket which he used to dry his hands. He was also accused of lying to the match referee. Atherton was summoned to the match referee and was fined £2,000 for failing to disclose the dirt to the match referee.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1969 general election, the Alliance {{suffered}} substantial losses. The MCA, {{which was}} hardest hit, decided {{to withdraw from}} the government as they felt they were no longer representative of the Chinese community. Ismail was very critical of this decision, and attempted to persuade the MCA President, Tan Siew Sin, to change his mind. Ismail warned that [...] "this decision if not revoked would contribute to rioting and chaos in the country". On 13 May, after several controversial victory rallies were held by the victorious opposition, racial riots broke out in the federal capital, Kuala Lumpur. Ismail's daughter later said that her father [...] "remained calm, but took out his pistol, put it <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> went out with my mother to dinner". On the morning of 14 May, a police escort was dispatched by Tun Abdul Razak, the Deputy Prime Minister, to escort Ismail from his home. Ismail was persuaded to rejoin the government as home affairs minister.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the battles}} with Villa, Obregón had {{his right arm}} blown off. The blast nearly killed him, and he {{attempted}} to put himself out of his misery and fired his pistol to accomplish that. [...] The aide de camp who had cleaned his gun had neglected to put bullets in the weapon. In a wry story he told about himself, he joined {{in the search for}} his missing arm. [...] "I was helping them myself, because it's not so easy to abandon such a necessary thing as an arm." [...] The searchers had no luck. A comrade reached <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> raised a gold coin. Obregón concluded the story, saying [...] "And then everyone saw a miracle: the arm came forth from who knows where, and come skipping up to where the gold azteca [...] was elevated; it reached up and grasped it in its fingers--lovingly--That {{was the only way to}} get my lost arm to appear." [...] The arm was subsequently embalmed and then put in the monument to Obregón on the site of where he was assassinated in 1928. Obregón always wore clothing tailored to show that he had lost his arm in battle, a visible sign of his sacrifice to Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Out of caution, Radić was {{quieter than}} usual at the {{following}} evening's session of parliament. A verbal confrontation erupted that night when HSS deputy Ivan Pernar shouted insults at several Serbian politicians, questioning their wartime record and suggesting they were responsible for committing atrocities. Croatian politician Lubomir Maštović then made a speech protesting how the death threats against Radić made by Popović and Račić the previous day had gone unpunished {{by the president of}} the Assembly, Ninko Perić. Popović responded by saying [...] "...if Stjepan Radić, who shames the Croatian people, further continues with his insults, I guarantee that his head will fall." [...] The opposition benches reacted by shouting insults and death threats at the NRS party deputies, who responded in similar fashion. Perić ordered a five-minute recess and retreated to his private chamber, where he spoke with Račić. Račić was given the floor when the session was resumed. In his speech, he asserted that Serbian interests had never been in greater danger and stated that he would not refrain from using [...] "other weapons, as need be, to defend the interests of Serbdom". Opposing politicians, especially Pernar, responded by taunting Račić and shouting as he spoke. Račić demanded that Perić penalize those jeering at his speech. Pernar then shouted [...] "you plundered beys!", accusing Račić of looting Muslim homes in Macedonia. Seeing that Perić was not going to reprimand Pernar, Račić reached <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> produced a handgun. The Minister of Justice, Milorad Vujičić, who was sitting behind the podium, grabbed Račić by the back while the former Minister of Religion, Obradović, seized his right shoulder. Račić pushed both men away and shot Pernar first. He then turned his attention to Ivan Granđa and shot him. He attempted to shoot Svetozar Pribićević just as HSS deputy Đuro Basariček jumped to the podium. Račić aimed at Pribićević but shot Basariček instead. He then shot Radić in the hand and stomach. Radić's nephew, Pavle, rushed to help his uncle. Upon seeing him, Račić yelled [...] "I was waiting for you!" [...] and shot him at point-blank range. He then fled the chamber. Basariček and Radić's nephew died immediately. Pernar and Granđa were wounded but survived. Radić was seriously wounded and was taken to hospital immediately, where he was visited by King Alexander I.|$|E
