The critically acclaimed “Rampant Calamities” EP was released on Norton’s Faultine Records label in 2005 and the band shot {{to the top of}} the heavy music scene in Australia touring nationally with Mudvayne, Slipknot and Hatebreed. With interest from Roadrunner Records in the U.S. the band was set for big things. Tensions between the band a vocalist Jamie Ludbrook ultimately lead to the front man’s departure and after trying various other singers and recording the unreleased EP “A Winsome Savage” with frontman and good friend Matt “Cuz” Curry, the band struggled to find time for another serious attempt and in 2009 went into hiatus. Norton took time out from music, retiring from studio producing in 2011 and going into business. He is the co-owner of East Brunswick Tattoos and Whole Lotta Love bar in Melbourne. He is also the director of several successful companies. In 2014 after a trip to Egypt he returned to music. Writing and recording material for his solo project RIFLEMAN. dw Norton is dedicated vegan and has tentatively titled his solo album I Vegan. Drew Dedman went on to form an improvised jazz band, The Lounge Machine in 2004, and played with Melbourne drum and bass act K-Oscillate in 2005-2006. [...] In 2008 he reunited with Joey Biro and they formed the band metal core band Lanstrum.

40|$|First {{contract}} arbitration (FCA) {{provisions are}} posed {{as a solution}} to the difficulties of negotiating a first contract for newly certified bargaining units. FCA is a longstanding, and no longer controversial, element of Canadian labor legislation. FCA provisions now exist in six Canadian jurisdictions and four distinct FCA models have developed (the <b>exceptional</b> <b>remedy</b> or fault model, the automatic access model, the no-fault model, and the mediation intensive model). In the United States the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA) included a highly contested proposal to amend the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to include an FCA provision similar to the Canadian automatic access model. This chapter offers a balanced assessment of FCA evidence from Canada addressing the main objections to FCA in the EFCA debates. Individual case level data from jurisdictions representing each of the four FCA models is examined. The evidence demonstrates that although FCA is widely available in Canada, it is an option that is rarely sought and, when sought, rarely granted, that parties involved in FCA are able to establish stable bargaining relationships, and, that this process does not, as critics charge, simply prolong the life of nonviable bargaining units. This chapter concludes by suggesting that the practice under Quebec’s 2 ̆ 2 no-fault 2 ̆ 2 model and British Columbia 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 mediation intensive 2 ̆ 2 model merit consideration for adoption elsewhere. These models position the FCA process as a mechanism fostering collective bargaining and voluntary agreements, rather than treating it as a remedy for dysfunctional negotiations and as part of the unfair labor practice framework...|$|E

The decomposition in finer-grained services allows the usage of hardware clusters and a flexible serviceto-server allocation but also increases the complexity of administration. Thus, new administration techniques like our self-organizing infrastructure that we developed {{in cooperation with the}} SAP Adaptive Computing Infrastructure (ACI) group are necessary. For our purpose the available hardware is virtualized, pooled, and monitored. A fuzzy logic based controller module supervises all services running on the hardware platform and <b>remedies</b> <b>exceptional</b> situations automatically. With this self-organizing infrastructure we reduce the necessary hardware and administration overhead and, thus, lower the total cost of ownership (TCO). We used our prototype implementation, called Auto-Globe, for SAP-internal tests and we performed comprehensive simulation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed concept. 1...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the civil}} {{ceremony}} {{did not take}} place before the Brazilian authorities but in the Portuguese Embassy, a question then arose regarding the manner of recognizing the marriage in the Law of Brazil. In the wake of the Proclamation of the Republic in Brazil, Separation of Church and State had been instituted, and Catholic weddings no longer had automatic civil effect. Actually, between 1890 and 1937, religious weddings could have no civil effect at all, and all couples marrying in Brazil were obliged to undergo a civil ceremony of marriage before a Justice of the Peace, even if they also wanted to have a (legally unrecognized) religious wedding before of after that. However, in 1937, Brazil had adopted legislation that permitted the recognition of civil effects to religious weddings, but in order for the wedding to be thus recognized, a set of pre-marriage bureaucratic procedures had to be followed. The couple, however, failed to follow those procedures. The groom and his family had assumed that the civil effect question would have been resolved by the civil wedding at the Portuguese Embassy. Another factor, though less decisive, was that some in the bride's family refused to recognize the Brazilian Republic, the Separation of Church and State, and the Laws of Republican Brazil that imposed conditions for the civil recognition of a Catholic wedding and thus behaved as if the Catholic wedding had full effect in and of isef, as was the case during the previous imperal era. So, no real study had been made prior to the wedding about what would be required for it to be recognized in Brazil. Therefore, a problem arose, because the Brazilian authorities initially refused to recognize both the Portuguese Embassy wedding and the Catholic wedding. The reason for Brazil not recognizing the Embassy wedding was that Brazil usually only recognized marriages contracted before diplomatic or consular officials of foreign Nations when both parties where of the same nationality, and were getting married before a representative of their country. But the bride was a Brazilian citizen, and the groom was a German-born naturalized Portuguese citizen. Thus the Embassy wedding did not meet the criteria for recognition, as Brazilian authorities insisted that a marriage of two people of different nationalities in Brazil needed to be conducted under the Brazilian Laws, especially if one of the parties was a Brazilian national. As for the Catholic wedding, since the religious ceremony had not been preceded by the recently created bureaucratic pre-marriage procedure for a religious wedding to have civil effect in Brazil, the Brazilian authorities initially would not recognize it. So the marriage was already recognized under the Laws of the Portuguese Republic, and was even recognized by the Royal House of Portugal and the Imperial House of Brazil (both Sovereign Houses regarded the Catholic marriage as the relevant one, in accordance with the laws that had prevailed in the former Kingdom of Portugal and in the former Empire of Brazil), but it could not be recognized in the then current Brazilian Civil Law, unless extraordinary measures were adopted to remedy the situation. Celebrating a new civil marriage was out of the question, both because it would imply that the Brazilian bride was living with her husband but was not yet fully married to him (the couple started living together after the second ceremony, that is, after the Catholic wedding), and also because the pre-marriage habitilation process for Brazilian civil ceremony (that would have been the third marriage ceremony) would take several weeks. So, the only solution was to obtain from the Brazilian authorities a special act of recognition of one of the two weddings already celebrated, and that was what was done in the days that followed. After influential entrepreneur Assis Chateaubriand Bandeira de Mello brought the problem to the attention of high-ranking Brazilian authorities, the Brazilian Government agreed to take <b>exceptional</b> measures to <b>remedy</b> the situation of the royal couple.|$|R

Violations of the multivariate normality assumption in covariance structure modeling (CSM) procedures are a common occurrence that can substantially impact the statistical and practical implications of research results. Numerous potential remedies for the impact of nonnormality on CSM have been suggested, including different estimation methods and robust calculations of test statistics and parameter estimates; however, each have their limitations and drawbacks. An additional remedy termed bootstrapping has been long advocated as an adequate means to minimize the effects of nonnormality; however, there have been no large-scale simulation studies aimed at exploring bootstrapping's actual utility. The present study employed Monte Carlo simulation and model-based bootstrapping methods to investigate the impact of sample size and data nonnormality on several CSM fit statistics and indices, parameter estimation bias, and parameter standard error bias. The specified model and population matrix were from a well-studied model of alienation that has been used in previous simulation research. The results found that bootstrapping mitigated the impact of larger sample sizes and moderate nonnormality on three chi-square test statistics but resulted in fit indices that approached their theoretical "ideal" boundaries {{that could lead to a}} biased perception of model fit. Bootstrapping did not diminish the impact of nonnormality on parameter estimation biases and actually increased bias in smaller sample sizes. Finally, although bootstrapping did reduce bias in standard error estimates for model variances and covariances, bias for indicator loadings and structural paths increased in the bootstrapped samples. Collectively, the present results suggest that bootstrapping may not be the <b>exceptional</b> <b>remedy</b> for nonnormality as has been suggested by previous writers and several implications of these findings are discussed. Due to the scant amount of research on bootstrapping, however, several directions for future research are presented...|$|E
40|$|The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) {{is celebrating}} its halfcentury {{existence}} this year. Having presided over more than 525 cases in various topics including annulment; {{it is no surprise}} that it is described as the premier international investment arbitration institution in the world. Annulment was designed as an <b>exceptional</b> <b>remedy</b> to safeguard against violation of fundamental legal principles. This provision, enshrined in the ICSID Convention of 1966, stands out as the 'art', 'crown' and 'jewel' of ICSID jurisprudence. The annual number of cases registered by ICSID increased rapidly in the last decade. To date, there are 160 signatories and contracting states to the ICSID Convention. Awards rendered under this mechanism are binding and have been successfully implemented without interference by domestic courts. What this statistic fails to show is that the rate of annulment has increased considerably. This implies that out of every 344 arbitration cases registered; 150 ICSID Convention awards have been rendered and 53 annulment proceedings instituted. This is against the background that only few annulment applications existed in the institutions' early years. This remedy has been pursued by both claimants and respondents to ICSID proceedings. Approximately 57 percent of annulment proceedings have been initiated by respondents (in all instances, states), 36 percent by claimants and 7 percent by both parties. The annulment mechanism is deployed by ICSID in lieu of providing an appellate option. Dissatisfied parties have employed this mechanism to challenge awards rendered by the institution. It follows that, despite the institution's uniqueness and widely recognised success in international arbitration, annulment negates the principle of finality and certainty ? one of the core principles of arbitration. The above flaw has led to the withdrawal of Latin America countries from the ICSID Convention. Bolivia was the first to withdraw as it denounced its membership in 2007. This was followed by Ecuador in 2010 and Venezuela in 2012. Countries like the United States, South Africa and Germany have also revisited this provision and called for review of the whole system. This research calls for reform of the ICSID annulment mechanism. It arrives at practical alternatives to be adopted by the institution aimed at creating finality and predictability in the international arbitration system. This mini-dissertation argues that finality and predictability can be achieved under ICSID by establishing an appellate mechanism drawing lessons from the institutional framework of the World Trade Organization Appellate Body Dispute Settlement System (WTO - DSS). If the annulment mechanism negates the principle of finality in international arbitration, then the ICSID objective of attaining predictability in international arbitration remains fictitious. This research therefore adds to the growing voice that argues that amendment of the annulment procedure is long overdue. tm 2017 Centre for Human RightsLLMUnrestricte...|$|E
