25|$|The first {{attempts}} to bring platform games into 3D used 2D graphics and an isometric perspective. These games are nearly {{as old as}} the genre itself, one of the earliest examples being Sega's Congo Bongo in 1983. The first platformers to simulate a 3D perspective and moving camera emerged in the early-mid-1980s. An early example of this was Konami's platform game Antarctic Adventure, where the player controls a penguin in a forward-scrolling third-person perspective while having to jump over pits and obstacles. Originally released in 1983 for the MSX computer, it was subsequently ported to various platforms the following year, including an arcade version, NES, and ColecoVision. That same year, I, Robot, though not a platformer, featured filled 3D polygonal graphics, <b>flat</b> <b>shading,</b> and camera control options, which were not widely adopted by platformers until the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|Starglider 2 is a 3D space combat {{simulator}} {{published in}} 1988 by Rainbird as {{the sequel to}} 1986's Starglider. It was released for the Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS, Macintosh and ZX Spectrum. Instead of the wireframe graphics of the original, Starglider 2 uses <b>flat</b> <b>shaded</b> polygons.|$|R

40|$|Image {{segmentation}} is {{a fundamental}} problem in early computer vision. In segmentation of <b>flat</b> <b>shaded,</b> nontextured objects in real-world images, objects are usually assumed to be piece-wise homogeneous. This assumption, however, is not always valid with images such as medical images. As a result, any techniques based on this assumption may produce less than satisfactory image segmentation...|$|R
50|$|CAD-3D {{is a basic}} {{polygonal}} 3D {{modeling and}} rendering program. An operator can assemble a scene out of geometric primitives or custom extruded or lathed objects. Various view ports are available to adjust lighting and camera positioning. The limited rendering functionality allows for <b>flat</b> <b>shading</b> in 16 shades. Rendered images can be exported in Degas Elite or NeoChrome format.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>flat</b> <b>shading</b> where the colors change discontinuously at polygon borders, with smooth shading the color changes from pixel to pixel, {{resulting in a}} smooth color transition between two adjacent polygons.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} rank different types of display formats common to CAD applications in terms of geometric information conveyed and perceived realism of objects. Display types tested were: wireframe, wireframe with hidden lines removed (HLR), shaded solid, orthogonal multi-view, stereoscopic wireframe, stereoscopic HLR, and stereoscopic shaded solid. The results of the geometric information experiment indicated that the orthogonal multi-view display was judged inferior to both the non-stereo and stereo pictorial displays and that the stereo displays were judged superior to the non-stereo displays in providing geometric information to the subject. Individual preferences among subjects, however, varied widely. The results of the realism experiment indicated that the <b>flat</b> <b>shaded</b> stereo, HLR stereo, and the <b>flat</b> <b>shaded</b> display types were judged to be equivalent and most realistic. The wireframe stereo, HLR and wireframe displays were judged to be equivalent and less realistic. The orthogonal views display was judged {{to be the least}} realistic...|$|R
5000|$|Solvalou (Sorubarū) is a first-person shooter arcade game {{which was}} {{released}} by Namco in 1991; it runs on Namco System 21 ("Polygonizer") hardware, which displayed the game very smoothly with <b>flat</b> <b>shaded</b> polygons. The game is controlled with an analog (vertically-reversed) joystick with two buttons - one for firing {{and the other for}} bombing. It is also the third title in the Xevious series.|$|R

Kutaragi was upset that SCEA was spending its limited budget on an alternative brand. [...] "But the thing that really upset Ken was that the Polygon Man design wasn’t Gouraud <b>shaded,</b> it was <b>flat</b> <b>shaded!</b> So Polygon Man was taken out into the car park and quietly shot." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{increasing}} {{computing power}} and decreasing cost of processors {{such as the}} Intel 80386, Intel 80486, and Motorola 68030, caused the rise of 3D graphics, and multimedia abilities through sound cards and CD-ROMs. Early 3D games began with <b>flat</b> <b>shading</b> graphics (Elite, Starglider 2 or Alpha Waves), and then simple forms of texture mapping (such as in Wolfenstein 3D).|$|E
50|$|Here, a {{color is}} {{calculated}} for one point on each polygon (usually {{for the first}} vertex in the polygon, but sometimes for the centroid for triangle meshes), based on the polygon's surface normal and {{on the assumption that}} all polygons are flat. The color everywhere else is then interpolated by coloring all points on a polygon the same as the point for which the color was calculated, giving each polygon a uniform color (similar to in nearest-neighbor interpolation). It is usually used for high speed rendering where more advanced shading techniques are too computationally expensive. As a result of <b>flat</b> <b>shading</b> all of the polygon's vertices are colored with one color, allowing differentiation between adjacent polygons. Specular highlights are rendered poorly with flat shading: If there happens to be a large specular component at the representative vertex, that brightness is drawn uniformly over the entire face. If a specular highlight doesn’t fall on the representative point, it is missed entirely. Consequently, the specular reflection component is usually not included in <b>flat</b> <b>shading</b> computation.|$|E

This was later redone {{by some of the}} previous members of Future Crew working for Remedy Entertainment as part of the benchmarking demo Final Reality. <b>Flat</b> <b>shading</b> is used for the buildings and Gouraud shading for the smooth trees and lettering at the end.|-| ...|$|E
50|$|Roman shades are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} styles. Both Looped Roman Shades and Classic Roman Shades are designed to create depth and dimension. Looped Roman Shades, also known as hobbled shades, have folds that cascade down the face of the shade to help create depth, while Classic Roman Shades offer a pleated design that can be batten front or batten back. Roman shades are also available in a seamless style, which feature a smooth or <b>flat</b> <b>shade</b> face.|$|R
5000|$|Nearly {{all of the}} polygons {{which form}} the players and environments are <b>flat</b> <b>shaded,</b> unusual at time when most games applied texture mapping. Lewis Peterson of Activision said of this that [...] "Part of it was an {{aesthetic}} decision. More importantly, a texture-mapped polygon costs about 10 times the processor budget of a flat-shaded polygon, {{so we had to}} make a decision as to whether or not we wanted one big texture-mapped polygon, or [...] " ...|$|R
40|$|Light intensivity of {{attraction}} lamps used on squid fishing boats has greatly increased since the introduce from of the automatic squid jigging machine in about 1972. Oil price rises {{after the first}} and second oil schocks have put increased economic pressures on fisherman. In order to test the efficiency of shades used with the attraction lamp lights, four types of shades were used for test; "Flat shade","Double shade", "Double and one-side reflection shade" and "Spot type". Only the <b>flat</b> <b>shade</b> is being used commercialy. The other three were made for test purposes at this time...|$|R

5000|$|The cars {{can drive}} on paved roads, gravel roads, icy/snow roads, and grass if driving {{off the track}} [...] - [...] which all offer {{different}} levels of grip. The game has a relatively advanced pseudo-physics engine for its time which can simulate oversteer and understeer; grip is also proportional to the banking of a curve. The game features a 3D engine with <b>flat</b> <b>shading</b> and no textures, it uses polygonal graphics for most objects, including trees and road signs, there are few sprites. The resolution is 320×200 with 256 colors. There is an option to select high and low detail. The game is written for DOS and executes in real mode.|$|E
50|$|In the {{geometry}} of computer graphics, a vertex normal at a vertex of a polyhedron is a directional vector associated with a vertex, intended as a replacement to the true geometric normal of the surface. Commonly, it is computed as the normalized average of the surface normals of the faces that contain that vertex. The average can be weighted for example by {{the area of the}} face or it can be unweighted. Vertex normals can also be computed for polygonal approximations to surfaces such as NURBS, or specified explicitly for artistic purposes. Vertex normals are used in Gouraud shading, Phong shading and other lighting models. Using vertex normals, much smoother shading than <b>flat</b> <b>shading</b> can be achieved; however, without some modifications, it cannot produce a sharp edge.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{potentially}} interesting game setting, the technical realisation was quite {{not up to}} 1995 standards, since the game used texture-less <b>flat</b> <b>shaded</b> polygonal 3D graphics in an era where the more advanced technology of texture mapping was the de facto standard for PC games ( [...] e.g. Doom, Duke Nukem 3D or The Need for Speed). This would make Cyberbykes {{one of the last}} commercially released PC games using untextured polygonal graphics (with the exception of Fade to Black, which however also used textures and had better shading effects).|$|R
50|$|There are {{multiple}} game modes including single race and tag. Players {{can choose from}} different areas like the Old West, San Francisco, or {{the inside of a}} giant house. As with most early 3D racing games, Club Drive uses little or no textures, instead using <b>flat</b> <b>shaded</b> polygons. The player must gather Power Balls scattered throughout the different racing stages to advance to the next level or must finish the circuit on the stage that the player is on. Club Drive also features a two-player mode. There are also secret passage ways that would teleport the player into bizarre places.|$|R
50|$|The console {{releases}} of Alone in the Dark 2 included a port for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer released in 1995 {{which is very}} similar to the DOS CD-ROM version, and also versions released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in 1996 which featured reworked and fully textured polygonal models, instead of the <b>flat</b> <b>shaded</b> ones from the DOS versions and 3DO port. New FMV cutscenes were also added to these ports. All console releases were also published in Japan by Electronic Arts Victor, with the Sega Saturn and PlayStation versions being released as Alone in the Dark 2: Jack is Back.|$|R
50|$|Inevitably, certain {{sides of}} some objects (e.g. walls) {{in a game}} scene will never be visible to the player during normal play. The person making the map can apply the caulk texture, instead of a normal texture, to these {{surfaces}} when building the map. The surfaces become invisible in-game and if compiled into a Binary Space Partitioning-File (or BSP-Level) they will also not {{be added to the}} list of Leaves (or convex polygons). The resulting reduction of polygons and textures used in the video game level reduces the required video card resources, possibly making the map smoother to play. In the case that a surface which was not meant to be visible inadvertently becomes visible, possibly due to a mapping error, some game engines support drawing caulked surfaces using <b>flat</b> <b>shading.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of shading {{algorithms}} for rasterizers. All shading algorithms need to account for distance from light and the normal vector of the shaded object with respect to the incident direction of light. The fastest algorithms simply shade all pixels on any given triangle with a single lighting value, also known as <b>flat</b> <b>shading.</b> There is no way to create the illusion of smooth surfaces this way, except by subdividing into many small triangles. Algorithms can also separately shade vertices, and interpolate the lighting value of the vertices when drawing pixels. This is known as Gouraud shading. The slowest and most realistic approach is to calculate lighting separately for each pixel, also known as Phong shading. This performs bilinear interpolation of the normal vectors and uses the result to do local lighting calculation.|$|E

5000|$|Archie Blackowl {{was born}} in Custer County, Oklahoma, on November 23, 1911. I ndigenous artists, such as Blackowl, grew up being {{sensitive}} to nature. Archie's culture made him sensitive to natural textures, which created a traditional Indian school of painting (much like the Kiowa art movement from Oklahoma). This included <b>flat</b> <b>shaded</b> native images and was an encouraged style in art competitions (Oklahoma 1946). For the public, it encompassed a [...] "real Indian art" [...] which Archie helped to contribute to. Though some scholars {{say this is the}} only legitimate art, it proved to be a unique piece of a large mosaic of art.|$|R
500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were seen}} {{as one of the}} strongest aspects of the game. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote: [...] "graphically, Banjo-Kazooie takes it to another level. The game maintains {{the look and feel of}} Mario 64, but instead of <b>flat,</b> <b>shaded</b> polygons, [...] uses a lot of textures". The game's long draw distance, solid frame rate, special lighting, transparency effects, and animations were also highlighted very positively. Critics also praised the game's dynamic soundtrack. Schneider remarked that it [...] "lets players know where they are going. This happens all the time and in every level. It's all very Disney-esque." [...] The sound effects received similar praise, with several editors crediting the unique and diverse speech patterns of the characters.|$|R
