40|$|AbstractMarcellus Shale {{development}} is occurring rapidly and relatively unconstrained across Pennsylvania (PA). Through 2013, over 7400 unconventional wells had been drilled in the Commonwealth. Well pads, access roads, and <b>gathering</b> <b>lines</b> fragment forestland resulting in irreversible alterations {{to the forest}} ecosystem. Changes in forest quantity, composition, and structural pattern can result in increased predation, brood parasitism, altered light, wind, and noise intensity, and spread of invasive species. These fragmentation effects pose a risk to PA's rich biodiversity. This study projects the structure of future alternative pathways for Marcellus shale development and quantifies the potential ecological impact of future drilling using a core forest region of Bradford County, PA. Modeling presented here suggests that future development could cause the level of fragmentation {{in the study area}} to more than double throughout the lifetime of gas development. Specifically, <b>gathering</b> <b>lines</b> are responsible for approximately 94 % of the incremental fragmentation in the core forest study region. However, by requiring <b>gathering</b> <b>lines</b> to follow pre-existing road routes in forested regions, shale resources can be exploited to their full potential, while essentially preventing any further fragmentation from occurring across the core forested landscape of Bradford County. In the study region, assuming an estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of 1 – 3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per well, this policy could be implemented for a minimal incremental economic investment of approximately $ 0. 005 –$ 0. 02 per Mcf of natural gas produced over the modeled traditional gathering line development...|$|E

40|$|Challenged by {{the lack}} of {{research}} on the dynamic nature of value appropriation confronted with disruptive triggers this study aims to enhance the understanding of a relationship between discontinuity and value appropriation. More specifically the paper studies how a discontinuity impacts complex action patterns of the value appropriation process. Given that the defined research area remains not well understood, the investigation followed a qualitative approach using a field-based case study method governed by a multiple case design research strategy. To accomplish research propositions five in-depth case studies were performed. All cases concerned the path dependency breaking influence of discontinuities over value appropriation process in firms exhibiting highly intensive use of knowledge and technology in performed business activity. Extracted data enabled identification of discontinuities that occurred across different dimensions of environment and were addressed with path breaking alternations of value capturing practices. Obtained findings indicated that investigated firms exhibited a high responsiveness to sudden discontinuities. Deployed responses involved substantial changes in value appropriation, which concerned the quantity, diversity and combination of formal and informal isolating mechanisms. Structured reactions induced branching of current action patterns of value appropriation.
