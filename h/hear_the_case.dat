5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E

5|$|The Court has no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts. Most cases begin in local circuit courts, where the initial trial is held and a jury decides {{the outcome of the}} case. The circuit court decision can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana Tax Court, who can <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> or enforce the lower court's decision. If the parties still disagree with the outcome of the case, they can appeal the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Court can choose to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> and possibly overturn the previous judgment, or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of the lower courts.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, {{attempts}} {{to suppress the}} statements given by J. D. B. {{because he was not}} given a Miranda warning were denied on the grounds that J. D. B. was not in police custody.

5|$|Compromise {{having been}} exhausted, both sides agreed to litigate the matter.

5|$|The FCI {{refused to}} suspend Petacchi, and he {{returned}} to racing in late July.

The CAS heard the case, and Petacchi testified to the court, stating that the hot and humid day on which the stage was the run had made it so that he took several extra puffs from his inhaler, but that this was accidental and that most had come after he had already crossed the finish line and won the stage.|$|E
5|$|The Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota sued {{in federal}} court to {{overturn}} those regulations. The district courts agreed with them, but upon appeal, the Eighth Circuit consolidated the two cases into one and reversed the judgments, remanding the cases for entry of judgments {{in favor of the}} United States. This decision was at odds with decisions from the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits, which had all previously ruled that residents may count as students for the purpose of FICA taxes. The Eighth Circuit's ruling created a circuit split, and on appeal, the Supreme Court agreed to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{environmental}} groups that had filed the injunction appealed the decision, and on October 6, 1972, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. partially reversed Hart's decision. The appeals {{court said that}} although the impact statement followed the guidelines set by the National Environmental Policy Act, it did not follow the Minerals Leasing Act, which allowed for a smaller pipeline right of way than was required for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The oil companies and Alyeska appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in April 1973, the court declined to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following the Third Circuit's decision, Heffernan {{petitioned the}} Supreme Court for certiorari, {{requesting}} they <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> After the Court considered both Heffernan's petition and the city's reply, it granted the petition {{on the first}} day of the 2015 term. Both parties consented to the filing of amicus curiae briefs by uninvolved parties who believed they had a stake in the outcome of the case. The National Association of Government Employees, Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, and Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression filed amicus briefs in support of Heffernan, while the New Jersey State League of Municipalities and the National Conference of State Legislatures filed briefs in support of the City of Paterson. The United States government also filed an amicus brief in support of Heffernan, as well as a motion to appear at oral argument, which the Court granted, meaning the Solicitor General's office would be appearing at oral arguments, held on January 19, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the heated}} {{political}} {{environment of the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, allies of his father claimed that the governor's political enemies had framed his son. The governor's legislative allies passed legislation providing for a favorable change of venue for the trial, and the governor used his appointment power to ensure that sympathetic judges would <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Isaac Desha was twice convicted, but both times, {{the judge in the}} case set aside the verdict on procedural grounds. While awaiting a third trial, Desha attempted suicide by slitting his throat, but doctors saved his life, reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube. Shortly after the suicide attempt, Governor Desha issued a pardon for his son.|$|E
5|$|Gov. Schwarzenegger again {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, looking to {{overturn}} the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> at this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court accepted this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. Analysts believe that because the Court agreed to hear this case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. Just a week prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which some analysts felt would reflect the Court's position to likely overturn the violent video game law.|$|E
