40|$|The rocky {{intertidal}} zone {{has the potential}} to be one of the harshest environments for free-spawning organisms, but empirical data on fertilization success are scarce. Here, I report on an intertidal, solitary ascidian, Pyura stolonifera, which was observed to spawn at low tide. At a scale likely to be most important to gametes (metres, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>tide),</b> approximately 30 % of individuals in the population were spawning synchronously. Spawned gametes remained in a viscous matrix and this appeared to minimise their dilution. Fertilization success varied greatly among individuals (0 to 92 %) and was related to the distance to the nearest neighbouring spawner. Occasional wave wash facilitated the movement of sperm between spawners. Fertilization success in some individuals was limited by the scarcity of sperm whilst the experimental addition of sperm did not increase success in others...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBeach ridges in {{macrotidal}} environments experience strong multi-annual to multi-decennial ﬂuctuations of tidal inundation. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>tide</b> ﬂooding directly {{controls the}} duration of sediment reworking by waves, and thus the ridge dynamics. Flume modelling was used to investigate the impact of low-frequency tidal cycles on beach ridge evolution and internal architecture. The experiment was performed using natural bioclastic sediment, constant wave parameters and low-frequency variations of the mean water level. The morphological response of the beach ridge to water level ﬂuctuations and the preservation of sedimentary structures were monitored by using side-view and plan-view photographs. Results were compared with the internal architecture of modern bioclastic beach ridges in a macrotidal chenier plain (Mont St. Michel Bay, France) surveyed with ground-penetrating radar. The experimentally obtained morphologies and internal structures matched those observed in the ﬁeld, and the three ridge development stages identiﬁed in ground-penetrating radar proﬁles (early transgressive, late transgressive and progradational) were modelled successfully. Flume experiments indicate that ﬂat bioclastic shapes {{play a key role}} in sediment sorting in the breaker zone, and in sediment layering in the beach and washover fans. Water level controls washover geometry, beach ridge evolution and internal structure. Low water levels allow beach ridge stabilization and sediment accumulation lower on tidal ﬂats. During subsequent water level rise, accumulated sediment becomes available for deposition of new washover units and for bayward extension of the beach ridges. In the ﬁeld, low-frequency water level ﬂuctuations are related to the 4 4 year and 18 6 year tidal cycles. Experimental results suggest that these cycles may represent the underlying factor in the evolution of the macrotidal chenier coast at the multi-decadal to centennial time scale...|$|E

40|$|Flood/ebb tidal {{dominance}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in estuarine sediment transport. The Dyfi Estuary, mid-Wales, UK, is used as a case study, together with an idealized trumpet-shaped estuary morphology, to illustrate key processes giving rise to flood/ebb dominance. Observations made in the main entrance channel to the Dyfi indicate that the system is presently ebb-dominant with regard to both the relatively long <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the ebb <b>tide</b> and also the faster ebb velocities. Predictions made across the mouth of the estuary using the Telemac Modelling System suggest further that the net sand transport presently occurs out of the estuary. In contrast, due to the varying distribution of channels and flats within the estuary, the tidal flow in the upper estuary is flood-asymmetric and here the net transport is up-estuary. Flood versus ebb dominance is shown to be attributable to the relative extent of the channels and sandflats in relation to the mean water level. An attempt is made to develop a simple metric to determine present-day transport pathways within an estuary in response to its cross-channel flow asymmetrie...|$|R

Samples were collected at 13 sites and water temperature and salinity were measured using a CTD. Field surveys were twice: the first between August 5 - 7, the second between August 22 - 24. The cell density of G. polygramma was 6, 500 - 10, 000 cells ml- 1 during the 1 st survey, whereas during the 2 nd survey the range of the cells was recorded from 8, 000 to 12, 500 cells ml- 1. Cochlodinium polykrikoides ranged from 0 to 105 cells l- 1 during the field survey. In water environments, the majority stations during the 1 st survey showed a nearly homogeneous water column below 1 oC in temperature, as well as similar profiles of salinity. However, the stratification between the surface and bottom was observed in the 2 nd survey. Regarding nutrients, Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) in the surface ranged from 0. 144 to 0. 236 mg l- 1 during the 1 st survey, and 0. 082 - 0. 228 mg l- 1 during the 2 nd survey. DIP (Dissolved Inorganic Phosphorus) did not show any difference in concentration between the 1 st and 2 nd survey. During August of 2009, the wind speed in the southern waters remained at around ≤ 2 m s- 1 for about 60 % of time, and there was very little precipitation during the month. Irradiance of ≥ 10 hr was shown in the late of August.

It is frequently exposed to temperatures that can induce the cellular stress response due to the tidal rhythm. Instead of acclimating mussels to common conditions in the laboratory for several weeks, we collected mussels from a site with mussel body temperature recordings (specimens’ thermal history) and immediately started experimentation by mimicking the tidal rhythm with different levels of heat stress over multiple low tides and with different recovery periods. By using individuals that were entrained to the tidal rhythm and by maintaining it, {{we were able to}} simulate natural conditions and control levels of thermal stress.

40|$|The rocky {{intertidal}} zone, experiencing fully {{marine and}} fully terrestrial conditions, {{has become increasingly}} investigated as a model ecosystem for studying the future implications of climate change. The barnacle, Balanus glandula, a common rocky intertidal inhabitant, {{plays an important role}} as a key prey item for many organisms. Low tide can be particularly challenging for barnacles as they are marine organisms subjected to the abiotic conditions of a terrestrial environment. The most stressful of these are increased temperature and decreased oxygen availability. This study aimed to investigate how low tide impacts the energy budget, specifically the digestion, of B. glandula. Barnacles are unable to feed at low tide however, if they were able to digest at low tide, they could maximize their energy intake by emptying their stomach to prepare to feed at the next high tide. However, digestion is a metabolically costly activity, which could make it less energetically favorable to digest when there’s less oxygen available. To test for an effect <b>of</b> low <b>tide</b> on digestion, barnacles were fed, and the time to first fecal production measured as a ‘baseline’. This was repeated, but barnacles were exposed to either a 16 ºC or 35 ºC low tide immediately after being fed. The change in digestion time was calculated by comparing these two times for each barnacle. It was found that regardless of temperature, barnacles delayed their digestion by about 50 - 60 minutes after exposure to a one hour low tide. To determine the energetic cost of digestion, the rate of oxygen consumption was compared between starved and digesting barnacles. I was unable to detect any evidence of elevated metabolic activity during digestion. Additional testing is needed to confirm these results as the barnacles may have not fed during the trial, thus had no food to digest. While it appears that increasing temperatures associated with climate change will have little impact on the digestion of barnacles at low tide, if climate change alters the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> low <b>tide,</b> there could be an energetic impact to barnacles due to the slowing of their metabolism as indicated by the delay in their digestion...|$|R

We used surface nets to collect plankton over several 14 -day periods, during which consecutive tows were made at night against the flooding current at stations in the inlet channels. During these sampling periods, additional intensive periods of around-the-clock sur-face and near-bottom (using a bottom sled) plankton tows were made. Data on oceanographic conditions were obtained from moored instrument arrays and shipboard sampling. We identified three key factors that influenced the densities of post-larval white shrimp {{in time and space}} within the Ossabaw inlet system. The first factor was a critical minimum temperature of coastal waters of 27 – 28 C. Once the threshold tem-perature was reached, lunar tidal stage became a key factor when the full <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the flood <b>tide</b> coincided with darkness during peak ingress. This peak also coincided with an increase in water level within the system by more than 0. 2 m, which induced an addi-tional influx of water that reinforces the flood current over the ingress period. Our results suggest that the direction of subtidal currents (into or out of the system) becomes a significant factor in post-larval ingress when influx of water coincides with the time of favorable temperature conditions and nighttime flood tides...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} <b>of</b> <b>tide</b> {{and river}} flow is complicated {{due to the}} fact that <b>tide</b> consist <b>of</b> many constituents which interact differently with river flow. The river flow damps the tide from the river mouth and raises the mean water level. This report show that water levels in estuaries are the superposition of periodic tidal components and mean water levels. When the tidal components are filtered out, the mean water levels can correlate well with freshwater discharges and form rating curves of the estuaries. Chapter 1 describes tide and tidal current in the sea and gulf which serve as boundary conditions at river mouths. Chapter 2 applies harmonic analysis to 5 recording water level data of the Chao Phraya river and found that each constituent <b>of</b> <b>tide</b> damps exponentially along the river and the mean water level shows a linear distribution along the river. The complicated interaction of river flow with various constitutents <b>of</b> <b>tide</b> is simplified to its interaction with individual constituents. An analytical model <b>of</b> <b>tide</b> and river flow interaction is then developed using perturbation method in decomposing the steady state component of the river flow from the unsteady component <b>of</b> the <b>tide.</b> The analytical solutions can describe the interaction <b>of</b> <b>tide</b> and river flow completely. Chapter 3 attempts to analyse interaction <b>of</b> <b>tide</b> and river flow in the estuarine network of the Mekong river delta which is further complicated by branching of flow. The branching of flow can be determined from the continuity of flow and water level at the branching. Once the flow in each branch is determined, the interaction <b>of</b> <b>tide</b> and river flow in each branch is similar to that of Chapter 2.

40|$|THE THESIS This thesis {{describes}} {{the investigation of}} an estuarine front, the 'tidal-intrusion front, which was initially found in the Seiont estuary, North Wales but has subsequently been observed at other locations. In the Seiont, the front forms after low water, moves a considerable distance into the estuary to an upstream limit, retreats from the estuary and finally weakens, all within the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the flooding <b>tide.</b> It separates mixed from stratified regimes and is characterised by its surface appearance; inside the estuary, the front is 'V'-shaped with its apex directed towards the estuary head. Associated convergent flows include collection of all surface buoyant material {{at the apex of}} the V. Following a considerable field investigation of the front in the Seiont, two short periods were spent studying a similar feature in Loch Creran, Scotland. In the process of investigating other sites to determine the range of estuarine parameters appropriate to a stable tidal-intrusion front, an alternative estuarine convergence was discovered in the Conwy estuary, North Wales. The Conwy shows similar frontal behaviour to the Seiont during {{the early part of the}} flood tidal phase, but increased flood currents subsequently break down stratification producing an estuary of the 'well-mixed' class. 5 Throughout the remainder <b>of</b> the flood <b>tide</b> an axial line of debris forms along a substantial proportion of the estuary length. The persistence of the line indicates a secondary circulation which includes surface convergence towards the estuary axis. However, the line disperses at high water and no similar system is apparent during the ebb. The specific aims of the thesis may be summarised with respect to: a) the tidal-intrusion or T. I. front; i) to understand the parameters which govern the movements of the front. ii) to explain and/or reproduce by modelling, the three-dimensional aspects of the 'V'-shaped frontal boundary. b) the axial convergence or A. C. i) to detrmine the nature of the secondary circulation in the Conwy i. e. the pattern of cross-sectional secondary velocities. ii) to determine a mechanism which accounts for both the production of a sustained secondary circulation and its existence only during the flood phase <b>of</b> the <b>tide.</b> and finally, we attempt to define the stable parameter ranges for both types of convergence...|$|R

Tamura et al (1986) used the OBTM data of JMA (Isozaki et al., 1980) and pointed to a seasonal variation of the M 2 constituent, without detailed discussions. Blanton et al (2004) used sea level and OBP data, and noted a seasonal variation of the M 2 constituent of the sea level, but hardly described the seasonal variation <b>of</b> the OBP <b>tide</b> because <b>of</b> the short <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the observations. Although the effects of stratification (Kang et al., 2002) and tide-surge interaction (e.g., Pugh, 1987; Leeuwenburgh et al., 1999; Bernier and Thompson, 2007) have been suggested as causes of the seasonal variation <b>of</b> ocean <b>tides</b> in coastal regions, critical mechanisms have not yet been proposed (Woodworth, 2010). Although, investigating the mechanism of the seasonal modulation <b>of</b> ocean <b>tides</b> {{is beyond the scope of}} the present study, we assume that the seasonal variations <b>of</b> the OBP <b>tide</b> should be observed ubiquitously and their detectability is regarded as a measure of the quality of the OBP data at the tidal frequency bands.|$|R
40|$|Mortality factors {{most likely}} to {{constitute}} substantial selective pressures for early juvenile gastropods on temperate rocky shores were identified by examining the vulnerability of hatchlings of an intertidal snail, Nucella emarginata, to heat stress, desiccation, and predation in 1992 and 1993. The highest temperature of substrata measured at tidal heights colonized by N. emarginata in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada, was 28. 5 °C. This temperature was not lethal to hatchlings in laboratory tests. In laboratory and field desiccation experiments, all hatchlings died within 6 h of emersion. Early juveniles could not survive direct exposure to even moderate drying conditions for the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> a low <b>tide.</b> Hence, intertidal microhabitats which dry up even for short periods during low tides would prove lethal. Of 45 intertidal animal species to which hatchlings were exposed in the laboratory, small decapod crustaceans were the only organisms to cause substantial hatchling mortality. Of these, Pagurus hirsutiusculus and Hemigrapsus nudus were {{by far the most}} abundant in the field, and are probably the only important predators of early juvenile N. emarginata at most sites. Total predator densities in the field were as high as 438 individuals m - 2, suggesting that predation pressure may be intense. Desiccation and predation by decapod crustaceans appear to be the most significant threats to early juvenile N. emarginata. These factors commonly occur on most temperate rocky shores and undoubtedly constitute major selective agents influencing population parameters and shaping life-history strategies and early juvenile traits of intertidal invertebrates...|$|R
