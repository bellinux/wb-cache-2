25|$|The curtain rises on a girl's bedroom. The Young Girl {{comes into}} the room dressed in a white bonnet and ball gown. She has {{returned}} to her home after her first ball.

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé writing the {{sequence}} 9-4-8-1 and B'Day on the mirror with her lipstick. As the song begins, she briefly dances {{in a silver}} dress around a red room and later answers a telephone on a black couch. She, Solange, Rowland and Williams then walk across a multi-colored room to a black door where they all pose for the camera. As the chorus begins, Beyoncé, Solange, Rowland and Williams step out of a black limousine; they are all sporting matching silver dresses. They execute some dance steps as they walk inside, where people are partying. As the chorus ends, the song is paused while Beyoncé enters a room, where everyone begin to ask who she is, before she answers, [...] "It's B!" [...] and snaps <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> start back the music.|$|E

2500|$|Line 5 {{mentions}} jacks, {{which are}} the plucking mechanisms on the harpsichord. The jacks [...] "nimble leap" [...] which is both representative of the music being played {{and the men who}} are trying to show off to win the love interest's attention. Davis explains Shakespeare often uses the word [...] "Jack" [...] as a reference to ordinary other men but in this case it can have a double meaning of both the technology of the instrument and the woman's other male suitors. Line 13 also provides reference to [...] "saucy jacks" [...] which implies that the jacks are a rather impure and impudent lot. There is also a strong sexual innuendo where the word [...] "jacks" [...] makes a reference to fellatio. Shakespeare asserts that this woman can lend <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> these vulgar men but would much prefer her lips and her loving affections.|$|E
2500|$|... is a century-old witch {{who lives}} in the human world. She serves as Ruby's {{guardian}} and the main antagonist in the story involving the Witch's Knoll. She bears a great contempt for humans because they expanded into her territory. When land developers announce plans to turn her field into a garbage dump, she raises monster plants to attack tourists and then sets her army of plants to destroy the city. Like Ruby, her magic revolves around ravens and flora, the latter of which she can extend vines from <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> use as a weapon. She can also permanently merge with living creatures and acquire their powers. She is defeated when her magic object spellbook is destroyed, and as she dies she experiences a delusion where she is forgiven and rejoined by Ruby; in the anime, she is already dead but causes Ruby to have a delusion where she is receiving orders from her. Oyakata is voiced by Toshiko Maeda in the Japanese anime.|$|E
