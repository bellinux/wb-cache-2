40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> region in economy-based {{assessments}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government. Both economic perception and outlook have strong effects on <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal government, the President, and Congress. Furthermore, economic concerns are different across regions, and vary over time. Prospective <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy differ based on region, more than retrospective <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy. These {{findings suggest that}} {{people across the country}} react differently to <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national economy, and that region is an important aspect of government approval. Though more research will be necessary to explain why regional variation across economic <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government exist, this paper highlights <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> region within government evaluations and suggests some implications of it...|$|R

The remaining applicant cities—Havana, Istanbul, Leipzig and Rio de Janeiro—were eliminated. Four of the five candidate cities were prominent national capitals, which lent an increased competitive interest to the final bidding phase. Paris and Madrid earned the top scores during the application phase, but in early 2005, a more thorough <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> candidates put Paris and London in a close race that became tighter as the final vote approached. On 6 July 2005, in a four-round exhaustive ballot of the IOC (gathered at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore), Moscow, New York City and Madrid were eliminated {{in the first three}} rounds. London won the final round by a margin of four votes over Paris and secured the right to host the 2012 Olympics.|$|E
