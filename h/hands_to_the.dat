5|$|The film {{required}} {{large and}} ambitious sets to be constructed, from the Shaft of <b>Hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rambling, distorted Goblin City where the film's climactic battle takes place. The Shaft of Hands sequence was filmed on a rig that was roughly forty feet high, and required {{nearly a hundred}} performers to operate the grey, scaly hands integral to the scene. Connelly was strapped into a harness when shooting the scene, and would spend time between takes suspended midway up the shaft.|$|E
5|$|After the break, Morris added 37 runs in 14 {{minutes from}} a series of Compton full tosses and long hops, while Bradman had only added three. This {{prompted}} Yardley to take the new ball. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Ken Cranston, but sliced it in the air to point. Yardley dived and got his <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were then taken, and Morris had to farm the strike until Bradman's pain had subsided. Australia then reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E

5|$|The onslaught {{prompted}} Yardley to {{take the}} new ball and replace Compton with his pacemen. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Cranston's bowling, but sliced {{it in the air}} to point. Yardley dived forward and got his <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ball, but failed to hold on.

Drinks were taken while Bradman was being treated, and Morris had to shield his captain from the strike until the pain had subsided.

5|$|White {{published}} {{her first}} short story {{when she was}} 13. Her first major project was The Mysticism of William Blake, {{a modified version of}} her dissertation. It was published in 1927 by the University of Wisconsin Press. She later wrote six novels, including A Watch in the Night (1933), Not Built with <b>Hands,</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> End of the World, and Dust on a King's Highway. The Wisconsin State Journal wrote that her novels were highly praised for their historical settings, views towards religion, and contemplative psychology. White also authored Tudor Books of Private Devotion, English Devotional Literature, 1600–1640, Victorian Prose, The Metaphysical Poets (1935), Social Criticism in Popular Religious Literature of the Sixteenth Century, and numerous articles. Her religious works stemmed from her Roman Catholic reverence. White described her publishers as kind for publishing her unpopular scholarly works in-between her profitable novels.|$|E
5|$|After the Mamluk defeat by the Ottoman army under Sultan Selim I in the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516, Damascus and {{the citadel}} {{surrendered}} peacefully to the Ottomans. Damascus {{was given to}} Janbirdi al-Ghazali, a Mamluk who had submitted to Selim I. When Selim I died in 1520, al-Ghazali revolted and took the citadel. He marched upon Aleppo to expand his realm, but had to retreat and was eventually defeated and killed {{in the vicinity of}} Damascus in 1521. Damascus again changed <b>hands,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans. From 1658 onward, the citadel was controlled by the Janissaries—Ottoman infantry units. In 1738 and in 1746, they were involved in conflicts with the governors of Damascus; the Janissaries temporarily lost control of the citadel in 1746. The north gate of the citadel collapsed in 1752, and sustained heavy damage due to a severe earthquake in 1759. According to contemporary accounts, both the western and southern walls collapsed, but the damage was quickly repaired in 1761.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{then headed}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes {{returned}} from injury, so Hassett {{returned to his}} customary position in the middle order. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Lindwall's 6/20, the tourists skittled Yardley’s men for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon. With the score at 1/10, Bill Edrich attempted to hook a short ball from Bill Johnston. Edrich failed {{to get the ball}} {{in the middle of the}} bat and it looped up and travelled around 10m. Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, diving sideways to get two <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ball. Soon after, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge that appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon. However, the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was too busy watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who waited for Compton to regain his bat and composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out. However, Compton only made four before being dismissed, so Australia lost little from Hassett's sportsmanship.|$|E
5|$|During {{the lunch}} interval, heavy rain fell, {{before the sun}} began to dry the pitch, making the ball skid through upon England's {{resumption}} at 13/1. Miller beat Washbrook's bat twice in one over soon after the resumption, {{but was unable to}} extract an edge. Lindwall reached his peak speed and Edrich edged to first slip, where Ian Johnson got both <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ball above his head, but failed to hold on. Edrich was on four at the time and this was part of a 20-minute passage of play during which England was unable to score. The next ball from Lindwall, Washbrook was caught on the run by Brown on the fine leg boundary after attempting to hook a bouncer pitched on the line of leg stump. It was to be the first of several times that Washbrook was dismissed while hooking, attracting substantial criticism. Washbrook's fall left England at 15/2 after 41 minutes of batting and brought Compton to the crease to join Edrich. Compton square drove Miller to the boundary for four, which prompted a retaliatory bouncer and a negative crowd reaction. Edrich was not scoring quickly but he defied the bowling of Miller and Lindwall as the English pair took the score to 46. Likewise, Compton was restraining his natural inclination to attack in an attempt to rebuild the innings after the two early wickets. During this period Brown made a series of one-handed run-saving stops in the field. The rain had also softened up the pitch and as a result, the playing surface did not offer much bounce.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} an Aboriginal cricket team {{can be traced to}} cattle {{stations}} in the Western District of Victoria, where, in the mid-1860s, European pastoralists introduced Aboriginal station <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sport.

Several members of this team joined what would become the Aboriginal XI that toured England under the captaincy of Englishman Charles Lawrence.|$|E
25|$|First {{one should}} rinse hands with warm water, keeping hands below wrists and forearms, to prevent {{contaminated}} water from {{moving from the}} <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wrists and arms. The warm water helps to open pores, which helps with the removal of microorganisms, without removing skin oils. One should use five milliliters of liquid soap, to completely cover the hands, and rub wet, soapy hands together, outside the running water, for at least 20 seconds. The most commonly missed areas are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers, and under fingernails. Artificial nails and chipped nail polish harbor microorganisms.|$|E

Later the same year a large Williamite expeditionary force arrived in Belfast Lough landing and taking the major towns of the area before laying siege to Carrickfergus. Belfast was captured by a detachment led by Henry Wharton after the Jacobites had abandoned it without a fight.
