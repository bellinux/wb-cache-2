Emma said that the very first time she ever became aware of a polygamy revelation being attributed to Smith by Mormons was when she read about it in Orson Pratt's periodical The Seer in 1853. Emma campaigned publicly against polygamy, and was the main signatory of a petition in 1842, with a thousand female signatures, denying that Smith was connected with polygamy. As president of the Ladies' Relief Society, Emma authorized publishing a certificate in the same year denouncing polygamy, and denying her husband as its creator or participant. Even on her deathbed, Emma denied Joseph's involvement with polygamy, stating, [...] "No such thing as polygamy, or spiritual wifery, was taught, publicly or privately, before my husband's death, that I have now, or <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> knowledge of... He had no other wife but me; nor did he to my knowledge ever have".|$|E

When asked by a reporter why he chose to accept the Green Bay job, Sherman responded: [...] "There is absolutely no other college job I would have left Texas A for and only one professional job that I've <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> interest in and that being the Green Bay Packers.

After Packers head coach Mike Holmgren resigned to accept the Seattle Seahawks head coach position, Holmgren hired Sherman to become the offensive coordinator for the 1999 season.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{earliest}} stages of World War I, with Romania still cautiously neutral, Bianu {{also took a}} neutralist attitude. Historian Nicolae Iorga, who {{was president of the}} Cultural League, noted that Bianu, unlike Sturdza, did not wish to see Romania committed to the Central Powers. This was because [...] "he resented us fighting alongside the Hungarians, who never <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> other objective but to crush us." [...] However, Bianu {{was also one of the}} Transylvanians and minority-PNL members who also rejected proposals to join the Entente Powers. Among these [...] "Germanophiles", Bianu stood out for speaking out against the project to occupy Transylvania from Austria-Hungary with Entente support. In August 1914, using the pen name Ion Frunză, he published the essay Pentru lămurirea situației. Cuvinte către români ("Making Things Clear. An Address to the Romanians"). This work, soon after translated into German, argued that the Entente was a cover for the Russian Empire, Pan-Slavism, and the [...] "Turanic hordes"; he decried the persecution of Romanians in Austria-Hungary, but noted that they all fared much better than the Romanians living in Russia's Bessarabia Governorate. This view was instantly supported by the sociologist Dimitrie Gusti, who suggested that [...] "Frunză's admirable work" [...] should be published [...] "in millions of copies, so that every Romanian will read it".|$|E
2500|$|John William Weber {{says that}} [...] "personal conflict" [...] {{was the cause}} of some of the violence. Weber says the [...] "most {{important}} example" [...] was that of Aniceto Pizana, the owner of Los Tulitos Ranch. Pizana's neighbor, Jeff Scrivener, was known for wanting Pizana's land so in early August he told American authorities that Pizana was in league with the rebels and had harbored some of them during one of their raids. Despite this accusation, no evidence suggests that Pizana <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> significant ties with the rebels, though he was a friend of Luis de la Rosca, a known raider who owned a store in Rio Hondo. In response to Scrivener's claim, a force of about thirty Texas Rangers, United States Army soldiers, and some deputy sheriffs attacked the Los Tulitos Ranch on August 3. During the gunfight that followed, one soldier was killed, and three other people were wounded, including two deputy sheriffs and Pizana's son. Pizana himself got away and according to Weber he joined up with Luis de la Rosca after the attack on his ranch. From then on Rosca and Pizana became the [...] "primary military leaders of the Plan [...]" [...] On August 6, Luis de la Rosca led a raid on the town of Sebastian, killing A. L. Austin and his son Charles. Austin formerly served {{as the president of the}} Law and Order League which, according to federal investigators, [...] "had driven several bad men out of that section [...] " [...] and was therefore an ideal target for the raiders who thought of him as a racist. Within the next few days after the deaths of the Austins, several local Mexicans were killed by either the Texas Rangers or vigilantes. A posse led by the Texas adjudant general, Henry Hutchings, and Captain Ransom killed three people alone. Meanwhile, the rebels were destroying railroad property by ripping up tracks, burning bridges and attacking the repairmen who were sent to fix the problems.|$|E
