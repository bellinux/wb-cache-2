Generally, those motors are driven by semiconductor inverters and currents fed to the armature windings contain high harmonics. Therefore, the bulks are exposed to high harmonics magnetic fields and AC losses are produced in the bulks. The AC losses deteriorate {{the efficiency of the}} motors and cause temperature rise of the bulks which decrease the trapped magnetic fluxes of the bulks. Usually, <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> devices are inserted between the bulks and armature windings. However, the shielding devices degrade compactness of the motors. Therefore, {{it is important to have}} knowledge of the influence of the high harmonics magnetic fields on the AC losses and trapped magnetic fluxes of the bulk for optimum design of the shielding devices. In this work, the authors experimentally study the influence of high harmonics magnetic fields...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In microfluidics, {{electric}} {{fields are}} widely used to assist the generation and the manipulation of droplets or jets. However, uncontrolled electric field can disrupt the operation of an integrated microfluidic system, for instance, through undesired coalescence of droplets, undesired changes in the wettability of the channel wall or unexpected death of cells. Therefore, an approach to control the distribution of electric fields inside microfluidic channels is needed. Inspired by the <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> effect in electrical and radiation systems, we demonstrate the shielding of electric fields by incorporating 3 D metallic coils in microfluidic devices. Using the degree of coalescence of emulsion drops as an indicator, we have shown that electric fields decrease dramatically in micro-channels surrounded by these conductive metallic coils both experimentally and numerically. Our work illustrates an approach to distribute electric fields in integrated microfluidic networks by selectively installing metallic coils or electrodes, and represents a significant step towards large-scale electro-microfluidic systems...|$|E
40|$|Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) {{has been}} a leading rapid {{prototyping}} process {{but it has been}} mostly limited to use in making prototypes for design verification and functional testing applications. The commercial process can currently fabricate parts only in limited types of thermoplastics such as ABS and Polycarbonate. Very little efforts have been made to increase the range of FDM materials to include metals or metal based composites for wider application domain beyond just design and verification. This thesis presents new research in this direction by developing novel metal based composites for use in FDM technology. The principal objective of this research is to develop new metal/polymer composite materials for direct use in the current Fused Deposition Modelling rapid prototyping platform with long term aim of developing direct rapid tooling on the FDM system. Using such composites, the direct rapid tooling will allow fabrication of injection moulding dies and inserts with desired thermal and mechanical properties suitable for using directly in injection moulding machines for short term or long term production runs. The new metal/polymer composite material developed in this research work involves use of iron particles and copper particles in a polymer matrix of ABS material, which offers much improved thermal, electrical and mechanical properties enabling current Fused Deposition Modelling technique to produce rapid functional parts and tooling. Higher thermal conductivity of the new metal/polymer composite material coupled with implementation of conformal cooling channels enabled by layer-by layer fabrication technology of the Fused Deposition Modelling will result in tremendously improved injection cycles times, and thereby reducing the cost and lead time of injection moulding tooling. Due to highly metal-particulate filled matrix of the new composite material, injection tools and inserts made using this material on Fused Deposition Modelling, demonstrate a higher stiffness comparing to those made out of pure polymeric material resulting in withstanding higher injection moulding pressures. Moreover, metallic filler content of the new composite allows processing of functional parts with electrical conductivity and in case of using ferromagnetic fillers, namely as fine iron powders, it introduces magnetic properties, which will make FDM-built components suitable for electronic applications specifically whereby <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>shielding</b> is of high interest. In this research project, a full characterization of the newly developed metal/polymer composites including rheological, thermal, mechanical and electrical properties has been investigated. Mathematical models have been employed in order to predict and optimize the viscous behaviour of metal/polymer composite during the course of deposition through the FDM nozzle. In order to predict the main flow parameters of the metal/polymer composites including pressure, temperature, and velocity fields through the FDM liquefier head, 2 -D and 3 -D numerical analysis of melt flow behaviour of acrylonitrile- butadiene-styrene (ABS) and Iron composite as a representative metal/polymer material has been carried out using ANSYS FLOTRAN and ANSYS CFX commercial codes. Results of numerical analysis have been verified by the developed empirical mathematical models. A variety of advanced techniques have been employed to fully characterize the newly developed metal/polymer composites in order to successfully process filaments for fabrication of injection mould tooling inserts. Morphological effects of metallic fillers and surfactants as well as variation of volume fractions of constituents on the viscoelastic properties of the new composite material have also been investigated. Filaments of the filled ABS has been fabricated and characterized to verify the possibility of prototyping and direct tooling using the new material on the current FDM machine. Major contributions of the thesis include: • Development of a new metal/polymer composite material for functional parts and rapid tooling solutions on Fused Deposition Modeling platform. • Development of mathematical models for predicting viscous behavior of three-component composite flow through capillary extrusion process. • Full rheological, thermal, mechanical and electrical characterization of the new metal/polymer composites. • Combining experimental and numerical methodology (tools) to predict melt flow behavior of metal/polymer composite through Fused Deposition Modeling. • Fabrication of stiff and flexible filaments of the metal-polymer composites as feedstock material for direct rapid tooling via Fused Deposition Modeling. • Fabrication of functional parts and inserts of new metal/polymer composites successfully and directly on the FDM 3000 system. • Production of plastic parts using injection moulding tools made by Direct FDM-based Rapid Tooling Process...|$|E

In this study, a brittle epoxy {{polymer resin}} has {{successfully}} been toughened and strengthened by very small concentrations of diamond and SiC nanoparticles {{as well as}} Nanodiamonds (collectively called "nanoparticles" here). The tensile stress-strain response (based on the ASTM tensile tests for polymers) and the fracture energy release rate, GIC, (based on the ASTM Single-Edge-Notched-Bending, SENB, tests for polymers) of neat and nano-reinforced epoxy polymer were characterized over a range of "nanoparticle" concentrations. In addition to the large-scale improvements in mechanical properties, the nanoresins developed in this work also showed other superior multifunctional performances such as structural damping and acoustic properties. In the later part of this study, horizontally (in-plane, i. e., completely parallel to the surface) aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT with diameters of less than 100 nm) nanocarpet-nanotapes are developed as reinforcements to enhance the overall performance of resins, adhesives, and composites, globally (when it is interleaved within the composites to cover or "carpet" the entire surface of the parts) or locally (when {{it is used to}} locally reinforce the locations of joints, cut-outs, holes, etc, where stress concentrations exist). In addition to large scale improvements in mechanical properties, the nanocomposites developed in this work also showed enhanced multifunctional performance such as damping, <b>electro-magnetic</b> interference <b>shielding</b> (EMI), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and Thermal Conductivity. Finally, we report the use of chemically modified vertically aligned carbon nanotube nanoforest nanofilm directly assembled on carbon paper as Gas Diffusion Layers (GDLs) for fuel cells. GDLs enhance the delivery of gases to the catalyst layers by controlling the water in the pore channels while simultaneously completing the electrical and electronic circuits needed to deliver the power generated by the Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cells. Current carbon paper products for the GDLs offer limited hydrophobic characteristics which are often enhanced by a Teflon® PTFE coating on the surfaces of the carbon paper. Our invention substantially improves both the hydrophobic nature of the carbon paper and its porosity in the fuel cell as well as enhances the electrical conductivity and the electron/proton conduction. While the GDLs prepared by current technology have major performance losses at elevated temperatures and low humidities, our modified GDL based on the nanoforest nanofilm carbon paper technology, developed in this work, shows no performance loss when operated at elevated temperatures with lower humidity conditions in additon to the enhancement in peak power density...|$|R

Angelis†, Jan van Eijk†‡ Abstract — Next generation charged particle lithography and microscopy require scanning stages with extremely high accu-racy’s, which {{have to operate}} in high vacuum and of which the produced stray magnetic field is very small. Philips CFT started a research project {{to find a solution}} to these challenges and developed a demonstrator that addresses all the above-mentioned demands. A solution has been found in using a combination of electro-magnetic actuators, magnetic bearings and magnetic <b>shields.</b> <b>Electro-magnetic</b> actuators and bearings have excellent prop-erties to achieve nanometer accuracy in closed loop control. However, the demands with respect to the magnetic stray field seem totally in conflict with this concept. A main point in the project was to find an effective and practical shielding to overcome that problem. The developed demonstrator showed peak servo errors during scan of 3 [nm], while the servo errors for stage rotations were no more than 0. 1 [µrad]. Three dimensional magnetic finite element calculations have indicated {{that it is possible to}} shield the actuators in such a way that the requirement of 1 [mGauss] at wafer level can be reached. Tests have proven that these calculations are reliable. Though the prototype system is not designed for vacuum compatibility, the concept is such that vacuum compatibility can be achieved comparably easy. The paper will elaborate on the different components of this system...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by marine mussel adhesives, the {{dopamine}} (DA) polymerization {{process has}} been introduced as a versatile deposition method to coat almost all kinds of material surfaces and form a nanoscale polydopamine (PDA) thin film. Although the DA polymerization mechanism and the PDA structure have not been fully explored, PDA films have gained great interest for their promising applications, such as anti-corrosion coating, drug delivery, biosensing and nanocomposite functionalization. In this project, we started with the fundamental investigations of the surface, adhesion, friction and cracking properties of PDA thin films. A series of surface characterizations and mechanical tests were performed to reveal the static and dynamic properties of PDA films coated on glass, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and epoxy substrates in {{both dry and wet}} conditions. The systematic studies of the PDA film provide insights into its stability, mechanical and adhesive properties; further investigations are focused on the effective transferring of this nano-material to functional devices and biocompatible coatings. To achieve this goal, we combined PDA with polypyrrole (PPy), {{which is one of the}} most extensively investigated electrically conductive polymers because of its economic preparation, long-term stability and good biocompatiablity. After being functionalized by PDA, the PPy morphology changed from globular to fibrous; the adhesion between PPy film and glass substrates was enhanced due to the PDA self-adhesion property and the use of proper DA/pyrrole (Py) ratios also improved PPy conductivity. All of these new features significantly improve PPy processability and broaden its potential applications. In order to understand the effect of DA on Py polymerization, we performed a detailed and systematic investigation using three types of bioinspired catechol derivatives simple catechol (CA), L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in addition to the dopamine and 2 -pheny-lethylamine (PA) in the synthesis of PPy. These studies provided strong evidence that catechol modification can be applied as a general protocol to functionalize conducting polymers to overcome their poor water dispersibility and low interfacial adhesion of PPy. Although DA-PPy has shown promise in many biological applications, its conductivity still requires further improvement, especially at higher DA/Py mole ratios. As a result, we developed new synthetic approaches to the preparation of DA-PPy nanostructures, which have both improved electrical conductivity and water dispersibility. Moreover, we explored the suitable application of each as-fabricated nanomaterials depending on the DA/Py reacting mole ratio. In particular, DA-PPy produced using a 0. 032 DA/Py mole ratio demonstrated superior capacitance for supercapacitors, DA-PPy obtained from a 0. 064 DA/Py mole ratio can be used as co-fillers in the epoxy network to prepare functional composites for electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs), DA-PPy synthesized from a 0. 64 DA/Py mole ratio was found to have the impressive capability of absorbing electromagnetic microwaves for <b>electro-magnetic</b> interference (EMI) <b>shielding</b> applications. Due to the synergetic effect of DA modification, conducting polymer DA-PPy exhibit multifunctional and unique properties, which opens a brand new field of nanomaterial syntheses and applications...|$|R
