40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This thesis is concerned with a 3 -phase multistage high frequency link DC to AC power conversion with a novel inverter-cycloconverter circuitry. The conversion system is composed of a high frequency PWM inverter, step-up high frequency transformer and cycloconverter with bidirectional switching devices. In first stage the DC voltage of the power source, say a submarine battery, is inverted {{to a system of}} 3 -phase sinusoidally modulated I kHz alternative wave forms. For this purpose a suggested optimized PWM technique for 3 -phase inverter operation is adopted, in which harmonic components up to 17 th (17 kHz) are eliminated from the inverter output voltages. In the second stage, for DC <b>input</b> <b>isolation</b> from AC output and also for a voltage transformation (here stepping-up) a high frequency (size reduced) transformer is employed. Generalized high frequency operation, influence and side effects of the transformer on overall system design & performance is investigated. In the final stage the 1 kHz -to- 50 Hz conversion process is accomplished by a 3 -phase cycloconverter. The proposed "nonlinear modulation strategy" for cycloconverter output voltage and associated harmonic analysis is demonstrated, in which the harmonic components up to 38 th (1. 9 kHz) are eliminated from the conversion system output voltage. To assess the suggested functioning principles for the inverter & cycloconverter, the prototype conversion system was developed. Some design criteria and switching device selection are presented, together with different voltage & current wave forms of the prototype system under resistive & inductive load (induction motor) and their respective spectra...|$|E
30|$|In recent years, with rapid {{advances}} in microprocessors and power electronics devices, {{many studies have}} been realized {{in order to improve}} performance of transformers. A new transformer was proposed by McMurray (1970). These transformers were called as electronic power transformer (EPT) or solid state transformer (SST). The main feature of these transformers is having ability to perform the same tasks with conventional transformers. Besides, EPTs possess many advantages over conventional transformers such as voltage sag and swell compensations, fixed AC output voltage, instantaneous voltage regulation, power factor correction, reactive power compensation, harmonic isolation and all of these advantages can be realized on a single circuit (Bifaretti et al. 2011; Dujic et al. 2013; Kang et al. 1999; Kececioglu et al. 2016; Grider et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2014; Acikgoz and Sekkeli 2014; Zhao et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2015). Many studies which focus on design and control of EPT structures have been realized by many researchers and institutes in the literature. In generally, two approaches were proposed for EPT structure; with DC-link and without DC-link (Falcones et al. 2010). EPT structure with DC-link consisting <b>input,</b> <b>isolation</b> and output stages has several key features such as reactive power and voltage sag/swell compensations (Yang et al. 2015; Lai et al. 2005). Pulse width modulation (PWM) rectifiers are widely used at input stage of these EPT structures to convert AC voltage into DC voltage because of their good dynamic response, unity power factor and regulated DC bus voltage. Isolation stage has DC–DC converter and high frequency (HF) transformer, and output stage has single or three-phase inverter which generates the desired output voltage and power (Falcones et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2015; Hwang et al. 2013).|$|E
30|$|EPT {{structure}} {{which has}} many superior {{features such as}} high power factor, voltage sag/swell compensation, multi-functionality, excellent power quality compared with conventional transformer is proposed in this study. EPT structure {{in this study is}} composed of <b>input,</b> <b>isolation</b> and output stages. Three-phase PWM rectifier at the input stage is not only used in order to convert AC to the constant DC voltage, but also has reactive power compensation ability. PI controllers are generally used in PWM rectifiers due to their simple structures. However, PI controller needs mathematical model of the system to be controlled and has undesirable characteristics such as slow response, large overshoots and oscillation. To cope with these problems, neuro-fuzzy controller that has nonlinear, robust structure and which does not require the mathematical model of the system to be controlled is preferred in this study. Dual active bridge converter at isolation stage is used for DC–DC conversion and is controlled by neuro-fuzzy controller in order to obtain constant DC bus voltage. Three-phase inverter that provides the desired power and voltage to load is located at the output stage. After designing of all stages, a number of simulation studies have been carried out in order to verify performance of EPT structure with the proposed controller under voltage harmonics, voltage flicker and voltage sag/swell conditions. The simulation results illustrate that EPT structure with the neuro-fuzzy controller provides more superior performance than PI controller with respect to rise time, settling time, overshoot, and power factor in all test conditions and is not sensitive these conditions and is capable of regulating output voltages and compensating disturbances in grid voltages. Moreover, proposed EPT provides fast and controllable AC/DC responses because of strong structure of the neuro fuzzy controller and thus, improves the stability of power system.|$|E

40|$|A {{trade-off}} between linearity {{and efficiency}} exists in conventional power amplifiers. The outphase amplifying concept overcomes this trade-off by enabling {{the use of}} high efficiency, non-linear power amplifiers for linear amplification. An amplitude modulated signal is first decomposed into two constant amplitude, phase modulated signals that can be amplified using two high efficiency switching power amplifiers. The two outputs are then recombined to restore the original amplitude modulated signal. In this manner, an outphase power amplifier can simultaneously achieve high efficiency and good linearity. This thesis investigates the capability of the outphase amplifying technique in modern wireless communication. First, a digital amplitude-to-phase conversion scheme is proposed to facilitate the outphase decomposition. By {{taking advantage of the}} available computational power in current digital technology, the amplitude-to-phase conversion can be implemented with both accuracy and efficiency in the digital domain. A proof-of-concept outphase power amplifier is fabricated using the IBM 7 WL SiGe BiCMOS process technology. (cont.) The test chip includes two class-E power amplifiers and the first 5. 8 GHz fully integrated Wilkinson power combiner. The low-loss integrated combiner allows efficient outphase recombining while providing the necessary <b>input</b> <b>isolation</b> for a robust outphase power amplifier. The outphase power amplifier achieves an efficiency of 47 % at the maximum output power of 18. 5 dBm. For an input Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signal of 32 sub-channels of 64 -QAM, the adjacent channel power leakage ratio (ACPR) is better than 32 dBc.

Several new antennas have been developed and assessed for their suitable application to RoF systems. The antennas were: (i) a multiband PIFA developed previously in the ROSETTE project and modified here to exhibit an improved match when integrated with a ground plane for ceiling mounting. (ii) A cost effective microstrip array directive antenna for street illumination in the Manhattan Scenario. Beam coverage was controlled by electronic shaping and mechanical tilting. (iii) A new compact PIFA design for use in mobile equipment or sectorized base stations where a slotted structure is used to achieve a sharp edge defined operating bandwidth which allows the antenna to act as a filter, thus reducing component count and insertion loss in the transceiver front end. The antenna has been integrated with a larger handset sized ground plane and its insensitivity to this mounting has been demonstrated. (iv) the antenna in (iii) has been implemented in a 3 sector cluster and interference between sector beams by pattern overlap has been characterized. (v) A new compact PIFA working in the 3 - 5 GHz sub-bands of the FCC UWB band has been described and demonstrated to offer useful performance and exhi bit a useful band pass fil tering characteristic reducing the need for a frontend filter in UW 8 systems.
