25|$|Often, when {{counting}} objects, {{one does}} not <b>keep</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> numerical label corresponds to which object: one only keeps track of the subgroup of objects which have already been labeled, {{so as to be}} able to identify unlabeled objects necessary for Step 2. However, if one is counting persons, then one can ask the persons who are being counted to each keep track of the number which the person's self has been assigned. After the count has finished it is possible to ask the group of persons to file up in a line, in order of increasing numerical label. What the persons would do during the process of lining up would be something like this: each pair of persons who are unsure of their positions in the line ask each other what their numbers are: the person whose number is smaller should stand on the left side and the one with the larger number {{on the right side of}} the other person. Thus, pairs of persons compare their numbers and their positions, and commute their positions as necessary, and through repetition of such conditional commutations they become ordered.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Seltmann and Chater {{were not}} {{planning}} {{for an international}} release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they [...] "were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed... We had no idea the record would get such a wide-scale release so we saw no need to <b>keep</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we were using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a 'No-one's {{going to listen to}} it anyway' sort of attitude." [...] The sources spanned many different styles of music and sampled artists include: Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster and Madonna. Seltmann felt that [...] "he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it's almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like 'Holiday' come up". He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as [...] "funny samples" [...] that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna's song [...] "'Holiday' was one of those where we put something together, ended it with 'Holiday' and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn't live without it so I guess we just had to make that one work". Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when trying to clear all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, [...] "he album is slightly different to its original form in that it had a whole new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away". The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. [...] "Electricity" [...] was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song [...] "still sounds good". In early 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album, using the pseudonym Bobbydazzler. It had received the official title, Since I Left You in March 2000.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Architectures of the {{language}} production system are usually subdivided into three processing modules, which are usually termed conceptualizer, formulator, and articulator (LEVELT 1989). Generally, these three subsystems compute specific representations as input for the next subsystem. Within the conceptualizer content selection, preparation, and linearization takes place. The linearized conceptual representation [...] -the "preverbal message", in LEVELT's terms [...] -is handed on to the formulator. Planning the preverbal message is crucially influenced by the speaker's beliefs <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the addressee beliefs, what their goals, plans, and intentions might be. Additional knowledge sources a speaker considers while planning the message are the spatial representation, the discourse protocol which <b>keeps</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> has been said, additional situative beliefs, and encyclopedic knowledge.

40|$|Instance {{segmentation}} is {{the problem}} of detecting and delineating each distinct object of interest appearing in an image. Current instance segmentation approaches consist of ensembles of modules that are trained independently of each other, thus missing opportunities for joint learning. Here we propose a new instance segmentation paradigm consisting in an end-to-end method that learns how to segment instances sequentially. The model is based on a recurrent neural network that sequentially finds objects and their segmentations one at a time. This net is provided with a spatial memory that <b>keeps</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> pixels have been explained and allows occlusion handling. In order to train the model we designed a principled loss function that accurately represents the properties of the instance segmentation problem.
