50|$|The AY-3-8910 generates tones with base {{frequencies}} {{of up to}} 125 kHz (4 MHz input clock, or 8 MHz with the YM2149F), well beyond human perception and into the ultrasonic range. This is not as wasteful as it may first appear, however, as it offers a finer frequency resolution than would otherwise be available under the <b>frequency-divider</b> scheme whilst only sacrificing {{a few of the}} total 4096 values; only dividers below 5 imply entirely-ultrasonic frequencies. Frequencies equivalent to the top octave of a piano keyboard can be defined with reasonable accuracy versus the accepted note values for even-tempered scale, to nearly 1 Hz precision in the A440 range, and even more finely at lower pitches. Despite the high maximum frequency, the ability to divide that figure by 4096 means the lowest directly definable output frequency is 30.6 Hz, roughly equal to B0, the third lowest note on a normal 88-key piano, and as good as subsonic with everyday speaker systems. In essence, the chip is able produce decently musical output at all reasonable pitches found in most compositions.|$|E
40|$|<b>Frequency-divider</b> circuit {{is a key}} {{building}} block of phase-locked-loop (PLL) and frequency synthesizer (FS) circuits, which are required for all data communication and telecommunication systems. However, the failure of <b>frequency-divider</b> circuits functioning at low-voltage high-frequency operation is a major bottleneck for low-voltage operations of PLL and FS circuits. This invention is a <b>frequency-divider</b> circuit that can operate on a very low voltage and {{at a very high}} frequency, which surpasses the existing techniques. The new <b>frequency-divider</b> circuit can generate output signals having a frequency half of the frequency of the input signal. The new technique when applied enables the <b>frequency-divider</b> circuit to work at a minimum supply voltage while operating effectively at multi-gigahertz frequency range. Experimental results have demonstrated that such a circuit can operate successfully at a frequency of more than 20 GHz with a 1 -V supply. Besides, it avoids the employment of advanced but expensive fabrication processes using alternative low-threshold devices. It is notable that such special processes are not ready for high-level system integration and low-threshold devices usually suffer from leakage-current and high power consumption problems. The current invention provides a cost-effective solution using standard fabrication technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of the digital/time converter (DTC) circuit in fractional-N phase-locked loops (PLLs) allows the realization of high-performance bang-bang digital PLLs suitable for wireless communications. In this paper, a general expression of the dynamic range required for the DTC is derived {{as a function of}} the order of the Delta-Sigma modulator driving the <b>frequency-divider</b> modulus. Based on this, it is shown how the combination of the DTC with the M-phase switching technique helps to relax the DTC dynamic range by a factor of M and reduce its nonlinearity. The effectiveness of the phase switching technique is demonstrated via behavioral-level simulation of a digital PLL in the case of first-, second-, and third-order Delta-Sigma modulator...|$|E
