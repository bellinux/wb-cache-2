40|$|Holiday travel {{experiences}} {{may have}} potential to increase post-travel subjective wellbeing (SWB). Although positive association between travel and individual’s SWB has been established, extant research on holiday travel is mostly conducted in Western contexts, and adolescents’ perspectives are under-represented. Moreover, factors the influence post-holiday SWB {{are not well}} established in the literature. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} study was to examine the influence of travel on Chinese adolescents’ SWB in <b>family</b> <b>holiday</b> travel contexts, and to explore the relationships among trip reflection, family functioning, and adolescent students’ post-holiday SWB. Indeed, the role travel experiences might play in buffering the negative influence of the intense academic pressures faced by many Chinese adolescentsis certainly warranted. Using the Chinese Labor Holiday and the National Holiday as experimental contexts, a longitudinal research design was employed. Surveys were distributed at two public middle schools in the urban area of a large-sized city located in the East part of Mainland China. Participants were middle school students aged between 12 to 15 years old (n= 943). The questionnaire assessed the construct of SWB (i. e., global life satisfaction, contentment with specific life domains, and affects) at three stages (before holidays, right after holidays, and one month after holidays) of each holiday respectively, and compared the changes of respondents’ SWB using a series of repeated measures of ANOVA where travel, holidays, and siblings were employed to conduct between group comparisons. Additionally, the questionnaire assessed the construct of trip reflection and family functioning during <b>family</b> <b>holidays</b> and tested the proposed conceptual framework using the structural equation modeling method. Results from the repeated measures of ANOVA suggested that Chinese adolescents’ SWB significantly changed across <b>family</b> <b>holidays,</b> where travel was an important factor that increased adolescent students’ SWB. In particular, adolescent travelers’ SWB level was significantly higher than non-travelers before and after holidays. Additionally, only those students’ who traveled during <b>family</b> <b>holidays</b> experienced a significant increase of SWB when they returned to school. However, increases in SWB were not sustained over time. The benefits of travel on travelers’ SWB diminished gradually after holidays. Results from SEM model revealed that family functioning significantly and positively predicted the results of adolescents’ post-holiday SWB. However, trip reflection did not significantly influence travelers’ post-holiday SWB. As well, this study found that adolescent travelers’ sex and the nature of <b>family</b> <b>holidays</b> influenced the relationship of family functioning and post-holiday SWB. Specifically, family functioning during <b>family</b> <b>holidays</b> had a greater influence on male adolescent travelers’ global life satisfaction, and a greater influence on female travelers’ contentment with specific life domains as well as emotional wellbeing. Moreover, both the Labor Holiday and the National Holiday had beneficial influence on adolescent travelers’ SWB. Indeed, shorter <b>family</b> <b>holidays</b> had greater influence on increasing adolescents’ positive affect and decreasing their negative affect, whereas longer <b>family</b> <b>holidays</b> were more helpful to enhance students’ contentment with family life, school life and leisure life. There are several implications of this study. Theoretically, this study advances our knowledge on the influence of <b>family</b> <b>holiday</b> travel on adolescents’ SWB. These results fill important contextual research gaps, by demonstrating the role of travel experiences on Chinese adolescents’ SWB. Moreover, relationships between trip reflection, family functioning and adolescent travelers’ post-holiday SWB are not yet explored as mechanisms that help explain post-travel SWB among Chinese adolescents. Practically, this research suggests schools to remove the pressure of studying during <b>family</b> <b>holidays</b> and encourage their students to take trips or participate in leisure activities during <b>family</b> <b>holidays.</b> When adolescent students return to school, schools should also encourage students’ participation in leisure activities to sustain the beneficial effects of <b>family</b> <b>holidays.</b> In addition, parents should not only pay attention to their children’s academic achievements, but also care about their wellbeing and quality of life. It is recommended that parents take advantage of <b>family</b> <b>holiday</b> trips to tighten their family bonds and develop family adaptability. As it relates to policy makers, this study calls for more <b>family</b> <b>holidays</b> for adolescents to travel with their parents. Indeed, the present study demonstrates that even short-term <b>family</b> <b>holidays</b> can be an effective means to increase the SWB. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed...|$|R

This followed a demand from the metal industry employers {{at the end of}} 1961 that wage negotiations with IG Metall should take place on a nationwide basis. The demand had been accompanied by notice of the termination of all existing wage agreements. The North Württemberg / North Baden union branch now responded by demanding a general wage increase of 10% and an increase in annual <b>holiday</b> <b>allowance</b> of six days. At the same time Bleicher set to work on union officials, supporters, and the membership more generally in a succession of general meetings, in order to gain support for a possible industrial confrontation. A vote was taken on 2 March which backed the use of [...] "all the means available to the union" [...] in support of forthcoming collective bargaining sessions. It was only at the last minute, with the intervention of the Baden-Württemberg regional government, that strikes and lockouts were avoided. The compromise achieved provided for a 6% wage increase and an increase of three days in the annual <b>holiday</b> <b>allowance.</b> Most contemporary observers saw that as a victory for the union. At the same time the terms of the agreement, identified in popular parlance as the [...] "Stuttgart model", were copied and adopted across the country.|$|R
