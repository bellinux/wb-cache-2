25|$|The fractal {{dimension}} {{of an ordinary}} random walk is 2. The number of balls of size ε required to cover the path increase as ε−2. Two objects of {{fractal dimension}} 2 will intersect with reasonable probability only in a space of dimension 4 or less, the same condition as for a generic pair of planes.

25|$|The {{assumption}} that the <b>free</b> <b>field</b> is identically zero {{is the core of}} the absorber idea. It means that the radiation emitted by each particle is completely absorbed by all other particles present in the universe. To better understand this point, it may be useful to consider how the absorption mechanism works in common materials. At the microscopic scale, it results from the sum of the incoming electromagnetic wave and the waves generated from the electrons of the material, which react to the external perturbation. If the incoming wave is absorbed, the result is a zero outgoing field. In the absorber theory the same concept is used, however, in presence of both retarded and advanced waves.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the major}} results of the {{absorber}} theory is the elegant and clear interpretation of the electromagnetic radiation process. A charged particle that experiences acceleration is known to emit electromagnetic waves, i.e., to lose energy. Thus, the Newtonian equation for the particle [...] must contain a dissipative force (damping term), which takes into account this energy loss. In the causal interpretation of electromagnetism, Lorentz and Abraham proposed that such a force, later called Abraham–Lorentz force, {{is due to the}} retarded self-interaction of the particle with its own field. This first interpretation, however, is not completely satisfactory, as it leads to divergences in the theory and needs some assumptions on the structure of charge distribution of the particle. Dirac generalized the formula to make it relativistically invariant. While doing so, he also suggested a different interpretation.
