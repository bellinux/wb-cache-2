40|$|The Aerosol Single {{scattering}} albedo and Height Estimation (ASHE) algorithm {{was first}} introduced in Jeong and Hsu (2008) to provide aerosol layer height and single scattering albedo (SSA) for biomass burning smoke aerosols. By using multiple satellite sensors synergistically, ASHE can provide the height information over much broader areas than lidar observations alone. The complete ASHE algorithm uses aerosol data from MODIS or VIIRS, OMI or OMPS, and CALIOP. A simplified algorithm also exists that does not require CALIOP data {{as long as the}} SSA of the aerosol layer is provided by another source.

For the judgement of the essential characteristics being specific for shotcrete, like the quality of the shotcrete, the <b>dust</b> <b>development</b> and the resistance against environmental influences relative parameters of judgement are introduced and then theoretically analyzed for several aspects and applied to experimental researches. By means of empirically determined relations it becomes possible to tendentiously forecast the above-mentioned characteristics of shotcrete already in planning. Here it appeared that the choice of the cement type and fineness in combination with the dosage, form and adding-method of the accelerator was decisive for the shotcrete's quality. If the combination is adequately adjusted it is possible to optimize the use of accelerators in the dry-shotcrete method. (orig.)

40|$|The {{etiology}} of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) in horses is closely {{connected with the}} amount of dust particles and mould spores in the air of horse barns. The chronic disease pattern is based on a permanent mechanical irritation and a hypersensitivity reaction of the respiratory tract resulting from long-term exposure to high aerosol concentrations. For the present dissertation, airborne dusts and moulds in two different horse barns of the Röttgen stud farm in Cologne/Germany were studied in detail. Apart from a quantitiative analysis of the aerosols, the main focus of the research was not only on qualitative analyses such as the identification of mould types and the measurement of particle size distributions, but also on the detection of potential dust and mould sources in the barns. Moreover, the acquired data were checked for possible correlations between dust particles and mould spores. In addition to the concentration development of dust particles, it was also possible to carry out long-term measurements of the concentration of mould spores in the air. This was made possible by using an eight-stage Andersen sampler and by a modification of the dust analysis carried out after sampling. Thus, it was possible to avoid the problem of individual stages being overloaded, which often occurs with six-stage Anderson samplers when germ concentrations are high and sampling takes place over longer periods of time. Moreover, the Anderson sampler was successfully used to analyse the size structure of moulds. By this method it was possible to obtain satisfactory and reproducible results. Due to the different day-to-day activities in horse barns, the concentration of dust particles is subject to great fluctuation. To accomplish a constant dust level, selective measurements were carried out at specific times of day. These investigations were complemented with tests using a dust releasing box developed at the Institute of Agricultural Engineering, which was used to simulate dust levels occurring during the feeding of horses with roughage. Both experimental setups were designed to produce homogenous concentrations of airborne dust and mould. The long-term measurements showed that the concentration of airborne particles in horse barns is subject to great diurnal fluctuation, which results in wide scattering of the obtained data. The biggest influences on the development of peak concentrations are the processes of mucking out and refilling the horse boxes with fresh straw as well as the handling of roughage. The analysis of the particle size distribution showed a predominance of fine particles in the barn air, especially of particles with a size of 0, 3 - 0, 4 µm. In addition to the human influence on <b>dust</b> <b>development</b> in the stable during working phases, dust concentrations are kept at a certain level by the constant resuspension of particles due to animal activity. The mould concentrations measured in the barns ranged from 3. 9 to 5. 9 x 105 CFU/m 3 air. The most common mould genera were Eurotium, Wallemia and Cladosporium. The latter two, which were found in batches of straw and hay, are very likely sources of mould in the barn air. By using an Andersen sampler it was possible to establish that spores are in a size range between 2. 1 and 4. 7 µm, which enables them to penetrate to the deep regions of the lungs. A statistical analysis of the relationship between dust particles and mould spores showed a high coefficient of determination only for similar aerosol concentrations and under standardized conditions. The data from the horse barns showed only weak correlations between these two parameters. It was not possible to make predictions about mould levels on the basis of long-term measurements of dust particles in the field studies. This would require additional measurements of airborne germs as well as an indirect detection method. On the basis of these investigations it was possible to isolate weak points in barn management and hygiene and to develop corrective measures to be taken in horse keeping...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} perched semi-permanent lakes in {{wetlands}} are preserved at high elevation in an approximately NW-SE zone along the Murrumbidgee-Lachlan divide, south of Young, central NSW. The location {{of these features}} is unusual in that lakes are commonly located in lower-lying parts of the landscape in depressions or at the break in slope. Although {{the presence of these}} landscape features was originally detailed by the CSIRO in the late 1980 ’s, very little is known about their formation. The wetlands on the divide typically sit near streams and have a natural semi-circular to circular ‘dam’ or wetland bank that impounds water for extended periods. How these drainage barriers are formed is not known. Exploring the structure and materials forming the wetland banks will provide key information relating to wetland formation. This study focuses on a series of wetlands near Binalong called Regans Lagoons. Five geomorphic landscape facets, with different soil and vegetation characteristics, have been described from Regans Lagoons: hills, upper transition, wetland banks, lower transition and wetland floors. The hills and upper transition have highly modified vegetation over deep red podosol soils. The wetland banks support the Southern Tablelands Grassy Woodland on yellow podosol soils, but woodland health has been impacted by agricultural land use. The lower transition supports a more juvenile assemblage of Blakely’s and River Red Gums than seen on the wetland banks. The upper part of the soil profile is a yellow podosol, but lower in the profile a more clay-rich soil, similar to that seen on the wetland floors is present. The wetland floors support grass, sedge and forb vegetation. The soils are sodic tenosols with sufficient illitic and smectitic mixed layer clays to have shrinking and swelling properties when alternately saturated and dried. This results in the formation of micro-gilgai, rounded conical shaped mounds, (20 - 40 cm high separated by smooth hemispherical depressions up to 80 cm in width) on the wetland floor. Particle size and mineralogical analysis shows that there is a bimodal quartz fraction in the soils. The coarse sand component is likely derived from the quartz phenocrysts in the underlying rhyodacitic bedrock (Silurian Hawkins Volcanics), but the silt fraction {{is not likely to be}} derived from bedrock weathering as that typically produces secondary clays and iron oxides. This implies that the quartzose silt-sized fraction may be derived from wind-blown <b>dust.</b> <b>Development</b> of a model for the formation of Regans Lagoons, takes into consideration proposed models together with the detailed information derived from this study. There are two proposed models for formation of perched wetlands similar to those formed along the Murrumbidgee-Lachlan divide. The Bowman Aggradation model proposes that wind-blown dust slowly builds up due to subtle impounding, forming lunettes (Bowman 1993). These clay-rich sediments expand when wet creating an impermeable layer which causes the water to pond, allowing vegetation growth. The accumulation of wind-blown dust over time, leads to the movement of these wetlands upslope, until they are located near the ridgeline. The wetlands get their semi-circular to elliptical shape from rounding by wave action in the wetland. The Twidale model suggests that etch depressions form in two stages (Twidale 1987; Twidale 1990). In the first stage regolith develops down to the rock weathering front. In the second stage the regolith is stripped away exposing the weathering front as an etch surface. Etch depressions are rounded not only during formation but also by wave action in the wetland. Regans Lagoons cannot have formed due to the Bowman Aggradation model as the soil on the hills and upper transition (red podosols), and the wetland banks (yellow podosols) are pedologically well developed so the wetlands are not moving upslope. Regans Lagoons are not formed according to the Twidale model for etch basin formation as the features seen at Regans Lagoons are formed, in part, by accumulation of particulate material, and are not dominantly erosional features. A revised model, the Croft model, proposes that there was initially deep weathering in areas of joint intersection in bedrock, followed by preferential erosion of this regolith to form a small incipient etch depression. Saturation of remnant clays in these depressions enabled localised ponding of water and modification of vegetation. This provided sites where wind-blown dust could accumulate. Semi-circular to elliptical shaped wetland banks formed due to a combination of: initial lunette or wind sheet formation and remobilisation of sediment due to shrinking and swelling activity of accumulating clays on the wetland floor, and by wave action in the wetland lakes. The crest of the Murrumbidgee-Lachlan divide is an undulating elevated series of rises and low hills forming a sinuous linear landform that is relatively stable because stream knick-points either side of the divide have not propagated into this crestal region. Preservation of the perched wetlands along the divide occurs because this is a relatively geomorphically stable part of the landscape...|$|E

Inhalation of dust {{is one of the}} exposure routes of FRs, especially in children and can be hazardous for the respiratory health. Moreover, PFRs are structurally similar to organophosphate pesticides, which have been associated with allergic asthma. Thus, we investigated whether the concentrations of PFRs and PBDEs in indoor dust are associated with the development of childhood asthma. We selected 110 children who developed asthma at 4 or at 8 years old and 110 matched controls from a large prospective birth cohort (BAMSE - Barn, Allergy, Milieu Stockholm Epidemiology). We analyzed the concentrations of 7 PFRs and 21 PBDEs in dust collected around 2 months after birth from the mother's mattress.

40|$|A {{model of}} dust release and <b>dust</b> mantle <b>development</b> by cometary nuclei is {{developed}} {{to explain the}} brightness asymmetry observed in comets before and after perihelion.

If this ratio is greater than about two, the comet will be brighter on the inward path and not lose its mantle near perihelion. Applying the model to comet Halley (dust to volatiles ratio presumed to be less than two), it is predicted that the comet remains without a mantle until it reaches a heliocentric distance of 2. 035 AU after perihelion and loses its mantle suddenly at a distance of about 1. 45 AU on the inward path, causing it to be brighter after perihelion.

Particle extinction properties {{are assumed to be}} independent of position in the storm region, and scattering properties must be selected arbitrarily.

40|$|Abstract: Probably most of {{the major}} {{environmental}} problems of the next century will result from the continuation and sharpening of existing problems that currently do not receive enough political attention. The problems are not necessarily noticed in many cities or then nothing is done even the situation has been detected. The most emerging issues are climate changes, freshwater scarcity, deforestation, and fresh water pollution and population growth. These problems are very complex and their interactions are hard to define. It is very important to examine problems through the social-economic-cultural system. Even the interconnections between environmental problems are now better known, we still lack exact information on how the issues are linked, on what degree they interact and what are the most effective measures. One problem is to integrate land- and water use planning to provide food and water security (UNEP 1999). The major urban population of Kadapa municipality are unbalanced development of the municipal corporation, pollution (air, noise, water and <b>dust</b> pollution) <b>development</b> of urban slums, shortage of housing, highly congested central business area of the Kadapa municipal corporation, high intensity of residential concentration in the old bus stand area, absence of organized commercial areas and shopping centres with sufficient parking and storage facilities, in adequate city services like water supply, drainage, traffic and transportation, narrow circulation pattern of roads in the old bus stand area, development of slums, encroachment of tanks and solid disposals...|$|R

We determine a critical gas density above which the recombination of electrons and ions on the grain surface dominates over the gas-phase recombination. For this regime, we present a self-consistent analytical model which allows us to exactly calculate abundances of charged species in dusty gas, without making assumptions on the grain charge distribution. To demonstrate the importance of the proposed approach, we check whether the conventional approximation of low grain charges is valid for typical protoplanetary disks, and discuss the implications for <b>dust</b> coagulation and <b>development</b> of the "dead zone" in the disk. The presented model is applicable for arbitrary grain-size distributions and, for given dust properties and conditions of the disk, has only one free parameter - the effective mass of the ions, shown to have a low effect on results. The model can be easily included in numerical simulations following the dust evolution in dense molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. Comment: Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
