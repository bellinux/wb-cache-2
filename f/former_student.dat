25|$|This {{investigation}} included {{over one}} hundred interviews of <b>former</b> <b>students,</b> family of <b>former</b> <b>students,</b> and <b>former</b> staff members of the school. The interviews confirmed {{that in addition to}} the implementation of the Individual Rating System, school administrators used corporal punishment as a tool to encourage obedience. The interviews revealed little disagreement about the way in which corporal punishment was administered. The <b>former</b> <b>students</b> were consistent in that punishment was administered by school administrators and adult staff witnesses in the building referred to as the White House. The <b>former</b> <b>students</b> were consistent in stating that a wooden paddle or leather strap was the implement used for administering punishment. The area of disagreement amongst <b>former</b> <b>students</b> was the number of spankings administered and their severity. Although some <b>former</b> <b>students</b> stated that they were “beaten” {{to the point that the}} skin of their buttocks blistered and bled profusely, there was little to no evidence of visible residual scarring. A secondary disagreement was the former students’ perceptions of the punishment process. Some <b>former</b> <b>students</b> stated that their spankings caused them no psychological harm and that they learned from their mistakes while others stated that, mentally, they suffered greatly as a result and still do so to this day.|$|R

5|$|In 1911, it was {{revealed}} that in 1910–11 Curie had conducted an affair of about a year's duration with physicist Paul Langevin, a <b>former</b> <b>student</b> of Pierre's—a married man who was estranged from his wife. This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents. Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker. When the scandal broke, she was away at a conference in Belgium; on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, Camille Marbo.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Tristan Tzara was in Stockholm, {{where he}} married Greta Knutson, {{with whom he}} had a son, Christophe (born 1927). A <b>former</b> <b>student</b> of painter André Lhote, she was known for her {{interest}} in phenomenology and abstract art. Around the same period, with funds from Knutson's inheritance, Tzara commissioned Austrian architect Adolf Loos, a former representative of the Vienna Secession whom he had met in Zürich, to build him a house in Paris. The rigidly functionalist Maison Tristan Tzara, built in Montmartre, was designed following Tzara's specific requirements and decorated with samples of African art. It was Loos' only major contribution in his Parisian years.|$|E
5|$|In late 1954 Reich {{began an}} affair with Grethe Hoff, a former patient. Hoff was married to another <b>former</b> <b>student</b> and patient of his, the {{psychologist}} Myron Sharaf, who decades later, with his Fury on Earth (1983), became Reich's main biographer. Hoff and Sharaf had had their first child the year before Hoff left him for Reich; the marriage was never repaired although the affair had ended by June 1955. Two months later Reich began another relationship, this time with Aurora Karrer, a medical researcher, and, in November, he moved out of Orgonon to an apartment in Alban Towers, Washington, D.C., to live with her, using the pseudonym Dr. Walter Roner.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov, a {{conflicted}} <b>former</b> <b>student,</b> {{lives in}} a tiny, rented room in Saint Petersburg. He refuses all help, even from his friend Razumikhin, and devises a plan to murder and rob an elderly pawn-broker and money-lender, Alyona Ivanovna. His motivation comes from the overwhelming sense that he is predetermined to kill the old woman by some power outside of himself. While still considering the plan, Raskolnikov makes the acquaintance of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, a drunkard who recently squandered his family's little wealth. Raskolnikov also receives a letter from his sister and mother, speaking of their coming visit to Saint Petersburg, and his sister's sudden marriage plans which they plan to discuss upon their arrival.|$|E

5|$|The Kwan Um School of Zen {{was founded}} in 1983 and, unlike more {{traditional}} practice in Korea, Seungsahn allowed laypersons in the lineage to wear the robes of full monastics. Celibacy was not required and the rituals of the school are unique. Although the Kwan Um School does utilize traditional Seon and Zen rituals, elements of their practice also closely resemble rituals found often in Pure Land Buddhism, Chan Buddhism, and the Huayan school. In 1986, along with a <b>former</b> <b>student</b> and Dharma heir Dae Gak, Seungsahn founded a retreat center and temple in Clay City, Kentucky called Furnace Mountain—the temple name being Kwan Se Um San Ji Sah (or, Perceive World Sound High Ground Temple).
