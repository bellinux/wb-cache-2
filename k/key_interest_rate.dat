2500|$|On 18 December 2014, the Swiss {{central bank}} {{introduced}} a {{negative interest rate}} on bank deposits to support its CHF ceiling. However, with the euro declining in value over the following weeks, in a move dubbed Francogeddon for its effect on markets, the Swiss National Bank abandoned the ceiling on 15 January 2015, and the franc promptly increased in value compared with the euro by 30%, although this only lasted {{a few minutes before}} part of the increase was reversed. The move was not announced in advance and resulted in [...] "turmoil" [...] in stock and currency markets. By the close of trading that day, the franc was up 23% against the euro and 21% against the US dollar. The full daily range of franc was equal to $31,000 per single futures contract (to the positive if long, to the negative if short), and is more than the market moved collectively in the previous thousand days. [...] The <b>key</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> was also lowered from −0.25% to −0.75%, meaning investors would be paying an increased fee to keep their funds in a Swiss bank account. This devaluation of the euro against the franc is expected to hurt Switzerland's large export industry. The Swatch Group, for example, saw its shares drop 15% (in Swiss franc terms) with the announcements so that the share price may have increased on that day in terms of other major currencies.|$|E

50|$|The {{overnight}} policy rate is {{an overnight}} interest rate set by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) used for monetary policy direction. It {{is the target}} rate for the day-to-day liquidity operations of the BNM. The overnight policy rate (OPR) is the interest rate at which a depository institution lends immediately available funds (balances within the central bank) to another depository institution overnight. The amount of money a bank has fluctuates daily based on its lending activities and its customers’ withdrawal and deposit activity, therefore the bank may experience a shortage or surplus of cash {{at the end of}} the business day. Those banks that experience a surplus often lend money overnight to banks that experience a shortage so the banking system remains stable and liquid. This is an efficient method for banks around the world to practice 'Accessing short-term financing' from the central bank depositories. The interest rate of the OPR is influenced by the central bank, where it is a good predictor for the movement of short-term interest rates. In 2014, Malaysia’s central bank raised its <b>key</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> for the first time in more than three years, to help temper inflation and rising consumer debt.|$|E
