Joining the first team, Manojlović started 2014-15 Serbian SuperLiga {{season as the}} 4th choice behind Predrag Rajković, Damir Kahriman and Marko Trkulja. He was also loaned on <b>dual</b> <b>registrations</b> {{for the next two}} seasons to get a senior experience, being also licensed with the first team as an back-up option for the Serbian SuperLiga. In summer 2016, Manojlović moved to Bačka Bačka Palanka at six-month loan, where he made his first appearances in the first tier of the Serbian football pyramid. However, a loan deal had been terminated shortly after and Manojlović returned to Red Star in last days of the summer transer window. On 14 September 2016, Manojlović extended his contract with club until summer 2020. He made his official debut for Red Star Belgrade in eternal derby, played on 17 September 2016 under coach Miodrag Božović. Manojlović collected 29 appearances in both domestic competitions including league and cup games, missing several matches before the end of a season under Boško Đurovski. Manojlović also started new season as a first choise under new menager, Vladan Milojević. On 29 June 2017, he made his first continental appearance for the club in first leg of the first qualifying round for 2017-18 UEFA Europa League, against Floriana, keeping a clean sheet.

40|$|In {{the year}} 2000, the Israeli Securities Authority (ISA) {{initiated}} a new {{amendment to the}} Securities Law aimed at promoting dual listing of Israeli companies, already traded in the US, and not in Israel, by exempting them from the burden of additional reporting to the ISA. According to this amendment, the ISA agreed to rely solely on the reporting requirements of the US SEC. Since then, more than 30 Israeli companies, traded on Nasdaq decided to list their shares on the TASE as well. This event allows us to examine the effect dual listing had on share prices and liquidity in a unique setup that annuls the costs of <b>dual</b> listing <b>registration.</b> The main findings are as follows: 1) trade volume of the dual listed companies has grown by about 123 % on; 2) about 42 % of the total volume is on the TASE without adversely affect the trading volume on the Nasdaq; 3) as a result, share prices went up by about 9.

40|$|Ultrasound {{has become}} popular in clinical/surgical applications, both {{as the primary}} image {{guidance}} modality and also {{in conjunction with other}} modalities like CT or MRI. Three dimensional ultrasound (3 DUS) systems have also demonstrated usefulness in image-guided therapy (IGT). At the same time, however, current lack of open-source and open-architecture multi-modal medical visualization systems prevents 3 DUS from fulfilling its potential. Several standalone 3 DUS systems, like Stradx or In-Vivo exist today. Although these systems {{have been found to be}} useful in real clinical setting, it is difficult to augment their functionality and integrate them in versatile IGT systems. To address these limitations, a robotic/freehand 3 DUS open environment (CISUS) is being integrated into the 3 D Slicer, an opensource research tool developed for medical image analysis and surgical planning. In addition, the system capitalizes on generic application programming interfaces (APIs) for tracking devices and robotic control. The resulting platformindependent open-source system may serve as a valuable tool to the image guided surgery community. Other researchers could straightforwardly integrate the generic CISUS system along with other functionalities (i. e. <b>dual</b> view visualization, <b>registration,</b> real-time tracking, segmentation, etc…) to rapidly create their medical/surgical applications. Our current driving clinical application is robotically assisted and freehand 3 DUS-guided liver ablation, which is fully being integrated under the CISUS- 3 D Slicer.

40|$|This thesis {{takes the}} form of an {{investigation}} into the lack of progress towards the professionalisation of mental nurses during the period 1850 to 1950 and concentrates on their failure to become a professional sub-group within nursing. The proposal is put forward that their relative failure to advance was {{due to the fact that}} mental nurses were controlled and dominated by other more powerful health care groups with their own agendas. These were the asylum doctors in the (Royal) Medico-Psychological Association ((R) MPA), and the doctors and general trained nurses in the General Nursing Council (GNC). During the 1850 s the (R) MPA's main concern was to raise the status of asylum doctors. The association aimed to achieve this by developing the care and treatment of the insane into another recognised speciality of medicine. To do this they needed to hospitalise the asylums, a process which would include transforming asylum attendants into qualified mental nurses. To this end a mental nursing textbook was published by the (R) MPA in 1885. This was followed by the inauguration of a national training scheme with certification for successful candidates. In order to advance the goal of hospitalisation, female nurses were introduced into male wards in many asylums. It was also asserted that the care of insane male patients was improved, a claim which led to conflicts with the trade unions, which were totally opposed to female nurses on male wards. The impact of unionisation of mental nurses will also be discussed in relationship to the struggle for professionalisation. Even when the Nurses' Registration Act 1919 was passed, mental nurses were caught in the middle of an internecine conflict over who controlled them: on one side was the GNC with its new supplementary register for mental nurses; on the other stood the (R) MPA, reluctant to give up their training and examination scheme under the conditions offered by the GNC. So a <b>dual</b> system of <b>registration</b> continued to exist until the introduction of the National Health Service in 1948. Even then mental nursing was still controlled by the general trained dominated GNC...|$|R
