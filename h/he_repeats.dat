25|$|Pomponius {{is unique}} among ancient geographers in that, after {{dividing}} the earth into five zones, of which two only were habitable, he asserts {{the existence of}} antichthones, inhabiting the southern temperate zone inaccessible to the folk of the northern temperate regions from the unbearable heat of the intervening torrid belt. On the divisions and boundaries of Europe, Asia and Africa, <b>he</b> <b>repeats</b> Eratosthenes; like all classical geographers from Alexander the Great (except Ptolemy) he regards the Caspian Sea as an inlet of the Northern Ocean, corresponding to the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea on the south.|$|E

25|$|According to {{journalist}} Ivan Tolstoi, the British MI6 and the American CIA lent a hand {{to ensure}} that Doctor Zhivago was submitted to the Nobel Committee in the original Russian. According to Tolstoi, this was done so that Pasternak could win the Nobel prize and harm the international credibility of the Soviet Union. <b>He</b> <b>repeats</b> and elaborates upon Feltrinelli's claims that the CIA operatives had photographed a manuscript of the novel and secretly printed {{a small number of}} books in the Russian language. More recently, Anna Sergeyeva-Klyatis wrote that the first Russian edition of Doctor Zhivago, which was a pirated version with numerous typographical errors and omissions, was actually initiated by the Central Association of Postwar Émigrées, in response to a growing demand among Russian émigrés.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} staples thesis, {{advocated by}} {{scholars such as}} S.A. Saunders, looks at the resource endowments of the Maritimes and argues {{that it was the}} decline of the traditional industries of shipbuilding and fishing that led to Maritime poverty, since these processes were rooted in geography, and thus all but inevitable. Kris Inwood has revived the staples approach and looks at a number of geographic weaknesses relative to Central Canada. <b>He</b> <b>repeats</b> Acheson's argument that the region lacks major urban centres, but adds that the Maritimes were also lacking the great rivers that led to the cheap and abundant hydro-electric power, key to Quebec and Ontario's urban and manufacturing development, that the extraction costs of Maritime resources were higher (particularly in the case of Cape Breton coal), and that the soils of the region were poorer and thus the agricultural sector weaker.|$|E
25|$|In verses 1357 to 2249 Lanzelet embarks on the {{adventure}} of Lord Linier of Limors, whom he unwittingly provokes. Lanzelet is thrown in the dungeon before he is brought out onto the battlefield, where he is confronted with a giant, lions and finally Linier, whom he kills. He marries Linier's niece, Ade, without having divorced his previous wife and once again becomes a lord. <b>He</b> <b>repeats</b> this same pattern with his other wives. In the verses leading up to 3474, he fights Walwein, a knight of the Round Table, and wins the tournament in Djofle, but refuses King Arthur's invitation to the court. In verses 3475 to 4673, Lanzelet goes to the Castle of the Dead, which belongs to Mabuz, the fairy queen's son. The castle holds a strange power that turns the brave who enter it into cowards and vice versa. Mabuz successfully forces Lanzelet to kill Iweret. Lanzelet then marries Iweret’s daughter, Iblis.|$|E

25|$|Harry is Edna’s {{husband and}} Tobias’s best friend. At {{one point in}} the past, Harry and Tobias, coincidentally, had an extramarital affair with the same young woman. Besides both having been {{businessmen}} and meeting at the same club, it is unclear what else Harry and Tobias have in common except that they have known one another {{for a long time and}} neither sleeps with his wife. Harry is something of a reflection of Tobias, but he is even more reserved. Of all the characters in this play, Harry speaks the least. And when he does speak, he is a man of few words with lots of pauses around each one. He prefers to talk around things rather than going at them straight on. He also avoids questions, as when Agnes tries to find out why he and his wife have come to their home. Instead of giving Agnes an answer, he compliments the furnishings in Agnes’s home. He also has the tendency to repeat himself; at one point <b>he</b> <b>repeats</b> the same line four times when he tries to explain how fear has driven his wife and him out of their home. It is Harry, in the end, who tells Tobias that he and Edna have decided to leave. Although Harry prompted the discussion with Edna about resolving the issue of staying at their friends’ house, it is implied that Edna made the decision and that Harry just delivered the message.|$|E

While following her, {{he is in a}} hallway, with the women then pulling Usher in a room, where they begin to romance. While Ludacris says his final verse, rapper Chingy and P. Diddy's former assistant, Fonzworth Bentley, both make appearances with Bentley holding a violin. Lil Jon says his final verse, not present in the track version of [...] "Yeah!", where <b>he</b> <b>repeats</b> numerous dance moves including the Rockaway and Thunderclap, with Usher performing them. The video ends with Lil Jon repeating [...] "rock away" [...] and then [...] "cut".|$|E
500|$|Michigan band Salem {{released}} a slowed-down {{version of the}} song, and made a music video featuring seemingly underage strippers and military footage. A remix featuring R.

His vocals join those of Spears during the breakdown, and the song ends with Kelly doing runs over the chorus.

500|$|Sugiyama {{has stated}} that Sasuke's line [...] "you are annoying" [...] sums up Sasuke's {{feelings}} towards Sakura. He is initially annoyed by her, yet when <b>he</b> <b>repeats</b> it before leaving Konohagakure, he is smiling. Naruto's voice actor, Junko Takeuchi, remarked that Sasuke's line [...] "See you next time… Thank you," [...] addressed to Sakura, revealed his feeling for her. Sugiyama noted that by the end, Sasuke realized how much he hurt Sakura's feelings across the series, and apologized to her after his final fight against Naruto. In preparations for the film , Sugiyama expected to see a bond between Sasuke and his student, Boruto. For the Boruto anime series, Sugiyama noted {{a major change in}} Sasuke's personality and he wanted fans to see the character's interaction with his family.|$|E
500|$|Professor Cuthbert Calculus (Professeur Tryphon Tournesol in Hergé's {{original}} version; tournesol is the French {{word for}} sunflower) is an absent-minded and partially-deaf physicist {{and a regular}} character alongside Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock. He was introduced in Red Rackham's Treasure, and based partially on , a Swiss physicist. The leading characters do not initially welcome his presence, but through his generous nature and his scientific ability, he develops a lasting bond with them. Eventually, {{by the end of}} Land of Black Gold, he becomes a resident of Marlinspike Hall. Normally mild-mannered and dignified, Calculus occasionally loses his temper and acts in a spectacularly aggressive manner in response to actual or perceived insults, such as when Captain Haddock belittles his work or accuses him of [...] "acting the goat". He is a fervent believer in dowsing, and carries a pendulum for that purpose. Calculus's deafness is a frequent source of humour, as <b>he</b> <b>repeats</b> back what he thinks he has heard, usually in the most unlikely words possible. He does not admit to being near-deaf and insists he is only [...] "a little hard of hearing in one ear." ...|$|E
500|$|Buffy's {{numbers are}} the most complex, {{changing}} key and tempo when she begins to reveal the secrets she swore she never would. This appears specifically in [...] "Something to Sing About", which starts with uptempo platitudes: [...] "We'll sing a happy song / And you can sing along: / Where there's life, there's hope / Every day's a gift / Wishes can come true / Whistle while you work..." [...] While singing, she kills Sweet's minions with a pool cue. Whedon attempted to make the song tuneful yet chaotic to express the main point of the episode. It transitions suddenly into her desire to be like normal girls, then changes again, slowing the tempo as she challenges Sweet not {{to give her a}} song, but [...] "something to sing about". Musicologist Amy Bauer categorizes the tempo shifts as [...] "rock ballad to punk polka to hymn" [...] that indicates Buffy's turmoil. The key and tempo slow again, as Buffy finally reveals [...] "I live in hell / 'Cause I've been expelled from heaven / I think I was in heaven" [...] with the chord changing from B minor to B diminished, each time she repeats [...] "heaven". When replying to her, Spike has the same shift from minor to diminished each time <b>he</b> <b>repeats</b> the word [...] "living." ...|$|E

500|$|Mars co-wrote [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine of The Smeezingtons. The three co-produced {{the song}} with Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker, and Emile Haynie. It {{was written in}} the key of D minor, with Mars's vocals range from the low note of A3 to the high note of C5. Levine {{aforementioned}} that some parts in the song are not instruments as Mars said they needed [...] "a dep-dep-dep-dep sound". Later, Levine told Mars to [...] "sing it into the microphone", where he chopped it up, and despite sounding like an instrument, the sounds are really Mars' voice. The song's composition relies mainly on a [...] "guitar-worthy groove guitar, a soaring sing-along chorus and sexual innuendo galore". It finds Mars singing a confession of a relationship that is so good that <b>he</b> <b>repeats</b> to his love [...] "Your sex takes me to paradise", a verse inspired by Halle Berry [...] "You make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven for too long/ Can I just stay here, {{spend the rest of my}} days here?" [...] he sings. During his Google Hangout on the day of the song's release, Mars was asked by a fan to name his favorite lyrics from the track. Mars picked the phrase [...] "But swimming in your water is something spiritual," [...] and said that the single's exploration of feeling and being in love fits into the [...] "sensual, sensual and sensual" [...] theme of the album.|$|E
