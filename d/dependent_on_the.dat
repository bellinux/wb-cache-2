5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dielectric constant of the material.|$|E
5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> polarization of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, the {{woodwasp}} {{is fully}} <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> symbionts. Decomposition enables the larvae {{to unlock the}} wood by producing white rot. The mycetangia of this and other wasps from the family Siricidae support {{a close relationship with}} saprobiontic fungi. Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can recover from the consequences of the wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing the larvae.|$|E
