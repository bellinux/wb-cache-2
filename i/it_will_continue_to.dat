5|$|The small glaciers in {{the forest}} are less able to resist melting than the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica.

Without a {{favorable}} climate change, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> retreat until it disappears. Loss of glacial ice already reduces the summer glacial runoff that supplies water to streams and lakes and provides a cold-water source vital to certain fish and plant species.
