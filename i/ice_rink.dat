5|$|Altrincham {{is one of}} the few {{towns in}} North West England with an <b>ice</b> <b>rink,</b> and has had an ice hockey team since 1961, when Altrincham <b>Ice</b> <b>Rink</b> was built in Broadheath. The Altrincham Aces (later renamed the Trafford Metros) played from 1961 until 2003, when Altrincham <b>Ice</b> <b>Rink</b> closed. The town then had a three-year period without a rink or ice hockey team, until {{construction}} of the 2,500 capacity Altrincham Ice Dome was completed. Manchester Phoenix, a club having a professional presence in the English Premier Ice Hockey League and an extensive junior development aspect, relocated to the Ice Dome during the 2006–07 season, having withdrawn from competition two years earlier due to the high cost of playing matches at Manchester's MEN Arena. In 2009 the Manchester Phoenix English National Ice Hockey League team was renamed Trafford Metros, bringing the old Altrincham team's name back into use. When not being used by Phoenix the Altrincham Ice Dome is open to the public for ice skating.|$|E

5|$|The <b>ice</b> <b>rink</b> is {{the home}} of Lillehammer IK, which plays in GET-ligaen, the premier ice hockey league in Norway. During the season, they play one to two home games per week, {{typically}} attracting crowds of 1,000 to 1,500 spectators. They inaugurated the arena in December 1988 with a game against Oshaug. The <b>ice</b> <b>rink</b> is also used by the Norwegian College of Elite Sport in Lillehammer and Lillehammer Kunstløpklubb. The handball court is used by Lillehammer Innebandyklubb and Lillehammerstudentenes IL, while the curling rink is used by Lillehammer Curlingklubb. The venue is owned and operated by Lillehammer Municipality.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic <b>ice</b> <b>rinks</b> are {{sometimes}} used where frozen ice surfaces are impractical due to temperatures making natural ice impossible. Synthetic <b>ice</b> <b>rinks</b> {{are also used}} {{as an alternative to}} artificial <b>ice</b> <b>rinks</b> due to the overall cost, not requiring any refrigeration equipment. For pleasure skating, rinks have been installed indoors at resorts and entertainment venues while newer installations are being made outdoors. For purposes of ice hockey, synthetic <b>ice</b> <b>rinks</b> are typically smaller, at about 50 ft by 50 ft, and are used for specialized training, such as shooting or goalie training.|$|R
50|$|There are {{basically}} two rink sizes in use, {{although there is}} a great deal of variation in the dimensions of actual <b>ice</b> <b>rinks.</b> Historically, earlier <b>ice</b> <b>rinks</b> were smaller than today.|$|R
50|$|The biggest North African country, Egypt, has 11 <b>ice</b> <b>rinks</b> in 6 {{cities in}} six {{different}} governorates. There are 3 <b>ice</b> <b>rinks</b> {{in the capital}} city, Cairo. In addition to other 3 in Sharm el-Sheikh, two in the 6th of October City, {{as well as one}} rink in Hurghada, 1 in Tanta and another in Borg El Arab. The biggest of those <b>ice</b> <b>rinks</b> is found in Sun City Mall in east Cairo that has a surface area of only 300 m2. Seven of the Egyptian <b>rinks</b> have <b>ice</b> grounds while 4 are wax rinks.|$|R
5|$|During {{the summer}} months, the restaurant's outdoor seating area becomes the largest al fresco dining area in Chicago. During the winter months, the restaurant's outdoor seating area becomes the McCormick Tribune Plaza & <b>Ice</b> <b>Rink,</b> and diners in the 300-seat The Park Grill overlooks the ice skating rink through floor-to-ceiling windows.|$|E
5|$|The AT Plaza is {{a public}} space that hosts the Cloud Gate sculpture. The plaza opened in July 2004 with the {{unveiling}} of the sculpture during the grand opening weekend of the park. Ameritech donated $3million for the naming right for the plaza, but it was SBC Plaza when the park opened, as a merger had changed the company name to SBC Communications. The 2005 merger of SBC and AT Corporation led to the present name. The sculpture and the AT Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza & <b>Ice</b> <b>Rink.</b> The plaza has become a place to view the McCormick Tribune Plaza & <b>Ice</b> <b>Rink.</b> During the holiday season, the plaza hosts Christmas caroling.|$|E
5|$|The babies {{discover}} a tiny lizard in Tommy Pickles' backyard {{that they are}} convinced is the offspring of Reptar, a fictitious green dinosaur and main character of many action movies of which the Rugrats are fond. After learning about the extinction of the dinosaurs, Tommy decides to return the lizard to Reptar just as his family has purchased tickets for a musical ice show based on the character. After Tommy's parents and grandfather have fallen asleep, the babies sneak into the <b>ice</b> <b>rink</b> and present the lizard to Leo, the actor portraying Reptar, who coincidentally happens to possess a phobia of lizards. Stu Pickles, Tommy's father, sees the rugrats and must retrieve them from the <b>ice</b> <b>rink.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{running track}} was renovated in 2003, and {{received}} a new surface layer and paint job. In 2005, the club house was completed by the women's football club. In 2006, the gravel <b>ice</b> <b>rink</b> received an artificial ice machine to secure stable ice conditions throughout the winter.|$|E
5|$|Because {{half the}} country's surface {{consists}} of exposed rock, Norway has {{a tradition of}} building mountain cavern halls for many purposes, from tunnels via power plants to sport centers. These often double up as bomb shelters. Gjøvik Municipality opened Norway's first underground swimming pool in 1974. The idea to build an underground <b>ice</b> <b>rink</b> came from Consulting Engineer Jan A. Rygh while having dinner with Municipal Engineer Helge Simenstad in 1988, after the latter said that Gjøvik had been awarded an <b>ice</b> <b>rink</b> for the Olympics. The first drafts were made on a napkin in the restaurant. An alternative proposal for a conventional rink was also made. Among the advantage of a cavern hall was that it would not take up valuable downtown property space or interfere with the town's cityscape, yet it would be centrally located which would reduce travel costs, and there would be a stable year-round natural temperature which would reduce cooling costs.|$|E

5|$|Jordal Amfi, {{an outdoor}} {{artificial}} <b>ice</b> <b>rink,</b> was built with {{a capacity for}} 10,000 spectators. This allowed ice hockey to be played on artificial ice {{for the first time}} at the Olympics. Of the tournament's 36 matches, 23 were played at Jordal, while the remaining were played at Kadettangen in Bærum, Dælenenga idrettspark in Oslo, Lillestrøm stadion in Skedsmo and Marienlyst stadion in Drammen.|$|E
5|$|Kristins Hall is {{an arena}} located at Stampesletta in Lillehammer, Norway. It consist of an <b>ice</b> <b>rink,</b> a {{combined}} handball and floorball court, and a curling rink. The venue, {{owned and operated}} by the Lillehammer Municipality, opened in 1988 and cost 65 million Norwegian krone (NOK) to build. One of the motivations for its construction was to help Lillehammer's bid to be selected as the host of the 1994 Winter Olympics. The <b>ice</b> <b>rink</b> has a capacity for 3,194 spectators and is the home rink of GET-ligaen hockey club Lillehammer IK. Kristins Hall is located next to the larger Håkons Hall, which opened in 1993. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Kristins Hall was a training rink, and subsequently hosted the ice sledge hockey tournament at the 1994 Winter Paralympics. The venue also co-hosted Group B of the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships.|$|E

40|$|I hereby {{declare that}} I am the sole {{author of this}} thesis. This is a true copy of the thesis, {{including}} any required final revisions, as accepted by my examiners. I understand that my thesis may be made electronically available to the public. ii <b>Ice</b> <b>rinks</b> are large commercial buildings which facilitate various activities such as hockey, figure skating, curling, recreational skating, public arenas, auditoriums and col-iseums. These have a complex energy system, in which an enormous sheet of ice is main-tained at a low temperature {{while at the same}} time the spectator stands are heated to ensure comfortable conditions for the spectators. Since indoor <b>ice</b> <b>rinks</b> account for a sig-nificant share of the commercial sector and are in operation for more than 8 months a year, their contribution in the total demand cannot be ignored. Thus, there is significant scope for energy savings in indoor <b>ice</b> <b>rinks</b> through optimal operation of their climate control systems. In this work, a mathematical model of indoor <b>ice</b> <b>rinks</b> for the implementation of Energ...|$|R

The water has been dyed with the 'Blue Lagoon' aquatic dye to control the growth of algae and bacteria. The nontoxic aquatic dye attenuates the penetration of light into the water, and tints the water blue.|$|E

5|$|City {{recreation}} facilities {{include two}} ice hockey arenas, a curling rink, an indoor swimming pool, an outdoor <b>ice</b> <b>rink,</b> and a speed skating oval. The South Peace Community Multiplex, {{a new facility}} completed in 2010, boasts a pool, indoor rodeo grounds and <b>ice</b> <b>rink.</b> Voters approved building the Multiplex in a 2004 referendum which projected its cost at C$21.6 million. The project became controversial when construction began and the cost projection was raised to $35 million. The facility is located close to the city's exhibition grounds, away from residential uses. It features an indoor rodeo arena and a 4,000-seat convention centre/ice arena with skyboxes. Nearby Bear Mountain, located south of the city, provides over 20km (12mi) of snowshoeing and cross-country skiing trails, as well as areas for downhill skiing and about 500km (300mi) of trails for snowmobiles, mountain bikes, and all-terrain vehicles. The city was once home to a North American Hockey League team, the Dawson Creek Rage, beginning in the 2010–11 season until it ceased operations in 2012 due to financial difficulties.|$|E

5|$|The 2016 Winter Youth Olympics in {{and around}} Lillehammer, Norway, between 12 February and 21 February 2016. Nine {{competition}} and twelve non-competition venues are to be used; all except the Youth Olympic Village in Lillehammer and a training <b>ice</b> <b>rink</b> being are existing venues. All the competition venues {{and some of the}} non-competition venues were built ahead of the 1994 Winter Olympics. The games be held in four municipalities: Lillehammer, Hamar, Gjøvik and Øyer.|$|E
5|$|The {{artificial}} ice {{increased the}} popularity of playing ice hockey in the neighborhood. The club therefore started working on plans to build an indoor <b>ice</b> <b>rink</b> over the artificial rink. Planning of the hall started in 1989, and in 1990 {{a proposal for a}} steel structure was launched. However, it was rejected by the municipality. The club therefore hired Einar Dahle Arkitekter to work on a new design, resulting in area planning regulations being passed in 1991. Financing of the steel structure had been secured in loans, but these were stopped following a credit crunch. In 1994, the municipality initiated a redevelopment program of the downtown residential areas, which included grants to build Grünerhallen. The hall was estimated to cost NOK23.4 million and the contract was awarded to Mur 6 Tax. Construction started in March 1995 and the venue opened on 6 October 1995, as the 30th indoor <b>ice</b> <b>rink</b> in Norway. In 1996, the city council had to grant an additional NOK4.6 million to cover cost overruns.|$|E
