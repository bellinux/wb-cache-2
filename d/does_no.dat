5|$|In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Mario uses FLUDD {{as a new}} special {{move that}} <b>does</b> <b>no</b> damage, but pushes opponents away. Brawl also has the {{fighting}} stage Delfino Plaza, a replica of Isle Delfino's capital city, with a platform carrying the fighters to any location of the stage on occasion. The original background music of Delfino Plaza occasionally plays on the stage, {{as well as the}} BGM for Ricco Harbor. The game also features several stickers based on artwork from Super Mario Sunshine. Most of these features were retained in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and the Delfino Plaza was retained in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Bowser Jr. himself debuted as a new playable fighter in the game, and utilizes his Magic Paintbrush and Shadow Mario form from Super Mario Sunshine in his Final Smash.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{investigates the}} airbag on Skinner's car, {{which was the}} one used to hit Sharon. Scully defends Skinner to the Office of Professional Responsibility, but it <b>does</b> <b>no</b> good and he is fired. Mulder {{believes}} this was done to weaken the X-Files. Mulder, {{with the help of}} Agent Pendrell finds a face imprint in the airbag which is not Skinner's. He goes to see the prostitute's boss again but discovers that she has been murdered. The agents hope to use Judy, an employee who saw the man who actually hired the prostitute and use her to set up another meeting with him. They agree to meet at the Ambassador Hotel in an hour. Skinner goes to see his wife, telling her why he could not sign the divorce papers. An alarm on Sharon's vital sign monitor starts sounding, but as Skinner is about to run for help, the old woman once again takes the place of Sharon, beckoning him to come closer. As Skinner leans in, he sees his wife again, now awakened from the coma; she says something inaudible to him.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other uses}} have been {{researched}} for bupropion. There has been controversy {{about whether it}} is useful to add an antidepressant such as bupropion to a mood stabilizer in people with bipolar depression, but recent reviews have concluded that bupropion in this situation <b>does</b> <b>no</b> significant harm and may sometimes give significant benefit. Bupropion has shown no effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but there is weak evidence that it may be useful in treating methamphetamine dependence. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion—like other antidepressants, with the exception of duloxetine (Cymbalta)—is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. It does, however, show some promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E

25|$|The Drones Club is in Mayfair, London, {{located in}} Dover Street, off Piccadilly. A drone being a male bee that <b>does</b> <b>no</b> work, {{living off the}} labour of others, it aptly {{describes}} the contemporary Edwardian stereotype of rich, idle young club members. Pongo Twistleton, for example, was reading for the Bar, and other members were mentioned as holding down jobs.|$|E

He lifts her into the air, and takes her to present the box to Venus.|$|E

25|$|As an {{alternative}} to playback with a stylus, a recording can be read optically, processed with software that calculates the velocity that the stylus would be moving in the mapped grooves and converted to a digital recording format.

25|$|The Church {{claims that}} the E-meter {{can be used to}} assess the emotion charge of single words, whole sentences, and questions, as well as {{indicating}} the general state of the subject when the operator is not speaking. Few users of the E-meter claim that it does anything to the subject. To most, it <b>does</b> <b>no</b> more than suggest to the operator a change of mental, emotional, or parasympathetic nervous state or activity.|$|E
25|$|Some {{programming}} languages may use {{a feature}} called smart linking whereby the linker {{is aware of}} or integrated with the compiler, such that the linker knows how external references are used, and code in a library that is never actually used, even though internally referenced, can be discarded from the compiled application. For example, a program that only uses integers for arithmetic, or <b>does</b> <b>no</b> arithmetic operations at all, can exclude floating-point library routines. This smart-linking feature can lead to smaller application file sizes and reduced memory usage.|$|E

25|$|In the {{reference}} {{frame of the}} interface between two surfaces, static friction <b>does</b> <b>no</b> work, because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does negative work. However, friction can do positive work in certain frames of reference. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling on the rug quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box {{in the same direction}} that the box moves, doing positive work.|$|E
25|$|Later, after Andrew departs, {{the women}} briefly gain {{the company of}} an {{ordinary}} Christian driving a cart but lose it when they are abducted by a passing prefect. Rebecca later manages to escape and flee to an old woman's house (and disappears from the story). Meanwhile, Polyxena begs the prefect's servants to preserve her virginity; so they tell the prefect that she is ill. The prefect's son, a convert to Christianity after witnessing Paul's effect on Thecla, disguises her in his clothing and sends her to the shore to catch a ship. But a villainous servant overhears and reports them. They are captured and thrown to a lioness in the arena. But the lioness {{turns out to be}} the one previously encountered and <b>does</b> <b>no</b> harm. As a result, the entire city takes this to be proof of the truth of Christianity and so convert en-masse.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{stored in}} {{capacitive}} or inductive {{elements of the}} network give rise to reactive power flow. Reactive power flow strongly influences the voltage levels across the network. Voltage levels and reactive power flow must be carefully controlled to allow a power system to be operated within acceptable limits. A technique known as reactive compensation is used to reduce apparent power flow to a load by reducing reactive power supplied from transmission lines and providing it locally. For example, to compensate an inductive load a shunt capacitor is installed close to the load itself. This allows all reactive power needed by the load to be supplied by the capacitor {{and not have to}} be transferred over the transmission lines. This practice alone does not save energy in a direct way, because reactive power <b>does</b> <b>no</b> work. But because the reactive component of the current is now only flowing locally, it is producing heat only in the local conductors and thus saving total energy.|$|E

500|$|This {{difference}} {{is typical of}} many endgames. Usually DTC is smaller than DTM, but the DTM metric leads to the quickest checkmate. Exceptions occur where the weaker side has only a king, and in the unusual endgame of two knights versus one pawn; then DTC = DTM because either there is no defending material to capture or capturing the material <b>does</b> <b>no</b> good. (Indeed, capturing the defending pawn in the latter endgame results in a draw, unless it results in immediate mate.) ...|$|E
