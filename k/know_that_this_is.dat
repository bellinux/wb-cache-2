500|$|Despite having {{plans for}} a tour of Europe to promote Spiderland, Slint broke up in November 1990, after Brian McMahan decided to quit the band. Members of the band went on to join other musical projects, {{including}} Tortoise, The Breeders, Palace and The For Carnation. Slint reunited briefly in 2005 for an eighteen-date tour. Pajo said, [...] "We don't {{want to be a}} reunion band that keeps reuniting.... I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> going to be it."

It took some getting used to, some revisiting the material and rehearsing." [...] In an August 2013 interview with Vish Khanna, former producer Steve Albini revealed that the band was working on remastering Spiderland with engineer Bob Weston.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Che {{was going}} to be made in English and was met with a strong {{interest}} in financing; however, when {{the decision was made to}} make it in Spanish and break it up into two films, the studios' pay-TV deals, which were for English-language product only, [...] "disappeared", according to Bickford, [...] "and, at that point, nobody wanted to step up". The director defended his decision to shoot almost all of the film in Spanish in an interview: [...] "You can't make a film with any level of credibility in this case unless it's in Spanish. I hope we're reaching a time where you go make a movie in another culture, that you shoot in the language of that culture. I'm hoping the days of that sort of specific brand of cultural imperialism have ended". Both films were financed without any American money or distribution deal; [...] Soderbergh remarked, [...] "It was very frustrating to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a zeitgeist movie and that some of the very people who told me how much they now regret passing on Traffic passed on this one too". Foreign pre-sales covered $54 million of the $58 million budget. Wild Bunch, a French production, distribution and foreign sales company put up 75% of the budget for the two films, tapping into a production and acquisition fund from financing and investment company Continental Entertainment Capitol, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Citigroup. Spain's Telecinco/Moreno Films supplied the rest of the budget.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} gained a {{significant}} amount of airplay on the BET and MTV networks, as it increased mainstream notice and appeal of D'Angelo upon the release of Voodoo in January 2000. Viewer response to the [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] music video was largely divided along sexual lines, as female viewers generally expressed favor to the video. Additionally, D'Angelo's video appearance, including a notable amount of sweating around his abdomen, contributed to rumors of him receiving oral sex in the video. For an April 2000 article for Vibe, Questlove interviewed D'Angelo and asked him [...] "Are you getting head in that video?", after which D'Angelo responded by laughing. Questlove then asked [...] "So you're not going to answer that?", and D'Angelo responded, [...] "No". In her response to the video, television personality Star Jones said that, [...] "D'Angelo is singing about being intimate with a woman that he loves, and it's just basic voice and body, and when you're in an intimate situation with a man, that's really all that's there — the voice and the body and the light hitting the body {{in a way that makes}} you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> your man". Danyel Smith, editor for Time Inc. at the time, said [...] "It's so sexy. It's about time that girls had something luscious to look at while they're listening to a song. For years, men have been treated to breasts and butts along with their favorite songs, and women have had to just sit there and endure." [...] In an interview for The New York Times, Smith also said that she had encountered an appreciative reaction among women to the adult sexuality of the music video.

500|$|Scar has {{garnered}} widespread acclaim from film critics, {{some of whom}} praised him as {{a better}} character than Simba. Author Peter M.

[...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times called Scar a [...] "delectably wicked" [...] villain. Maslin went on to praise Irons' voice acting, writing that the actor [...] "slithers through the story in grandiose high style, with a green-eyed malevolence {{that is one of}} film's chief delights." [...] Leah Rozen of People described Scar as [...] "a flawless realization of Irons' special talent." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune lauded Scar as the film's [...] "best character," [...] jokingly describing him as [...] "Irons' Claus von Bulow with fur." [...] Similarly, ComingSoon.net's Joshua Starnes hailed Scar as [...] "the best part of the film." [...] Praising both Scar and Irons' acting, Starnes continued, [...] "He switches so quickly and easily from campy to deadly its like a showcase for how to do an over-the-top villain right." [...] Concluding that [...] "Villains are often the most memorable characters in a Disney animated film," [...] Roger Ebert described Scar [...] "one of the great ones." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews reviewed, [...] "Gone is the buffoonery that has marked the recent trio of Ursula, Gaston, and Jafar," [...] writing, [...] "Scar is a sinister figure, given to acid remarks and cunning villainy."

I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s." [...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that ever tried to take me down and didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." [...] She further clarified, commenting [...] "I will say this, my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people." ...|$|E
