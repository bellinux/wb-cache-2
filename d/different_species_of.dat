5|$|The best-known {{method of}} prey capture is {{by means of}} sticky webs. Varying {{placement}} of webs allows <b>different</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> spider to trap different insects in the same area, for example flat horizontal webs trap insects that fly up from vegetation underneath while flat vertical webs trap insects in horizontal flight. Web-building spiders have poor vision, but are extremely sensitive to vibrations.|$|E
5|$|The {{link between}} phylogenetic {{distance}} ("relatedness") and pathology is small, e.g. the O157:H7 serotype strains, which form a clade ("an exclusive group")—group E below—are all enterohaemorragic strains (EHEC), {{but not all}} EHEC strains are closely related. In fact, four <b>different</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> Shigella are nested among E. coli strains (vide supra), while E. albertii and E. fergusonii are outside this group.|$|E

Two way ANOVA test confirmed that all the chemical <b>species</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen did not show any significant variation in concentration among the different experimental ponds.

5|$|Aside {{from some}} papers {{published}} discussing myrmecophilous beetles and insect pests in forests, Clark predominately researched and published {{articles about the}} taxonomy of Australian ants.

He worked and researched {{with all of the}} main groups of Australian ants, but his research and revisionary efforts were extensive with members of the former subfamily Cerapachyinae (now Dorylinae), especially those of Phyracaces, the Myrmeciinae, Rhytidoponera and members of the tribe Dolichoderini.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{occupy a}} wide range of {{ecological}} positions. While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by <b>different</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. Avivores are animals that are specialised at preying on birds.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its initial}} plausibility, the {{identity}} theory faces a strong {{challenge in the}} form of the thesis of multiple realizability, first formulated by Hilary Putnam. It is obvious that not only humans, but many <b>different</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> animals can, for example, experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs {{have always}} been an {{extremely}} varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and {{the total number of}} genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around1850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. An earlier study predicted that about 3400dinosaur genera existed, including many {{that would not have been}} preserved in the fossil record.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} advanced that the pervasive protein variation found in natural populations of many organisms is adaptively neutral, and thus {{not subject to}} natural selection. This neutrality hypothesis predicts that at polymorphic gene loci different configurations of allelic frequencies will occur in <b>different</b> <b>species.</b> Results <b>of</b> an extensive study of protein variation in several <b>species</b> <b>of</b> Drosophila show that any two species have very similar allelic frequencies at a substantial proportion of all gene loci, while at many other loci the <b>species</b> have very <b>different</b> sets of alleles. Genetic distances have been calculated between pairs of subspecies, morphologically similar <b>species,</b> and morphologically <b>different</b> <b>species.</b> The distribution <b>of</b> genetic distances is strikingly different from the predictions of the neutrality theory. Protein variation appears to be maintained by natural selection...|$|R
