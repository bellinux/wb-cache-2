5000|$|The {{antidote}} to forgetting the instructions is mindfulness -- in particular, remembering. We {{need to remind}} ourselves continuously of the details. If you have forgotten {{what you are doing}} with your mind, almost inevitably, you've also forgotten what you are doing with your body. Start by remembering your posture. Is your spine still upright? Are you relaxed, or are you <b>holding</b> <b>tension</b> in your shoulders and arms? What are you doing with your gaze? Simply checking your posture and starting your meditation over -- [...] "Now I'm placing my mind on my breath" [...] -- can be the most direct way to invoke the instructions when you've forgotten {{in the middle of a}} session.|$|E
5000|$|Transformative jazz pianist George Shearing {{recorded}} the piece in 1977 for his album, also titled 500 Miles High. It is featured alongside mostly bebop jazz standards, {{making it the}} sole contemporary tune on the album. In 2009, the Manhattan Transfer interpreted the song for their tribute album, The Chick Corea Songbook. Nastos describes it as [...] "the most well-revered '500 Miles High,' as rich angelic voices reach for the heavens in wordless refrains <b>holding</b> <b>tension</b> and a modicum of energy, again quite unlike the initial famous version done by Return to Forever with Purim." [...] Other recordings include those by Joe Pass (Virtuoso No. 2, 1976), Azymuth (Outubro, 1980), and Joe Farrell (Sound of Jazz, 1988), who played saxophone on the original with Return to Forever.|$|E
5000|$|Christopher Bahn of The A.V. Club {{wrote that}} The Daleks is [...] "quite solid, full of well-paced action and some {{interestingly}} subtle characterizations, though it definitely begins to drag around the fifth episode, {{with a long}} trek through swamps and caverns that moves the plot forward by about an inch". Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern praised the strength of Nation's script, especially the first three cliffhangers. However, he felt that [...] "the urgency and claustrophobia dissipate towards the end", with the final battle being [...] "a disappointingly limp affair". DVD Talk's John Sinnott, despite noting that [...] "there are a few parts that drag just a bit", commended the script for <b>holding</b> <b>tension</b> unlike in An Unearthly Child and allowing the characters to develop. Sinnott also commented that the serial made the Daleks scary despite what they would become later. In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger of the first episode among the show's greatest cliffhangers.|$|E

50|$|As {{a type of}} binding knot, the jamming knot is {{good for}} {{constricting}} a bundle of objects such as sticks or brush. It is basically a taut-line hitch but the initial two wraps are {{on the outside of}} the working line rather than on the inside, and finished off with one wrap on the inside. Thus the knot <b>holds</b> <b>tension</b> towards the inside of the loop rather than the standing end of the rope as with the taut-line - turning a tension knot into a constricting knot. After the knot is tied, the knot is held with one hand, the standing end is pulled tight, and the knot should hold fast. This knot, as with the taut-line, can be difficult or impossible to tie on slick or particularly stiff rope.|$|R

50|$|Although Gao {{made him}} emperor, Emperor Xiaowu also almost {{immediately}} {{tried to do}} what he could to avoid being controlled by Gao. Although he married Gao's oldest daughter as his empress around the new year 533, he, after initially appearing to show deference to Gao, began to rule with Husi Chun and his associate Wang Sizheng (王思政) as his assistants, making decisions contrary to Gao's opinion, particularly after Gao had defeated the final major member of the Erzhu clan, Erzhu Zhao. He secretly communicated with Heba Yue (賀拔岳), who controlled the western provinces, and also commissioned Heba Yue's brother Heba Sheng (賀拔勝) as the commander of the southern provinces, wanting to depend on the Heba brothers to resist Gao's <b>hold.</b> <b>Tensions</b> also increased over Gao's desire to control more provinces and Emperor Xiaowu's corresponding desire to wrest control of the provinces from Gao.|$|R

Her left arm will lie above the man's right arm with no space between them, but she will not <b>hold</b> <b>tension</b> in that arm—he should barely feel the weight of her arm. The two faces may touch, they will at least be very close. With a straight back she leans against her partner at a more pronounced angle than his; he leans slightly toward her but may appear to be standing upright. Rhythmically, the two will indulge in small adornments with the feet until just before the next beat, changing weight at the last possible moment.|$|R
5000|$|Feed-Roller: This {{actually}} {{is the first}} patented method used in the semi-automatic label dispenser to advance the label forward. The label material is fed over the peeling edge, then through a feed-roller assembly which pinches the label material between a metal roller and a rubber roller. The metal roller is held in place with bushings pressed into aluminum blocks which hinge on a rod supported between two sideframes. The blocks use springs on each side to <b>hold</b> <b>tension</b> against the rubber roller (driven by a motor), and this also holds the tracking of the label material {{to the side of}} the machine with the sensor. Using this method label stock up to 16" [...] width can be advanced and tracked perfectly. The disadvantage/advantage to this method is waste is not collected, but pushed out through the rear of the machine where it can be fed into a trash receptacle.|$|R

5000|$|Multi-filament strings, known {{commonly}} as [...] "multis" [...] are strings {{that have}} more than one filament. They are most commonly made of many filaments of nylon, but can incorporate other materials such as polyurethane, Zyex, Vectran, Kevlar, and other materials. Multi-filament strings offer better elasticity than single filament strings, but usually inferior durability. No multi-filament string <b>holds</b> its <b>tension</b> as well as natural gut, and none of them is as soft.|$|R

50|$|In its {{earliest}} form, the capstan {{consisted of a}} timber mounted vertically through a vessel's structure which was free to rotate. Levers, known as bars, were inserted through holes {{at the top of}} the timber and used to turn the capstan. A rope wrapped several turns around the drum was thus hauled upon. A rudimentary ratchet was provided to <b>hold</b> the <b>tension.</b> The ropes were always wound in a clockwise direction (seen from above).|$|R
5000|$|Synthetic gut, {{as it is}} {{used for}} mono-filament nylon strings, is now a misnomer, as the {{creation}} of multi-filament strings has provided players with a better approximation of natural gut's performance. Modern [...] "synthetic gut" [...] is actually a multi-filament string that <b>holds</b> its <b>tension</b> extremely well and which has a dynamic stiffness profile that is closest to natural gut, although the industry continues to apply the term to mono-filament nylon strings.|$|R

50|$|Mechanically drawn bows {{typically}} have a stock or other mounting, {{such as the}} crossbow. Crossbows {{typically have}} shorter draw lengths compared to compound bows. Because of this, heavier draw weights are required {{to achieve the same}} energy transfer to the arrow. These mechanically drawn bows also have devices to <b>hold</b> the <b>tension</b> when the bow is fully drawn. They are not limited by the strength of a single archer and larger varieties have been used as siege engines.|$|R
50|$|Over-center {{fasteners}} {{require a}} slightly more complex threading procedure to start the webbing through the fastener. The tensioning method provided by this fastener makes it easier than the cam fastener to get more tension into the strap and to keep it there. When the fastener is “open” you can feed the excess webbing through the fastener. When all of the slack is removed, the act of “closing” the fastener will add tension to the webbing and <b>hold</b> the <b>tension</b> tightly in place.|$|R

This discussion will range over the curious nature of this style, its virtues of concision and incisiveness, and what it might say about the “materiality” of language.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} processive movement of single myosin molecules from classes V and VI along their actin tracks has recently attracted extraordinary attention. Another {{member of the}} myosin superfamily, myosin VII, plays vital roles in the sensory function of Drosophila and mammals. We studied the molecular mechanism of Drosophila myosin VIIa, using transient kinetics and single-molecule motility assays. Myosin VIIa moves along actin filaments as a processive, double-headed single molecule when dimerized by {{the inclusion of a}} leucine zipper at the C terminus of the coiled-coil domain. Its motility is ≈ 8 – 10 times slower than that of myosin V, and its step size is 30 nm, which is consistent with the presence of five IQ motifs in its neck region. The kinetic basis for the processive motility of myosin VIIa is the relative magnitude of the release rate constants of phosphate (fast) and ADP (slow) as in myosins V and VI. The ATPase pathway is rate-limited by a reversible interconversion between two distinct ADP-bound actomyosin states, which results in high steady-state occupancy of a strongly actin-bound myosin species. The distinctive features of myosin VIIa (long run lengths, slow motility) will be very useful in video-based single-molecule applications. In cells, this kinetic behavior would allow myosin VIIa to exert and <b>hold</b> <b>tension</b> on actin filaments and, if dimerized, to function as a processive cargo transporter...|$|R

5000|$|A string is the {{vibrating}} {{element that}} produces sound in string instruments {{such as the}} guitar, harp, piano (piano wire), {{and members of the}} violin family. Strings are lengths of a flexible material that a musical instrument <b>holds</b> under <b>tension</b> so that they can vibrate freely, but controllably. Strings may be [...] "plain" [...] (consisting only of a single material, like steel, nylon, or gut). [...] "Wound" [...] strings have a [...] "core" [...] of one material, with an overwinding of other materials. This is to make the string vibrate at the desired pitch, while maintaining a low profile and sufficient flexibility for playability.|$|R

Vadim Rizov from Village Voice gave the film a positive review, praising the film's direction, performances, {{and its ability to}} <b>hold</b> its <b>tension</b> throughout its running time, calling it, [...] "an unflinching portrait of the grim vileness of Soviet Russia in 1984".

50|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} RC is concrete {{in which}} reinforcement bars ("rebars"), reinforcement grids, plates or fibers are embedded to create bond {{and thus to}} strengthen the concrete in tension. The composite material was invented by French gardener Joseph Monier in 1849 and patented in 1867. Conventionally the term Concrete refers only to concrete that is reinforced with iron or steel. However, other materials are often used to reinforce concrete e.g. organic and inorganic fibres, composites in different forms. While compared to its compressive strength, concrete is weak in tension. Thus adding reinforcement increases the strength in tension. The other purpose of providing reinforcement in concrete is to <b>hold</b> the <b>tension</b> cracked sections together.|$|R
50|$|With a {{crossbow}}, archers could {{release a}} draw force far {{in excess of}} what they could have handled with a bow. Furthermore, the crossbow could <b>hold</b> the <b>tension</b> for a long time, whereas even the strongest longbowman could only hold a drawn bow {{for a short period}} of time. The ease of use of a crossbow allows it to be used effectively with little training, while other types of bows take far more skill to shoot accurately. The disadvantage is the greater weight and clumsiness compared to a bow, as well as the slower rate of shooting and the lower efficiency of the acceleration system, but there would be reduced elastic hysteresis, making the crossbow a more accurate weapon.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to explore whether BNFK, which trains {{self-awareness}} and self-regulation of physiological and mental-emotional states, can enhance an athlete's psychological skills, specifically their ability to focus, relax and regulate their arousal and anxiety levels, and ultimately, enhance their sport performance. This research utilized a multiple-case study design. Six elite athletes, with a minimum of five years experience at the international or Olympic level, each received 30 hours of a BNFK training intervention. The effect of BNFK training was explored in three ways: (a) three phases of interviews were conducted with each athlete, prior to the BNFK training, between 20 - 30 hours of BNFK training, and at the end of the 2007 - 2008 competitive season; (b) physiological and neurological quantitative data was collected which measured improvements specific to the BNFK training; and (c) performance results were noted at the completion of the 2007 - 2008 competitive season and compared to previous results. The findings indicate that within the lab setting, the athletes developed (i) greater self-awareness of how they <b>hold</b> <b>tension</b> and anxiety in the body and (ii) self-regulation techniques to decrease that tension. As well, the athletes became more aware of their mental state, and through regulation of their level of anxiety and tension in the body, they enhanced their ability to focus. Although much improvement was seen, none of the athletes developed optimal self-regulation of all aspects measured. With respect to competition results, no definite improvement in performance was seen. The results of the study are further discussed in the context of the BNFK and sport psychology literature. Implications and future directions are also offered...|$|R
