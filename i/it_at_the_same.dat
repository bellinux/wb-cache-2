5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E
5|$|One {{month before}} the final task, Harry and Krum are talking when they {{encounter}} Crouch, who appears to have gone insane, but manages to tell Harry to get Dumbledore. Leaving Krum with Crouch, Harry fetches Dumbledore but returns to find Krum stunned and Crouch gone. Harry returns to preparing for the final task, a hedge maze. Inside the maze, Harry is forced to incapacitate Krum, who has been bewitched, to save Cedric. Working together, the two reach the cup. They agree to touch <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, and doing so, discover {{that it is a}} Portkey that transports them to a graveyard. There, Peter Pettigrew kills Cedric and uses Harry's blood (along with his own hand and Tom Riddle Sr.'s bone) to resurrect Lord Voldemort.|$|E
5|$|The first Curry Moor {{pumping station}} {{was built in}} 1864, to house a steam engine and pump. A cottage for the {{operator}} was built next to <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. This installation lasted until 1955, when a new pumphouse was constructed to house two diesel pumps. The steam engine was retained for historical reasons, and is located in {{part of the new}} building. The diesel pumps were supplemented by an electric pump in 1983, and a programme of refurbishment was carried out in 2008, which included {{the construction of a new}} outfall into the river.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} called a masterpiece depiction of a battle scene, and much more than a simple depiction of a bloody battle. It is a complex picture, requiring more than a cursory look; a French critic, viewing it in Paris in 1879, declared that it was a museum in its own right, requiring eight days of study before one could properly appreciate <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, critics have pointed to the unrealistic depiction of the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present in the painting. Others have criticized the painting for being too crowded and chaotic.|$|E

The diver ascends along the shotline, and may use it purely as a visual reference, or can hold on to it to positively control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used to fasten a diver to a shotline during a decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords' {{statement}} on parliamentary privilege {{was assessed by}} the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart, but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it. Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying that, where a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement {{can be used as}} evidence. However, there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; {{in the case of the}} Finance Act, for example, it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also feels, for whatever reason, that the provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about the separation of powers in the United Kingdom; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the executive, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, it violates this separation of powers, allowing the executive to make law.|$|E

25|$|Hemoglobin is {{involved}} in the transport of other gases: It carries some of the body's respiratory carbon dioxide (about 20â€“25% of the total) as carbaminohemoglobin, in which CO2 is bound to the globin protein. The molecule also carries the important regulatory molecule nitric oxide bound to a globin protein thiol group, releasing <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time as oxygen.|$|E

25|$|The Departed {{opened to}} {{widespread}} critical acclaim, with some proclaiming {{it as one}} of the best efforts Scorsese had brought to the screen since 1990s Goodfellas, and still others putting <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> level as Scorsese's most celebrated classics Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. With domestic box office receipts surpassing million, The Departed was Scorsese's highest-grossing film (not accounting for inflation) until 2010's Shutter Island.|$|E
25|$|On September 4, 1990, the new {{passenger}} terminal was opened and Air Ontario moved into <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, Air Ontario inaugurated daily service to London, Ontario. A 37-seat Dash 8 operated on the Toronto-London route, while a 50-seat Dash 8 operated on the routes to Montreal and Ottawa.

25|$|Nevertheless, the {{national}} service scheme was suspended in 1960, {{due to the}} large amount of resources required to administer <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, the introduction of the Pentropic divisional establishment saw the disbandment or amalgamation of many infantry battalions as regional-based battalions were formed into multi-battalion State-based regiments. This saw the adoption of the five battalion division and resulted in the disbandment of the old three battalion brigade formations.|$|E

25|$|An {{elementary}} {{theory of}} property, believed by many peasants, was that land should belong {{to those who}} work on <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, peasant life and culture was changing constantly.

25|$|Those years accentuated his {{conflict}} with Cuza: in October 1909, when {{he planned to}} speak at university about the execution of Francisco Ferrer by the Spanish restoration government, his address was violently interrupted by far-right students. In 1911, he reportedly refused to be granted the Bene-Merenti medal by King Carol I, because Cuza, suspected of plagiarism, was also a recipient; however, he later was created Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown, being received into <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time as Cuza, who was appointed Commander.|$|E

From 1968 onward, {{with the help of his}} brother Jimmy and later his girlfriend Althea Leasure, he opened Hustler Clubs in Akron, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, and Toledo, Ohio. Soon each club grossed between $260,000 and $520,000 a year. He also {{acquired}} the Dayton franchise of a small newspaper called Bachelor's Beat, which he published for two years before selling <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, he closed a money-losing vending-machine business.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the first}} to study quantum {{phenomena}} in nature were Arthur Compton, C. V. Raman, and Pieter Zeeman, each of whom has a quantum effect named after him. Robert Andrews Millikan studied the photoelectric effect experimentally, and Albert Einstein developed a theory for <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, Ernest Rutherford experimentally discovered the nuclear model of the atom, for which Niels Bohr developed his theory of the atomic structure, which was later confirmed by the experiments of Henry Moseley. In 1913, Peter Debye extended Niels Bohr's theory of atomic structure, introducing elliptical orbits, a concept also introduced by Arnold Sommerfeld. This phase is known as old quantum theory.|$|E
25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band.|$|E
25|$|The {{process that}} leads to the {{formation}} of a bait ball typically starts when predators locate a fish school deep below the surface. The predators make rushes and use various scare tactics to force the fish school to the surface, herding <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time into a compact volume. The alarmed fish, trapped against the surface above and surrounded all about, abandon their coordinated schooling movements and become chaotic. Their graceful and disciplined schooling strategies of uniform spacing and polarity degrade into frenetic attempts by each fish to save itself. In this way, a dense bait ball forms as each fish scrambles {{to get away from the}} surface of the ball and hide in the interior. The symmetry of this centripetal action forms a sphere, the shape with the minimum surface area for a given volume, thereby exposing the fewest number of fish on the surface to the predators. The movement, sound and smell can attract more predators, including different predator species, until there is a carousel of them, each species using its own characteristic predatory strategies. Fish that break loose are singled out and eaten. A frenzy can develop as predators compete, the water reddening with blood as shredded flesh and scales drift to the depths. As the bait ball reduces in size and number, it becomes progressively easier for the predators to target the survivors.|$|E
