25|$|In 1959, Cruyff's {{father died}} from a heart attack. His father's death had {{a major impact on}} his mentality. As Cruyff recalled, in celebration of his 50th birthday, “My father <b>died</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just 12 and he was 45. From that day the feeling crept {{stronger}} over me that I would die at the same age and, when I had serious heart problems when I reached 45, I thought: 'This is it.' Only medical science, which was not available to help my father, kept me alive.” Viewing a potential football career as a way of paying tribute to his father, the death inspired the strong-willed Cruyff, who also frequently visited the burial site at Oosterbegraafplaats. His mother began working at Ajax as a cleaner, deciding that she could no longer carry on at the grocer without her husband, and in the future, this made Cruyff near-obsessed with financial security but also gave him an appreciation for player aids. His mother soon met her second husband, Henk Angel, a field hand at Ajax who proved a key influence in Cruyff's life.|$|E
2500|$|Return of the Jedi, {{the final}} {{film in the}} {{original}} trilogy, alludes to the character. While in the Ewok village on the forest moon of Endor, Luke Skywalker asked if Leia Organa remembers their [...] "real mother". Leia answers that [...] "she <b>died</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very young" [...] and also says that [...] "she was very beautiful... kind... but sad" [...] while Luke confesses to have no memories of their mother. In an extended scene of Return of the Jedi, when Obi-Wan Kenobi talks to Luke he explains in detail {{what happened to his}} mother. It differs from the prequels in that Luke and Leia's mother snuck away as a handmaiden of Bail Organa and was with Leia until the Princess turned four, making the line Leia says to Luke about remembering their mother more believable.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a speech}} at the 1999 Berlin Film Festival, Zimmer stated that he is Jewish, and talked about his mother {{surviving}} the war thanks to her escape from Germany to England in 1939. In an interview with Mashable in February 2013, he said of his parents [...] "My mother was very musical, basically a musician and my father was an engineer and an inventor. So, I grew up modifying the piano, shall we say, which made my mother gasp in horror, and my father would think it was fantastic when I would attach chainsaws and stuff like that to the piano because he thought it was an evolution in technology." [...] In an interview with the German television station ZDF in 2006, he commented: [...] "My father <b>died</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just a child, and I escaped somehow into the music and music has been my best friend." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ullman credits {{her sense}} of humour to a feeling of both classlessness {{as well as her}} mother's working class roots. [...] "It comes from being classless, I think. My father was Polish and he <b>died</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> six. And from being a little girl who went to gymkhana and had ponies, and went to a private school, and lived in a big house we {{suddenly}} didn’t have any money any more and had to go to a state school. And my mother’s family is all from South London, {{and we have a lot}} of uncles and friends over there. And when my father died they were very supportive, and they used to come down for the weekend - all these hordes of South London oiks. They used to invade our big Posh Bucks home and use the swimming pool, ride the ponies, and they were so funny these blokes; they really affected my sense of humour ... But I think the man who really affected my sense of humour was my uncle Butch, he was called Butch Castle. He was a decorator from South London - lazy old sod. [...] An he’s got the sharpest mind I’ve ever known; he’s so hysterically funny. And I wanted to be like him." ...|$|E
2500|$|While the {{cartoons}} {{proved to be}} very popular and were soon syndicated in the United States and overseas, being published in newspapers in fifty countries world-wide, Roberto's company had closed down and the couple [...] "found themselves living in the US illegally, 'trying to find jobs that would keep us {{one step ahead of}} the Immigration Department'". By 1971 they had travelled to New Zealand, where they were married on 24 July 1971 at St. Andrew's Church, Epsom, Auckland – the same church in which her parents were married in 1936. Casali wore a crown of daisies and a shoulder-length veil that she had previously drawn on 'her' character in the cartoon. Casali said of the marriage: [...] "My father had <b>died</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> young, so when Roberto asked me to get married I agreed, but said, 'Whatever you do, don't die on me.' He laughed and promised to stick around." [...] In January 1972, with Love is... by now a successful and lucrative product licensed for reproduction on mugs, T-shirts, calendars, posters and greetings cards, they moved to Weybridge, England, and bought a second home in Los Angeles. At the height of their popularity in the 1970s, {{the cartoons}} were earning Casali £4–5 million annually.|$|E

The remainder of 2013 proved very difficult for him, and he later explained: [...] "Well, it was another turning point. It {{made me think of}} a lot of things.
