5|$|After {{the first}} Brazilian dreadnought, Minas Geraes, was launched, the Brazilian {{government}} began an extended campaign {{to remove the}} third dreadnought from the contract because of political—backlash from the Revolt of the Lash coupled with warming relations with Argentina—and economic reasons. After much negotiating and attempts from Armstrong to hold the Brazilian <b>government</b> <b>to</b> the contract, the Brazilians relented, {{due in part to}} lower bond rates that made it possible for the <b>government</b> <b>to</b> borrow the necessary money.

50|$|The {{convention}} merely {{reaffirmed the}} statute adopted {{few days earlier}} at a League of Nations conference held in Barcelona. Article 1 of the statute defined transit as movement of persons and goods from one sovereign state to another. Article 2 recognized the freedom of sovereign <b>governments</b> <b>to</b> make transit arrangements within their territories. Article 3 prohibited governments from demanding payments for transit rights, except for dues designated to cover operational expenses. Article 4 made compulsory for <b>governments</b> <b>to</b> apply equal transit dues to all persons, regardless of nationality. Article 5 permitted <b>governments</b> <b>to</b> prevent the entry into their territories of certain persons or goods for reasons of security. Article 6 permitted <b>governments</b> <b>to</b> refrain from granting transit permission to persons of states that were non-signatories of the convention. Article 7 permitted <b>governments</b> <b>to</b> deviate from {{the provisions of the}} statute in cases of national emergency, but required this be done for as brief period as possible. Article 8 allowed exceptions in times of war. Article 9 stated that none of its provisions can contradict obligations of states within the League of Nations. Article 10 stated that the statute shall replace all other transit agreements concluded prior to 1 May 1921. Article 11 permitted <b>governments</b> <b>to</b> grant greater freedoms of transit than provided in the statute, if they chose to do so. Article 12 permitted <b>governments</b> <b>to</b> postpone temporarily the applications of the transit provisions in case their territory or parts of it still suffered from the devastation caused by the First World War. Article 13 provided for resolution of disputes regarding interpretation through the Permanent Court of International Justice. Article 14 permitted <b>governments</b> <b>to</b> refrain from applying reasonable transit provisions to territories that were either under populated or lacking in proper arrangements of the rule of law. Article 15 stated that different arrangements shall apply in League of Nations mandated territories.|$|R

5|$|As {{commerce}} and industry flourished {{on the lower}} river, most of the original settlers acquired farms in the upper Willamette Valley. By the late 1850s, farmers had begun to grow crops {{on most of the}} available fertile land. The settlers increasingly encroached on Native American lands. Skirmishes between natives and settlers in the Umpqua and Rogue valleys to the southwest of the Willamette River led the Oregon state <b>government</b> <b>to</b> remove the natives by military force. They were first led off their traditional lands to the Willamette Valley, but soon were marched to the Coast Indian Reservation. In 1855, Joel Palmer, an Oregon legislator, negotiated a treaty with the Willamette Valley tribes, who, although unhappy with the treaty, ceded their lands to non-natives. The natives were then relocated by the <b>government</b> <b>to</b> a part of the Coast Reservation that later became the Grande Ronde Reservation.|$|E

5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the <b>government</b> <b>to</b> expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the <b>government</b> <b>to</b> instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E
