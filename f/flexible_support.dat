6000|$|Solanum dulcamara {{is one of}} the feeblest and {{poorest of}} twiners: it may often be seen growing as an upright bush, and when growing {{in the midst of a}} thicket merely scrambles up between the {{branches}} without twining; but when, according to Dutrochet (tom. xix. p. 299), it grows near a thin and <b>flexible</b> <b>support,</b> such as the stem of a nettle, it twines round it. I placed sticks round several plants, and vertically stretched strings close to others, and the strings alone were ascended by twining. The stem twines indifferently to the right or left. Some others species of Solanum, and of another genus, viz. Habrothamnus, belonging to the same family, are described in horticultural works as twining plants, but they seem to possess this faculty in a very feeble degree. We may suspect that the species of these two genera have as yet only partially acquired the habit of twining. On the other hand with Tecoma radicans, a member of a family abounding with twiners and tendril-bearers, but which climbs, like the ivy, by the aid of rootlets, we may suspect that a former habit of twining has been lost, for the stem exhibited slight irregular movements which could hardly be accounted for by changes in the action of the light. There is no difficulty in understanding how a spirally twining plant could graduate into a simple root-climber; for the young internodes of Bignonia Tweedyana and of Hoya carnosa revolve and twine, but likewise emit rootlets which adhere to any fitting surface, so that the loss of twining would be no great disadvantage and in some respects an advantage to these species, as they would then ascend their supports in a more direct line. {20} ...|$|E

Using speed-combined method, the random speed model of wind was established {{and the wind}} loading was obtained. The helical gear system model of wind turbine was built under <b>flexible</b> <b>supporting</b> of the tower. The vibration displacement responses of each shaft were simulated and compared with response under rigid supporting. The results shows that the amplitude of vibration displacements under <b>flexible</b> <b>supporting</b> are generally higher {{and closer to the}} actual working condition, and considering the effects of <b>flexible</b> <b>supporting</b> of tower on system is necessary to the dynamic analysis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive numerical procedure {{to treat the}} blast response of laminated glass (LG) panels and investigates the effects of two important parameters: the negative phase of the blast loading and support flexibility on the blast performance of LG. The influence of the negative phase is examined on the blast response of LG panels fixed to rigid and <b>flexible</b> <b>supports.</b> Findings indicate that the negative phase has negligible impact on the centre deflection, energy absorption and the support reactions of LG panels with rigid supports while it has significant impact on those with <b>flexible</b> <b>supports.</b> The support flexibility is varied by changing the cross-section dimensions of the steel cables used with the <b>flexible</b> <b>supports.</b> Results show that blast performance of flexible facades can be further improved by using steel cables with smaller cross-sections as they increase the energy absorption while reducing reaction forces at the steel cables. <b>Flexible</b> <b>supports</b> seem to delay the failure of LG panels which {{are more likely to}} fail after dissipation of the blast pressure and hence reduce the injuries occurring from direct blast pressure and the broken glass fragments. The new information generated in this paper will therefore encourage engineers to come up with innovative flexible façade systems which will minimise the hazards from potential near field explosions...|$|R

40|$|A <b>flexible</b> <b>supporting</b> {{structure}} that reduces seismic response of an arch is proposed. Topology and cross-sectional {{areas of the}} supporting structure modeled as a truss structure are optimized through two steps of static and dynamic optimization problems. In the first step, a <b>flexible</b> <b>supporting</b> {{structure that}} has diagonal displacement at the top under horizontal load is obtained by solving static optimization problems. Then, in the second step, the cross-sectional area of the flexible member is optimized to minimize the seismic response acceleration of the arch evaluated by the complete quadratic combination (CQC) method. Time-history seismic response analysis is carried out {{to show that the}} response in the normal direction of the roof successfully decreases due to flexibility of the supporting structure; in addition, installing passive energy dissipation devices into the <b>flexible</b> <b>supporting</b> structure is very effective in reducing the tangential response of the arch...|$|R
40|$|In {{structural}} engineering ceilings affect both the building technique {{and the economic}} construction. Using precast prestressed hollow core slabs meets the demands of modern design and construction to a high extent. However, the shear resistance of hollow core slabs is considerably reduced if the slabs are bedded on slender beams or girders instead of rigid walls. According to investigations in Finland stresses in transverse direction of the slabs due to <b>flexible</b> <b>supports</b> {{may lead to a}} decrease in shear resistance of up to 60 %. The reduction in shear resistance depends on the composite action between the beam and the slabs, the beam deflection and the slabs’ cross section. No generally accepted design model allowing for a standardised and accurate shear design of prestressed hollow core slabs has been established in Europe so far. Further¬more, the differentiation between rigid and <b>flexible</b> <b>supports</b> is often not clear. Uncertainties in the design and open questions regarding the load bearing behaviour on <b>flexible</b> <b>supports</b> in general limit the application of prestressed hollow core slabs. The aim of the present thesis is a thorough analysis of the load bearing behaviour of prestressed hollow core slabs on <b>flexible</b> <b>supports.</b> At first, {{the state of the art}} is summarised. Own experimental and numerical investigations on vital parameters affecting the load bearing behaviour are described in the following. The experimental investigations comprise eight full-scale tests on two-span floor systems with <b>flexible</b> <b>supports</b> and accompanying reference tests on single slabs with rigid supports. Continuative three-dimensional nonlinear FE-analyses provide deep insight into the failure mechanism and the influence of the beam’s bending stiffness on the load bearing behaviour. Based on the experimental and numerical results measures to enhance the shear resistance can be evaluated. A database of international tests with prestressed hollow core slabs on <b>flexible</b> <b>supports</b> from literature is generated to develop a realistic design model for shear. After evaluating the data an existing design model from Finland is used to recalculate the existing tests. An own design model is derived in the next step, whereas especially findings regarding the slabs’ load bearing behaviour and their composite action with the beam at the ultimate limit state are considered. Based on the results of 21 full-scale tests with different types of beams and slabs as well as a parametric study the own model is validated. It accounts for all important factors affecting the load bearing behaviour and hence contributes to an accurate and safe design of prestressed hollow core slabs on <b>flexible</b> <b>supports...</b>|$|R

40|$|Normally, the {{boundaries}} {{are assumed to}} allow small deflections and moments for MEMS beams with <b>flexible</b> <b>supports.</b> The non-ideal boundary conditions {{have a significant effect}} on the qualitative dynamical behavior. In this paper, by employing the principle of energy equivalence, rigorous theoretical solutions of the tangential and rotational equivalent stiffness are derived based on the Boussinesq’s and Cerruti’s displacement equations. The non-dimensional differential partial equation of the motion, as well as coupled boundary conditions, are solved analytically using the method of multiple time scales. The closed-form solution provides a direct insight into the relationship between the boundary conditions and vibration characteristics of the dynamic system, in which resonance frequencies increase with the nonlinear mechanical spring effect but decrease with the effect of <b>flexible</b> <b>supports.</b> The obtained results of frequencies and mode shapes are compared with the cases of ideal boundary conditions, and the differences between them are contrasted on frequency response curves. The influences of the support material property on the equivalent stiffness and resonance frequency shift are also discussed. It is demonstrated that the proposed model with the <b>flexible</b> <b>supports</b> boundary conditions has significant effect on the rigorous quantitative dynamical analysis of the MEMS beams. Moreover, the proposed analytical solutions are in good agreement with those obtained from finite element analyses...|$|R
