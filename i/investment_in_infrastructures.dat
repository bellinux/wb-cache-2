The country was later incorporated as {{the province of}} Indonesia afterwards. During the subsequent two-decade occupation, a campaign of pacification ensued. Although Indonesia did make substantial <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructures</b> during its occupation in East Timor, dissatisfaction remained widespread. Between 1975 and 1999, there were an estimated about 102,800 conflict-related deaths (approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness), the majority of which occurred during the Indonesian occupation.|$|E

The estimated parameters for the investment determinants allow us to calculate a needs index, which reveals (and quantifies) : first, {{the existence of a}} trade-off between equity and efficiency for the different levels of government when deciding public investments in infrastructures, and second, the importance on including additional (to GDP and population) need variables to calculate a territorial distribution rule of public <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Infrastructures, investment needs, public investment. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse {{productive}} efficiency behaviour in the 15 European Union Member States (EU) from 1980 to 2001. To carry out this research, a stochastic frontier model has been used, making it possible to study the role of public <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and education. We introduce these capitals in the function to be estimated and take into consideration allocation criteria in European countries as determinants of productive efficiency. Findings confirm the positive influence of public capital on production and the investment effort in education on the improvement of efficiency, as well as the existence of a technological catch-up effect among countries. ...|$|E
30|$|Proteins {{are major}} executors of life processes, {{carrying}} out essential and nonessential functions {{inside and outside}} of the cell, in species ranging from simple unicellular organisms to mammals. Thus, not surprisingly, studies of structure and function of proteins span the entire spectrum of molecular biology and modern biomedical sciences in general. Due to historical reasons, protein science research in China was isolated and limited in scope until late 1970 s. In the last two decades, China has seen an outburst of research activities, government initiatives, and aggregation of human talents in protein science research. This article provides an overview of major initiatives in research funding, <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> and research forces for protein science research in China.|$|E

As is usual, the stock of public infrastructures has {{a positive effect on}} the total factor productivity. However, as main contribution of the paper, we assume that this effect depends on the effective endowment of infrastructures. In particular, we assume that there are diminishing returns to scale at the private level {{as a consequence of the}} existence of transport costs, which negatively depend on the stock of infrastructures per unit of output.

We find that the ethnic minority now constitute {{more than a half}} of the poor population, though they account for around 14. 5 percent of the population,. The share of the poor ethnic minorities in the total poor has steadily increased from 18 percent in the early 1990 s up to 56 percent recently. Our decomposition analysis shows that differences in characteristics could explain as much as one third of the income gap between the majority and all other ethnic minorities groups. Importantly, it implies that poverty of the ethnic minorities cannot be solved simply by <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and public services. This suggests an awaking alarm for the focus on provision of basic infrastructure and public services emphasized in most of the current policies and programmes for ethnic minorities. ...|$|E

Under a widely used class of utility functions, we show that in bad times the government should: (i) lower the tax rate on labor income, (ii) lower the tax rate on capital income; and (iii) increase spending (or <b>investment)</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Quantitatively, following a one-standard deviation negative productivity shock, the tax break amounts to 0. 45 % of GDP and government spending increases by 0. 62 % of GDP.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{evolution}} of production by sector in 38 countries of Africa, during the period 2000 - 2005. Although {{there have been some}} improvements in a few African countries, we notice that, unfortunately, little progress has been reached regarding industrial production per capita in the majority of the African countries. International cooperation to development should be addressed not only to social programs related with education, health and other basic conditions for wellbeing but also to foster investment in industrial sector because it has positive impacts on economic development, not only due to its direct effect but also important indirect effects which increase production of services and other non industrial sectors, as well as foreign trade. International cooperation for <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> industry, education and other important factors of production needs support, not only from non profit organizations and institutional donors but also from individual savings and business companies.

40|$|To achieve both {{sustainable}} {{economic growth}} and a reduction of CO 2 emissions {{has been an important}} policy agenda in recent years. Although efficiency in energy consumption in the manufacturing sector has been significantly improving, energy consumption in the service and household sectors continues to increase steadily. Currently, the service industry accounts for about 20 % of final energy use in Japan. This paper, by using establishment-level micro-data from the Energy Consumption Survey, empirically analyzes the effect of urban density on energy intensity in the service sector. According to the analysis, the efficiency of energy consumption in service establishments is higher for densely populated cities. Quantitatively, after controlling for differences among industries, energy efficiency increases by about 12 % when the density in municipality populations doubles. The result suggests that, under the trend towards the service economy, deregulation of excessive restrictions hindering urban agglomeration, <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in the city centers, and expansion of clean energy supply in the rural areas would contribute to environmentally friendly economic growth. ...|$|E

We decompose the poverty and macroeconomic {{impacts of the}} major economic policies led in Cameroon during this period (<b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> devaluation, and enforcement of Value-Added Tax), {{in order to assess}} the intrinsic contribution of those policies taken individually. In this regard, we use the so-called Double-Calibration technique, within a Microsimulation CGE framework. As a result, the technological changes arisen between 1993 and 2001 explain alone: up to 31 percent the nationwide poverty alleviation (FGT 0), 45 percent of the GDP growth, and 4 percent of the rise in consumer price index. The contribution of considered policies: the devaluation of the CFA franc, the rehabilitation of infrastructures, and the customs and tax reform, are respectively two percent, 9 percent and 4 percent in poverty alleviation (FGT 0 index); one percent, 11 percent, and three percent in explaining GDP growth; and 65 percent, zero percent and 11 percent in {{explaining the}} rise in consumer price index...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the relationship between}} tourism and economic growth for Latin American countries since 1985 until 1998. The analysis proposed {{is based on a}} panel data approach and the Arellano-Bond estimator for dynamic panels. We obtain estimates of the relationship between economic growth and growth in tourists per capita conditional on main macroeconomic variables. We show that the tourism sector is adequate for the economic growth of medium or low-income countries, though not necessarily for developed countries. We then invert the causality direction of the analysis. Rather than explaining economic growth, we try to explain tourism arrivals conditional on GDP and other covariates such as safety, prices and education level, and <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> We employ a generalised least squares AR(1) panel data model. The results provide evidence that low-income countries seem to need adequate levels of infrastructures, education and development to attract tourists. Medium-income countries need high levels of social development like health services and high GDP per capita levels. Finally, the results disclose that price of the destination, in terms of exchange rate and PPP is irrelevant for tourism growth. Tourism, Economic growth, Panel data...|$|E
