5|$|In 1996, the {{military}} rulers in Burma undertook renovation {{work on the}} Mahamuni Pagoda. During this period, the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared {{in the belly of}} the Great Image. It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole in an attempt to steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image. It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night, resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter. Whilst the meeting was in progress, attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist <b>girl.</b> <b>A</b> major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not been raped at all. It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha so it could be repaired. However, the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2004, Trisha {{played the}} role of a {{helpless}} <b>girl</b> <b>a</b> kabaddi player tries to save from a corrupt politician who wants to marry her in Ghilli.

The Telugu romantic comedy Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana (2005) featured Trisha as a village girl and was a commercial success. It earned her another Filmfare Award and her first Nandi Award for Best Actress. She reprised the role in the Tamil remake Unakkum Enakkum (2006) which was also successful. Selvaraghavan's Telugu film Aadavari Matalaku Arthale Verule (2007) won Trisha her third Filmfare Award. The same year she featured opposite Ajith Kumar in A. L.

5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. According to an advertisement for the film, the plot was written especially for Marie Eline, {{also known as the}} Thanhouser Kid, as a feature which would show her abilities. Eline's role and actions were described in a deus ex machina fashion by The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer because of her actions to guide and assist her blind sister. Though, Lonergan liked to use the dramatic technique in the conclusion of the plots, it was not like the usage in The Actor's Children. It is also not the most striking example of the technique, in The Restoration the runaway child picks a doorstep to rest upon in a city, at complete random, is taken in by a recently engaged wealthy woman and reunited with her amnesia-struck father. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Cast in the starring role is Marie Eline as the little <b>girl.</b> <b>A</b> surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying two more actors in the production. The other credits amongst the cast are unknown, but most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions.|$|E
