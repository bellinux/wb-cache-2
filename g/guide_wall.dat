These mules are used for side-to-side and braking control in the locks, which are narrow relative to modern-day ships. Forward motion into and through the locks is actually provided by the ship's engines and not the mules. A ship approaching the locks first {{pulls up to the}} <b>guide</b> <b>wall,</b> which is an extension of the centre wall of the locks, where it is taken under control by the mules on the wall before proceeding into the lock. As it moves forward, additional lines are taken to mules on the other wall. With large ships, there are two mules on each side at the bow, and two each side at the stern—eight in total, allowing for precise control of the ship.|$|E

The TFCF functions to prevent fish entrainment at the Tracy Pumping Plant. The TFCF collects fish that are {{then returned to the}} Delta. To achieve efficient fish collection, velocity fields should be generated that are uniform and that supply well directed guidance to the bypass entrance. In the first phase of this study, modeling was used to develop low maintenance internal features of the bypass entrance that generated near-uniform internal velocity distributions (Kubitschek 2003). This second phase study focused on extending the 1 : 3 model findings to the approach flow. Study findings show that velocity distributions {{in the vicinity of the}} bypass entrance are influenced by approach flow velocity distributions. This may imply that the TFCF trashracks and louvers should be maintained clean to sustain uniform velocity fields approaching and entering the intakes. Findings also show that by adding a minor flow restriction to the backside of the louver immediately adjacent to the bypass entrances, a local through louver high velocity zone can be eliminated which should improve fish guidance to the bypass intake. Finally, findings show that acceptable passing flow and bypass entrance hydraulics can be maintained with the bypass <b>guide</b> <b>wall</b> removed.

The results indicate that field vibrations caused by flood discharge have distinctive characteristics of constancy, low frequency, small amplitude, and randomness with impact, which significantly differ from the common high-frequency vibration characteristics. Field vibrations have a main frequency of about 0. 5 – 3. 0  Hz and the characteristics of long propagation distance and large-scale impact. The vibration of a stilling basin slab runs mainly in the vertical direction. The vibration response of the <b>guide</b> <b>wall</b> perpendicular to the flow is significantly stronger than it is in other directions and decreases linearly downstream along the <b>guide</b> <b>wall.</b> The vibration response of the underground turbine floor is mainly caused by the load of unit operation. Urban environmental vibration has particular distribution characteristics and change patterns, and is greatly affected by discharge, scheduling modes, and geological conditions. Along with the increase of the height of residential buildings, vibration responses show a significant amplification effect. The horizontal and vertical vibrations of the 7 th floor are, respectively, about 6 times and 1. 5 times stronger than the corresponding vibrations of the 1 st floor. The vibration of a large-scale chemical plant presents the combined action of flood discharge and working machines.

An experimental study was led to check the good behaviour of the hydraulic structures during high return period floods. The present paper focuses on the gated spillway analyzing the flow behaviour from upstream towards downstream. The gated spillway is oriented at 45 ° from the axis of the valley, creating a non uniform approach flow in the left bay of the gated spillway, with apparition of longitudinal vortex close to the left <b>guide</b> <b>wall.</b> To avoid these bad entry conditions, a vertical inclination of the left side wall reveals efficient to distribute uniformly the flow.

40|$|Acoustic Doppler current {{profilers}} (ADCPs) {{were used}} to measure water velocities in the tailrace at John Day Dam over a two-week period in February 2005. Data were collected by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the Hydraulic Design Section, Portland District, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The objective of this project was therefore to collect field measurements of water velocities in the near-field draft tube exit zone {{as well as the}} far-field tailrace to be used for improving these models. Field data were collected during the project using five separate ADCPs. Mobile ADCP data were collected using two ADCPs mounted on two separate boats. Data were collected by either holding the boat on-station at pre-defined locations for approximately 10 minutes or in moving transect mode when the boat would move over large distances during the data collection. Results from the mobile ADCP survey indicated a complex hydrodynamic flow field in the tailrace downstream of John Day Dam. A large gyre was noted between the skeleton section of the powerhouse and non-spilling portion of the spillway. Downstream of the spillway, the spillway flow is constrained against the navigation lock <b>guide</b> <b>wall,</b> and large velocities were noted in this region. Downstream of the <b>guide</b> <b>wall,</b> velocities decreased as the spillway jet dispersed. Near the tailrace island, the flow split was measured to be approximately equal on Day 2 (25. 4 kcfs spillway/ 123 kcfs total). However, approximately 60 % of the flow passed along the south shore of the island on Day 1 (15. 0 kcfs spillway/ 150 kcfs total). At a distance of 9000 ft downstream of the dam, flows had equalized laterally and were generally uniform over the cross section. The collection of water velocities near the draft tube exit of an operating turbine unit is not routine, and equipment capable of measuring 3 D water velocities in these zones are at the forefront of hydraulic measurement technology. Although the feasibility of measuring 1 D water velocity magnitudes has been previously demonstrated by the authors, the feasibility of resolving 3 D water velocity vectors given the heterogeneity of the flow field was unknown before this study’s data were collected. Both the 1 D and 3 D data were collected by deploying three ADCPs on dual-axis rotators directly above the draft tube exit of Turbine Unit 16. These instruments collected 1 D data during both the mobile reconnaissance campaign and a later one-week period with zero spillway discharge. During the zero spillway discharge period, Turbine Unit 16 was operated over a range of discharges. Approximately 12 hours of 1 D velocity data were collected at low (12 kcfs), middle (16. 2 kcfs), and high (19. 2 kcfs) turbine discharges. The 1 D dataset indicates large differences in flow patterns and RMS velocity fluctuations among the various discharge levels. Results from this project show that it is technically feasible to measure 3 D water velocities directly downstream of an operating turbine unit using a narrow beam swath (i. e., 6 -degree) ADCP. Data products from these 3 D velocity data include a measurement of the draft tube barrel flow distribution (a. k. a., the flow split), directional changes and the general decay of velocity as flow exits the draft tube and enters the tailrace, and a relative measure of the homogeneity of the flow field...|$|E

A pier extension was installed adjacent to the Holyoke Dam bascule gate, the opening of an experimental weir inserted in the bascule gate was {{moved closer to the}} Hadley Falls Station intakes, and above-water lighting was added. An intake rack overlay was in place at both Hadley Falls Station units {{during the first half of}} this evaluation; the Unit 2 overlay was removed during the second half. Radiotagged, hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon smolts were released upstream of the Project and downstream passage routes were monitored. All releases were conducted after flashboards had been installed on the crest of the dam, closing that passage route. Overall, 63 % of the radiotagged smolts that approached Hadley Falls Station passed over the bascule gate weir and 37 % passed through the turbines. These results were comparable to results obtained in a 1992 evaluation, when a floating <b>guide</b> <b>wall</b> was present upstream of the intakes. Two-thirds of the radiotagged smolts that passed through the turbines at Hadley Falls Station did so through Unit 1. Removal of the Unit 2 intake rack overlay did not affect the proportion of radiotagged smolts passing through the turbines. Combining data from 1992 and 1995, a statistically significant but weak negative relationship between flow through the station and the proportion of radiotagged smolts passing over the bascule gate/weir was found. The louver/bypass system in the Holyoky Canal passed 91 % of the radiotagged smolts entering the canal back to the Hadley Falls Station tailrace. Above-water lighting installed upstream of the canal gatehouse appeared to have raised the proportion of radiotagged smolts entering the canal. When the results of passage through the bascule gate weir and the louver/bypass system were combined, 74 % of the radiotagged smolts passed through downstream passage facilities.

Wave Motion, 36 (1), pp. 67 - 85. The existence of trapped modes near obstacles in two-dimensional waveguides {{is well established}} when the centre-line of the guide is a line of symmetry for the geometry. In this paper we examine cases where no such line of symmetry exists. The boundary condition on the obstacle is of Neumann type and both Neumann and Dirichlet conditions on the <b>guide</b> <b>walls</b> are treated. A variety of techniques (variational methods, boundary integral equations, slender-body theory, modified residue calculus theory) are used to investigate trapped mode phenomena {{in a number of}} different frequency bands...|$|R

Homogeneous impedance (Robin) conditions are imposed along the <b>guide</b> <b>walls</b> {{and we find}} that in certain circumstances, negative curvature of the lowest (bending) mode can be achieved. This is unexpected, {{and has not been}} observed in a variety of physical situations examined by other authors. Further unexpected properties include the existence of the bending mode only on a subset of the Brillouin zone, as well as permitting otherwise unobtainable velocities of energy transmission. We conclude with a discussion of how such boundary conditions might be physically reproduced using effective conditions and homogenization theory, although the methodology to achieve these effective conditions is an open problem...|$|R
