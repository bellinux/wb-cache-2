[...] However, in 1969, Dylan confessed to Rolling Stones editor, Jann Wenner, [...] "I just sat down at a table and started writing... And I just got carried away with the whole thing... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> writing and I couldn't stop.

500|$|The band's lead singer/guitarist Patrick Stump {{stated that}} the band had not planned to cover the song. [...] "Basically, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> playing the riff in sound-check one day, and then we all started playing it, and then we started playing it live, and then we figured we'd record {{it and put it}} out with our live DVD." [...] Bassist Pete Wentz added that the band had not {{originally}} intended for the song to be released as a single either. [...] "'Beat It' seemed like a song that would be cool and that we could do our own take on", he said. Having spent time deciding on a guitarist for the song, Wentz eventually called John Mayer to add the guitar solo. [...] "We were trying to think about who is a contemporary guitar guy who's going to go down as a legend", Wentz later noted.|$|E

500|$|The {{joke about}} Mulder wanting Richard Gere {{to appear in}} the movie stemmed from the fact that Duchovny's acting was often {{compared}} to Gere's. Duchovny decided to turn the idea into a joke, saying, [...] "we used to always have the joke on set that when they do the movie it's going to be Richard Gere and Jodie Foster [...] So I originally wrote the teaser for Richard Gere and Jodie Foster and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> to think about it and you know, it's so much funnier with Garry and Téa." [...] The episode featured several uncredited celebrity cameos. During the premiere of the movie, Duchovny's Return to Me costars Minnie Driver and David Alan Grier appear as members of the audience. In addition, Chris Carter, the show's creator, made a cameo during the theater scene. The appearance was his second in the series.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, when Aronofsky turned 30 years old, {{his parents}} were {{diagnosed}} with cancer. He began reflecting on human mortality, [...] "That was a really heavy-duty emotional time. I know it's a very young age, but turning thirty marks when your twenties are over and you could start considering, 'Wow, {{one of these days}} I'm actually going to die.'" [...] While his parents overcame cancer, he began to focus on the concept of a young man saving a loved one from a life-threatening disease. He shared the concept with Handel, his undergraduate school roommate at Harvard University. Handel earned a Ph.D in neuroscience from New York University but was uncertain about a future in neuroscience. He recalled the discussion, [...] "Darren and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> talking about the story. We kept wanting to talk more about it as the story kept getting bigger. I decided to make some life choices to continue working with Darren, because it was so much fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Maia Ahmad, at {{the time}} wife of the {{musician}} Ahmad Dhani, had been a background singer for her husband's band Dewa 19 since 1993. She had been musically inclined since childhood and had formed a band while a teenager. She intended to be like her husband and enter the music industry as a headline performer. In a later interview, she explained her motivations: [...] "I wasn't following {{on the success of}} Krisdayanti dan Anang, a husband and wife who had made an album together. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> when I did. Dhani only gave me the time then, as our children were getting older and I could focus on my music." [...] With Dhani's guidance, in 1999 Maia decided to form a duo consisting of a singer and a musician, with the name Ratu. The concept was based on that of international bands like Roxette and Savage Garden. Maia set herself as a keyboardist, then began to look for a vocalist.|$|E

500|$|While both Duchovny and Carter {{had wanted}} to write an episode about {{baseball}} for several years, Duchovny first conceived the basic premise for [...] "The Unnatural" [...] during the home run race in 1998 between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa when he read a newspaper report about Joe Bauman. Bauman was a baseball player who, despite hitting 72 home runs during the 1954 season—at the time, a record for a professional player—never {{made it to the}} Major Leagues. Duchovny immediately connected the story of Bauman, who played for the Roswell Rockets, with the 1947 Roswell Incident, saying [...] "I just made the association...What if this guy was an alien? and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> working on that idea." [...] Duchovny later said that [...] "these happy chronological coincidences" [...] facilitated the development of the story. Duchovny worked on his idea alone, later admitting that he was satisfied that he did not receive any help.|$|E
500|$|Ten {{features}} a two-part track entitled [...] "Master/Slave" [...] that both opens {{and closes the}} album. The first part begins the album, before [...] "Once" [...] starts, {{and the second part}} closes the album, after [...] "Release". It begins about ten seconds after the album's closer [...] "Release" [...] as a hidden track, but both count as one track on the CD. The song is entirely instrumental (except for random unintelligible words Vedder utters throughout) with a dominant fretless bass line makes up the core of the song (which Ament referred to in a 1994 Bass Player magazine interview as [...] "my tribute to (fretless bass instrumentalist) Mick Karn"), along with some guitar and sounds that seem to come from the drums. Producer Rick Parashar stated in 2002, [...] "As I recall, I think Jeff had, like, a bass line...I heard the bass line and then we kind of were collaborating on that in the control room, and then <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> programming on the keyboard all this stuff; he was jamming with it and it just kind of came about like that." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Nostalgia, Ultra, other artists took {{interest}} in Ocean and contacted him about working together, leading to collaborations on Channel Orange. He previewed songs {{at different stages of}} completion to get feedback from guest artists, some of whom he cited as his [...] "creative heroes", including record producer Pharrell, who co-wrote and co-produced [...] "Sweet Life" [...] with Ocean. Ocean and Malay previewed songs to rock musician John Mayer, which inspired his guitar playing for both [...] "Pyramids" [...] and [...] "White". For the latter track, they used the instrumental of the song of the same name from Odd Future's 2012 album The OF Tape Vol. 2, recorded atmospheric instrumentation by Mayer and other musicians, and tracked it to the original instrumental. Ocean reached out to rappers André 3000 and Big Boi of hip hop duo Outkast to appear on [...] "Pink Matter". However, André 3000 did not want to reunite with Big Boi as a duo on another artist's album. The former ended up rapping alone and playing guitar on the song. Ocean told him to tell any kind of story with his verse for [...] "Pink Matter", of which André 3000 later said, [...] "when I got the track, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> writing to it and I was just, I'm just happy {{to be a part of}} that whole movement and his whole movement because he has become a whole 'nother kind of icon in today's age." ...|$|E

500|$|Tyler had her {{breakthrough}} {{role in the}} art house film Stealing Beauty (1996), {{in which}} she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews, but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by the critics. Variety wrote: [...] "Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue." [...] Empire noted, [...] "Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with {{a rare opportunity to}} enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure." [...] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said [...] "there was something missing in all of them". He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as [...] "a New York aura". During promotion of the film, Tyler said she wanted to separate herself from the character during production: [...] "I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> to cry and cry. I remembered when I found out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title track}} was said by band members {{to be the}} {{continuation}} of [...] "Final Six", which was an outtake from their previous album. [...] "Final Six" [...] origins deal with the apocalypse. [...] "Human Strain" [...] deals with apocalyptic origins as well. The track was explained by guitarist Jeff Hanneman to initially be about the human race dying off by a mutative disease. The title of [...] "Public Display of Dismemberment" [...] refers to the consequences that countries outside of the United States give to citizens for crimes. Tom Araya said that [...] "Unit 731" [...] is [...] "very similar to Josef Mengele {{in the sense that}} it was a medical unit in the military, which was a Japanese military unit, actually. They did kind of the same thing; they tested the limits of the human body and recorded it for scientific purposes." [...] "Playing With Dolls" [...] is about a child witnessing a serial killer. [...] "Beauty Through Order" [...] is about Elizabeth Báthory, the most prolific female serial killer. Jeff Hanneman explained: [...] "I've been meaning to write a song about that for a long time. I couldn't figure out the angle, I was thinking, 'How does a woman write? I can't write like a woman I'm a guy!' Then I just figured, 'Well, she's evil; she has lots of power and killed people.' So <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> writing and the lyrics and they came out." [...] Slayer revealed to Revolver that the track [...] "Snuff" [...] has no lyrical concept. [...] "Psychopathy Red" [...] was inspired by the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo.|$|E

Where was I? What made me excited? And I remembered art, that I loved going to museums and I loved looking at paintings, loved listening to music. Those things came from my mother, who took me to concerts and museums. I remembered Grandma and the blocks, and just on a hunch, I tried some architecture classes." [...] Gehry graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree from USC in 1954.|$|E

2500|$|After {{constantly}} explaining {{concepts and}} story outlines to interviewers and fans, Turner chose {{to keep the}} thematic basis of In the Absence of Truth quiet. [...] "Through explaining the last two albums time and time again, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> to become weary of the topic, and I started to feel like I was losing my connection to {{the music and the}} lyrics simply from having repeated it so many times [...] I feel there's a lot of emphasis these days placed on explaining everything in such a fashion that there's really nothing left for the listener or reader to explore themselves. It's all spelled out," [...] Turner continues. [...] "So it's interesting to leave some of that stuff open-ended so they have to {{do a little bit of}} legwork themselves." [...] He was similarly reticent about revealing much which went into Wavering Radiant, beyond noting that Carl Jung's theories, and dreams, served as inspiration.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson's {{idea for}} [...] "Black Cat" [...] {{was based on}} a warning to a rebel {{involved}} in substance abuse, in addition to the consequences of drug addiction. Its composition compares the theme to the folklore superstitions of cats having nine lives and black cats foreshadowing a negative omen or misfortune. She also related its title to the bold nature of a panther, saying [...] "I have always felt some kind of connection between myself and a panther. They're not afraid of anything, they're willing to take on anything–that's the way I feel about my work." [...] Regarding its development, she said, [...] "I was getting dressed and ready to go to the studio. The television was on - some commercials and other stuff. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> humming a melody. I don't know why and it kept sticking in my head. So I put it down on tape."

Drake described the studio session with Keys as [...] "one of the best studio experiences of my life". He explained that [...] "I came in there and instead of being like, 'Here's the beat, get to work,' she was just like, 'Play me your favorite songs and lets battle'...

I'm just taught to fight pressure with pressure, so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> fighting back and knocked him into Sanchez and {{it created a}} fumble." [...] In NBC's television broadcast, immediately following the play, color commentator Cris Collinsworth said that [...] "Vince Wilfork just threw Brandon Moore into Mark Sanchez," [...] a view simultaneously echoed on the Patriots radio call by color analyst Scott Zolak. Moore disagreed with Collinsworth: [...] "when somebody slides {{into the back of}} you, you're going to fall. That happens a lot in general. You don't know what's going on (behind you)." [...] Responding to Moore, Collinsworth qualified his description in a phone interview with ESPN, saying that Wilfork could see the play develop, so [...] "instead of trying to go around Moore, he pushed him back into the play and made the whole thing happen." [...] A New York Daily News columnist sided with Moore, stating that [...] "A second look at the play shows Moore holding his own against Wilfork and moving, if anything, mostly forward." ...|$|E
