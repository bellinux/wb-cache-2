40|$|The minimum {{information}} necessary to specify motion requires {{a change in}} position across time. Previous {{studies have shown that}} human motion measurements improve with more than two frames of motion. This study clarifies how motion information is integrated to produce the best speed and direction discrimination. Using random-dot kinematograms, fine-direction discrimination thresholds and speed discrimination thresholds are assessed as a function of dot lifetime. Specifically, we ask if performance on both tasks depends on dot lifetime in the same manner. If both speed and direction discrimination performance improve the same way with increasing dot lifetime, this would indicate that both tasks have the same <b>integration</b> <b>limit</b> and both tasks may depend on the same underlying mechanisms. Experiment 1 shows that for both tasks a four-frame dot lifetime is necessary for observers to reach asymptotic threshold levels. The absolute level of performance improves with increasing stimulus duration or signal-to-noise ratio, but the <b>integration</b> <b>limit</b> itself does not vary. Experiment 2 examines whether this <b>integration</b> <b>limit</b> is constrained by the number of frames or by the temporal duration of the dot lifetime. The data in Experiment 2 suggest that both a minimum number of samples and a minimal temporal integration period determine the <b>integration</b> <b>limit</b> for recruitment mechanisms. The results suggest that speed and fine-direction discrimination depend upon the same underlying motion mechanisms. These results are discussed in relation to possible underlying physiological substrates and computational models of motion measurement...|$|E
30|$|One {{possible}} {{reason for the}} systematic underestimation of TOCs higher than 60 DU lies {{in the choice of}} 200 hPa as a static upper <b>integration</b> <b>limit</b> for the retrieved ozone column. In fact, if this TOC definition is used, extreme TOC values can be expected when the actual tropopause pressure exceeds 200 hPa (i.e., when the actual tropopause height is lower than the upper <b>integration</b> <b>limit</b> used in the OMI-TOC NN), because a large portion of stratospheric air—which is very rich in ozone—is included in the column over which the ozone profile is integrated in order to derive TOC. As a result, including the tropopause pressure in the input vector can help the NN discriminate such cases of enhanced TOC, and hence improve the overall retrieval accuracy.|$|E

Even the shortest of the interocular delays resulted in larger grip apertures than those in the continuous monocular and binocular viewing conditions. The short temporal integration interval of stereovision obtained in this study cannot be accounted for by diVerential visual feedback in the binocular and interocular delay conditions, nor is it likely to be a consequence of visual disruption due to the interocular delays.

40|$|International audienceThe {{relevance}} of finescale parameterizations of dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy is addressed using finescale and microstructure measurements {{collected in the}} Lucky Strike segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). There, high amplitude internal tides and a strongly sheared mean flow sustain {{a high level of}} dissipation rate and turbulent mixing. Two sets of parameterizations are considered: the first ones (Gregg, 1989; Kunze et al, 2006) were derived to estimate dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy induced by internal wave breaking, while the second one aimed to estimate dissipation induced by shear instability of a strongly sheared mean flow and {{is a function of the}} Richardson number (Kunze et al, 1990; Polzin 1996). The latter parameterization has low skill in reproducing the observed dissi-pation rate when shear unstable events are resolved presumably because there is no scale separation between the duration of unstable events and the inverse growth rate of unstable billows. Instead GM based parameterizations were found to be relevant although slight biases were observed. Part of these biases result from the small value of the upper vertical wavenumber <b>integration</b> <b>limit</b> in the computation of shear variance in Kunze et al (2006) parameterization that does not take into account internal wave signal of high vertical wavenumbers.
