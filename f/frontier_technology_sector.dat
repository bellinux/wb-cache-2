40|$|Abstract: Individual country {{industrial}} sector productivity growth {{must be understood}} {{in the context of}} the world <b>technology</b> <b>frontier.</b> Industrial <b>sector</b> productivities are to a large extent driven by the international development of similar sectors. This is investigated in this analysis of productivity growth in South African manufacturing sectors and represents an alternative to conventional analysis of domestic determinants of productivity. Productivities in U. S. manufacturing sectors serve as the world <b>technology</b> <b>frontier</b> and allow identification of causal effects of South African productivities. The results show the importance of the world <b>technology</b> <b>frontier</b> and we argue that existing studies overlooking the world frontier may have serious omitted variable bias...|$|R

A piecewise linear <b>frontier</b> <b>technology,</b> reflecting observed best practice, accommodating the multi-output nature of distribution utilities is specified. A Malmquist index and its components, shift in <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> and change in efficiency, have been calculated for the period 1983 to 1989. The main results are a positive productivity growth averaging nearly 2 % per year, {{and that this is}} mainly due to <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> shift.

40|$|Industrial <b>sector</b> <b>technology</b> growth must be {{understood}} {{in the context of}} the international technology development. We study South African manufacturing industries and let the US represent the world <b>technology</b> <b>frontier.</b> The industrial <b>sector</b> linkages between domestic and <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> shocks are estimated using panel-data for the period 1970 – 1995. The results show that industrial performance in South Africa is related to the world <b>technology</b> <b>frontier</b> and consequently existing studies of technology overlooking the international context have omitted variable bias. We find that South Africa industries respond to the technology gap to the US, but that the industries are lagging behind. The analysis explains prolonged stagnation in this middle income country and rejects catching up to the frontier. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an alternative environmentally sensitive productivity growth index to incorporate group heterogeneities into a conventional Malmquist-Luenberger productivity growth index. The proposed approach allows {{the calculation of}} both efficiency and technical changes, for economic agents operating under different technologies. Moreover, it also enables the computation {{of changes in the}} technological gap between regional and global <b>frontier</b> <b>technologies.</b> The proposed index is employed in measuring productivity growth and its decomposed components in 46 countries between 1993 and 2003. The main finding is that Europe has taken the lead in the world <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> and that Asia has attempted to move towards the <b>frontier</b> <b>technology.</b> Subsequent policy implications are provided based on some empirical studies.

30|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, China has {{experienced}} an industrial productivity revolution mainly driven by the FTP. The FTP promoted the fast growth of industrial productivity on one hand and broadened the TE gap on the other hand, which means that the sustainable development of the economy and the industrial productivity revolution can be driven by both making industrial <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> progress and increasing industrial average efficiency. From the policy aspect, China’s industrial development must place emphasis on enforcing competition, narrowing the efficiency gap between enterprises and keeping the <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> progressing by emulating, learning from, catching up with, helping each other, {{and at the same time}} absorbing advanced technology, and keeping the <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> progressing. In addition, it is necessary to further the market-orient economy reform, keeping the factor of labor and capital adjustable and increase the AE and SE of industrial economy on the micro level.|$|R
30|$|The {{stochastic}} frontier {{production model}} was originally developed by [1, 11], and soon became popular in econometrics. In this model, {{we assume that}} some non-price factors such as organizing, management or institutional factors {{could lead to the}} loss of efficiency during the production process, and thus cannot reach the optimal <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> level. Nishimizu and Page [12] suggested decomposing TFP into the change of <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> and the change of relative <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> efficiency. Later on, lots of research has been done using this method to analyze the improvement in TFP. Bauer [2] used the data on the U.S. airline industry to decompose the TFP growth into the change in <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> progress, the change in technology efficiency relative to the frontier, and the improvement in scale economy. This approach was also applied to analysis on the TFP and <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> progress in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) manufacturing industry [3]. Additionally, with the above model, decomposition of TFP of the Korean manufacturing industries and agriculture in all the provinces in China were studied [6 – 8], and the technical efficiency (TE) of the industrial sector of China were inspect [15, 16]. Furtherly, the constant-scale-return non-parameter model was introduced in decomposing TFP growth rate by the DEA-Malmquist index method, using province data of China [4], and the effects of ownership on the productivity of China’s manufacturing sector were interpreted based on the data of 1, 036 super-sized industrial enterprises in 1993 [13]. Besides, Wu [14] employed the panel data of 27 provinces during 1981 – 1995, and studied the sustainable development problem of China through the decomposition of productivity.|$|R

The general and specific trends {{of the creation of}} high <b>technologies</b> <b>sector</b> in the context of enlargement of the European Union are described and analyzed. The needs and priorities of the creation and further development of high <b>technologies</b> <b>sector</b> in the European Union, as well as the main challenges for the creation, development and further modernization of high <b>technologies</b> <b>sector</b> in the context of globalization, European integration and creation of the knowledge based society and knowledge economy, are discussed. The structure and the main spheres and parts of the contemporary high <b>technologies</b> <b>sector</b> in the European Union are characterized. New theoretical concept oriented to the creation, development and further modernization of high <b>technologies</b> <b>sector,</b> and based on the priorities of initiation of the synergy effects, is described. The essence of this theoretical concept – orientation to the multifaced interaction between different institutions and organizations representing different activities, functions, systems and interests, and different industries, different spheres of production, manufacturing and services, as well as different sectors of economy and social life in general. The role of the processes of internationalization and their impact on the development of high <b>technologies</b> <b>sector</b> are analyzed. There are many possibilities to implement new the non–traditional ideas of intensive technological development, which could be very successful in the context of contemporary challenges of high <b>technologies</b> <b>sector's</b> development and modernization. The following ideas are emphasized: (1) the idea of rational specialization of every high <b>technologies</b> <b>sector</b> in every national or regional economic system; (2) the idea of “oases” and of complex clusterization...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCan {{a country}} grow faster by saving more? The paper {{addresses}} this question both theoretically and empirically. In the theoretical model, growth results from innovations that allow local sectors {{to catch up}} with <b>frontier</b> <b>technology.</b> In poor countries, catching up requires the cooperation of a foreign investor who is familiar with the <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> and a domestic entrepreneur who is familiar with local conditions. In such a country, domestic savings matters for innovation, and therefore growth, because it enables the local entrepreneur to put equity into this cooperative venture, which mitigates an agency problem that would otherwise deter the foreign investor from participating. In rich countries, domestic entrepreneurs are already familiar with <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> and therefore do not need to attract foreign investment to innovate, so domestic savings does not matter for growth.

30|$|The {{literature}} that uses macro data in TFP study of Chinese economy is numerous. But {{in the field}} of Chinese productivity growth research, no literature using panel data at the firm level to estimate and decompose the TFP in Chinese industries is available. By using unbalanced panel data and stochastic frontier model, this paper studies the change in TFP of the LMIE in different industry sectors during 1995 – 2002. By following the analyzing method brought forward by Kumbhakar and Lovell [10], the increase in TFP is decomposed into four parts in the present work,: including <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> progress, change in relative <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> efficiency, elevation on resources allocation efficiency and improvement on scale efficiency.|$|R

The measure of how much one country gets closer to or further away from world <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> is commonly known as the TGC score.

This signifies that Asian countries lead world <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> and most African countries do not.

40|$|The report finds clear {{evidence}} of the potential of <b>frontier</b> <b>technologies</b> to contribute to social, economic and political development gains {{in a number of}} ways, by: • Driving innovations in business models, products and processes that provide new goods and services to ‘bottom of the pyramid’ consumers; • Providing the means by which to make better use of existing underutilised household and productive assets; • Catalysing increases in demand, nationally and internationally, which create new industries and markets, leading to macro- and microeconomic growth; and • Changing demand for labour and capital, leading to direct job creation and transformation of the workforce. For all of the potential upsides, potential downsides must also be considered. While it will largely be the private sector that will drive deployment of these <b>technologies,</b> the public <b>sector</b> through national regulation, as well as development financing, will have a major role in mediating the pace and direction of technological change, both to achieve development objectives, and to protect potential losers. As new technologies and digital business models reshape economies and disrupt incumbencies, interest has surged in the potential of novel <b>frontier</b> <b>technologies</b> to also contribute to positive changes in international development and humanitarian contexts. Widespread adoption of new technologies is acknowledged as centrally important to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. But while <b>frontier</b> <b>technologies</b> can rapidly address large-scale economic, social or political challenges, they can also involve the displacement of existing technologies and carry considerable uncertainty and risk.

40|$|Can {{a country}} grow faster by saving more? We address this {{question}} both theoretically and empirically. In our model, growth results from innovations that allow local sectors {{to catch up}} with the <b>frontier</b> <b>technology.</b> In relatively poor countries, catching up with the frontier requires the involvement of a foreign investor, who is familiar with the <b>frontier</b> <b>technology,</b> together with effort on the part of a local bank, who can directly monitor local projects to which the technology must be adapted. In such a country, local saving matters for innovation, and therefore growth, because it allows the domestic bank to cofinance projects and thus to attract foreign investment. But in countries close to the frontier, local firms are familiar with the <b>frontier</b> <b>technology,</b> and therefore do not need to attract foreign investment to undertake an innovation project, so local saving does not matter for growth. In our empirical exploration we show that lagged savings is significantly associated with productivity growth for poor but not for rich countries. This effect operates entirely through TFP rather than through capital accumulation. Further, we show that savings is significantly associated with higher levels of FDI inflows and equipment imports and that the effect that these have on growth is significantly larger for poor countries than rich. ...|$|R
