5000|$|In another {{classic case}} of {{multiple}} discovery, the two discoverers showed more civility. By June 1858 Charles Darwin had completed over two-thirds of his On the Origin of Species when he received a startling letter from a naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, 13 years his junior, {{with whom he had}} corresponded. The letter summarized Wallace's theory of natural selection, with conclusions identical to Darwin's own. Darwin turned for advice to his friend Charles Lyell, the foremost geologist of the day. Lyell proposed that Darwin and Wallace prepare a <b>joint</b> <b>communication</b> to the scientific community. Darwin being preoccupied with his mortally ill youngest son, Lyell enlisted Darwin's closest friend, Joseph Hooker, director of Kew Gardens, and together on 1 July 1858 they presented to the Linnean Society a joint paper that brought together Wallace's abstract with extracts from Darwin's earlier, 1844 essay on the subject. The paper was also published that year in the Society's journal. Neither the public reading of the joint paper nor its publication attracted the least interest; but Wallace, [...] "admirably free from envy or jealousy," [...] had been content to remain in Darwin's shadow.|$|E

After President Dwight D.

40|$|A {{formulation}} for a <b>joint</b> <b>communication</b> and estimation {{problem is}} proposed: simultaneous communication over a noisy channel and estimation of certain channel parameters are desired. We {{are interested in}} quantifying the tradeoff between the achievable rate and distortion in estimating the channel parameters. Two particular sample channels are considered and achievable rates for these channels are determined. First, the binary symmetric channel is examined; an achievable capacity-distortion tradeoff is derived for both joint and time-orthogonal protocols. For the flat fading, additive, white, Gaussian noise channel, a novel <b>joint</b> <b>communication</b> and estimation scheme using low correlation sequences is presented. It is observed that in most situations, <b>joint</b> <b>communication</b> and estimation performs better than a scheme where communication and estimation are performed individually, furthermore, the gains of <b>joint</b> <b>communication</b> and estimation over individual communication and estimation can be significant as the distortion tolerance increases.

Synergetic effects like improved resource allocation and new applications like location-based services or a precise location determination of emergency calls are attractive features of <b>joint</b> <b>communication</b> and positioning. Since the system requirements {{of communication and}} positioning are quite different, it is a challenging task to combine them: Communication aims at high data rates with little training overhead. Only the channel coefficients of the equivalent discrete-time channel model, which includes pulse shaping and receive filtering {{in addition to the}} physical channel, need to be estimated for data detection. In contrast, positioning aims at precise position estimates. Therefore, parameters of the physical channel like the time of arrival (TOA) or the angle of arrival (AOA) need to be estimated as accurately as possible [2, 3]. Significant training is typically spent for this purpose.|$|E
