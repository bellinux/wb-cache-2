5|$|Her third husband, Asa Gilbert Eddy, died {{five years}} after they married; she {{believed}} he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> malicious animal magnetism. Six years later, when she was 67 and apparently in need of loyalty and affection, she legally adopted a 41-year-old homeopath as her second son.|$|E
5|$|By June 1992, {{approximately}} 800 people <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> the bombardment. By {{the end of}} the Croatian War of Independence in 1995, a {{total of}} 1,724 people from Osijek had been killed, including 1,327 soldiers and 397 civilians. The city itself suffered great damage during the war, with the bulk of direct damage occurring {{as a consequence of the}} 1991–92 bombardment. Direct war damage sustained by the city was estimated at a total of US$1.3billion. The damage was regularly recorded by 400 volunteers during the bombardment.|$|E

5|$|De León later rescued L'Archeveque and his {{companion}} Jacques Grollet. On interrogation, the men maintained that over 100 of the French settlers {{had died of}} smallpox, and the others <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> Native Americans. The only people known to have survived the final attack were the Talon children, who had been adopted by the Karankawa. According to the children, the settlement had been attacked around Christmas of 1688, and all the remaining settlers had been killed.|$|E
5|$|Dodge {{noted the}} number of Sauk dead at 40, {{possibly}} more; he reported that Ho-Chunk scouts and militia men took at least that number of scalps after the battle. U.S. allied Ho-Chunk, during the night following the battle, scalped another 11 Sauk who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> the militia, and Dodge had seen Sauk wounded being carried from the battlefield during the fighting. Dodge's forces suffered one dead and 8 wounded, of whom one was injured during the march to Wisconsin Heights, before the battle.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels' efforts {{had little}} impact {{for the time}} being, as while Hitler was in {{principle}} in favour of total war, he {{was not prepared to}} implement changes over the objections of his ministers. The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the action, Rotheram left Royal Sovereign to take command of HMS Bellerophon, whose captain, John Cooke <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> a French sniper. Cooke had been targeted due to the dress uniform he had worn during the battle. Bellerophon escorted Victory carrying Nelson's body back to Britain, and Rotheram carried the guidon behind the coffin at Nelson's funeral in London. Rotheram was presented with a gold medal and sword of honour in recognition of his services in the action, and continued in command of Bellerophon.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reports said}} that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> an {{explosion}} set off by one of her captors. A joint official investigation by the United Kingdom and the United States later concluded that her fatal injuries were inflicted by a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers. A February 2011 coroner's narrative verdict reported that Norgrove died during the failed rescue attempt. In October 2012, one of her colleagues {{said in an interview}} that the captors had told Norgrove that they had no intention of killing her.|$|E
5|$|It {{has often}} been claimed that ceratopsian dinosaurs were herding animals, due to {{the large number of}} known bone beds {{containing}} multiple members of the same ceratopsian species. In 2010, Hunt and Farke pointed out that this was mainly true for centrosaurine ceratopsians. Horner assumed that the horned dinosaurs at Landslide Butte lived in herds that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> drought or disease. Dodson concluded that the fact that the Achelousaurus bone beds were monospecific (containing only one species) confirmed the existence of herds.|$|E

5|$|Kogălniceanu's nephew, Grigore, {{himself a}} local {{leader of the}} Conservative Party and a major landowner, married to Adela Cantacuzino-Pașcanu, {{a member of the}} Cantacuzino family. He died in 1904, leaving his wife a large fortune, which she spent on a large {{collection}} of jewels and fortune-telling séances. Adela Kogălniceanu was robbed and murdered in October 1920; rumor had it that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> her own son, but this path was never pursued by authorities, who were quick to cancel the investigation (at the time, they were faced with the major strikes of 1920).|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{bitterness}} of the campaign and {{the timing of the}} murder, speculation mounted that Sharp <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> an Anti-Relief partisan. For some time, rumors traveled that Darby was implicated in his death. Sharp's political rival, John J. Crittenden, tried to blunt such accusations by personally introducing a resolution condemning the murder and offering a $3000 reward for the capture of the assassin. The trustees of the city of Frankfort added a reward of $1000, and an additional $2000 reward was raised from private sources. In the 1825 session of the General Assembly, a measure to form Sharp County from Muhlenberg County died on the floor due to the tumultuous politics of the session.|$|E
5|$|Controversy rapidly {{surrounded}} Edward's death. With Mortimer's {{execution in}} 1330, rumours began to circulate that Edward {{had been murdered}} at Berkeley Castle. Accounts that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> the insertion of a red-hot iron or poker into his anus slowly began to circulate, possibly {{as a result of}} deliberate propaganda; chroniclers in the mid-1330s and 1340s spread this account further, supported in later years by Geoffrey le Baker's colourful account of the killing. It became incorporated into most later histories of Edward, typically being linked to his possible homosexuality. Most historians now dismiss this account of Edward's death, querying the logic in Edward's captors murdering him in such an easily detectable fashion.|$|E

5|$|Faramir first {{encountered}} the hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in Ithilien and recognized {{them to be}} the Halflings mentioned in his dreams. Faramir questioned Frodo of his quest, and Frodo revealed that he, along with eight other companions including Boromir, had set out from Rivendell. During the interrogation, Faramir asked often about Boromir, since he knew, although Frodo at that point did not, that Boromir was already dead. One night, while on guard, Faramir waded down to the Anduin river after seeing a boat there. It contained the dead body of his brother, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> Orcs after Frodo left the group.|$|E
5|$|Following these events, Macrinus {{traveled}} to Apamea {{to ensure the}} loyalty of Legio II Parthica before setting off to march against Emesa. According to Dio, Macrinus appointed his son Diadumenian {{to the position of}} Imperator, and promised the soldiers 20,000 Sesterces each, with 4,000 of these to be paid on the spot. Dio further comments that Macrinus hosted a dinner for the residents of Apamea in honour of Diadumenian. At the dinner, Macrinus was supposedly presented with the head of Ulpius Julianus who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> his soldiers. In response, Macrinus left Apamea headed south.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Kinkaid became Assistant Chief of Staff to the Commander U.S. Naval Detachment in Turkish Waters, Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol. This tour saw {{the end of}} the Greek {{occupation}} of Smyrna. The ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne by Turkey resulted in a draw-down of U.S. naval forces in the region, reducing Bristol's post to a primarily diplomatic one. In 1924, Kinkaid, whose father had died in August 1920, requested a posting back to the United States owing to his mother's ill-health. The ship taking him back, the light cruiser , had to sail by way of Iran in order to collect the body of Vice Consul Robert Imbrie, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> an angry mob in Tehran.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, the PTC {{launched}} a campaign against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), complaining that their SmackDown! program contained levels of sexuality and violence unbecoming prime time programming. In the campaign, Bozell said that four children <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> peers emulating professional wrestling moves learned from the program. With these allegations, Bozell and various PTC members began meeting {{with representatives of the}} advertising departments of various companies that advertised on SmackDown! to persuade them to withdraw sponsorship. The PTC also suggested that between 30 and 40 advertisers had pulled their commercials from WWF programming, an assertion that was not true.|$|E

He then reunites with a {{restored}} Alisa and Lee, but the three are attacked by the Tekken Forces, who in turn are attacked by Lars' forces {{in an attempt to}} stop them from targeting Jin. He saves Jin's life again, this time from a journalist who intended to avenge his family, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> Jin. After seeing his half-brother, Kazuya Mishima, killing Heihachi, Lars reveals that the reason for him saving Jin was that he wants him to kill Kazuya and restore world peace, to which Jin agrees.|$|E
5|$|Norgrove {{was removed}} from the scene via {{helicopter}} and received medical care, but she died. It was reported initially that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> one of her captors setting off a suicide vest. According to The Guardian, insurgents often put on suicide vests if they think they are in danger of being attacked. Taliban commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan (who were holding Norgrove) were among those killed in the raid, according to an Afghan intelligence official. Other women and children in the compound were uninjured, and no members of the rescue team were wounded.|$|E
