5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

Other clubs created traveling art collections and art libraries for communities. Clubs also hosted arts exhibits.

500|$|All Tom shows {{appear to}} have {{incorporated}} elements of melodrama and blackface minstrelsy. These plays varied tremendously in their politics—some faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery. Many of the productions featured demeaning racial caricatures of Black people, while a number of productions also featured songs by Stephen Foster (including [...] "My Old Kentucky Home", [...] "Old <b>Folks</b> <b>at</b> Home", and [...] "Massa's in the Cold Ground"). The best-known Tom Shows were those of George Aiken and H.J. Conway.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Tubman {{also worked}} {{at the home of}} a planter named James Cook. She had to check the muskrat traps in nearby marshes, even after {{contracting}} measles. She became so ill that Cook sent her back to Brodess, where her mother nursed her back to health. Brodess then hired her out again. She spoke later of her acute childhood homesickness, comparing herself to [...] "the boy on the Swanee River", an allusion to Stephen Foster's song [...] "Old <b>Folks</b> <b>at</b> Home." [...] As she grew older and stronger, she was assigned to field and forest work, driving oxen, plowing, and hauling logs.|$|E

Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back {{a large portion of}} the U.S. mortgage market. Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said [...] "it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped [...] "for Congress to have held hearings".|$|E
500|$|Other critics, such as GameZone's Michael Lafferty, {{were less}} {{reserved}} in their {{praise of the}} narrative—The Electric Playground {{referred to it as}} [...] "a textbook example to other console developers on how to write videogame prose"—but agreed that its complex and involved backstory could alienate some players. The Adrenaline Vault's Mike Laidlaw stated that [...] "the <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> Crystal Dynamics obviously have no kindness in their heart for game reviewers trying desperately to describe the plot". Journalists also commonly cited Soul Reaver 2s poor lifespan and replayability as an issue; the reviewer for Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine opined that [...] "the problem is that there just isn't much gameplay there" [...] and Fielder warned that play [...] "burns bright, but not as long as you'd like".|$|E
500|$|... "Whale Whores" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews.

Brian Jacks of MTV complimented the show's focus on whale conservation, writing, [...] "Leave it to the hard-hitting <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> South Park to do more for conservationism than fifteen cable reality shows put together." [...] Josh Modell of The A.V. Club said the episode was unfunny and mocked a television series that was [...] "culturally insignificant" [...] and not particularly well-known. Modell wrote, [...] "The show's star, Paul Watson, seems to have really pissed off South Park's creators Parker and Stone [...] Fine, but could you make me laugh a few times while you beat me {{over the head with}} information about a guy that I couldn't care less about?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "A Single Blade of Grass" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a A−, calling it [...] "yet another adventure in weird, Native American mysticism from the <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> 1013 Productions". VanDerWerff felt {{that although the}} episode contained several plot holes, it worked with [...] "a kind of dream sense, following its own weird, nightmare logic". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5. Gibron found that the episode contained several overly-unbelievable moments but was overall [...] "another great episode, even with some rather minor flaws". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "A Single Blade of Grass" [...] one star out of five. Shearman felt that the episode was [...] "tedious", citing a lack of any real action and a [...] "banal" [...] ending which he described as having been poorly foreshadowed. However, Shearman felt positively about the episode's attempt to {{stand on its own}} rather than imitating sister show The X-Files, which he saw several prior episodes as having done.|$|E
500|$|Chris Morran of Consumerist said Philip Morris did a [...] "really {{poor job}} of trying to defend its actions". He wrote, [...] "... this should be where the very serious <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> Philip Morris go point by point and explain where Oliver exaggerated and embellished, but they don't. It's a classic {{non-response}} in which the accused tried to undercut the accuser's argument by claiming he can't possibly be providing the truth." [...] He noted that Philip Morris does not deny making legal threats to suppress regulations on cigarette packaging and questions how the company: [...] " [...] {{to be taken seriously}} when it readily admits that the products it sells are 'harmful to health'". Furthermore, Morran takes aim at the company's claim that it [...] " [...] and [...] with thousands of regulations worldwide", writing: ... the tobacco industry doesn't support these regulations. It only supports the ones it can't fight in a courtroom. Once it loses a battle — or realizes a battle can't be won — then suddenly Big Tobacco, just like every other heavily regulated industry, claims to support and abide by the rules.|$|E
500|$|The {{real-time}} {{episode was}} broadcast on 22 June 2011 in Australia and on 20 July in the UK. It was watched by 408,000 Australian viewers upon its first airing, making Neighbours the highest rated show on digital multi-channels that night. In the UK, {{an audience of}} 1.30 million watched the episode. For his work on [...] "Episode 6188", Dutton earned a nomination for Best Direction in a TV Drama at the 2012 Australian Directors' Guild Awards. A TV Week website writer called the episode [...] "an edge-of-your-seat special", which was [...] "unmissable". The Sydney Morning Herald's readers gave the episode three out of five stars, while the paper's television critic, Andrew Murfett, commented [...] "The clock is omnipresent in tonight's 'real-time' Neighbours episode. The gimmick of the formatting – the episode unfolds in real time over an action-packed 30 minutes on Ramsay Street – means the clock appears almost every minute {{to remind us of}} what is a pressing deadline. It's a clever device for fans who have perhaps fallen {{out of touch with the}} <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> Erinsborough. In fact it's almost impossible not be at least mildly interested about the future prospects of Scott McGregor and Ashleigh Brewer in the aftermath of this 24-style ep." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} the video was [...] "a luxe-looking, moodily lit affair that finds the season 8 champ clad in a physique-appropriate black henley and {{stalking}} his way through an abandoned construction site featuring a giant countdown clock, a dramatic sunrise, and copious amounts of recycled plastic sheeting." [...] Slezak also said that, [...] "the <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> 19 gave Kris the proper budget to kick off his video career – at least we finally know what the company did with the savings gleaned from hiring student filmmakers to helm Blake Lewis and Diana DeGarmo’s tragic first clips". James Montgomery of MTV News noted that the video looked better and more expensive that past-first videos by American Idol alumni under 19. Montgomery also compared the video's [...] "artfully color-saturated frames and great expanses" [...] to Snow Patrol's [...] "Run" [...] clip and the Madonna, Justin Timberlake, and Timbaland's [...] "4 Minutes", doing away with the [...] "narrative crutch most Idol champs' debuts lean on (see, for example, David Cook's 'Light On'), putting the focus squarely on Allen himself." [...] He also said that, [...] "while Allen's debut video isn't as flashy-dashy as Idol compatriot Adam Lambert's 'Time for Miracles,' it's just as good – mostly because, rather than rely on fiery explosions, 'Dying' plays it straight, showcasing Allen and his talents", and called it [...] "bold" [...] as Allen was never shown as the [...] "flashy type".|$|E
500|$|To {{compose the}} score, Selznick chose Max Steiner, {{with whom he}} had worked at RKO Pictures in the early 1930s. Warner Bros.—who had {{contracted}} Steiner in 1936—agreed to lend him to Selznick. Steiner spent twelve weeks working on the score, the longest period that he had ever spent writing one, and at two hours and thirty-six minutes long it was also the longest that he had ever written. Five orchestrators were hired, including Hugo Friedhofer, Maurice de Packh, Bernard Kaun, Adolph Deutsch and Reginald Bassett. The score is characterized by two love themes, one for Ashley's and Melanie's sweet love and another that evokes Scarlett's passion for Ashley, though notably there is no Scarlett and Rhett love theme. Steiner drew considerably on folk and patriotic music, which included Stephen Foster tunes such as [...] "Louisiana Belle," [...] "Dolly Day," [...] "Ringo De Banjo," [...] "Beautiful Dreamer," [...] "Old <b>Folks</b> <b>at</b> Home," [...] and [...] "Katie Belle," [...] which formed the basis of Scarlett's theme; other tunes that feature prominently are: [...] "Marching through Georgia" [...] by Henry Clay Work, [...] "Dixie," [...] "Garryowen" [...] and [...] "The Bonnie Blue Flag." [...] The theme that is most associated with the film today is the melody that accompanies Tara, the O'Hara plantation; in the early 1940s, [...] "Tara's Theme" [...] formed the musical basis of the song [...] "My Own True Love" [...] by Mack David. In all, there are ninety-nine separate pieces of music featured in the score. Due to the pressure of completing on time, Steiner received some assistance in composing from Friedhofer, Deutsch and Heinz Roemheld, and in addition, two short cues—by Franz Waxman and William Axt—were taken from scores in the MGM library.|$|E
500|$|In January 1944 Formby {{described}} his experiences touring for ENSA in Europe and the Middle East in a BBC radio broadcast. He {{said that the}} troops [...] "were worrying quite {{a lot about you}} <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> home, but we soon put them right about that. We told them that after four and a half years, Britain was still the best country to live in". Shortly after he began filming He Snoops to Conquer—his fifth picture for Columbia—he was visited on set by the Dance Music Policy Committee (DMPC), an organisation responsible for vetting music for broadcast, which had also been given responsibility for checking if music was sympathetic towards the enemy during the war. The DMPC interviewed Formby about three songs that had been included in Bell-Bottom George: [...] "Swim Little Fish", [...] "If I Had a Girl Like You" [...] and [...] "Bell-Bottom George". Formby was summoned to the BBC's offices to perform his three songs in front of the committee, with his song checked against the available sheet music. A week later, on 1 February, the committee met and decided the songs were innocuous, although Formby was told {{that he would have to}} get further clearance if the lyrics were changed. Bret opines that he had been the victim of a plot by a member of the Variety Artists' Federation, following Formby's scathing comments on entertainers who were too scared to leave London to entertain the troops. The comments, which appeared in the forces magazine Union Jack, were then widely reported in the press in Britain. The Variety Artists' Federation demanded that Formby release names, and threatened him with action if he did not do so, but he refused to give in to their pressure.|$|E

The [...] "Thieves' Den", a 2.27MB download offering {{the chance to}} [...] "Uncover a famous pirate's lost ship and claim it for your own", was released on May 22 for the Xbox 360, priced at 150 Marketplace points, [...] "roughly" [...] equivalent to US$1.89. Explaining the add-on, Ashley Cheng stated [...] "Basically, it's Goonies." [...] "Mehrunes' Razor", a quest revolving around a mage {{in search of the}} deadly Daedric artifact known as Mehrunes' Razor, was released on June 14. It became the most expensive download yet, at US$2.99 for PC users and 250 Marketplace points, equivalent to US$3.13, for Xbox 360 owners. One 1UP.com reporter took the occasion to reflect on the increasing price of owning the [...] "complete" [...] Oblivion. With all the add-ons included, he calculated, [...] "That's over $80 in game for the complete version of Oblivion, thus far." [...] Foreseeing eventual problems with the upcoming PS3 release, and a potential bundling of all the software for a cheaper price, he wondered: [...] "will Xbox 360 and PC users feel slighted?...Microtransactions are sticky business." [...] Joystiq continued to comment on the [...] "Horse Armor" [...] add-on in their notice of the quest's release. [...] "With a weapon like that, who needs horse armor?" [...] On July 13, [...] "The Vile Lair", sporting a hidden crypt called [...] "Deepscorn Hollow" [...] for players bitten with Oblivions vampirism bug, was released. Like the [...] "Orrery" [...] and the [...] "Wizard's Tower", Bethesda set [...] "The Vile Lair"'s PC release price at US$1.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to US$1.88. Joystiq responded positively to the new price point. [...] "What a bargain!...It's good to see the <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> Oblivion have learned their lesson and aren't offering relatively super expensive content not fit to see the light of day." ...|$|E
