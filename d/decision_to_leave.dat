40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to examine}} factors that impact teacher retention in public schools in the southeast region of North Carolina. Additionally, the purpose was to identify variables that influence beginning teachers’ <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and veteran teachers’ <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> stay in the teaching profession. The 10 participants were former and current teachers employed in the State of North Carolina between 2008 and 2011. The research revealed that teacher support, working conditions, and student behavior were among the leading factors impacting beginning teachers’ <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the profession prior to tenure. The emerging issues in this study were consistent with other research findings from previous studies. The results from this study suggest that district leaders need to create mentoring programs for beginning teachers...|$|R
5|$|The Achaean League {{was upset}} {{that one of}} its members had {{remained}} under Spartan occupation and persuaded the Romans to revisit their <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Sparta's territorial gains intact. The Romans agreed with the Achaeans, as they did not want a strong and re-organized Sparta causing trouble after the Romans left Greece.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{broadcasting}} for {{the season}} began, Duchovny sued Fox and eventually announced his <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the show. As a result, the season {{would be the last}} to feature Duchovny in a full-time capacity until Season 10, although he would return in seasons 8 and 9 as an intermittent main character. Due to this eventual character change, this season would be the last to feature the original opening sequence for the series, as the two later years updated the intro in an attempt to renew and revive the series.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{discussed}} the song at length in a 1987 interview for Musician magazine, {{during which he}} recalls that his mother developed a brain tumour late in 1969 but then recovered for seven months. After hearing of the initial diagnosis in September 1969, Harrison cancelled a recording session with Apple Records artist Jackie Lomax to see her; author Peter Doggett comments that, because {{of the severity of}} this news, Harrison would later have no recollection of how he heard of John Lennon's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the Beatles, on 20 September.|$|E
40|$|This {{phenomenology}} used 21 {{in-depth interviews}} to explore seven African Americans’ experiences {{at the school}} psychology programs they left. The purpose was to investigate what experiences contributed <b>to</b> participants’ <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> programs; if programs used retention strategies and if so, participants’ view of the strategies; and what participants believe might have encouraged their retention. Findings indicate that misalignment between participants’ career aims and their perceptions of school psychology practice as well as poor relationships with faculty and peers contributed <b>to</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> programs. Five participants reported that programs did not utilize retention strategies. Two reported that a sole faculty advocate served as a retention strategy, while one noted funding. Participants cited funding and advisement as strategies that might have encouraged their retention...|$|R

5|$|Historians have divided {{views on}} Stefansson's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the ship. Some of the voyage's {{survivors}} were critical of his seeming indifference to their ordeal {{and the loss}} of their comrades. He escaped official censure, and was publicly honoured for his later work on the expedition despite the Canadian government's reservations about its overall management. Although Bartlett was criticised by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk into the ice, he was hailed as a hero by the public and by his former Karluk shipmates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{years of his}} fight career, and for some time after it ended, he acted as a second for other {{prominent}} fighters and ran a public house.

5|$|Recurring {{injuries}} between 2001 and 2003 {{continued to}} disrupt Berger's career and deprived {{him of a}} presence in the first team, resulting in his <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Liverpool after the expiration of his contract following the conclusion of the 2002–03 season. Berger had been confined to the bench for the duration of his final season when selected, limiting him to four appearances. He left Liverpool, having scored 35 goals during his seven seasons with the club.|$|E
5|$|The {{inevitable}} {{consequence of}} demands for ever greater speed, striking power, and endurance meant that displacement, and hence cost, of dreadnoughts tended to increase. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 imposed {{a limit of}} 35,000 tons on the displacement of capital ships. In subsequent years treaty battleships were commissioned to build up to this limit. Japan's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the Treaty in the 1930s, {{and the arrival of}} the Second World War, eventually made this limit irrelevant.|$|E
5|$|Zahorchak {{announced}} he would resign as education secretary on May 7, 2010. His <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> was spurred by the pending end of the Rendell administration, with the governor leaving the office by January 2011. At {{the time of his}} departure, there were no public school districts in the state with more than half of their students testing below basic levels in state standardized tests, although 14 districts fit that criterion before Zahorchak took the job.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} used {{logistic regression}} to test components of Choice & Lamke’s (1997) two-part decision making model and Hamby’s (2008) holistic risk assessment as predictors in the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> separate from an abusive partner, comparing significant predictors for immigrant (n= 497) and non-immigrant (n= 808) women. Findings demonstrated that immigrant women {{reported higher levels}} of perceived risks/barriers <b>to</b> <b>leaving,</b> and provided some support for the use of a holistic risk assessment in understanding women’s <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> while also demonstrating that immigrant and non-immigrant women have both similarities and differences in the factors that predict leaving. Clinical and policy implications are addressed...|$|R

50|$|After Trapped Inside 's September release, MKIO {{embarked}} on a year-long U.S. tour. While prospects of supporting the album with a tour that long contributed to Nurre's and Bash's <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the band, Bash was able to return in March 2008 when D'Ambra decided <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> D'Ambra parted amicably after eight months with the band, including six months of heavy touring. A few months later, {{near the end of}} the tour, DiDomenico also parted ways with the band. As the tour wound down in August, they played the Warped Tour.|$|R
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{frustrated at}} {{his failure to}} make an impact at Newcastle, Chopra signed for Cardiff City in June 2006 for £500,000. On his <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Newcastle, Chopra stated that he had shown loyalty to the club and expressed his desire to receive the same loyalty from the club. He also added that he would love to return to Newcastle in the future. During the season, Chopra scored 22 goals in 44 matches. He helped the club remain top of the Championship throughout September, earning the Championship Player of the month for September. He was also featured in the PFA Team of the season (an annual award given to a set of 44 footballers in the top four tiers of English football).|$|E
5|$|Experience of Antarctic or Arctic waters {{was almost}} entirely lacking within the 50-strong party {{and there was}} very little special {{training}} in equipment or techniques before the ship set sail. Dogs were taken, as were skis, but the dogs succumbed to disease in the first season. Nevertheless, the dogs' performance impressed Scott, and, despite moral qualms, he implemented the principle of slaughtering dogs for dog-food to increase their range. During an early attempt at ice travel, a blizzard trapped expedition members in their tent and their <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it resulted in the death of George Vince, who slipped over a precipice on 11 March 1902.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore why audit assistants leave the audit profession. By {{including}} both the perceptions held by audit assistants that left the audit profession and the perceptions of audit assistants still working in the audit profession, this study aims to explore how determinants of job satisfaction are associated with <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the audit profession. Design/methodology/approach - To explore the association between determinants of job satisfaction and <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> a survey was developed based on a literature review of determinants of job satisfaction. The survey was sent to both current and former Swedish audit assistants. The subsequent analysis was based on 231 complete surveys, of which 78 were from former audit assistants. Findings - The main finding of this study is that there is a negative association between the choice <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the profession and audit assistants perceptions of the profession and between the choice <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and work-life balance. Another finding was thatmet expectations and Big 4 were found to be positively associated with career change. Originality/value - By approaching both current and former audit assistants, this study contributes to the literature on audit employee turnover by exploring determinants of actual career change, rather than turnover intentions. It also contributes by identifying and testing a variable not previously used as a determinant of job satisfaction, namely, perceptions of the audit profession...|$|R

5|$|The account went viral in 2011 {{and led to}} the reinvigoration of Molyneux's legacy. To many, the two became entwined. Molyneux's {{reputation}} as a dreamer was reclaimed as a positive trait in light of growing opposition to conservative game design, and the parody account became a mouthpiece for that population. The tweets contributed to Molyneux's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Microsoft Game Studios and pursue riskier game ideas. They also inspired a game jam, in which about 1,000 game developers worldwide created about 300 games based on the tweets {{over the course of a}} weekend. The game jam also brought Molyneux fame within a burgeoning indie game movement. Notable games based on the parody account's ideas include Donut County.|$|E

40|$|Turnover is a {{major concern}} of human {{resource}} (HR) managers working with information systems (IS) personnel. Aspects of career incentives, as perceived by the IS employees, are important in their <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> or stay with the organization. We utilize a framework of various job anchors to examine how a sample of IS personnel regard incentives provided by employers and the importance of these in assessing the employee’s intent <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> Job security and a service incentive are most important in reducing this intent. Organizations must address their ability to provide such incentives in order to retain their IS employees...|$|R
