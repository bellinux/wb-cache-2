A concurrent algorithm may require certain patterns of communication among objects. Naming systems differ significantly in the patterns of communication that they support, and this diversity suggests the existence of efficiency tradeoffs and specialization among the various approaches. To enable the impact of these differences upon the structure of concurrent computations to be examined systematically, we present a taxonomy of <b>naming</b> <b>systems</b> that isolates a small set of fundamental <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> properties, and ranks <b>naming</b> <b>systems</b> in (partial) order of the expressiveness they derive from their properties.

40|$|Submitted for {{publication}} Abstract * Names or identifiers {{are central to}} any network or distributed systems architecture {{because they are the}} handles for remote, ephemeral or non-existing entities. Typically names range from a location independent identifier, to an address, to a route to a location. All are means of identifying remote entities. Because naming is so central to remote communications systems, we take the position in this paper that it is critically important to select or design <b>naming</b> <b>systems</b> to meet the broader design criteria of the systems in which they will be used. There are many <b>naming</b> <b>systems</b> in existence, so the best <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> for a particular situation may already exist. A <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> consists not only of the schemes for defining and assigning names, but also for resolving them. This paper lays out the criteria by which one can effectively design or evaluate a <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> and its components, which is likely to provide a core function of a distributed or network system. It then lays out four design principles for <b>naming</b> <b>systems.</b> Finally, it considers the design criteria and tradeoffs in a series of specific <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> examples. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the construction of}} a descriptive <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> for an internet environment. Descriptive <b>naming</b> <b>systems</b> allow clients to identify a set objects by description. In a world where information is perfect, this amounts to a simple database query. However, descriptive <b>naming</b> <b>systems</b> operate in an imperfect world: clients may provide inaccurate descriptions, the database may contain out-of-date or incomplete information, the database may be highly distributed, and so on. Traditional strategies for handling imperfect information approach the problem from the database's perspective; i. e., queries are resolved according to a method determined by the database designer. This thesis presents a model, called a preference hierarchy, that allows the client to define the meaning of a preferred answer. A preferred answer is computed using knowledge about the quality of information in the database and in the query. Specifically, clients provide the <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> with a description of an object and some meta-information that {{describes the}} client's beliefs about the query and the <b>naming</b> <b>system.</b> This meta-information is an ordering on a set of perfect-world approximations and it describes the preferred methods for accommodating imperfect information. The description is then resolved in a way that respects the preferred approximations. The preference hierarchy may be used to solve problems associated with some forms of imperfect information that exist in descriptive <b>naming</b> <b>systems.</b> It also provides a foundation for designing and comparing various <b>naming</b> <b>systems.</b> For example, the preference hierarchy allows us to compare <b>naming</b> <b>systems</b> based on how discriminating they are, and to identify the class of names for which a given <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> is sound and complete. A study of several example <b>naming</b> <b>systems</b> demonstrates how the preference hierarchy {{can be used as a}} formal tool for designing <b>naming</b> <b>systems.</b> Univers is a generic attribute-based name server that implements the preference hierarchy model. It provides a foundation upon which a variety of high-level naming services can be built. It is a platform for constructing an internet-wide descriptive <b>naming</b> <b>system.</b> This thesis describes several aspects of its implementation and demonstrates how various descriptive naming services [...] including a global white-pages service, a local yellow-pages services, and a conventional name-to-address mapper [...] can be built on top of Univers...|$|R
