40|$|Previous {{studies of}} eye gaze {{have shown that}} when looking at images {{containing}} human faces, observers tend to rapidly focus on the facial regions. But is this true of other high-level image features as well? We here investigate {{the extent to which}} natural scenes containing <b>faces,</b> <b>text</b> elements, and cell phones - as a suitable control - attract attention by tracking the eye movements of subjects in two types of tasks - free viewing and search. We observed that subjects in free-viewing conditions look at <b>faces</b> and <b>text</b> 16. 6 and 11. 1 times more than similar regions normalized for size and position of the <b>face</b> and <b>text.</b> In terms of attracting gaze, text is almost as effective as faces. Furthermore, it is difﬁcult to avoid looking at <b>faces</b> and <b>text</b> even when doing so imposes a cost. We also found that subjects took longer in making their initial saccade when they were told to avoid faces/text and their saccades landed on a non-face/non-text object. We reﬁne a well-known bottom–up computer model of saliency-driven attention that includes conspicuity maps for color, orientation, and intensity by adding high-level semantic information (i. e., the location of <b>faces</b> or <b>text)</b> and demonstrate that this signiﬁcantly improves the ability to predict eye ﬁxations in natural images.

With the advent of broadband networking, every consumer will have video programs available on-line {{as well as in}} the traditional distribution channels. Systems that help in content management have to discern between different categories of video in order to provide for fast retrieval. In this paper we present a novel method for video classification based on <b>face</b> and <b>text</b> trajectories. This is based on the observation that in different TV categories there are different <b>face</b> and <b>text</b> trajectory patterns. <b>Face</b> and <b>text</b> tracking is applied to arbitrary video clips to extract <b>faces</b> and <b>text</b> trajectories.

40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{framework}} for parsing images into regions and objects. In this framework, the detection {{and recognition of}} objects proceed simultaneously with image segmentation in a competitive and cooperative manner. We illustrate our approach on natural images of complex city scenes where the objects of primary interest are <b>faces</b> and <b>text.</b> This method makes use of bottom-up proposals combined with top-down generative models using the Data Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) algorithm which is guaranteed to converge to the optimal estimate asymptotically. More precisely, we define generative models for <b>faces,</b> <b>text,</b> and generic regions – e. g. shading, texture, and clutter. These models are activated by bottom-up proposals. The proposals for <b>faces</b> and <b>text</b> are learnt using a probabilistic version of AdaBoost. The DDMCMC combines reversible jump and diffusion dynamics to enable the generative models to explain the input images in a competitive and cooperative manner. Our experiments illustrate the advantages and importance of combining bottom-up and top-down models and of performing segmentation and object detection/recognition simultaneously. 1...|$|R

40|$|Eye {{movement}} {{studies have}} confirmed that overt atten-tion is highly biased towards <b>faces</b> and <b>text</b> regions in im-ages. In this paper we explore a novel problem of predicting <b>face</b> and <b>text</b> regions in images using eye tracking data from multiple subjects. The problem is challenging as we aim to predict the semantics (face/text/background) only from eye tracking data without utilizing any image information. The proposed algorithm spatially clusters eye tracking data ob-tained in an image into different coherent groups and sub-sequently models {{the likelihood of the}} clusters containing <b>faces</b> and <b>text</b> using a fully connected Markov Random Field (MRF). Given the eye tracking data from a test image, it pre-dicts potential face/head (humans, dogs and cats) and text locations reliably. Furthermore, the approach can be used to select regions of interest for further analysis by object de-tectors for <b>faces</b> and <b>text.</b> The hybrid eye position/object de-tector approach achieves better detection performance and reduced computation time compared to using only the ob-ject detection algorithm. We also present a new eye tracking dataset on 300 images selected from ICDAR, Street-view, Flickr and Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset from 15 subjects. 1...|$|R

It describes a low cost Discovery mission to investigate the upper atmosphere of Mars and to understand {{the manner in which}} Mars has evolved over geologic time. In keeping with the innovative philosophy permeating the Discovery Program and in order to minimize the burden of reading an extensive prose exposition, a new presentation format has been adopted. The format involves a series of view graphs with <b>facing</b> <b>text.</b> The view graphs form the basis of a complete oral presentation of the MAUDEE mission and the <b>facing</b> <b>text</b> provides more detailed, but still brief, explanatory descriptions. Readers can scan the view graphs and/or read the <b>facing</b> <b>text</b> at their discretion. The oral presentation of this study was given to code SL personnel at NASA Headquarters on February 23, 1994. MAUDEE is an essential component of the Mars Exploration Program. It provides the information required to understand the evolution of the planet via the escape of volatiles. It provides the key measurements needed to understand the upper atmosphere of the last of the three terrestrial planets to be so studied. It connects and supplements investigations based on other Mars missions: Mars Surveyor, Planet-B and Mars- 96. The MAUDEE mission plan involves a combination of remote and in-situ sensors, housed in three instrument packages. The sensors make measurements of the atmospheric regions between 60 - 200 km. These instruments are based on extensive heritage from Earth explorers and Pioneer Venus. The mission scenario has several phases and employs aerobraking maneuvers to lower initial apoapsis, thereby reducing fuel requirements. The spacecraft has body-mounted solar cells, enabling deep diving into the Martian atmosphere. The orbital inclination allows for pole-to-pole latitudinal sweeps in an initial elliptical phase, followed by a circular phase affording detailed diurnal measurements. The nominal mission duration at Mars is one Mars year...|$|R
40|$|Producing {{off-line}} captions for {{the deaf}} and hearing impaired people is a labor-intensive task that can require up to 18 hours of production per hour of film. Captions are placed manually close to the region of interest but it must avoid masking human <b>faces,</b> <b>texts</b> or any moving objects that might be relevant to the story flow. Our goal is to use image processing techniques to reduce the off-line caption production process by automatically placing the captions on the proper consecutive frames. We implemented a computer-assisted captioning software tool which integrates detection of <b>faces,</b> <b>texts</b> and visual motion regions. The near frontal faces are detected using a cascade of weak classifier and tracked through a particle filter. Then, frames are scanned to perform text spotting and build a region map suitable for text recognition. Finally, motion mapping {{is based on the}} Lukas-Kanade optical flow algorithm and provides MPEG- 7 motion descriptors. The combined detected items are then fed to a rule-based algorithm to determine the best captions localization for the related sequences of frames. This paper focuses on the defined rules to assist the human captioners and the results of a user evaluation for this approach.
