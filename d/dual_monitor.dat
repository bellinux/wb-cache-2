40|$|Objective: Systematic reviews (SRs) are the {{cornerstone}} of evidence-based medicine. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of using two computer screens on the efficiency of conducting SRs. Study Design and Setting: A cohort of reviewers before and after using <b>dual</b> <b>monitors</b> were compared with a control group that did not use <b>dual</b> <b>monitors.</b> The outcomes were time spent for abstract screening, full-text screening and data extraction, and inter-rater agreement. We adopted multivariate difference-in-differences linear regression models. Results: A total of 60 SRs conducted by 54 reviewers were included in this analysis. We found a significant reduction of 23. 81 minutes per article in data extraction in the intervention group relative to the control group (95 % confidence interval: 46. 03, 1. 58, P 5 0. 04), which was a 36. 85 % reduction in time. There {{was no significant difference}} in time spent on abstract screening, full-text screening, or interrater agreement between the two groups. Conclusion: Using <b>dual</b> <b>monitors</b> when conducting SRs is associated with significant reduction of time spent on data extraction. No significant difference was observed on time spent on abstract screening or full-text screening. Using <b>dual</b> <b>monitors</b> is one strategy that may improve the efficiency of conducting SRs...|$|R

50|$|While {{most modern}} {{graphics}} cards have support for <b>dual</b> <b>monitors</b> and can expand a desktop across three screens, 3D games are generally {{limited to a}} single monitor. The GXM uses the standard Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) structure to communicate its capabilities to the graphics card just as a monitor does. However, the GXM's resolution includes all pixels in the three monitors. If the TripleHead2Go were hooked up to three monitors with 800×600 resolution, the TripleHead2Go would report itself as a single monitor with 2400×600 resolution. The graphics card then sends out a 2400×600 signal which the TripleHead2Go divides and distributes to the appropriate monitors.|$|R

We find firms with greater asymmetric information are likely to adopt a unitary board. Firms with a high potential for private benefit extraction are likely to adopt dual boards. Firms well monitored by financial market and institutional forces {{are less likely to}} have dual boards.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} is proposed to track the perceptual behaviour of radiologists when they examine mammographic images displayed on large <b>dual</b> clinical <b>monitors.</b> Zooming and panning are inevitably performed by the radiologist to examine such large images by using the DICOM viewing software. Such image manipulating movements on the target displays makes eye tracking techniques difficult to perform and also {{the size of the}} <b>dual</b> clinical <b>monitors</b> makes existing eye tracking techniques generally inadequate. Hence a method using the Smart Eye Pro eye tracker and optical character recognition techniques was designed to relate the recorded radiologists’ eye gaze behaviour on the monitors to the actual zoomed and panned medical image areas. This then allows clinical studies involving radiologists interacting with these mammographic images to be successfully carried out...|$|R

5000|$|Due {{to the use}} of {{different}} address mappings for different modes, it is possible to have a monochrome adapter (i.e. MDA or Hercules) and a color adapter such as the VGA, EGA, or CGA installed in the same machine. At the beginning of the 1980s, this was typically used to display Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets in high-resolution text on a monochrome display and associated graphics on a low-resolution CGA display simultaneously. Many programmers also used such a setup with the monochrome card displaying debugging information while a program ran in graphics mode on the other card. Several debuggers, like Borland's Turbo Debugger, D86 (by Alan J. Cox) and Microsoft's CodeView could work in a <b>dual</b> <b>monitor</b> setup. Either Turbo Debugger or CodeView could be used to debug Windows. There were also DOS device drivers such as ox.sys, which implemented a serial interface simulation on the monochrome display and, for example, allowed the user to receive crash messages from debugging versions of Windows without using an actual serial terminal. It is also possible to use the [...] "MODE MONO" [...] command at the DOS prompt to redirect the output to the monochrome display. When a monochrome adapter was not present, it was possible to use the 0xB000-0xB7FF address space as additional memory for other programs (for example by adding the line [...] "DEVICE=EMM386.EXE I=B000-B7FF" [...] into config.sys, this memory would be made available to programs that can be [...] "loaded high", that is loaded into high memory.) ...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose—In animal {{models of}} stroke, {{functional}} improvement has been obtained after stem cell transplantation. Successful therapy {{depends largely on}} achieving a robust and targeted cell engraftment, with intraarterial (IA) injection being a potentially attractive route of administration. We assessed the suitability of laser Doppler flow (LDF) signal measurements and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for noninvasive <b>dual</b> <b>monitoring</b> of targeted IA cell delivery. Methods—Transient cerebral ischemia was induced in adult Wistar rats (n 25) followed by IA or intravenous (IV) injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide. Cell infusion was monitored in real time with transcranial laser Doppler flowmetry while cellular delivery was assessed with MRI in vivo (4. 7 T) and ex vivo (9. 4 T). Results—Successful delivery of magnetically labeled MSCs could be readily visualized with MRI after IA but not IV injection. IA stem cell injection during acute stroke resulted in a high variability of cerebral engraftment. The amount of LDF reduction during cell infusion (up to 80 %) was found to correlate well with the degree of intracerebral engraftment, with low LDF values being associated with significant morbidity. Conclusions—High cerebral engraftment rates are associated with impeded cerebral blood flow. Noninvasive dual-modality imaging enables monitoring of targeted cell delivery, and through interactive adjustment may improve th...|$|R
