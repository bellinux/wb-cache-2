5000|$|The {{definition}} {{centered on}} a zero-sum game in the consumptions is originated from contributions of Ugo Pagano: When one party's level of consumption is positive, then {{at least one other}} party's level of consumption must be negative. However while the dimension of positional good is binary, the net (utility) impact of a positional good may be positive, zero or negative. The individual utility derives from the individual preferences on the level of consumption. If reasonable conditions - positive (negative) consumptions imply positive (negative) utilities - hold, then a second kind of definition of positional goods may be formulated: Zero-sum game in the payoffs. Positional goods are goods whose utility of their consumptions is relative (negatively) to the consumption of the others. A last definition of positional good derives from the so-called [...] "Veblen effect", which is witnessed whenever individuals are willing to pay higher prices for functionally <b>equivalent</b> <b>goods</b> (a very significant example is the luxury goods market). The Veblen effect also implies that a sufficient decrease in price leads not to an increase in demand, but to a decrease, because the social status derived from acquiring the goods in question may fall (remember the role of gap among San Gimignano's towers!). In this respect, positional goods are goods for which the satisfaction derives (at least in part) from higher pricing. This brings us to an intriguing parallel between positional goods, such as [...] "luxury goods", and what are known as [...] "Giffen goods". Rae observed {{that in the case of}} [...] "mere luxuries", while a halving of the price would require a doubling in the number of units purchased, in order to satisfy vanity to the same extent, a reduction of the price to a small fraction of its previous level would reduce demand to zero. Cournot also admitted that some goods [...] "of whim and luxury ... are only desirable on account of their rarity and of the high price which is the consequence thereof ... in this case a great fall in price would almost annihilate the demand" [...] (cf. Schneider).|$|E

40|$|P 2 P file-sharing {{tools such}} as Napster or KaZaA allow the easy {{distribution}} of files, mostly music {{in the form of}} MP 3 s, much to the dismay of the record industry as well as of individual artists who fear massive losses of their revenues.

In this paper we explore an alternative usage scenario of P 2 P networks, centered around the idea of creating a trading community with its own currency. These so-called alternative currencies or local exchange trading systems share much in common with the P 2 P philosophy in that they trade goods or services for <b>equivalent</b> <b>goods</b> or services.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{distinction}} between active waste and passive waste as determinants {{of the cost of}} public services. Active waste entails utility for the public decision maker (as in the case of bribery) whereas passive waste does not (as in the case of ineffciency due to red tape). To assess the empirical relevance of both forms of waste, we analyze purchases of standardized goods by Italian public bodies and exploit a policy experiment associated with a national procurement agency. A revealed preference argument implies that if public bodies with higher costs are more likely to buy from the procurement agency rather than from traditional suppliers, cost differences {{are more likely to be}} due to passive waste. We find that: (i) Some public bodies pay systematically more than others for observationally <b>equivalent</b> <b>goods</b> and such price differences are sizeable; (ii) Differences are correlated with governance structure: the central administration pays at least 22 % more than semi-autonomous agencies (local government is at an intermediate level); (iii) The variation in prices across public bodies is principally due to variation in passive rather than active waste; (iv) Passive waste accounts for 83 % of total estimated waste. ...|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of this document, the {{following}} definitions apply: 2. 1 (a) “Request for Information”: A Request for Information (RFI) is used on high value and/or complex purchases to identify the interest of potentially qualified suppliers in the marketplace and/or for budgetary pricing. An RFI does not form a contractual commitment. No award results from an RFI. An RFI may lead to an RFP. (b) “Request for Proposal”: A Request for Proposal (RFP) is a competitive bid process that is undertaken typically for higher dollar value and/or complex transactions where factors in addition to price will be used to make the final purchasing decision, e. g. qualifications, experience, etc. It identifies goods, services or research objectives with mandatory and optional requirements and may be linked to a previously issued Request for Information (RFI). An RFP is normally awarded based on a weighting of evaluation criteria, including price.

40|$|Should an {{informed}} seller lead {{with the best}} or worst good in a sequential auction? Considering the sale of two stochastically <b>equivalent</b> <b>goods</b> over two periods, we show that if second period buyers can observe the first period price, the seller has an incentive to lead with the best good so as to send a positive signal {{about the quality of}} the following good. This result holds even though the goods' values are independent because the seller's sequencing strategy endogenously generates correlation in the quality of the goods across periods. In contrast, a best for last strategy may not be as credible as the seller has an incentive to then sell his better good early. We also show that ex-ante expected profits from either of these strategies is higher than a babbling strategy of randomly sequencing the sale, even when the second period buyers do not observe the first period price. We discuss implications for the choice of sequential versus simultaneous auctions, the strategic choice of auction houses, the sequential auction of items of varying expected quality, the declining price anomaly observed in auction data, and the effects of selection bias on empirical studies of privatization auctions. ...|$|E

This allows the elimination of confounding effects associated with the specific good employed. In our case information dispels some of the uncertainty about a potential gain from a gamble. So, the approximate value of the message can be inferred once the individual measure of risk aversion is known.
