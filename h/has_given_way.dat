5|$|Man's {{inability}} to live God's words makes the Avatar's teaching a mockery. Instead of practicing the compassion he taught, man has waged wars in his name. Instead of living the humility, purity, and truth of his words, man <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to hatred, greed, and violence. Because {{man has been}} deaf to the principles and precepts laid down by God in the past, in this present Avataric form, I observe silence.|$|E

Changes in {{the game in the}} last decade of the 20th century have made attaining 300career wins difficult, perhaps more so than during the mid 20thcentury. The four-man starting rotation <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to a five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer chances to pick up wins. No pitcher reached 20wins in a non strike-shortened year for the first time in 2006; this was repeated in 2009 and 2017.|$|E

5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of feeder lines to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a difficult time economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro feeder lines have been proposed in recent years, however, {{the role of the}} network <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.|$|E
5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, {{there is no single}} test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).|$|E

25|$|The {{church is}} built of ragstone rubble with some flint and has {{limestone}} dressings; {{there is also}} some Roman and Tudor brickwork. The south wall of the south aisle shows the original rubble with red Tudor brickwork on the top, three to four feet in depth and above the windows. In the south-east corner, the stone <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> and been replaced by Tudor brick, reinforced by a Tudor brick buttress. At some time, the east wall of the north aisle had cracked badly and been repaired very roughly by Tudor brickwork above the window.|$|E

This breakthrough <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to the donation of human embryos as a common practice similar to other donations such as blood and major organ donations. At the time of this announcement the event was captured by major news carriers and fueled healthy debate and discussion on this practice which impacted the future of reproductive medicine by creating a platform for further advancements in woman's health.|$|E

25|$|Making {{and sharing}} mooncakes {{is one of}} the {{hallmark}} traditions of this festival. In Chinese culture, a round shape symbolizes completeness and reunion. Thus, the sharing and eating of round mooncakes among family members during the week of the festival signifies the completeness and unity of families. In some areas of China, there is a tradition of making mooncakes during the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival. The senior person in that household would cut the mooncakes into pieces and distribute them to each family member, signifying family reunion. In modern times, however, making mooncakes at home <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to the more popular custom of giving mooncakes to family members, although the meaning of maintaining familial unity remains.|$|E
25|$|However, on most railway {{vehicles}} using overhead wire, {{the trolley}} pole <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to the bow collector or, later, the pantograph, a folding metal device that presses a wide contact pan against the overhead wire. While {{more complex than}} the trolley pole, the pantograph has the advantage of being almost free from dewiring, being more stable at high speed, and being easier to raise and lower automatically. Also, on double-ended trams, they eliminate the need to manually turn the trolley pole when changing direction (although this disadvantage can be overcome to some extent through the use of trolley reversers). The use of pantographs (or bow collectors) exclusively also eliminates the need for wire frogs (switches in the overhead wiring) to make sure the pole goes in the correct direction at junctions.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch Low Saxon dialect area, {{comprising}} {{the provinces of}} Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel, {{and parts of the}} province of Gelderland as well. The IJssel roughly forms the linguistic watershed here. This group, which is not Low Franconian but instead Low Saxon and close to neighbouring Low German, has been elevated by the Netherlands (and by Germany) to the legal status of streektaal (regional language) according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. It is regarded as Dutch for a number of reasons. From the 14th to 15th century onward, its urban centers (Deventer, Zwolle, Kampen, Zutphen and Doesburg) have been increasingly influenced by the western written Dutch and became a linguistically mixed area. From the 17th century onward, it was gradually integrated into the Dutch language area. Dutch Low Saxon used to be {{at one end of the}} Low German dialect continuum. However, the national border <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to dialect boundaries coinciding with a political border, because the traditional dialects are strongly influenced by the national standard varieties. Cross-the-border dialects now separated by a plain gap also include South Guelderish and Limburgish on the Dutch side of the border and Meuse-Rhenish on the German side of the border.|$|E

500|$|The book's fiftieth {{anniversary in}} 2007 {{prompted}} a reevaluation {{of the book}} from some critics. Yvonne Coppard, reviewing the fiftieth anniversary edition in Carousel magazine, wondered if {{the popularity of the}} Cat and his [...] "delicious naughty behavior" [...] will endure another fifty years. Coppard wrote, [...] "The innocent ignorance of bygone days <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to an all-embracing, almost paranoid awareness of child protection issues.

500|$|Our {{understanding}} of the mechanism of drug-induced receptor activation and receptor theory and the biochemical definition of a receptor antagonist continues to evolve. The two-state model of receptor activation <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to multistate models with intermediate conformational states. The discovery of functional selectivity and that ligand-specific receptor conformations occur and can affect interaction of receptors with different second messenger systems may mean that drugs can be designed to activate some of the downstream functions of a receptor but not others. [...] This means efficacy may actually depend on where that receptor is expressed, altering the view that efficacy at a receptor is receptor-independent property of a drug.|$|E
500|$|Much {{critical}} {{attention has}} been paid to the film's focus on sexuality and gender identity. Sharalyn Orbaugh has noted that the opening scene of Ghost in the Shell begins with the [...] "perfect paradoxical introduction to a narrative that is all about the nature of sex/gender identity and self-identity in general in a future world where sexual reproduction <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to mechanical replication". Motoko's female identity and appearance are countered by an autonomous subjectivity, resulting in a cyborg body without reproductive organs which cannot menstruate. Orbaugh describes the juxtaposition of the opening scene depicting the creation of Motoko's body and to her lack of menstruation as setting the theme of [...] "reproductive sexuality in a posthuman subject".|$|E
