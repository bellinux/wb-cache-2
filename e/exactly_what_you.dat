25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long as you know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E

25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If you call me a stupid son-of-a-bitch, I know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean. But if you call me a baka-yarō, I cannot be so sure of what you mean. The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E

Songs in the key of B-movie, with faux-horror lyrics and hook-laden riffs that work surprisingly well for their simplicity." [...] Sweden-based English-language site Global Domination gave an enthusiastically positive review, commenting: [...] "Because damn people, this album {{is so great that}} I fucking implore you to get both the album AND the DVD." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Billboard, [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] is [...] "brimming {{with sexual}} innuendo". In the song, [...] "Madonna yearns {{for a man}} to open her lock with his key. And yes, that means <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think it does." [...] The lyrics puts Madonna in a more direct {{position}} expressing her sexual desires for her man according to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández in the line [...] "If you gave me half a chance you'd see; My desire burning inside of me." [...] According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] is written in the time signature of common time with a medium funk tempo of 112 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F major with Madonna's voice spanning from A3 to B4. The song follows a basic sequence of F–E9–E/G–Gm7–F as its chord progression.|$|E

500|$|Television critics {{tended to}} view [...] "Cocktails" [...] positively. Kevin Fitzpatrick of UGO Networks praised the episode's writing and directing, {{explaining}} that [...] " [...] {{of the credit}} goes to Paul Lieberstein for his ruthlessly funny writing, but ol' J.J. really knows how to run with the material and make awkward situations just that much more painful with his direction, {{one of the best}} episodes of the series." [...] Buddy TV writer Oscar Dahl noted that [...] "besides a couple of crafty camera moves, his work was mostly invisible, which is <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want from a director on The Office." [...] IGN's Brian Zoromski appreciated the spotlight on female characters Jan, Pam, and Karen, and thought there were [...] "quite a few great little moments this episode," [...] including [...] "a great Creed moment as he revealed he runs a fake ID company out of his car." [...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West enjoyed Karen conning Jim at the party, called Rashida Jones' performance [...] "brilliantly played"; West also liked Pam's newfound confidence, but believed she was [...] "dumb" [...] for telling Roy of her kiss with Jim.|$|E
500|$|... "Dumpweed" [...] {{kicks off}} the record, and explores sexual frustration. The song is based around the hook [...] "I need a girl that I can train," [...] as in dog training. DeLonge, the song's {{primarily}} lyricist, explains {{the song in}} a 2000 tour booklet: [...] "Girls are so much smarter than guys and can see the future as well as never forget the past. So that leaves the dog as the only thing men are smarter than." [...] The song is a [...] "callow complaint about girls not always doing <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> wish they would," [...] and is followed by Hoppus' [...] "Don't Leave Me," [...] a song about a breakup, in irony. Hoppus wrote the song in ten minutes. The guitar swell preceding the second chorus is actually a digital reversal of the delaying guitar preceding it. [...] "Aliens Exist" [...] originates from DeLonge's interest in UFOs and conspiracy theories. [...] "Going Away to College" [...] was written in ten minutes by Hoppus while at home sick on Valentine's Day 1999. While watching the movie Can't Hardly Wait, Hoppus {{began to think about}} [...] "how much it sucks when people are in love in high school" [...] and are forced to be separated after graduation by different colleges in different cities. Since it was recorded late in production, the band {{had to go back to}} Los Angeles to record Barker's drum track.|$|E
500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I can hear you knocking at the front door/ And I know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give me something to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out." [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy" [...] referencing her first singles [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998) and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone (2003) and Circus (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000). The [...] "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" [...] was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{most of whom}} seemed to have judged it on different criteria from their normal {{because it was a}} holiday episode. The Atlantic Kevin Fallon may have called it [...] "sickly oversweet", but maintained [...] "that's <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want at Christmas". His colleague Patrick Burns wrote, [...] "Holiday episodes tread a dangerous line between sweet and saccharine, but this episode splits the difference perfectly." [...] The title of the article they wrote with Meghan Brown, [...] "Glee Does Christmas: Cheesy but Charming", found echoes in other reviews: both Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times and Anthony Benigno of the Daily News also thought the episode was quite cheesy, but Benigno characterized it as [...] "the good kind of cheese; the kind you'll eat for antipasti before grandma and grandpa bring out the roast beef on Christmas dinner", and Reiter's bottom line was that it [...] "may not have been the most wonderful episode of the year, but it did feature moments that twinkled and shined like the lovingly trimmed family tree." [...] Time James Poniewozik was less enthusiastic when he noted that Glee delivered an episode [...] "that touched on all the requisite holiday bases but that felt perfunctory", and added that it was [...] "generally ho-ho-hum". Robert Canning of IGN gave it a [...] "great" [...] 8 out of 10, but stated that [...] "the episode as a whole was lacking just a bit to turn it into an absolute classic", and The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave the episode a [...] "B−" [...] and wrote, [...] "I guess I'd say that I thought the episode worked moment-to-moment, without working as an overall narrative", but also stated that it was [...] "positively filled with stupid moments".|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{reported}} that the Valentine's Day theme in the episode [...] "was <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would expect from a series that thrives on uncomfortable romantic situations." [...] He added {{that there was a}} lot to enjoy from [...] "St. Valentine's Day," [...] opining that it was a [...] "very funny episode" [...] and that it had [...] "plenty of get moments and memorable lines to make the weak endings a minor factor." [...] Canning rated the episode an 8.4 out of 10. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that the episode was [...] "structurally and tonally", but disliked the way the show featured Jon Hamm, as he believed the show was not giving him enough to do besides being [...] "handsome." [...] Nonetheless, Sepinwall enjoyed the story between Liz and Drew in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] writing that it was a [...] "better effort" [...] than shown in the previous episode, [...] "Generalissimo". As with Sepinwall, Maureen Ryan for the Chicago Tribune hoped the show would use Hamm [...] "better" [...] than demonstrated in his first two appearances. Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett wrote that she liked the way the episode handled the Valentine's Day theme, however, was not complimentary towards the way Tina Fey and Hamm were featured in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] with her observing, [...] "the future for TV's most promisingly delicious couple... might not be so sweet." [...] Before the airing of the episode, Barrett very much liked the pairing of the two characters. Kevin D. Thompson for The Palm Beach Post was complimentary about the episode's theme, and praised 30 Rock for displaying [...] "one of the best" [...] episodes he has ever seen. Jeremy Median of Paste praised the episodes [...] "Generalissimo" [...] and [...] "St. Valentine's Day", concluding, [...] "There's no possible way to mention every funny joke or one-liner in the past two episodes. The show is just too lightning-quick for that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kyle Orland of Ars Technica {{noted that}} the various ways of {{achieving}} a high score gave the game an aspect similar to puzzle games. Garrett Martin of the Boston Herald give high marks for the game's cutscenes and stated they were [...] "good enough to warrant a Cartoon Network TV show." [...] The reviewer from GameTrailers compared the game to a combination between the Nintendo game Ninja Gaiden and the modern open-world game [...] He also lauded the controls and stated that the scheme [...] "bends and yields {{to allow you to}} do <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want precisely when you want to." ...|$|E
2500|$|After 1965, Brown's bandleader and {{arranger}} was Alfred [...] "Pee Wee" [...] Ellis. Ellis credits Clyde Stubblefield's {{adoption of}} New Orleans drumming techniques, {{as the basis}} of modern funk: [...] "If, in a studio, you said 'play it funky' that could imply almost anything. But 'give me a New Orleans beat' – you got <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> wanted. And Clyde Stubblefield was just the epitome of this funky drumming." [...] Stewart states that the popular feel was passed along from [...] "New Orleans—through James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s." [...] Concerning the various funk motifs, Stewart states: [...] "This model, it should be noted, is different from a time line (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Gutenberg's time, inks used by scribes {{to produce}} manuscripts were water-based. Gutenberg {{developed}} an oil-based ink that would better adhere to his metal type. His ink was primarily carbon, but {{also had a}} high metallic content, with copper, lead, and titanium predominating. Head of collections at the British Library, Dr Kristian Jensen, described it thus: [...] "if you look (at the pages of The Gutenberg Bible) closely you will see {{this is a very}} shiny surface. When you write you use a water based ink, [...] you put your pen into it and it runs off. [...] Now [...] if you print that's <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> don't want. One of Gutenberg's inventions was an ink which wasn't ink, it's a varnish. So what we call printer's ink is actually a varnish, and that means it sticks to its surface." ...|$|E

"The Carolina {{fans that}} week were {{carrying}} around a poster {{with the image}} of a tiger with a gamecock standing on top of it, holding the tiger's tail as if he was steering the tiger by the tail," [...] Jay McCormick said. [...] "Naturally, the Clemson guys didn't take too kindly to that, and on Wednesday and again on Thursday, there were sporadic fistfights involving brass knuckles and other objects and so forth, some of which resulted, according to the newspapers, in blood being spilled and persons having to seek medical assistance. [...] After the game on Thursday, the Clemson guys frankly told the Carolina students that if you bring this poster, which is insulting to us, to the big parade on Friday, you're going to be in trouble. And naturally, of course, the Carolina students brought the poster to the parade.

2500|$|The {{formation}} of a College for engineering, or technical university, was quite a difficult project, as the entire subject of engineering education was obscure. A small number of colleges had commenced this, such as Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey and Harvard, Yale, and RPI in New York; MIT and Cornell were just being founded. The University of Pennsylvania opened a small school in 1852, for mining and materials, but which had closed {{at the onset of}} the Civil War. As W. Ross Yates notes: [...] "No one knew with certainty how many years a course [...] in engineering should take, or even what branches of engineering should be included within a university. The relationship between theory and practice was hazy." [...] A statement made years later by industrialist and Lehigh Trustee Eckley B. Coxe summarizes the problem succinctly: [...] "Not knowing <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want to do or the material you have to do it with, what is the best way of doing it?" ...|$|E
