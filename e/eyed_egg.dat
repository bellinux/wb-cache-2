University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2002 The {{effect of}} egg weight on {{survival}} {{and development of}} pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) embryos, alevins, and fry was analyzed; in addition, embryo survival was investigated in relation to additive genetic variation. Embryonic survival to eyeing, development time to hatch, yolk weight, somatic tissue weight, yolk use rate, somatic tissue growth rate, and the survival of first-feeding fry was recorded relative to egg weight. The analyses demonstrated significant egg weight effects on development time to hatch, yolk weight, somatic tissue weight, yolk use rate, and somatic tissue growth rate on alevins. Weight and length of post-emergent fry (17 weeks post-ponding) were also significantly affected by initial egg weight. However, egg weight did not affect survival of <b>eyed</b> <b>eggs</b> or fry.

Egg samples for scanning analyses were collected on day 30 of incubation at the eyed stage after the first bath in the iodophor solution, and then at the end of incubation. Egg surface images were analyzed for the number of bacteria, the presence of hyphae, and the egg surface area covered with sediments. No statistically significant differences were noted in embryo survival rates in the groups that were disinfected. The highest number of bacteria was observed on egg surfaces which had not been disinfected prior to hatching. A significant amount of sediment was observed on the eggs during incubation.

40|$|Background  Due to {{selective}} breeding, domesticated {{and wild}} Atlantic salmon are genetically diverged, {{which raises concerns}} about farmed escapees having the potential to alter the genetic composition of wild populations and thereby disrupting local adaptation. Documenting transcriptional differences between wild and domesticated stocks under controlled conditions {{is one way to}} explore the consequences of domestication and selection. We compared the transcriptomes of wild and domesticated Atlantic salmon embryos, by using a custom 44 k oligonucleotide microarray to identify perturbed gene pathways between the two stocks, and to document the inheritance patterns of differentially-expressed genes by examining gene expression in their reciprocal hybrids.   Results  Data from 24 array interrogations were analysed: four reciprocal cross types (W♀×W♂, D♀×W♂; W♀×D♂, D♀×D♂) ×six biological replicates. A common set of 31, 491 features on the microarrays passed quality control, of which about 62 % were assigned a KEGG Orthology number. A total of 6037 distinct genes were identified for gene-set enrichment/pathway analysis. The most highly enriched functional groups that were perturbed between the two stocks were cellular signalling and immune system, ribosome and RNA transport, and focal adhesion and gap junction pathways, relating to cell communication and cell adhesion molecules. Most transcripts that were differentially expressed between the stocks were governed by additive gene interaction (33 to 42 %). Maternal dominance and over-dominance were also prevalent modes of inheritance, with no convincing evidence for a stock effect.   Conclusions  Our data indicate that even at this relatively early developmental stage, transcriptional differences exist between the two stocks and affect pathways that are relevant to wild versus domesticated environments. Many of the identified differentially perturbed pathways are involved in organogenesis, which is expected to be an active process at the <b>eyed</b> <b>egg</b> stage. The dominant effects are more largely due to the maternal line than to the origin of the stock.

Also, 161 mixed kidney and spleen specimens {{were taken from}} 805 of these fish. Furthermore, 139 tumor tissues observed among 4, 288 fish were employed for virus inspection. Blood smears prepared from 660 fish were employed in microscopical examination for evidence of VEN, and thin sections of blood of these were observed by electron microscopy. Four viruses have been isolated {{during the course of}} this investigation. IHNV was found in ovarian fluid of chum salmon from Abashiri River in 1976. During the period from 1976 through 1986, IHNV has been recovered 9 times from fish at 7 collection sites. OMV was first discovered in 1978 from masu salmon at Otobe Salmon Hatchery. At all sites permitting collection of 60 specimens with the exception of 3 hatchery, OMV has subsequently been isolated from ovary fluid or from epithelial tumor tissue around the mouth of mature masu salmon. It has not been found in the other species of fish. Incidence of OMV has decreased since we suggested iodophore treatment at the <b>eyed</b> <b>egg</b> stage. CSV was isolated from the kidney of healthy chum salmon at Tokushibetsu Hatchery in 1978 but during the period from 1979 through 1986, CSV has not been found from mature fish.

40|$|The Grande Ronde Basin Spring Chinook Salmon Captive Broodstock Program is {{designed}} to rapidly increase numbers of Chinook salmon in stocks that are in imminent danger of extirpation in Catherine Creek (CC), Lostine River (LR) and upper Grande Ronde River (GR). Natural parr are captured and reared to adulthood in captivity, spawned (within stocks) and their progeny reared to smoltification before being released into the natal stream of their parents. This program is co-managed by ODFW, National Marine Fisheries Service, Nez Perce Tribe and Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Presmolt rearing was initially conducted at Lookingglass Fish Hatchery (LFH) but parr collected in 2003 and later were reared at Wallowa Fish Hatchery (WFH). Post-smolt rearing is conducted at Bonneville Fish Hatchery (BOH - freshwater) and at Manchester Research Station (MRS - saltwater). The CC and LR programs are being terminated, as these populations have achieved {{the goal of a}} consistent return of 150 naturally spawning adults, so the 2005 brood year was the last brood year collected for theses populations. The Grande Ronde River program continued with 300 fish collected each year. Currently, we are attempting to collect 150 natural parr and incorporate 150 parr collected as eggs from females with low ELISA levels from the upper Grande Ronde River Conventional Hatchery Program. This is part of a comparison of two methods of obtaining fish for a captive broodstock program: natural fish vs. those spawned in captivity. In August 2007, we collected 152 parr (BY 2006) from the upper Grande Ronde River and also have 155 Grande Ronde River parr (BY 2006) that were hatched from <b>eyed</b> <b>eggs</b> at LFH. During 2008, we were unable to collect natural parr from the upper Grande Ronde River. Therefore, we obtained 300 fish from low ELISA females from the upper Grande Ronde River Conventional Program. In October 2008 we obtained 170 <b>eyed</b> <b>eggs</b> from the upper Grande Ronde river Conventional Hatchery Program. We will attempt to collect natural parr in August 2009. This year 752 fish were removed from the captive population: 629 fish survived to gamete production and 123 fish died from various causes prior to spawning. Growth of the Captive Broodstock fish was similar to previous years. The saltwater fish have grown more slowly than those reared in freshwater. A total of 720 fish were sorted as maturing and 629 (87. 4 %) of them survived to spawn. We collected gametes from 273 females and 350 males from the 2002 - 2006 brood years in 2008, using 111 spawning matrices and collected 474, 187 green eggs (1, 737 eggs/female). All ripe males were spawned and no semen was collected for cryo-preservation. Of the 474, 187 eggs collected for the BY 2008 F 1 generation, 448, 373 (94. 6 %) survived to the eyed stage. 68, 612 (15. 3 %) were culled from females with high ELISA OD values for BKD prevention. For BY 2007, we collected a total of 477, 048 eggs from all three populations and 407, 369 (85. 4 %) reached the eyed stage, while 95, 024 <b>eyed</b> <b>eggs</b> (23. 3 %) were culled for BKD prevention. Eyed eggs were hatched at Lookingglass Fish Hatchery, producing 267, 131 fry. As parr, 153, 371 fish were coded-wire tagged (CWT). For the 2006 F 1 brood year, we collected 177, 890 eggs and 149, 073 (83. 8 %) reached the eyed stage. 83, 826 <b>eyed</b> <b>eggs</b> (56. 2 %) were culled at the eyed stage for BKD prevention. 61, 044 fry were produced (93. 6 %), 53, 688 (88 %) survived to smolt. There were 54 bacterial kidney disease (BKD) mortalities at BOH and MRS, combined in this reporting period. Overall, there were fewer BKD mortalities in 2008 due to a reduced number of fish coming into the Captive Broodstock Program and a shift away from collecting wild parr to using <b>eyed</b> <b>eggs</b> from low ELISA females from the Conventional Hatchery Program. Unknown causes of death accounted for 32 deaths at MRS and BOH, combined in 2008. We continually examine and modify the operations of the Captive Broodstock Program to make improvements wherever possible. We continue to have difficulty with prevention and treatment of BKD outbreaks and continue to use erythromycin and azithromycin to treat this disease. We are also continuing to investigate other possible treatments and prophylactic measures. To reduce the incidence of BKD in offspring of the Captive Broodstock Program, we continue to allow culling of <b>eyed</b> <b>eggs</b> from females with high BKD ELISA values (generally > 0. 800 OD units but the cull level varies annually, depending on the distribution of ELISA values, number of eggs collected, and management considerations). We are also using ultrasound to determine maturity and sex of fish early in the maturation process and are now able to determine maturity and sex of most maturing fish in early April. This allows us to transfer maturing fish from saltwater to freshwater at a more natural time, which should improve fecundity and egg quality of saltwater-reared fish...|$|R

One day after incubation, IHNV was not detected from the eggs of masu salmon and chum salmon contaminated with IHNV. Eggs just after fertilization, and <b>eyed</b> <b>eggs</b> were injected intraoviumly with IHNV by microglass needle. Infectivity of IHNV inside the eggs decreased gradually {{and could not}} be detected 1 week or 5 weeks after incubation. This reduction rate of IHNV infectivity in the fertilized egg was similar to that found in the mixture with IHNV and the homogenized egg contents. Several kinds of phospholipid, amino acid and vitamin those were components of yolk showed anti-IHNV activity. In the <b>eyed</b> <b>eggs,</b> the embryos of both masu salmon and chum salmon were infected with IHNV, and this infectivity increased rapidly and reached more than 10 ^ 6. 5 TCID 50 /fish. The cumulative mortality of both masu salmon and chum salmon were 90 %. The rate of susceptibility of hatched-out masu salmon and chum salmon fry against IHNV were different, and the cumulative mortality was more than 90 % in masu salmon and 20 to 30 % in chum salmon artificially infected with IHNV by immersion method. From above results, we concluded that the vertical transmission of IHNV is doubtful. サクラマスとシロサケの未受精卵および受精卵を供試し，人為的にIHNVで汚染した後の死卵率およびウイルス感染価の消長を観察するとともに，卵内成分のIHNV感染価に及ぼす影響についても検討し以下の結論を得た。 1) 両魚種ともに，受精時に卵あるいは精子が汚染されても死卵は見られず，ウイルスも検出されなかった。 2) 受精直後の卵内にIHNVを接種した場合，サクラマスで 3 週間以内，シロサケで 5 週間以内に全卵死亡したが，ウイルスはサクラマスで 1 週間後，シロサケで 5 週間後に検出限界以下となった。 3) シロサケの未受精卵内容物にIHNVを懸濁した場合，ウイルス感染価の漸減傾向が観察され，セファリン，グルタミン酸，フェニルアラニン，トリプトファン，ピリドキサルリン酸および葉酸にウイルス不活化効果が観察された。 4) 発眼卵内にIHNVを接種した場合，サクラマスでは 7 日以内に全個体，シロサケでは 15 日以内に 90 %が死亡し，両魚種とも一尾当り 10 ^ 6. 50 TCID 50 /g以上のウイルス感染価が得られた...|$|R

40|$|Groups of maiden or repeat {{spawning}} Atlantic salmon {{were maintained}} during vitellogenesis in austral autumn at either 14 °C or 22 °C through until April when all fish {{were transferred to}} a spawning temperature of 8 °C. There {{was no difference in}} body weight within groups for maidens and repeats, with repeats being consistently larger than maidens, no difference in condition factor among groups, but consistently higher gonad weight in repeats than maidens. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) and follicle diameter were suppressed in both maidens and repeats at 22 °C, with the effect being most marked in repeat spawners. Relative fecundity (egg kg- 1) determined from ovarian tissue samples also showed depression in repeats at 22 °C. Fish from both age classes held at 22 °C had a higher proportion of atretic follicles. Plasma levels of estradiol- 17 β (E 2) were strongly depressed in both maidens and repeats exposed to 22 °C throughout autumn but there was some evidence of recovery among maiden fish by late April. A similar effect was seen on plasma testosterone (T) levels. Plasma cortisol levels were generally low and typical of levels in unstressed fish indicating that stress did not account for the inhibitory effects observed Hepatic zona pellucida protein gene expression was significantly inhibited in both maiden and repeat spawning fish reared at 22 °C, but with some evidence of recovery after temperature reduction to 8 °C. Hepatic vitellogenin (Vtg) gene expression was also lower in both maiden and repeat spawning fish exposed to 22 °C and this was accompanied by reduced plasma Vtg levels in maidens, but not repeats at 22 °C. Maidens at 14 °C began ovulating first followed by repeats at 14 °C, then repeats at 22 °C followed by maidens at 22 °C. There was reduced fertility in maidens at 22 °C relative to both maidens and repeats at 14 °C, whereas repeats at 22 °C showed intermediate fertility between 14 °C fish and 22 °C maidens. Survival to the <b>eyed</b> <b>egg</b> stage was highest in maidens at 14 °C, significantly suppressed at 22 °C in maidens, and at intermediate levels in repeats at both temperatures. This suggests that repeat spawning Atlantic salmon may be more robust in the face of thermal insult which combined with their larger size and egg production, could make their use desirable under production situations where there was any threat of exposure to higher than normal temperature...|$|E

40|$|Maturing Atlantic salmon, {{transferred}} from brackish water two weeks prespawning, were held under four different temperature and salinity regimes through their spawning period. Values of blood glucose and haematocrit were measured every week during this period. Inorganic components (K+ and Cl-) were analysed from coelomic fluid, blood and seminal plasma. The dry {{matter of the}} eggs at spawning, were measured. The mortality of the broodfish and the <b>eyed</b> <b>eggs</b> were also recorded. Cold seawater was the most unfavourable environment to the broodfish, as they suffered high mortalities {{and high levels of}} chloride, potassium and blood glucose. These results probably reflected problems with osmoregulation. Cold brackish water appeared to be the best environment to both eggs and broodfish, although the males had problems at low temperatures. The haematocrit values were highest among males, but decreased among both males and females during the investigation period. Neither haematocrit, nor the dry matter of the eggs seemed to be affected by this short time exposure to different water qualities...|$|R
40|$|The factors {{regulating}} salmonid populations remain poorly understood, although {{contamination of}} the freshwater environment has been implicated as a causative factor. Depletion of stocks has become an increasing concern and {{it is believed that}} the early life stages are potentially the most vulnerable. Reduction in salmonid stocks has been reportedly linked to water quality and this current study has shown that freshwater pollution can affect the survival and development of salmonids. Environmental concentrations measured in this study varied greatly and high levels of sediment-bound contaminants were found, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Concentrations of waterborne contaminants were similar to levels previously measured, with some high level peaks in triazine metabolites. Field studies, as previous literature has suggested, found a higher mortality in river sites of greater sediment and nutrient loading and in sites with a greater proportion of fine sediment (< 63 μm). The River Avon was found to have a higher concentration of fine sediment and mortality of implanted eggs in this site was significantly higher than in the Rivers Wylye and Nadder. Although mortality of eggs implanted in river field sites was generally high, few morphometrics and biochemical effects were observed. Laboratory studies examined the toxicity of environmentally relevant levels of water-borne and sediment-bound contaminants on the brown trout (Salmo trutta) but found few acute effects and no specific trends were observed. The results did reveal a higher frequency of yolk sac oedemas for contaminant-exposed alevins in the laboratory trials compared to the control groups. In general survival was high for both the <b>eyed</b> <b>egg</b> and alevin stages when exposed to the water-borne contaminants. However, survival was greatly reduced when the water-borne contaminant exposures were carried out from the fertilisation stage compared to the eyed stage. Generally, sedimentbound contaminants had a greater effect on survival at the egg stage and mortalities were found to be reduced at the fry stage. Additionally, the results from the comet assays revealed that exposure to sediment-bound organochlorine pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons did induce significant acute effects in the form of DNA damage when compared to the control. Such results could indicate that certain pollutants may be problematic for the species at later stages of their development and on into adulthood. In general the findings of this research proved largely inconclusive in terms of specific impacts of contaminants on the early developmental stages of Atlantic salmon and brown trout. The results of these studies did show that the presence of common pollutants within the freshwater environment can have impacts on the survival and development of salmonids. These impacts may have serious implications throughout the lifecycle and could impact heavily on recruitment and survival at both the juvenile and adult life stages, potentially leading to a reduction of wild populations.

40|$|Since 1966 {{especially}} recent decade, Caspian trout (Salmo trutta caspius Kessler, 1877) {{considered as}} a strategic endemic species for Caspian Sea fisheries resources also coldwater aquaculture in Iran. Nowadays habitat condition effects on this subspecies during life stages, artificial breeding and incubation period noticed by research and execution sessions of fisheries in Iran. Incubation duration of Caspian trout from artificial fertilization followed by green egg and <b>eyed</b> <b>egg,</b> hatching and yolk sac absorption identified as most sensitive stages for fish and any pollution, stress and deviation by natural life conditions of embryo up to larvae could provide possible mortalities and observable or hidden alterations. Among all vital factors for Caspian trout welfare even in conservation plans and stocks rehabilitation programs or recent attempts for domestication of this fish for introduction to cold water aquaculture industry, water temperature {{as the most important}} physical factor which might conserve or induce stress to rearing environment condition is not considered yet. In hatcheries activities, the temperature for incubation and rearing Caspian trout eggs is determining by available water temperature and wide range of temperatures in governmental or private farms is using depend on the water resources availability. Also global climate change consideration and increase temperature trend accompany with group of physical and chemical factors provided by fish farm discharges and other source points entered to the migration pathway of Caspian trout in spawning season were not investigated before. Natural spawning migration pathway is upstream of Caspian tout south and south west rivers especially in Cheshmehkileh upstream in Tonekabon, Iran directed this research focus on the mentioned location. For simulation of natural spawning bed for Caspian trout, water supplied from the upstream of Daryasar branch as headwater of Cheshmehkileh River which provided REDD water condition for in vitro incubation. Green eggs treatments of wild and F 1 cultured brooders both 3 + were incubated. Incubation implemented in dark, constant temperature (4, 8, 12 degree centigrade) and DO–pH–temperature digital monitoring in 3 recycling incubators ended to yolk sac absorption and entering larval stage. Hatching success, possible genome alterations by HSP 70 gene expression and comet assay implemented as diagnostic tools in 3 life stages of eyed egg– Alevin and Larvae. Numbers and diameters of larvae white fiber muscles measured by histology experiment and Hematoxylin–eosine staining. Results stated significant effect of incubation temperature on hatching success, genome and white fiber muscles of wild and F 1 samples. Hatching success measured as 31 % and 38 % for cultured and wild cold treatments, 79 % and 91 % for normal and 64 % and 73 % for warm cultured and wild treatments respectively.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the adverse effects of sexual {{maturation}} on growth and survival of rainbow trout, production possibility of all-female triploid was investigated by means of early heat shock on eggs fertilized by masculinized male’s sperm. Fish ploidy level was determined by erythrocyte size measurement and confirmed by gill nucleolus (NORs) counting as well as chromosome number. Sexual ratios and gonad development were determined by histological studies. Final results showed that progenies produced by mating sex-reversed (masculinized) males and normal females were totally female (100 %). Also, applying early heat shocks (26. 5 ° C lasting 20 min, 20 min after egg fertilization) induced about 80 % triploidy in fishes. All-female triploid, all-female diploid and mixed-sex diploid fishes did not show any significant difference in incubation stages (eyed-stage egg rate, hatching, survival from hatching to active feeding), (P> 0. 05). Eyed-stage eggs rate, and hatching rate of <b>eyed</b> <b>eggs</b> in mixed-sex triploids were significantly lower than in other treatments (...|$|R

Eggs and sperms were obtained from the mature adults collected in the Nagara River. Following the artifical insemination, one hundred million fertilized eggs were planned to be cultured up to the <b>eyed</b> <b>eggs</b> and transferred to the incubation channels. Theur survivals were to be monitored until their release. Hatching rates under the natural and experimental conditions were both suggested to be around 0. 5, and those adjusted by the survival curves were thought to be 0. 6. Instead of the one hundred million fertilized eggs to be collected, 33 million eggs were obtained as results of delayed spawning due to the limited experimental period caused by the increased water flow in the river. The overall average of the hatching rates was around 0. 5, and it is suggested that some 16. 5 million Ayu-fries have hatched out from about 33 million artificially fertilized eggs.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to maintain the viability of chilled rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) <b>eyed</b> <b>eggs</b> during storage using oxygenated perfluorochemical (PFC). Three trials were conducted using eggs at 161, 180 or 217 degree days (days from fertilization x incubation temperature in degrees C). A separate trial was conducted for 147 degree day eggs that were not at the eyed stage. For each trial, eggs were stored in a moisture-saturated atmosphere at 1 degrees C in PFC, water, and 1 : 1 combinations of PFC and PBS, PFC and 0. 3 M glucose, PFC and mineral oil, or PFC and water. The PFC was oxygenated before each trial and all media were oxygenated at weekly intervals during the storage period. Eggs from each trial were also incubated without storage to provide Day 0 results. After 3 and 5 weeks of storage, eggs from each medium were incubated at 10 degrees C until hatch. Hatching percentage was expressed as a percentage of Day 0 results. The percentage of normal alevins that hatched was also determined. There were interactions (P < 0. 01) between stage of development and treatment for hatching percentage after 3 and 5 weeks of storage. After 3 weeks of storage, eggs stored at 161, 180, or 217 degree days without PFC had hatching rates of 0 - 14. 3 % but eggs stored in any medium with PFC had hatching percentages from 75. 1 to 106. 4 % of Day 0 values. After 5 weeks of storage, eggs stored at 161 degree days in PFC plus PBS or PFC plus water, and eggs stored at 217 degree days in PFC or PFC plus water, had higher (P < 0. 05) hatching percentages than eggs stored in any of the other media. Eggs stored at 161 degree days for 5 weeks in PFC and water had a higher (P < 0. 05) percentage of normal alevins hatching than eggs stored in PFC and PBS. Because of their early developmental stage, eggs stored at 147 degree days had low hatching percentages, except eggs stored for 3 weeks in PFC or PFC plus PBS.

50|$|Big-eyed bugs {{are true}} bugs {{in the order}} Hemiptera. The two most common species are Geocoris pallens and Geocoris punctipes. Both are predators and occur in many habitats, {{including}} fields, gardens, and turf grass. Big-eyed bugs are considered an important predator in many agricultural systems and feed on mites, insect eggs, and small insects such as pink bollworm, cabbage loopers, and whiteflies. Adult big-eyed bugs are small (about 3 mm) black, gray, or tan with proportionately large <b>eyes.</b> <b>Eggs</b> are deposited singly or in clusters on leaves near potential prey. They develop with incomplete metamorphosis (there is no pupa) and take approximately 30 days to develop from egg to adult depending on temperature. Both nymphs and adults are predatory, but can survive on nectar and honeydew when prey are scarce. Big-eyed bugs, like other true bugs, have piercing-sucking mouthparts and feed by stabbing their prey and sucking or lapping the juices. Although their effectiveness as predators is not well understood, {{studies have shown that}} nymphs can eat as many as 1600 spider mites before reaching adulthood, while adults have been reported consuming as many as 80 mites per day.|$|R
