25|$|In the {{original}} Doctor Who series, the Master's TARDISes have had fully functioning chameleon circuits, having appeared as various things, including a <b>horsebox,</b> a spaceship, a fir tree, a computer bank, a grandfather clock, a fluted architectural column, an iron maiden, a fireplace, a British Airways jet, a cottage and a triangular column. Of the Master's TARDISes seen in The Keeper of Traken, one appears as the calcified, statue-like Melkur, {{able to move}} and even walk; the other appears as a grandfather clock. The Melkur TARDIS is destroyed. At one point in Logopolis, the Master's TARDIS even appears as a police box, like the Doctor's.|$|E
2500|$|Fred Quilley (Felix Bowness) Riding Instructor – Fred was {{an illegitimate}} child {{and grew up}} in an orphanage until he was adopted at the age of {{fourteen}} and went to live in Brighton. He began working at the Brighton Racecourse and eventually qualified as a jockey. He became involved with the daughter of the local undertaker but they split up when he refused to join the family business. During World War II he was conscripted into the RAF, where he trained as an instrument mechanic, but spent the entire war stationed at Catterick. After being demobilised in 1945, he returned to Brighton Racecourse and married the owner of a wet-fish shop, but the relationship was short-lived and they soon separated. He then fell into the employ of a small-time gangster known as [...] "Big Mac", who began paying him to fix the races, either by pulling his horse or drugging it prior to the race. However, on one occasion the race officials caught him pulling the favourite and gave him an official warning. The following week he took £300 from Big Mac to lose a race but accidentally won, causing Big Mac to lose £5,000 in bets. Shortly afterwards Fred was caught in a <b>horsebox</b> with a syringe and his jockey's licence was revoked. He was forced to leave Brighton for fear of further reprisals from the underworld and began drifting, eventually joining the staff at Maplins in 1951 as the riding instructor. Fred shared a chalet with Mr Partridge, even though they both hated each other – Fred hated Partridge smelling of alcohol and Partridge hated Fred smelling of horses. When Partridge left and faked his death, Fred shared a chalet with Sammy, although they had a better relationship. After the end of the 1960 season, Fred went to work in an old horses' home.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Horseboxes</b> (motorised) {{can vary}} in size, {{depending}} on the number and size of horses to be carried. In Europe, <b>horseboxes</b> are developed from vehicles ranging from 3.5 tonne gross vehicle weight, through to legal maximums of over 40 tonnes.|$|R

60|$|It {{was a case}} of {{a partial}} {{restoration}} of a church in the dawn of such doings, when the <b>horsebox</b> was removed, but the great family could not be routed out of the chancel, so there were the seats, where the choir ought to have sat, beneath a very ugly east window, bedecked with the Morton arms. In the other division of the seat was a pale lady in black, with a little girl, Lady Adela Morton, no doubt, and opposite were the servants, and the school children sat crowded on the steps. It was not such a service as had been the custom of the Hurminster churches; and the singing, such as it was, depended on the thin shrill voices of the children, assisted by Lady Adela and the mistress; the sermon was dull and long, and altogether there was something disheartening about the whole.|$|E

5000|$|In 1882, it was {{the scene}} of a serious accident. A special train had been {{provided}} for the Meynell Hunt. It left Derby Friargate with four <b>horseboxes</b> from GNR and the MS&LR plus three passenger carriages. At Sudbury six North Staffordshire <b>horseboxes</b> were added after the first coach, which was behind the engine. Thus only one vehicle was continuously braked. Although the driver was using care in approaching stations, he was being piloted by the fireman who knew the line, but not that the passing loop at Chartley had just been brought into use. The train approached Chartley at 30 to 35 miles an hour and the leading coach became derailed. This caused the <b>horseboxes</b> to strike the timber platform, causing severe damage, and several horses were killed or injured. Luckily none of the passengers or crew were hurt. The Inspecting Officer for the Board of Trade recommended that, in future, the facing points for all passing loops should be straight, with the [...] "S" [...] curve at the trailing end.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{severity}} of his wounds, Sefton was led in to the first <b>horsebox</b> to arrive on scene, where he was driven to the barracks along with Major Carding, Farrier-Major Brian Smith and three other troopers holding Sefton. Carding ordered the <b>horsebox</b> to the forge, rather than the stables, due to its proximity. Here, Carding began 90 minutes of emergency operation to save Sefton's life - {{the first of the}} British Army's veterinary officers to operate on war-like wounds to a cavalry horse in {{more than half a century}} - whilst also directing care of the other wounded horses prior to the arrival of civilian vets to assist.|$|E

50|$|A horse trailer or horse van (also {{called a}} horse float in Australia and New Zealand or <b>horsebox</b> in the British Isles) {{is used to}} {{transport}} horses. There are many different designs, {{ranging in size from}} small units capable of holding two or three horses, able to be pulled by a pickup truck or even a SUV; to gooseneck designs that carry six to eight horses, usually pulled by 1-ton dually-style pickups. There are also large semi-trailers that can haul a significant number of animals. In the UK, a <b>horsebox</b> may also refer to a motorised vehicle adapted to carry horses (generally known as a horse van in North America or Australasia), or a railway vehicle specifically designed to carry horses.|$|E
50|$|As {{it entered}} the curve at Bullhouse, the driver felt the engine develop an uneasy roll, {{but before he}} could apply the brakes, he heard a crack. A driving wheel axle on the {{locomotive}} had snapped, and the resulting spread of the driving wheels distorted the track. The axle fracture was probably caused by metal fatigue. A Cheshire Lines Committee <b>horsebox</b> coupled behind the engine was derailed but remained upright. The coupling between the <b>horsebox</b> and the following carriages failed, and the first five GNR carriages (the London portion of the train) ran off the rails and down the embankment {{on the outside of the}} curve. The last five MS&L carriages (the Grimsby portion) were also derailed but suffered less damage.|$|E

5000|$|Their {{immediate}} {{investigation was}} hampered by {{a piece of}} planning by the gang, which had selected {{the same day as}} the biggest horse sales in the country, when <b>horseboxes</b> had passed along every road in Ireland. Leading the investigation into the theft was trilby-wearing Chief Superintendent Jim [...] "Spud" [...] Murphy, who was the subject of much media coverage. His detection techniques were unconventional, and a variety of clairvoyants, psychics and diviners were called in to help. During one interview, Mr Murphy told reporters: [...] "A clue... that is what we haven't got." ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{beginning}} three passenger trains ran {{in each direction}} Mondays to Saturdays, calling at all stations, with two on Sundays. By {{the end of the}} 19th century the Sunday service had ceased, but the line reached its high water mark with four trains each way each weekday. Thereafter the line ran a notably consistent three trains in each direction calling at all stations, Mondays to Saturdays, until the service was withdrawn in 1953. Some of the services had two coaches, others one, though it was far from rare to add one or more <b>horseboxes</b> in what was and remains racing country. Loadings were good on Saturdays (Market Days) but schoolchildren were the mainstay during the week.|$|R

50|$|In Europe, most {{motorised}} horseboxes {{will feature}} a single main ramp on the rear or to the side, though those with rear ramps may have a second smaller side ramp. Within the European Union, regulations dictate that a <b>horsebox</b> ramp (used for commercial transportation of horses) should be no steeper than 20°. It is also a requirement that the driver or other attendant {{be able to access}} the horse area without using the ramp. This is often achieved through fitting a small hatch or doorway (called a groom's door in the UK).|$|E
5000|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} conceived {{as part of}} a trunk route between Kingston-upon-Hull and the North East of England, but this came to very little. The station remained throughout its life a country station on a country byway. In some periods of its life four passenger trains a day ran in each direction between [...] and , calling at all stations between, {{but for the most part}} just three called, with no Sunday service after the outbreak of the First World War. These trains were nicknamed the [...] "Malton Dodger". They usually had either one or two coaches, often strengthened by one or more <b>horseboxes</b> in this racing country. An intermittent excursion traffic before the Second World War called at Wharram to view the station's floral displays and well as the area's scenery.|$|R
5000|$|Goods {{traffic was}} at a peak during the interwar period, when the sidings saw a variety of {{interesting}} traffic. <b>Horseboxes</b> and cattle wagons were numerous, and during the war, it was a stabling point for an emergency tank train. A large banana ripening shed was opened in the late 1950s and this received supplies direct from Avonmouth Docks. This closed on 1 October 1971 as bananas were now containerised and transported by road. Race traffic has also decreased and the track layout was progressively simplified, leaving the remaining traffic {{to be dealt with}} by strengthening ordinary services. Further modifications were carried out in 1972 when the station was [...] "modernised" [...] by demolishing the goods shed and removing the down platform canopy. However, the main buildings, together with the adjoining stationmaster's house, have survived as good examples of an LBSCR country station.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{thousands}} of people still live a traveller lifestyle in Britain. [...] they are normally known simply as Travellers. Few, if any, travellers live on the local authority sites reserved for Romani/Gypsy, Scottish Gypsies/Travellers and Irish Travellers, so instead stay on unauthorised sites throughout the countryside, particularly in Wales and the south-west of England, and in urban areas. London hosts {{a large number of}} traveller sites in places such as disused factory or warehouse yards, and there is often a crossover between travellers and squatters, with travellers parking up in yards attached to squatted buildings. Typical traveller sites might have anywhere from 5 to 30 vehicles on them, including trailers and caravans as well as buses, vans, and <b>horseboxes</b> converted to live in. Although most Travellers in Britain are British, large numbers of Continental Europeans also [...] "travel" [...] in the UK.|$|R
