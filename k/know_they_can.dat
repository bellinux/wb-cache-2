2500|$|The Miranda warning (often {{shortened}} to [...] "Miranda", or [...] "Mirandizing" [...] a suspect) is {{the name}} of the formal warning that is required to be given by police in the United States to criminal suspects in police custody (or in a custodial situation) before they are interrogated, in accordance with the Miranda ruling. Its purpose is to ensure the accused are aware of, and reminded of, these rights under the U.S. Constitution, and that they <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> invoke them at any time during the interview. The circumstances triggering the Miranda safeguards, i.e., Miranda rights, are [...] "custody" [...] and [...] "interrogation". Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest. Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.|$|E
2500|$|The album has a {{score of}} 66 out of 100 from Metacritic, {{indicating}} [...] "generally favorable reviews". The New York Times gave the album a favorable review and said, [...] "The panache of the singing and the radiant complexity of the music--an achievement shared by Mr. Rodriguez Lopez {{and a handful of}} regular collaborators, including the Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante--drive the album relentlessly forward. And it’s the subtle touches, no less than the sweeping ones, that leave an impression." [...] The Boston Globe also gave it a favorable review and said, [...] "Guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala are the creative duo driving the band and once again deliver on a standing promise to blow any mind that is willing to stay open." [...] Planet Sound gave it {{a score of}} seven out of ten and called it the band's [...] "most chilled-out and approachable record." [...] NME also gave it a score of seven out of ten and said it [...] "might be their ‘reflective’ effort, but it’s classic MV." [...] Under the Radar gave it seven stars out of ten and said, [...] "We already knew The Mars Volta could shred. Now we <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> slow the pace too and be equally as compelling." [...] Tiny Mix Tapes gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said it [...] "isn’t a representation of the best The Mars Volta are capable of, but it is a glimpse into the power they possess when they better harness their capabilities." [...] musicOMH also gave it a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and said {{that for the first time}} the band [...] "really can do restraint, without compromising the overall impact of the instances where things are let rip." [...] Paste gave the album altogether a review averaging about 6.5 out of ten: Rachel Dovey gave it an eight out of ten and said that [...] "the group returns to dark balladry on 'Desperate Graves' and 'Copernicus,' two more highlights from a haunting album full of twilight poetry"; Corey DuBrowa, however, gave it five out of ten and called the album [...] "the sound of a band treading water." ...|$|E
