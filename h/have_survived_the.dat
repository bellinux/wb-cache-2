5|$|Aristotle's {{writings}} on biology, {{the first in}} the history of science, are scattered across several books, forming about a quarter of his writings that <b>have</b> <b>survived.</b> <b>The</b> main biology texts were the History of Animals, Generation of Animals, Movement of Animals, Progression of Animals, Parts of Animals, and On the Soul, as well as the lost drawings of The Anatomies which accompanied the History.|$|E

5|$|Jonathan Phillips as Second Officer Charles Lightoller. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith {{that it will}} be {{difficult}} to see icebergs without breaking water. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to <b>have</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> disaster.|$|E
5|$|The Aurora {{returned}} to Cape Denison the following summer, in mid-December, {{to take the}} men home.

5|$|De León later rescued L'Archeveque and his {{companion}} Jacques Grollet. On interrogation, the men maintained that over 100 of the French settlers {{had died of}} smallpox, and the others {{had been killed by}} Native Americans. The only people known to <b>have</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> final attack were the Talon children, who had been adopted by the Karankawa. According to the children, the settlement had been attacked around Christmas of 1688, and all the remaining settlers had been killed.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{career is}} not well {{documented}} in the surviving sources. Charters provide a little information about some of his activities, but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west <b>have</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E

5|$|From {{the classic}} {{language}} {{to the present}} day, a body of literature has been written in Mayan languages. The earliest texts to have been preserved are largely monumental inscriptions documenting rulership, succession, and ascension, conquest and calendrical and astronomical events. It is likely that other kinds of literature were written in perishable media such as codices made of bark, only four of which <b>have</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> ravages {{of time and the}} campaign of destruction by Spanish missionaries.|$|E
5|$|Her {{murder by}} {{communist}} revolutionaries on 17 July 1918 resulted in her being named as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church. She was a younger sister of Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia and an elder sister of Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia and Tsarevich Alexei of Russia. All sisters were falsely rumored to <b>have</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> assassination {{and dozens of}} imposters claimed to be surviving Romanovs. Author Michael Occleshaw speculated that a woman named Larissa Tudor might have been Tatiana; however, all of the Romanovs, including Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia, {{were killed by the}} Bolshevik.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{available}} information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to <b>have</b> <b>survived.</b> <b>The</b> other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida abbandonata—were abandoned by Monteverdi before completion; how much of their music was actually written is unknown.|$|E

5|$|The Wujing Zongyao {{was one of}} 347 {{military}} treatises {{listed in}} the biographical chapters of the History of Song (1345 AD), one of the Twenty-Four Histories.

5|$|The {{operation}} officially {{began when}} a lone Israeli S-199 bombed Egyptian positions in Isdud at 18:00 on June 2. Five light planes—two Fairchild 24s, two Rapides and one Bonanza—also made bombing runs between 20:25 and 21:30. The bombardment {{did not make}} an impression on the readying Israeli soldiers, and {{in light of the}} noise created by the Egyptian anti-aircraft guns, the Israelis considered that the plane was lucky to <b>have</b> <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> run. In addition, the troops were exhausted, not having had proper sleep in the four days preceding the operation. At 22:00, the Israeli forces started moving against the Egyptian positions.|$|E
