5|$|To {{mark the}} 40th anniversary of Naim Audio and the 30th {{birthday}} {{of the original}} NAIT, Naim unveiled a new 3-product range under the NAIT brand: the NAIT 5si, NAIT XS 2 and SUPERNAIT 2. The range has seen a general uprating of the transformer compared with the versions they replaced, allowing for better power delivery. The manufacturer claims use of better components in critical areas and new circuitry. All three models have built-in headphone amplifiers. The <b>digital–analogue</b> <b>converter</b> has been removed as being available either as a separate unit, {{or as part of}} the Uniti.|$|E
500|$|In {{launching}} the 2013 NAIT range, Steve Sells, electronic design manager of Naim, explained {{how the new}} NAITs fulfilled the goal of delivering sound quality performance. They are stripped of superfluous components and features, and as such, the <b>digital–analogue</b> <b>converter</b> (DAC) previously available on the [...] has not {{found its way into}} its successor. The transformer is deliberately positioned as far away as possible from the inputs to avoid electromagnetic interference, while the power supply and its capacitors are closer to both the transformer and the output devices. Non-audio circuitry for controlling the amplifiers are optically isolated from signal sections, and are designed to power down when not in use, to avoid interference.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} <b>digital-analogue</b> <b>converter</b> {{quantization}} effects and the minimum resolution required in an OFDMA-PON {{is carried out}} with 10 Gbps transceivers. The PON is based on DD over a maximum of 100 km fibre length. Results indicate that a 6 -bit resolution for both, DAC and ADC are enough for ensuring a FEC limit BER of 10 - 3 for a penalty of 1 dB compared with infinite quantization for downstream with 16 QAM modulation. For upstream signals with QPSK modulation, a 6 -bit DAC with 6 -bit ADC ensures almost no penalty, while a 4 -bit DAC gives a penalty of 2 dB related with infinite quantization.
