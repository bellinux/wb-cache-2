Interventions were identified from systematic searches of the published literature and a web-based search (Google and implementer’s websites). Studies were eligible if an intervention addressed gender dynamics (i. e., norms, unequal access to resources), measured relevant behavioral outcomes (e. g., family planning, antenatal care, nutrition), used at least a moderate evaluation design, and were implemented in low- or middle-income countries. Of the 23 interventions identified, 22 addressed reproductive and maternal-child health behaviors (e. g., birth spacing, antenatal care, breastfeeding) that improve child health. Eight interventions were accommodating (i. e., acknowledged, but did not seek to change gender dynamics), and 15 were transformative (i. e., sought to change gender dynamics). The majority of evaluations (n 12), including interventions that engaged {{men and women to}} modify gender norms, had mixed effects.

Student involvement in the design of the university library services is needed as they have distinct patterns of technology use: variety of platforms, nearly always including smart-phones and laptops, variety of social networks and often, a range of other digital tools. The involvement can take place in many different ways, <b>e.</b> g., <b>participatory</b> design projects, involvement through social media and others. In this paper, we describe our approach to innovation through student engagement in design of library services: innovation through an interaction design course and exposure to design thinking. Over a period of three years, our findings show that student projects have become increasingly original and creative. In addition, the level of engagement to produce finished products and services after taking the course has increased. Keywords- innovation; user-driven; design; service design; design thinking.

40|$|While courageous, {{collaborative}} {{leadership has}} not been formally recognized as a “model” by those who study educational leadership, there is {{a wealth of information}} about collaborative (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>participatory)</b> leadership and a growing corpus of literature focused on courageous leadership. As {{in the development of the}} ideas connected to collaborative leadership, the world of business is taking the lead in delineating what courageous leadership means. Some of this literature has even surfaced in the realm of religious studies (Hybels, 2002). Simply defined, courageousness in leadership addresses the necessity to step outside the box and take chances to help the organization establish appropriate and defensible goals. It also clearly places those who are leaders in a position to confront adversity. Collaborative leadership refers to inclusiveness— teachers, staff, administrators, parents, and other stakeholders—in decision making related to organizational goals. Research in both of the areas of courageousness and collaboration should advance a fuller understanding of what courageous, collaborative leadership is. Since courageous, collaborative leadership is by its very nature effective leadership, this research summary will also briefly review the literature regarding effective leadership...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} article {{offers a}} brief overview of current nanotechnology policy, regulation and ethics in Europe and The People’s Republic of China with the intent of noting (dis) similarities in approach, before focusing on the involvement of the public in science and technology policy (i. <b>e.</b> <b>participatory</b> Technology Assessment). The conclusions of this article are, that (a) in terms of nanosafety as expressed through policy and regulation, China PR and the EU have similar approaches towards, and concerns about, nanotoxicity—the official debate on benefits and risks is not markedly different in the two regions; (b) that there is a similar economic drive behind both regions’ approach to nanodevelopment, the difference being the degree of public concern admitted; and (c) participation in decision-making is fundamentally different in the two regions. Thus in China PR, {{the focus is on the}} responsibility of the scientist; in the EU, it is about government accountability to the public. The formulation of a Code of Conduct for scientists in both regions (China PR’s predicted for 2012) reveals both similarity and difference in approach to nanotechnology development.

40|$|Participatory Crop Improvement (PCI) has {{developed}} {{over the past decade}} as an alternative and complementary breeding approach to Formal Crop Improvement (FCI). In that context, PCI principally aims at more effectively addressing the needs of farmers in marginal areas in developing countries. This paper describes the rationale behind the emerging of the PCI-concept, the first experiences, and its place in a development-context. The relation with in situ conservation of plant genetic resources is briefly described. The paper uses the distinction in PCI between PVS (Participatory Varietal Selection, i. <b>e.</b> <b>participatory</b> selection among varieties and advanced materials) and PPB (Participatory Plant Breeding, i. e. selection within segregating materials). While successful experiences of PVS are reported, the potentials of PPB are still to be explored. Among other issues, this article pays attention to Genotype x Environment interaction: while G x E interaction is recognised as an important issue in plant breeding and a justification for PCI, the implications for the design of selection systems with farmer participation, and, eventually the potential of PPB has only been analysed to a limited extend. Questions in relation to materials, breeding strategies and selection procedures to achieve sufficient progress in the different crops and environments are identified; these will however remain unanswered until more experiences from the field are available...|$|E

40|$|An Integrative Approach to Community Practice This paper {{outlines}} {{a community}} practice methodology {{developed at the}} Center for Participa-tory Change, a nonprofit organization in the Appalachian mountains of Western North Carolina.

40|$|For two reasons, our {{capacity}} for systematic comparison of innovative participatory democratic processes remains limited. First, {{the category of}} participatory democratic innovations remains relatively vague when compared to more traditional democratic institutions and practices. Second, until recently there existed no large-sample databases that captured relevant variables {{in the practice of}} democratic innovation. The lone exception to these patterns is the Participedia database, located online. Participedia is well placed to respond to the two obstacles to systematic comparative research on democratic innovation. First, its crowdsourced data collection strategy means that many of the cases on the platform are not well known and have not been the subject of sustained academic analysis. Second, the data captured in the articles provides the basis for systematic comparative analysis of democratic innovations both within type (<b>e.</b> g., <b>participatory</b> budgeting, mini-publics) and across types.

40|$|Students with {{different}} learning styles approach learning differently. With {{the rise of}} social media technologies, investigating {{the effect of these}} styles on their intentions to use social media for learning has become all the more important. This study explored the factors affecting students' intentions to use social media for learning based on their learning styles (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>participatory,</b> collaborative, and independent), using the social media acceptance model. By convenience sampling, 300 Malaysian students were recruited via an online survey (Nparticipatory = 116; Nindependent = 97; and Ncollaborative = 87). The survey was prepared by drawing on the social media acceptance model. It was piloted before the final data collection step was conducted in August 2013. The demographic details of the students were analyzed using Statistical Program for Social Sciences 21, while path modeling and multivariate analyses were conducted using SmartPLS 2. 0. The results revealed the significant effect of Self and Performance on students' intentions to use social media regardless of their learning styles. A pair-wise comparison revealed that Self was more significant in participatory students than in collaborative students. Effort was found to be the least significant factor, indicating the popularity of social media among students. Further insight into the different factors that drive students {{with different}} learning styles to use social media will help educators use this technology to assist learning more effectively...|$|E
40|$|Population {{health as}} an {{approach}} to planning is key to improving {{the health and well-being}} of whole populations and to reduce inequities within and between population groups. The Victorian Department of Health North and West Metropolitan Region, in collaboration with The University of Melbourne (School of Population Health), have delivered four annual population health short courses. The short courses were designed to equip participants with knowledge and skills to implement population health approaches upon their return to their workplaces. For three consecutive years, online surveys (n= 41) and semi-structured interviews (n= 35), underpinned by participatory and realist evaluation approaches, were conducted to obtain the perceptions and experiences of the population health short course participants. Evaluation findings indicate that participants' understanding of population health concepts increased; however, there were mixed outcomes in assisting participants' implementation of population health approaches upon their return to their workplaces. A core list of perceived requirements, enablers and barriers emerged at an individual, organisational and system level as influencing the capability of participants to implement population health approaches. Evaluation recommendations and actions taken to revise short course iterations are presented, providing evidence that the evaluation approaches were appropriate and increased the use of evaluation learnings. Implications of evaluation findings for professional development practice (i. e. shift from a 'Course' as a one-off event to a Population Health 'Program' of inter-dependent components) and evaluation (i. <b>e.</b> <b>participatory</b> realist evaluation approaches) are presented.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the socio-political dynamics in the evolution and development of Flemish technology assessment (TA). Broadly defined, TA encompasses activities and programs that expand and deepen the knowledge base of contemporary knowledge-based economies (KBEs), typically by including new actors (e. g. trade unions), ideas (e. g. science in society), and rationales (<b>e.</b> g. <b>participatory</b> techniques) in science, technology, and innovation (STI) processes. Starting from the regionalization of STI policy in Belgium and the convergence of Flemish STI around global KBE principles, the article exemplifies how since the 1980 s successive Flemish TA waves (early-warning, bottom-up, and interactive TA) have co-evolved with successive generations of Flemish innovation policy. Building on these findings, it argues that Flemish TA has counteracted and accommodated dominant STI paradigms. By providing a historical and socio-political perspective on TA and innovation policy, the article draws critical attention to the institutional settings and societal contexts in which TA is embedded, and questions TA's strategic utility within contemporary KBEs. This perspective sheds light on the Flemish government's recent decision to close its parliamentary TA institute and the institutional expansion of TA elsewhere in Europe. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies a {{mechanism}} to incentivize agents who predict their own future actions and truthfully declare their predictions. In a crowdsouring setting (<b>e.</b> g., <b>participatory</b> sensing), obtaining an accurate prediction {{of the actions of}} workers/agents is valuable for a requester who is collecting real-world information from the crowd. If an agent predicts an external event that she cannot control herself (e. g., tomor-row’s weather), any proper scoring rule can give an accurate incentive. In our problem setting, an agent needs to predict her own action (e. g., what time tomorrow she will take a photo of a specific place) that she can control to maximize her utility. Also, her (gross) utility can vary based on an eter-nal event. We first prove that {{a mechanism}} can satisfy our goal if and only if it utilizes a strictly proper scoring rule, assuming that an agent can find an optimal declaration that maximizes her expected utility. This declaration is self-fulfilling; if she acts to maximize her utility, the probabilistic distribution of her action matches her declaration, assuming her prediction about the external event is correct. Furthermore, we develop a heuristic algorithm that efficiently finds a semi-optimal dec-laration, and show that this declaration is still self-fulfilling. We also examine our heuristic algorithm’s performance and describe how an agent acts when she faces an unexpected sce-nario...|$|R

40|$|East Kalimantan {{has become}} {{increasingly}} vulnerable to forest fires {{in the last two}} decades. Most of the burning is caused by human activities aggravated by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The forest fires have seriously affected the livelihoods of people relying on the forests and many households are now less secure after the 1997 / 98 forest fires. In response, CARE has developed a humanitarian approach to community forest fire management based on disaster management concepts. Disaster management incorporates community development with disaster/emergency responses. CARE’s programme consists of six clusters of activities, i. <b>e.</b> <b>participatory</b> action and learning, training in disaster management, building local emergency response capacity, improving land-use mapping, organizing stakeholder planning workshops and establishing stakeholder forums on disaster management at the sub-district level. Initial assessments highlighted the communities ’ fatalistic attitudes about their situation. CARE’s attempts to engage the communities in designing and implementing activities have proven to be a successful start of the project. Training in disaster management was effective in developing initial links between communities and other stakeholders, as well as establishing a common vision about disaster management. Disaster management has great potential in dealing with increased vulnerability to forest fires. One of its strong points is the flexibility of the programme that allows communities to adapt activities to suit their socio-cultural traditions and needs, and to integrate them into village development plans. It is equally important to expose stakeholders to existing international standards of entitlements to emergency assistance. 1...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{research}} to help understand how human development programs at a university can help students improve {{their understanding of the}} international communities. The programs are based around the concept of ESD (Education for Sustainable Development). The authors have been trying to refine classes based on Model United Nations (MUN) for two years since 2005. What we have learned is {{that it is necessary to}} explain to students how different programs are interrelated to each others. In the efforts to do so，we examined how the classes should be conducted，how to improve the coordination between classes，and what textbooks may be used. ESD proposes to realize sustainable development，and in order to achieve it，various kinds of participatory education methods are proposed with approaches from many different academic fields. Those proposals can be valuable for many different academic fields，for university departments，and for this current research. We experimented with a few activities，i. <b>e.</b> <b>participatory</b> education methods，in our classes. We also tried to coordinate and combine those methods and Model United Nations. Finally，we produced a curriculum map and examined to create textbooks.

Hackathon in general is an event at which problems are solved in a limited time frame with intense participant collaboration. The focus of a hackathon is usually predefined; however creativity in problem solving is at the forefront of all activities. The paper will describe the specifics of urban hackathon, a derivative form of civic hackathon, which uses similar approach, harnessing the potential of information technologies and stakeholders involvement in the field of urban development and urban renewal. Despite vast amount of information and unprecedented potentials of existing technologies, they are not being used to full potential in the practise of urban development. At the same time, the importance of horizontal integration between different professions, inclusion of stakeholders, communities and researchers is increasingly becoming the central theme in managing the contemporary urban environment.

The aim of this project is to research engagement strategies (i. <b>e.</b> the <b>participatory</b> tools and approaches used by NRM institutions and practitioners) {{in partnership with the}} SEQWC regional body, in order to improve engagement practice in the region. The research approach consists of: (i) understanding current NRM engagement practices; (ii) motivations and preferences for NRM engagement; and (iii) trialing tools for NRM engagement. Data were collected from key informant interviews and participant observation of current engagement practice. Key preliminary findings include: (i) engagement practitioners often perform multiple roles that may be in conflict; (ii) most engagement practitioners have little formal training in engagement and (iii) the majority of tools used are engager-driven, reactionary and largely involve the usual suspects. Three key learnings: (1) engagement could be improved by training for practitioners to enhance their current engagement practice e. g. the inclusion of a monitoring and evaluation component of engagement activities invites greater practitioner reflection and capacity-building; (2) there is the opportunity to transfer knowledge amongst practitioners and the potential for greater coordination of engagement activities; and (3) the research is relevant to many NRM regions where peri-urban development is rapidly changing the landscape so there is an opportunity to extend and develop these findings to improve engagement in these transitional regions...|$|R

Prior to induction to their jobs, the district education officers, principals of elementary colleges of education and higher secondary schools are not formally exposed to any new educational management and leadership practices. As a result, most of them remain unaware of the tasks and demands of their role, therefore, they tend to maintain a status quo position rather than engaging in change strategies for improving the quality of education in their organization. In order to improve their professional knowledge, skills and competence, The Aga Khan University, Institute for Educational Development organized a ten week professional development programme embedded in the paradigm of critical inquiry. The participants were encouraged to critically reflect on their existing beliefs, notions of educational management practices and explore alternatives for improvement. Lewin 2 ̆ 7 s model of professional learning (i. e. unfreezing, moving and refreezing) was employed as a vehicle for the professional learning of the participants.

40|$|To {{assess the}} extent to which the {{organizational}} culture of physician group practices is associated with individual physician satisfaction with the managerial and organizational capabilities of the groups. Study Design and Methods. Physician surveys from 1997 to 1998 assessing the culture of their medical groups and their satisfaction with six aspects of group practice. Organizational culture was conceptualized using the Competing Values framework, yielding four distinct cultural types. Physician-level data were aggregated to the group level to attain measures of organizational culture. Using hierarchical linear modeling, individual physician satisfaction with six dimensions of group practice was predicted using physician-level variables and group-level variables. Separate models for each of the four cultural types were estimated for each of the six satisfaction measures, yielding a total of 24 models. Sample Studied. Fifty-two medical groups affiliated with 12 integrated health systems from across the U. S., involving 1, 593 physician respondents (38. 3 percent response rate). Larger medical groups and multispecialty groups were over-represented compared with the U. S. as a whole. Principal Findings. Our models explain up to 31 percent of the variance in individual physician satisfaction with group practice, with individual organizational culture scales explaining up to 5 percent of the variance. Group-level predictors: group (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>participatory)</b> culture was positively associated with satisfaction with staff and human resources, technological sophistication, and price competition. Hierarchical (i. e., bureaucratic) culture was negatively associated with satisfaction with managerial decision making, practice level competitiveness, price competition, and financial capabilities. Rational (i. e., task-oriented) culture was negatively associated with satisfaction with staff and human resources, and price competition. Developmental (i. e., risk-taking) culture was not significantly associated with any of the satisfaction measures. In some of the models, being a single-specialty group (compared with a primary care group) and a group having a higher percent of male physicians were positively associated with satisfaction with financial capabilities. Physician-level predictors: individual physicians' ratings of organizational culture were significantly related to many of the satisfaction measures. In general, older physicians were more satisfied than younger physicians with many of the satisfaction measures. Male physicians were less satisfied with data capabilities. Primary care physicians (versus specialists) were less satisfied with price competition. Conclusion. Some dimensions of physician organizational culture are significantly associated with various aspects of individual physician satisfaction with group practice...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{food waste}} has {{attracted}} many attention world wide {{and it requires}} a concrete solution. Foodstuffs lost during the processing is known as food losse, while left over or unconsumed food is known as food waste. Waste from tofu home industry still contains protein which may lead to emission of green house gases, i. e. nitrogen gases, expected {{to contribute to the}} climate change. Service learning is an effective pedagogical method which bridges service and learning through an actual experience and reflection to internalize values. In this study, a stand alone Environmental Service Learning (ESL) was incorporated in “Technology and Waste Utilization” course at Politeknik Tonggak Equator (POLTEQ), Pontianak. The ESL was conducted at a Tofu Home Industry to estimate the Nitrogen Footprint. Aims of this research were (1) to estimate the nitrogen footprint of the home based tofu production, and (2) to ascertain to what extent ESL application can improve environmental awareness among the students participating in the course. This research employed a qualitative approach, i. <b>e.</b> <b>Participatory</b> Action Research (PAR). The principle of PAR is involvement of individuals as an important element of the study. ESL is implemented in learning about nitrogen footprint calculation in a tofu home industry. Nitrogen footprint is a measure of anthropogenic nitrogen consumption and discharge. In this study nitrogen footprint and virtual nitrogen were used to estimate nitrogen gases discharged by the tofu industry using Life Cycle Assessment approach. The nitrogen footprint and virtual nitrogen were calculated based on protein contents of the waste and product with a conversion factor of 0. 16. Total Nitrogen generated by the tofu industry are 2. 368 kg, and 71. 04 kg, 852. 48 kg, 8524. 8 kg, 85248 kg in 1 day, 1 month, 1 year, 10 years and 100 years, respectively. The results of pre-test and post-test showed that the ESL participants acquired a better knowledge on the pollution of tofu industry and its climate change implication. Improved cognitive, affective and psychomotoric competences were also found after the completion of ESL. Through the reflection session the participants are able to realize and have empathy on the challenges faced by tofu home industry owner and workers, {{as well as on the}} environmental impact of tofu production. Moreover, the ESL participants have committed to practice a more environmentally friendly food processing and consumption.

40|$|Abandonment {{or change}} of {{traditional}} (pre-modern) management systems threaten semi-natural grasslands worldwide. Understanding existing traditional grassland management could greatly help {{to improve our}} ability to preserve biodiversity in traditionally managed farmlands. We studied the management of species-rich man-made grasslands (ca. 32 - 52 vascular plant species on 16 m 2) and the related traditional ecological knowledge in Gyimes (Romania), where more than 40, 000 hectares of meadows and pastures are still managed traditionally. Methods of ecological anthropology <b>e.</b> g. <b>participatory</b> field work, semi-structured interviews (33 interviewees), and free listings were used. Csángós (people living in these valleys of the Carpathians) distinguish hay meadows based on manuring: nearby and distant hay meadows. Pastures are classified into pastures near settlements, mountain pastures, and pastures for sheep. Traditional management of meadows includes mowing, cleaning, mowing-date rotation of tracts, amelioration with hayseed and Onobrychis viciifolia seeds, manuring, manual thinning of unwanted plants, suppression of mosses, and small-scale drainage. We argue that the mowing-date rotation system found in Gyimes is a unique land-use practice that could greatly enhance biodiversity together with hayseed scattering. Treatment of pastures is more simple: sectional cleaning of shrubs/trees, and burning and corralling against Nardus. The goal of Csángós is not to protect biodiversity, but to keep their grasslands in good condition for a long run, and thus ascertain the availability of hay in the needed quantity and quality. We argue that subsidy systems should encourage the maintenance of this and similar systems, support the still existing local traditional communities and also in protected areas management systems should build on the experiences of these small-scale traditional farmers. © 2013...|$|R
40|$|Development {{institutions}} and projects frequently seek to target poorer {{segments of the}} population. Yet, existing methods for evaluating their outreach are generally unsuited to most operational settings, since they are either too costly and cumbersome (e. g., detailed income or household surveys), or they produce results that are not comparable between villages or regions within a country (<b>e.</b> g., <b>participatory</b> poverty appraisals). This paper presents a new and operationally suitable method to measure the poverty of clients of development projects {{in relation to the}} general population of nonclients. The method was developed in response to demands by donors and development practitioners for a low-cost evaluation instrument that {{could be used as a}} regular operational tool for assessing the poverty outreach of a development project or institution. While the method was originally developed for the purpose of assessing the poverty outreach of microfinance institutions (MFIs), we believe the method can be used for any development policy or project that pursues an explicit objective of reaching poorer people. The paper begins by discussing existing methods of poverty assessment. Next, the paper presents heuristic steps for identifying indicators of poverty to be tested in the case studies, including the questionnaire that was field tested in four countries with large differences in poverty-level, socioeconomic, and cultural contexts, and with MFIs that worked either in urban, rural, or mixed areas with different target clientele and financial iii products. The authors then describe the method of principal component analysis used to construct a poverty score as the measure of relative poverty. The paper concludes with a summary of results from four country case studies (two in Sub [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the space}} {{of just a few}} years the concept of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), or in Dutch Maatschappelijk verantwoord innoveren (MVI), has gained {{considerable}} ground: NWO has an MVI-program that has so far funded three rounds of research proposals; Horizon 2020 regularly refers to RRI; and there is now a new journal devoted to RRI. In this panel we focus on the following questions: • How could the concept become so popular in such a relatively short time? • What, if anything, is new in RRI, when we compare it to <b>e.</b> g. CTA, <b>participatory</b> TA, Public Engagement, etc? • If we want to make research and innovation more responsible and responsive to society’s needs, what are the opportunities and obstacles? • What are the conditions for successful mainstreaming of RRI? Panel members Frank Kupper (Athena Institute) Hub Zwart (Centre for Society and the Life Scences), Michiel van Oudheusden (author of a dissertation on Flemish RRI initiatives), and Tsjalling Swierstra (co-founder of the Journal for RI) share their thoughts with colleagues in the audience...|$|R
