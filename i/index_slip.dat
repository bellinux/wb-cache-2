40|$|A two-fluid {{model of}} Herschel–Bulkley fluid flow through tubes of small diameters and slip {{at the wall}} is studied. It is assumed that the core region {{consists}} of Herschel–Bulkley fluid and Newtonian fluid in the peripheral region. Following the analysis of Chaturani and Upadhya, the equations of motion have been linearized and analytical solution for velocity, flow flux, effective viscosity, core hematocrit and mean hematocrit has been obtained. The expressions for all these flow relevant quantities have been numerically computed by using Mathematica software {{and the effects of}} various relevant parameters on these flow variables have been studied. It is found that effective viscosity, core hematocrit and mean hematocrit of Newtonian fluid are less than those for Bingham fluid, power-law fluid and Herschel–Bulkley fluid. Effective viscosity increases with the yield stress, power-law <b>index,</b> <b>slip</b> and tube hematocrit but decreases with Darcy number. It is observed that the effective viscosity and mean hematocrit increase with tube radius but the core hematocrit decreases with tube radius.

The mean age at surgery of the <b>index</b> <b>slip</b> was 12.7  years in the bilateral cases and 13.3  years in the unilateral cases (P =  0.22). The initial slip in the bilateral cases was mild in eight hips, moderate in one hip, and severe in one hip. The subsequent contralateral slip was mild in nine hips and moderate in one. The mean slip angle (25 °) in the bilateral cases was lower than in the unilateral cases (40 °; P <  0.001). Five patients were operated on both sides within a few weeks, which was the routine at that time when there was bilateral affection {{at the time of}} diagnosis. In the remaining five patients, the subsequent contralateral slip was operated after 5, 6, 12, 13, and 21  months, respectively. No difference was found in the BMI between unilateral and bilateral SCFE (P =  0.76). The long-term results were satisfactory in both the initial and the subsequent slip, with good clinical outcome in 7 of 10 patients and good radiographic outcome results in 15 of 20 hips.|$|E

The variation process of the physical property and substance composition of the slip zone soils under the wetting-drying cycles was studied through liquid and plastic limit test and X-ray diffraction test.

40|$|Iceland {{provides}} an important opportunity to investigate relative sea-level (RSL) changes and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) glaciation in a sensitive {{area of the}} North Atlantic. This project employs new and existing RSL data, coupled with glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) modelling, to resolve the current debates surrounding {{the extent of the}} LGM Icelandic ice sheet (IIS). Robust understanding of the LGM IIS is important, because there are two markedly different maximum and minimum ice loading scenarios, with very different implications for global thermohaline circulation. Previous studies of glacial geomorphology and sedimentology have failed to differentiate between these scenarios. Reconstructing RSL changes in northwest Iceland can address this issue because the two LGM glaciation scenarios yield significantly contrasting RSL histories. Northwest Iceland is also an important location in which to determine Earth models for Iceland. In this study, a series of new sea-level <b>index</b> points (<b>SLIPs)</b> have been generated for northwest Iceland from isolation basin and coastal lowland sediment samples along two perpendicular transects. Diatom, tephrochronological and radiocarbon analyses have allowed the generation of new RSL curves for the region, showing higher marine limit elevations close to loading centres and differing influences of Younger Dryas ice re-advance. Mapping of the marine limit has shown differences in the pattern of deglaciation due to fjord width and morphology. The contrasting LGM glaciation scenarios have been tested using the GIA modelling, with the new and existing RSL dataset as a constraint. Both field data and GIA model outputs support the maximum glaciation hypothesis...|$|R

Most existing works are limited to the problems with constant slip boundaries or Newtonian fluid flow. No works have been done to the combined effect of variable hydrodynamic slip and fluid rheological behaviour on the electrokinetic flow. In the paper, the power-law electroosmotic flow in microchannels with variable boundary slip conditions is numerical simulated by the lattice Boltzmann method (Z. H. Chai, T. S. Zhao (2012)), how the Debye length, the power law <b>index,</b> the <b>slip</b> distributions on the channel boundaries affect the fluid flow involved is studied. The following conclusions can be obtained: (1) The slip contributes more to the flow flux when the power law index increases or the Debye length decreases in the variable boundaries slip cases (Fig. 1 (a)); (2) The larger boundary slip area on the boundaries means larger flow flux, the larger power law index leads to the smaller flow flux compared with the constant boundary slip cases (Fig. 1 (b)); In the meantime, the flow flux difference between cases with different boundary slip areas seems larger when the index increases; (3) the larger boundary slip oscillation frequency leads to the smaller the flow flux. The effect of the frequency is more apparent when the power law index increases. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

The flow is subject to a uniform transverse magnetic field. The suitable local similarity transformations are used to transform the non-linear partial differential equations into system of ordinary differential equations. The non-linear ordinary differential equations are linearized by using Quasi-linearization technique. The implicit finite difference scheme has been adopted to solve the obtained coupled ordinary differential equations. The important finding in this communication is the combined effects of Magnetic field parameter M, power law <b>index</b> n, <b>slip</b> parameter l, radiation parameter R, surface temperature parameter g, heat source/sink parameter S, local Eckert number Ec, temperature difference parameter r, generalized local Prandtl number Pr on velocity and temperature profiles and also the skin-friction coefficient -f''(0) and heat transfer coefficient -θ'(0) results are discussed. The results pertaining to the present study indicate that as the increase of magnetic field parameter, slip parameter decreases the velocity profiles, where as the temperature profiles increases for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. The power law index n and heat source/sink parameter decreases the dimensionless velocity and temperature profiles. The effect of radiation parameter, Eckert number leads to increase the dimensionless temperature.

Within this study, isolation basin, coastal lowland and geomorphological evidence is employed to reconstruct RSL changes in northwest (NW) Iceland, which may have experienced contrasting uplift patterns. Under local (NW) uplift, highest RSL would be expected in central Vestfirðir, whereas highest RSL would be closest to the main ice-loading centre under regional (central Iceland) uplift. In total, four new RSL records are presented based on 16 sea-level <b>index</b> points (<b>SLIPs)</b> and 4 limiting ages from sites principally focussed along a transect of locations away from central Iceland. The new RSL records highlight the spatial variability of Holocene RSL changes and provide constraints on deglacial timing. There is a clear increase in marine limit elevation with proximity to the proposed principal ice loading centre in central Iceland. Highest recorded marine limit shorelines {{are found in the}} Hrútafjörður-Heggstaðanes area (southeast), the lowest in Hlöðuvík and Rekavík bak Látrum (north), and at an intermediate elevation in Reykjanes-Laugardalur (central Vestfirðir).

In this paper, a novel control method is developed that uses only one actuator per leg and yet requires no controller tuning from the user, since the control parameters are computed through analytical expressions derived from the robot dynamics. One further actuator is used to drive a reaction wheel situated on the body. The control method leads to stable bounding gaits with controllable forward speed, and as the control is based on analytical results from the robot dynamics, it is applicable {{to a range of}} design parameters, rather than a specific robot.

The comparative study on the reliability indices from different sample numbers using the Monte Carlo simulation method has demonstrated that the results from a large enough sample number are related to those from a small sample number with high correlation indices.

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{advances}} in myoelectric prosthetic technology have enabled more complex movements and interactions with objects, {{but the lack}} of natural haptic feedback makes object manipulation difficult to perform. Our research effort aims to develop haptic feedback systems for improving user performance in object manipulation. Specifically, in this work we explore the effectiveness of vibratory tactile feedback of slip information for grasping objects without slipping. A user interacts with a virtual environment to complete a virtual grasp and hold task using a Sensable Phantom. Force feedback simulates contact with objects, and vibratory tactile feedback alerts the user when a virtual object is slipping from the grasp. Using this task, we found that tactile feedback significantly improved a user’s ability to detect and respond to slip and to recover the slipping object when visual feedback was not available. This advantage of tactile feedback is especially important in conjunction with force feedback, which tends to reduce a subject’s grasping forces and therefore encourage more slips. Our results demonstrate the potential of slip feedback to improve a prosthesis user’s ability to interact with objects with less visual attention, aiding in performance of everyday manipulation tasks. <b>Index</b> Terms—haptics, prosthetics, <b>slip</b> feedback, vibrotactile feedback F...|$|R

However, by creating an offset between the CoM and the hip, and herewith introducing coupling between the pitching and CoM-dynamics, {{the performance of the}} running robot might possibly increase. In this simulation study, we calculated the optimal CoM-location for a running robot with hip actuation. We measured the performance of the system as the largest step-down and push that can be corrected in one or two steps. We found that the largest step-down can be corrected in one step when the CoM is located above the hip. The largest push on the other hand can be corrected when the CoM is located under the hip. For two-steps recovery strategies, placing the CoM exactly on the hip is the worst option out of all possible CoM-locations. In this case, the corresponding disturbance rejection is approximately a factor 10 worse than for the optimal CoM-location. Therefore, we conclude that placing the CoM of the torso on the hip is far from optimal. <b>Index</b> Terms—running robot, <b>SLIP,</b> spring-mass model, hip actuation, disturbance rejection, center of mass location, largest disturbance.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{theoretical}} analysis of the internal lobe pump which is a particular type of positive displacement rotary pump. The main components of the pump are the rotors: usually the outer one is characterised by lobes with circular shape, while the inner rotor profile is determined as conjugate to the other. For this reason the first topic presented here is the definition of the geometry of the rotors starting from the design parameters. The choice of these parameters is subject to some limitations in order to avoid inner rotor undercutting and to limit the pressure angle between the rotors. Now we will consider the design optimisation. The first step is the determination of the instantaneous flow rate in function of the design parameters. This allows us to calculate two performance indexes commonly used for the study of positive displacement pumps: the flow rate irregularity and the specific flow rate. These indexes are used to optimise the design of the pump and to obtain the sets of optimum design parameters. Finally further considerations are presented regarding the calculation and the use of other performance <b>indexes,</b> the specific <b>slipping</b> and the rotor curvature, which are particularly suitable for giving more elements for the analysis of this case...|$|R

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Electron Back-Scattering Diffraction (EBSD) studies revealed that the deformation microstructures of both metals evolves from low-angled micro bands and dislocation cells after N= 2 passes towards more equiaxed, homogeneous subgrain/grain structures comprismg higher-angles of misorientation after N = 8 passes. In both metals, the percentage rise in ~ 3 and random boundaries are attributed to mechanisms that favour low-energy boundary configurations during ECAE. Texture evolution involves gradual changes in individual component strengths during multi-pass ECAE.

Slipmeters and human gaits were mea-sured by high speed camera and force plate to find and compare their dynamic and kinematic characteristics. Results: The contact pressures and built-up ratio were below those of subjects.

40|$|The Beg-er-Vil coastal site (Quiberon, Morbihan, France), {{initially}} excavated in the 1980 s, {{and more}} extensively since 2012, {{is exposed to}} strong marine and anthropic erosion. At the present time, the main challenge is to define {{the status of the}} site by describing its formation dynamics. This necessitates investigating the taphonomic and erosive mechanisms using a combined method adapted to the shell midden levels, before undertaking spatial analysis. The archaeological level is protected by a thick dune and is subdivided into several stratigraphic units (SU), which record several changes in the function of the site. It is made up of accumulations of shell pockets covered in sandy sediments. The micromorphological analysis shows that this waste area seems to develop into an area of activities and movement. These surfaces also record alternating dry and wet seasonal conditions, but with no phase of abandonment. Systematic pH measurements show variations of 7. 7 to 9. 0 depending on the layers, corresponding to a slightly alkaline to alkaline acid-basic status. The mapping of measurements can be correlated to structures and archaeological remains of organic origin. The excavation shows that the division of the dwelling area was guided by topographic factors, with a circular dwelling 3. 50 m in diameter installed on a flat zone and a shell waste zone on a slope towards the sea. Numerous fire-related activities were also carried out in this zone (pits, hearths). Spatial analysis by GIS shows a high concentration of recorded objects (lithics, bones, shells) {{to the west of the}} excavated area, in the shell level. Marine erosion is the main erosive factor limiting our knowledge of the site. The distance to the coastline was estimated after reconstruction of the relative sea level during the Holocene using the “Sea-Level <b>Index</b> Points” (<b>SLIPs)</b> methodology. Three SLIPs indicate a relative sealevel position between − 15. 5 m and − 11 m and a foreshore area at a depth between − 7. 15 and − 14. 02 m around 6200 BCE. This paleogeographic reconstruction approach indicates that the site of Beg-er-Vil was located a few hundred to a few kilometres from the coastline. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

The transformed conservation equations are solved numerically subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions using a second-order accurate implicit finite-difference Keller Box technique. The numerical code is validated with previous studies. The {{influence of a}} number of emerging non-dimensional parameters, namely the Weissenberg number (We), the power law <b>index</b> (n), Velocity <b>slip</b> (Sf), Thermal jump (ST), Prandtl number (Pr) and dimensionless tangential coordinate () on velocity and temperature evolution in the boundary layer regime are examined in detail. Furthermore, the effects of these parameters on surface heat transfer rate and local skin friction are also investigated. Validation with earlier Newtonian studies is presented and excellent correlation achieved. It is found that velocity, skin friction and heat transfer rate (Nusselt number) is increased with increasing Weissenberg number (We), whereas the temperature is decreased. Increasing power law index (n) enhances velocity and heat transfer rate but decreases temperature and skin friction. An increase in Thermal jump (ST) is observed to decrease velocity, temperature, local skin friction and Nusselt number. Increasing Velocity slip (Sf) is observed to increase velocity and heat transfer rate but decreases temperature and local skin friction. An increasing Prandtl number, (Pr), is found to decrease both velocity and temperature. The study is relevant to chemical materials processing applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{target of}} the {{activities}} described in the PhD thesis, fixed in collaboration with a motorsport racing team, with a high performance vehicle manufacturing company and with a tyre research and development technical centre {{is the development of}} a procedure able to estimate tyre interaction characteristics, reproducing them in simulation environments taking into account the fundamental friction and thermal phenomena concerning with tyre/road interaction. A first tool, called TRICK, has been developed with the aim to process data acquired from experimental test sessions, estimating tyre interaction forces and <b>slip</b> <b>indices.</b> Once characterized the vehicle, filtering and sensors output correction techniques have been employed on the available data, creating a robust procedure able to generate as an output a "virtual telemetry" and, following a specifically defined track driving routine, to provide tyre interaction experimental curves. TRICK virtual telemetry can be employed as an input for the second tool, TRIP-ID, developed with the aim to identify the parameters of a Pacejka Magic Formula tyre model. The advantage of this kind of procedure is the possibility to simulate the behaviour of a tyre without the bench characterizations provided by tyremakers, with the further benefit to reproduce the real interactions with road and the phenomena involved with it, commonly neglected in bench data. Among such phenomena, {{one of the most important}} is surely the effect that temperature induces on tyre performances, especially in racing applications. For this reason a specific model, called TRT, has been realized and characterized by means of proper thermodynamic tests, becoming a fundamental instrument for the simulation of a tyre behaviour as close to reality as possible. One of the most useful features provided by the model is the prediction of the so called "bulk temperature", recognized as directly linked with the tyre frictional performances. With the aim to analyse and understand the complex phenomena concerning with local contact between viscoelastic materials and rough surfaces, GrETA grip model has been developed. The main advantage to which the employment of the grip model conducts is constituted by the possibility to predict the variations induced by different tread compounds or soils on vehicle dynamics, leading to the definition of a setup able to optimise performances as a function of tyre the working conditions. The described models and procedures can cooperate, generating a many-sided and powerful instrument of analysis and simulation; the main features of the available employment solutions can be summarised as follows: 	full geometric, thermodynamic, viscoelastic and structural characterization of tyres on which the analyses are focused; 	estimation of the tyre interaction characteristic curves from experimental outdoor test data; 	definition of a standard track driving procedure that employs tyres in multiple dynamic and thermal conditions; 	identification of Pacejka Magic Formula tyre models parameters on the basis of the estimated tyre interaction characteristic curves; 	estimation of surface, bulk and inner liner tyre temperatures for variable working conditions and real-time reproduction of tyre thermodynamic behaviour in simulation applications; 	correlation of tyre thermal conditions with friction phenomena observable at the interface with road; 	prediction of tyre frictional behaviour at tread compound and soil roughness variations; 	modelling of tyre interaction by means of MF innovative formulations able to take into account grip and thermodynamic effects on vehicle dynamics; 	definition of the optimal wheels and vehicle setup in order to provide the maximum possible performances improvement...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this dissertation was to analyze surface contact interaction at different length scales and to elucidate the effects of material properties (e. g., adhesion and mechanical properties), normal and shear (friction) surface tractions, and topography parameters (e. g., roughness) on contact deformation. To accomplish this objective, a surface adhesion model based on an interatomic potential was incorporated into finite element contact models of rough surfaces exhibiting multi-scale roughness described by statistical and fractal geometry models. The problem of a rigid sphere in contact with an elastic-plastic half-space was first examined {{in the light of}} finite element simulations. Four post-yield deformation regimes were identified and the boundaries of neighboring regimes were obtained by curve-fitting of finite element results. Material hardness was shown to significantly deviate from the similarity solution with decreasing elastic modulus-to-yield strength ratio and the logarithmic dependence of the mean contact pressure on the indentation depth was found to hold only when the plastic zone was completely surrounded by elastic material. Constitutive equations were first derived for elastic-perfectly plastic half-spaces from curve-fitting finite element results and were then extended to isotropic, power-law hardening half-spaces, using the concept of the effective strain, which correlates the indentation depth with the indenter size. Finite element simulations of unloading process and repetitive normal contact were used to correlate the residual indentation depth and the dissipated plastic energy with the maximum indentation depth. Elastic shakedown, plastic shakedown, and ratcheting were identified by tracking the accumulation of plasticity for different values of maximum contact load and elastic modulus-to-yield strength ratio. The semi-infinite half-space was characterized by three different regions, named ratcheting region, shakedown region and elastic region, as the distance to contact surface increases. The obtained results have direct implication in material property measurements obtained with indentation method, particularly for materials exhibiting strain hardening behavior, and provide insight into the accumulation of plasticity due to repetitive contact loading, which is important in the understanding of the contact fatigue life of contact-mode devices. Sliding contact between a rigid fractal surface exhibiting multi-scale roughness and an elastic-plastic half-space was examined to elucidate rough-surface deformation due to small-amplitude reciprocating sliding (fretting). Stick-slip at the asperity scale was analyzed based on Mindlin's theory and a friction model that accounts for both adhesion and plowing effects. Numerical results yield insight into the effects of surface roughness, contact pressure, oscillation amplitude, elastic modulus-to-yield strength ratio, and interfacial adhesion on the friction force, <b>slip</b> <b>index,</b> and energy dissipation. The results of this study illustrate the important role of the contact load and surface topography on the energy dissipation and fretting wear of small-amplitude oscillatory contacts. Surface adhesion modeled as surface traction obeying the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential was incorporated into the contact analysis of a rigid sphere indenting an elastic half-space to study contact instabilities associated with instantaneous surface contact (jump-in) and detachment (jump-out). This surface traction was introduced into a finite element contact model in the form of nonlinear spring elements and the jump-in/jump-out condition obtained analytically was confirmed by finite element results. Then, adhesive contact between a rigid sphere and an elastic-plastic half-space was analyzed and the effect of plasticity on the pull-off force and the commencement of contact instabilities was interpreted in terms of a modified Tabor parameter. The developed finite element model with nonlinear spring elements representing adhesive surface interaction provides a physics-based, computationally-efficient technique for studying adhesive contacts. The obtained results provide explanation for the contact instabilities encountered during surface probing with microprobe tips and stiction (permanent adhesion) in contact-mode microdevices. Adhesive contact between a rigid sphere and a layered medium analyzed with the finite element method shed light into adhesion-induced contact deformation. Two modes of surface detachment were observed for perfect bonding of the film to the substrate - brittle- and ductile-like surface detachment. Simulation results illustrate the effects of the maximum surface separation, film thickness, film-to-substrate elastic property mismatch, and substrate yield strength on the mode of surface detachment and residual deformation. Introducing a cohesive model that allows for crack formation and growth along the film/substrate interface in the previous finite element model, a residual cohesive zone was found at the crack tip after complete unloading. Contact instabilities and interface delamination were interpreted by the competing effects of surface adhesion and interfacial cohesion. Crack closure and crack-tip opening displacement (CTOD) were studied by performing a parametric study of the cohesive strength, interfacial energy, surface energy, surface adhesive strength, substrate yield strength, and initial defect size. The obtained results can be used to explain thin-film failure in contact systems due to the effect of adhesion and to improve the endurance of thin-film media subjected to surface tractions. Adhesive contact of two elastic rough surfaces was analyzed by integrating asperity-scale constitutive equations into the model of Greenwood and Williamson (1966) to account for the effect of contact instabilities at asperity level on the macroscopic contact response. The strength of adhesion was found to be mostly affected by the Tabor parameter and the surface roughness. The widely used adhesion parameter of Fuller and Tabor (1977) was shown to be appropriate only for contact systems characterized by a high Tabor parameter. Therefore, a new adhesion parameter that governs the strength of adhesion of contact systems with a low Tabor parameter was introduced. Finally, a generalized adhesion parameter was derived by using the concept of the effective interatomic separation, defined as the ratio of the elastic stretch due to adhesion and the equilibrium interatomic distance. The research carried out in this dissertation provides fundamental understanding of the evolution of the stress and strain fields in contacting surfaces, the evolution of plasticity in indentation, the development of friction and dissipation of energy in fretting contacts, the occurrence of adhesion-induced contact instabilities and interfacial delamination, and the factors affecting the strength of adhesion for rough surfaces in normal contact. The results of this thesis have direct implications in various technologies, including high-efficiency gas turbines, magnetic storage devices, and microelectromechanical systems...|$|R
