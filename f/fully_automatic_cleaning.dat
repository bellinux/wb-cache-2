40|$|Abstract Background The {{reprocessing}} {{of medical}} endoscopes {{is carried out}} using <b>automatic</b> <b>cleaning</b> and disinfection machines. The documentation and archiving of records of properly conducted reprocessing procedures is the last and increasingly {{important part of the}} reprocessing cycle for flexible endoscopes. Methods This report describes a new computer program designed to monitor and document the automatic reprocessing of flexible endoscopes and accessories in <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> washer-disinfectors; it does not contain nor compensate the manual cleaning step. The program implements national standards for the monitoring of hygiene in flexible endoscopes and the guidelines for the reprocessing of medical products. No FDA approval has been obtained up to now. The advantages of this newly developed computer program are firstly that it simplifies the documentation procedures of medical endoscopes and that it could be used universally with any washer-disinfector and that it is independent of the various interfaces and software products provided by the individual suppliers of washer-disinfectors. Results The computer program presented here has been tested on a total of four washer-disinfectors in more than 6000 medical examinations within 9 months. Conclusions We present for the first time an electronic documentation system for automated washer-disinfectors for medical devices e. g. flexible endoscopes which can be used on any washer-disinfectors that documents the procedures involved in the <b>automatic</b> <b>cleaning</b> process and can be easily connected to most hospital documentation systems. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The <b>automatic</b> <b>cleaning</b> {{requirements}} of spinneret orifices were analyzed. The three-dimensional positioning system for spinneret orifices cleaning, combining the XY horizontal motion platform and Z axis electric translational platform, was determined. The cleaning device of spinneret orifices was designed. The control system of <b>automatic</b> <b>cleaning</b> for spinneret orifices was developed based on Labview and the experimental {{analysis of the}} prototype was done in this paper...|$|R

Most electropneumatic paintball guns feature this mode. The <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> mode {{can be added to}} any electropneumatic marker by installing a customized logic board, or buying a completely new electronic trigger frame.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fully</b> <b>automatic</b> mechanims for {{rubber band}} guns are {{analogous}} to <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearm mechanisms, {{in that the}} energy used to drive the gun's mechanism {{is derived from the}} same source as that which provides energy to propel the projectiles. In the case of <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> rubber band guns, the mechanism-driving energy is the elastic potential energy stored in the stretched rubber band ammunition loaded onto the gun. <b>Fully</b> <b>automatic</b> designs pose significant challenges to designers, such as how to control rate of fire.|$|R

50|$|It is {{difficult}} to legally acquire <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearms at American gun shows (as opposed to the semiautomatic-only versions of these firearms that are legal on the U.S. civilian market), due to National Firearms Act (NFA). To legally purchase or transfer a <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearm, U.S. citizens must pay a $200 transfer tax, submit {{a full set of}} fingerprints on FBI Form FD-258, obtain certification provided by a chief law enforcement officer ("CLEO": the local chief of police, sheriff of the county, head of the State police, or State or local district attorney or prosecutor), and obtain final approval from the BATF on a Form 4 transfer of NFA registration to the new owner. All private citizens must wait, typically months, before receiving the tax stamp for the $200 tax paid, authorizing taking possession of the already paid-for <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearm. Until in receipt of the tax stamp, the Class III dealer retains control of the <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearm. In addition, only <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearms manufactured before the Firearm Owner's Protection Act of 1986 are permitted to be transferred. No <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearms recovered in Mexico have been traced to the United States.|$|R

50|$|A {{machine gun}} is a <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> mounted or {{portable}} firearm designed to fire bullets {{in quick succession}} from an ammunition belt or magazine, typically {{at a rate of}} 300 to 1800 rounds per minute. Not all <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearms are machine guns. Submachine guns, rifles, assault rifles, shotguns, pistols or cannons may be capable of <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> fire, but are not designed for sustained fire. As a class of military rapid-fire guns, machine guns are <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> weapons designed to be used as support weapons and generally used when attached to a mount or fired from the ground on a bipod or tripod. Many (but not all) machine guns also use belt feeding and open bolt operation, features not normally found on rifles.|$|R
