40|$|AbstractExperiment on {{electrical}} parameters variation of different destruction type coals under uniaxial compression are studied. The {{results show that}} {{electrical parameters}}’ change curves of the loaded raw coal samples and briquette {{have a very good}} consistency; the consistency of dielectric constant curve and coal stress - strain curve is better than the resistivity curve. The resistivity curve of loaded coal in general is “concave” shape with the stress - strain curves, and the dielectric constant curve is “convex” shape generally. Compared to the initial <b>electrical</b> <b>parameter</b> values of the coal samples, the <b>electrical</b> <b>parameter</b> change rate of raw coal samples and briquette are generally higher than 13 %, up to 165 %, the <b>electrical</b> <b>parameter</b> change rate of raw coal samples is generally higher than briquette. The <b>electrical</b> <b>parameter</b> change of loaded coal and its stress have significantly coherence, electrical parameters variation of loaded coal better reflects the formation, development and transfixion of micro-fractures, and the characteristics of changes in internal structure in the failure process of coal rock. In the case of uniaxial compression, coal is dominated by electronic conductivity in the I, II phases, and ionic conductivity in III, IV phases, the dielectric constant changes of loaded coal have a close relation with its changes in the structure, cracks closure and cracked degree...|$|E

40|$|Identification {{of all the}} <b>electrical</b> <b>parameters</b> of Induction Machines (IMs) is a {{prerequisite}} for successful model-based control and/or fault detection. Various approaches have been proposed previously: off-line experiments under alternating stationary conditions, least squares batch and on-line estimation, to name only a few. Both continuous and discrete time have been considered, all of them utilizing models for symmetrical IMs. Existing methods for identification of the <b>electrical</b> <b>parameters</b> of the IM are strictly speaking valid only at stationary conditions, which limitation results in either poor dynamics excitation or gross approximation errors, depending on the working conditions of the motor. Unrealistic assumptions about the rotor's angular acceleration are also often employed. The topic of identification of all <b>electrical</b> <b>parameters</b> of faulty IMs has not been addressed so far. In this paper, a method for on-line observer-based estimation of all <b>electrical</b> <b>parameters</b> of symmetrical IMs as well as IMs with faulty stator is presented aiming primarily at fault tolerant control and fault detection.
