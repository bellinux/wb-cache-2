50|$|A prism coupler is a prism {{designed}} to couple a substantial {{fraction of the}} power contained in {{a beam of light}} (e.g., a laser beam) into a thin film {{to be used as a}} waveguide without the need for precision polishing of the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film,</b> without the need for sub-micrometer alignment precision of the beam and the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film,</b> and without the need for matching the numerical aperture of the beam to the film. Using a prism coupler, a beam coupled into a thin film can have a diameter hundreds of times the thickness of the film. Invention of the coupler contributed to the initiation of a field of study known as integrated optics.|$|E
50|$|Most printer/processes are {{computer}} controlled. The {{front of}} the film is fed into the printing gate. Sensors see the film and forward the film to the first frame. DX codes on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> are read by the printer and the film channel is selected accordingly to give the optimum result.|$|E
5000|$|Sprocket hole {{photography}} is {{a style of}} photography that exposes <b>the</b> full width <b>of</b> 35 mm film, creating a photograph punctuated by the [...] "sprocket holes" [...] (perforations) along <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film.</b> Usually, this style involves <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a modified medium format camera, since a 35 mm camera ordinarily will not expose <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Vertical or Inclined Form-Fill-Seal PackagingFor a {{vertical}} form-fill-seal <b>the</b> <b>film</b> approaches <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> a long hollow conical tube, {{which is called}} the forming tube. When <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plastic is near the tube, <b>the</b> outer <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> form flaps that wrap around the conical forming tube. <b>The</b> <b>film</b> is pulled downward around <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube and {{a vertical}} heat-sealing bar clamps onto <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> to create <b>the</b> [...] "fin Seal", bonding <b>the</b> <b>film</b> by melting <b>the</b> seam edges together.|$|R
50|$|Smooth wheels with {{triangular}} pins called sprockets engage perforations punched {{into one}} or both <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> stock. These serve to set <b>the</b> pace <b>of</b> <b>film</b> movement through <b>the</b> projector and any associated sound playback system.|$|R

50|$|A scene-by-scene color {{correction}} option was later added to film chains. This was first done by notching the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> where a color change was wanted. Later, machines that counted the sprocket holes were used. At the mark (the notch or the electronic sprocket-count number) the next stored {{color correction}} would occur. See color grading for more information.|$|E
5000|$|Distortion of {{fast-moving}} subjects: {{although no}} part of the film is exposed for longer than the time set on the dial, one <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> is exposed an appreciable time after the other, so that a horizontally moving shutter will, for example, elongate or shorten the image of a car speeding in the same or the opposite direction to the shutter movement.|$|E
50|$|When {{exposed to}} {{moisture}} in the environment and various pollutants, the image silver will corrode, creating a reflective metallic sheen on the emulsion side.

50|$|Buckypaper with {{a height}} that {{is larger than}} 500 micrometres (0.5 mm) is called a buckydisc, being thicker than buckypaper and not paper-like. Moreover, when casting in water, <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> can lift due to surface tension effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{remaining}} solvent in the system that can pull carbon nanotubes closer together.|$|R
50|$|As digital sound became <b>the</b> {{standard}} <b>of</b> {{sound reproduction}} in the 21st century, 35 and 70mm films have increasingly included a digital version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack on <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> strip. Most films {{continue to be}} processed with both digital and analog soundtracks {{so that they can}} be read by projection systems in any movie theater.|$|R
50|$|In 1973 Kodak {{introduced}} Ektasound—magnetic recording on {{the actual}} Super 8 film. The sound track was added on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> opposite to the perforations. Standard 8mm had the stripe between the perforations and the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> which made good contact with a magnetic head problematic. A balance stripe was added on the opposite edge to facilitate spooling of the film. The Ektasound cartridge was deeper than the silent cartridge to allow access of the camera's recording head. Thus, silent cameras could not accept Ektasound cartridges, but Ektasound cameras and projectors accepted silent cartridges. Projectors, that could record and play sound, appeared before sound cameras. The sound was recorded 18 frames {{in advance of the}} picture (as opposed to 56 frames for standard 8mm). This short distance of just 3 inches facilitated the relatively compact size of the later sound cartridges. Some projectors used the balance stripe to provide a second channel for stereo sound.|$|E
50|$|Most cameras use pulsed {{timing marks}} along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> (either {{inside or outside}} of the film perforations) {{produced}} by sparks or later by LEDs. These allow accurate measurement of the film speed {{and in the case}} of streak or smear images, velocity measurement of the subject. These pulses are usually cycled at 10, 100, 1000 Hz depending on the speed setting of the camera.|$|E
50|$|Visible ink is {{sometimes}} utilized to imprint on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> - again in manufacturing - {{at the time}} of perforations. The ink, which is not affected by photographic chemicals, is normally printed onto the base surface of the film. The numbers are visible on both the raw stock (unexposed) and processed (exposed and developed) film. This method is primarily utilized for black & white negative film.|$|E

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{of a cold}} technology (< 950 °C) has been analysed by X-ray topography {{at different stages of}} its elaboration. It is shown first that an elastic deformation occurs straight below <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> pattern. Then, point defects are generated at the polysilicon-silicon interface upon oxidation. Finally the crystalline quality is perturbed in the whole bulk wafer upon further chemical and heat treatments...|$|R
5000|$|Damaged {{or broken}} {{perforations}} {{can lead to}} a tear in <b>the</b> <b>film</b> as it runs through <b>the</b> projector. [...] <b>Film</b> is commonly checked for broken sprocket holes before presentation, a process known as [...] "spooling". Mechanical devices exist for this purpose, but the classic method is to place the finger and thumb of a gloved hand on <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film,</b> which is mounted on a winding bench, and to slowly run <b>the</b> <b>film</b> through <b>the</b> fingers, feeling for snags.|$|R
50|$|Neighbours (French title: Voisins) is a 1952 anti-war film by Scottish-Canadian filmmaker Norman McLaren. Produced at the National Film Board of Canada in Montreal, {{the film}} uses the {{technique}} known as pixilation, an animation technique using live actors as stop-motion objects. McLaren created the soundtrack {{of the film}} by scratching the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film,</b> creating various blobs, lines, and triangles which the projector read as sound. Pablo Picasso called this the greatest film ever made.|$|E
5000|$|To {{synchronize}} double-system footage, the clapper board {{which typically}} starts a take {{is used as}} a reference point for the editor to match the picture to the sound (provided the scene and take are also called out so that the editor knows which picture take goes with any given sound take). It also permits scene and take numbers and other essential information to be seen on the film itself. Aaton cameras have a system called AatonCode that can [...] "jam sync" [...] with a timecode-based audio recorder and prints a digital timecode directly on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> itself. However, the most commonly used system at the moment is unique identifier numbers exposed on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> by the film stock manufacturer (KeyKode is the name for Kodak's system). These are then logged (usually by a computer editing system, but sometimes by hand) and recorded along with audio timecode during editing. In the case of no better alternative, a handclap can work if done clearly and properly, but often a quick tap on the microphone (provided it is in frame for this gesture) is preferred.|$|E
5000|$|By {{having the}} sound and picture sync this way this would save the expense and time of making an optical print or {{magnetic}} sound track strip on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film.</b> [...] The Sepmag would follow a projector or a telecine or a hand-cranked or motorized film viewer on a workbench. The sepmag sound follower would stay {{in sync with the}} film. In post production work, a dubbed sound track of sound effects, or a second language, could be added to other channels of the sepmag.|$|E
40|$|Pyroelectric Scanning Microscopy (PSM) {{has been}} {{developed}} to enable mapping of surface polarization in ferroelectric thin <b>films,</b> in particular <b>the</b> copolymer polyvinylidene fluoride trifluororethylene, or P(VDF-TrFE). The Chynoweth method for dynamically measuring pyroelectric current is employed {{in conjunction with a}} micropositioning system to construct two-dimensional images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> polarization. These images have revealed enhancement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polarization near <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> below <b>the</b> average coercive field, with the center 2 ̆ 7 s polarization increasing thereafter to meet the edge value at saturation...|$|R
50|$|The format was an {{immediate}} success, but retains a number of inherent problems and quirks, mostly connected {{with the fact that}} the spool needs to be removed and reversed half way through filming. This procedure is tricky for the inexperienced user and needs to be carried out in subdued light to avoid fogging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> central six feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finished <b>film</b> includes a characteristic burst of light corresponding to the reversal point (unless <b>the</b> <b>film</b> is again edited and spliced).|$|R
30|$|All <b>the</b> <b>films</b> display with <b>the</b> fringes {{at higher}} {{wavelengths}} of 500  nm, which indicates <b>the</b> homogenous structure <b>of</b> deposited CdS layers. <b>The</b> absorption <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>films</b> have tolerance between 500 and 550  nm {{that refers to}} band gap value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>films.</b> It can be observed that <b>the</b> transmittance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>films</b> increased considerably with increasing the annealing temperature up to 500  °C. <b>The</b> increment <b>of</b> transmittance from 40 % to over 70 % by post annealing treatment may caused by reduction in voids and lattice imperfections, increase in grain size which is in correlation with measured value of crystal size in Table  1.|$|R
5000|$|Occasionally, as {{the film}} passes through the gate, {{friction}} can cause small slivers of celluloid to break off and stick {{in the side of}} the opening. This debris is called hairs. A [...] "hair in the gate" [...] will remain in front of the film and create a dark line that sticks into the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> frame as the camera is filming a shot. A hair can ruin the shot and is almost impossible to fix in post production without being removed digitally.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{humor in}} {{animation}} {{is based on}} the fourth wall aspect of the film frame itself, with some animation showing characters leaving what is assumed to be the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> or the film malfunctioning. This latter one is used often in films as well.This hearkens back to some early cartoons, where characters were aware of the fact they were in a cartoon, specifically the fact they could look at the credits and be aware of something that isn't part of the story as presented. These jokes include - ...|$|E
50|$|Until the mid-1970s, ENG teams shot both main A-roll and {{secondary}} B-roll footage on 16 mm film. Sound was integrated onto the film {{by way of}} a magnetic stripe at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film.</b> The A-roll and B-roll scenes, shot at 24 frames per second, were converted to the television frame rate of 30 fps using a telecine system consisting of two film projectors, one showing the main A-roll footage and the other showing the B-roll. The sound from the A-roll footage was used, or sound from narration or voiceover, while MOS images from the B-roll were intercut as desired.|$|E
5000|$|He is {{recognized}} for his innovative technique creating miniature still photography [...] from actual landscapes by simulating shallow depth <b>of</b> field via <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> tilt-shift lens photography. Barbieri's technique simulates <b>the</b> shallow depth <b>of</b> field effect of macro photography by tilting the lens's angle to <b>the</b> back plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camera, which creates a gradual blurring {{at the top}} and bottom edges, or left and right <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filmed</b> image. <b>The</b> technique is called selected focus and the effect is that a picture of an actual city looks like <b>the</b> picture <b>of</b> a model.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe polymer {{cast film}} process induces some {{geometrical}} defects : the width reduction (neck-in defect) and <b>the</b> inhomogeneous decrease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thickness distribution (<b>edge</b> bead defect). These defects prevent from predicting <b>the</b> <b>film</b> final dimensions and thus {{from a high}} industrial productivity. In this paper, a numerical model developed by the authors is used to test and optimize two technological solutions, aimed at reducing the geometrical defects : a localized air cooling on <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> at <b>the</b> die exit and an "encapsulation die" which enables <b>the</b> extrusion <b>of</b> a high melt strength polymer along <b>the</b> outer <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a core polymer.

5000|$|Striped {{magnetic}} film is motion picture film in which 'stripes' of magnetic oxide {{are placed on}} the film between the sprocket holes and the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film,</b> and sometimes also between the sprocket holes and the image. Each of these stripes has one channel of the audio recorded on it. This technique was first introduced in September, 1953 by Hazard E. Reeves for Cinemascope. Four tracks are present on the film: Left, Center, Right and Surround. This 35mm four-track magnetic sound format was used from 1954 through 1982 for [...] "roadshow" [...] screenings of big-budget feature films.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} assist in keeping the glass {{attached}} to the security window film, and the frames, Shatter Safe Security Window Films recommend that the glass must {{be attached to the}} window frame (not the gasket) so that the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> becomes {{an integral part of the}} glass and the frame. There are two common methods of accomplishing this. One is wet glaze utilizing a Building Compound adhesive more commonly known as Dow Corning 995. The other is a mechanical attachment system that utilizes metals of some sort that are attached to the window frame and cover part of the exposed window films.|$|E
50|$|The exposed film, either 35mm or 17.5mm (35mm {{split in}} half, to save expense), {{travelled}} {{in a continuous}} band from the camera, usually atop a remote broadcast vehicle, into a machine that developed and fixed the image. The film was then run through a flying spot scanner (so called because it moved a focused beam of light {{back and forth across}} the image), and electronically converted from a negative to a positive image. Depending on the equipment, the time from camera to scanner could be a minute or less. An optical soundtrack was recorded onto the film, between the perforations and the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>film,</b> at the same time the image was taken to keep the sound and image in synchronization.|$|E
