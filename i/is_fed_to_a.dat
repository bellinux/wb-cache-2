25|$|If {{a filling}} station allows {{customers}} to pay at the register, {{the data from}} the dispensers may be transmitted via RS232, RS485 or Ethernet to the point of sale, usually inside the filling station's building, and fed into the station's cash register operating system. The cash register system gives a limited control over the fuel dispenser, and is usually limited to allowing the clerks to turn the pumps on and off. A separate system is used to monitor the fuel tank's status and quantities of fuel. With sensors directly in the fuel tank, the data <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> terminal in the back room, where it can be downloaded or printed out. Sometimes this method is bypassed, with the fuel tank data transmitted directly into an external database.|$|E

25|$|The process uses a cobalt–manganese–bromide catalyst. The bromide source can be sodium bromide, {{hydrogen}} bromide or tetrabromoethane where bromine {{functions as a}} regenerative source of free radicals. In this process, acetic acid is the solvent and oxygen from compressed air is the oxidant. The combination of bromine and acetic acid {{is found to be}} highly corrosive and hence the equipment is lined with titanium. A feed mixture containing p-xylene, acetic acid, the catalyst system, and compressed air <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> reactor. The oxidation of the methyl group takes place in two steps where p-xylene is converted to p-toluic acid and the byproduct undesirable 4-carboxybenzaldehyde along with crude p-toluic acid. It is further purified to obtain the p-toluic acid with the removal of the 4-carboxybenzaldehyde using crystallization, centrifugation and filtration. 98% of the p-xylene is reacted to give more than 95mol% TPA. The solvent losses are comparatively low, and hence the Amoco process is followed by the industries.|$|E

The 14C urea breath test has been largely replaced by the 13C urea breath test, which has no radiation issues.|$|E

The guitar amplifier {{is placed in the}} live room or isolation booth of the recording studio and is set up to produce the desired tonal quality, including distortion character and room reverberation. A microphone is placed near the guitar speaker and a new track is recorded, producing the re-amplified, processed track. The microphone cable is connected to the mixing console or mic preamp using a cable, as usual, without using a bridging device.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the heart}} of a Sirius {{receiver}} is a custom application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip called the Baseband Integrated Circuit currently the STA240, which is produced by STMicroelectronics. The chip contains embedded ARM7TDMI and ARM946E-S microprocessors synthesized from IP cores. Every baseband has a unique Electronic Serial Number (or Sirius ID). Another major section of a Sirius receiver is the tuner. The tuner is also a custom ASIC, the STA210. The tuner connects to the antenna, and receives the incoming satellite and terrestrial signals at 2.315GHz and downconverts them to intermediate frequency signals at around 75MHz. The strength of the signals is approximately −50dBm in clear-sky conditions. The IF signals are fed to the STA240, which are digitized, demodulated, error-corrected, de-interleaved, and decrypted using specialized circuits on the chip. The baseband processor utilizes a 16 MB SDRAM memory to buffer four seconds of one of the satellite signals in order to bring it into time coincidence with the other for Maximal-ratio combining. On newer receivers with a [...] "pause" [...] feature, a dual-port PSRAM is employed to store up to 60 minutes of the selected channel. The baseband processor outputs digital audio over a Serial Peripheral Interface, which <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> D/A converter to produce the analog audio signal. The front-end of a Sirius receiver is called the head unit, required to display descriptive text (such as the category, channel, artist, and song name) and provide controls to the user. This is implemented by the third-party designers of Sirius-ready receivers, using a microprocessor of their choice.|$|E

We focus on receivers that split the received signal power into two streams; one <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> information decoding block and the other <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> energy harvester block. We use a weight perturbation Lyapunov approach to optimally schedule data admission and allocate the powers and the energy splitting factors.
