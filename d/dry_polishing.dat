40|$|Abstract. Polishing is a {{secondary}} process in machining. The application of polishing process {{is crucial to}} obtained final appearance of a product. This study addresses parameter analysis on flat and <b>dry</b> <b>polishing</b> to determine the most influence parameter which effect surface roughness. For this purpose, Design of Experiment (DOE) {{is used as a}} methodology in the analysis. The polishing process is conducted on Comau robotic cell and the combination of grit size, polishing time and polishing force are subjected on the material by using pneumatic polishing tool. Two-level factorial experiment design is conducted and result is interpreted by using statistical software. From the result it is shown that grit size and polishing time give the main effect on surface roughness. However for 2 -way interaction effect, polishing time and polishing force contribute significantly on surface roughness. This suggested that for flat and <b>dry</b> <b>polishing,</b> consideration on these parameters is an essential aspect in order to achieve a good surface finished...|$|E
30|$|The third method tested was the {{embedment}} of a microsample cross-section in {{acrylic resin}} (micro sample A 1 that {{was removed from}} the carbon tape). The microsample laid on a glass slide was embedded in a drop of acrylic resin, Technovit® 2000 LC, and polymerized with blue light for 3  min. After cured, the sample was fixed with Technovit® 2000 LC fixing paste within a Teflon mounting mould with the stratigraphy facing upwards. The mould was filled with more acrylic resin which cured for 15  min. Finally, the cross-section was revealed by <b>dry</b> <b>polishing</b> with micromesh® abrasive cloths (granulometry 600 and 8000). This method enabled the multi-layer analysis of the microsample. The composition of the micromesh® 8000 grit (aluminium oxide) was taken into account when interpreting the analytical results.|$|E
40|$|The {{electron}} microprobe is {{a proven}} instrument for particulate analysis and modifications are possible for {{in situ analysis}} of particulates in ice at temperatures near that of liquid nitrogen. Present sample requirements allow for polished samples with 0. 25 x 0. 25 dimensions to be maintained in the sample chamber of a modern electron probe (CAMECA SX- 50) at a temperature of - 150 C; larger samples are possible but at higher temperatures as determined by thermal conductivity. The major problem is transport and insertion of samples into the instrument through vacuum interlocks. The manufacturer of the above microprobe has designed an exchange mechanism to allow storage and transport of samples previously prepared for their sample holder which attaches to their instrument allowing extraction and insertion of samples while maintaining - 150 C temperature. An important test will be the capability of preparing polished surfaces of an ice-particulate sample without loss of particles and at low temperatures. While thin sections of water ice are routine, these are not examined for particulate material and are prepared at temperatures easily obtained in room-size volumes. Anticipated problems include rounding of small grains in the relatively soft ice matrix and the technical problem of <b>dry</b> <b>polishing...</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of specimen preparation and test method on the flexural strength results of monolithic zirconia. Different monolithic zirconia materials (Ceramill Zolid (Amann Girrbach, Koblach, Austria), Zenostar ZrTranslucent (Wieland Dental, Pforzheim, Germany), and DD Bio zx 2 (Dental Direkt, Spenge, Germany)) were tested with three different methods: 3 -point, 4 -point, and biaxial flexural strength. Additionally, different specimen preparation methods were applied: either <b>dry</b> <b>polishing</b> before sintering or wet polishing after sintering. Each subgroup included 40 specimens. The surface roughness was assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a profilometer whereas monoclinic phase transformation was investigated with X-ray diffraction. The {{data were analyzed using}} a three-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with respect to the three factors: zirconia, specimen preparation, and test method. One-way ANOVA was conducted for the test method and zirconia factors within the combination of two other factors. A 2 -parameter Weibull distribution assumption was applied to analyze the reliability under different testing conditions. In general, values measured using the 4 -point test method presented the lowest flexural strength values. The flexural strength findings can be grouped in the following order: 4 -point < 3 -point < biaxial. Specimens prepared after sintering showed significantly higher flexural strength values than prepared before sintering. The Weibull moduli ranged from 5. 1 to 16. 5. Specimens polished before sintering showed higher surface roughness values than specimens polished after sintering. In contrast, no strong impact of the polishing procedures on the monoclinic surface layer was observed. No impact of zirconia material on flexural strength was found. The test method and the preparation method significantly influenced the flexural strength values...|$|E
40|$|Silicon is {{the most}} widely used {{semiconductor}} material for MEMS and electronic applications. The strength of silicon has a critical impact on the reliable and accurate function of these components. In packaging assembly, reliability tests as well as in operation life the silicon die can be exposed to high stresses. For a theoretical risk assessment of die cracking due to the mentioned loadings a failure criterion is needed, which is capable to account the processing history. Therefore, the experimental characterization via fracture tests, analysis of different Si surface structures by Laser-Scanning-Microscopy (LSM) and Transmission-Electron-Microscopy (TEM) and a numerical approach using Finite Element Simulation was combined to allow failure prediction. In the fracture tests the influences of the backside grinding and the stress relief processes were investigated. The test dies were fabricated using the Dicing-before-Grinding (DBG) process with different mesh sizes of the grinding wheel. Additionally <b>dry</b> <b>polishing</b> and plasma etching were applied as stress relief processes. Bending tests are commonly used for the strength characterization of brittle materials like ceramics and silicon. The ball-ring-test was conducted to exclude edge effects on the strength, which are still under investigation in an additional part of the study. It was found that the determined fracture stresses follow a three-parametric Weibull distribution. The surface topography and roughness, respectively, was measured via LSM. TEM was applied to determine the structure of the surface-near damage-layer. In addition to the experimental investigations numerical calculations by means of Finite Element Simulations were performed in order to calculate critical fracture stresses from testing including anisotropic and geometric nonlinear effects. Furthermore, a submodeling-technique was applied to understand the effects of experimentally observed surface states on the critical stress, i. e. roughness, grinding marks, flaws, and poly Si-layers. Detailed modeling included local modeling of surface roughness on the critical strength...|$|E

Corn is an important commodity as carbohydrate-rich foodstuff besides rice. The most common problem faced by corn-based foods is the unwillingness of people to process corn into various products due to the long preparation and cooking time. Through some technological touch, an innovative product called as parboiled polished corn (jagung sosoh pratanak = JSP) was produced. It was a convenient raw material for making some indigenous corn-based foods. By using this product, {{it was expected that}} the cooking time of corn-based foods could be reduced. 	The aim of this research was to explore some indigenous corn-based foods which are potential as staple foods and to apply the parboiled polished corn (JSP) for making those indigenous foods. The research parameters were data collecting of indigenous corn-based foods (including the origin, procedure of processing, preparation and cooking time) and comparing the foods made from <b>dry</b> <b>polished</b> corn and parboiled polished corn. 	There were ten indigenous corn-based foods from Indonesia which are potential as staple foods such as nasi kemunak Batanghari (Jambi, Sumatera), lepet jagung (East Java), jagung bose (East Nusa Tenggara, kambeweno kahitela (Muna, South East Sulawesi), kambewe (Muna, South East Sulawesi), kampalusu (Muna, South East Sulawesi), katumbu (Muna, South East Sulawesi), kina gandu (Tolaki, South East Sulawesi), lapoti gandu (Tolaki, South East Sulawesi) and barobbo (South Sulawesi). The result showed that cooking time of some indigenous foods made from parboiled polished corn was shorter than those made from <b>dry</b> <b>polished</b> corn. These foods were jagung bose (20 & 25 min.), kampalusu (20 & 25 min.), kina gandu (20 & 25 min.), lapoti gandu (30 & 40 min.) and barobbo (20 & 25 min.). The other foods such as nasi kemunak Batanghari (20 & 15 min.), lepet jagung (15 & 10 min.) and katumbu (15 & 10 min.) showed the longer cooking time than those made from <b>dry</b> <b>polished</b> corn, whereas kambeweno kahitela and kambewe had the same cooking time (25 min.). The advantage of using JSP was the process could be conducted without polishing and soaking the dry corn which took until several hours. Sensory evaluation result showed that the most indigenous corn-based foods made by using <b>dry</b> <b>polished</b> corn were more acceptable in odor, color, taste and texture than those made by using JSP. Based on this research, it was concluded that (1) these ten indigenous corn-based foods were potential as staple food and (2) JSP could be processed into certain indigenous corn-based foods with the shorter cooking time and better acceptance...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces a}} fundamental concept of material removal by scratches made by ceramic media on metallic coupon {{as the basis}} for material removal by Mass Finishing process. Mass Finishing is a group o f surface improvement operations such as polishing, descaling, burnishing, cleaning, and <b>drying.</b> <b>Polishing,</b> descaling, and burnishing are abrasive operations that remove or displace material on parts being processed to attain the expected effect. These material removal operations were idealized as a sequence o f scratches. A series of experiments for generating scratches were conducted using an abrasive sphere on a flat polished surface of three distinct materials. The abrasive tool is a spherical ceramic piece with a surface roughness of 3. 7 pm and a diameter of 14. 288 mm, and the materials for the scratch test are steel, brass, and aluminum, with their surfaces polished to a finish better than 0. 1 pm. Physical properties of these materials such as yield strength, strain hardening coefficient, and strength coefficient were measured. Empirical relationships for the width and depth o f the scratch with respect to process and material characteristics were developed using dimensional analysis. The theoretical output from these relationships showed a close match with the physical data obtained from experiments. This indicated that the dimensional analysis technique is a viable tool for use in this aspect of Mass Finishing research...|$|R

6000|$|The Somali spear {{is a form}} of the Cape Assegai. A long, thin, pliant and knotty {{shaft of}} the Dibi, Diktab, and Makari trees, is <b>dried,</b> <b>polished,</b> and greased with rancid butter: it is {{generally}} of a dull yellow colour, and sometimes bound, as in Arabia, with brass wire for ornament. Care is applied to make the rod straight, or the missile flies crooked: it is garnished with an iron button at the head, and a long thin tapering head of coarse bad iron [16], made at Berberah and other places by the Tomal. The length of the shaft may be four feet eight inches; the blade varies from twenty to twenty-six inches, and the whole weapon is about seven feet long. Some polish the entire spear-head, others only its socket or ferule; commonly, however, it is all blackened by heating it to redness, and rubbing it with cow's horn. In the towns, one of these weapons is carried; on a journey and in battle two, as amongst the Tibboos,--a small javelin for throwing and a large spear reserved for the thrust. Some warriors especially amongst the Eesa, prefer a coarse heavy lance, which never leaves the hand. The Somali spear is held in various ways: generally the thumb and forefinger grasp the third nearest to the head, and the shaft resting upon the palm is made to quiver. In action, the javelin is rarely thrown at a greater distance than six or seven feet, and the heavier weapon is used for [...] "jobbing." [...] Stripped to his waist, the thrower runs forward with all the action of a Kafir, whilst the attacked bounds about and crouches to receive it upon the round targe, which it cannot pierce. He then returns the compliment, at the same time endeavouring to break the weapon thrown at him by jumping and stamping upon it. The harmless missiles being exhausted, both combatants draw their daggers, grapple with the left hand, and with the right dig hard and swift at each other's necks and shoulders. When matters come to this point, the duel is soon decided, and the victor, howling his slogan, pushes away from his front the dying enemy, and rushes off to find another opponent. A puerile weapon during the day, when a steady man can easily avoid it, the spear is terrible in night attacks or in the [...] "bush," [...] whence it can be hurled unseen. For practice, we plant a pair of slippers upright in the ground, at the distance of twelve yards, and a skilful spearman hits the mark once in every three throws.|$|R
