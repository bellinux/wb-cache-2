Because the growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger mother is absent, the growth-promoting gene passed on by the male lion father is {{unimpeded}} by a regulating gene and the resulting ligers grow far larger than either parent. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers often are fertile. Males have about a 50% chance of having a mane, but if they <b>grow</b> <b>them,</b> their manes will be modest: around 50% the size of a pure lion mane.

I am no Jayne Mansfield, I can tell you." [...] In the 2001 fiction and poetry collection of Zaffi Gousopoulos, The I. V. Lounge Reader, a character tries out lipsticks in Mansfield colors and lifting underwear to emphasize her femininity. [...] "All women aspire to be Jayne Mansfield", says a character in Drake Worthington's 2002 book, St. Vincent's Manhattan, while trying out a bra.

500|$|Nepenthes × alisaputrana (originally {{published}} as [...] "Nepenthes × alisaputraiana") is named {{in honour of}} Datuk Lamri Ali, Director of Sabah Parks. It is only known from a few remote localities within Kinabalu National Park where is grows in stunted, open vegetation over serpentine soils at around 2000 m above sea level, often amongst populations of N. burbidgeae. This plant is notable for combining the best characters of both parent species, not least {{the size of its}} pitchers, which rival those of N. rajah in volume (≤35cm high, ≤20cm wide). The other hybrids involving N. rajah do not exhibit such impressive proportions. The pitchers of N. × alisaputrana can be distinguished from those of N. burbidgeae by a broader peristome, larger lid and simply by their sheer size. The hybrid differs from its other parent, N. rajah, by its lid structure, indumentum of short, brown hairs, narrower and more cylindrical peristome, and pitcher colour, which is usually yellow-green with red or brown flecking. [...] For this reason, Phillipps and Lamb (1996) gave it the common name Leopard pitcher-plant, though this is rarely used. The peristome is green to dark red and striped with purple bands. Leaves are often slightly peltate. [...] The plant climbs well and aerial pitchers are frequently produced. N. × alisaputrana more closely resembles N. rajah than N. burbidgeae, {{but it is difficult to}} confuse this plant with either. However, this mistake has previously been made on at least one occasion; a pitcher illustrated in Insect Eating Plants & How To <b>Grow</b> <b>Them</b> (Slack, 1986) as being N. rajah was in fact N. burbidgeae × N. rajah.|$|E

Indeed, he claims that to successfully <b>grow</b> <b>them</b> a special environment needs to be created. These plants are not easy to maintain under culture. Only recently, with the help of modern technology, timers and foggers that keep the humidity constant, the growers have been finally capable of keeping them out of their natural environment for several years.|$|E

2500|$|Genetically {{modified}} {{crops are}} plants used in agriculture, the DNA {{of which has}} been modified using genetic engineering techniques. [...] In most cases, the aim is to introduce a new trait to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species. As of 2015, 26 plant species have been genetically modified and approved for commercial release in at least one country. The majority of these species contain genes that make them either tolerant to herbicides or resistant to insects. Other common traits include virus resistance, delayed ripening, modified flower colour or altered composition. In 2014, 28 countries grew GM crops, and 39 countries imported but did not <b>grow</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In both {{rural and}} urban areas, the cost of {{children}} to parents is exacerbated {{by the introduction of}} compulsory education acts and the increased need to educate children so they can take up a respected position in society. [...] Children are increasingly prohibited under law from working outside the household and make an increasingly limited contribution to the household, as school children are increasingly exempted from the expectation of making a significant contribution to domestic work. [...] Even in equatorial Africa, children (age under 5) now required to have clothes and shoes, through the body, and may even require school uniforms.

2500|$|Vegetables are {{not found}} {{often in the}} archaeological record and it is {{difficult}} to determine the role that they played, because plant foods were often eaten raw or were simply boiled, without requiring special equipment for preparation, and thus barely leaving any trace other than the type of food itself. Vegetables also are not mentioned often in the written record, and when the Bible does mention them, the attitude is mixed: sometimes they are regarded as a delicacy, but more often, they were held in low esteem (for example, ( [...] , [...] ). Vegetables were perhaps a more important food at the extremes in society: the wealthy who could afford to dedicate land and resources to <b>grow</b> <b>them,</b> and the poor who depended on gathering them in the wild to supplement their meager supplies.

2500|$|As garden trees, {{they have}} some drawbacks, in {{particular}} the falling nuts, and the releasing of the allelopathic compound juglone, though a number of gardeners do <b>grow</b> <b>them.</b> However, different walnut species vary {{in the amount of}} juglone they release from the roots and fallen leaves - J.nigra, in particular, is known for its toxicity, both to plants and horses. Juglone is toxic to plants such as tomato, apple, and birch, and may cause stunting and death of nearby vegetation. [...] Juglone appears {{to be one of the}} walnut's primary defence mechanisms against potential competitors for resources (water, nutrients and sunlight), and its effects are felt most strongly inside the tree's [...] "drip line" [...] (the circle around the tree marked by the horizontal distance of its outermost branches). However, even plants at a seemingly great distance outside the drip line can be affected, and juglone can linger in the soil for several years even after a walnut is removed as its roots slowly decompose and release juglone into the soil.|$|E

2500|$|... 1,000 {{years before}} [...] "the Age of Arthur" [...] (approximately 1,033 {{years before the}} Present Day), Merlin and a friend, Adda, were deserters from an army and were {{trekking}} through a desert, desperate for water. Merlin saw a light and ran after it, revealed to be the Holy Grail, {{on top of a}} stone. Thinking that it was sacred, Merlin initially refuses to touch it, but his friend, Abbas, disregards his warnings and decides to drink from it anyway. When his friend grabbed it, he turned to ashes. Merlin then grabbed the grail after praying to God for permission, and was able to drink from it. When he put his hand down, he realized he had magic. The desert was no more — only lush greenery and forests. 500 years later, Merlin is at a village healing people, where his apprentice informs him of a woman who escaped a burning village. Merlin meets the woman, who introduces herself as Nimue. She wants revenge on Vortigan, the masked man responsible. She also had Middlemist flowers to offer, as their survival will guarantee a form of revenge. Merlin agrees to help her and places the seeds in a planter, and he uses his magic to <b>grow</b> <b>them</b> instantly. Over {{the course of the next}} several months, they fall in love, and Merlin reveals the truth about the Grail and how he acquired magic. He expresses a wish to reforge the grail into a sword that can destroy his immortality, so that he can live a normal mortal life with Nimue as his wife.
