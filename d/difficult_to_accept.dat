5|$|Derrick did {{not join}} up when war broke out in September 1939 but, like many Australians, enlisted {{after the fall of}} France in June 1940. He joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 5 July 1940, and was posted to the 2/48th Battalion, 26th Brigade, as a private. Derrick first joined his unit at the Wayville Showgrounds, before basic {{training}} at Woodside. Derrick thrived on military life, but found discipline <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Mussolini {{had made}} clear in 1922 {{that he would}} never give up the region of South Tyrol from being in Italy, Hitler adopted this position. Hitler in Mein Kampf had {{declared}} that concerns over the rights of Germans in South Tyrol under Italian sovereignty was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German-Italian alliance with Mussolini's Fascist regime. In Mein Kampf Hitler also made clear that he was opposed to having a war with Italy for the sake of obtaining South Tyrol. This position by Hitler of abandoning German land claims to South Tyrol produced aggravation among some NSDAP members who up to the late 1920s found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the position.|$|E
5|$|One of the Prussian playing-for-time {{requests}} to the Patriotic Party was {{that before the}} treaty is signed, {{they need to see}} more reforms within the Commonwealth government. In October 1789, the changing international situation (primarily the military defeats of the Ottoman Empire) suddenly and temporarily increased the value of an alliance with Poland for Prussia. In the meantime, the previously anti-royalist Patriotic Party has begun drifting closer to the king. In February and March 1790, concrete proposals were exchanged between Warsaw and Berlin. Some difficulties were centered around Prussian demands for the cession of Gdańsk and Toruń, and tariffs, but a threat of a Polish-Austrian alliance, recently brought forward by Austria, caused Prussia to withdraw most of the demands the Polish side was finding <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Fifteenth Gymnasium (XV. gimnazija, Petnaesta gimnazija), {{previously}} called, {{and still}} {{better known as}} MIOC, is {{a public high school}} in Zagreb, Croatia. It specializes in mathematics and computer science and it is considered to be the best high school in the capital along with Fifth Gymnasium (V. gimnazija). Therefore, in the previous years, it has been increasingly more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> be <b>accepted</b> <b>to</b> the school.|$|R
5000|$|The tactic {{is closely}} {{identified}} with Michel Pablo and Gerry Healy, who were {{leaders of the}} Fourth International in the late 1940s and 1950s. The [...] "deep entry" [...] tactic was developed {{as a way for}} Trotskyists to respond to the Cold War. In countries where there were mass social democratic or communist parties, it was as <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> be <b>accepted</b> into these parties as Trotskyist currents as to build separate Trotskyist parties. Therefore, Trotskyists were advised to join the mass party.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 70 {{students}} were <b>accepted</b> <b>to</b> the veterinary medicine courses each year at NVH. The {{program was a}} 5.5 to 6-year professional degree/ Master program leading to the title cand.med.vet.

5|$|The {{indigenous}} rodents of Madagascar, the Nesomyinae, {{prior to}} the discovery of Monticolomys comprised seven very distinctive genera—so distinct from each other that some have found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> that they are closely related. Monticolomys, however, does not follow this pattern, in that it is similar and closely related to the gerbil-like genus Macrotarsomys of western Madagascar. This relationship was originally proposed by Goodman and Carleton based on morphology, and was strongly supported by a DNA sequence analysis (based on the cytochrome b gene) published in 1999. While this study provided some weak support for a relationship between the Macrotarsomys–Monticolomys clade and the giant jumping rat, Hypogeomys, a later study based on the IRBP gene instead placed Macrotarsomys–Monticolomys sister to a clade containing four other nesomyine genera—Eliurus, Voalavo, Gymnuromys, and Brachytarsomys.|$|E

25|$|Development {{from these}} {{engineering}} samples to real-world products {{was going to}} be long and expensive. Although the battery line continued to do well, the profits it generated were not enough to run the company as a whole. Ballard started looking for new capital, and found Mike Brown, a founder of the Vancouver-based Ventures West venture capital company. Ventures West provided several rounds of funding, and Brown suggested that if the company wanted to be successful it was going to need new leadership who was familiar with dealing with large companies. Although the founders found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> a stranger into their midst, they were eventually won over and Firoz Rasul became the new CEO. Rasul immediately instituted a development plan with a timeline of goals that had to be met and go/no-go milestones.|$|E

Despite the professional success she accepted her gender dysphoria and realized she would need {{to move away from}} engineering (where it would have been <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> be <b>accepted</b> in a new gender). Her own gender transition started in 1993 and took many years. In 1997 she had sex reassignment surgery with a reputed Brazilian surgeon named Jalma Jurado.|$|R

25|$|Mark Albert Fowler is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Mark, an original regular character when the series started in February 1985, became a semi-regular after his original portrayer David Scarboro was written out of the role in April 1985. Scarboro made brief returns to the role in 1986 and 1987. Scarboro died by suicide in April 1988, and the role was recast in 1990, with Todd Carty taking on the role. From this point the character was a permanent fixture in the series and Carty remained in the role until the character was written out of the series in early 2003. Initially a delinquent teenager, he became a changed man when he was 22. His contracting HIV forced him to grow up fast and accept his responsibilities. He frequently found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the restrictions of the illness, which finally claimed his life in April 2004.|$|E
500|$|Trautmann {{found it}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> criticism, and allowed only close friends to suggest changes to his game. He {{occasionally}} dwelt on mistakes {{to the detriment}} of his concentration, a tendency his friend Stan Wilson called [...] "picking at daisies". A short temper also caused occasional problems; he was sent off on more than one occasion.|$|E
500|$|Some critics find it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> Fodor's {{insistence that}} a large, perhaps implausible, number of {{concepts}} are primitive and undefinable. For example, Fodor considers such concepts as EFFECT, ISLAND, TRAPEZOID, and WEEK {{to be all}} primitive, innate and unanalyzable because they all fall {{into the category of}} what he calls [...] "lexical concepts" [...] (those for which our language has a single word). Against this view, Bach argues that the concept VIXEN is almost certainly composed out of the concepts FEMALE and FOX, BACHELOR out of SINGLE and MALE, and so on.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the natives}} it was [...] not <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} or <b>accept</b> {{the existence of}} the Holy Trinity because for them, the creators of this world were three, known by Mayan scholars as [...] "G1", [...] "G2" [...] and [...] "G3"; neither was to assimilate Virgin Mary, because they associated her with Ixchel -the moon, creative life- mother.|$|R
25|$|The Emperor's {{opinion was}} that the gap in opinion could most likely be bridged. An initial set of demands was drafted during the Council meeting. Over the next few days, the demands were reinforced, {{possibly}} {{with the help of}} the German Foreign Office to make sure there was a war, and made more iron-clad and <b>difficult</b> for Serbia <b>to</b> <b>accept.</b>|$|R

500|$|After {{a period}} of legal {{troubles}} which prohibited the band from using its own name on recordings, Black Flag returned to the studio with {{a new approach to}} its music that incorporated a greater variety of styles, resulting in a sound orthodox punks found <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept.</b> [...] The line-up had shrunk from five members to three: vocalist Henry Rollins, drummer Bill Stevenson, and co-founding guitarist Greg Ginn. [...] Ginn doubled on bass guitar under the name [...] "Dale Nixon" [...] for the recording as he had pushed out co-founding bassist Chuck Dukowski shortly before recording; the album includes two tracks Dukowski wrote.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{considerable}} influence of Forerunner, naturalists such as Martin Lister (1638–1712) and John Ray (1627–1705) continued {{to question the}} organic origin of some fossils. They were particularly concerned about objects such as fossil Ammonites, which Hooke claimed were organic in origin, that did not resemble any known living species. This {{raised the possibility of}} extinction, which they found <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> for philosophical and theological reasons. In 1695 Ray wrote to the Welsh naturalist Edward Lluyd complaining of such views: [...] "... there follows such a train of consequences, as seem to shock the Scripture-History of the novity of the World; at least they overthrow the opinion received, & not without good reason, among Divines and Philosophers, that since the first Creation there have been no species of Animals or Vegetables lost, no new ones produced." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in Conflict Quarterly for The Journal of Conflict Studies, David Charters {{questioned}} why {{the book}} did not present {{more of an}} analysis on the aggregate impact {{of all of the}} disinformation campaigns, before noting such a task would be difficult to assess. The reviewer asked why the book did not fully address questions including, [...] "Did any of the forgeries described have a significant political impact on the intended target, and on U.S. relations with the country concerned, or were they merely of nuisance value?" [...] Conflict Quarterly criticized such absence in the book and identified it as an academic deficiency, writing, [...] "Without answers to questions such as these, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept,</b> at face value, the authors' conclusions." [...] Charters concluded the book was [...] "a useful introduction to a field of knowledge which... is likely to continue to expand in importance for diplomats, the intelligence community, and scholars of international security affairs.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} dogfight over England on 24 August 1940, Marseille was {{involved}} in a four-minute battle with a skilled opponent. He defeated his opponent by pulling up into a tight chandelle, to gain an altitude advantage before diving and firing. The British fighter was struck in the engine, pitching over and diving into the English Channel; this was Marseille's first victory. Marseille was then engaged from above by more Allied fighters. By pushing his aircraft into a steep dive then pulling up metres above the water, Marseille escaped from the machine gun fire of his opponents: [...] "skipping away over the waves, I made a clean break. No one followed me and I returned to Leeuwarden [...]" [...] The act was not praised by his unit. Marseille was reprimanded when it emerged he had abandoned his wingman, and staffel to engage the opponent alone. In so doing, Marseille had violated a basic rule of air combat. Marseille did not take any pleasure in this victory and found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the realities of aerial combat.|$|E
500|$|Killebrew {{was first}} {{eligible}} for the Hall of Fame in 1981 and received 239 votes, or 59.6% of the vote; 75% of the vote is required for induction. While he did hit 573 home runs (5th all-time {{when he left the}} game), he amassed a relatively low hit total (2086), given the years he played, combined with a high number of strikeouts (1699), and a [...]256 batting average. In 1982, Killebrew received 59.3% of the vote, taking a backseat to Hank Aaron and Frank Robinson, who made it in their first year of eligibility. After receiving 71.9% of the vote in 1983, Killebrew said that not getting in that year was more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> than the previous two times, and asked [...] "Why do the writers feel there only has to be a certain number inducted each time?" [...] In 1984, Killebrew received 83.1% of the vote and was elected to the Hall in his fourth year of eligibility, joining Luis Aparicio and Don Drysdale as electees.|$|E
500|$|Miller and Hordern's {{collaboration}} {{continued into}} 1969 with King Lear at the Nottingham Playhouse. Hordern immediately accepted {{the title role}} but later {{said that it was}} a character he never much cared to play. Writing about Miller in his autobiography, Hordern stated: [...] "It {{was one of the most}} exhilarating and funny experiences I have had in the theatre." [...] Miller recruited Frank Middlemass to play the fool, but contrary to tradition, Miller made the character an intimate of Lear's as opposed to a servant, something which Shakespearean purists found <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept.</b> Miller decided to further defy convention by concentrating on the relationships between the characters rather than adding detail to scenery and costume; he was eager not to use lavish sets and lighting for the fear of detracting from the characterisations and the sentimentality of the storyline. As such, the sets were bleak and the costumes more so; it was a style that was also used when the play was televised by the BBC later that decade.|$|E
50|$|Most eosimiid {{species are}} {{documented}} by unique or fragmentary specimens.

500|$|The Court voted 8-1 {{to reverse}} the Illinois Appellate Court to hold {{the actions of the}} police {{officers}} at question constitutional. Justice Breyer wrote the majority opinion which upheld the search. Due to the specific circumstances of the case, the police needed to prevent the investigation scene from being contaminated. Breyer wrote that the Court found [...] "no case in which [...] held unlawful a temporary seizure that was supported by probable cause and was designed to prevent the loss of evidence while the police diligently obtained a warrant in a reasonable period of time." [...] Moreover, McArthur's argument that his decision to remain on his porch and not allow the police entry did not amount to [...] "a constructive eviction". Instead, Breyer noted that the Court found in a prior case that the doorway of a house is in a 'public place' and thus not subject to warrant rules. He noted in conclusion that the hard-to-contest fact of probable cause made it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> McArthur's claims.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green, {{reviewing}} the episode for TrekNation was undecided {{about whether the}} main point of the episode where Captain Archer is expected to lead the Vulcans back to their main path of logic was a [...] "wonderfully progressive concept or just regressive Trek in which humans have all the answers". She thought that the change in Soval's opinions in this episode was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> and that {{the other members of}} the main cast didn't get a great deal to do in the episode. However, whilst she thought that [...] "Awakening" [...] was a visual improvement over [...] "The Forge", she was reserving judgement until she had seen the third part of the trilogy. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] thought that certain elements of the plot didn't follow logical paths, such as how Archer found the Kir'shara in a few minutes when apparently the Syrrannites had been looking for it for two years even though [...] "it sits in a chamber behind a door that practically announces, 'IMPORTANT RELIC INSIDE'?" [...] However, he called the episode entertaining and gave it a score of three out of four.|$|E

[...] The move [...] "hurt" [...] and [...] "bothered" [...] Cal Jr., but he worked through it and remained with the team for 13 more seasons, the rest of his career. Billy switched his number from 3 to 7, saying, [...] "I just didn't want to see anybody else wear it." [...] After Hall of Famer Frank Robinson replaced Ripken, the Orioles proceeded to lose 15 more consecutive games to set the record for the longest losing streak to start a season.
