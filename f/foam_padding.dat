40|$|A simple {{alternative}} {{technique has}} been devised protecting delicate equipment against electrostatic discharge (ESD) in settings in which workers wear communication headsets. In the original {{setting in which}} the technique was devised, the workers who wear the headsets also wear anti-ESD grounding straps on their wrists. The alternative technique {{eliminates the need for}} the wrist grounding straps by providing for grounding through the headsets. In place of the electrically insulating <b>foam</b> <b>pads</b> on the headsets, one installs pads made of electrically conductive foam like that commonly used to protect electronic components. Grounding wires are attached to the conductive <b>foam</b> <b>pads,</b> then possibly to the shielding cable which may be grounded to the backshell on the connector. The efficacy of this technique in protecting against ESD has been verified in experiments. The electrical resistance of the pads is a few megohms - about {{the same as that of}} a human body between the fingers of opposite hands and, hence, low enough for grounding. The only drawback of the technique is that care must be taken to place the <b>foam</b> <b>pads</b> in contact with the user s skin: any hair that comes between the <b>foam</b> <b>pads</b> and the skin must be pushed aside because hair is electrically insulating and thus prevents adequate grounding...|$|R

[...] Pseudomonas can, in rare circumstances, cause community-acquired pneumonias, as well as ventilator-associated pneumonias, being one of the most common agents isolated in several studies.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} postural {{control and}} performance in subjects with Down syndrome (SwDS), we measured postural sway (COP) in quiet stance in four 20 -second tests: with eyes open or closed and on hard or foam surface. Ten SwDS and eleven healthy subjects participated, aged 29. 8 (4. 8) and 28. 4 (3. 9), respectively. The time-series recorded with the sampling rate of 100 Hz were used to evaluate postural performance (COP amplitude and mean velocity) and strategies (COP frequency, fractal dimension and entropy). There were no intergroup differences in the amplitude except the stance on <b>foam</b> <b>pad</b> with eyes open when SwDS had larger sway. The COP velocity and frequency were larger in SwDS than controls in all trials on <b>foam</b> <b>pad.</b> During stances on the <b>foam</b> <b>pad</b> SwDS increased fractal dimension showing higher complexity of their equilibrium system, while controls decreased sample entropy exhibiting more conscious control of posture {{in comparison to the}} stances on hard support surface. This indicated that each group used entirely different adjustments of postural strategies to the somatosensory challenge. It is proposed that the inferior postural control of SwDS results mainly from insufficient experience in dealing with unpredictable postural stimuli and deficit in motor learning...|$|R

Balance training has become common in therapeutic exercise routines for rehabilitation, injury prevention, and fall prevention. Unstable surfaces such as <b>foam</b> <b>pads</b> are commonly used in these purportedly to improve balance.

Unstable surfaces such as <b>foam</b> <b>pads</b> are commonly used in these purportedly to improve balance. While postural sway is often used as a measure of balance ability and to evaluate the efficacy of such programs to improve postural balance, there is little research regarding the measurement of sway while standing on <b>foam</b> <b>pads.</b> PURPOSE: To compare measures of postural sway from a clinical balance platform against a mobile application. METHODS: Two devices were used to obtain the postural dynamics of static balance for each subject: 1) a balance platform (Biodex Balance System SD) and 2) a mobile application (SWAY Balance) that utilizes the built-in tri-axial accelerometer within an iPhone or iPod Touch to measure balance. The mobile device is held against the chest so data collection on both devices can be collected simultaneously. 57 participants (28 male; 29 female) aged 24. 3 ± 6. 8 yr completed the study in which they stood bilaterally and then unilaterally on a firm surface and then on <b>foam</b> <b>pads</b> using both devices to evaluate postural sway. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences between}} the two devices as measured on the firm surface. However, there was a difference (p< 0. 05) when standing on foam (balance platform = 3. 775; mobile application = 5. 659) between the two devices. Unilateral stance on foam (9. 887) was higher (p< 0. 05) than unilateral stance on the solid surface (4. 862) with only the mobile application. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, the mobile application is a valid and useful clinical tool for the evaluation of balance as results did not differ with the balance platform when measuring balance on the stable surface. However, given that postural sway did not differ between unilateral stance on firm versus foam surfaces with the balance platform, it appears that the balance platform strain gauges do not effectively measure sway while standing on foam. Therefore, this mobile application may be a better tool for quantification of sway while standing on foam...|$|R
