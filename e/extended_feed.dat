40|$|The {{commercialization of}} animal feeds {{infected}} by prions {{proved to be}} the main cause of transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Therefore, feed bans were enforced, initially for ruminant feeds, and later for all feeds for farmed animals. The development and validation of analytical methods for the species-specific detection of animal proteins in animal feed has been indicated in the TSE (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies) Roadmap (European Commission. The TSE (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy) roadmap. URL: [URL] 2005) as the main condition for lifting the <b>extended</b> <b>feed</b> ban. Methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) seem to be a promising solution for this aim. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the applicability of four different real-time PCR methods, developed by three National expert laboratories from the European Union (EU), for the detection and identification of cattle or ruminant species in typical compound feeds, fortified with meat and bone meals (MBM) from different animal species at different concentration levels. The MBM samples utilized in this study have been treated using the sterilization condition mandatory within the European Union (steam pressure sterilization at 133 °C, 3 bar, and 20 min), which is an additional challenge to the PCR methods evaluated in this study. The results indicate that the three labs applying their PCR methods were able to detect 0. 1 % of cattle MBM, either alone or in mixtures with different materials such as fishmeal, which demonstrates the improvement made by this technique, especially when compared with results from former interlaboratory studies. © 2007 American Chemical Society...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Parental {{decision-making}} around <b>extended</b> formula <b>feeding</b> (12 months+) has {{not been}} explored previously. This study tested the hypotheses that extended formula milk use (i) is associated with poorer appetite and (ii) supplements lower food intake. METHODS: Appetite was assessed with the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) in 3854 twin children aged 16 months. Diet was assessed from 3 -day diaries in 2714 children at 21 months. Parents reported their children's weight at 24 months. Associations between formula feeding and (1) appetite, (2) energy intake and (3) weight were examined. 35 mothers were interviewed when the children were 7 years old to explore retrospectively their reasons for <b>extended</b> formula <b>feeding.</b> RESULTS: Formula consumers (13 % of the sample) scored significantly differently than non-formula consumers on {{five of the six}} CEBQ subscales, indicating lower appetite avidity: 'food responsiveness' (2. 02 vs 2. 22, respectively),'enjoyment of food' (3. 99 vs 4. 20), 'satiety responsiveness' (2. 89 vs 2. 65), 'slowness in eating' (2. 63 vs 2. 46) and 'food fussiness' (2. 34 vs 2. 14). Formula consumers had a significantly lower percentage of daily energy intake from food (70 % vs 74 %); however, total daily energy intake did not differ significantly from non-consumers (4315 vs 4373 kJ). At interview, mothers reported supplementing their child's diet with formula because of 'picky eating' and concerns about inadequate food intake. CONCLUSIONS: High formula milk intake is associated with picky-eating behaviours, but seems to act as a substitute for rather than a supplement to solid food. Prospective and intervention studies are needed to determine whether <b>extended</b> formula <b>feeding</b> has an enduring impact on weight trajectories, eating behaviours or health...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine if adding supplemental cholesterol to the feed or first adding it to the supplemental fat source of laying hen diets would result in differences in egg yolk and liver cholesterol levels. Five levels of cholesterol (0,. 5, 1, 2, and 4 %) and three levels of animal tallow (0, 4, and 8 %) were used. The diets were randomly assigned and fed for 35 days to individually caged hens within each of six replicates. Eggs laid on or near Days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 were used for cholesterol analysis. Liver cholesterol, egg production, and feed intake were also assessed. Mixing cholesterol with the fat source before feed incorporation did not promote higher yolk or liver cholesterol levels and were {{essentially the same as}} the method in which powdered cholesterol was added directly to the feed. A linear increase in yolk and liver cholesterol was observed with 0,. 5, and 1 % dietary cholesterol. Yolk cholesterol also increased linearly during the first 14 days of cholesterol administration.

40|$|The {{survival}} of sea turtles {{is threatened by}} modern fishing methods, exploitation of eggs and habitat destruction. Forming keystone species in the ocean, their extinction would disrupt the marine food chain in ways as yet unknown. The Indian Ocean has many breeding areas for sea turtles, the southernmost ones being on the Maputaland coast of KwaZulu-Natal, where loggerhead and leatherback turtles nest in large numbers thanks to long-lasting protection programmes. For the leatherback {{this is the only}} known nesting site in the entire western Indian Ocean. At the end of the reproductive season, both loggerheads and leatherbacks under- take migrations towards disparate feeding areas. To contribute to their conservation, the migratory behaviour of these animals needs to be understood. Here we review 10 years studying this behaviour using transmitters that telemeter data via satellite. It emerges that these species frequent widely dispersed areas ranging from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mozambique Channel. The migratory behaviour of leatherback and loggerhead turtles is, however, very different, probably due to their differing food requirements. While loggerhead postnesting movements have a truly migratory nature, the large-scale wanderings of leatherbacks are better described as prolonged sojourns in <b>extended</b> <b>feeding</b> areas...|$|R

40|$|A method {{based on}} fluorescent-antibody {{labelled}} bacteria (FALB) {{was developed to}} demonstrate the presence of ingested bacteria in the food vacuoles of heterotrophic nanoflagellates. Individual bacterial cells are identified in the food vacuoles by immunofluorescence labelling using strain-specific antibodies after uptake of the live cells. The procedure includes permeabilization of fixed flagellate cells prior to the immunoreaction. The uptake of Pseudomonas fluorescens (strain ON 2 and Ag 1) and P. putida (strain MM 1) by Spumella sp., Bodo saltans and 2 unidentified heterotrophic nanoflagellate species was tested. The ingested bacteria were visualized in the food vacuoles by epifluorescence and laser confocal scanning microscopy. The ability of the polyclonal antibodies to recognize the target bacteria was good and very few cross-reactions with other bacteria or other organic compounds were observed.

Moreover, low-density diets may promote satiety through a more filled gastrointestinal tract, and thus feelings of hunger may be reduced. Broiler breeders were fed 4 different diets during the rearing and laying periods. Behavioral and physiological parameters were measured at different ages as indicators of hunger and frustration of the feeding motivation. A diet of 8. 4 MJ/kg as compared with a standard diet of 10. 9 MJ/kg <b>extended</b> <b>feeding</b> time and reduced stereotypic object pecking at 6 and 10 wk of age.

This result could have been due to the very long feeding time of this treatment group during lay, which may be stressful.

40|$|The ice gouged, shallow, polar seabed is a {{challenging}} place to live, but suspension feeders are particularly rich and abundant there. The extreme seasonality of food supply from phytoplankton at high latitudes, combined with very stable temperatures has not, however, reduced {{the range of}} life history adaptations. Some species <b>extend</b> <b>feeding</b> and growing periods by concentrating on smaller, lower biomass but longer duration, fractions of phytoplankton. Here we show that shallow-water Antarctic brachiopods can switch from pelagic to benthic food sources when required. Like most suspension feeders they utilise the extremely abundant summer phytoplankton blooms, but unlike many other groups brachiopods {{do not appear to}} become dormant in winter. In shallow sites around the world wind and wave action resuspend benthic material, making it available to filter feeders. Widespread ice disturbance at polar latitudes may also cause resuspension enhancing local food supply. Articulate brachiopods have blind-ended guts and probably feed little once a large bolus of food has been collected, so a resuspension event may represent a significant enhancement of yearly food availability. The key to their ability to utilise unpredictable food sources is the same trait responsible for their polar success; very low maintenance costs and a catholic diet. Utilising resuspended material could be an important factor in global brachiopod distributions. Previously difficult to explain high brachiopod densities in New Zealand, Northwest Europe and the Canadian Pacific Coast may occur because these areas are all in the worldrsquos windiest, and hence strongest resuspension, latitudes...|$|R
