I mean, what is color? Painting {{has to do with}} a lot of things. Color is among the things <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with.</b> <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> surface. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> shape, <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> feelings which are more difficult to get at.|$|E

As the population grows, it's important to plan for viable alternative transportation options, such as simply walking or biking to the grocery store or to work.|$|E

25|$|A {{common cause}} of cradle cap {{appears to be a}} common manifestation of biotin insufficiency. This may be due, in part, to the {{influence}} of biotin on fatty acid biosynthesis. Possibly <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> overactive sebaceous glands in the skin of newborn babies, due to the mother's hormones still in the baby's circulation. The glands release a greasy substance that makes old skin cells attach to the scalp instead of falling off as they dry. There may be a relationship with skin yeasts (Pityrosporum ovale, newly renamed Malassezia furfur). Seborrheic dermatitis is the adult version of cradle cap.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth Cole tells Hastings {{that she}} is a sister of Margaret Litchfield, who confessed to the murder of their father in one of the five cases. Margaret has died in Broadmoor Asylum and Elizabeth is stigmatised by the trauma. Three {{incidents}} occur in the next few days, showing the imprint of X. First, Hastings and others overhear an argument between the Luttrells. Shortly afterwards, Luttrell wounds his wife with a rook rifle, saying he mistook her for a rabbit. Mrs Luttrell recovers, and the incident has a good effect on their marriage. Next, Hastings is concerned that his daughter Judith spends time with Major Allerton, a married man. While Hastings and Elizabeth are out with birdwatcher Stephen Norton, Norton sees something through his binoculars that disturbs him. Hastings assumes <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Allerton. When his attempts to persuade Judith to give Allerton up merely antagonise her, the worried father plans Allerton's murder. He falls asleep while waiting to poison Allerton, relieved he took no action when he awakes the next day. Last, Barbara Franklin, wife of Judith's employer Dr Franklin, dies the following evening. She was poisoned with physostigmine sulphate, an extract from the Calabar bean that her husband researches. Poirot's testimony at the inquest, that Mrs Franklin had been upset and that he saw her emerge from Dr Franklin's laboratory with a small bottle, persuades the jury to return a verdict of suicide.|$|E

[...] "While [...] "Civil War II" [...] may have initiated this rift, we've {{known for some}} time that Kamala would eventually need to separate herself from her idols. Her journey centers around self-discovery and identity, and a part of that exploration includes separating yourself from those you put on pedestals. The rift between Carol and Kamala doesn't really have to do with right and wrong. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> growing up and realizing that you perceive the world differently from even the ones you love," [...] Amanat elaborated.|$|E
500|$|... "Luxurious" [...] is an R ballad, whose {{instrumentation}} {{consists of}} keyboards and synthesizers. It {{is written in}} common time in the key of A minor. The song uses a descending i-vii-VI-V chord progression. The lyrics of the song include descriptions of wealth and riches, what one reviewer called [...] "a world of Egyptian cotton, cashmere, tuberoses, and, of course, diamonds". Stefani stated that [...] " [...] song really is more about a love relationship. If you really listen to the lyrics, {{it has nothing to}} do with money or luxury. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> love, being rich in love. I just wanted to think of a clever way to express how you have to work really hard for the rewards of that." [...] The single version of the song contains an additional verse from rapper Slim Thug for release to urban radio and clubs.|$|E
500|$|Karen Allen, who {{previously}} appeared in Raiders of the Lost Ark, reprises {{the role of}} Marion Ravenwood (under the married name of Marion Williams). Frank Darabont's script introduced the idea of Marion returning as Indiana's love interest. Allen was not aware her character was in the script until Spielberg called her in January 2007, saying, [...] "It's been announced! We're gonna make Indiana Jones 4! And guess what? You're in it!" [...] Ford found Allen [...] "one of the easiest people to work with [...] ever known. She's a completely self-sufficient woman, and that's part of the character she plays. A lot of her charm and the charm of the character is there. And again, it's not an age-dependent thing. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> her spirit and her nature." [...] Allen found Ford easier to work with on this film, than in Raiders.|$|E

500|$|In Only You, Dick Daring!, his humorous yet damning {{account of}} the {{five and a half}} months he spent trying to make a show with CBS for the 1963–64 season based on an idea of Aubrey's about a county agent, writer Merle Miller {{described}} how Aubrey would simply walk out of meetings without offering any substantive comments on Miller's program and the nineteen rewrites he did of the pilot episode. Miller was assured by other CBS executives that Aubrey's silence meant things were fine– Kempton quoted a CBS producer telling Miller [...] "this {{has nothing to do with}} a good script or a bad script. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> pleasing one man, Jim Aubrey. Don't ever forget it"– and Miller later learned of efforts by Aubrey to force him out. (A pilot for the show, known as Calhoun and County Agent, to star Jackie Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck, was shot and put on the fall schedule, but the series was canceled before it ever aired.) Miller quoted an independent producer: [...] "Aubrey's the most important man in television, in the history of television, maybe in the history of entertainment. He out-Mayers Louis B. Mayer ten times over." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Book Job" [...] has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology named it one the season's strongest episodes so far, praising it for featuring [...] "a brilliant appearance by author [...] Neil Gaiman and a slick Ocean's Eleven aesthetic". AOL TV's Jason Hughes applauded the uncommon structuring of the episode, writing: [...] "So {{why was this}} episode so much more fun than usual? We think <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the format and the playfulness in the presentation. After two decades, it pays {{to shake things up}} and give us a completely fresh look at the show. Even the team created some new combinations from the massive Springfield citizenry. Maybe they should consider doing that more often." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "entertaining and successful", commenting that [...] "element of surprise is the key here, and The Simpsons did something quite surprising tonight, combining a parody of heist movies with a sharp satirical look at book mill publishing. With the successful guest appearances by both Neil Gaiman and Andy García, this episode delivered an increasingly rare treat for Simpsons fans: a well-written and well-acted half-hour that gets better and funnier as it goes." [...] Childs did, however, criticize the [...] "split screens of various heist-style shenanigans" [...] as the [...] "least amusing part of the episode." [...] He noted that while [...] "the rest of the gags have some thrust to them, [...] cross the line into cute pandering to the audience. Fortunately, they are over in about ten seconds." ...|$|E

This does not have to do with morality. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> legality. As human beings, we have to protect them as they are. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> civil liberty," [...] said Congresswoman Julieta López, who pushed the bill, from the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), whose 19 members voted for the law. Luis Alberto Mendoza, deputy of the center-right National Action Party (PAN), which opposed the law, said it was an [...] "attack against the family, which is society's natural group and is formed by a man and a woman." [...] Other than that, the PCS drew little opposition. Bishop Raúl Vera, who headed the Catholic Diocese of Saltillo, declined to condemn the law. While Vera insisted that [...] "two women or two men cannot get married," [...] he also saw gay people as a vulnerable minority. [...] "Today we live in a society that is composed in a different way. There are people who do not want to marry under the law or in the church. They need legal protection. I should not abandon these people." [...] Unlike Mexico City's law, once same-sex couples have registered in Coahuila, the state protects their rights no matter where they live in the country. Twenty days after the law had passed, the country's first same-sex civil union took place in Saltillo. It was between 29-year-olds Karina Almaguer and Karla Lopez, a lesbian couple from Tamaulipas. Between 2007 and 2010, 196 same-sex couples had entered into a PCS, none of them had been annulled.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Campbell: Well {{that was}} {{associated}} primarily with agriculture and the agricultural societies. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the earth. The human woman gives birth {{just as the}} earth gives birth to the plants...so woman magic and earth magic are the same. They are related. [...] And the personification of the energy that gives birth to forms and nourishes forms is properly female. It is in the agricultural world of ancient Mesopotamia, the Egyptian Nile, and in the earlier planting-culture systems that the Goddess is the dominant mythic form. Campbell also argues {{that the image of}} the Virgin Mary was derived from the image of Isis and her child Horus: [...] "The antique model for the Madonna, is Isis with Horus at her breast".|$|E

2500|$|Another common term is [...] "Stud". A stud is a {{dominant}} lesbian, usually butch. They {{tend to be}} influenced by urban and hip-hop cultures and are often, but not always, Afro-American. In the New York City lesbian community a butch may identify herself as AG (aggressive) or as a stud. In 2005, filmmaker Daniel Peddle chronicled the lives of AGs in his documentary The Aggressives, following six women who went to lengths like binding their breasts to pass as men. But Peddle says that today, very young lesbians of color in New York are creating a new, insular scene that's largely cut {{off from the rest of}} the gay and lesbian community. [...] "A lot of <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> this kind of pressure to articulate and express your masculinity within the confines of the hip-hop paradigm..."
