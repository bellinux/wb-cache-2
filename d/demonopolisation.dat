40|$|In 1991 Ukraine {{became an}} {{independent}} state, abandoned central planning, {{and started the}} transformation of its economy. The country inherited a highly monopolised structure of economy from the Soviet Union, therefore <b>demonopolisation</b> {{and the development of}} competition have been among the main areas where structural changes were necessary. The present study gives a comprehensive picture of the development of antitrust policy in the Ukraine from 1992 to 2002 through an assessment of evolving competition policy and examination of the policy's implementation. On the one hand, the development of competition policy in the Ukraine included the establishment of rules and appropriate procedures, as well as the creation of a proper institutional framework. On the other hand, the lack of a unified state approach to the reformation of the economy in general and to the problems of the development of competition in particular could be observed. The actions of different state organs were not synchronised, and competition policy in the Ukraine failed to become the main element of the economic policy setup...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{different}} approaches to <b>demonopolisation</b> used in Polish and European urban public transport, compare the efficiency of these models which have proven popular in Poland as well as to estimate the total losses incurred due to the high monopolisation of Polish public transport. The methodology of the research is based on econometric modelling (Stochastic Frontier Analysis) and on a survey conducted by the author among Public Transport Authorities. The author proves that the modern London model (competition for the market) is more efficient in Polish conditions than the classic German one (communal monopoly). The very popular in Poland combination of the two above formulas – the co-existence of a Public Transport Authority with a monopolistic publicly owned operator – is surprisingly the least efficient. Total losses due to the existence of monopolies in Polish urban bus transport are estimated for the year 2007 at the level of 10 - 14 % of its total budget (ca. 117 - 149 m EURO/year). In some cities, the losses can be as high as 20 - 25 % of the total remuneration to the public bus operator. In others, public monopolists can be as efficient as private operators in the competitive model. ...|$|E

The privileges of the alcohol monopoly ‘Systembolaget’ established in 1950 s of twentienth century have been gradually stepped back since Sweden's access to the EU. The author's aim is to verify the thesis of the complementary character of instruments for affecting the alcohol market (i. e. the regulatory and allocation policy) under conditions of {{the internal and external}} pressures on the Swedish monopoly. MethodThe methodology involves a critical study of recent literature works and legal documents as well as an analysis of statistical data. ResultsWhile effectively restricting the physical availability of alcohol, the monopoly succeeded also in shaping social attitudes to alcohol consumption. Regulations of excise duty rates and social campaigns made it possible for ‘Systembolaget’ to promote moderate alcohol consumption and effectively encourage the use of wine instead of other alcohol types. DiscussionThe undertaken analysis opens the way to a discussion on the possible effects of <b>demonopolisation.</b> Along with concerns regarding age limits controls in a free market model, an important argument against the abolition of ‘Systembolaget’ is its potential in meeting consumer expectations and shaping public opinion. ConclusionsThe thesis of the complementary character of alcohol policy instruments can be verified positively.

40|$|The {{public sector}} {{efficiency}} {{can be understood}} as the systematic rational decision about the public policy goals and the arrangements of its obtaining. <b>Demonopolisation</b> of public service production and the alternative service delivering arrangements in public sector can be marked as the one of conditions of such decision. Outsourcing services in public sector with {{is one of the most}} prevalent types of the alternative service delivering arrangements. To put outsourcing in perspective, it is necessary to consider pros and cons of internal and external forms of delivery. Concerning the positive potential of outsourcing, the relevant literature proposes that outsourcing may, but need not, improve individual choice, cost-effectiveness and the quality of delivery, equity and to some extend also expenditure control. On the other hand, many authors provide important arguments describing weak points of outsourcing and some risks connected with outsourcing services in public sector. The main reason, why outsourcing does not produce the expected results and even creates perverse effects in effectiveness and quality of outsourced services, is the improper implementation of contract management. This paper seeks to answer the question what factors account for success in outsourcing services in public sector by developing a explanatory model of outsourcing performance dependent on selected factor connected with contract management such as competition, ex ante evaluation of external supplier, contract monitoring, contract duration, contract payment and test it empirically. This study uses a quantitative approach to investigate the research question and analyze the original collected survey data from own research supported by the Czech Science Foundation GACR under the contract No. P 403 / 10 / 1892 : Optimizing outsourcing in the public sector and by Matej Bel Univerzity Grant Agency under the contract No. UGA I- 11 - 001 - 02...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to check how the {{different}} "starting" level to the market economy in 1990 and a different pace of economic reform introduction affect the level of development and use of communication infrastructure in former European socialist countries in 1999. In their analysis, the Authors have used six variables, as well as multifeature and monofeature classifications, and ranking. Four groups of countries with differentiated level of communication development have been distinguished: Slovenia and Estonia (relatively well developed communication); Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and Bulgaria (distinguished by good accessibility to telephones); Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine (the most visible feature is a low number of telephone connections and a small number of hosts); Albania (with a very low level of communication development). As the result of ranking, the countries have been ordered from the countries that have the best conditions and abilities of their inhabitants' communication to the countries with the weakest conditions. The best situation in this respect is in the wealthy Slovenia, and Estonia that intensively co-operates with the Scandinavian countries. The second group comprises the remaining two of the wealthiest communities in the region: the Czech Republic and Hungary. The worst developed is communication in the countries that quite recently have been inflicted by acts of war, or their governments have not started fast economic reforms (Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Ukraine, Romania, Belarus, Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania). The medium developed countries compose the last group, including Bulgaria, Slovakia, Croatia, Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania. These all countries are the ones that potentially could belong to the first or the second group, with a high level of communication development, but during the last decade a mistake was made somewhere. In Poland, such a mistake is the inconsistent policy of consecutive governments that have not carried out the actual <b>demonopolisation</b> of the market of telephone services and access to Internet.

40|$|In a {{democratic}} society where the individual freedoms of its citizens are ensured {{and the rule of}} law dominates, the media is supposed to be free of government control, and to cover all shades of opinion without fear or hindrance. In such a society, as is prevalent in most countries in Western Europe and in North America, the role of the media in informing, educating, and presenting a platform for all voices in society is crucial to the practice of {{a democratic}} culture. This role exposes the media as a bridge, a liaison between the rulers and the ruled, a carrier of public opinion and a check on the excesses of the rulers. At no time is this role more important than election time, the time when citizens elect those who aspire to rule. More than ever at this time, the media must present the ideas and plans of political candidates in a clear, open, objective and impartial manner, so that the citizens can be sufficiently informed well enough to make firm decisions on who or which party to vote for. This is to ensure that popular participation is not merely reduced to a periodic ritual where the people just line up to vote for particular candidates on a certain day without making their voices heard. In Africa the search for this type of democratic society is in progress after decades of tyrannical rule since independence in the 1950 s and early 1960 s. In such new emerging democracies the media, still mostly owned by the state, and by extension the ruling government, is still trying to free itself from the shackles of governmental control. This has however not been an easy task, as most governments are still not used to the basic freedoms enshrined in their countries newly-promulgated constitutions, particularly with regard to the media and its functions. This study examines the performance of the broadcast media in Ghana s post-independence election campaigns, four of which have been conducted since 1957, from a historical perspective. The study discovers that with the exception of one election campaign period, the state-owned broadcasting system has not been generally fair in its coverage of political contestants, particularly in cases where the incumbent government, or a favourite of the incumbent government, ran for office. Inasmuch as this has been the case, it is hoped that with the establishment of a stronger democratic culture in Africa, the situation will improve with regard to media coverage of political activity. In Ghana in particular the <b>demonopolisation</b> of the airwaves with the establishment of private radio and television stations, with its subsequent market competition with the state-owned stations, is a healthy development that offers hope for the future. It is hoped that the grip of the ruling government on the state-owned stations will be loosened and all voices in the political spectrum can then be heard as mandated by the 1992 Constitutio...|$|E
