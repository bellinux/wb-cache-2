We are currently working on the S-wave velocity inversion (Nagashima et al. 2014) based on the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios of earthquake (EHVRs) motions in and around the DCA through the theory of diffuse fields (Kawase et al. 2011), which will be reported separately. Here we would like to report our preliminary result on the predominant frequency distribution obtained from MHVRs with every 50 - to 100 -m grid covering most of the DCA.

Before calculating the <b>Fourier</b> <b>spectra</b> of observed three component accelerograms, we selected stable parts without strong yet transient noise contributions. The data processing was performed following the standardized procedure (e.g., Mori et al., 2016), in which 40.96 -s record sections were extracted with 50 % overlapping, and <b>Fourier</b> <b>spectra</b> were then obtained with the 0.1  Hz Parzen window for smoothing, and finally, all available spectral ratios of the MHVRs from <b>Fourier</b> <b>spectra</b> were stacked and averaged.|$|R

5000|$|Second-order motion {{has been}} defined as motion in which the moving contour is defined by contrast, , flicker or some other quality that does not result in an {{increase}} in luminance or motion energy in the <b>Fourier</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the stimulus. There is much evidence to suggest that early processing of first- and second-order motion is carried out by separate pathways. Second-order mechanisms have poorer temporal resolution and are low-pass in terms of the range of spatial frequencies to which they respond. (The notion that neural responses are attuned to frequency components of stimulation suffers from the lack of a functional rationale and has been generally criticized by G. Westheimer (2001) in an article called [...] "The Fourier Theory of Vision.") Second-order motion produces a weaker motion aftereffect unless tested with dynamically flickering stimuli.|$|E
50|$|In {{these studies}} De Valois and his {{co-workers}} found support for the conjecture that the early visual system transmits pattern information using a local 2-D spatial frequency or wavelet coding. Among the highlights of this work were that, for neurons in primary visual cortex (V1): i. most have receptive fields corresponding to a limited range of spatial frequencies and orientations; ii. a variety of frequencies and orientations are represented; and iii. responses to some more complex patterns can be predicted by the cell’s spatial frequency tuning and the amplitude of the spatial frequency in the <b>Fourier</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the pattern. As in earlier studies, electrophysiological findings were complemented by monkey and human psychophysics. Well into his 70’s, De Valois continued to pursue the transformations of visual information in LGN and striate cortex. In studies with N. Cottaris and others, De Valois applied reverse correlation techniques to study transformations of spatial, temporal, and chromatic information in LGN and striate cortex.|$|E
50|$|In {{order that}} the {{quasicrystal}} itself be aperiodic, this slice must avoid any lattice plane of the higher-dimensional lattice. De Bruijn showed that Penrose tilings {{can be viewed as}} two-dimensional slices of five-dimensional hypercubic structures. Equivalently, the Fourier transform of such a quasicrystal is nonzero only at a dense set of points spanned by integer multiples of a finite set of basis vectors (the projections of the primitive reciprocal lattice vectors of the higher-dimensional lattice).The intuitive considerations obtained from simple model aperiodic tilings are formally expressed in the concepts of Meyer and Delone sets. The mathematical counterpart of physical diffraction is the Fourier transform and the qualitative description of a diffraction picture as 'clear cut' or 'sharp' means that singularities are present in the <b>Fourier</b> <b>spectrum.</b> There are different methods to construct model quasicrystals. These are the same methods that produce aperiodic tilings with the additional constraint for the diffractive property. Thus, for a substitution tiling the eigenvalues of the substitution matrix should be Pisot numbers. The aperiodic structures obtained by the cut-and-project method are made diffractive by choosing a suitable orientation for the construction; this is a geometric approach that has also a great appeal for physicists.|$|E

The Cooper-Frye prescription is used to determine the final particle distribution. We present the two-particle correlation functions and their <b>Fourier</b> <b>spectra</b> obtained for different viscosities and different initial widths of the perturbation.

50|$|The {{measurement}} of 1/f noise spectrum in voltage or current {{is done in}} the same way as the {{measurement of}} other types of noises. Sampling spectrum analyzers take a finite-time sample from the noise and calculate the Fourier transform by FFT algorithm. Then, after calculating the squared absolute value of the <b>Fourier</b> <b>spectrum,</b> they calculate its average value by repeating this sampling process by a sufficiently large number of times. The resulting pattern is proportional to the power-density spectrum of the measured noise. It is then normalized by the duration of the finite-time sample and also by a numerical constant in the order of 1 to get its exact value. This procedure gives correct spectral data only deeply within the frequency window determined by the reciprocal of the duration of the finite-time sample (low-frequency end) and the digital sampling rate of the noise (high-frequency end). Thus the upper and the lower half decades of the obtained power density spectrum are usually discarded from the spectrum. Conventional spectrum analyzers that sweep a narrow filtered band over the signal have good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), since they are narrow-band instruments. Unfortunately, these instruments do not operate at frequencies low enough to fully measure flicker noise. Sampling instruments are broadband, and hence high noise. They reduce the noise by taking multiple sample traces and averaging them. Conventional spectrum analyzers still have better SNR due to their narrow-band acquisition.|$|E

40|$|We compare <b>Fourier</b> <b>spectra</b> of photospheric {{velocity}} fields {{from very}} high resolution IMaX observations to those from recent 3 D numerical magnetoconvection models. We {{carry out a}} proper comparison by synthesizing spectral lines from the numerical models and then applying to them the adequate residual instrumental degradation that affects the observational data. Also, {{the validity of the}} usual observational proxies is tested by obtaining synthetic observations from the numerical boxes and comparing the velocity proxies to the actual velocity values from the numerical grid. For the observations, data from the SUNRISE/IMaX instrument with about 120 km spatial resolution are used, thus allowing the calculation of observational <b>Fourier</b> <b>spectra</b> well into the subgranular range. For the simulations, we use four series of runs obtained with the STAGGER code and synthesize the IMaX spectral line (FeI 5250. 2 A) from them. Proxies for the velocity field are obtained via Dopplergrams (vertical component) and local correlation tracking (horizontal component). A very good match between observational and simulated <b>Fourier</b> power <b>spectra</b> is obtained for the vertical velocity data for scales between 200 km and 6 Mm. Instead, a clear vertical shift is obtained when the synthetic observations are not degraded. The match for the horizontal velocity data is much less impressive because of the inaccuracies of the LCT procedure. Concerning the internal comparison of the direct velocity values of the numerical boxes with those from the synthetic observations, a high correlation (0. 96) is obtained for the vertical component when using the velocity values on the log($tau_{ 500 }$) = - 1 surface in the box. The corresponding <b>Fourier</b> <b>spectra</b> are near each other.
