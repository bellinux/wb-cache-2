5|$|Chess is a two-player {{board game}} {{utilizing}} a chessboard and sixteen pieces of six types for each player. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The {{goal of the}} game is to checkmate (threaten with unescapable capture) the opponent's king. Games do not necessarily end with checkmate; players often resign <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> they will lose. A game can also end in a draw in several ways.|$|E
5|$|The story I {{am going}} to tell is a horrible one: I beg that daughters and fathers should hold {{themselves}} aloof, while I sing, or if they find my songs enchanting, let them refuse to believe this part of my tale, and suppose that it never happened: or else, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that it did happen, they must believe also in the punishment that followed.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} are {{at about}} twice {{the risk of being}} involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus {{in many areas of the}} world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> the individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.|$|E
50|$|Viewers {{have often}} {{questioned}} Summer's paternity. On March 21, 2013, Zap2it ran a poll asking fans <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> Summer was an Abbott or a Newman, and an overwhelming 76% (1,928 voters) concluded that Summer was an Abbott.|$|R
50|$|In February 2016, Public Policy Polling asked {{registered}} voters in Florida {{ahead of the}} Republican primary <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> Cruz to be the Zodiac Killer; 10% believed and 28% were not sure. The other 62% did not think he was.|$|R
50|$|This {{established}} {{the concept of}} an “equitable rent,” and provided for the fixing of such rents for dwellinghouses. It also bestowed upon tenants the right to have their rent assessed <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that it was not an “equitable rent".|$|R

25|$|The rotary {{electric}} shaver {{was invented by}} a Jewish engineer named Alexandre Horowitz. Many Orthodox Jews prefer to grow beards, {{for a variety of}} religious, social, and cultural reasons, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that {{electric shaver}}s would be permitted; many Orthodox Jews, even non-Haredi Orthodox Jews, today grow beards to keep the tradition of their ancestors, regardless of the permissibility of their removal.|$|E
50|$|The {{psychological}} {{value of}} marching fire was quickly recognized. Marching fire {{was seen as}} a boost to the morale of the assault troops. It was hoped that enemy troops would lose courage <b>if</b> <b>they</b> heard bullets flying around them, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that their position was known to the attackers.|$|R
50|$|After {{the team}} sang {{the first two}} lines, their opponents could {{challenge}} <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the lines sung were incorrect; a correct challenge earned that team the right to sing the first two lines for the 20 points, but an incorrect challenge penalized them 20 points.|$|R

Their responses led him to accuse them of [...] "denying Norwegian culture".|$|R
25|$|Voluntary liquidations {{occur when}} the company's members decide voluntarily to wind up {{the affairs of the}} company. This may be because they believe that the company will soon become insolvent, or it may be on {{economic}} grounds <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that the purpose for which the company was formed is now at an end, or that the company is not providing an adequate return on assets and should be broken up and sold off.|$|E
25|$|Amyraldism (or {{sometimes}} Amyraldianism, {{also known}} as the School of Saumur, hypothetical universalism, post redemptionism, moderate Calvinism, or four-point Calvinism) is the belief that God, prior to his decree of election, decreed Christ's atonement for all alike <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe,</b> but seeing that none would believe on their own, he then elected those whom he will bring to faith in Christ, thereby preserving the Calvinist doctrine of unconditional election. The efficacy of the atonement remains limited to those who believe.|$|E
25|$|The Christian {{view of the}} New Covenant is a new {{relationship}} between God and humans mediated by Jesus which necessarily includes all people, both Jews and Gentiles, upon sincere declaration that one believes in Jesus Christ as Lord and God. The New Covenant also breaks the generational curse of the original sin on all children of Adam <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> in Jesus Christ, after people are judged for their own sins, {{which is expected to}} happen with the second arrival of Jesus Christ.|$|E
60|$|When we were {{dismissed}} the contention {{was greater than}} before the colonel spoke, and I began to believe {{it would have been}} better had he held his peace, for surely it seemed as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> his words of cheer were but proof that he shared their fears.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} the Relational Responding Task (RRT) {{as a tool}} for capturing beliefs at the implicit level. Flemish participants were asked to respond as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that Flemish people are more intelligent than immigrants (e. g., respond true to the statement Flemish people are wiser than immigrants) or to respond as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that immigrants are more intelligent than Flemish people (e. g., respond true to the statement Flemish people are dumber than immigrants). The difference in performance between these two tasks correlated with ratings {{of the extent to which}} participants explicitly endorsed the belief that Flemish people are more intelligent than immigrants and with questionnaire measures of subtle and blatant racism. The current study provides a first step towards validating RRT effects as a viable measure of implicit beliefs...|$|R
50|$|A {{survey in}} the United States {{of more than}} 10,000 {{physicians}} came to the result that approximately 16% of physicians would ever consider halting life-sustaining therapy because the family demands it, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that it was premature. Approximately 55% would not, and for the remaining 29%, it would depend on circumstances.|$|R
25|$|The Council of Europe's {{most famous}} {{achievement}} is the European Convention on Human Rights, which was adopted in 1950 following {{a report by}} the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, and followed on from the United Nations 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights' (UDHR). The Convention created the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The Court supervises compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and thus functions as the highest European court. It is to this court that Europeans can bring cases <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that a member country has violated their fundamental rights and freedoms.|$|E
25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> they are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E
25|$|A second {{explanation}} {{issued by}} Janssen and Vanhamme {{is that of}} reciprocal altruism. This is a key concept in evolutionary psychology that is argued to fuel all human behaviour: people only do something {{if they can get}} something back in return. In the case of CSR and ethical consumerism, however, consumers get very little in return for their investment. Ethically sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However, the reward for consumers is not much different from that of a non-ethical counterpart. Therefore, evolutionary speaking making an ethical purchase is not worth the higher cost to the individual even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> in supporting ethically, environmentally and socially beneficial causes.|$|E
5000|$|On April 1, 2004, Magic {{designer}} Mark Rosewater posted an article, {{announcing the}} sequel to Unglued, Unhinged. [...] The next day, amid speculation that the announcement was an April Fool's Day joke, Rosewater posted a poll asking readers <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> an Unglued sequel was actually in the works and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would enjoy such a sequel. Three days later, Rosewater confirmed that Unhinged was a reality.|$|R
40|$|Quality {{in online}} catalogs is {{generally}} {{presumed to be}} high. Ms. Briscoe examined a number of online catalog entries and documented the accuracy of selected bibliographic records.

50|$|The initial {{collecting}} {{of images}} begun in Bogota.

25|$|Deacon and Valentiner (2000) {{conducted}} a study that examined co-morbid panic attacks and substance use in a non-clinical sample of young adults who experienced regular panic attacks. The authors found that compared to healthy controls, therapeutic alcohol and sedative use was greater for non-clinical participants who experienced panic attacks. These {{findings are consistent with}} the suggestion made by Cox, Norton, Dorward, and Fergusson (1989) that panic disorder patients self-medicate <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that certain substances will be successful in alleviating their symptoms. If panic disorder patients are indeed self-medicating, there may be a portion of the population with undiagnosed panic disorder who will not seek professional help {{as a result of their}} own self-medication. In fact, for some patients panic disorder is only diagnosed after they seek treatment for their self-medication habit.|$|E
25|$|Often, fans {{engage in}} protests {{regarding}} players <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that regionalism has affected selection, {{or because of}} regional partisan support for local players. In 2005, when Sourav Ganguly was dropped {{due to lack of}} form, Ganguly's home state of West Bengal erupted in protests. India later played a match against South Africa in Kolkata, West Bengal. The Indian team was booed by the Bengali crowd who supported South Africa instead of India in response to Ganguly's dropping. Similar regional divisions in India regarding selection have also caused protests against the team, with political activists from the regional Kalinga Kamgar Sena party in Odisha disrupting the arrival of the team in Cuttack for an ODI over the lack of a local player in the team, with one activist manhandling coach Greg Chappell. Similar treatment was handed to India's Marathi captain Sunil Gavaskar in the 1980s by Bengali crowds, with consecutive Tests in Calcutta requiring police intervention due to crowd rioting.|$|E
25|$|Both high RD and RI {{individuals}} {{are found to}} have difficulty in making decisions that have future consequences. Individuals high in RD experience greater reinforcement when initially engaging in the addictive behaviour, and experience stronger conditioned associations with continued use. Individuals high in RI experience greater difficulty resisting cravings {{even in the face}} of negative consequences. Some moderators of RD and RI on the severity of addiction are stress and negative affect (such as feeling depressed). That is, individuals high in RD/RI who also experience high levels of negative affect or stress, present more severe addictive behaviours. For example, if an individual is experiencing emotional distress, the distress experienced may lessen impulse control <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that engaging in addictive behaviour will decrease negative affect. According to this model, adolescents who are high in RI are at greater risk for developing addictions. Interestingly, low RI has been shown to moderate some of the risk of addiction due to family history. High RI for individual without a family history of addiction has been related to poor decision-making.|$|E
5000|$|H.R.926, passed 415-14 on March 1, 1995, {{required}} {{federal agencies}} to provide a cost-benefit analysis on any regulation costing $50m or more annually, to be signed off on by the Office of Management and Budget, and permitted small businesses to sue that agency <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the aforementioned analysis was performed inadequately or incorrectly.|$|R
50|$|On June 8, 2015, the Department of Education {{announced}} that it was developing a process that would allow former students of Everest (along with other Corinthian schools) to apply for debt relief, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> were victims of fraud.

50|$|When {{the game}} debuted on Illinois' Luckiest {{the rules were}} different. After the captain {{was done in the}} machine, the team had to make a decision. They could keep the money grabbed or gamble it for $75,000 <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the captain grabbed the $1,000 bill. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> gamble and the bill was grabbed, they win the top prize. However, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> gamble and the bill wasn't grabbed, the {{winnings}} were reduced to $10,000.|$|R
