You go into the 'life is too short' category." [...] Noting that {{the first half of the}} New York Times review of The Birth of a Nation is taken up with the controversy, this person adds, [...] "No matter what Nate Parker makes, ... this will always be the first paragraph."

After stealing some hot peat and acquiring a small boat, Assipattle is driven by the waves into the stoor worm's mouth as it starts yawning.

Assipattle plunges the still burning peat into the stoor worm's liver, causing a [...] "fire that blazed like a furnace". The pain of its burning liver causes the creature to have a fit of retching that carries Assipattle, who has managed to return to his boat, back out of the monster's mouth.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{developers}} {{sought to}} make the game's environment more [...] "fantasy-oriented" [...] than its PlayStation predecessors. Since the creators wanted to prevent the series from following a redundant setting, Final Fantasy IX distinctly breaks from the futuristic styles of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII by reintroducing a medieval setting. In the game, steam technology <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> to become widely available; the population relies on hydropower or wind power for energy sources, but sometimes harness Mist or steam to power more advanced engines. Continuing with the medieval theme, the game's setting is inspired by Norse and Northern European mythology. According to Ito, [...] " [...] attracted to European history and mythology because of its depth and its drama". The main Final Fantasy IX website says {{the development of the}} game's world serves as a culmination of the series by blending the [...] "successful elements of the past, such as a return to the fantasy roots," [...] with newer elements. The creators made the characters a high priority. The return to the series' roots also affected the characters' designs, which resulted in characters with [...] "comic-like looks". Composer Nobuo Uematsu commented that the design staff attempted to give the characters realism while still appearing comic-like. To accomplish this, and to satisfy fans who had become used to the realistic designs of Final Fantasy VIII, the designers stressed creating characters with whom the player could easily relate.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a letter}} dated September 17, 1933, Gerald Ford wrote: [...] "Herm Everhardus and myself {{just had a}} couple bottles of beer a piece, and did they ever taste good after {{drinking}} milk (and that's all) at the training table. After abstaining {{for a couple of}} days, it was really very refreshing." [...] Only months earlier, the consumption of beer would have been illegal. [...] An amendment to the Volstead Act allowing the sale of beer went into effect in April 1933. [...] The availability of beer had a noticeable impact in Ann Arbor on football Saturdays. [...] On October 8, 1933, the day after the Michigan-Michigan State football game, Ford noted that his fraternity was planning a big party with a barrel of beer. [...] He added, [...] "You should have seen the campus this week-end, more drunks than ever and they all claim that the year <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning.</b> I'm afraid to imagine what it will be by the Ohio State game." [...] Ford's concern proved prescient. [...] After the Ohio State game, the university attracted unwanted national publicity when its board in control of athletics mailed notices to ticket holders warning that they would be ejected if complaints were received about their drinking. [...] The notices stated that the board was not concerned with [...] "the personal habits and tastes" [...] of ticket-holders, but felt a deep concern [...] "when indulgence in such habits and tastes results in conduct disgusting or offensive to other patrons." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Bartlett's book The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil was published. The 200,000-word study {{applies the}} science of {{pathology}} to the human species {{in order to identify}} and describe many dispositionally-based pathologies that afflict our species, often without our awareness. A central purpose of the book is to bring together and discuss the work of twentieth century psychologists, psychiatrists, ethologists, psychologically-focused historians, and others who have studied the underlying psychology of human aggression and destructiveness. The conclusions of the study emphasize that human pathology has many originating factors, that people obtain varied cognitive and emotional gratifications from such pathology, and that human pathology is a normal human condition and is therefore generally intractable, at least at this stage of human development. Bartlett describes how deficits in what he defines as moral intelligence combine with the psychology of stupidity, which together form major contributors to the psychological shortcomings that result in human pathology. In critical responses to the book, the study was commended by The Journal of Analytical Psychology: [...] "Bartlett is a lucid, painstaking and illuminating writer. This is certainly a classic work of reference in the field." [...] The Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic appraised the book as [...] "a challenging and thought provoking approach that makes a significant contribution to an aspect of human psychopathology that is rarely or so comprehensively addressed." [...] About the book, M. Scott Peck commented: [...] "he study of evil <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> and you are a pioneer." [...] Eric Zillmer, Carl R. Pacifico Professor of Neuropsychology at Drexel University, commended the book: [...] "Steven James Bartlett's The Pathology of Man marks the most comprehensive examination of evil to date. Drawing from different fields of study, including psychology and epistemology, Bartlett sets out on a Tour de Force of delineating the parameters on human evil.... The resulting text is a most welcome addition to the field and provides for fascinating reading. The Pathology of Man is a timely, scholarly, and important piece of work that should appeal to anyone who is interested in understanding human evil." [...] Author and President of the Jewish Life Network Irving Greenberg commented: [...] "This book is stunning, upsetting, gripping.... he book is a moral act of the highest order. These...comments would be incomplete without mentioning the erudition, the intellectual insight and playfulness, the gallows humor and the self-restraint which deepen and lighten this book." [...] Since the publication of The Pathology of Man, Bartlett has published a series of further books and papers related to the same and related subjects.|$|E
