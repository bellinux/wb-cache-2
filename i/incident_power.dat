2500|$|Heating of the EUV mask {{pellicle}} (film temperature up to 750 K for 80 W <b>incident</b> <b>power)</b> is {{a significant}} concern, due to the resulting deformation and transmission decrease. ASML developed a 70nm thick polysilicon pellicle membrane, which allows EUV transmission of 82%; however, {{less than half of}} the membranes survived expected EUV power levels. SiNx pellicle membranes also failed at 82 W equivalent EUV source power levels. [...] Alternative [...] materials need to allow sufficient transmission as well as maintain mechanical and thermal stability. However, graphite, graphene or other carbon nanomaterials (nanosheets, nanotubes) are damaged by EUV due to the release of electrons and also too easily etched in the hydrogen cleaning plasma expected to be deployed in EUV scanners. [...] Hydrogen plasmas can also etch silicon as well. A coating helps improve hydrogen resistance, but this reduces transmission and/or emissivity, and may also affect mechanical stability (e.g., bulging). The current lack of any suitable pellicle material, aggravated by the use of hydrogen plasma cleaning in the EUV scanner, presents an obstacle to volume production.|$|E

The resistance of the 2 DHG is found to decrease significantly upon illumination with 640 nm radiation of <b>incident</b> <b>powers</b> as low as ~ 1 fW. The change in resistance persists after the illumination is switched off, indicating the persistent photoconductivity effect. The sensitivity of the sample to light exposure was measured over several orders of <b>incident</b> <b>powers</b> from ∼ 1 fW to 10 nW and found to increase with power. By comparing the sensitivity in different normal and inverted heterostructures it was concluded that the high sensitivity of the inverted structures is due to the high mobility of the photocarriers confined in the channel closer to the top interface...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{researches}} on the offset {{error of}} self-triggering pulsed mini laser radar. It theoretically analyzes the variation of space charge region of PN junction in receiving photodiode. The variation value {{is affected by}} the different <b>incident</b> light <b>power.</b> One of conclusion is the laser pulse time-of-flight affected by the variation of <b>incident</b> light <b>power.</b> Another conclusion is the laser pulse width affected by the variation of <b>incident</b> light <b>power</b> as well. The paper proposes the basic equations to describe this phenomenon. In addition, the new designed experimental devices are used to prove that the theoretical analysis is true. This new system can effectively solve the offset error problems, and the negatively impact of offset error will be eliminated on the receiver of self-triggering pulsed mini laser radar system...|$|R
