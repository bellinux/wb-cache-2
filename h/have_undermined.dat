5|$|After his {{translation}} to Canterbury, Stigand released Elmham to {{his brother}} Æthelmær, but retained the bishopric of Winchester. Canterbury and Winchester were the two richest sees in England, and while precedent allowed the holding of a rich see along with a poor one, there was no precedent for holding two rich sees concurrently. He may have retained Winchester out of avarice, or his hold on Canterbury {{may not have been}} secure. Besides these, he held the abbey of Gloucester and the abbey of Ely and perhaps other abbeys also. Whatever his reasons, the retention of Winchester made Stigand a pluralist: the holder of more than one benefice at the same time. This was a practice that was targeted for elimination by the growing reform movement in the church. Five successive popes (Leo IX, Victor II, Stephen IX, Nicholas II and Alexander II) excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury at the same time. It has been suggested by the historian Emma Mason that Edward refused to remove Stigand because this would <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> the royal prerogative to appoint bishops and archbishops without papal input. Further hurting Stigand's position, Pope Nicholas II in 1061 declared pluralism to be uncanonical unless approved by the pope.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{bombing of}} North Vietnam in February 1965 had a decisive {{impact on the}} Soviet Union's {{strategy}} in Vietnam. Since Ho Chi Minh and his Communist Party won control of North Vietnam in 1954, Ho's government had not always enjoyed cordial relations with their Soviet allies. For example, in 1957 the Soviet government proposed that both North and South Vietnam be given {{a seat in the}} United Nations, a move which would <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> the North's claim as the sole legitimate government of the whole country. Then in February 1964, North Vietnam joined the People's Republic of China in refusing to sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was an insult to the policy of co-existence adopted by the then Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. By that time, however, Khrushchev had already begun the process of disengagement from Vietnam because of the growing conflict in the region was becoming more expensive for the Soviet Union, with North Vietnam relying more on it for large amounts of economic and military aid.|$|E

Monetary policy and mounting regulation is argued to <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> the innovative forces of the market economies. Quantitative easing following the financial crises is argued to have not only conserved structural distortions in the economy, leading to a fall in trend-growth; it also created new distortions and contributes to distributional conflicts.|$|E

25|$|From the outset, Brazil’s {{nuclear program}} has been {{shrouded}} in secrecy. Nuclear issues are still considered {{a matter of national}} security and sovereignty, despite Brazil’s democratic makeup and transition away from military dictatorship. There is little transparency regarding the various nuclear activities under the government’s purview and the potential impact these can have on public health and the environment. Moreover, numerous attempts to keep radioactive accidents and incidents secret <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> credibility of nuclear enterprises and led to distrust among the public.|$|E

United States and Korematsu v. United States. The report would <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> the administration's position of the military necessity for such action, as it concluded that most Japanese Americans were not a national security threat, and that allegations of communication espionage had been found to be without basis by the FBI and Federal Communications Commission.|$|E

25|$|In {{preparing}} for the sentencing hearing, defense counsel spoke with Washington about his background but did not seek out character witnesses or request a psychiatric examination. The counsel's decision not to present evidence concerning Washington's character and emotional state reflected his judgment that it was advisable {{to rely on the}} plea colloquy for evidence as to such matters, thus preventing the state from cross-examining Washington and from presenting psychiatric evidence of its own. Counsel did not request a presentence report because it would have included Washington's criminal history and thereby would <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> the claim of no significant prior criminal record.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{the coming}} into effect of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1985 saw {{a shift in the}} gay rights {{movement}} in Canada, as Canadian gays and lesbians moved from liberation to litigious strategies. Premised on Charter protections and on the notion of the immutability of homosexuality, judicial rulings rapidly advanced rights, including those that compelled the Canadian government to legalize same-sex marriage. It has been argued that while this strategy was extremely effective in advancing the safety, dignity and equality of Canadian homosexuals, its emphasis of sameness came at the expense of difference and may <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> opportunities for more meaningful change.|$|E
25|$|In June 2007, {{the same}} {{newspaper}} raised questions over {{to what extent}} Boyd's decision not to prosecute the SCRO personnel {{in the autumn of}} 2000 was related to the then ongoing Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial, where he was leading the prosecution.

25|$|The {{song was}} written in 1905 during the first {{partition}} of Bengal, when the ruling British Empire had an undivided India's province of Bengal split into two parts; the decision was announced on 19 July by the then-Viceroy of India Lord Curzon, taking effect on 16 October. This divide of Bengal, being along communal lines–East Bengal having a majority of Muslims and West Bengal having a majority of Hindus–is claimed to <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> India's national movement against British imperialism and to have been politically motivated. Along {{with a host of}} others, songs such as this were meant to rekindle the unified spirit of Bengal, to raise public consciousness against the communal political divide.|$|E
25|$|Certain themes appear {{repeatedly}} in {{depictions of the}} journey. Ra overcomes numerous obstacles in his course, representative of the effort necessary to maintain maat. The greatest challenge is the opposition of Apep, a serpent god who represents the destructive aspect of disorder, and who threatens to destroy the sun god and plunge creation into chaos. In many of the texts, Ra overcomes these obstacles {{with the assistance of}} other deities who travel with him; they stand for various powers that are necessary to uphold Ra's authority. In his passage Ra also brings light to the Duat, enlivening the blessed dead who dwell there. In contrast, his enemies—people who <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> maat—are tormented and thrown into dark pits or lakes of fire.|$|E
25|$|World War II {{interrupted}} {{the development of}} Polish science, as both the Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, who occupied Poland closed down Polish educational and research institutions and persecuted Polish intelligentsia, including social scientists (see Polish culture during World War II for details). In the early period in communist Poland (the Stalinist period of 1948-1956), sociology was banned by the communist authorities as a bourgeois pseudoscience (see also suppressed research in the Soviet Union). Polish sociology was, however, revived following the Gomułka's Thaw in 1956, with {{the foundation of the}} Polish Sociological Association and with Warsaw and Łódź becoming a major centers for sociological studies. Later on, Polish sociology (as all other social sciences in the communist bloc) had to deal with Marxist influence and political interference. Due to these developments, Marxist approaches were overrepresented and some studies were censored or not allowed (for example, research was restricted into political organization of society, to prevent scholars from openly advocating ideas that might <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> the communist government). This also led to circulation of underground, illegal publications (bibuła). The notable names of the early postwar period include Stanisław Ossowski and his wife, Maria Ossowska, Julian Hochfeld, Józef Chałasiński and Andrzej Malewski. Zygmunt Bauman fled the University of Warsaw to work at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, {{a book by}} Rick Rowden titled The Deadly Ideas of Neoliberalism: How the IMF <b>has</b> <b>Undermined</b> Public Health and the Fight Against AIDS, {{claimed that}} the IMF's {{monetarist}} approach towards prioritising price stability (low inflation) and fiscal restraint (low budget deficits) was unnecessarily restrictive and has prevented developing countries from scaling up long-term investment in public health infrastructure. The book claimed the consequences have been chronically underfunded public health systems, leading to demoralising working conditions that have fuelled a [...] "brain drain" [...] of medical personnel, all of which <b>has</b> <b>undermined</b> {{public health and the}} fight against HIV/AIDS in developing countries.|$|R
25|$|The {{implemented}} {{service from}} High Barnet branch gave good access {{both to the}} West End and the City. This appears to <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> traffic on the Alexandra Palace branch, still run with steam haulage to Kings Cross via Finsbury Park, as Highgate (low-level) was but a short bus ride away and car traffic was much lighter than it would become later. Consequently, the line from Finsbury Park to Muswell Hill and Alexandra Palace via the surface platforms at Highgate was closed altogether to passenger traffic in 1954. This contrasts with the decision to electrify the Epping-Ongar branch of the Central line, another remnant of the New Works programme, run as a tube-train shuttle from 1957. A local pressure group, the Muswell Hill Metro Group, campaigns to reopen this route as a light-rail service. So far {{there is no sign}} of movement on this issue: the route, now the Parkland Walk, is highly valued by walkers and cyclists, and suggestions in the 1990s that it could, in part, become a road were met with fierce opposition. Another pressure group has proposed using the track bed further north, as part of the North and West London Light Railway. The connection between Drayton Park and the surface platforms at Finsbury Park was opened in 1976, when the Northern City Line became part of British Rail.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his death}} in around 624, Rædwald was succeeded by his {{surviving}} son Eorpwald, who was then converted to the Christian faith shortly after becoming king. According to the historian N. J. Higham, Edwin of Northumbria was able to persuade Eorpwald into accepting an [...] "alien cult", whose authority rested outside East Anglia, with Paulinus of York, Edwin's bishop. Eorpwald may have been sponsored by King Edwin at his baptism, which {{would have resulted in}} Edwin being acknowledged as Eorpwald's lord. The East Angles may also have been baptised as a people, which would <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> Eorpwald's authority as king and acted against the authority of any long-established pagan cults.|$|E
500|$|In 1881, {{following}} the death of his father, Reed became head of the company. By then he had begun his monumental [...] history which was published in 1887. Along with his B.O.P. contributions Reed wrote regular articles and book reviews for his cousin Edward Baines's newspaper, the Leeds Mercury. He was [...] a co-founder and first honorary secretary of the Bibliographical Society, [...] and [...] a trustee for his family's charities. All this activity may <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> his health; after struggling with illness for most of 1893, Reed died in November that year, at the age of 41.

500|$|Brant {{then joined}} forces with Captain Walter Butler (the son of John Butler), leading two {{companies}} of Butler's Rangers commanded by Captains John McDonell and William Caldwell for {{an attack on the}} major Schoharie Creek settlement of Cherry Valley. [...] Butler's forces also included 300 Senecas, probably led by either Cornplanter or Sayenqueraghta, and 50 British Army soldiers from the 8th Regiment of Foot. [...] As the force moved toward Cherry Valley, Butler and Brant quarreled over Brant's recruitment of Loyalists. [...] Butler was unhappy at Brant's successes in this sphere, and threatened to withhold provisions from Brant's Loyalist volunteers. [...] Ninety of them ended up leaving the expedition, and Brant himself {{was on the verge of}} doing so when his Indian supporters convinced him to stay. [...] The dispute did not sit well with the Indian forces, and may <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> Butler's tenuous authority over them.|$|E
500|$|Descartes' {{argument}} crucially {{depends on}} the premise that what Seth believes to be [...] "clear and distinct" [...] ideas in his mind are necessarily true. Many contemporary philosophers doubt this. For example, Joseph Agassi suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early 20th century <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> the idea of privileged access to one's own ideas. Freud claimed that a psychologically-trained observer can understand a person's unconscious motivations better than the person himself does. Duhem has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person's methods of discovery better than that person herself does, while Malinowski has shown that an anthropologist can know a person's customs and habits better than the person whose customs and habits they are. He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people to see things that are not there provide grounds for rejecting Descartes' argument, because scientists can describe a person's perceptions better than the person herself can.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1578, Oai moved to Hamamatsu Castle, where she took over {{management}} of the kitchen. She became very popular with the unit of warriors from her native province, who not only admired her beauty, but regarded her as a gentle and virtuous example of the women of Mikawa. [...] While her manners and gentility were exemplary, she could, when the occasion warranted, be outspoken or sarcastic in speech, the probable result of growing up around rustic warriors in a remote castle outpost. [...] With her move {{to the court of}} Ieyasu, Oai entered a bitter arena where prospective concubines schemed and competed with each other for a chance to bear Ieyasu's child. [...] Bearing the child of a powerful samurai, especially a son, was one way an ambitious young woman of the period could elevate her status, ensure a comfortable life, and guarantee the prosperity of her family. [...] These women usually relied on their physical attributes and sexual prowess to keep their lord's attention, and some resorted to the use of aphrodisiacs. [...] Unlike these courtesans, Oai already had the attention of Ieyasu, which would <b>have</b> <b>undermined</b> the ambitions of some and very likely made her a target of resentment, hostility, and the intrigues that were common in Japanese harems.|$|E
