25|$|The 1966 model's frontal {{appearance}} was mildly altered with an eggcrate grille insert {{to replace the}} previous horizontal bars, and the coupe lost its roof-mounted extractor vents, which had proven inefficient. Corvettes also received an emblem {{in the corner of}} the hood for 1966. Head rests were a new option, one of the rarest options was the Red/Red Automatic option with power windows and air conditioning from factory which records show production numbered only 7 convertibles and 33 coupes. This relative lack of change reflected plans to bring out an all-new Corvette for 1967. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not reflect a fall-off in the car's popularity, however. In fact, 1966 would prove another record-busting year, with volume rising to 27,720 units, up some 4,200 over 1965s sales.|$|E
25|$|Less than a {{month after}} the {{engagement}} at Plum Point, the River Defense Fleet was again in action against the Western Gunboat Flotilla, but conditions were far from the same. One change {{may or may not have}} had a significant effect on the battle. The strange divided command system of the fleet, in which the guns were manned by artillerymen who were not part of the crews, unraveled in the face of mounting Confederate losses that affected morale adversely. The gunners and rivermen were increasingly at odds, and on at least one occasion the soldiers refused to accompany the fleet on a minor mission. Finally, on 5 June 1862, Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson removed his men. This would certainly have been serious if the rams had been intended to rely on their guns. As it was, the departure of the soldiers affected the fleet only marginally, although <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not help.|$|E
500|$|It is possible, therefore, that a {{historical}} king named Ælle existed, who {{arrived from the}} continent in the late 5th century, and who conquered {{much of what is}} now Sussex. [...] He may have been a prominent war chief with a leadership role in a federation of Anglo-Saxon groups fighting for territory in Britain at that time. [...] This may be the origin of the reputation that led Bede to list him as holding overlordship over southern Britain. [...] The battles listed in the Chronicle are compatible with a conquest of Sussex from west to east, against British resistance stiff enough to last fourteen years. [...] His area of military control may have extended as far as Hampshire and north to the upper Thames valley, but <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not extend across all of England south of the Humber, as Bede asserts.|$|E

500|$|Author Brandon Friedman, also {{a combat}} veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, shared a similar view at VetVoice: [...] "The Hurt Locker is a high-tension, well-made, action movie that will {{certainly}} keep most viewers {{on the edges}} of their seats. But if you know anything about the Army, or about operations or life in Iraq, you'll be so distracted by the nonsensical sequences and plot twists that it will ruin the movie for you. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> for me." [...] Friedman criticized the inaccuracy of the film's representation of combat, saying [...] "in real life, EOD techs don't conduct dangerous missions as autonomous three-man teams without communications gear ... Another thing you'll rarely hear in combat is an EOD E-7 suggesting to two or three of his guys that they leave the scene of an explosion in an Iraqi city by saying: 'C'mon, let's split up. We can cover more ground that way.|$|E
2500|$|Moreover, in {{addition}} to recreational drugs, Duesberg argues that anti-HIV drugs such as zidovudine (AZT) can cause AIDS. Duesberg's claim that antiviral medication causes AIDS is regarded as disproven by the scientific community. Placebo-controlled {{studies have found that}} AZT as a single agent produces modest and short-lived improvements in survival and delays the development of opportunistic infections; <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not cause AIDS, which develops in both treated and untreated study patients. With the subsequent development of protease inhibitors and highly active antiretroviral therapy, numerous studies have documented the fact that anti-HIV drugs prevent the development of AIDS and substantially prolong survival, further disproving the claim that these drugs [...] "cause" [...] AIDS.|$|E
2500|$|On March 10, 2006, it was {{reported}} that Metallica was planning to use the following six months to write material for the album, in addition to the previous two months they had already been spending writing music. Ulrich also stated that the band was getting along much better in the studio than they did during the recording of St. Anger. On April 6, he revealed that the band had composed [...] "six to seven" [...] songs (except for vocals) from their findings off the riff tapes recording during pre-sets of the Madly in Anger with the World Tour. He also said that by this point, the band's new material was reminiscent of [...] "old school" [...] Metallica works, and that <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not feel like a St. Anger [...] "part two".|$|E

6000|$|In {{precisely}} the same way, Major Ellis proves the degeneration of deity in Africa, so far as being localised in place of being the Universal God, implies degeneration, as <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> to our minds.
