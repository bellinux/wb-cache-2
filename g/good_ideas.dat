5|$|Nobody except Leslie {{really cares}} about the trip: Ron (Nick Offerman) just wants to fish, Ben (Adam Scott) failed to bring a tent, and Tom (Aziz Ansari) just wants to relax in his huge tent filled with luxury {{electronic}} items. Tom expresses confusion as to why Ben, a state auditor who had been helping with Pawnee's financial problems, has not returned to his old job at Indianapolis; Ben does not explain his reasons, but it is hinted he harbors romantic feelings for Leslie. Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) sets up a romantic tent for April (Aubrey Plaza) in the wrong campsite miles away, forcing him to trek through the wilderness to find everyone and leaving April miserable on the campsite without Andy. During brainstorming sessions, nobody produces any <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> because they assume Leslie will think of one. However, she worriedly confides to Ann and Ben she cannot think of anything {{on the same level}} of the harvest festival.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} company profits are best re-invested in the company: {{research}} and development, capital investment, expansion, etc. Proponents {{of this view}} (and thus critics of dividends per se) suggest that an eagerness to return profits to shareholders may indicate the management having run out of <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> {{for the future of}} the company. Some studies, however, have demonstrated that companies that pay dividends have higher earnings growth, suggesting that dividend payments may be evidence of confidence in earnings growth and sufficient profitability to fund future expansion.|$|E
25|$|A1 was {{a revolutionary}} text, {{too far ahead}} of its time to be appreciated. When Grassmann {{submitted}} it to apply for a professorship in 1847, the ministry asked Ernst Kummer for a report. Kummer assured that there were <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> in it, but found the exposition deficient and advised against giving Grassmann a university position. Over the next 10-odd years, Grassmann wrote a variety of work applying his theory of extension, including his 1845 Neue Theorie der Elektrodynamik and several papers on algebraic curves and surfaces, in the hope that these applications would lead others to take his theory seriously.|$|E

500|$|Brett Alan Weiss, {{writing for}} Allgame, gave the game {{two out of}} five stars. Weiss wrote the game was not [...] "a {{particularly}} engaging gaming experience" [...] and {{referred to it as}} [...] "an interesting failure. The designers had a couple of <b>good</b> <b>ideas,</b> but the execution of those ideas in conjunction with the shoot-'em-up action is second rate". In his book Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984, Weiss wrote that the game's box art was better than the actual game.|$|E
500|$|While they conceded the film's audacious {{production}} made {{it worth}} {{their time to}} watch, other critics found flaws. [...] "It's not a great film. The story has some <b>good</b> <b>ideas,</b> but the execution is uneven," [...] wrote Peter Sciretta at /Film, while still recommending it as [...] "unlike anything you've seen before [...] see again". Similarly, CraveOnline's William Bibbiani [...] "wouldn't have missed it for the world" [...] but qualified it by noting that the film often lacked [...] "cohesion and clarity".|$|E
500|$|Gilbert {{was mostly}} {{collaborative}} with Dahl's work, as the writer declared: [...] "He not only helped in script conferences, but had some <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> {{and then left}} you alone, and when you produced the finished thing, he shot it. Other directors have such an ego {{that they want to}} rewrite it and put their own dialogue in, and it's usually disastrous. What I admired so much about Lewis Gilbert was that he just took the screenplay and shot it. That's the way to direct: You either trust your writer or you don't." ...|$|E

500|$|The Weinsteins had {{recently}} left the Walt Disney Company {{and according to}} Cory Edwards, they [...] "loved the idea of picking up an animated film and giving Disney a run for their money." [...] The involvement of the Weinstein Company encouraged Kanbar enough to enlist Skywalker Sound. The film was nearly complete {{by the time that}} the Weinsteins became involved, and Edwards has stated that nothing was done by them to ruin [...] "the original vision of the movie." [...] However, a few edit suggestions were made to quicken the film's pace which Edwards felt were <b>good</b> <b>ideas,</b> as he considered the first twenty minutes to be dragging.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{introduction}} of two planes and the turning button were considered <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> in theory, both features were heavily criticized by reviewers. Jeremy Dunham of IGN, Manny LaMancha of GamePro and Benjamin Turner of GameSpy felt it difficult to fight one-on-one when a player can start a cat-and-mouse game, while GameSpot's Greg Kasavin and Brian Gee of Game Revolution found the features to cause [...] "chaos". Turner said it deprived the player of the ability [...] "to have a normal Guilty Gear X2-style match", and Dunham said the computer reacted faster. David Smith of 1UP.com called it an [...] "irrational control scheme". The perceived poor execution of its new features led GameSpy {{to give it a}} special [...] "It Sounded Good on Paper" [...] award.|$|E
500|$|However, actress Kathleen Freeman {{stated that}} when people visited set of Singin' in the Rain to relate their {{experiences}} during the silent era, they would ask to speak with Kelly. Singin' in the Rain art director Randall Duell stated, [...] "Gene ran the show. Stan had some <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> and worked with Gene, {{but he was still}} the 'office boy' to Gene, in a sense, although Gene had great respect for him." [...] Kelly became more involved with the Singin' in the Rain script during its third draft, which was when its structure began to resemble the final version. Comparing Donen and Kelly's films as solo directors, Donen's were usually more critically acclaimed and financially successful than Kelly's films. Kelly's 1969 film Hello Dolly! is credited with effectively killing the Hollywood musical.|$|E

500|$|The {{cast and}} {{the crew of the}} show enjoyed the episode, for the most part. Co-producer Paul Rabwin said that the episode had some of the funniest {{material}} in The X-Files {{as well as some of}} the most horrific, such as the scene where a cockroach crawled into someone's arm. Gillian Anderson rated the episode one of her favorite episodes of the third season. On a more negative note, writer Darin Morgan ended up being unhappy with the final product, saying [...] "The other day, my girlfriend was saying, 'I never understood that episode,' and I guess I don't either. It was an episode that had a lot of what I thought were really <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> and never quite got it to work. I was really disappointed with that episode. Some people love it." [...] The plot for [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Les Martin, under the title Die, Bug, Die!.|$|E
500|$|As {{developers}} kept {{adding more}} features, the game ended up using all the extra memory on the debug consoles. As a result, the game became {{too big to}} fit into the Nintendo 64's 4MB of random-access memory (RAM). The developers soon realised that they were not able to optimise it and decided {{to make use of the}} Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which increases the Nintendo 64's RAM from 4MB to 8MB of contiguous main memory, to support most of the features in the game. The game's Counter Operative mode was inspired by [...] "Bottles' Revenge", an additional gameplay mode cut from the final release of Banjo-Tooie. After playing the release version of the game, Hollis was impressed by the comprehensive range of multiplayer options, which he described as [...] "a vast array of features I never planned". Doak, however, remarked that [...] "GoldenEye pretty much exhausted the performance of the machine. It was hard to push it further. Perfect Dark had some <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> but was dog slow." ...|$|E
500|$|Tamoor Hussain of GameSpot {{called it}} a modest action game whose length {{suffered}} a condition of insecurity, yet added that most of its ventures were carried out successfully. Hussain found the combat [...] "quite pleasing" [...] despite its simplicity, in particular the extraction of cores, which he likened to reeling in a fish. Though marred by an apparent lack of visual diversity, the world appeared conversely evocative according to Hussain. Also subject to complaint were lengthy and unsuccessful loading screens, and {{the rate at which}} the game would crash on the Xbox One. Sam Prell of GamesRadar wrote that ReCore signified <b>good</b> <b>ideas,</b> when poorly executed. Prell explains that, for all the game's positive aspects, they were outweighed by some considerable problems. He cited its extensive loading times as one of the most frequent offenders, which would also cause the game to crash. Other technical issues included bugs and frame rates that would scale down dramatically. The main story was nevertheless appreciated, even though it had a slight running time and, as concluded by Prell, resulted in a [...] "padded" [...] experience.|$|E

500|$|Joy Division {{made their}} {{recorded}} debut in June 1978 when the band self-released An Ideal for Living, {{and two weeks}} later a track of theirs, [...] "At a Later Date", was featured on the compilation album [...] (which had been recorded live in October 1977). In the Melody Maker review of the EP, Chris Brazier said that it [...] "has the familiar rough-hewn nature of home-produced records, but they're no mere drone-vendors—there {{are a lot of}} <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> here, and they could be a very interesting band by now, seven months on". The packaging of An Ideal for Living—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band's name, fuelled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later admitted to being intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris insisted that the group's obsession with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band [...] "to keep on doing it, because that's the kind of people we are".|$|E
500|$|Shankly {{began his}} Preston {{career in the}} reserves, who played in the Central League which was a higher {{standard}} than the North Eastern League. He made his first team debut on 9 December 1933, three months after his 20th birthday, against Hull City. Shankly created an early goal to help Preston win 5–0, earning him praise in a national newspaper for his [...] "clever passing". With his wholehearted attitude {{and commitment to the}} team, he quickly established himself as a first-team regular and became a crowd favourite. Preston fulfilled their potential and gained promotion to the First Division as runners-up to Grimsby Town. It was therefore a successful debut season for Shankly who stayed with Preston until he retired in 1949. His wage was increased to eight pounds a week with six pounds in the summer. In a summary of the 1933–34 season, a Preston correspondent, Walter Pilkington, wrote: [...] "One of this season's discoveries, Bill Shankly, played with rare tenacity and uncommonly <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> for a lad of 20. He is full of good football and possessed with unlimited energy; he should go far".|$|E
500|$|On {{the mixed}} to {{negative}} side, Joseph Stannard, {{in his review}} for Adventures in Modern Recording, opined The Age of Plastic [...] "sounds like unfinished business, a series of <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> in need of elaboration". Dave Marsh and John Swenson, writing for The Rolling Stone Record Guide, opined that [...] "aside from the wonderful 'Video Killed the Radio Star' — perhaps the most successful recent example of a single where the production was catchier than the material", the album was [...] "high-tech dreck". Betty Page from Sounds commented that the group [...] "stretches uncomfortably out into the long playing medium like a skein of well-chewed bubblegum." [...] In {{a review of the}} 1999 reissue of the album, Richard Wallace of Daily Mirror wrote that the record [...] "shows how [...] pioneered the synth-led nonsense which fused much of the decade's pop, but had little creative imagination. That bombastic electro-sound became [...] Horn's trademark as a producer. Skip it." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian has been the harshest on the LP, calling it [...] "awful beyond measure" [...] and [...] "everything bad that people say about the music industry: it's wasteful, it's stupid, it has no interest in actual music." ...|$|E
