500|$|After a {{year and}} a half of touring, Rise Against reconvened at the Blasting Room to record their fourth album, The Sufferer & the Witness. The band members were {{dissatisfied}} with Richardson's contributions to Siren Song of the Counter Culture, as he produced a more polished and heavier album than their previous works. As a result, they decided to return to Stevenson and Livermore, whom they felt had accurately captured the punk sound they were going for on Revolutions per Minute. Unlike the stressful recording sessions for Siren Song of the Counter Culture, the band had a much more enjoyable time with The Suffer & the Witness, as they no longer sought the approval of Geffen executives. According to McIlrath: [...] "It went great, the songs just flowed out of us. There were really few questions and the song lyrics would <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of us, it went really well and everyone really liked them." ...|$|E

[...] "She's Madonna" [...] was inspired by a conversation Williams had with his ex-girlfriend Tania Strecker, who told the story of how her boyfriend, British director Guy Ritchie, left her for American singer Madonna. Strecker quoted Ritchie as saying, [...] "Look, you know I really love you, but she's Madonna." [...] Williams considered the song to be one of Rudeboxs lighter moments, clarifying that the track did not have a tongue in cheek connotation about it. Rather it literally spoke about his fantasies for Madonna and he was happy with the song's outcome. According to Contactmusic.com, Williams had played the song to Madonna shortly after writing it, receiving a positive reaction.|$|E

500|$|In May 2005, English actor Daniel Craig stated MGM and {{producers}} Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured {{him he would}} get the role of Bond, and Matthew Vaughn told reporters MGM offered {{him the opportunity to}} direct the new film, but Eon Productions at that point had not approached either of them. A year beforehand, Craig rejected the idea of starring, as he felt the series had descended into formula; only when he read the script did he become interested. Craig read all of Fleming's novels to prepare for the part, and cited Mossad and British Secret Service agents who served as advisors on the set of Munich as inspiring because, [...] "Bond has <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the service and he's a killer.

500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone new. That inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric. I was saying ... that I may not really be a virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E
500|$|Yankovic was {{inspired}} to write the song after he heard The Kinks' song [...] "Lola" [...] while driving in his car one day. He noted, [...] "I was driving a rent-a-car through Florida when the song 'Lola' came on the radio, and it got me thinking about how much fun I had doing 'Yoda' [...] where I took a then-current topic and combined it with a classic rock tune." [...] He soon {{turned his attention to}} the film Jurassic Park—about a park on a fictional island, where geneticists have succeeded in cloning dinosaurs. The film is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton—which had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> and was already a blockbuster success. Yankovic decided to write a parody about the movie, and considered various songs that he could spoof. Eventually, he decided to parody the 1968 hit single [...] "MacArthur Park", which was performed by Richard Harris. Yankovic approached the original song's writer, Jimmy Webb, who agreed to the idea. In fact, Webb was so amused by the parody that he later penned a letter to Yankovic that read, [...] "Well, [...] oughta [...] bury that song once and for all!" [...] In addition, Yankovic received permission from Crichton and director Steven Spielberg to produce the track.|$|E

500|$|Ball {{was born}} on April 22, 1881 in Grand Haven, Michigan. After his Major League career ended, {{he went on to}} coach the Baltimore Orioles (who were a minor league team at the time). It was there that he was {{assigned}} to train Babe Ruth, who had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys. Ball described Ruth as [...] "the dumbest and yet the strongest player" [...] he had ever coached. The two remained good friends after Ruth broke into the Majors and even played a friendly game of bowling against one another in 1923 (with Ball edging out Ruth, winning four out of the seven games played). Ruth held Ball in great respect, and because of their close friendship in baseball, he eventually became a fan of the New York Yankees. In the 1950s, an annual bowling tournament held at the Newfield Alleys near Bridgeport, Connecticut was named after Ball in order to honor the city's famous inhabitant. On February 12, 1952, at the age of 71, his health severely deteriorated due to a heart ailment and he was rushed to Bridgeport Hospital, where he was placed on the danger list and visitors were prohibited from seeing him. Five years later, he died on October 15, 1957 and was interred at Mountain Grove Cemetery, Bridgeport.|$|E
500|$|In his 1908 autobiography, Barrington repeats a {{line from}} a first night review of his {{performance}} as Dr Daly in The Sorcerer: [...] "Mr Barrington is wonderful. [...] He always manages to sing one-sixteenth of a tone flat; it's so like a vicar." [...] Barrington {{went on to say}} that producer Richard D'Oyly Carte later came to see him, saying, [...] "...what's the matter? ...some one has <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the stalls to tell me you are singing in tune. [...] It will never do." [...] Barrington said that [...] "This pleased me so much that I have never sung flat since, except, of course, when I wished...." [...] Several contemporaries did find Barrington's singing occasionally flat, including Francois Cellier. Many years later, in her memoir, Ellaline Terriss wrote: [...] "...dear old Rutland scarcely ever did sing in tune – but how grand he was.... He had a beautifully clear diction and a marvellous sense of timing – and was one of the finest singers of the then popular topical songs that our stage ever knew." [...] Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald wrote of Barrington in his 1899 book, The Savoy Opera, [...] "His peculiar tranquil or impassive style has always exactly suited the characters allotted to him, and it would now be difficult to imagine a Savoy opera without him. However, Barrington's performance as Dr Daly impressed the critics and audiences, and he won a permanent place in D'Oyly Carte's company.|$|E
500|$|O'Brien had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> {{of drama}} school {{when she was}} cast as Vicki; it was her first {{television}} acting job. Director Christopher Barry originally wanted Bernard Archard {{for the role of}} Bennett/Koquillion, but was not able to get him. Barry would later cast Archard in The Power of the Daleks (1966). The role went to Australian actor Ray Barrett, whom Barry had seen on TV and marked in his book of actors he wanted to remember, and so he [...] "dug him out of the book" [...] when the time came. Barrett played Bennett as a [...] "normal, straight human being" [...] so as not to give the ending away. To preserve the mystery, Koquillion was credited in the first episode as being played by [...] "Sydney Wilson"— a name made up by the production team in tribute to two of the creators of Doctor Who, Sydney Newman and Donald Wilson. This was the first instance of an alias being used in the credits in order to conceal a plot twist in Doctor Who; the practice would be employed later on to conceal the appearance of villains Davros and the Master. Tom Sheridan provided the voice of the space captain and also played the Sand Beast. He was originally scheduled to play one of the Didonians at the end, but for unknown reasons they were played by two uncredited extras, John Stuart and Colin Hughes.|$|E

500|$|... "Cool" [...] was {{originally}} written by Dallas Austin {{after listening to}} Stefani's group No Doubt's song [...] "Underneath It All" [...] (2002). Austin commented {{that he was trying}} to write his version of No Doubt's [...] "Simple Kind of Life", but he was unable to finish the song. He later asked Stefani if she wanted to co-write lyrics. During a studio session together, they finished [...] "Cool" [...] in 15 minutes. Stefani commented, [...] "When he told me about the track and where it came from for him, it just triggered something in me." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] reflect Stefani's former relationship with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal. Although their romantic relationship ended, the lyrics portray Stefani's attitude that it is [...] "cool" [...] that they still remain very good friends. Stefani and Kanal's relationship had provided the inspiration for No Doubt's [...] "Don't Speak" [...] (1996), and while [...] "Cool" [...] presents an amicable friendship between former lovers, [...] "Don't Speak" [...] is about a failing relationship and never arrives at a solution for the couple. Stefani said that she had never intended to include [...] "personal" [...] material on Love. Angel. Music. Baby., and commented, [...] "but no matter what you do, things <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out.</b> It just ended this whole thing for me in my head, and it puts an end to a chapter in a really nice way."

500|$|Carey wrote [...] "Mine Again" [...] {{alongside}} producer James Poyser. The ballad has {{electronic keyboard}} notes, a rhythmic vinyl sound, and melodies from gospel and R genres. [...] "Stay the Night" [...] {{was produced by}} Carey and Kanye West, and samples a piano loop from Ramsey Lewis's 1971 cover version of [...] "Betcha by Golly, Wow". In the lyrics, the protagonist faces the dilemma of spending the night with an ex-lover, although he is in another relationship. [...] "Get Your Number" [...] samples the hook from British band Imagination's 1982 single [...] "Just an Illusion", and derives its production from [...] "'80s-esque synthesizers" [...] and computerized musical instruments. Lawrence Ferber from the Windy City Times described [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a [...] "playful approach to bitterness—and, more specifically, a cheatin' bad apple", with lyrics such as [...] "I gotta shake you off / Just like a Calgon commercial". In an interview with Ferber, Carey described the track as her favorite from The Emancipation of Mimi: [...] "'Shake It Off' can apply to anything. Whatever personal dramas we go through, put that song on and you lose the anxiety or intensity of the moment. I'll listen to that song when I've <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of an annoying meeting. I gotta shake this off." [...] Editor Jon Pareles from The New York Times felt that the album follows a formula that was most apparent on [...] "Shake It Off": [...] "On this album, the verses stay in a narrow range, the choruses glide higher, and {{at the ends of}} some songs, Ms. Carey gives herself a few of her old sky-high notes as a background flourish." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Shake It Off" [...] was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine picked [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a top pick from the album. Michael Paoletta, writing for Billboard, gave the song a positive review, complimenting its lyrics, production and Carey's vocals. He concluded his review with his assurance that the song would be a success, writing [...] "After 'We Belong Together' {{brought her back to}} radio big time, 'Shake It Off' will take Carey's good fortune to the next step." [...] Some critics compared the song heavily to Usher's material from his 2004 album, Confessions. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote [...] "Mariah too heavily bites on the styles of her successors: Usher by way of Dupri on 'Shake It Off'," [...] while Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song was [...] "Usher-lite". Lawrence Ferber from the Windy City Times described [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a [...] "standout" [...] track from the album. When discussing the track with Ferber, Carey described the song as her favorite from The Emancipation of Mimi: [...] "Shake it off can apply to anything.

I'll listen to that song when I've <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of an annoying meeting. I gotta shake this off."
