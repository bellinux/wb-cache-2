5|$|The 502nd <b>Engineer</b> Company {{became the}} first V Corps company-sized unit to return for a second tour in Iraq when it {{deployed}} in September 2004. The company returned to Hanau in September 2005. In December 2004, the 130th <b>Engineer</b> Brigade's headquarters was informed {{that it would be}} deployed back to Iraq the next year. The brigade mobilized and began this new deployment in September 2005; it began operating in the country the next month. The 54th <b>Engineer</b> Battalion followed in October. The brigade eventually replaced the 130th, 194th, and 20th <b>Engineer</b> Brigades, becoming the only <b>engineer</b> brigade operating in the country. By December 2006, the brigade commanded all engineering formations in Multi-National Corps - Iraq, including engineers from other branches of the US Military, for a total of 3,300 soldiers.

5|$|A monstrous, mutated Fifield {{returns to}} the Prometheus and kills several crew members before he is killed. The Prometheus captain, Janek, speculates that the {{structure}} was an <b>Engineer</b> military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the <b>Engineer</b> from stasis and speaks to him {{in an attempt to}} explain what Weyland wants. The <b>Engineer</b> responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the <b>Engineer</b> is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the Prometheus into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process, while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, killing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw that the <b>Engineer</b> is pursuing her. The <b>Engineer</b> forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer; it thrusts an ovipositor down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains, and with his help, launches another <b>Engineer</b> spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity.|$|E
