This study involves over three hundred subdivisions in Iskandar Malaysia. The <b>housing</b> <b>densities</b> were determined through ArcGis software while CommunityViz software was used to determine the amount of travel carbon emission. The findings indicate that most of Iskandar Malaysia’s subdivisions do not meet the preferred design standards for carbon reduction and can contribute to higher carbon emission. The design of these subdivisions focuses more on its aesthetic aspects rather than being functional and sustainable. However, this is only looking at the travel minimisation aspect of the design though it is not a minimal aspect itself...|$|R

40|$|Aerial and {{satellite}} imagery {{is being investigated}} {{in the state of}} Michigan as a possible supplement in the measurement of lakeshore development features such as <b>house</b> <b>density,</b> dock density, and armored shoreline percent, which are shown to have negative impacts on lake ecosystems. I evaluated the feasibility of using aerial imagery to measure armored shoreline percent by comparing imagery derived estimates of armored shoreline percent with field sampled values from a set of lakes in Michigan and determined that the measurements were comparable. I then performed statistical analyses on a sample of 210 Michigan lakes stratified by three regions to determine relationships between armored shoreline percent, <b>house</b> <b>density,</b> dock density, lake area, and region. Results of the analyses showed that both armored shoreline percent and dock <b>density</b> increased with <b>house</b> <b>density.</b> Region was found to affect dock density. Armored shoreline percent increased with lake area only for lakes larger than 2 km 2, with no relationship in smaller lakes. I then evaluated the usage of aerial images in counting shoreline features using a subset of 50 lakes and the same stratification. Counts for the three features were made using computer software, and statistical analysis was performed between the image estimates and field counts. Region was found to affect the <b>house</b> <b>density</b> image estimates. A majority of the image estimates for <b>house</b> <b>density</b> and armored shoreline percent had accuracies above 90 % (considering field values as correct), while estimates for dock density had significantly lower accuracies. There was a 95 % probability that an image estimate for <b>house</b> <b>density</b> was within 3. 46 units/km of the value obtained from a field sample, an image estimate for dock density was within 10. 08 units/km of the value obtained from a field sample, and an image estimate for armored shoreline percent was within 0. 33 units of the value obtained from a field sample. Total time spent on the image estimates was 37. 50 hours for one person, compared with 98. 76 hours for the field samples, which required a crew of two people.

'Broadacre City', Frank Lloyd Wright's proposal {{from the early}} 1930 s, for example, was several thousand times less dense than the Liverpool docks {{had been in the}} middle of the previous century. What <b>housing</b> <b>densities</b> should we aim for? The determinants of <b>housing</b> <b>densities</b> can be thought of as either internal or external to habitation. The former concern the space households acquire or are allocated to satisfy the functions or desires of habitation; the latter are those forces, external to habitation, which influence density, such as the provision of public transport, the profit seeking behavior of developers or government policy to slow urban spread. I begin with some brief reminders of how in the recent past when urban compaction theory or practice has been in the ascendancy (internal) considerations of habitation have not been given due weight. Is this the case again? I compare a sample of higher <b>density</b> <b>housing</b> types and schemes in Brisbane with Copenhagen, a denser city admired by compact city advocates.

The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial arrangement of 3 x 2 with three nutritional plans (3, 4 and 5 phases) and two <b>housing</b> <b>densities</b> (2 and 3 birds/m 2) with four replicates. The ducks had weekly performance evaluations, and after 90 days, four birds in each treatment were slaughtered for evaluation of carcass traits. Differences (p< 0. 05) were observed on performance, carcass traits and economic analysis. The nutritional plans with 3 phases showed better results for feed intake and weight gain, as well as provided lower total cost production and higher operating profit. Ducks in higher densities showed smaller feed intake, weight gain, higher pro-ventricle weight and better results for total meet production, crude income and operating profit. In summary, nutritional plans with reduced phases (3 phases) and extensions of energy-protein relationships showed better results for ducks on performance and carcass traits in densities of 3 birds/m². More studies are necessary to determine other nutritional requirements for ducks in housing for a better nutritional and management control...|$|R
