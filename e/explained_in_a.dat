Beebe eventually helped Elswyth purchase a small farm near Wilmington, Vermont, where he visited her frequently.

25|$|Romney’s initial {{emergency}} {{budget proposal}} {{for fiscal year}} 2003 called for $343 million in immediate funding cuts, necessitating layoffs of state employees and cuts in aid to cities and towns for public safety and education. He <b>explained</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> televised address, “There's no time to restructure state government or remake state programs. On such an emergency timetable, there's just time for cuts.” He also proposed cuts in state expenditures for Medicaid, the government program providing {{health care for the}} poorest state residents. The cuts included caps in payments to medical providers (one example being through limiting payments for hospital stays to 20 days, no matter how sick the patient), increased stringency of the criteria for Medicaid eligibility, and rationing of access to higher-priced medications for Medicaid patients. Some 36,000 Massachusetts residents lost their Medicaid eligibility. The 2003 emergency budget revision proposal also included funding cuts affecting public colleges and universities, treatment for schizophrenic and other mentally ill patients, and various other social services.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} this, a not legally sanctioned {{referendum}} was held as scheduled, with over 80% voting for independence, albeit {{on a low}} turnout of around 40%. Independence parties considered the result a success. Artur Mas <b>explained</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> public act on 25 November his plan to reach independence, proposing calling an extraordinary regional election—turned into an alternative vote on independence—at some point during 2015, {{on the condition that}} ERC agreed to join a common list with his party to stand together at the polls. ERC leader Oriol Junqueras agreed with most of the plan but initially refused such a joint list, threatening to break its government pact with CiU in order to force an election in early 2015. After weeks of calibrated brinkmanship from both sides, with CDC pushing for a joint candidature to cover for its forecasted loss of support and ERC refusing to run with Artur Mas as presidential candidate, both parties finally reached an agreement, and on 14 January 2015, Mas announced that a snap regional election would be held on 27 September that same year, with the intention to turn in into the true plebiscite on independence.|$|E
