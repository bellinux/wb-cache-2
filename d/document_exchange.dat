40|$|In today’s {{business}} world, enterprises are {{not only}} using Web Services for implementing B 2 Bi. Instead, AS 2 for realizing Internet based EDI, ebXML Messaging and even SMTP and FTP are used for <b>exchanging</b> business <b>documents.</b> Harmo-nizing B 2 Bi communication technology {{in a way that}} solely uses Web Services is barely an option for large enterprises as this would result in losing investments in existing IT systems. Moreover, forcing a specific communication technology upon all business partners is neither intended nor realistic in practice. At the same time, existing business <b>document</b> <b>exchanges</b> frequently only implement B 2 Bi scenarios partly. This paper focuses on a method for composing existing and new business <b>document</b> <b>exchanges</b> without replacing com-munication technology already in use. First, ebXML BPSS is proposed for describing the choreography of business <b>document</b> <b>exchanges</b> in a technology agnostic way. Second, ebXML CPPA is used to define messaging characteristics at the level of ebBP BusinessTransactions. Third, an integration architecture for performing ebXML BPSS choreographies using BPEL processes that execute each integration part-ner’s message exchanges is proposed. These BPEL processes assume Web service wrappers for reusing the functionality of messaging systems that are responsible for performing the actual business <b>document</b> <b>exchanges</b> and for providing sufficient status information to the caller. Different messag-ing systems then can be used for incorporating variable communication technologies in business collaborations...|$|R

40|$|In {{business-to-business}} e-commerce, traditional {{electronic data}} interchange (EDI) approaches such as UN/EDIFACT have been superseded by approaches like web services and ebXML. Nevertheless, a precise and common semantic definition of business <b>documents</b> <b>exchanged</b> is needed. In order to become independent from a transfer syntax, we prefer defining the documents as platform independent models. An approach that follows this idea is the UN/CEFACT’s core component standard. Core components are reusable semantic building blocks which can be combined in various ways to create shared libraries of interoperable business documents. In order to use standard UML modeling tools we have developed a UML profile for the core components standard. Furthermore, we adapt the UN/CEFACT naming and design rules for the UML profile in order to derive XML schemas for business <b>document</b> <b>exchanges.</b> The overall approach is demonstrated by using a specific example {{from the field of}} e-commerce. ...|$|R
