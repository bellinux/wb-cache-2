50|$|The {{summary of}} the {{investigation}} said the testing results for the VZ-5 were not favorable:The investigation showed that the airplane was unstable over the speed range {{and could not be}} trimmed about the actual center of gravity at 0.64 chord for the low speed. In order to provide a reasonable degree of longitudinal stability for the basic airplane configuration and a bare capability of trim over the flap deflection range, it would be necessary to ballast the airplane to move the center of gravity far ahead of its actual location. About 700 pounds of weight added to the cockpit area would be necessary to move the center of gravity the required amount. The airplane can develop a hovering lift of about 4,000 pounds which is approximately equal to its weight. The airplane had very high <b>effective</b> <b>dihedral</b> which, coupled with the certain directional instabilities, would be expected to produce highly undesirable flying qualities.”Since the VZ-5 was only ground and wind tunnel tested, exactly how those “undesirable flying qualities” would have become manifest in test fights never became known.|$|E

The {{first part of the}} paper discusses the changes in design parameters when the blades are swept, while the second part throws light on the effect of sweep on tip leakage flow-related phenomena. 15 domains are studied with 5 sweep configurations (0 &#x 2218;, 20 &#x 2218; TCS, 30 &#x 2218; TCS, 20 &#x 2218; AXS, and 30 &#x 2218; AXS) and for 3 tip clearances (0. 0 &# 37;, 0. 7 &# 37;, and 2. 7 &# 37; of the blade chord). A commercial CFD package is employed for the flow simulations and analysis. Results are well validated with experimental data. Forward sweep reduced the flow incidences. This is true all over the span with axial sweeping while little higher incidences below the mid span are observed with tip chordline sweeping. Sweeping is observed to lessen the flow turning. AXS rotors demonstrated more efficient energy transfer among the rotors. Tip chordline sweep deflected the flow towards the hub while <b>effective</b> positive <b>dihedral</b> induced with axial sweeping resulted in outward deflection of flow streamlines.

"Recent {{flight test}} {{experience}} and simulator {{studies have shown}} that the traditional test for static lateral stability, the steady heading sideslip, in some cases may be overly conservative and place unnecessary restrictions on the aircraft operation or design. In addition, <b>effective</b> <b>dihedral</b> need not be positive in all areas of the flight envelope to provide acceptable handling qualities. Positive static lateral stability is desired so that the aircraft will be safe and that the airplane handling characteristics will be "pleasant. " The safety requirement stems from a desire for redundancy in the primary control system. However, safety analysis of modern aircraft often show this redundancy without <b>effective</b> <b>dihedral</b> through other means such as aileron trim, roll spoilers, etc. In terms of handling characteristics, positive static lateral stability usually provides for a more favorable rating of flying qualities by pilots. However, tests have shown that acceptable handling qualities are obtained in most areas of the flight envelope even with negative <b>effective</b> <b>dihedral.</b> Development flight testing on recent business jet aircraft have shown that the aircraft can be operated safely without use of the primary roll control system, even though the basic aircraft did not pass the traditional steady heading sideslip test in all configurations.

The wing had an aspect ratio of 4, taper ratio of 0. 5, 35 deg sweepback of the 0. 25 -chord line, and a modified NACA 65 A 006 airfoil section at the root and a modified NACA 65 A 004 airfoil section at the tip. The fuselage has been indented in the region of the wing in order to obtain a favorable area distribution. The results reported herein consist of the performance and of the static longitudinal and lateral stability and control characteristics of the complete model. The Mach number range extended from 0. 60 to 1. 13, and the corresponding Reynolds number based on the wing mean aerodynamic chord varied from 1. 77 x 10 (exp 6) to 2. 15 x 10 (exp 6). The drag rise for both the cambered leading edge and symmetrical wing sections occurred at a Mach number of 0. 95.

However, the occurrence of the leading edge vortex flow may be postponed with leading edge devices. Of the devices considered, the most promising were a simple leading edge deflection of 30 deg and a leading edge slat system. The trailing edge flap effectiveness was found to be essentially the same for the configuration employing either of these more promising leading edge devices.
