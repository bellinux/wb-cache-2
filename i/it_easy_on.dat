During filming, {{the cast and crew}} {{made it a point to}} take <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> Danielle Harris, as she was only a young child at the time, and made sure that she was not scared too badly and knew that none of it was real; to this end, Wilbur regularly removed the mask in front of her in order to remind her that it was just a movie and he was not going to hurt her.|$|E
500|$|Triggered by {{the death}} of Krusty's father, Lisa becomes obsessed with {{protecting}} her own father, [...] Homer, from getting hurt. She wraps him in bubble wrap, which ends up saving his life when Otto's school bus plows into the garden. Eventually Marge and Bart talk some sense into Lisa, that while it is nice of her to be concerned for her father, she should not force Homer to take <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> himself and just let him live his life.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} two new {{characters in}} Gibson Praise, played by Jeff Gulka, and Diana Fowley, portrayed by Mimi Rogers. Kim Manners later said of Gulka, [...] "There {{was something about}} that kid's personality that really came off on screen. He really exuded an intelligence that was pretty special. Chris saw what Bob Goodwin did {{with him and he}} knew that this kid was a special storytelling tool for the chronicle of the X-Files". Chris Carter said that Fowley [...] "was a character you were destined to hate because she was a competitor for Mulder's affection with Scully. Gillian Anderson said, [...] "She didn't make <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> Scully. I think she was aware of her effect on Mulder and on the situation." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, in {{the same}} discussion, Straczynski also {{mentions}} that, [...] "I didn't show a kiss because, in my experience, <b>it's</b> <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> all around if one steps into the shallow {{end of the pool}} first, and walks into the deep end rather than diving in and splashing everybody in the process." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked how}} she felt about the storyline, Palmer commented: [...] "It would be {{brilliant}} if it helped somebody.

According to Australian music {{journalist}} Ed Nimmervoll, Nelson's presence was [...] "adding to the problems within" [...] the band; Nimmervoll opined that Goble [...] "agitated within the band to replace Glenn Shorrock with John Farnham." ...|$|E
2500|$|The longarm {{quilting}} machine makes <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> {{to make larger}} quilts because of the extended arm that is used. Being able to leverage the larger machine and not having to hold the material {{that is being used}} while quilting helps the process move along much faster and makes <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> the quilter. Some quilt shops offer longarm services, where one can pay for their project to be quilted and in some cases, bound as well.|$|R

5000|$|Jones {{entered the}} 1968 NORRA Mexican 1000 (now Baja 1000). Jones led until the 150 mi marker. The Off-road Motorsports Hall of Fame {{describes}} Jones' racing style: [...] "Jones and Stroppe {{had to find}} a way to keep their vehicles in one piece. During races Jones would push the vehicles at maximum speeds until they gave way, with Stroppe telling him at top volume the entire time to take <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> the vehicle." ...|$|R
2500|$|As a performer, Goble was {{responsible}} for the vocal arrangements and high harmonies on eleven studio albums and numerous Top 10 singles with LRB.

As a producer, Goble's credits include John Farnham's Uncovered album in 1980 and his own catalog of recordings.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "So...did that really just happen? Once Upon a Time has taken <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> the {{character}} deaths (well, {{at least the}} major ones) in recent times, but “Firebird” suggests this might really be the last we see of the man who, for the most part, is the show's de facto romantic lead.

2500|$|... "Satisfaction" [...] was not {{immediately}} released by Decca Records in Great Britain. Decca {{was already in the}} process of preparing a live Rolling Stones EP for release, so the new single did not come out in Britain until 20 August, with [...] "The Spider and the Fly" [...] on the B-side. The song peaked at number one for two weeks, replacing Sonny & Cher's [...] "I Got You Babe", between 11 and 25 September, before being toppled by the Walker Brothers' [...] "Make <b>It</b> <b>Easy</b> <b>on</b> Yourself".|$|E

What Xar must do is allow Haplo to die, and then revive him with necromancy. The fact that they both know it and accept it does not make <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> either of them. Haplo dies peacefully, as Xar, Lord of the Nexus, the most powerful human being in the universe, weeps silently over his surrogate son, whom, despite everything, he still loves.|$|R
2500|$|Warwick {{was signed}} to Bacharach's and David's {{production}} company, according to Warwick, {{which in turn}} was signed to Scepter Records in 1962 by Greenberg. The partnership would provide Bacharach with the freedom to produce Warwick without the control of recording company executives and company A men. Warwick's musical ability and education would also allow Bacharach to compose more challenging tunes. The demo version of [...] "It's Love That Really Counts", along with her original demo of [...] "Make <b>It</b> <b>Easy</b> <b>on</b> Yourself", would surface on Warwick's debut Scepter album, Presenting Dionne Warwick, which was released in early 1963.|$|E
2500|$|Vandersloot {{became a}} {{basketball}} star at Kentwood High School in her hometown. Her coach, Keith Hennig, a former player at Central Washington University who is 6inches taller than Vandersloot, regularly played one-on-one against her either {{before or after}} the team's practice. He would later say, [...] "I did not take <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> her at all. I was more physical than anything she's ever been used to. At times, I wasn't too nice. I would ride her and foul her. I'd put my hand in her face and she would whine and complain about fouls. I'd say, 'There's no fouls out here.' [...] " [...] She eventually reached the point where she regularly beat her coach off the dribble.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1962, Scepter Records {{released}} her first solo single, [...] "Don't Make Me Over", {{the title of}} which (according to the A Biography of Dionne Warwick) Warwick supplied herself when she snapped the phrase at producers Burt Bacharach and Hal David in anger. Warwick had found out that [...] "Make <b>It</b> <b>Easy</b> <b>on</b> Yourself" [...] — a song on which she had recorded the original demo and {{had wanted to be}} her first single release — had been given to another artist, Jerry Butler. [...] From the phrase [...] "don't make me over", Bacharach and David created their first top 40 pop hit (#21) and a top 5 U.S. R hit. Warrick's name was misspelled on the single's label, and she began using the new spelling (i.e., [...] "Warwick") both professionally and personally.|$|E
5000|$|In the past, the groom's {{mother might}} not {{take part in}} the {{procession}} as a sign that she would not be a threat to the future bride; she would even [...] "hide" [...] for a short period upon the bride's welcoming to the groom's home. However, this practice has long been abandoned. The number of people participating in the groom's procession varies but is usually restricted to a smaller number (20 or so) to make <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> the bride's family, which must receive all the guests.|$|R
50|$|The {{team did}} gain some notoriety during the season. The NFL {{tried to make}} <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> teams after playing a Monday night game by giving every team that was away for a Monday night game either a home game or their bye week the {{following}} week. The Steelers were the only team that season {{to play on the}} road following a Monday night road game, playing the San Francisco 49ers at Candlestick Park on November 17 before traveling to Cleveland the following week to play against the rival Cleveland Browns on November 23.|$|R

2500|$|Some {{found it}} hard to believe that the punch could have floored a man like Liston. Hall of Fame {{announcer}} Don Dunphy said, [...] "Here was a guy who was in prison and the guards used to beat him over the head with clubs and couldn't knock him down." [...] But others contend that he wasn't the same Liston. Dave Anderson of the New York Times said Liston [...] "looked awful" [...] in his last workout before the fight. Liston's handlers secretly paid sparring partner Amos Lincoln an extra $100 to take <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>on</b> him. Arthur Daley of the New York Times wrote that Liston's handlers knew he [...] "didn't have it anymore." [...] These comments don't accord with the fact that Liston easily beat Amos Lincoln three years later in 1968, knocking him out inside two rounds.|$|E
2500|$|The single [...] "Do You Know the Way to San Jose?", an {{international}} million seller and a Top 10 hit in several countries, including the UK, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Japan and Mexico, {{was also a}} double-sided hit with the [...] "B" [...] side [...] "Let Me Be Lonely" [...] charting at #79. More hits followed into 1971, including [...] "Who Is Gonna Love Me" [...] (#32, 1968) with [...] "B" [...] side, [...] "(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me" [...] becoming another double-sided hit; [...] "Promises, Promises" [...] (#19, 1968); [...] "This Girl's in Love with You" [...] (#7, 1969); [...] "The April Fools" [...] (#37, 1969); [...] "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" [...] (#15, 1969); [...] "I'll Never Fall in Love Again" [...] (#6, 1969); [...] "Make <b>It</b> <b>Easy</b> <b>on</b> Yourself" [...] (#37, 1970); [...] "Who Is Gonna Love Me" [...] (#33, 1968); [...] "Let Me Go to Him" [...] (#32, 1970); and [...] "Paper Mache" [...] (#43, 1970).

50|$|Many {{types of}} {{shampoos}} and conditioners formulated for dogs are available; however, using a shampoo without mixing {{it with water}} {{may be a bit}} strong for a dog that's just getting a touch-up bath. If the dog needs a bath, shampoo should be mixed with cold or hand-warm water in the manufacturers recommended ratio to make <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>on</b> the dog and to make sure it rinses entirely. If any shampoo remains on the dog after the bath, it may become irritating to the skin. Most dogs do not require frequent bathing; shampooing a coat too often can strip the coat of its natural oils, causing it to dry out.|$|R
