5|$|In 1964, VAT {{had started}} to seek a {{stronger}} partner when it negotiated with AB Scania-Vabis. The companies planned to use Scania engines in Vanaja vehicles but the plan proved too expensive for VAT. This may have led the major owners of VAT to start discussions about merging VAT and SAT. The chairman of VAT held regular meetings with the SAT manager Tor Nessling. In 1967, AB Scania-Vabis expressed its interest in VAT and German company Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG was interested in co-operation with, or acquisition of, VAT. Valmet is also rumoured to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in VAT {{but there is no}} evidence of concrete negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> {{in the ditch}} since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit {{excavated}} sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, {{in an attempt to}} determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E

5|$|Hancock was {{put forth}} as a {{candidate}} in the 1789 U. S. presidential election. As was the custom in an era where political ambition was viewed with suspicion, Hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in the office; he instead made his wishes known indirectly. Like everyone else, Hancock knew that George Washington {{was going to be}} elected as the first president, but Hancock may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in being vice president, despite his poor health. Hancock received only four electoral votes in the election, however, none of them from his home state; the Massachusetts electors all voted for another Massachusetts native, John Adams, who received the second-highest number of electoral votes and thus became vice president. Although Hancock was disappointed with his performance in the election, he continued to be popular in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in proteinuria, the excess of protein in human urine, {{as an indicator of}} kidney disease. To better understand the etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E

25|$|Matthew's idea {{on society}} were radical for their times. Although {{he was a}} landowner, he was {{involved}} with the Chartist movement, and argued that institutions of hereditary nobility were detrimental to society. It {{has been suggested that}} these views worked against acceptance of his theory of natural selection, being politically incorrect at the time (see Barker, 2001). The more likely reason is that the obscurity of the location hid the ideas from many who would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested.</b> Only after Darwin's Origin did Matthew come forward in a popular journal, the Gardeners' Chronicle. Matthew also published a book in 1839, Emigration Fields (Black, Edinburgh), suggesting that overpopulation, as predicted by Malthus, could be solved by mass migration to North America and the Dominions.|$|E

Perrault senior, however, was known for some time to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in contes de veille or contes de ma mère l'oye, and in 1693 published a versification of [...] "Les Souhaits Ridicules" [...] and, in 1694, a tale with a Cinderella theme called [...] "Peau d'Ane". Further, a handwritten and illustrated manuscript of five of the tales (including Le Maistre Chat ou le Chat Botté) existed two years before the tale's 1697 Paris publication. Pierre Darmancour was sixteen or seventeen {{years old at the time}} the manuscript was prepared and, as scholars Iona and Peter Opie note, quite unlikely to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in recording fairy tales. Darmancour, who became a soldier, showed no literary inclinations, and, when he died in 1700, his obituary made no mention of any connection with the tales.
