He said: [...] "I wanted {{this to be a}} modern honky-tonk record, but not one that's a 'cry in your beer' honky-tonk record: more like a honky-tonk record that Buck Owens would've made". He wanted to make a record that's [...] "everything he loves about country music, in a modern sense with some new technology". He added that [...] "the record is a largely positive take on life right now. It's got this sentiment of, 'well, things aren't perfect, but it's Friday'".|$|E

[...] "I was playing with the posters, cutting them up" [...] (he carried a razor used at work) and discovered that unlike the cardboard posters in the subway trains, the advertising posters on the subway platforms were printed on a self-adhesive material that could be stuck back down after being torn or cut out. He began to play with available images and text to create humorous [...] "mash-ups" [...] of advertisements. In 2008 alone, he has created over 200 manipulated underground posters in NYC subway. He compares the creation of poster [...] "mash-ups" [...] to hip hop [...] "freestyling" [...] on a microphone. He does not have preconceived notions of what the work will be ("I don't have anything planned…go there, see something, <b>get</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>and</b> do the work"), but uses the available images, often in a way that relates to current events. One commentator noted: [...] "The pieces generally have a critical edge to them, making comments on the state of society and on the advertisements themselves." [...] This can be explicitly political (as his pieces on Sean Bell, [...] "IRAN = NAM", [...] "Obama Drama," [...] and Gaza), or a more general send up of celebrity and corporate culture.|$|E

The objective of this work is to find a way, how it is possible to use spatial data from these projects and how to visualise them. The content of this work is detailed comparison of structure, accessibility, description of spatial features and extensiveness of both database projects. The thesis further explains the specificities connected with spatial data in those databases and offers an example, how to use the data in a cartographic application. In the example application are present two queries in the SPARQL language, which one allows to find and display a) cities with female mayor and b) birthplaces of Nobel prize laureates, in the map window. The code of this application is open source, hence anyone can <b>get</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>and</b> adapt the application for one’s purpose...|$|E

40|$|The author {{analyzes}} creative processes {{underway in}} architecture, particularly, {{at the stage}} of design. The author considers the psychology of choice of a source of artistic images, their transformation {{in the course of}} design, development of an architectural concept based on comparison of options, and use of metaphors. The role of such psychological features of a creative personality as associative thinking, imagination, ability to <b>get</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>and</b> critical assessment is demonstrated and analyzed in the article. General issues of transformation of the habitat of cities, psychological aspects of a conflict between old and new buildings are considered. The present-day design practice is a less creative process that the practice of the past, as the employment of information technologies accelerates drafting of documents and limits the involvement of creativity. The seeming simplicity of information technologies reduces architecture to the craft available to any “user”. As a result, the urban environment is filled with computer design, or ambitious and fake buildings. The psychology of creativity relies on associative thinking, imagination and esthetic sensitivity. The purpose of any creative process is achieved through attainment of the following sequence of objectives:arrangement of preconditions for development of an artistic image; search for sources of inspiration; availability of the input material possessing esthetic potential;use of mechanisms of associative thinking, intensification of figurativeness of the primary source using metaphors, so that the metamorphoses separated the new image from its original source;professional completion of work. The author proves that any creative process is based on comparisons, and associations serving as the basis for operations that consolidate into a creative process represent a psychological tool used by creative personalities. Проанализована последовательность творческого процесса в архитектуре и дизайне на проектной стадии: психология выбора источника художественного образа, его трансформации в ходе проектирования, создание архитектурной концепции на основе сопоставления вариантов, использования метафор и гиперболизации. Показана роль таких психологических качеств креативной личности, как ассоциативное мышление, воображение, способность к озарению и критической оценке художественных достоинств произведения. Рассмотрены общие вопросы преобразования сложившейся среды обитания городов, психологические аспекты конфликта старой и новой застройки...|$|E

Many studies {{have been published in}} the areas of colour applications in interior design; in this paper we are concerned with the initial design process, colour scheming and choices form an important step that any interior designer must pass through whether it is placed at their very early stages or later. Fifteen interior designers with varied professional backgrounds, but based in the Middle East (mainly the Arabian Gulf region), were interviewed. The results showed that the interior design process commonly involve a number of non-sequential steps including: meeting clients, visiting sites, programming, researching, sketching, building concepts, <b>getting</b> <b>inspired,</b> drawing (digitally <b>and</b> manually), and choosing colours and materials. In terms of colour, fourteen out of fifteen participants stated that colour thinking and its decision making take place at the early stages of their design processes; eight of fifteen believe that colour takes place in the first step when meeting clients and starting the project. In addition, the study documented 137 terms these designers use while brainstorming a design project; subsequent analysis of these terms could form a basis for understanding how designers communicate the abstract properties of colour as part of their design processes. Furthermore, designers were asked to choose the most frequent steps that occur during thinking of colour schemes for their designs and score them by importance. The results indicated that "satisfying stated clients requirements" was the most important consideration when thinking of colour schemes...|$|R
