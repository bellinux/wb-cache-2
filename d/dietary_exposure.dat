5|$|When {{taken up}} into the human body from the diet, the 20 {{standard}} amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase; the amino group is then fed into the urea cycle. The other product of transamidation is a keto acid that enters the citric acid cycle. Glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis. Of the 20 standard amino acids, nine (His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp and Val) are called essential amino acids because the human body cannot synthesize them from other compounds at the level needed for normal growth, so they must be obtained from food. In addition, cysteine, taurine, tyrosine, and arginine are considered semiessential amino-acids in children (though taurine is not technically an amino acid), because the metabolic pathways that synthesize these amino acids are not fully developed. The amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual, so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids. <b>Dietary</b> <b>exposure</b> to the non-standard amino acid BMAA has been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS.|$|E

Food and Drug Administration Total Diet Study. The contaminants included in the analysis were four heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury), three organophosphate pesticides (chlorpyrifos, diazinon, malathion), and four organochlorine pesticides (dieldrin, p,p'-DDE, lindane, heptachlor epoxide). <b>Dietary</b> <b>exposures</b> to these contaminants were highly variable among individuals, spanning two to three orders of magnitude. Intraindividual exposures to the metals, organophosphates, and organochlorines were estimated to be strongly correlated; Pearson's correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 28 for lindane:dieldrin to 0. 84 for lead:mercury. For some of the compounds (e. g., arsenic and dieldrin), a substantial fraction of the population was estimated to have dietary intakes in excess of health-based standards established by the EPA. Before use for risk assessment or epidemiologic purposes, however, the validity of the exposure estimates must be evaluated by comparison with biological indicators of chronic exposure. Because of their low detection rate in table-ready foods, the estimated distributions of exposures for dieldrin, p,p'-DDE, heptachlor epoxide, lindane, diazinon, and chlorpyrifos were found to be sensitive to assumed values for nondetect samples. Reliable estimates of the population distribution of <b>dietary</b> <b>exposures</b> to most other contaminants cannot be made currently, due to their low rate of detection in table-ready foods.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Concern exists {{about the}} {{potential}} for low-level exposure to organophosphate pesticides (OPs) to lead to neurological and cognitive health effects. OPs are the most widely used insecticides in American agricultural, and diet is thought to be the primary route by which the general public is exposed to OPs. The United States Department of Agriculture permits food to be certified "organic" when grown according to specific regulations, including prohibitions on the use of most synthetic pesticides. While organic food consumption is known to reduce exposure to OPs, health benefits from choosing organic food have not been demonstrated. We aimed to develop a novel method to assess long-term <b>dietary</b> OP <b>exposure,</b> designed to avoid many of the limitations of the existing methods of OP exposure assessment. Using a combination of individual-level information on dietary intake and national-level data on pesticide residue levels on food items, we estimated long-term <b>dietary</b> OP <b>exposure</b> in a multi-city, multi-ethnic population of over 4, 000 adults. We assessed the face validity of this method by evaluating its comparability with urinary biomonitoring in a subset of participants. Among individuals with conventional diets, increasing tertile of estimated <b>dietary</b> OP <b>exposure</b> was associated with higher urinary metabolite concentrations. We also found that metabolite concentrations were significantly lower in people reporting more frequent consumption of organic produce. We further aimed to better understand the individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics associated with organic food consumption. We observed that women, younger individuals and those with higher education were more likely to consume organic food, and that neighborhood produce availability was also associated with organic food consumption. Our third and final aim was to evaluate the association between the long-term <b>dietary</b> OP <b>exposure</b> we developed and cognitive outcomes, accounting for the individual- and neighborhood-level variables that were associated with organic food consumption. We observed a relationship between increasing <b>dietary</b> OP <b>exposure</b> and decrements in the phonological loop component of working memory, but did not find OP exposure to be associated with three other cognitive endpoints.

40|$|For decades, hazard {{assessments}} {{for environmental}} chemicals have used intra-gastric gavage {{to assess the}} effects of 'oral' exposures. It is now widely used [...] {{and in some cases}} required [...] by US federal agencies to assess potential toxicity of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). In this review we enumerate several reasons why gavage is not appropriate for the assessment of EDCs using bisphenol A (BPA) as a main example. First, whereas human <b>dietary</b> <b>exposures</b> interact with the oral mucosa, gavage exposures avoid these interactions, leading to dramatic differences in absorption, bioavailability and metabolism with implications for toxicokinetic assumptions and models. Additionally, there are well acknowledged complications associated with gavage, such as perforation of the esophagus that diminish its value in toxicological experiments. Finally, the gavage protocol itself can induce stress responses by the endocrine system and confound the assessment of EDCs. These serious flaws have not been taken into account in interpreting results of EDC research. We propose the exploration of alternatives to mimic human exposures when there are multiple exposure routes/sources and when exposures are chronic. We conclude that gavage may be preferred over other routes for some environmental chemicals in some circumstances, but it does not appropriately model human <b>dietary</b> <b>exposures</b> for many chemicals. Because it avoids exposure pathways, is stressful, and thus interferes with endocrine responses, gavage should be abandoned as the default route of administration for hazard assessments of EDCs...|$|R

DESIGN:: A modified diet history method, combining a 7 -day menu book and a 168 -item questionnaire, assessed dietary habits. A standardized questionnaire collected information on sociodemographics, lifestyle and health history. Anthropometric information was obtained through direct measurements. The dietary information was collapsed into 43 generic food groups, and converted into variables indicating the per cent contribution of specific food groups to total energy intake. Food patterns were identified by the QUICK CLUSTER procedure in SPSS, in two separate analytical steps using unstandardized and standardized (Z-scores) clustering variables. SETTING:: The Malmo Diet and Cancer (MDC) Study, a prospective study in the third largest city of Sweden, with baseline examinations from March 1991 to October 1996. SUBJECTS: A random sample of 2206 men and 3151 women from the MDC cohort (n = 28 098).
