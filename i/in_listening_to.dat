5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} <b>in</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|Tkach {{grew up in}} the Russian Orthodox faith, but {{eventually}} his family, including his parents, became interested in the Radio Church of God through the radio broadcast of Herbert W. Armstrong, the founder of the church. The Radio Church of God would eventually change its name in 1968 to the Worldwide Church of God (WCG), the church that Tkach would lead. It was a church characterized by the strong influence of its founder and his unique doctrines based on his own interpretation of the Bible. Initially, Tkach was the only member of his family who was not interested <b>in</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the radio broadcasts. However, a purportedly miraculous event was to change him. At the time, Tkach suffered from severe ulcers and was required to stay on a special diet. His wife then suggested that God would heal him if he were to become a minister in Armstrong's church. Although skeptical, he accepted the suggestion of becoming a minister and he found himself cured, never again to suffer from the ulcers. He was baptized by Radio Church of God minister, Dean Blackwell, on March 1, 1957. On June 7, 1961, Blackwell ordained him a deacon in the Chicago congregation, and on June 3, 1963, Roderick C. Meredith, who would eventually lead a breakaway church from the WCG, ordained him as an elder.|$|E

25|$|After {{more than}} a decade's {{experience}} in the game, Strom was offered a salary contract over 82 games for $16,000 {{for the first time}} by Commissioner Walter Kennedy in August 1969. It was at this time that Strom became interested <b>in</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> what the ABA, which started in 1967, had to offer in the bidding war that ensued between the two leagues over talent. The NBA did not offer benefit plans such as pension, family hospitalization, and long-term disability, which were of importance to Strom and his family. Lured by Borgia, who jumped from the NBA to the ABA to become supervisor of officials, Strom and three other officials—John Vanak, Norm Drucker, and Joe Gushue met with acting ABA Commissioner Jim Gardner during the summer of 1969. The ABA accepted Strom's demands of a $25,000 per year salary, a $25,000 signing bonus, and a health insurance and pension plan. As the four officials left for the ABA in 1969, it brought reform to NBA referees in terms of compensation and benefits. Regular officials in the NBA were offered contracts and salaries increased significantly. Additionally, medical and pension plans were provided for the officials.|$|E

500|$|The booklet, {{along with}} every other album by Korn, does not feature printed lyrics to the songs. The band has {{explained}} that the reason the booklets do not feature this is because Davis believes fans should not rely on printed lyrics because it limits the experience <b>in</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the music. As Davis told MTV's Serena Altschul, [...] "I think music is something that every individual has their own meaning to the song.

500|$|For {{the sixth}} episode, Gonzales spoke about his {{contribution}} to the album. He recalled Daft Punk's visible joy <b>in</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the raw session recordings made early {{in the production of}} the album, as well as the impending years-long challenge that would be faced in completing the record. Gonzales expressed that the duo were aware of how the keys of each song would contribute to the emotional progression of the album as a whole. He therefore performed the piano in the song [...] "Within" [...] to accommodate the cycle. Gonzales concluded by pointing out that Daft Punk rarely collaborate with others, and thus felt that they did so on Random Access Memories to [...] "make the work be transcendent".|$|E
500|$|Mahoney says {{language}} {{serves as}} [...] "a vehicle for corruption", as Dussander tells Bowden horrific {{stories of his}} service at the fictional Death Camp of Patin. Bowden, <b>in</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the stories, becomes [...] "a vampiric extension of the evil" [...] that Dussander exhibits. The sharing of stories lead both Dussander and Bowden to have nightmares, and for Bowden, the nightmares are [...] "a past that is becoming ever more present". One of the key motifs {{of the film is}} that [...] "a door was opened that could not be shut", referring to Dussander's confession about following orders and being unable to hold back. The motif is also conveyed in the scene in which Bowden forces Dussander to put on a Schutzstaffel uniform and to march to Bowden's commands. Dussander continues marching despite Bowden's insistences to stop, emulating the premise of the poem The Sorcerer's Apprentice in which the untrained apprentice uses magic to enchant brooms and lacks the skill to stop them. The scene is [...] "the figurative and literal turning point in the film".|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, I knew there was {{something}} wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't really interested <b>in</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E

Rufus Wainwright was recorded mostly in Los Angeles studiosOcean Way Three & Seven, Sunset Sound Factory, Sunset Sound, Media Vortex, Hook Studios, Groove Masters, Red Zone, Sony, The Palindrome Recorder, and NRG Recording Servicesalthough recording also took place in Marchand's Wild Sky in Morin-Heights, Quebec. Parks conducted his orchestrations at Studio B in the Capitol Studios complex. Wainwright and Brion did not always get along, the latter admitting to The New York Times: [...] "Rufus had all these beautiful songs but every time the vocals would kick in, he'd write some complicated keyboard part so you couldn't hear them. He wasn't interested <b>in</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> ideas about simplifying arrangements." [...] The duo also contributed the songs [...] "Le Roi D'Ys" [...] and [...] "Banks of the Wabash" [...] (both [...] "contemporary" [...] cover versions) to the 1997 soundtrack to the film The Myth of Fingerprints. Brion later considered [...] "Le Roi D'Ys", recorded in around six hours, {{to be one of}} his favorite tracks by Wainwright.|$|E
