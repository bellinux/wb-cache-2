5000|$|High-style Second Empire {{buildings}} {{took their}} ornamental {{cue from the}} Louvre expansion. Typical features include quoins at the corners to define elements, elaborate dormer windows, pediments, brackets, and strong entablatures. There is a clear preference for a variation between rectangular and segmental arched windows; these are frequently enclosed in heavy frames (either arched or rectangular) with sculpted details. Another frequent feature is a strong <b>horizontal</b> <b>definition</b> of the facade, with a strong string course. Particularly high-style examples follow the Louvre precedent by breaking up the facade with superimposed columns and pilasters that typically vary their order between stories. Vernacular buildings typically employed less and more eclectic ornament than high-style specimens that generally followed the vernacular development in other styles.|$|E

It allowed French 819-line programming to squeeze into the 7 MHz VHF broadcast channels used in those neighbouring countries, albeit with a substantial loss of horizontal resolution (408×737 effective, with what would now be considered extra-wide 12:5 aspect ratio pixels); although this still offered approximately twice the actual clarity of 405-line System A (twice the lines, roughly the same <b>horizontal</b> <b>definition),</b> the contrast between vertical and horizontal resolution {{would have made it}} seem perceptually worse.

40|$|Our vision, in this thesis, {{is the one}} of a bio-medical grip as {{a partner}} of hospital's {{information}} systems, sharing computing resources {{as well as a}} platform for sharing information. Therefore, we aim at (i) providing transparent access to huge distributed medical data sets, (ii) querying these data by their content, and (iii), sharing computing resources within the grip. Assuming the existence of a grip infrastructure, we suggest a multi-layered architecture (Distributed Systems Engines – DSE). This architecture allows us to design High Performance Distributed Systems which are highly extensible, scalable and open. It ensures the connection between the grip, data storing systems, and medical platforms. The conceptual design of the architecture assumes a <b>horizontal</b> <b>definition</b> for each one of the layers, and is based on a multi-process structure. This structure enables the exchange of messages between processes by using the Message Passing Paradigm. These processes and messages allow one to define entities of a higher level of semantic significance, which we call Drivers and, which instead of single messages, deal with different kinds of transactions: queries, tasks and requests. Thus, we define different kinds of drivers for dealing with each kind of transaction, and in a higher level, we define services as an aggregation of drivers. The architectural framework of drivers and services eases the design of components of a Distributed System (DS), which we call engines, and also eases the extensibility and scalability of DSLa vision que nous défendons est celle de grilles biomédicales partenaires des systèmes médicaux (hôpitaux), à la fois fournisseuses de puissance de calcul et plates-formes de partage d'informations. Nous proposons une architecture logicielle de partage d'images médicales réparties à grande échelle. S'appuyant sur l'existence a priori d'une infrastructure de grille, nous proposons une architecture multi-couche d'entités logicielles communicantes (DSE : Distributed Systems Engines). Fondée sur une modélisation hiérarchique sémantique, cette architecture permet de concevoir et de déployer des applications réparties performantes, fortement extensibles et ouvertes, capables d'assurer l'interface entre grille, systèmes de stockage de données et plates-formes logicielles locales (propres aux entités de santé) et dispositifs d'acquisition d'images, tout en garantissant à chaque entité une maîtrise complète de ses données dont elle reste propriétair...|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} design flaws have limited the {{effectiveness}} of the scheme. In the initial 2005-07 period, emission caps were not tight enough to drive a significant reduction in emissions. The total allocation of allowances turned out to exceed actual emissions. This drove the carbon price down to zero in 2007. This oversupply was caused because the allocation of allowances by the EU was based on emissions data from the European Environmental Agency in Copenhagen, which uses a <b>horizontal</b> activity-based emissions <b>definition</b> similar to the United Nations, the EU ETS Transaction log in Brussels, but a vertical installation-based emissions measurement system. This caused an oversupply of 200 million tonnes (10% of market) in the EU ETS in the first phase and collapsing prices.|$|R

40|$|Consider a {{stationary}} normal process ξ(t) with mean zero and the covariance function r(t). Properties {{of the sample}} functions {{in the neighborhood of}} zeros, upcrossings of very high levels, etc. have been studied by, among others, Kac and Slepian, 1959 [4] and Slepian, 1962 [11]. In this paper we shall study the sample functions near local maxima of height u, especially as u → -∞, and mainly use similar methods as [4] and [11]. Then it is necessary to analyse carefully what is meant by "near a maximum of height u. " In Section 2 we derive the "ergodic" definition, i. e. the definition which is possible to interpret by the aid of relative frequencies in a single realisation. This definition has been treated previously by Leadbetter, 1966 [5], and {{it turns out to be}} related to Kac and Slepian's <b>horizontal</b> window <b>definition.</b> In Section 3 we give a representation of ξ(t) near a maximum as the difference between a non-stationary normal process and a deterministic process, and in Section 4 we examine these processes as u → -∞. We have then to distinguish between two cases. A: Regular case. r(t) = 1 -λ 2 t 2 / 2 + λ 4 t 4 / 4 ! - λ 6 t 6 / 6 ! + o(t 6) as t → 0, where the positive λ 2 k are the spectral moments. Then it is proved that if ξ(t) has a maximum of height u at t = 0 then, as u → -∞, eginalign* (lambda_ 2 lambda_ 6 - lambda_ 4 ^ 2) (lambda_ 4 - lambda_ 2 ^ 2) ^- 1 xi((lambda_ 2 lambda_ 6 - lambda_ 4 ^ 2) ^-frac 12 (lambda_ 4 - lambda_ 2 ^ 2) ^frac 12 t|u|^- 1) - u sim |u|^- 3 t^ 4 / 4 ! + omega(lambda_ 4 - lambda_ 2 ^ 2) ^frac 12 lambda_ 2 ^ -frac 12 t^ 3 / 3 ! - zeta(lambda_ 4 - lambda_ 2 ^ 2) lambda_ 2 ^- 1 t^ 2 / 2 endalign* where ω and ζ are independent random variables (rv), ω has a standard normal distribution and ζ has the density z exp (-z), z > 0. Thus, in the neighborhood of a very low maximum the sample functions are fourth degree polynomials with positive t 4 -term, symmetrically distributed t 3 -term, and a negatively distributed t 2 -term but without t-term. B: Irregular case. r(t) = 1 - λ 2 t 2 / 2 + λ 4 t 4 / 4 ! - λ 5 |t| 5 / 5 ! + o(t 5) as t → 0, where λ 5 > 0. Now ξ(tu - 2) - u ∼ |u| - 5 λ 2 λ 5 (λ 4 - λ 2 2) - 1 |t| 3 / 3 ! + (2 λ 5) 1 / 2 ω(t) - ζ(λ 4 - λ 2 2) λ 2 - 1 t 2 / 2 where ω(t) is a non-stationary normal process whose second derivative is a Wiener process, independent of ζ which has the density z exp (-z), z > 0. The term λ 5 |t| 5 / 5 ! "disturbs" the process in such a way that the order of the distance which can be surveyed is reduced from 1 /|u| (in Case A) to 1 /|u| 2. The results are used in Section 5 to examine the distribution of the wave-length and the crest-to-trough wave-height, i. e., the amplitude, discussed by, among others, Cartwright and Longuet-Higgins, 1956 [1]. One hypothesis, sometimes found in the literature, [10], states that the amplitude has a Rayleigh distribution and is independent of the mean level. According to this hypothesis the amplitude is of the order 1 /|u| as u → -∞ while the results of this paper show that it is of the order 1 /|u| 3...|$|R
40|$|Several {{coastal lagoon}} entrances are {{controlled}} by the contiguous subaerial beach that works as a detrital barrier. Hence the importance of characterizing the adjacent beach morphodynamics regarding the beachface and berm reconstruction for coastal management proposals. The studied area, a subaerial beach sector of 308 m, located {{in front of the}} Melides coastal lagoon, is placed in an embayed sandy coastline at the Portuguese Southwest Atlantic Coast. During one year (April 2010 to April 2011), 26 field surveys were conducted in order to describe the evolution of this subaerial beach sector. The periodicity of the campaigns was defined in order to characterize the effects of storms (pre and post-storm) and tides (spring and neap tides), on subaerial beach morphodynamics adjacent to the lagoon entrance. A survey grid with an alongshore length of 308 m and a width defined between the lower limit of the beachface and the backshore limit (entrance of the coastal lagoon or frontal dune) was used. This grid considered 12 cross-shore profiles apart by 40 m. The alongshore profiles describes the main topographic variations (e. g. top of the beachface, berms elevation, beach cups <b>definition).</b> <b>Horizontal</b> and vertical positioning was provided by Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS. The results allowed the construction of high resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the studied area. This data were used to describe in detail the beach morphologic changes using the ArcGIS software. The superficial beach sediments were also collected pointing to the predominance of coarse to very coarse sand. The nearshore wave characteristics was described by the SWAN wave model considering as boundary conditions wave data recorded at the Sines wave rider buoy. The run-up levels were calculated considering the wave parameters and the beachface slope (0. 12 to 0. 18, tanβ). The results obtained in field campaigns, allow the description of the morphological pattern and morphodynamic evolution of detrital barrier (conceptual model) that separates the lagoon Melides from the sea. It is clear a morphological and morphodynamic cyclic behavior of the detrital barrier, marked by an equilibrium stage characterized by a wide berm (35 m) with a berm elevation of 5 m. This steady state is reached at different times; however it is characterized by the predominance of the wave overtopping process responsible by berm reconstruction.

40|$|The subaerial beache act as detritical {{barriers}} {{in the opening}} and closing of lagoons located in sandy coastal ares. The study of beach morphodynamics, considering {{the evolution of the}} beachface and the berm, in these cases is critical to coastal management. The studied area located in an embayed sandy coastline at the Portuguese Southwest Atlantic Coast, is a 308 m long subaerial, coarse to very coarse, sandy beach adjacent to the Melides lagoon entrance. In order to characterize the morphodynamics of the study area under the effects of storms (pre and post-storm) and tides (spring and neap tides) during a period of one year (April 2010 to April 2011), 26 field surveys were conducted. A survey grid with an alongshore lenght of 308 m and a widht of 14 - 40 m defined between the lower limit of the beachface and the backshore limit (entrance of the coastal lagoon or frontal dune) was used. We performed 12 cross-shore profiles 40 m apart from each other. The alongshore profiles describes the main topographic variations (e. g. top of the beachface, berms elevation, beach cusps <b>definition).</b> <b>Horizontal</b> and vertical positioning was provided by Real-Time Kinematics (RTK) GPS. The results obtained allowed to develop high resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM) using the ArcGIS software. DEM models were use to describe beach morphologicnd changes. The nearshore wave characteristics were described by the SWAN wave model considering as boundary conditions the wave data recorded at the Sines wave rider buoy. The run-up levels were calculated using the wave parameters and the beachface slope (0. 12 to 0. 18). During the study period were documented two episodes of opening and closing of the Melides lagoon due to storms effect, and one artificial opening episode. A conceptual model for the reconstruction of the sandy beach detritical barrier that controls the opening and closing of the lagoon was performed. This study shows that the evolution of the sandy beach detritical barrier is characterized by a cyclical behaviour of recovery marked by the occurrence of storms. The developed conceptual model is characterized by rapid sediment transport between the submarine beach and the beachface. The incidence of more energetic storms (Hs= 5 m) induces the destruction of the sandy beach detritical barrier leaving open the Melides lagoon to the Atlantic Ocean. Due to storms the beach profile is destroyed and about 1. 9 x 10 3 m 3 of sand is remobilized above - 0. 5 m (MSL). Beach recovers much of its original morphology and sediment volume 10 - 12 days after the storm. At the stage of equilibrium, the sandy beach detritical barrier presents a wide berm (35 m), a berm with an elevation close to 5 m (MSL) and a reflective beachface.
