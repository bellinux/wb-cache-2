5|$|Ottawa {{grammatical}} gender classifies nouns as either animate or inanimate. Transitive verbs encode {{the gender of}} the grammatical object, and intransitive verbs encode {{the gender of the}} grammatical subject, creating a set of four verb subclasses. The distinction between the two genders also affects verbs through agreement patterns for number and gender. Similarly, demonstrative pronouns agree <b>in</b> <b>gender</b> with the noun they refer to.|$|E
5|$|Adjectives are inflected in two declensions—{{indefinite}} and definite—and {{they must}} match the noun they modify <b>in</b> <b>gender</b> and number. The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created {{by adding a}} suffix (-t or -a) to the common form of the adjective, e.g., en grön stol (a green chair), ett grönt hus (a green house), and gröna stolar ("green chairs"). The definite form of an adjective {{is identical to the}} indefinite plural form, e.g., den gröna stolen ("the green chair"), det gröna huset ("the green house"), and de gröna stolarna ("the green chairs").|$|E
5|$|Annual {{variations}} in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios {{in favor of}} females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures {{over a three-year period}} produced 87–99% females. This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction. A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings, which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift <b>in</b> <b>gender</b> ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles.|$|E

5|$|Male {{participation}} in feminism is encouraged by feminists and {{is seen as}} an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy <b>in</b> <b>gender</b> relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that both genders can and should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism. It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's agency.|$|E
5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift <b>in</b> <b>gender</b> representation in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's {{enduring}} {{popularity is}} linked to her conflicted public image. On the one hand, she remains a sex symbol, beauty icon {{and one of the}} most famous stars of classical Hollywood cinema. On the other, she is also remembered for her troubled private life, unstable childhood, struggle for professional respect, and her death and the conspiracy theories surrounding it. She has been written about by scholars and journalists interested <b>in</b> <b>gender</b> and feminism, such as Gloria Steinem, Jacqueline Rose, Molly Haskell, Sarah Churchwell, and Lois Banner. Some, such as Steinem, have viewed her as a victim of the studio system. Others, such as Haskell, Rose, and Churchwell, have instead stressed Monroe's proactive role in her career and her participation in the creation of her public persona.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} is rooted <b>in</b> <b>gender</b> inequality, {{attempts to control}} women's sexuality, and ideas about purity, modesty and beauty. It is usually initiated and carried out by women, who {{see it as a}} source of honour, and who fear that failing to have their daughters and granddaughters cut will expose the girls to social exclusion. Health effects depend on the procedure. They can include recurrent infections, difficulty urinating and passing menstrual flow, chronic pain, the development of cysts, an inability to get pregnant, complications during childbirth, and fatal bleeding. There are no known health benefits.|$|E
5|$|Stansfield {{had long}} felt {{uncomfortable with the}} idea of medical {{officers}} marrying. Louise Hind, <b>in</b> <b>Gender</b> and Class in English Asylums, 1890–1914, hints that this might have been the result of misogynist tendencies, although Hubert Bond, his obituary-writer and former colleague, preemptively defended him against these claims. Stansfield nevertheless married twice; firstly, in 1908 to Mary Caroline (died 1926), a daughter of the Hon. James Dever, a Canadian senator from St John's, Newfoundland. After her death, he married (in 1929) Marie, second daughter of Alexander Effremoff, of Moscow; he had met her in Paris, where she had been living in exile after the Russian Revolution. There were no children from either marriage, but he worked with the scouting movement, and served as President of the North Central Kent Boys' Scouts Association. He was a fond rose-grower and it was the gardens at Southmead in Wimbledon which attracted him and his first wife to the house; they lived there for many years. He retired to Castello Devachan in Sanremo, Italy, with his second wife, before going to Paris to seek treatment for an illness; he died there on 19 February 1939. His widow remained at the Castello in Sanremo until her death in 1973, spending her last 21 years as starosta of the Russian Orthodox parish community there.|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{venture into}} modernity brought {{concepts}} of democracy, equality and individual rights. The {{rise of the}} concept of nationalism and introspection of discriminatory practices brought about social reform movements related to caste and gender relations. This first phase of feminism in India was initiated by men to uproot the social evils of sati (widow immolation), to allow widow remarriage, to forbid child marriage, and to reduce illiteracy, as well as to regulate the age of consent and to ensure property rights through legal intervention. In addition to this, some upper caste Hindu women rejected constraints they faced under Brahminical traditions. However, efforts for improving the status of women in Indian society were somewhat thwarted by the late nineteenth century, as nationalist movements emerged in India. These movements resisted 'colonial interventions <b>in</b> <b>gender</b> relations' particularly in the areas of family relations. In the mid to late nineteenth century, there was a national form of resistance to any colonial efforts made to 'modernise' the Hindu family. This included the Age of Consent controversy that erupted after the government tried to raise the age of marriage for women.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name {{manganese}} is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals from Magnesia (located within modern Greece) were both called magnes from their place of origin, but were thought to differ <b>in</b> <b>gender.</b> The male magnes attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as lodestone or magnetite, and which probably gave us the term magnet. The female magnes ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine magnes was later called magnesia, known now in modern times as pyrolusite or manganese dioxide. Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called manganesum (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a magnesia negra (the black ore) from magnesia alba (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). Michele Mercati called magnesia negra manganesa, and finally the metal isolated from it became known as manganese (German: Mangan). The name magnesia eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba (magnesium oxide), which provided the name magnesium for the free element when it was isolated much later.|$|E

There is a relationship between communication style and learning outcome in problem solving. We suggest to further investigate how co-operative problem solving for females <b>in</b> mixed <b>gender</b> groups can be improved...|$|R
50|$|Sztokman's second book, {{written in}} {{collaboration}} with Dr. Chaya Rosenfeld Gorsetman, is an exploration of Orthodox Jewish day schools {{and the ways in}} which schools construct gender identity.

Sztokman told Sara Ivry at Tablet that the book was based on ten years of work, and compiled several different sources of qualitative research, mostly in North America but also in Israel. This book won the 2013 National Jewish Book Council award in Education and Identity, making Sztokman one of only a small group of authors to win this award twice—and it is very rare to win two years in a row.|$|R

40|$|Aims. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{feasibility}} and accuracy of fetal gender assignment by transabdominal ultrasound at 12 – 14 weeks of gestation. Methods. Fetal gender assessment was performed in 1222 singleton pregnancies. In all fetuses the crown–rump length (CRL) was measured and the genital area of the fetus was examined in the mid–sagittal plane. The result of ultrasound examination was compared to the phenotypic sex of the newborn after delivery. Results. The feasibility as well as accuracy <b>in</b> determining <b>gender</b> increased with growing fetal CRL. At CRL < 50 mm (gestational age < 11 + 4) the feasibility was 39. 1 % and accuracy 30. 5 % (40. 9 % <b>in</b> male <b>gender</b> vs 24. 3 % <b>in</b> female <b>gender).</b> At CRL 50 – 54. 9 mm (gestational age 11 + 4 to 12 + 0) the feasibility was 63. 5 % and accuracy 75. 0 % (89. 1 % <b>in</b> male <b>gender</b> vs 66. 7 % <b>in</b> female <b>gender).</b> At CRL 55 – 59. 9 mm (gestational age 12 + 0 to 12 + 2) the feasibility was 90. 5 % and accuracy 96. 6 % (99. 1 % <b>in</b> male <b>gender</b> vs 93. 5 % <b>in</b> female <b>gender).</b> At CRL ≥ 60 mm (gestational age ≥ 12 + 2) the feasibility was 97. 4 % and accuracy 100. 0 % (100. 0 % <b>in</b> male <b>gender</b> vs 100. 0 % <b>in</b> female <b>gender).</b> Conclusions. Fetal gender may reliably be determined when CRL ≥ 60 mm (gestational age ≥ 12 + 2). Male gender may already be reliably determined when CRL ≥ 55 mm (gestational age ≥ 12 + 0). If CRL < 50 mm (gestational age < 11 + 4) the gender cannot be reliably predicted...|$|R
