5|$|<b>Investigators</b> <b>said</b> {{the murders}} were a targeted, execution-style attack and not {{associated}} with a robbery; Clemmons did not aim at any other customers or the two baristas working at the time. The four slain officers were Mark Renninger, 39 (killed with a shot to the head); Ronald Owens, 37 (shot in the neck); Tina Griswold, 40 (shot in the head); and Greg Richards, 42 (shot in the head).|$|E
5|$|On 23 March 2012, the U.S. {{government}} charged Bales with 17 {{counts of}} murder, six counts of attempted murder, and six counts of assault. On 24 March 2012, American <b>investigators</b> <b>said</b> they believe Bales split the killings {{in the villages}} of Balandi and Alkozai into two attacks, returning to Camp Belamby after the first attack before slipping out again an hour later. No other U.S. military personnel were disciplined for having any role in the incident.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{new details}} emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), {{two men who}} were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the {{reporter}} knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house {{on the night of}} her murder. After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. <b>Investigators</b> <b>said</b> that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a toilet bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to outweigh her because she only weighed 108lbs (48.9kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a camera and a small box, and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Scott Barfield, a Defense Department <b>investigator,</b> <b>said</b> {{there is}} an online network of gangs and extremists: [...] "They're {{communicating}} with each other about weapons, about recruiting, about keeping their identities secret, about organizing within the military." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} month, {{an internal}} NUS inquiry concluded that Bouattia {{had made an}} antisemitic statement, although four other such claims were rejected. As she had expressed regret, the <b>investigator</b> <b>said</b> that Bouattia should not face any action so long as she apologised.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there was}} {{evidence}} of many people being engaged in illegal activity, relatively few were questioned.

25|$|On {{the night}} of March 11, 2012, 16 Afghan civilians (nine children—some as young as two years old—four women and three men) were shot and killed in the villages of Balandi and Alkozai near Camp Belambai. On March 24, U.S. Army <b>investigators</b> <b>said</b> Bales {{was the only person}} {{responsible}} for the shootings and the deaths were the result of two separate attacks. <b>Investigators</b> <b>said</b> Bales returned to Camp Belambai after the first attack and left the camp an hour later to commit the second attack.|$|E

5000|$|Both parcels in the 2010 {{cargo plane}} bomb plot were x-rayed without the bombs being spotted. Qatar Airways said the PETN bomb [...] "could not be {{detected}} by x-ray screening or trained sniffer dogs". The Bundeskriminalamt received {{copies of the}} Dubai x-rays, and an <b>investigator</b> <b>said</b> German staff would not have identified the bomb either. New airport security procedures followed in the U.S., largely to protect against PETN.|$|R
25|$|Nine of the 19 {{people on}} board the {{aircraft}} died. Both the pilot and co-pilot {{were killed in the}} crash. Autopsies determined the cause of death to be smoke inhalation and burns. Federal <b>investigators</b> <b>said</b> the nine victims may not have died if their seat cushions had been treated with fire retardant. Ten people on the ground were also injured in the accident.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} involved was a Boeing 737-73V, registration HK-4682, with {{serial number}} (MSN) 32416, construction number 1270. The aircraft had its maiden flight on 10 January 2003, {{before it was}} delivered to another airline. It was subsequently delivered to AIRES on 6 March 2010. <b>Investigators</b> <b>said</b> {{the day after the}} crash that the aircraft's maintenance log was up to date. The accident was the first that resulted in a Boeing 737-700 being written off.|$|E
25|$|On the {{day after}} the crash, <b>investigators</b> <b>said</b> they had {{reviewed}} the flight recorders, and confirmed that there were no technical problems with the Soviet-built aeroplane, ruling out initial theories that the 20-year-old aircraft was at fault. Alexei Gusev, general director of the Aviakor factory, said that the aircraft's three engines had been repaired and technicians had upgraded the plane's avionics at a recent overhaul the previous year. He said that there were no doubts about the plane's airworthiness.|$|E

The method the crew used to navigate the aircraft is a particular avenue of the investigation into the accident.|$|R
25|$|The European Parliament {{launched}} its own {{investigation into the}} reports. In April 2006, MEPs leading the investigations expressed concerns that the CIA had conducted more than 1,000 secret flights over European territory since 2001, some to transfer terror suspects to countries that used torture. <b>Investigators</b> <b>said</b> that the same US agents and planes were involved over and over again. The Parliament adopted a resolution in July 2006 endorsing the Council of Europe's conclusions, midway through its own investigation into the alleged program.|$|E
25|$|Mark Fuhrman was {{not called}} to testify, and Simpson was subpoenaed to testify {{on his own}} behalf. In addition, a photo of Simpson, taken while he was {{attending}} a Buffalo Bills game in 1993, was presented at trial that showed him wearing Bruno Magli shoes, {{the same type of}} shoes which <b>investigators</b> <b>said</b> the killer of Goldman and Brown was wearing when the murders were committed. The photo was presented as evidence against him, as Simpson had previously denied ever wearing such shoes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Investigators</b> <b>said</b> Gelhaus {{feared for}} his safety after Lopez {{turned around and}} {{allegedly}} raised the pellet gun in his direction (a replica of an AK-47 that was an air-soft gun that fired plastic pellets). Gelhaus told investigators {{that he could not}} remember if he verbally identified himself as a deputy sheriff, although he was in a deputy sheriff's uniform and marked sheriff's patrol car before firing at Lopez; however, Lopez would not have seen the uniform or patrol car since the officers approached him from behind.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{accident}} {{occurred at}} the same station in December 1985, injuring 54 people. The 1985 crash {{was said to have}} been caused by a lubricant that had been applied to the tracks to test train wheels. In May 2011, a PATH train crashed in the basement of Hoboken Terminal, causing minor injuries. <b>Investigators</b> <b>said</b> that they will look into the possibility that the 2011 and 2016 accidents may have similar causes and circumstances. The December 2013 Spuyten Duyvil derailment was attributed to sleep apnea, which is a suspected factor in the 2016 Hoboken crash.|$|E
25|$|The EMS {{division}} was rocked by leadership scandals in 2004 and 2005. In August 2004, D.C. {{emergency medical services}} officials breached confidential patient records by taking them home, a blatant violation of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. EMS Medical Director Dr. Fernando Daniels III was terminated, and city <b>investigators</b> <b>said</b> that many {{or most of the}} EMS division's 35 managers could be fired. Daniels' successor, Dr. Clifford H. Turen, resigned on March 1, 2005, after it was learned that he had not yet received a license to practice medicine in the District of Columbia and his speciality was not in emergency medicine.|$|E
25|$|On 11 November 2013, {{four men}} {{received}} jail terms for the offences including commissioning {{an act of}} terror, murder and attempted murder.

The government's <b>investigators</b> <b>said</b> that the bombing was carried out by Magomed Yevloyev, Akhmed's brother, on the orders of the leader of the Caucasus Emirate, Doku Umarov. The convicted were accused of sheltering the bomber in Nazran, Ingushetia, providing him with money and putting him on a bus to Moscow in preparation for the attack. The investigators also said that his attack was plotted at a camp run by the Caucasus Emirate in Ingushetia.|$|E

25|$|Mixon had an {{extensive}} criminal history. Beginning at age 13, {{he was arrested}} multiple times for battery, and by age 20 was serving a Corcoran state prison sentence following a felony conviction for {{assault with a deadly}} weapon and armed robbery in San Francisco. After he was paroled, Mixon went in and out of prison. When the shootings happened, he was living in East Oakland at his grandmother's house and was wanted on a no-bail arrest warrant for violating his current parole conditions. On March 20, 2009, the day before the shootings, the Oakland Police Department learned that Mixon was linked by DNA to the February 5, 2009, rape of a twelve-year-old girl who was dragged off the street at gunpoint in the East Oakland neighborhood where Mixon's sister lived. On May 4, 2009, a state laboratory confirmed not just this link, but also confirmed that Mixon robbed and raped two young women about seven hours before the shootings (see above). <b>Investigators</b> <b>said</b> that Mixon may have committed several other rapes during recent months, although no convictions or indictments had been secured before his death. Had Mixon been arrested for his parole violation, he would have faced at most six months in prison; if convicted of rape, he faced a life sentence.|$|E
