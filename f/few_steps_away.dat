5|$|The Royal Hotel in {{the area}} of Woodhill was {{designed}} and built to serve Brunel's railway line which finished a <b>few</b> <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> from the Hotel. The original building survives as The Royal Inn pub. It was built in 1830 by the Corporation of Bristol (now known as Bristol City Council) in order to provide a hotel supporting the development of the seaside resort. It is thought to be the only seaside hotel to be built by a public authority during the nineteenth century. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

50|$|With all {{primaries}} held, Senator Goldwater {{was just}} a <b>few</b> small <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> from the presidential nomination. He had won 38% {{of the vote in}} the primaries, but his organization's successful work in non-primary states meant that he had 49% of the delegates. Gov. Rockefeller won 22% of the primary vote, 75% of which came from California. The favorite son candidates and unofficial candidates won 40% of the vote - more than either of the two leading candidates and a sign that the Republican faithful was remarkably dissatisfied with their choices.|$|R
50|$|When Walker Memorial opened {{later in}} 1948, it {{attracted}} a small clientele, who paid $9 {{a day for}} a room, meals and a daily hydrotherapy treatment. The hospital after a <b>few</b> years <b>stepped</b> <b>away</b> from its resort-style beginning and began expanding its services. Various changes were made to the main building and to outlying buildings and grounds. It was said that by 1973 renovations were so extensive, that it was difficult to recognize features of the original hotel. Also, a number of physician offices and various health clinics sprouted in the area south of the hospital. A child care center for hospital employees was constructed three blocks south of Walker Memorial.|$|R
25|$|An {{unveiling}} {{ceremony was}} held on Tuesday, July 1, 1890. Three of the association's executive committee members Edward Hawkins, Noble C. Butler, and John A. Holman, served as the Committee of Arrangements; a General Reception Committee was named and consisted of approximately one hundred Indianapolis citizens and two or more from each Indiana county. Indianapolis streets and buildings were decorated with lavish display of flags and bunting. A large, canvas-covered amphitheater with a stage, five hundred chairs and a raised pavilion for a large chorus of school children and other spectators was erected across Tennessee Street. The structure was elaborately decorated with bunting; the monument, which stood a <b>few</b> <b>steps</b> <b>away,</b> was covered in flags. Benches {{in front of the}} amphitheater supplied ticket-holder seating. Special invitations were sent to President Benjamin Harrison and ex-President Grover Cleveland and their cabinets, senators and congressmen, federal judges, and governors of other states. Governors from New York, Ohio, Missouri, and Indiana attended the event. The ceremonies began with a parade, followed by a program of activities: a call to order by Alvin P. Hovey, governor of Indiana; an invocation by Rev. Joseph S. Jenckes, of St. Paul’s Church, Indianapolis; music; a historical statement by Frederick Rand, president of the monument association; unveiling of the monument by Eliza C. Hendricks; a nine-round salute from Indianapolis Light Artillery; a dedicatory poem by James Whitcomb Riley of Indiana, read by Rev. Dr. D. W. Fisher, president of Hanover College; and address by David Turpie, U. S. Senator from Indiana; and a benediction from Reverend Francis Silas Chatard, Bishop of Vincennes.|$|E
500|$|Now {{considered}} part of the Mao family, Luo lived with Mao Yichang and Wen Qimei at their home, but was publicly humiliated by her husband's disappearance; some locals considered her to be Yichang's concubine. Luo Yixiu died of dysentery on 11 February 1910, the day after Chinese New Year. Mao Zedong returned home; his father forgave him for his disobedience, and in the autumn of 1910 agreed to finance his son's studies at the Dongshan Higher Primary School, and so Mao left Shaoshanchong. When in 1936 Mao told Snow [...] "I do not consider her my wife", he made no mention of her death. Luo Yixiu's grave is located on the mountain facing Mao Zedong's former residence in Shaoshanchong, a <b>few</b> <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> from the tomb of his parents.|$|E
