5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made his pledge to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} bored by all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies into her hand, and she decides {{to give it a}} try. When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone and so is the demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E
5|$|As the Griffin family {{attend the}} county fair, Stewie announces {{that he has}} bred a winning {{pedigree}} pig for the local Quahog Clam Day. Revealing to Brian that he got the pig from a parallel universe, he shows him a remote control that allows access to the various parallel universes. Each universe depicts Quahog {{in the same time}} and place but under different conditions. Deciding to test the device, they both visit a universe where Christianity never existed (despite the existence of the Sistine Chapel in that universe), leading an impressed Brian to ask whether the remote can take them to other alternative realities. Stewie guides them both through several more parallel universes, about half of which have their own portrayals of the Griffin family. As time passes, Brian begins to lose his amazement for the device and eventually comes to realize that Stewie <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> to return home.|$|E

500|$|After {{learning}} of Oswald's release, the agents {{rush to the}} hospital to protect the Kiveats, but the power goes out when they arrive and Zero's corpse appears in the elevator when its door slides open. Oswald confronts Scully and Sharon, and the latter fearfully agrees to leave with him in return for her husband's safety. The sheriff arrives and tries to stop him. While pursuing a fleeing Sharon, Oswald summons lightning but ends up striking himself once again and, in the process, kills the sheriff. Oswald is put in a psychiatric hospital, although the local district attorney <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> {{they will be able to}} prosecute him. As the agents observe Oswald, he uses his powers to change the channels of the TV in his room.

500|$|In 2009, {{the serial}} {{embarked}} on two lesbian storylines, {{one of which}} involved Nicole. It featured Freya Duric (Sophie Hensser) kissing Nicole, which sparked complaints. However, for Nicole it wasn't about sexuality, rather finding herself the center of attention. James described their dynamic, stating: [...] "Freya's exactly what Nicole was like when she first arrived in the bay, {{that is why they}} click. Nicole relates to the wild side of Freya, but <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> far Freya is going to take it." [...] Through her relationship with Geoff she had mellowed, however her vanity was still present. James said Nicole was [...] "angry" [...] because she was on Freya's [...] "not hot list". Freya kissed her to prove she thinks she is hot, James opined that Nicole did not enjoy the kiss, but was just [...] "happy to be center of attention" [...] and happy that people were talking about her again. The incident eventually brought her to the realisation that she had become boring. Nicole denied it was to do with her involvement with Geoff, however James said Geoff was the reason she became bored.|$|E

Hans convinces her to spare them to prove that she is not a monster. However, she is knocked unconscious and taken to her castle's dungeon. Hans visits her and urges her to end the winter; Elsa admits that she <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> to do so. After he leaves, she is able to break free from the chains by freezing them and escapes the cell, though her fears trigger a massive blizzard. Anna returns to the castle, believing that a romantic kiss from Hans will be the [...] "act of true love" [...] to save her. Instead, he informs her that his offer of marriage (engagement) had been the first step of a plot to get him the throne of Arendelle. Olaf tells Anna that Kristoff is in love with her and she believes that his kiss will cure her. They rush to find Kristoff. Hans confronts Elsa and tells her that she has killed Anna. Devastated, Elsa collapses and the blizzard stops suddenly. Hans approaches her and swings his sword to kill her, but Anna turns away from an approaching Kristoff with her last bit of strength and blocks Hans' attack as she freezes solid.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the success}} of the Apple I, Wozniak {{designed}} the Apple II, the first personal computer that had the ability to display color graphics, and BASIC programming language built-in. Inspired by [...] "the technique Atari used to simulate colors on its first arcade games", Wozniak found a way of putting colors into the NTSC system by using a $1 chip, while colors in the PAL system were achieved by [...] "accident" [...] when a dot occurred on a line, and to this day he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> it works. During the design stage, Steve Jobs argued that the Apple II should have two expansion slots, while Wozniak wanted six. After a heated argument, during which Wozniak had threatened for Jobs to 'go get himself another computer', they decided to go with eight slots. The Apple II {{became one of the first}} highly successful mass-produced personal computers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{book also}} {{reflects}} a significant shift in Adams's view of computers. In the previous books, computers had been portrayed quite negatively, reflecting Adams' {{views on the}} subject at the time. However, between the writing of Life, the Universe and Everything and So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, his attitude toward technology changed considerably. Having been taken along to a computer fair, he became enamored of the first model of the Macintosh, {{the start of a}} long love affair with the brand (he claimed to have bought two of the first three Macs in the UK— the other was bought by his friend Stephen Fry). In So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, Arthur Dent purchases an Apple computer for the purpose of star mapping in order to pinpoint the location of the cave he lived in on prehistoric Earth, and although Adams briefly mocks Arthur's methodology (noting that Arthur really <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> to go about such a task), the computer itself is not disparaged, and even somehow produces the correct result. In a later essay, Adams noted that some people had accused him of being a [...] "turncoat" [...] because of this change in his attitudes.|$|E
2500|$|Luis Paez-Pumar of Rolling Stone {{described}} WrestleMania as [...] "two-faced as a Gemini"—the {{first half}} [...] "was a brisk hybrid of styles and matches {{that made you}} think that WWE {{knew what it was}} doing all along with this lackluster build", but once Triple H appeared, the rest of the event [...] "was a slog of plodding wrestling, brief matches and boos". Paez-Pumar described that The Undertaker as [...] "should have retired when the Streak was broken", but [...] "lived on to pass the rub on to Reigns in the sloppiest, saddest manner possible". Paez-Pumar proclaimed that [...] "WWE <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> to handle Bray Wyatt", writing that Orton [...] "definitely did not need the title" [...] and ridiculing Wyatt's conjuring of [...] "projected video screen grossness" [...] as [...] "the dumbest crap". Paez-Pumar called for [...] "fresh blood or new ideas" [...] in both women's divisions and for Triple H to retire given that he [...] "has not put on a good Mania match" [...] since 2005 or 2006 once WrestleMania XXX was discounted. For the positives, Goldberg–Lesnar was a [...] "revitalizing adrenaline shot to the spine", Cena's proposal was [...] "magic in a way that no other entertainment can match", The New Day [...] "were excellent hosts; funny when called upon and out of the way when not", while [...] "a stale-ass tag team division just became the most must-see part of Raw" [...] due to the return of the Hardys.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2009, Chad was scripted {{as the son}} of Bill and Marsha Peterson. In June 2009 it was {{announced}} that David Leisure had been cast in the recurring role of D.A. Woods. In October 2009, the character's name was revised to Chad Peterson Woods when D.A. Woods was revealed to be his father. In February 2010 Soap Opera Digest reported that veteran soap actress, Jessica Tuck, known for her role as One Life to Live's Megan Gordon was cast in the role of Chad's mother. Deidrick explained that Chad goes to Kate for answers because she has been a [...] "mother figure." [...] Both the actor and executive producer Gary Tomlin enjoyed Chad's scenes with Koslow's Kate. Chad immediately confronts Madeline and he is [...] "completely devastated" [...] when she admits to being a former prostitute. Chad is fed up with his mother's lies and just wants everything out on the table. The revelation really impacts him in an [...] "inexplicable" [...] way. Deidrick described Chad's reaction as [...] "flabbergasted" [...] and wants to get away from her. When Chad witnesses Madeline's fall, he freezes for a moment because he is unable to [...] "process" [...] the situation. Such tragedy could have the potential to screw him up. Because Deidrick did not know the pain of losing a parent, let alone his own mother, the actor does his best to portray Chad during the scenes; Deidrick's first reaction as Chad is going into denial. Chad clings on to the little bit of courage he has left hoping to work things out with Charles in the future. According to Deidrick, the aftermath of his mother's death and his confrontation with Charles makes Chad a little [...] "cuckoo crazy." [...] Knowing Chad is all alone in the world Kate schemes to expose that Chad is Madeline's son with Kate's husband, Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) born on March 3, 1990, making him a whole year older than was initially said to be. The storyline showcased two very distinct sides to Chad's personality. According to Deidrick, during scenes with Kate, he intentionally emphasized Chad's vulnerabilities due to his mother's recent death; he is in desperate need of a mother figure at the moment, and Kate fills that void. Chad does not show that side of his personality too often for fear of getting hurt. On the other hand, Chad's relationship with his new found father Stefano appears to be a bit more volatile. The nature of the relationship is first displayed in November 2010 when Chad confronts Stefano with a knife and demands blood for a DNA test. Chad <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> to react to the DNA results. According to Deidrick, [...] " [...] struggles to find the courage to be able to love [...] who had a relationship with his mother and never knew he existed." [...] Deidrick explained that Chad rejects Stefano based on instinct. It is all he knows thanks to D.A. Woods who always pushes him away when things get difficult. However, Stefano is not easily turned away. Deidrick expected the role to be short lived thinking the character was only to wrap up the baby switch storyline. However, he accredited Gary Tomlin with fighting for the character and believing in him as an actor. Deidrick said that it was Tomlin's idea to attach him to a main family, [...] "So they made [...] a DiMera." ...|$|E

I turned the thing over in my mind, after you had left us; and the one course to take that I could see was to accept the position patiently, and to make the best instead of the worst of it. Having reached this conclusion, I settled the matter (as I settle most other difficulties)--by cutting the Gordian knot.
