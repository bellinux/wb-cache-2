While certain design features were adapted to more traditional hull designs (most of the self-powered whalebacks were [...] "stern enders"), the whalebacks cannot {{be said to be}} the prototypes of all to follow. They were a unique variation on a principle of design that started with R.J. Hackett in 1869 and advanced with Onoko (the second iron-hulled Great Lakes bulk carrier) in 1882. These principles included the consolidation of above-deck cabins at the extreme forward and aft limits of the hull to leave a large open area above the hold for both loading and unloading equipment, as well as a nearly box-like cross section to the hull to enable <b>heavy</b> <b>cargoes</b> in shallow water.|$|E
50|$|As intended, the Hermes was a {{reusable}} launch {{system that}} would have been used to transport both astronauts and moderate-size cargo payloads into low Earth orbit (LEO) and back again. In basic concept and operation, the Hermes bears a resemblance to other reusable space vehicles, such as the American Space Shuttle. However, unlike the Space Shuttle, Hermes had no ambition to carry <b>heavy</b> <b>cargoes</b> as this role was to be performed by the unmanned and automated Ariane 5 launcher instead. In the configuration envisioned prior to the project's termination, Hermes was to have been capable of transporting a maximum of three astronauts along with a 3,000 kg pressurized payload. The final launch weight would be 21,000 kg, which was viewed as being the practical upper limit of what an extended Ariane 5 launcher would be capable of lifting.|$|E

[...] The XCH-62 prototype was in an advanced state of assembly in 1975, being readied for a planned initial flight in 1976. Failures in the spiral bevel gearing of the main transmission were experienced in tests because the method of analysis employed had not considered the effect of rim bending. Consequently, new gears with strengthened rims were designed and fabricated. For a more accurate prediction of the load capacity of the gears, an extensive Finite Element Method (FEM) system was developed. The U.S. Army's XCH-62 HLH aft rotor transmission was finally successfully tested at full design torque and speed, but the US Congress cut funding for the program in August 1975. The designers of the Mil Mi-26 avoided similar problems by using a split-torque design in the main rotor transmission.|$|E

50|$|The ferry between Passage and Carrigaloe greatly {{promoted}} {{the trade of}} the town. Until {{the opening of the}} Cork to Cobh Railway the traffic on this ferry was considerable. Between 200 and 300 covered-in cars (jingles) brought passengers from Cork to Passage ferry daily. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, Cobh was the principal seaside resort in Munster, which richly benefited the Ferry. During the first twenty days of August 1836, over 20,000 people crossed on the ferry. This gave considerable employment. The boats were apparently large flat-bottomed ones worked by a system of cables and pulleys, and capable of taking very <b>heavy</b> <b>cargoes.</b> This ferry dated back to the reign of James I or even earlier. In his reign it was leased to a Patrick Terry for a yearly rent of 35 shillings. The fare was one penny for a person, a cow, a horse, or six sheep, swine or goats. The opening of a railway line to Cobh (then known as Queenstown) caused the demise of the Passage ferry; however in the early 1990s a car ferry service was opened between nearby Glenbrook and Carrigaloe on the Great Island. In the 19th century, Passage West became a popular bathing resort for the citizens of Cork, and the houses at Glenbrook and Toureen were in great demand during the summer. Fr. T.R. England, P.P. records in the Parish Register that Passage and more particularly Monkstown had many visitors during the summer season. According to a census taken by him in 1831 the population of Passage was 1,457, of whom 1,136 were Catholics. There were two hydropathic establishments in Glenbrook. The Victoria Baths was opened about 1808 and was very prosperous for a while. It closed owing to lack of support soon after the extension of the railway to Monkstown. Judging by its ruins it was a pretentious building. The other baths were situated almost directly opposite the Victoria Baths and were run in conjunction with St. Ann's Hydro, a large hydropathic facility near Blarney. In front of the Glen was a large pier, which was very much frequented until the railway was extended to Monkstown. It was then practically abandoned and became so unsafe that it was removed.|$|E

The risk of foundering increased with the age of the ship, and was related to the ship's flag of registration.

40|$|Pneumatic capsule {{pipeline}} (PCP) uses {{air blown}} through a pipeline to propel capsules (wheeled vehicles carrying cargoes) through the pipeline. It {{is a modern}} and large version of the century-old technology of “tube transport ” used rather widely and successfully {{in the first half}} of the 20 th century in major European and U. S. cities for transporting mail, parcels, telegraphs, documents, cash, and other lightweight materials. Modern PCP systems, such as those used in Japan for transporting limestone to a cement plant, use large wheeled capsules moving <b>heavy</b> <b>cargoes</b> through pipes of 3 -ft diameter, approximately. Each capsule can carry almost two tons of cargo. The system is driven by blowers located near the beginning of the pipeline, and it is highly automated (by computers and programmable logic controllers). The system is being used very successfully in Japan, with a high reliability record. Yet, only limited use exists today due to its high unit freight transportation cost in $/ton as compared to that by truck. The unit cost is high due to low system throughput (freight capacity). Major improvement in throughput can be made by replacing the pumping mechanism from blowers (which are used currently), to electromagnetic pumps (for the future systems), and using off-line loading/unloading. Research in such improvements of PCP is currently underway at the Capsule Pipeline Research Center at the University of Missouri-Columbia.
