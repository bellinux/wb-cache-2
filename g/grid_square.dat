5|$|The first {{strand of}} the novel follows Hollis Henry, {{a former member of}} the early 1990s cult band The Curfew and a {{freelance}} journalist. She is hired by advertising mogul Hubertus Bigend to write a story for his nascent magazine Node (described as a European Wired) about the use of locative technology in the art world. Helped by curator Odile Richard she investigates Los Angeles artist Alberto Corrales, who recreates virtually the deaths of celebrities such as River Phoenix. Corrales leads her to Bobby Chombo, an expert in geospatial technologies who handles Corrales' technical requirements. Chombo's background is troubleshooting navigation systems for the United States military. He is reclusive and paranoid, refusing to sleep in the same GPS <b>grid</b> <b>square</b> on consecutive nights, and only consents to talk to Hollis due to his admiration for The Curfew.|$|E

2500|$|Above {{the grid}} is a {{distance}} bar scale, notched with sub-units. There are {{two sets of}} numbers on the scale, one for measuring each <b>grid</b> <b>square</b> by 20 miles, another for measuring each <b>grid</b> <b>square</b> by 100 miles (see diagram). [...] The top bar is the 20m-per-square scale, with every black dot denoting one mile. [...] The bottom bar is the 100m-per-square scale, where {{the length of a}} unit square is divided into two equal 50m sub-squares, and a set of dots and red lines break it down further into lengths of 10 miles. [...] So depending on which scale one chooses, the length of the side of the entire grid (eight squares) could be measured up to 160 miles (using the 20m-per-square scale) or up to 800 miles (using the 100m-per-square scale).|$|E

The map shows 500 settlements and a dozen rivers in China, and extends as far as Korea and India.

2500|$|At a Crossbow {{meeting on}} 15 January 1945 Pile's updated plan was {{presented}} with some strong advocacy from Roderic Hill and Charles Drummond Ellis. However, the Committee suggested that a test not be carried out as no technique for tracking the missiles with sufficient accuracy had yet been developed. By March this had changed significantly, with 81% of incoming missiles correctly allotted to the <b>grid</b> <b>square</b> each fell into, or the one beside it. At a 26 March meeting the plan moved ahead, and Pile was directed to a subcommittee with RV Jones and Ellis to further develop the statistics. Three days later the team returned a report stating that if the guns fired 2,000 rounds at a missile there was a 1 in 60 chance of shooting it down. Plans for an operational test began, but as Pile later put it, [...] "Monty beat us to it", as the attacks ended with the Allied liberation of their launching areas.|$|E

Using generalized linear modeling, flo-ristic records and environmental variables derived from Landsat TM images and a digital elevation model, we built models for {{the total number of}} plant species and the number of rarities. We validated the accuracy of the derived models with a test set of 52 <b>grid</b> <b>squares</b> in the core study area. The final models explained ca. 46 - 51 % of the variation in the species data.

The results sug-gest that the local hotspots of total flora (<b>grid</b> <b>squares</b> with> 200 species) are mainly found in river valleys, where semi-open agricultural-forest mosaic occurs. The hotspots of rare species (<b>grid</b> <b>squares</b> with> 4 rare species) are mainly found in heterogeneous river valleys, where extensive semi-natural grasslands and herb-rich deciduous forests occur on steep slopes. 1...|$|R
