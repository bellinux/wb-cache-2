5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s she was {{attending}} art {{classes at the}} Art Students League of New York, and in 1941 she had her first solo exhibition. A student of Hans Hofmann and Chaim Gross, Nevelson experimented with early conceptual art using <b>found</b> <b>objects,</b> and dabbled in painting and printing before dedicating her lifework to sculpture. Usually created out of wood, her sculptures appear puzzle-like, with multiple intricately cut pieces placed into wall sculptures or independently standing pieces, often 3-D. A unique feature of her work is that her figures are often painted in monochromatic black or white. A figure in the international art scene, Nevelson was showcased at the 31st Venice Biennale. Her work is seen in major collections in museums and corporations. Nevelson {{remains one of the}} most important figures in 20th-century American sculpture.|$|E

25|$|The late 1950s {{and early}} 1960s in France saw art forms {{that might be}} {{considered}} Pop Art. Yves Klein had attractive nude women roll around in blue paint and throw themselves at canvases. Victor Vasarely invented Op-Art by designing sophisticated optical patterns. Artists of the Fluxus movement such as Ben Vautier incorporated graffiti and <b>found</b> <b>objects</b> into their work. Niki de Saint-Phalle created bloated and vibrant plastic figures. Arman gathered together <b>found</b> <b>objects</b> in boxed or resin-coated assemblages, and César Baldaccini produced a series of large compressed object-sculptures. In May 1968, the radical youth movement, through their atelier populaire, produced {{a great deal of}} poster-art protesting the moribund policies of president Charles de Gaulle.|$|E

25|$|Still life, as a {{particular}} genre, began with Netherlandish {{painting of the}} 16th and 17th centuries. Early still-life paintings, particularly before 1700, often contained religious and allegorical symbolism relating to the objects depicted. Some modern still-life work breaks the two-dimensional barrier and employs three-dimensional mixed media, and uses <b>found</b> <b>objects,</b> photography, computer graphics, as well as video and sound.|$|E
25|$|A collage may {{sometimes}} include magazine and newspaper clippings, ribbons, paint, bits of colored or handmade papers, portions of other artwork or texts, photographs and other <b>found</b> <b>objects,</b> glued {{to a piece}} of paper or canvas. The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of years, but this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the early 20th century as an art form of novelty.|$|E

The live performances with Einheit in the 1980s included lots of metal banging and destruction on stage.|$|E

25|$|Cornell's most {{characteristic}} {{art works}} were boxed assemblages created from <b>found</b> <b>objects.</b> These are simple shadow boxes, usually fronted {{with a glass}} pane, in which he arranged eclectic fragments of photographs or Victorian , {{in a way that}} combines the formal austerity of Constructivism with the lively fantasy of Surrealism. Many of his boxes, such as the famous Medici Slot Machine boxes, are interactive and are meant to be handled.|$|E

The most well known example is My Bed, where she displayed her bed. Another instance is the removal of her beach hut from Whitstable to be displayed in a gallery. This work was titled The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here (The Hut) (1999).|$|E
25|$|By 1962, Rauschenberg's {{paintings}} {{were beginning to}} incorporate not only <b>found</b> <b>objects</b> but found images as well - photographs transferred to the canvas {{by means of the}} silkscreen process. Previously used only in commercial applications, silkscreen allowed Rauschenberg to address the multiple reproducibility of images, and the consequent flattening of experience that implies. In this respect, his work is contemporaneous with that of Andy Warhol, and both Rauschenberg and Johns are frequently cited as important forerunners of American Pop Art.|$|E

25|$|The Western {{tradition}} of sculpture began in ancient Greece, and Greece is {{widely seen as}} producing great masterpieces in the classical period. During the Middle Ages, Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith. The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo's David. Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and {{the emphasis on the}} depiction of the human body, with the making of constructed sculpture, and the presentation of <b>found</b> <b>objects</b> as finished art works.|$|E
25|$|The name Merzbow {{comes from}} the German dada artist Kurt Schwitters' artwork Merzbau, in which Schwitters {{transformed}} the interior of his house using <b>found</b> <b>objects.</b> The name was chosen to reflect Akita's dada influence and junk art aesthetic. In addition to this, Akita has cited {{a wide range of}} musical influences from progressive rock, heavy metal, free jazz, and early electronic music to non-musical influences like dadaism, surrealism, and fetish culture. Since the early 2000s, he has been inspired by animal rights and environmentalism, and began to follow a vegan, straight edge lifestyle.|$|E
