5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could <b>hear</b> <b>every</b> instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
25|$|As of the First Congress, the Supreme Court justices rode circuit to sit as {{panels to}} hear appeals from the {{district}} courts. In 1891, Congress enacted a new system. District courts would have original jurisdiction. Intermediate appellate courts (circuit courts) with exclusive jurisdiction heard regional appeals before consideration by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court holds discretionary jurisdiction, meaning {{that it does not}} have to <b>hear</b> <b>every</b> case that is brought to it.|$|E
25|$|Because {{there was}} no orchestra, {{there was no}} space {{separating}} the audience from the stage. The audience could stand {{directly in front of}} the elevated wooden platform. This gave them the opportunity to look at the actors from a much different perspective. They would have seen every detail of the actor and <b>hear</b> <b>every</b> word he said. The audience member would have wanted that actor to speak directly to them. It was a part of the thrill of the performance, as it is to this day.|$|E

[...] Shay Haley, {{a member of the}} band, went on saying, [...] "Me, personally, I'm shocked it's being embraced the way it is. I feel like it sticks out like a sore thumb in comparison to what you <b>hear</b> <b>every</b> day on the radio… It's just our personal observation of what we've seen {{over the past couple of}} years, so we felt like making a party record out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson did {{not attempt}} to create schools of {{theories}} to analyse the aesthetics of literature. Instead, he used his criticism for the practical purpose of helping others to better read and understand literature. When it came to Shakespeare's plays, Johnson emphasised the role of the reader in understanding language: [...] "If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers, it is to be imputed to the nature of his work, which required the use of common colloquial language, and consequently admitted many phrases allusive, elliptical, and proverbial, such as we speak and <b>hear</b> <b>every</b> hour without observing them".|$|E
500|$|Tennyson's poems {{traditionally}} {{rely on the}} use {{of visual}} imagery for effect. In [...] "Mariana", Tennyson instead emphasises auditory imagery that serves to emphasise her solitude. Her hearing is sensitive and she is able to <b>hear</b> <b>every</b> sound, which only reveals the silence of her surroundings. Her solitude and loneliness causes her to be unable to recognise the beauty of her surroundings, and the world to her is dreary. In contrast to Tennyson's other poems, including [...] "The Lady of Shalott", there is no movement within [...] "Mariana". There is also a lack of a true ending within the poem, unlike the later version Mariana in the South, which reworks the poem so there is a stronger conclusion that can be found within death.|$|E

500|$|Hubbard {{played a}} very {{active role in the}} Dianetics boom, writing, lecturing and {{training}} auditors. Many of those who knew him spoke of being impressed by his personal charisma. Jack Horner, who became a Dianetics auditor in 1950, later said, [...] "He was very impressive, dedicated and amusing. The man had tremendous charisma; you just wanted to <b>hear</b> <b>every</b> word he had to say and listen for any pearl of wisdom." [...] Isaac Asimov recalled in his autobiography how, at a dinner party, he, Robert Heinlein, L. Sprague de Camp and their wives [...] "all sat as quietly as pussycats and listened to Hubbard. He told tales with perfect aplomb and in complete paragraphs." [...] As Atack comments, he was [...] "a charismatic figure who compelled the devotion of those around him".

Beamount also said that the video's quality [...] "lacks a lot of the polish that more recent recordings have," [...] but he later said that he would rather see it in low quality rather than high quality. Chad Bowar of About.com also gave the DVD {{three and a half}} out of five stars.

Austin Murphy of Sports Illustrated noted that Reeves' return [...] " [...] the already close-knit Falcons," [...] and Falcons linebacker Jessie Tuggle agreed: [...] "Dan has really inspired us all. [...] He walked in the meeting room four days after having had surgery, and you could have heard a pin drop. We wanted to <b>hear</b> <b>every</b> last word he had to say." [...] Reeves described his time during the season as [...] "more rewarding than any other teams I've been involved in," [...] and to Falcons special teams coach Joe DeCamillis, Reeves' leadership that season was [...] "his best coaching job ever."

500|$|More {{negative}} reception {{came from}} the magazine Empire, where reviewer Ian Nathan compared the film to New Coke, saying that [...] "it utterly failed". Phil Villarreal believed that there were [...] "too few laugh-worthy moments" [...] and that [...] "instead of stretching to new frontiers, the film rests on the familiar". Sheila Johnston criticized the pacing of the film and its joke level saying that [...] "the overall momentum flags at times" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "a salvo of comic squibs, some very funny, others limp". David Edwards agreed with this, writing that although [...] "there's a great half-hour show rattling around...the rest is padding at its very dullest", concluding that it [...] "isn't a terrible film, just a terribly disappointing one." [...] Cosmo Landesman believed, [...] "the humour seem to have lost its satirical bite and wit" [...] and that [...] "much of the comedy is structured around the idiocy of Homer". This assessment was shared by Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times, who felt that [...] "once the movie wanders into its contemplation of mortality and meaning, the trenchancy kind of creaks and falls off." [...] She negatively compared it to [...] (1999), a film similarly adapted from an animated television series, saying that, in terms of satire, it offers [...] "nothing we don't <b>hear</b> <b>every</b> night on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart." [...] Bruce Newman criticized the fleeting appearances of many of the show's secondary characters, and found the film to be [...] "a disappointment".|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazines Joe Sweeney {{felt that}} [...] "Work" [...] was the album's {{standout}} track {{and believed that}} it portrayed {{a real sense of}} Azalea's potential as a storyteller, and commended her delivery, [...] "You can <b>hear</b> <b>every</b> inch of how far she's come". Sweeney's view was shared by Andy Gill from The Independent who also named [...] "Work" [...] the highlight on The New Classic, and said Azalea's double-time delivery was best-employed on the song. HipHopDX's Marcus Dowling wrote that [...] "Work" [...] was [...] "an extraordinarily well-rounded listen" [...] and the [...] "honest and intriguing greatness" [...] of The New Classic. Dowling commented that the line, [...] "No money, no family, 16 in the middle of Miami", provided an [...] "ocean of depth [...] that makes the rest of the album feel like swimming in a kiddie pool". Matt Jost of RapReviews.com concurred, and called the song [...] "the sure winner" [...] and [...] "lyrically most ambitious offering" [...] of the album. Jost opined that the track was [...] "memorable" [...] and its production [...] "cleverly subverts expectations", and explained, [...] "It's when she keeps it simple and relies on her indeed present swagger that the Iggy Azalea character works best". Similarly, Alex Scordelis of Paper described the track as [...] "the cornerstone" [...] of the album and complimented its [...] "insanely catchy chorus". Scordelis believed it marked a heightened evolution in Azalea's growth as a rapper, and stated, [...] " [...] a song you can easily imagine Azalea performing for years to come".|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Opera House was {{conceived}} in 1908 by Maurice Bandmann, a famous entertainer from Calcutta, and Jehangir Framji Karaka, who headed a coal brokers’ firm. A baroque design incorporating {{a blend of}} European and Indian detailing was chosen for the structure. A long frontage was created to let carriages drive up to the entrance. Twenty-six rows of boxes behind the stalls were put up for the best view of the stage. The ceiling was constructed to enable even those in the gallery to <b>hear</b> <b>every</b> word uttered by the performers.|$|E

2500|$|Anthrax {{intended}} to release Anthems {{as a tribute}} to the bands that influenced them over the years. Vocalist Joey Belladonna explained: [...] "These are all bands I grew up with and have listened to forever. It's just great music. I had fun singing these songs and I was happy recording together with Anthrax, doing classic rock songs." [...] When asked how the band got the idea to do such a record, bassist Frank Bello answered: [...] "The reason why that happened, if you ever came to an Anthrax sound check, you’d probably <b>hear</b> <b>every</b> other song but an Anthrax song." [...] He further said that the band got the idea while jamming to some older songs. [...] "We just wanted to say this is where we also came from. That gave us our start and that is what sparked us." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Opera House {{is built}} in a baroque design {{featuring}} a blend of European and Indian architectural styles. The design was conceived in 1908 by Maurice Bandmann, an entertainer from Kolkata and [...] his partner Jehangir Framji Karaka, who {{was the head of}} a firm of coal brokers. It was built with exquisite Italian marble on a leased land close to the Kennedy and Sandhurst bridges. Although the work was completed in 1912, several additions were made until 1915. The pediment figure at the pinnacle was substituted with three cherubs. A pair of unique crystal chandeliers, called the ‘Sans Souci’ were donated by the David Sassoon family. The chandeliers, which were earlier located in the Sassoon mansion, were shifted to the foyer of the opera house. At the main entrance, the dome is segmented into eight different parts [...] "as a tribute to poets, dramatists, novelists, literati and people from art and culture." [...] The original interior of the opera house consisted of orchestra stalls with cosy cane chairs. Behind the stalls were 26 rows of boxes with couches. The seating enabled {{a clear view of the}} stage to all the people seated in the stalls and in the Dress Circle. The acoustics were of the opera house were created by shaping the ceiling in a manner that permitted distinct audibility that allowed the audience seated in the gallery to <b>hear</b> <b>every</b> word or song from the stage. The entrance was originally designed with a frontage for carriages to drive in.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Freeze is {{featured}} in [...] Mr. Freeze's freeze gun {{can be found}} in the evidence room at the Gotham City Police Department. According to Aaron Cash, Mr. Freeze hasn't been seen or heard since Arkham City and implies that he possibly gave up his criminal life to continue his work on finding a cure for Nora Fries. There was also a mentioning that the freeze gun was used by some members of the Gotham City Police Department to make ice cream until it was confiscated from them by James Gordon. Mr. Freeze appears in the December [...] "Season of Infamy" [...] downloadable content (DLC) pack in the side misson [...] "In From The Cold". Batman discovers a frozen vessel just off the coast of Gotham and investigates finding Mr. Freeze at his wife's old cryogenic chamber. He says that the Arkham Knight's Militia took Nora after he refused to help Scarecrow and Arkham Knight with their plans to take down Batman. Freeze entrusts Batman to rescue his wife from the soldiers. After fighting through a barrage of Militia henchmen, Batman finds Nora and breaks her out of her damaged cryochamber. Much to both Batman and Freeze's surprise, she no longer wants to be frozen in ice and simply wants to spend time with Victor. It's also revealed that she could <b>hear</b> <b>every</b> word he said, despite being in suspended animation. After taking down a Militia force trying to destroy Fries' vessel, Nora and Victor meet face-to-face and Victor removes his protective helmet. As they look off at Gotham, Nora asks how long they will live, to which Victor replies [...] "merely days". They then depart Gotham City; when Batman analyses Freeze's equipment in the GCPD lockup, a recording made by Cash ponders whether this turn of events is a happy or sad outcome for the Fries'.|$|E
