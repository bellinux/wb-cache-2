5|$|Based on {{morphological}} features, the Alexandrine parakeet (Psittacula eupatria) {{has been}} proposed as the founder population for all Psittacula species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species' southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. <b>Features</b> <b>of</b> that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range. Subfossil remains of Newton's parakeet show that it differed from other Mascarene Psittacula species in some osteological features, but also had similarities, such as a reduced sternum, which suggests a close relationship. Skeletal features indicate an especially {{close relationship with the}} Alexandrine parakeet and the rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), but the many derived <b>features</b> <b>of</b> Newton's parakeet indicates it had long been isolated on Rodrigues.|$|E

40|$|Negative priming {{paradigms}} examine selective attention, and may {{be explained}} by inhibitory processes (e. g. Tipper, 1985). Our study examines inhibition in children (6 - 11 years), younger adults (18 - 22 years), and older adults (60 - 82 years). Younger adults show inhibition to the reported <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> a stimulus (location or identity) (Milliken, Tipper, 2 ̆ 6 Weaver, 1994) and to the defining <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> a stimulus (identity or colour) (Simone, Carlisle, 2 ̆ 6 McCormick, 1998). Neither children (Tipper, Bourque, Anderson, 2 ̆ 6 Brehaut, 1989) nor older adults (Connelly 2 ̆ 6 Hasher, 1993) have consistently shown significant inhibition to the reported <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> identity, suggesting developmentally impaired inhibitory processing.

5|$|Jellyvision Games did {{not want}} to change much of the older games for the 2011 version. They sought to keep as many of the old game {{question}} types, such as the Jack Attack and Dis Or Dat questions, updating the games to support online play. To counterbalance other types that would not be playable on consoles, such as Gibberish Questions that required players to type in a phrase, the developers added new features to the game, such as the Wrong Answer of the Game. The developers took advantage of other <b>features</b> <b>of</b> the newer consoles: they were able to use rumble <b>features</b> <b>of</b> console controllers to emphasize the effect of Screwing other players, and wrote several humorous titles for the in-game achievements.|$|E

It is easily understood that only the resonance frequency equals to the frequency of detected sine waves, the instantaneous power calculation under SOGI method can generate a correct result. The larger the frequency deviation is, the more phase-shift and amplitude decay occurs. Therefore, the program embedded feature and continuity <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> the intrinsic frequency can provide the advantage to calculate more accurate instantaneous power while maintain the dynamic stability of the original SOGI method. While in the conventional method, the constant resonance frequency would lead to an imprecise power result.|$|R
