The Code was also subject to widespread criticism from bench and bar that it was structurally flawed, difficult to understand, hard to obey, and impossible to enforce. The Code consisted of Canons, Ethical Considerations, and Disciplinary Rules, of which the first two were aspirational and only the third was mandatory. This forced judges and lawyers to sort through a maze of Canons and Ethical Considerations just to understand the <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>Rule</b> that controlled a particular ethical issue. During a key debate in late January 1982 over whether to replace the Model Code with the Model Rules, one delegate [...] "referred to the nine canons, 129 ethical considerations and forty-three disciplinary rules as a three-dimensional chess game that lawyers played at their own peril."

Although the vast majority of criminal cases in the United States are resolved by guilty plea rather than by trial, ABA Model Rule 3. 8, the special <b>disciplinary</b> <b>rule</b> applicable to prosecutors, has very little to say about plea bargaining. Scrutinizing the multiplicity of interests at stake in plea bargaining, the author suggests that a prosecutor’s primary objectives during negotiations should be efficiency, equality, autonomy, and transparency. After defining each of these terms, the author identifies several troublesome and recurring practices employed by prosecutors in the plea bargaining context that in his view violate a prosecutor’s duty to “do justice,” but yet presently are entirely unregulated. He then demonstrates how a focus on efficiency, equality, autonomy and transparency might help prosecutors avoid these ethical minefields...|$|E
40|$|Lawyers {{participating}} in legal malpractice litigation sometimes encounter evidence of serious <b>disciplinary</b> <b>rule</b> violations. Whether, and how soon, those lawyers {{are required to}} report this information to grievance authorities {{is a question that}} has received little attention from courts and scholars, despite the fact that most states have mandatory reporting rules. The dilemma for lawyers serving as testifying experts is particularly troublesome because nonreporting may result not only in discipline, but testimonial impeachment. The better view is that an expert in a pending case ordinarily has no mandatory obligation to report misconduct. This conclusion is supported by an analysis of the narrowness of the reporting obligation, the exceptions to the rule, public policy considerations related to malpractice litigation and grievance procedures, and customary professional practices. However, after litigation ends, an expert (and other lawyers) may have a duty to call evidence of serious misconduct to the attention of disciplinary authorities...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of the constitutional free expression guarantee to {{the activities of the}} organized bar {{is one of the most}} important unexplored areas of legal ethics. In this essay I will consider in particular the question of whether an applicant may be denied admission to the bar for involvement with hateful or discriminatory activities. This question reveals the tension between the first amendment principle, established after the agonizing struggles of the McCarthy era, that no one may be denied membership in the bar because of his or her beliefs alone, and the plenary authority of bar associations to make predictive judgments about the character and fitness of applicants and their ability to function as lawyers. It is also the most recent iteration of the running clash between two constitutional values—freedom of speech, as enshrined in the First Amendment, and racial equality, embodied in the Fourteenth. In this essay I will discuss the constitutional issues presented in bar admissions cases by focusing on the controversy surrounding the {{application of}} Matthew Hale, an avowed white supremacist, to the Illinois bar. The Illinois bar committee denied Hale’s application on the ground that he was unlikely to comply with a state <b>disciplinary</b> <b>rule</b> prohibiting racial discrimination. As this case shows, the application of hate speech regulations to the organized bar is complicated by the disciplinary structure under which lawyers operate, and by the ethical traditions of the practice of law. In the bar admissions and hate-speech cases, courts must grapple with a question of priority, namely, whether to elevate the constitutional value of racial equality over the expressive and associational liberties of lawyers and bar applicants...|$|E
40|$|In {{the spring}} of 2009, I sent Fred Zacharias an e-mail {{to let him know}} that the American Bar Association 2 ̆ 7 s (ABA) Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, on which I was serving, was working on an opinion on prosecutorial ethics and to suggest that once it was published, the opinion might be fodder for our next article. Over the {{preceding}} decade, Fred and I had coauthored five articles on the regulation of prosecutors, 2 ̆ 7 and various others on the regulation of lawyers in general, but at that time, we had no work in progress and had been out of touch for a while. It was time to pick up a summer project. The subject of the ABA committee 2 ̆ 7 s inquiry in what later became Opinion 09 - 454 was the model ethics rule on prosecutors 2 ̆ 7 disclosure obligations. The rule calls upon a prosecutor to 2 ̆ 2 make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused. The rule goes back four decades. The ABA first adopted it in 1969 as <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>Rule</b> (DR) 7 - 103 (B) of the Model Code of Professional Responsibility, and then carried it over into Rule 3. 8 (d) of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct (ABA Model Rules). s But this would be the committee 2 ̆ 7 s first opinion addressing this rule and it would help fill a void.

40|$|Thirty years ago, the Nebraska Supreme Court {{adopted the}} American Bar Association 2 ̆ 7 s 1969 Model Code of Professional Responsibility.

In 2002 the ABA revised the 1983 {{version of the}} Model Rules, and it now recommends states adopt these revisions to the Model Rules. The most important reason Nebraska should adopt the revised Model Rules is they provide a conceptual and linguistic vocabulary for ethics dialogue and education. However, if the same words are used in different ways, conversation will be confused and impeded rather than facilitated. Here, I discuss {{one example of a}} case in which the Nebraska Supreme Court adopted the Model Rules 2 ̆ 7 common vocabulary but interpreted its language in an uncommon way. The court ventured on its own to adopt a 2 ̆ 2 bright line 2 ̆ 2 rule to resolve conflicts that arise when a lawyer or student law clerk leaves one firm to work on her own or with another firm. The Nebraska Supreme Court did not follow the prudent course of adopting the relevant Model Rule in its entirety. It first articulated a 2 ̆ 2 bright line 2 ̆ 2 rule in a judicial opinion. It then reiterated the rule in <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>Rule</b> 5 - 108 (B), using the common vocabulary of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct. It then interpreted the common language in its own way. Why was the common language used? Why the different interpretation? What was the court trying to do? What policy was it trying to advance? Were its goals similar to the ABA 2 ̆ 7 s goals? None of this is clear...|$|E

40|$|Sixty-five years ago, an American Bar Association (ABA) {{committee}} {{interpreting the}} Canons of Professional Ethics (Canons) {{concluded that it}} would be professionally improper for a part-time prosecutor to agree to defend an individual in a civil action while simultaneously prosecuting him on felony charges. The committee acknowledged that the representation of conflicting interests is ordinarily proper with the respective clients 2 ̆ 7 consent. But it said that client consent does not suffice in a case involving a public officer, who has a duty 2 ̆ 2 to be and remain above all suspicion, even at personal financial sacrifice. 2 ̆ 2 It concluded that such 2 ̆ 2 [a]n attorney should not only avoid all impropriety but should likewise avoid the appearance of impropriety. 2 ̆ 2 The opinion was unremarkable but for the biblically resonant exhortation to 2 ̆ 2 avoid the appearance of impropriety. 2 ̆ 2 - The phrase, capturing the principle that lawyers in public life, like judges, should {{err on the side of}} caution, was invoked by courts only rarely over the next thirty-five years. Nonetheless, in 1969, when the ABA replaced the Canons with the Model Code of Professional Responsibility (Model Code or Code), 2 ̆ 2 the moral obligation to 2 ̆ 2 avoid the appearance of impropriety 2 ̆ 2 was incorporated in the title of a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>rule</b> whose provisions addressed the integrity of judicial and public decision making in a 2 ̆ 2 canon 2 ̆ 2 (an 2 ̆ 2 axiomatic norm 2 ̆ 2 from which disciplinary rules were derived); 1 o and in several 2 ̆ 2 ethical considerations 2 ̆ 2 (aspirational principles). 2 ̆ 2 Within a few years, every state, with the exception of California, adopted a version of the Model Code recognizing this obligation. To the ABA drafters, the injunction to avoid the appearance of impropriety was meant to serve as an aspirational principle to guide lawyers in the exercise of their independent judgment, and perhaps as a principle of interpretation, calling for restrictive readings of the disciplinary rules in areas of uncertainty. It was not intended to serve as a disciplinary standard or a disqualification rule. 2 ̆ 2 Courts, disciplinary bodies, and ethics committees soon discovered, however, that the Code 2 ̆ 7 s disciplinary rules did not adequately address the full spectrum of lawyers 2 ̆ 7 questionable conduct. Some seized upon the appearance of impropriety language as a catch-all to address the Code 2 ̆ 7 s perceived shortcomings. As a result, these institutions soon began to rely on the appearance of impropriety standard in evaluating the propriety of lawyers 2 ̆ 7 conduct. Further, they came to use it not only in opinions addressing government lawyers 2 ̆ 7 conflicts of interest, but also in addressing privately retained lawyers 2 ̆ 7 conflicts of interest. In response, a number of courts and commentators, together with the ABA 2 ̆ 7 s ethics committee, took the view that it was inappropriate to employ so vague a standard 2 ̆ 2 for anything other than lawyers 2 ̆ 7 individual guidance. 2 ̆ 2 Their conviction that more precise and objective measures were needed for disciplinary and disqualification purposes carried the day in 1983 when the ABA, in replacing the Model Code with the Model Rules of Professional Conduct (Model Rules),pointedly eliminated the appearance of impropriety standard. 2 ̆ 7 In the succeeding years, the overwhelming majority of states adopted provisions based on the ABA Model Rules and all but one, in doing so, followed the ABA 2 ̆ 7 s lead. New Jersey, the maverick, went in the opposite direction when it revised its ethical rules in 1984 in response to the new ABA model. Contrary to recommendations of the committee it had appointed to review the ABA 2 ̆ 7 s work product, the New Jersey Supreme Court adopted several provisions that specifically preserved the appearance of impropriety standard to address purported conflicts of interest. Hence, the question: Should the appearance of impropriety rule be eliminated in New Jersey-or revived everywhere else? In reply, this Article demonstrates that both the meaning and the utility of the appearance of impropriety rule depend on the con- text in which it is used. Focusing on how the rule has developed and been applied in New Jersey, the Article identifies the virtues of the rule in contexts involving alleged conflicts of interest on the part of lawyers for public entities and in related contexts where the public as a party has a direct stake. These are, not surprisingly, the contexts in which the rule originated. In contrast, the Article argues that the rule has nothing to commend it in contexts involving lawyers for private parties in which the public has no stake. By way of background, Part I of this Article traces the development of New Jersey 2 ̆ 7 s appearance of impropriety rule. Part II discusses how the doctrine is presently applied in cases involving the public interest and suggests that, in this realm, the rule performs a useful function, albeit one that would be better served by more specific rules. Finally, using a recent New Jersey ethics opinion as an illustration, Part III identifies the deficiencies of the rule in cases involving exclusively private interests...|$|E
