5000|$|The Rural Radio Network (RRN) was an <b>interconnected</b> <b>group</b> of six {{commercial}} FM {{radio stations}} spread across upstate New York and operated from Ithaca, NY -- the first all-radio, no-wireline {{network in the}} world. [...] It began operation in 1948 as an innovative broadcast service to the agricultural community, but competition from television—and a lack of affordable, well-performing FM receivers—caused the founders' original business plan to fail. The stations changed ownership, as well as Radio formats, several times in futile attempts to achieve profitability. Perhaps the group's most notable owner was the Christian Broadcasting Network, headed by televangelist Pat Robertson, which acquired the stations through a corporate donation in 1969. A decade later, Robertson decided to sell the stations and the licenses were gradually transferred to individual owners in 1981 and 1982, thus dissolving one of the nation's earliest FM networks.|$|E
3000|$|S. Kauffman proposed, that in {{a mixture}} of catalytically active {{polymers}} able to catalyze different types of reactions, a reaction network will appear in which all the species are interconnected by the number of reactions where they function as mutual catalysts. He called these <b>interconnected</b> <b>groups</b> [...] "autocatalytic sets" [...] [9]. When natural selection leading to Darwinian Evolution is applied to the mixture, the groups have a significant evolutionary advantage for the propagation of their genetic information, compared to single self-replicating molecules. The appearance of autocatalytic sets on the early Earth required a method for the formation of the mixtures of polymers able to perform catalysis.|$|R

5000|$|Bigo, also Bigo bya Mugenyi, is an {{extensive}} alignment of ditches and berms comprising ancient earthworks {{located in the}} interlacustrine region of southwestern Uganda. Situated on the southern shore of the Katonga River, Bigo is best described as having two elements. The first consists of a long, irregular ditch and bank alignment with multiple openings that effectively creates an outer boundary by connecting to the Kotanga River {{in the east and}} the Kakinga swamp to the west. Toward its eastern end the outer ditch branches further to the east to encompass a nearby crossing of the Katonga River. The second element consists of a central, <b>interconnected</b> <b>group</b> of four irregularly shaped ditch and bank enclosures that are connected to the Katonga River by a single ditch. Three mounds are associated with the central enclosures; two within and one immediately to the west. When combined, the Bigo earthworks extend for more than 10 kilometers. Resulting from radiometric dates collected from archaeological investigations conducted in 1960 and additional investigations undertaken at the Mansa earthworks site in 1988, 1994, and 1995, the Bigo earthworks have been dated to roughly AD 1300-1500, and have been called Uganda's [...] "largest and most important ancient monument." ...|$|E
