40|$|<b>Information</b> <b>push</b> and <b>information</b> pull have {{recently}} emerged as useful concepts {{to describe the}} operation of distributed <b>information</b> resources. <b>Information</b> <b>push,</b> in particular, is becoming closely associated with intelligent agent functionality. Loosely speaking, if a user requests and receives a very speci c piece of information, this is information pull. If information is sent {{in anticipation of the}} user's need, or the agent's response includes information not directly solicited, then the situation is characterized as <b>information</b> <b>push.</b> Intuitively, junk mail (electronic or paper), television newscasts and wirefeeds are examples of <b>information</b> <b>push.</b> New web services such asPointcast and Informant are examples of more selective push technologies. Web browsing, library searches, and telephone white pages are traditional examples of information pull. Clearly, these categorizations can be ambiguous and are easily lost in semantics. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} formalize these concepts and describe a mathematical framework around which further work can be more precise. Speci cally, we develop a stochastic framework based on Markov models to describe an ambientenvironment and an agent system. Depending on the relationships between the environment, the agent and the user's performance criterion, a continuum of possible <b>information</b> <b>push</b> and pull scenarios can be described. Some basic analytic results concerning the operation of a push/pull information system are derived. ...|$|R

The Swedish Radio used SMS in their reports from the event, approximately they pushed 500 messages to each subscriber during the weekend. The messages contained information about the rally and the local traffic situation. The subscribers of the services were a selected group of spectators, equipped with the phone Nokia 7110. We have examined the spectator's impression of the service provided. Problems experienced by spectators' were; information overload mostly due to change of context, lack of support in the phone and naming conventions regarding headers {{as well as in}} some cases interpreting the meaning of content. On the stage the value of the <b>information</b> <b>pushed,</b> was high but the time available for perceiving it was limited.

The SDI service model has an rss feeds management module and an <b>information</b> <b>push</b> module. In the first module, resources are represented as rss feed items and are also semi-automatically assigned subject terms by matching their associated keywords against the terms of a SKOS Core format thesaurus.

Amobile dialog system should provide robust task man-agement during network loss, and intelligent assistance in new environments. To provide these capabilities, a system must sense changes in the user environment, and communicate them effectively to the user. In the field of human-computer interaction, such systems {{are referred to as}} context-aware systems. Two possible ap-proaches have been explored: in one, the user requests information when needed (information pull), and in the other, the system automatically offers relevant informa-tion (<b>information</b> <b>push).</b> In this paper, we present our dialog management strategy for context-awareness us-ing an <b>information</b> <b>push</b> model.

Due to the domain-specific properties of blogging systems, however, searching relevant information is too difficult. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the user behaviors on blogspace, so that the channel between two similar users can be virtually generated. Eventually, social grid environment can be constructed on blog organization. We therefore propose a BlogGrid framework to provide the <b>information</b> <b>pushing</b> service without any user intervention. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the achieved research results within several {{national and international}} C 2 and information management projects to develop concepts for balancing the <b>information</b> <b>push</b> with an operator’s information {{need in order to}} meet the requirement to avoid / suppress information overload situations. The paper starts with an analysis and syntheses of the information overload problem. A model is used to describe the causes and the consequences of information overload on the operator’s behaviour and performance in a command information centre of naval vessels. Research has shown that an increasing amount of time is needed for gathering and discriminating relevant information from the actual <b>information</b> <b>push</b> while less time is left for analysing the relevant information in more details and taking correct and original decisions. Information overload is seen as a serious threat for the quality and performance of mission execution. The blueprint for an adaptive information management support concept is based on merging several information management support approaches: 1. Approaches to estimate and/or measure and control the operator’s information overload. 2. Information exchange concepts. 3. Information handling within several kind of tasks: Skill based, rule-based and knowledge-based tasks. Based on the complexity of the problem, an information management concept is discussed to control and filter the information flows adaptively for skill and rule dominated tasks...|$|R

Besides, by making use of contextual information of mobile devices, the recommendation service can generate user profiles automatically.
