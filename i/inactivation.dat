40|$|AbstractSeveral {{forms of}} motor learning, {{including}} classical conditioning of the eyeblink and nictitating membrane response (NMR), are {{dependent upon the}} cerebellum, {{but it is not}} known how motor memories are stored within the cerebellar circuitry. Localized infusions of the GABAA agonist muscimol were used to target putative consolidation processes by producing reversible <b>inactivations</b> after NMR conditioning sessions. Posttraining <b>inactivations</b> of eyeblink control regions in cerebellar cortical lobule HVI completely prevented conditioning from developing over four sessions. In contrast, similar <b>inactivations</b> of eyeblink control regions in the cerebellar nuclei allowed conditioning to develop normally. These findings provide evidence that there are critical posttraining memory consolidation processes for eyeblink conditioning mediated by the cerebellar cortex...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive {{senescence}} is {{a hallmark}} of aging. The molecular mechanisms regulating reproductive senescence and its association with the aging of somatic cells remain poorly understood. From a full genome RNA interference (RNAi) screen, we identified 32 Caenorhabditis elegans gene <b>inactivations</b> that delay reproductive senescence and extend reproductive lifespan. We found {{that many of these}} gene <b>inactivations</b> interact with insulin/IGF- 1 and/or TGF-b endocrine signaling pathways to regulate reproductive senescence, except nhx- 2 and sgk- 1 that modulate sodium reabsorption. Of these 32 gene <b>inactivations,</b> we also found that 19 increase reproductive lifespan through their effects on oocyte activities, 8 of them coordinate oocyte and sperm functions to extend reproductive lifespan, and 5 of them can induce sperm humoral response to promote reproductive longevity. Furthermore, we examined the effects of these reproductive aging regulators on somatic aging. We found that 5 of these gene <b>inactivations</b> prolong organismal lifespan, and 20 of them increase healthy life expectancy of an organism without altering total life span. These studies provide a systemic view on the genetic regulation of reproductive senescence and its intersection with organism longevity. The majority of these newly identified genes ar...|$|R

40|$|Genetic and RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) screens {{for life}} span regulatory genes {{have revealed that}} the daf- 2 insulin-like signaling pathway {{plays a major role}} in Caenorhabditis elegans longevity. This pathway converges on the DAF- 16 transcription factor and may regulate life span by controlling the expression of a large number of genes, including free-radical detoxifying genes, stress resistance genes, and pathogen resistance genes. We conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify genes necessary for the extended life span of daf- 2 mutants and identified ∼ 200 gene <b>inactivations</b> that shorten daf- 2 life span. Some of these gene <b>inactivations</b> dramatically shorten daf- 2 mutant life span but less dramatically shorten daf- 2; daf- 16 mutant or wild-type life span. Molecular and behavioral markers for normal aging and for extended life span in low insulin/IGF 1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) signaling were assayed to distinguish accelerated aging from general sickness and to examine age-related phenotypes. Detailed demographic analysis, molecular markers of aging, and insulin signaling mutant test strains were used to filter progeric gene <b>inactivations</b> for specific acceleration of aging. Highly represented in the genes that mediate life span extension in the daf- 2 mutant are components of endocytotic trafficking of membrane proteins to lysosomes. These gene <b>inactivations</b> disrupt the increased expression of the DAF- 16 downstream gene superoxide dismutase sod- 3 in a daf- 2 mutant, suggesting trafficking between the insulin-like receptor and DAF- 16. The activities of these genes may normally decline during aging...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies using}} {{muscimol}} <b>inactivations</b> in the frontal eye fields (FEFs) {{have shown that}} saccades generated by recall from working memory are eliminated by these lesions, whereas visually guided saccades are relatively spared. In these experiments, we made reversible <b>inactivations</b> in FEFs in alert macaque monkeys and examined the effect on saccades in a choice response task. Our task required monkeys to learn arbitrary pairings between colored stimuli and saccade direction. Following <b>inactivations,</b> the percentage of choice errors increased {{as a function of}} the number of alternative (NA) pairings. In contrast, the percentage of dysmetric saccades (saccades that landed in the correct quadrant but were inaccurate) did not vary with NA. Saccade latency increased postlesion but did not increase with NA. We also made simultaneous <b>inactivations</b> in both FEFs. The results following bilateral lesions showed approximately twice as many choice errors. We conclude that the FEFs are involved in the generation of saccades in choice response tasks. The dramatic effect of NA on choice errors, but the lack of an effect of NA on motor errors or response latency, suggests that two types of processing are interrupted by FEF lesions. The first involves the formation of a saccadic intention vector from associate memory inputs, and the second, the execution of the saccade from the intention vector. An alternative interpretation of the first result is that a role of the FEFs may be to suppress incorrect responses. The doubling of choice errors following bilateral FEF lesions suggests that the effect of unilateral lesions is not caused by a general inhibition of the lesioned side by the intact side...|$|R

5|$|The stomach has the {{characteristic}} pattern of sigmodontines (unilocular-hemiglandular); {{it is not}} split in two chambers by an incisura angularis and the front part (antrum) is covered by a glandular epithelium. The gall bladder is absent, a synapomorphy (shared-derived character) of Oryzomyini. The karyotype includes 56chromosomes and a fundamental number of 60chromosomal arms (2n=56, FN=60). The form of the sex chromosomes {{has been used to}} distinguish the marsh rice rat from Oryzomys couesi, but may be too variable among Oryzomys species to be useful in differentiating them. X chromosome <b>inactivation</b> occurs in the marsh rice rat, though the animal lacks LINE-1 retrotransposons, which have been suggested as components of the <b>inactivation</b> process. Mutants with fused or additional molars and with light fur have been recorded in laboratory colonies; the abnormal molars are apparently the result of a single autosomal recessive mutation. At about 50%, hematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells in the blood) is high in the marsh rice rat compared to other rodents; this may be an adaptation that enables the rice rat to increase oxygen capacity while swimming under water.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{their high}} DNA {{identity}} and {{a proposal to}} group classical Brucella species as biovars of B. melitensis, the commonly recognized Brucella species can be distinguished by distinct biochemical and fatty acid characters {{as well as by}} a marked host range (e. g. B. suis for swine, B. melitensis for sheep and goats, B. abortus for cattle). Here we present the genome of B. abortus 2308, the virulent prototype biovar 1 strain, and its comparison to the two other human pathogenic Brucellae species and to the B. abortus field isolate 9 - 941. The global distribution of pseudogenes, deletions and insertions support previous indications that B. abortus and B. melitensis share a common ancestor that diverged from B. suis. With the exception of a dozen genes, the genetic complement of both B. abortus strains is identical, whereas the three species differ in gene content and pseudogenes. The pattern of species-specific gene <b>inactivations</b> affecting transcriptional regulators and outer membrane proteins suggest that these <b>inactivations</b> may {{play an important role in}} the establishment of host-specificity and may have been a primary driver of speciation in the Brucellae. Despite being non-motile, the Brucellae contain flagellum gene clusters and display species-specific flagellar gene <b>inactivations,</b> which lead to the putative generation of different versions of flagellum-derived structures, and may contribute to differences in host-specificity and virulence. Metabolic changes such as the lack of complete metabolic pathways for the synthesis of numerous compounds (e. g. glycogen, biotin, NAD, and choline) are consistent with adaptation of Brucellae to an intracellular lifestyle...|$|R

25|$|The {{time period}} for X-chromosome <b>inactivation</b> {{explains}} this disparity. <b>Inactivation</b> {{occurs in the}} epiblast during gastrulation, which {{gives rise to the}} embryo. <b>Inactivation</b> occurs on a cellular level, resulting in a mosaic expression, in which patches of cells have an inactive maternal X-chromosome, while other patches have an inactive paternal X-chromosome. For example, a female heterozygous for haemophilia (an X-linked disease) would have about half of her liver cells functioning properly, which is typically enough to ensure normal blood clotting. Chance could result in significantly more dysfunctional cells; however, such statistical extremes are unlikely. Genetic differences on the chromosome may also render one X-chromosome more likely to undergo <b>inactivation.</b> Also, if one X-chromosome has a mutation hindering its growth or rendering it non viable, cells which randomly inactivated that X will have a selective advantage over cells which randomly inactivated the normal allele. Thus, although <b>inactivation</b> is initially random, cells that inactivate a normal allele (leaving the mutated allele active) will eventually be overgrown and replaced by functionally normal cells in which nearly all have the same X-chromosome activated.|$|E
