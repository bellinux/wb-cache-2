40|$|AbstractExhaust {{efficiency}} in tunnel fires with mechanical means was discussed. Heat <b>exhaust</b> efficiency and smoke <b>exhaust</b> efficiency were defined and studied under two different <b>exhaust</b> modes (longitudinal <b>exhaust</b> and transverse <b>exhaust)</b> respectively. <b>Exhaust</b> efficiency depends on smoke generation rate, <b>exhaust</b> rate, heat loss through walls of tunnel, configuration of extraction installations and so on. Under smoke extraction, smoke <b>exhaust</b> efficiency equals 1 if a quasi-steady vented stage without upstream outflow forms, otherwise smoke <b>exhaust</b> efficiency {{is less than}} 1. Heat <b>exhaust</b> efficiency is always less than 1 since part of the heat released by the fire is lost through the solid boundaries of tunnel by radiative and convective heat transfer between the smoke and ceiling lining. Based on experimental data obtained {{from a series of}} fire tests in a model tunnel, heat <b>exhaust</b> efficiency was estimated and influencing factors were discussed. In tunnel fires with transverse mechanical <b>exhaust</b> system, heat <b>exhaust</b> efficiency varies from 20 % to 50 %. Heat <b>exhaust</b> {{efficiency in}}creases along with the reduction of the number of <b>exhaust</b> inlets turned on while extracting and decreases along with the increase of the area of <b>exhaust</b> inlet. However, quantitative influence of inlet position on <b>exhaust</b> efficiency still need further study and will be reported later...|$|R

50|$|The {{magnitude}} of the <b>exhaust</b> scavenging effect is a direct function of the velocity of the high and medium pressure components of the <b>exhaust</b> pulse. Performance headers work to increase the <b>exhaust</b> velocity as much as possible. One technique is tuned-length primary tubes. This technique attempts to time the occurrence of each <b>exhaust</b> pulse, to occur {{one after the other}} in succession while still in the <b>exhaust</b> system. The lower pressure tail of an <b>exhaust</b> pulse then serves to create a greater pressure difference between the high pressure head of the next <b>exhaust</b> pulse, thus increasing the velocity of that <b>exhaust</b> pulse. In V6 and V8 engines where {{there is more than one}} <b>exhaust</b> bank, 'Y-pipes' and 'X-pipes' work on the same principle of using the low pressure component of an <b>exhaust</b> pulse to increase the velocity of the next <b>exhaust</b> pulse.|$|R

5|$|Debate exists {{over the}} {{significance}} and {{outcome of the}} battle. The German forces destroyed many Soviet tanks and temporarily degraded the striking power of the 5th Guards Tank Army, but {{they were unable to}} take Prokhorovka or break through into open ground before developments elsewhere forced the termination of Operation Citadel. For the Soviet side, the massive armoured attack of 12 July failed to destroy the II SS-Panzer Corps, but succeeded in <b>exhausting</b> the Germans and eventually contributed to checking their advance. Thus, neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS-Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives for 12 July.|$|E

50|$|Early/late <b>exhaust</b> valve closingEarly {{and late}} <b>exhaust</b> valve closing can also reduce emissions. Traditionally, the <b>exhaust</b> valve opens, and <b>exhaust</b> gas is {{pushed out of}} the {{cylinder}} and into the <b>exhaust</b> manifold by the piston as it travels upward. By manipulating {{the timing of the}} <b>exhaust</b> valve, engineers can control how much <b>exhaust</b> gas is left in the cylinder. By holding the <b>exhaust</b> valve open slightly longer, the cylinder is emptied more and ready to be filled with a bigger air/fuel charge on the intake stroke. By closing the valve slightly early, more <b>exhaust</b> gas remains in the cylinder which increases fuel efficiency. This allows for more efficient operation under all conditions.|$|R

5|$|Moving {{troops to}} the front ahead of the attack was {{nonetheless}} extremely difficult, as {{the only means of}} approaching the front line were narrow boardwalks made of wood planking, which wound between the shell-holes. Slipping off the duckboards could often be deadly with unfortunate soldiers frequently drowning in mud under the weight of their own equipment.

50|$|<b>Exhaust</b> brakes are simpler in {{operation}} than an engine brake. Essentially, the <b>exhaust</b> pipe {{of the vehicle}} is restricted by a valve. This raises the pressure in the <b>exhaust</b> system, forcing the engine to work harder on the <b>exhaust</b> stroke of its cylinders, so again the engine is acting as an air compressor, with the power required to compress the air being withheld from the <b>exhaust</b> pipe, retarding the vehicle. Turbocharger retarders that restrict the flow of <b>exhaust</b> gas can also help in increasing the <b>exhaust</b> pressure {{to achieve the same}} objective.|$|R

5000|$|These {{conflicting}} {{requirements are}} reconciled by constructing the <b>exhaust</b> pipe with diverging and converging conical sections to create pressure wave reflections which travel {{back up the}} pipe and are presented at the <b>exhaust</b> port. The <b>exhaust</b> port opens while there is still significant pressure in the cylinder, which drives the initial outflow of <b>exhaust.</b> As the pressure wave from the pulse of <b>exhaust</b> gas travels down the pipe, it encounters a diverging conical section; this causes a wave of negative pressure to be reflected back up the pipe, which arrives at the <b>exhaust</b> port {{towards the end of}} the <b>exhaust</b> phase, when the cylinder pressure has fallen to a low level, and helps to draw the remaining <b>exhaust</b> gas out of the cylinder. Further along the <b>exhaust</b> pipe, the <b>exhaust</b> pressure wave encounters a converging conical section, and this reflects a positive pressure wave back up the pipe. This wave is timed to arrive at the <b>exhaust</b> port after scavenging is completed, thereby [...] "plugging" [...] the <b>exhaust</b> port to prevent spillage of fresh charge, and indeed may also push back into the cylinder any charge which has already spilled.|$|R
50|$|An <b>exhaust</b> brake is {{a device}} that {{essentially}} creates a major restriction in the <b>exhaust</b> system, and creates substantial <b>exhaust</b> back pressure to retard engine speed and offer some supplemental braking. In most cases, an <b>exhaust</b> brake is so effective that it can slow a heavily loaded vehicle on a downgrade without ever applying the vehicle's service brakes. <b>Exhaust</b> brakes are manufactured by many companies. The brakes vary in design, but essentially operate as described above. More advanced <b>exhaust</b> brakes have <b>exhaust</b> pressure modulation (EPM) that controls the back pressure which in turn improves the braking performance {{across a range of}} engine speeds.|$|R
50|$|The primary <b>exhaust</b> {{rocker arm}} {{contacts}} a low-profile camshaft lobe during low-RPM engine operation. Once VTEC engagement occurs, the oil pressure {{flowing from the}} <b>exhaust</b> rocker shaft into the primary <b>exhaust</b> rocker arm forces the VTEC switching piston into the secondary <b>exhaust</b> rocker arm, thereby locking both <b>exhaust</b> rocker arms together. The high-profile camshaft lobe which normally contacts the secondary <b>exhaust</b> rocker arm alone during low-RPM engine operation is able to move both <b>exhaust</b> rocker arms together which are locked as a unit. The same occurs for the intake rocker shaft, except that the high-profile camshaft lobe operates the primary rocker arm.|$|R
