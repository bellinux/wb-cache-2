50|$|<b>Heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> is {{available}} {{in a variety of}} colors for color-coding of wires and connections. In the early twenty-first century <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> started to be used for PC modding to tidy up the interior of computers and provide an appearance considered pleasing. In response to this opening market, manufacturers started producing <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> in luminous and UV reactive varieties.|$|E

5000|$|Cryoloops are cooling {{devices that}} use 23 gauge {{stainless}} steel hypodermic tubing shaped into a loop that can fit into sulci {{or on the}} gyri of the section of interest of the cerebral cortex. A pump draws methanol from a reservoir, and the fluid flows through a dry ice bath to be cooled. The cooled methanol flows through Teflon tubing into the cryoloop’s metal tubing, which is secured by passing through a threaded post. A thermocouple connector receives the wires from a microthermocouple {{at the base of}} the loop (where the inflow and outflow tubes meet) that measures the tubing temperature. The post, the thermocouple connector, and <b>heat-shrink</b> Teflon <b>tubing,</b> which envelopes the microthermocouple wires and the inflow and outflow tubes between the post and microthermocouple, are sealed using dental acrylic. [...] After implantation, when the animal is not participating in an experiment, a protective cap is placed over the open inflow and outflow tubes. During experimentation, the inflow and outflow tubes are attached to the Teflon tubing connected to the reservoir setup. The thermocouple connector is connected to a switchbox and a thermometer so cryoloop temperature can be monitored. [...] Cryoloops are considered the most adaptable form of cooling available due to the customization necessary for each experiment. The investigator must form the functional cooling loop of the cryoloop to fit with whatever part of the brain he/she wishes to study, and several cryoloops can be used for one brain. Each device can cool a range of tissue areas from less than 10 mm3 to 75 mm3. Although it may be considered a hassle to have to form each device for each section of interest, this customization allows for a more controlled region of cooling and for more efficient animal use because of the possibility for multiple cooling sites within each animal. Head restraint is unnecessary because the loops are chronically implanted and secured to the skull by screws and dental acrylic.|$|R

5000|$|Specialty <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing,</b> {{known as}} [...] "solder sleeves", have {{a tube of}} solder inside of the <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing,</b> {{allowing}} the heat source to electrically join the two wires by melting the solder and simultaneously insulate the junction with the tubing. Solder sleeves also commonly contain a ring of heat-activated sealant {{on the inside of}} each end of the tubing, allowing the connection to also be made waterproof.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> is {{manufactured}} in {{a multitude of}} varieties and chemical makeups with the exact composition of each type being dependent on the intended application. From near microscopically-thin-wall tubing to rigid, heavy-wall tubing, each type has precise design and chemical additives that make it suitable for meeting any {{of a wide variety}} of environmental demands. <b>Heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> is rated by its expansion ratio, a comparison of the differences in expansion and recovery rate.|$|E
50|$|Although usually {{used for}} insulation, <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> with a {{conductive}} lining is also available, {{for use on}} joints which are not soldered.|$|E
50|$|Polyolefins {{are used}} for blow moulded or {{rotationally}} moulded components, e.g. toys, for <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> used to mechanically and electrically protect connections in electronics, and for rash guards or undergarments for wetsuits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> {{was invented}} by Raychem Corporation in 1962. It is {{manufactured}} from a thermoplastic material such as polyolefin, fluoropolymer (such as FEP, PTFE or Kynar), PVC, neoprene, silicone elastomer or Viton.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> (or, commonly, {{heat shrink}} or heatshrink) is a {{shrinkable}} plastic tube used to insulate wires, providing abrasion resistance {{and environmental protection}} for stranded and solid wire conductors, connections, joints and terminals in electrical work. It {{can also be used}} to repair the insulation on wires or to bundle them together, to protect wires or small parts from minor abrasion, and to create cable entry seals, offering environmental sealing protection. <b>Heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> is ordinarily made of nylon or polyolefin, which shrinks radially (but not longitudinally) when heated, to between one-half and one-sixth of its diameter.|$|E
50|$|Most {{examples}} were wound with {{copper wire}} using a fiberglass rod as a former. This flexible radiator is then covered with <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> {{which provides a}} resilient and rugged waterproof covering for the finished mobile antenna.|$|E
5000|$|Fluorinated {{ethylene}} propylene (FEP) is a lower-cost {{alternative to}} PTFE. It is a versatile electrical insulator and is inert to most chemicals and solvents. Additionally, {{it is highly}} resistant to extreme heat, cold, and Ultraviolet radiation, making it an excellent material for <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> applications.|$|E
50|$|It is {{difficult}} to find information relating to Foster-Miller's earliest years, but its recent performance is well documented and quite extensive. Some of the earliest developments were in jet spray dispensers in vending machines and Velcro/Raychem (<b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing)</b> molding machines. They developed ballistic nets in the 1990s and overhead/underground power line, underground piping, and nuclear steam generator maintenance robots ("guided mole").|$|E
50|$|Shrink wrap is {{commonly}} used as an overwrap on many types of packaging, including cartons, boxes, beverage cans and pallet loads. A variety of products may be enclosed in shrink wrap to stabilize the products, unitize them, keep them clean or add tamper resistance. It can be the primary covering for some foods such as cheese, meats, vegetables and plants. <b>Heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> is used to seal electric wiring.|$|E
5000|$|Teflon tape stretching: The {{existing}} jewelry {{is removed}} {{and a thin}} layer of non-adhesive Teflon tape (PFTE tape), which is inert and safe for piercing use, is wrapped around the jewelry. Non-adhesive bondage tape and <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> are also frequently used. [...] The jewelry is then re-inserted, and as the piercing adapts to the new diameter of jewelry, the process is repeated with increasingly thicker layers of tape.|$|E
50|$|All opto-isolators {{described}} {{so far are}} uni-directional. Optical channel always works one way, {{from the}} source (LED) to the sensor. The sensors, be it photoresistors, photodiodes or phototransistors, cannot emit light. But LEDs, like all semiconductor diodes, are capable of detecting incoming light, which makes possible construction of a two-way opto-isolator {{from a pair of}} LEDs. The simplest bidirectional opto-isolator is merely a pair of LEDs placed face to face and held together with <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing.</b> If necessary, the gap between two LEDs can be extended with a glass fiber insert.|$|E
5000|$|Polyolefin tubes, {{the most}} common kind, have maximum continuous-use {{temperatures}} from -55 to 135 °C, and are used by the military, aerospace and railway industries. They are flexible and fast-shrinking, and manufactured {{in a wide range}} of colors (including clear), which can be used for color-coding wires. With the exception of black, they tend to have lower resistance to ultraviolet light; accordingly, only black is recommended for outdoor applications. Polyolefin tubing shrinks at 143°C. Polyolefin <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> typically shrinks 2:1 diametrically, but high-grade polyolefin heat-shrink is also available with a 3:1 ratio. Polyolefin tubing may withstand being touched with a soldering iron.|$|E
50|$|The {{process for}} making <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> is as follows: First the {{material}} is chosen based on its properties. The material is often compounded with other additives (such as colorants, stabilizers, etc.) depending on the application. A starting tube is extruded from the raw material. Next, the tube is taken to a separate process where it is cross-linked, usually through radiation. The cross-linking creates a memory in the tube. Then the tube is heated to just above the polymer's crystalline melting point and expanded in diameter, often by placing it in a vacuum chamber. While in the expanded state it is rapidly cooled. Later, when heated (above the crystalline melting point of the material) by the end user, the tubing shrinks back to its original extruded size.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the reed}} has dried, the wires are {{tightened}} around the reed, which has shrunk after drying, or replaced completely. The lower part is sealed (a nitrocellulose-based cement such as Duco may be used) and then wrapped with thread to ensure both that no air leaks {{out through the}} bottom of the reed and that the reed maintains its shape. The wrapping itself is often sealed with Duco or clear nail varnish (polish). Electrical tape can also be used as a wrapping for amateur reed makers. The bulge in the wrapping is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Turk's head"—it serves as a convenient handle when inserting the reed on the bocal.Recently, more players are choosing the more modern <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> instead of the time-consuming and fiddly thread.|$|E
50|$|The unshrunk tubing is fitted on {{the wire}} before making the connection, then slid down to cover the joint after it is made. If the fit is tight, {{silicone}} lubricant can be applied without compromising the heat-shrink material. The tubing is then shrunk to wrap tightly around the joint by heating in an oven or with a hot air gun or other source of hot gas flow. Convenient but less consistent methods for shrinking the tube include a soldering iron held close to but not touching the tube, or the heat from a lighter. Uncontrolled heat can cause uneven shrinkage, physical damage and insulation failure, and these methods are not recommended by heatshrink suppliers. If overheated, <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> can melt, scorch or catch fire like any other plastic. Heating causes the tubing to contract to between half and one sixth of its original diameter, depending on the material used, providing a snug fit over irregularly shaped joints. There is also longitudinal shrinking, usually unwanted {{and to a lesser}} extent than narrowing, of typically around 6%. The tubing provides good electrical insulation, protection from dust, solvents and other foreign materials, and mechanical strain relief, and is mechanically held in place (unless incorrectly oversized or not properly shrunk) by its tight fit.|$|E
5000|$|Radial leads project {{more or less}} in {{parallel}} from the same surface or aspect of a component package, rather than from opposite ends of the package. Originally, radial leads were defined as more-or-less following a radius of a cylindrical component (such as a ceramic disk capacitor). [...] Over time, this definition was generalized in contrast to axial leads, and took on its current form. When placed on a board, radial components [...] "stand up" [...] perpendicular, occupying a smaller footprint on sometimes-scarce [...] "board real estate", making them useful in many high-density designs. The parallel leads projecting from a single mounting surface gives radial components an overall [...] "plugin-nature", facilitating their use in high-speed automated component insertion ("board-stuffing") machines.When needed, an axial component can be effectively converted into a radial component, by bending one of its leads into a [...] "U" [...] shape so that it ends up close to and parallel with the other lead. Extra insulation with <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> may be used to prevent shorting out on nearby components. Conversely, a radial component can be pressed into service as an axial component by separating its leads as far as possible, and extending them into an overall length-spanning shape. These improvisations are often seen in breadboard or prototype construction, but are deprecated for mass production designs. This is because of difficulties in use with automated component placement machinery, and poorer reliability because of reduced vibration and mechanical shock resistance in the completed assembly.|$|E
40|$|The balloon {{catheters}} produced by Boston Scientific are manufactured using a laser bonding process. The behaviour {{of the materials}} during this laser welding process is not very well understood. In this work a computational model of this process was created which will help predict the behaviour of the materials during bonding and will increase understanding of the laser bonding process. The two parts being bonded are cylindrical and are both made of a thermoplastic polymer called PEBAXÂ®. During the bonding process, these cylindrical parts are surrounded by a <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> which applies a pressure to the PEBAXÂ® parts when heated. The heat and pressure cause the PEBAXÂ® to melt and flow. Modelling the <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> and the melt flow during the laser welding process are key aims of this work. A thermal model of the process was created by modelling the laser absorption and heat transfer through the assembly. This was compared with previous work and validated with experimental data. The PEBAXÂ® was modelled as a viscoelastic material which transitions from relatively rigid to very compliant as it passes its melting temperature. Extensive experimental testing was performed to characterise the <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing.</b> The <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> was modelled using two shape memory models from the literature. These two models were implemented into Abaqus FEA using two user defined material subroutines (UMATs). A thermo-mechanical finite element model of the bonding process was then created in Abaqus FEA {{and the results were}} compared with experimental data. This model captures the overall behaviour of the materials during the bonding process, providing predictions of melt flow. The results are compared with the experimentally observed melt flow providing new knowledge on the thermo-mechanical behaviour during the laser bonding process of {{balloon catheters}}...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{check valve}} {{featuring}} adhesiveless packaging in <b>heat-shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> and dual regulation of in-plane flow is presented. The modular design enables simple replacement of valve components to modify valve behavior and performance. The specific design {{is intended for}} low-profile fluidic applica-tions requiring flow control, such as drug delivery devices. The heat-shrink packaging scheme is extremely robust and can with-stand> 2000 mmHg (266. 6 kPa) without leakage. Three different valve geometries were investigated and evaluated with theoretical and finite-element modeling analyses. Repeated flow regulation experiments on a fully packaged, hydrated valve demonstrated flow regulation between 25 and 2000 mmHg (3. 33 – 266. 6 kPa) and leak-free closure up to 500 mmHg (66. 7 kPa) of reverse pressure with no observed stiction.

40|$|Implantable {{cardiovascular}} {{devices are}} manufactured from artificial materials (e. g. titanium (Ti), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene), which pose {{the risk of}} thromboemboli formation 1, 2, 3. We have developed a method to line the inside surface of Ti tubes with autologous blood-derived human or porcine endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) 4. By implanting Ti tubes containing a confluent layer of porcine EPCs in the inferior vena cava (IVC) of pigs, we tested the improved biocompatibility of the cell-seeded surface in the prothrombotic environment of a large animal model and compared it to unmodified bare metal surfaces 5, 6, 7 (Figure 1).
