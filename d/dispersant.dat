Although there is growing acceptance of <b>dispersants</b> as a counter measure to marine oil spills around the world, the two major issues with the <b>dispersants</b> are their toxicity to marine life and dispersion effectiveness (DE) for crude-oil, especially for heavy oil. To develop more efficient and less toxic <b>dispersants,</b> two kinds of sorbitol derivant nonionic surfactant (polysorbate 85 and sorbeth- 40 tetraoleate), two kinds of glycolipid biosurfactants (rham-nolipid and sophorolipid) and less toxic solvent ethylene glycol butyl ether were chosen in this study, and two disper-sant formulations were optimized by uniform design methods.

In the Barents Sea {{this issue is}} of high concern as large oil spills can cause transboundary pollution, affecting the interests of two neighbouring countries. The Joint Contingency Plan in the Barents Sea does not set any specific requirements for use of <b>dispersants</b> and lets Norway and Russia follow their national procedures. The Plan emphasizes that in case of transboundary pollution {{the decision to use}} <b>dispersants</b> shall only be undertaken upon common agreement. The paper presents a comparison of the national regulatory approaches of Norway and Russia to using <b>dispersants.</b> The research is based on the analysis of legislative documents and interviews with oil companies, oil spill responders and relevant national authorities. The research reveals that in both countries use of <b>dispersants</b> requires preliminary authorization of the national agencies. In Norway the pre-approval procedure and the algorithm of <b>dispersants</b> involvement in response to a real accident are clearly documented and are regularly tested. This has made the process of approval for using <b>dispersants</b> more efficient. In Russia the lack of practical experience in using <b>dispersants</b> and well-established approval procedures can result in a long and unclear permitting process for each oil spill case. This could seriously hinder the use of <b>dispersants</b> to combat transboundary pollution in the Barents Sea, even if it is considered to be beneficial.
