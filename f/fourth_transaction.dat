40|$|The {{following}} paper {{analyzes the}} outsourcing, offshoring, and offshore out-sourcing of accounting following {{the passage of}} the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). The outsourcing of accounting services is growing at a phenom-enal pace and is affecting firms of all sizes, regardless of industry or market capitalization. This is leading to a strategic shift in what, where, and by whom accounting services are performed. The outsourcing of accounting following SOX is analyzed in five areas: First, the initial impact of SOX on onshore and offshore outsourcing of accounting, in particular, the emergence of India as a major destination for offshore outsourcing. Second, the outsourcing of accounting services in small and medium sized firms; in addition, the applica-tion of outsourcing theory as a metric to gauge sourcing decisions. Third, ac-counting pronouncements which impact the desirability to outsource account-ing following SOX. <b>Fourth,</b> <b>transaction</b> cost economics and its application to the outsourcing of accounting. Last, the emergence of global accountin...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} a new method for replicating and pricing the quality options usually embedded in many future contracts. The replicating strategies may draw {{on both the}} future contract {{as well as its}} related calls and puts. They also yield the quality option theoretical price in perfect markets, as well as upper and lower bounds for its bid or ask prices if frictions are incorporated. With respect to previous literature, this new approach seems to reflect five contributions: First, the analysis does not depend on any dynamic assumption concerning the Term Structure of Interest Rates (TSIR) behaviour; second, it incorporates the information contained in calls and puts on the future contract; third, it allows us to use real market perfectly synchronized prices; <b>fourth,</b> <b>transaction</b> costs can be considered and, finally, this article shows that the quality option may be a useful security in the portfolio of many traders. These traders will make the future contract more effective as a hedging instrument. This article also presents an empirical test involving the German market. ...|$|E
40|$|This article aims to {{characterize}} Russian commercial {{organizations that are}} trading bovine meat from Brazil. It is a exploratory qualitative study. During the field work {{it was possible to}} conduct 14 interviews with Russian and Brazilian traders, from 01 st until 12 th of December/ 2008. It was found that traders developed four different types of transaction configurations. The first configuration described is the one with the highest number of organizations involved in the trading activities. It is a transaction configuration that aloud higher levels of specialization for the different trading firms, making possible for Russian wholesalers and retailers to buy from Brazilian abattoirs intermediated by international trading organizations. In the second observed configuration it was possible to perceive a more active role of the Russian wholesaler, since this category of organization was able to absorb the trading operations that where performed by an international trading company. In the third transaction confiuration a trading company licensed to trade with Russian retailers is the only intermediary between Brazilian exporters and retailers. The <b>fourth</b> <b>transaction</b> configuration has a Russian retailer trading directly with a Brazilian supplier of bovine meat...|$|E
40|$|This paper takes a {{step towards}} formalizing the {{theoretical}} interconnections among four post-Industrial Revolution phenomena – the industrialization and growth take-off of rich 'northern' nations, massive global income divergence, and rapid trade expansion. Specifically, we present a stages-of-growth model in which the four phenomena are jointly endogenous and all are triggered by a gradual fall {{in the cost of}} trading goods internationally. In the first stage, while trade costs are high, industry is dispersed and growth is low. In the second stage, the north industrializes rapidly, growth takes off and the south diverges. In the third stage, high growth and global divergence become self sustaining. We then show that, in a <b>fourth</b> stage, when <b>transaction</b> costs on “trading” ideas have sufficiently decreased, the south can quickly industrialize and converge...|$|R
40|$|Interaction {{of objects}} in today's {{object-oriented}} database systems is based on four premises: First, messages are procedures, which are executed instantaneously. Second, interaction is limited to two objects, a client and a server. Third, communication contexts are defined algorithmically by procedures [...] - or at top level [...] - by <b>transactions.</b> <b>Fourth,</b> all objects are globally accessible {{no matter where they}} physically reside in a computer network (location transparency). We argue in this paper that this paradigm of object interaction does not suffice for large-scale cooperative and distributed applications such as computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM), distributed artificial intelligence (DAI), or office automation which are characterized, on the one hand, by autonomously acting agents which allow for the necessary high degree of specialization to meet local computing requirements and, on the other hand, by the need for coordination among these agents. As a remedy we propose a strict [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at an IMF seminar on November 2, 2010 The paper addresses the following puzzle. On the one hand, trading in asset markets has become progressively more short-term oriented, {{on the other}} hand, asset prices have continued to move in a sequence of “bull markets ” and “bear markets”, often lasting several years. The main results of the paper are as follows. First, "bull (bear) markets " are brought about by upward (downward) price runs lasting longer than counter-movements {{for an extended period}} of time. Second, this pattern is the result of “trading as usual”, which employs so-called “technical analysis ” to exploit asset price trends and, in doing so, reinforces the price trends. Third, the recent financial crisis spilled over to the real economy mainly through the coincidence of three “bear markets”, i. e., through the simultaneous devaluation of stock, housing and commodity wealth. <b>Fourth,</b> a financial <b>transactions</b> tax (FTT) would specifically reduce the profitability of short-term derivatives trading. By doing so, a FTT would limit the magnitude of the “long swings ” in asset prices. Fifth, an FTT need not to be introduced globally, there do exist options which would allow “forerunner countries ” to introduce such a tax without doing much harm to their financial markets...|$|R
40|$|Translation as an {{activity}} that promotes communication among people speaking different languages {{has a long history}} and a unique complexity in India: its 2000 years of history; India’s greater complexity than Europe’s in the multiplicity of major languages - 1652 living languages, 22 listed as major, 24 State languages and 4 classical. This linguistic complexity has demanded interconnectivity and communicability in a vast, distinct sociocultural- political entity through a pan-Indian language of learning creative expression and a multi-directional translation activity involving several kinds of translation situations with characteristic problems of translating. To understand the ‘translatology’ of this complexity, analytical parameters are needed. One can identify reasons/motivations for translation – renewal, diffusion and borrowing. Then there is the direction of translatingtransaction as an index of the cultural-intellectual status of languages involved, that is, the philosophy of translation. Third, there is the cline of difficulty and nature of difficulty in the <b>transaction.</b> <b>Fourth,</b> if translation involves displacement, there is also the double and possibly even three-fold displacement. Finally, translation is an index of the contemporary culture of a country –that translation-culture of a country at a given time is an index of its intellect, sociology and politics. We dwell on the Indian translation scene in this overall perspective...|$|R
40|$|The paper uses a {{consequential}} {{perspective to}} explore the design features of a target-effective general anti-avoidance rule (2 ̆ 2 GAAR 2 ̆ 2). As emphasized by David Weisbach, this perspective frames tax-avoidance activity {{in terms of its}} allocative and distributional effects. Most importantly, it supports the proposition that {{there is nothing in the}} consequential attributes of tax avoidance that justify its acceptance by tax policymakers. Instead, tax avoidance should be viewed as a negative externality, and externality theory suggests appropriate policy instruments that can be used to eliminate the consequential attributes of avoidance behavior. Different types of tax avoidance present, however, different identification issues that, in fact, lie at the core of the different concepts of tax avoidance that are the focus of economics and law. It is suggested that a target-effective behavioral prohibition can only be realistically realized in the form of a GAAR. In assessing the content of a GAAR, the paper makes four separate, but related, points. First, the distinction between GAARs, as currently conceived, and judicially-created anti-avoidance doctrines is an overly sharp one, with both forms of behavioral prohibition suffering from problems of under-inclusiveness, albeit for different reasons. Second, the relevance of the statutory interpretation exercise in the identification of prohibited behavior should be much more limited than is currently the case. Third, two different concepts of economic substance provide the basis for a legislative response tailored to apply differently to different types of tax-avoidance <b>transactions.</b> <b>Fourth,</b> the judiciary has the institutional competence to apply and enforce a GAAR, or articulate anti-avoidance doctrines, as a response to tax-attribute creation and tax-attribute trading transactions; but such competence is much more limited with instances of transactional substitution. This type of tax-avoidance activity presents many of the same identification difficulties presented by real behavioral adjustments to taxation, which are the focus of the concept of tax avoidance in economics. Except for a limited range of transactional substitutions that are equivalent to synthetic replication, the associated informational requirements are not amenable to the application and enforcement of a purpose-based behavioral prohibition. Transactional substitutions beyond this limited range should be addressed by the legislative and executive branches of government in discharging their policymaking function...|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{governance}} {{reform has}} become a topic of considerable debate both in the US and in many emerging markets. Indeed, the discussion is important because these reforms may have potentially long-standing effects upon the global allocation of capital, and in understanding {{the ways in which}} governance norms are communicated across markets and nations in an ever-globalizing world. In this chapter we examine the corporate governance reform efforts of the world 2 ̆ 7 s two biggest and fastest growing emerging markets, the People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China (PRC or China) and India. In the process we find that our understanding of how and why corporate governance reform comes about, where it leads, and what value it has can vary significantly, but still shares some commonalities that are of considerable theoretical and practical importance. The inquiry commenced in this chapter is inspired by certain key facts. First, China and India are growing at a remarkable and unprecedented pace and seem to have survived the 2008 - 9 Global Financial Crisis better than most other economies. Second, China and India are not Western countries, but have been heavily influenced by 2 ̆ 2 globalized 2 ̆ 2 Anglo-American notions of corporate law, corporate governance norms, and securities regulation. Third, China and India are presently two of the most popular destinations·for foreign capital in the world - whether via foreign direct investment (FDI) in essentially private (or pre-public) transactions or public capital markets <b>transactions.</b> <b>Fourth,</b> both India and China have undergone, and are progressing through, incredibly important (indeed world -changing) programs of economic reform and restructuring. At the same time they are increasingly - in the Chinese phrase - 2 ̆ 2 opening to the outside world. 2 ̆ 2 These are the shared 2 ̆ 2 facts 2 ̆ 2 of our inquiry, which of course are met by many deep differences, in particular relating to the history, internal organization and political and economic structures of the two great nation­civilizations. However, we believe that the common 2 ̆ 2 facts 2 ̆ 2 recited above - rapid economic development, significant private and public foreign investment, economic, structural and legal/regulatory reform, speedy recovery from the Global Financial Crisis, and a shared interest in (if not implementation of) in essentially Anglo-American corporate law norms -provide an interesting and rich platform for consideration of popular or contested corporate governance and corporate governance reform precepts...|$|R
