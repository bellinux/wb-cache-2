500|$|Due to a {{combination}} of the threat from CAF aircraft, US Navy PT boats stationed at Tulagi, and a cycle of bright moonlight, the Japanese had switched to using submarines to deliver provisions to their forces on Guadalcanal. [...] Beginning on November 16, 1942, and continuing for the next three weeks, 16submarines made nocturnal deliveries of foodstuffs to the island, with one submarine making the trip each night. [...] Each submarine could deliver 20 to 30tons of supplies, about one day's worth of food, for the 17th Army, but the difficult task of transporting the supplies by <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> jungle to the frontline units limited their value to sustain the Japanese troops on Guadalcanal.

500|$|During {{the first}} years of the war, forces of the regency prevailed. In the wake of several anti-aristocratic uprisings, most notably that of the Zealots in Thessalonica, a {{majority}} [...] of the cities in Thrace and Macedonia came under regency control. With assistance from Stefan Dušan of Serbia and Umur Beg of Aydin, Kantakouzenos successfully reversed these gains. By 1345, despite Dušan's defection to the opposition and the withdrawal of Umur, Kantakouzenos retained the upper <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> assistance of Orhan, ruler of the Ottoman emirate. The June 1345 murder of megas doux Apokaukos, the regency's chief administrator, dealt the regency a severe blow. Formally crowned as emperor in Adrianople in 1346, Kantakouzenos entered Constantinople on 3 February 1347. By agreement, he was to rule for ten years as the senior emperor and regent for John V, until the boy came of age and ruled alongside him. Despite this apparent victory, subsequent resumption of the civil war forced John VI Kantakouzenos to abdicate and retire to become a monk in 1354.|$|E

This causes Andy to have sexual performance difficulties with Erin. Erin asks Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{if he had}} similar problems after his loss of the manager position, which he denies. After Dwight tells Nellie that she has affected Andy's sex life, she begins to feel guilty. She holds a meeting where the office workers share {{advice on how to}} sexually perform. After the meeting, when Nellie makes another innuendo about Andy's problems, Erin loses her temper by yelling at Nellie to shut up, throwing her office phone to the ground, followed by Nellie's memo forms, pens, and her caramel. This gives Andy, filled with anger, the freedom to vent by throwing his desk chair at Robert, throwing Nellie's picture frame to the ground, and finally punching his <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wall (echoing his behavior in the third season episode [...] "The Return").

She sees her teachers rigging the election to prevent Cook from winning, and reveals this to the form when she is announced the winner. As his first presidential act, Cook starts a riot. In the ensuing chaos, Naomi forgives Kieran, encouraging him that if he likes her mother, he should tell her so. Naomi begins to have sex with Cook before she realises that it [...] "isn't right". Surprisingly, Cook doesn't seem to mind, as he says that she must have a good reason not to follow through because she's clever. Naomi leaves, with her and Cook now sharing a better understanding of each other. That night, she visits Emily's house, but Emily refuses to open the door, not wanting Naomi to see her after she had been crying.
