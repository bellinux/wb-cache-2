25|$|These tall {{sulphide}} chimneys (hydrothermal vents) host some unique ecological communities. While most of {{the deep}} sea depends on near-surface productivity with photosynthesis as its <b>fundamental</b> <b>energy</b> source, vent communities are completely independent from the surface and sunlight. Bacteria are able to use reduced compounds from the vent effluent as an energy source (chemosynthesis). These bacteria can be free-living or symbiotic and are {{the base of the}} food web of these communities where 90% of the species are endemic to this special environment. The tubeworm Ridgeia piscesae grows in large colonies in diffuse venting areas, supported by the symbiotic chemosynthetic bacteria developing in their cells. These worms have no mouth and rely on their internal symbiotic bacteria to survive. Other species living within hydrothermal communities include limpets, worms (scale worms and sulphide worms), fish, and sea spiders.|$|E
25|$|The above {{concepts}} all appear {{limited to}} high, but still sub-relativistic speeds, due to <b>fundamental</b> <b>energy</b> and reaction mass considerations, and all would entail trip times {{which might be}} enabled by space colonization technology, permitting self-contained habitats with lifetimes of decades to centuries. Yet human interstellar expansion at average speeds of even 0.1% of c would permit settlement of the entire Galaxy in less than one half of a galactic rotation period of ~250,000,000 years, which {{is comparable to the}} timescale of other galactic processes. Thus, even if interstellar travel at near relativistic speeds is never feasible (which cannot be clearly determined at this time), the development of space colonization could allow human expansion beyond the Solar System without requiring technological advances that cannot yet be reasonably foreseen. This could greatly improve the chances for the survival of intelligent life over cosmic timescales, given the many natural and human-related hazards that have been widely noted.|$|E

We also confirm the relation of spin-up torque versus luminosity in this source during the giant outburst. The hard X-ray spectral properties of 4 U 0115 + 63 during the outburst are studied with INTEGRAL and RXTE. Four cyclotron absorption lines are detected using the spectra from combined data of IBIS and JEM-X aboard INTEGRAL in the energy range of 3 [...] 100 keV.
