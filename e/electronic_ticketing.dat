5|$|Along {{with the}} {{establishment}} of the light rail service, the public transport in Bergen underwent other changes. Skyss was established in 2007 to administer the public transport system, manage routes and market public transport, which would be operated by private companies based on public service obligations. At the same time, a new <b>electronic</b> <b>ticketing</b> system was introduced.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{opens to}} ticket holders {{two hours before}} kick-off. The main club shop, named 'The Armoury', and ticket offices are located near the West Stand, with other an {{additional}} store {{at the base of}} the North Bank Bridge, named 'All Arsenal' and the 'Arsenal Store' next to Finsbury Park station. Arsenal operates an <b>electronic</b> <b>ticketing</b> system where members of 'The Arsenal' (the club's fan membership scheme) use their membership cards to enter the stadium, thus removing the need for turnstile operators. Non-members are issued with one-off paper tickets embedded with an RFID tag allowing them to enter the stadium.|$|E

The system would originally be for MTA employees only. On October 23, 2017, {{it was announced that}} the MetroCard would be phased out and replaced by a contactless fare payment system also by Cubic, with fare payment being made using Apple Pay, Google Wallet, debit/credit cards with near-field communication enabled, or radio-frequency identification cards. The October 23 announcement calls for the expansion of this system to a general-use electronic fare payment system at 500 subway turnstiles and 600 buses by late 2018, with all buses and subway stations using electronic fare collection by 2020. However, support of the MetroCard is slated to remain until 2023. The unnamed replacement fare system has been criticized because the new turnstiles could be hacked, thereby leaving credit card and phone information vulnerable to theft.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{lies within}} the field of Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction with a {{particular}} focus on user acceptance of tickets in relation with football games. The goal of this thesis is to study user acceptance of paper and <b>electronic</b> <b>tickets</b> and to study the <b>electronic</b> <b>ticket</b> in relation with the Innovation of Diffusion theory (IDT) by Rogers (Rogers, 2003) and Ubiquitous computing and related theories. The technology emphasized is the wireless technology RFID and especially contactless smart cards which are used as the <b>electronic</b> <b>ticket.</b> A case study is conducted on the Smart Stadium system which is used at different football stadiums in Norway. Kristiansand stadium is one of these and it is reviewed closely. One of the benefits with the Smart Stadium system is the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>tickets.</b> A user survey is conducted among 156 users of the system as well and this shows that the paper ticket has higher user acceptance than the <b>electronic</b> <b>ticket.</b> Tradition and the feeling of security when holding the paper ticket physically in the hand are the mains reasons for this choice. The categorization of the respondents from the survey into adopter categories shows slight differences from the original model developed by Rogers. In addition can concepts from Ubiquitous computing and related theories like Calm computing, Tangible computing, Ambient Intelligence and Unremarkable computing make the attribute of complexity, which is one of Rogers five perceived attributes of accepting technology, better described and understood...|$|R

From Ballarat station, V/Line operates VLocity trains running at up to [...] east to Melbourne, west to Ararat and north to Maryborough. Since the controversial removal of [...] "flagship" [...] express services in 2011, successive timetable changes have slowed peak hour services to Southern Cross Station, with the current journey taking a minimum of 73 minutes. Patronage however has continued to grow. The Regional Rail Link project is aimed at separating Ballarat trains from Melbourne's suburban rail network. Interurban services (Ballarat-Melbourne) now run half-hourly during weekday peak and hourly during weekday non-peak and on weekends from Ballarat station.

40|$|Project Specification: This project should {{build on}} the {{existing}} participant registration module of Indico and provide additional functionalities for managing the check-in process. While in small conferences {{it is easy to}} keep track of participants with a simple paper list, such techniques become inefficient when the need to scale the process up arises. Therefore Indico’s participant registration module would be extended with the functionality to generate <b>electronic</b> <b>tickets.</b> This will allow conference organizers to keep track of attendees after they finish the registration process. As part of this project it is also necessary to develop a mobile application that will be used to scan the <b>electronic</b> <b>tickets,</b> identify the user and mark them as checked in when they arrive at the conference. Additionally Indico’s HTTP API would be extended to be used by the mobile application to retrieve data about conferences and attendees. Abstract: The main goal of this project is to simplify the check-in process for conferences that use the Indico conference management system. This is archived by extending Indico’s core to include <b>electronic</b> <b>ticket</b> generation functionality and developing a mobile application that is used to scan the <b>electronic</b> <b>tickets</b> during the check-in process.
