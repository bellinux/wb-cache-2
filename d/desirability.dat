5|$|For Steiner, all of offers, {{threats and}} throffers affect the {{practical}} deliberations of their recipient {{in the same}} way. What is significant for {{the subject of the}} intervention is not {{the extent to which the}} consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in <b>desirability</b> from the norm, but the extent to which they differ in <b>desirability</b> from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in <b>desirability</b> between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} past {{proposals}} {{to connect the}} Croydon Tramlink to Crystal Palace, with mayoral candidates citing the <b>desirability</b> of the initiative.|$|E
5|$|Courtier and {{journalist}} Dermot Morrah alleged {{that there was}} brief speculation as to the <b>desirability</b> of bypassing Albert (and his children) and his brother, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, in favour of their younger brother Prince George, Duke of Kent. This {{seems to have been}} suggested on the grounds that Prince George was at that time the only brother with a son.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian Ebers Papyrus from 1550BCE and the Kahun Papyrus from 1850BCE have {{within them}} {{some of the}} {{earliest}} documented descriptions of birth control: the use of honey, acacia leaves and lint to be placed in the vagina to block sperm. It is believed that in Ancient Greece silphium was used as birth control which, due to its effectiveness and thus <b>desirability,</b> was harvested into extinction.|$|E
5|$|The {{audience}} is seated {{in front of}} the stage, to {{the left side of the}} stage, and in the corner front-left of stage; these are in order of decreasing <b>desirability.</b> While the metsuke-bashira pillar obstructs the view of the stage, the actors are primarily at the corners, not the center, and thus the two aisles are located where the views of the two main actors would be obscured, ensuring a generally clear view regardless of seating.|$|E
5|$|The {{event has}} also been commemorated through {{references}} in television, theatre, and popular music. A play about the shootings by Adam Kelly called The Anorak was named {{as one of the}} best plays of 2004 by the Montreal Gazette. A movie entitled Polytechnique, directed by Denis Villeneuve was released in 2009, and sparked controversy over the <b>desirability</b> of reliving the tragedy in a commercial film.|$|E
5|$|The square {{was once}} famous for feral pigeons and feeding {{them was a}} popular activity. Pigeons began {{flocking}} to the square before construction was completed and feed sellers became {{well known in the}} Victorian era. The <b>desirability</b> of the birds' presence was contentious: their droppings disfigured the stonework and the flock, estimated at its peak to be 35,000, was considered a health hazard. A stall seller, Bernie Rayner, infamously sold bird seed to tourists at inflated prices.|$|E
5|$|Within {{much of its}} range, {{the painted}} turtle is the most {{abundant}} turtle species. Population densities range from 10 to 840turtles per hectare (2.5 acres) of water surface. Warmer climates produce higher relative densities among populations, and habitat <b>desirability</b> also influences density. Rivers and large lakes have lower densities because only the shore is desirable habitat; the central, deep waters skew the surface-based estimates. Also, lake and river turtles have to make longer linear trips to access equivalent amounts of foraging space.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} abroad, Cú Chulainn had rescued Derbforgaill, a Scandinavian princess, from being sacrificed to the Fomorians. She {{falls in love}} with him, and she and her handmaid come to Ireland in search of him {{in the form of a}} pair of swans. Cú Chulainn, not {{realising}} who she is, shoots her down with his sling, and then saves her life by sucking the stone from her side. Having tasted her blood, he cannot marry her, and gives her to his foster-son Lugaid Riab nDerg. Lugaid goes on to become High King of Ireland, but the Lia Fáil (stone of destiny), fails to cry out when he stands on it, so Cú Chulainn splits it in two with his sword. When Derbforgaill is mutilated by the women of Ulster out of jealousy for her sexual <b>desirability</b> and dies of her wounds, Lugaid dies of grief, and Cú Chulainn avenges them by demolishing the house the women are inside, killing 150 of them.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th {{century the}} ideals of the Western European Enlightenment and the French Revolution became widely known to the Greek scholars. They soon {{realized}} the potential of these new ideals, and especially of popular freedom and sovereignty for their own national struggle against Ottoman rule. Adamantios Korais, a humanist scholar and leading figure of the modern Greek Enlightenment, had stressed the <b>desirability</b> of a printed medium, written in the vernacular language, in order to spread these ideas to the Greek people, that lived in the Ottoman Empire and the Diaspora in Western Europe as well. Korais explained about the necessity of a periodical that would gather material from political and philological newspapers of the enlightened peoples of Europe and contain reports from Ottoman-ruled Greece. He also stressed that this should be edited by a man of learning, and proposed that his friend Anthimos Gazis, scholar and Orthodox priest in Vienna, would be the most suitable person.|$|E
5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of <b>desirability.</b> While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E
5|$|The Ikarus IK-2 was a 1930s high-wing, single-seat, {{monoplane}} fighter aircraft of Yugoslav design {{built for}} the Royal Yugoslav Air Force. The IK-2 was designed by French-trained engineers Kosta Sivčev and Ljubomir Ilić, who saw the <b>desirability</b> of a developing a home-grown aircraft industry. A gull-wing design, it was armed with a hub-firing autocannon and fuselage-mounted synchronised machine guns. Just 12 production models were built, as the aircraft was obsolescent {{at the time it}} was brought into service in 1935, and only eight were serviceable at the time of the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. After the defeat of Yugoslavia, the remaining four aircraft were taken onto the strength of the air force of the Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, but none survived the war.|$|E
5|$|The Joker is {{considered}} one of, if not, the most-recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture (Batman's arguable equal), {{one of the best}} comic villains, and one of the greatest villains of all-time. The character was well-liked following his debut, appearing in nine out of the first twelve Batman issues, and remained one of Batman's most popular foes throughout his publication. The character {{is considered}} one of the four top comic book characters, alongside Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man. Indeed, when DC Comics released the original series of Greatest Stories Ever Told (1987–1988) featuring collections of stories about heroes like Batman and Superman, the Joker was the only villain included alongside them. The character has been the focus of ethical discussion on the <b>desirability</b> of Batman (who adheres to an unbreakable code forbidding killing) saving lives by murdering the Joker (a relentless dealer of death). These debates weigh the positive (stopping the Joker permanently) against its effect on Batman's character and the possibility that he might begin killing all criminals.|$|E
5|$|The process {{required}} {{a range of}} equipment. Some of this was protective equipment to allow the workforce and horses to operate safely on ice, including cork shoes {{for the men and}} spiked horse shoes. Early in the 19th century only ad hoc, improvised tools such as pickaxes and chisels were used {{for the rest of the}} harvest, but in the 1840s Wyeth introduced various new designs to allow for a larger scale, more commercial harvesting process. These included a horse-drawn ice cutter, resembling a plough with two parallel cutters to help in marking out the ice quickly and uniformly, and later a horse-drawn plough with teeth to assist in the cutting process itself, replacing the hand saw. By the 1850s, specialist ice tool manufacturers were producing catalogues and selling products along the east coast. There were discussions over the <b>desirability</b> of a circular cutting saw for much of the 19th century, but it proved impractical to power them with horses and they were not introduced to ice harvesting until the start of the 20th century, when gasoline engines became available.|$|E
5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the <b>desirability</b> of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are {{valuable}} on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the ascent}} of the Bourbon monarchy in Spain in 1700, {{each of the}} regions of Spain {{retained}} its own system of measurement. The new Bourbon monarchy tried to centralise control {{and with it the}} system of measurement. There were debates regarding the <b>desirability</b> of retaining the Castilian units of measure or, in the interests of harmonisation, adopting the French system. Although Spain assisted Méchain in his meridian survey, the Government feared the French revolutionary movement and reinforced the Castilian units of measure to counter such movements. By 1849 however, it proved difficult to maintain the old system and in that year the metric system became the legal system of measure in Spain.The Government was urged by the Spanish Royal Academy of Science to approve the creation of a large-scale map of Spain in 1852. The following year Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero was appointed to undertake this task. All the scientific and technical material had to be created. Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero and Saavedra went to Paris to supervise the production by Brunner of a measuring instrument which they had devised and which they later compared with Borda's double-toise N°1 which was the main reference for measuring all geodetic bases in France and whose length was 3.8980732 metres.|$|E
5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year public consultation process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy. One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the <b>desirability</b> and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E

25|$|The CPSS scale assesses {{avoidance}} {{and change}} of activities, {{which may not}} accurately reflect pathology. This could possibly result in higher PTSD prevalence estimations. In a study, the CPSS scale correctly classified 72.2% of children. Nearly one-quarter of children were misclassified and 5.6% were misclassified (false negative). CPSS is a self-reporting assessment and is, therefore, subject to social <b>desirability</b> bias. Social <b>desirability</b> bias influences respondents to answer questions {{in a way that}} presents them more favorably to others. This interferes with the purpose of the assessment and prevents clinicians from properly screening for PTSD.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Hemmings Classic Car {{included}} the two-seat AMXs in {{their list of}} 32 best cars to restore {{in terms of economic}} sense after factoring purchase price, parts availability, as well as restored value and <b>desirability.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} the 1845 Bill {{submission}} was that the preamble was proved but that the Committee stage in the House of Lords rejected the Bill: {{this meant that the}} <b>desirability</b> of the line was accepted, but that the detail of Moorsom's design was considered unsafe.|$|E
25|$|This {{scale is}} made up of 90 items {{analysing}} 9 aspects relating couple's intimacy: sexuality, love, expressiveness, marital cohesion, couple compatibility, partners' independence, conflicts, social identity and <b>desirability</b> bias. This scale seems to be reliable and free from sexual preconceptions although plethoric in conceptualising some of the items.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, the U.N. General Assembly adopted resolutions {{endorsing}} the <b>desirability</b> of replacing the Armistice Agreement with {{a peace treaty}} and dissolving the UNC. This was followed by North Korean attempts to start peace discussions with the U.S. The U.S. however believed influencing China to restrict North Korean actions would be more effective.|$|E
25|$|The <b>desirability</b> {{of custom}} {{templates}} for non-compact group is {{in conflict with}} the principle of learning invariant representations. However, for certain kinds of regularly encountered image transformations, templates might be the result of evolutionary adaptations. Neurobiological data suggests that there is Gabor-like tuning in the first layer of visual cortex. The optimality of Gabor templates for translations and scales is a possible explanation of this phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} theory proposed by Darwin states {{that only the}} fittest will survive and by lying, we aim to improve other's perception of our social image and status, capability, and <b>desirability</b> in general. Studies have shown that humans begin lying at a mere age of 6 months, through crying and laughing, to gain attention. Scientific studies have also shown the presence of gender differences in lying.|$|E
25|$|In {{the study}} Post-decision Changes in <b>Desirability</b> of Alternatives (1956) 225 women {{students}} rated {{a series of}} domestic appliances, and then were asked to choose one of two appliances as a gift.

25|$|John Ruskin, (1819–1900), an art critic, wrote {{two books}} that were highly {{influential}} in Art Philosophy. In The Seven Lamps of Architecture (1849) and The Stones of Venice (1851–1853), he discussed the moral, social and religious implications of buildings, emphasising the <b>desirability</b> of an ethical {{approach to the}} practice of the arts. His thinking influenced the Pre-Raphaelites, whose artistic style Ruskin defended against criticism.|$|E
25|$|Following the Parliament's waiver, the Attorney General {{applied to}} lift the stay imposed by Judge Aikens. The {{application}} was heard by Judge Gross on 17 October 2006 who granted the application, ruling that the <b>desirability</b> of proceeding with the trial outweighed any potential injustice to Mote that might result if the CFI were to annul {{the decision of the}} European Parliament to grant a waiver.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of Tantric Buddhism in Western Xia {{led to the}} spread of some sexually related customs. Before Uighur women in Shanxi in the 12th century could get married to men of their own ethnicity when they reached 30 years old, they would have sex and bear children with multiple Han Chinese men and their <b>desirability</b> as a wife corresponded to whether she had been with a large number of men.|$|E
