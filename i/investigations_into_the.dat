Another project was carried out in 1994 and 1995, uncovering part of the original garden of the tower and the 16th century adjoining timber house, and an architectural survey between 2009 and 2011 determined that one of the wooden doors on the second floor was probably an original feature from 1365.|$|E

5|$|The {{disappearance}} of De Mauro remained a mystery and {{a matter for}} many speculations.

According to Buscetta, Mattei was killed {{at the request of the}} American Cosa Nostra because his oil policies had damaged important American interests in the Middle East. The American Mafia in turn was possibly doing a favour to the large oil companies.|$|E

5|$|Buscetta {{claimed that}} Mafia boss Stefano Bontade {{organized}} De Mauro’s kidnap, because his <b>investigations</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> death of Mattei {{came very close}} to the Mafia, and Bontade’s own role in the affair.

Yet another pentito, Rosario Naimo, who started to collaborate with the Italian authorities after his arrest in October 2010, said that the journalist was killed because of his investigative reporting that damaged the Mafia.|$|E
