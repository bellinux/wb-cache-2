The white coats, as the French called the Austrians, were far better soldiers than the French assumed, and despite such demonstrations as that at Ostrach, Stockach and Winterthur, the French {{continued to hold}} this prejudice. This did not change until 1809 when the Battle of Aspern-Essling and the Battle of Wagram {{a few weeks later}} caused Napoleon to revise <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> the Austrian military.|$|E

5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> Bonds. He {{clarified}} {{that he was}} a fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk for Bonds's alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E
