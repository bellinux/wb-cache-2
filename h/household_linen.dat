5|$|Indians {{are known}} to use resist method of {{printing}} designs on cotton fabrics, which {{can be traced back}} 2000 years. Initially, wax and even rice starch were used for printing on fabrics. Until recently batik was made only for dresses and tailored garments, but modern batik is applied in numerous items, such as murals, wall hangings, paintings, <b>household</b> <b>linen,</b> and scarves, with livelier and brighter patterns. Contemporary batik making in India is also done by the Deaf women of Delhi, these women are fluent in Indian Sign Language and also work in other vocational programs.|$|E

50|$|Cleaning <b>household</b> <b>linens</b> is done as {{appropriate}} {{to the type of}} cloth. <b>Household</b> <b>linens</b> are most likely to have stains from organic sources such as food, blood, and soil. If the linens are made of natural fibres such as linen or cotton, the cloth will need to be rinsed as soon as possible in cold water to prevent the stain from becoming permanent. Stains from red wine, or red or purple berries and fruit are an exception and must be washed in boiling water, yet despite this, these stains may be impossible to remove. Otherwise, regular washing of <b>household</b> <b>linens</b> should be done in hot water for hygienic reasons, to destroy bacteria left on the linens from frequent use. Linen and cotton that are white may also become yellow over time, but this is eliminated by bleaching, either with liquid bleach, or by the traditional method of hanging the linens in the sun to let the sunlight bleach out the discoloration.|$|R
5000|$|Hemstitch or hem-stitch is a {{decorative}} drawn thread work or openwork hand-sewing technique for embellishing {{the hem of}} clothing or <b>household</b> <b>linens.</b> Unlike an ordinary hem, hemstitching can employ embroidery thread in a contrasting color {{so as to be}} noticeable.|$|R

60|$|It was, he felt, {{a ridiculous}} {{position}} for a Hidalgo of Spain. But his dignity was to suffer still greater damage. In another moment she had bundled him into an alcove behind the arras at the chamber's end, a tiny closet that was no better than a cupboard contrived for the storing of <b>household</b> <b>linen.</b> She had-moved with a swift precision which at another time might have provoked his admiration, snatching up his cloak and hat, and other evidences of his presence, quenching the lamp, and dragging him to that place of cramped concealment, which she remained to share with him.|$|E
50|$|The {{most basic}} kind of drawn thread work is hemstitching. Drawn thread work {{is often used}} to {{decorate}} the trimmings of clothes or <b>household</b> <b>linens.</b> The border between hemstitching gone fancy and more elaborate styles of drawn thread work isn't always clear.|$|R
50|$|Microbiological and {{epidemiological}} data indicates that clothing and <b>household</b> <b>linens</b> etc. are {{a risk factor}} for infection transmission in home and everyday life settings as well as institutional settings, although the lack of quantitative data directly linking contaminated clothing to infection in the domestic setting makes it difficult to assess the extent of the risk. Although microbiological data indicates that risks from clothing and <b>household</b> <b>linens</b> are somewhat less than those associated with hands, hand contact and food contact surfaces, and cleaning cloths, nevertheless these risks needs to be appropriately managed through effective laundering practices. In the home, this routine should be carried out as part of a multibarrier approach to hygiene which also includes hand, food, respiratory and other hygiene practices.|$|R

First came a ball dress of pale-yellow satin brocade, made with the trained skirt, [...] "baby" [...] waist and full puffed sleeves of a former generation.

60|$|I {{think one}} {{would learn to}} love these German women if one lived among them for long. There is {{something}} so sweet, so womanly, so genuine about them. They seem to shed around them, from their bright, good-tempered faces, a healthy atmosphere {{of all that is}} homely, and simple, and good. Looking into their quiet, steadfast eyes, one dreams of white <b>household</b> <b>linen,</b> folded in great presses; of sweet-smelling herbs; of savoury, appetising things being cooked for supper; of bright-polished furniture; of the patter of tiny feet; of little high-pitched voices, asking silly questions; of quiet talks in the lamp-lit parlour after the children are in bed, upon important questions of house management and home politics, while long stockings are being darned.|$|E
60|$|Violet was, {{during her}} husband's absence, {{to be left}} at Rickworth; {{and in the last}} week she had several other presents, a splendid dressing-case from Lady Martindale, {{containing}} more implements than she knew how to use, also the print of Lalla Rookh; and even little Miss Piper had spent much time and trouble on a very ugly cushion. Theodora declared her present should be useful, and gave all the <b>household</b> <b>linen,</b> for the purpose of having it hemmed by her school-children;--and this, though she and Miss Piper sat up for three nights till one o'clock to hasten it, was so far from ready, that Captain and Mrs. Martindale would have begun the world without one table-cloth, if old Aunt Moss had not been hemming for them ever since the day of Arthur's proposal.|$|E

50|$|Cross stitch {{was widely}} used to mark <b>household</b> <b>linens</b> in the 18th and 19th centuries, and girls' skills in this {{essential}} task were demonstrated with elaborate samplers embroidered with cross-stitched alphabets, numbers, birds and other animals, and the crowns and coronets sewn onto the linens of the nobility. Much of contemporary cross-stitch embroidery derives from this tradition.|$|R
60|$|Mr. John Dashwood {{told his}} mother again and again how {{exceedingly}} sorry he {{was that she had}} taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture. He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of <b>household</b> <b>linen,</b> plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's. Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any handsome article of furniture.|$|E

I have been studying hard with Mrs. Parker at the hotel, who seems to be an excellent housekeeper and accustomed to homely fare, and I have learned how to make and to cook a great many things which are simple and nutritious; I have had appropriate dresses made, and Maria has gone to town and bought me a great variety of <b>household</b> <b>linen,</b> all good and plain, for our damask table-cloths would look perfectly ridiculous here.

60|$|They {{crossed a}} broad but scantily-furnished hall. Everywhere {{the same look}} of hopeless incompleteness, {{temporary}} utility, and premature decay; most of the furniture was mismatched and misplaced; many of the rooms had changed their original functions or doubled them; a smell of cooking came from the library, on whose shelves, mingled with books, were dresses and <b>household</b> <b>linen,</b> and {{through the door of}} a room into which Mrs. Delatour retired to remove her duster Mr. Bowers caught a glimpse of a bed, and of a table covered with books and papers, at which a tall, fair girl was writing. In a few moments Mrs. Delatour returned, accompanied by this girl, and Eunice, her short-lipped sister. Bob, who joined the party seated around Mr. Bowers and a table set with cake, a decanter, and glasses, completed the group. Emboldened by the presence of the tall Cynthia and his glimpse of her previous literary attitude, Mr. Bowers resolved to make one more attempt.|$|E
50|$|In {{the period}} between 1650-1850 Hardangersom (meaning: work from Hardanger area) flourished in Norway.

6000|$|After that Uncle William {{decided that}} it was {{necessary}} for me to marry in a way to restore our fortunes and he decided to offer me to a State Governor. He asked me if I had any choice of States, and I said no. Of course I should not have wished to marry a state governor, but I knew my duty towards Uncle William and I said nothing. So Uncle got a map of the United States and he decided to marry me to the Governor of Texas. He told me that I could have two weeks to arrange my supply of <b>household</b> <b>linen</b> and my trousseau to take to Texas, and he wrote at once to the Governor. He showed me what he wrote {{and it was a very}} formal letter. I think that Uncle's mind gets more and more confused as to where he is and what he is and he wrote in quite the old strain and I noticed that he signed himself, [...] "Your brother, William." [...] Perhaps it was on that account that we had no answer to the letter. Uncle seemed to forget all about it very soon and I was glad that it was so, and that I had escaped going to the court of Texas.|$|E
60|$|But {{when she}} had {{collected}} herself together after the crash, and had made up her mind, as had Dosett also, {{to the nature of}} the life which they must in future lead, she became more stringent in it even than he. He could bear and say nothing; but she, in bearing, found herself compelled to say much. It had been her fault,--the fault of people on her side,--and she would fain have fed her husband with the full flowery potato while she ate only the rind. She told him, unnecessarily, over and over again, that she had ruined him by her marriage. No such idea was ever in his head. The thing had come, and so it must be. There was food to eat, potatoes enough for both, and a genteel house in which to live. He could still be happy if she would not groan. A certain amount of groaning she did postpone while in his presence. The sewing of seams, and the darning of <b>household</b> <b>linen,</b> which in his eyes amounted to groaning, was done in his absence. After their genteel dinner he would sleep a little, and she would knit. He would have his glass of wine, but would make his bottle of port last almost for a week. This was the house to which Lucy Dormer was brought when Mr. Dosett had consented to share with Sir Thomas the burden left by the death of the improvident artist.|$|E
60|$|Any {{tolerable}} western divorce law {{must put}} the sentimental grievances first, and should carefully avoid singling out any ground of divorce {{in such a}} way as to create a convention that persons having that ground are bound in honor to avail themselves of it. It is generally admitted that people should not be encouraged to petition for a divorce in a fit of petulance. What is not so clearly seen is that neither should they be encouraged to petition in a fit of jealousy, which is certainly the most detestable and mischievous of all the passions that enjoy public credit. Still less should people who are not jealous be urged to behave as if they were jealous, and to enter upon duels and divorce suits in which they have no desire to be successful. There should be no publication of the grounds on which a divorce is sought or granted; and as this would abolish the only means the public now has of ascertaining that every possible effort has been made to keep the couple united against their wills, such privacy will only be tolerated when we at last admit that the sole and sufficient reason why people should be granted a divorce is that they want one. Then there will be no more reports of divorce cases, no more letters read in court with an indelicacy that makes every sensitive person shudder and recoil as from a profanation, no more washing of <b>household</b> <b>linen,</b> dirty or clean, in public. We must learn in these matters to mind our own business and not impose our individual notions of propriety on one another, even if it carries us to the length of openly admitting what we are now compelled to assume silently, that every human being has a right to sexual experience, and that the law is concerned only with parentage, which is now a separate matter.|$|E
50|$|The Industrial Revolution brought huge {{changes to}} cloth manufacturing. The rise of European {{colonialism}} {{at the same}} time helped support the rapid growth of cloth production by creating many cheap sources of raw materials. British cloth manufacturers would import raw cotton from America and the British West Indies to Ireland, where it would be spun into yarn. The yarn would be imported into England, where mechanized factories employed thousands of workers, who would weave cloth on industrial looms. In 1781, a cloth producer from Manchester testified about his business to a committee of the House of Commons in the British Parliament. He stated that he employed 6000 workers, who would print and stamp 60,000 yards of cotton and linen fabric a year. Cotton gradually replaced linen for most uses in clothing, but remained preferred for bedsheets and tablecloths. Other European countries manufactured and traded their own types of <b>household</b> <b>linens</b> as well, and mass manufacturing techniques and trade competition gradually made affordable <b>household</b> <b>linens</b> common.|$|R
50|$|The {{collecting}} and restoring of antique linens can be complex, {{depending upon the}} condition of the cloth. Many old <b>household</b> <b>linens</b> were stored filled with starch, which damages the cloth over time since it hardens and causes wearing and tears in the fabric where it is folded and creased. The owner of an antique linen must determine if conserving, repairing, or mending are appropriate.|$|R
