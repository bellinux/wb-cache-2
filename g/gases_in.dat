5|$|Dalton also {{believed}} atomic theory {{could explain why}} water absorbs different <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen.

5|$|The {{absorption}} of <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> liquids {{depends on the}} solubility of the specific gas in the specific liquid, the concentration of gas, customarily expressed as partial pressure, and temperature. The main variable {{in the study of}} decompression theory is pressure.|$|E
30|$|A {{comparison}} of diffusion coefficients of natural <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> foamy oil, saturated oil, and dead oil {{at the same}} pressure indicates that diffusion coefficients of natural <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> foamy oil are lower than that of <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> saturated oil and dead oil. For example, the diffusion coefficients of natural <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> dead oil are 3.02 and 4.02 times than that of <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> saturated oil and foamy oil when the pressure is 20  MPa. This is the reason why the cumulative diffusion volume of <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> dead oil is larger than that of <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> saturated oil and foamy oil.|$|R

5|$|The {{cause of}} {{narcosis}} {{is related to}} the increased solubility of <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> body tissues, {{as a result of the}} elevated pressures at depth (Henry's law). Modern theories have suggested that inert gases dissolving in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes cause narcosis. More recently, researchers have been looking at neurotransmitter receptor protein mechanisms as a possible cause of narcosis. The breathing gas mix entering the diver's lungs will have the same pressure as the surrounding water, known as the ambient pressure. After any change of depth, the pressure of <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> the blood passing through the brain catches up with ambient pressure within a minute or two, which results in a delayed narcotic effect after descending to a new depth. Rapid compression potentiates narcosis owing to carbon dioxide retention.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> any given tissue {{depend on the}} history of pressure and gas composition. Under equilibrium conditions, the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the ambient pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction in ambient pressure, the rate of pressure reduction may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues. When the pressure of <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> a bubble exceed the combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface, the bubbles grow, and this growth can damage tissue.|$|E

5|$|The most talked-about {{applications}} {{of these models}} {{in recent years have}} been their use to infer the consequences of increasing greenhouse <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide (see greenhouse gas).

5|$|If a star {{displays}} magnetic {{surface activity}} such as starspots, then these features can be tracked {{to estimate the}} rotation rate. However, such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes {{over the course of}} their life span, so differential rotation of a star can produce varying measurements. Stellar magnetic activity is often associated with rapid rotation, so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars. Observation of starspots has shown that these features can actually vary the rotation rate of a star, as the magnetic fields modify the flow of <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> the star.|$|E

5|$|Welders {{are also}} often exposed to {{dangerous}} gases and particulate matter.

5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.
