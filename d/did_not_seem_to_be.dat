5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E
5|$|Artillery, supplies, {{and troops}} were all being {{evacuated}} {{across the river}} at this time {{but it was not}} going as fast as Washington had anticipated and daybreak soon came. A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan. All 9,000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life.|$|E
5|$|In {{qualifying}} Hamilton {{took his}} first pole position {{as part of a}} McLaren one-two. Heidfeld improved on his practice performance to take third position, in front of the Ferraris of Räikkönen and Massa. Massa shared the third row with Mark Webber, who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> suffering the same braking problem that almost put teammate David Coulthard out in the first session of qualifying, he had only one attempt at a lap in the second session as a result. Nico Rosberg, Robert Kubica, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli completed the top ten.|$|E

25|$|Captain Nolan's {{estimated}} monthly {{basic pay}} of $175.00 (or $210.00 depending on calculation of service time) was stopped in September 1869 and every penny {{was attached to}} pay the $5,217.33 due. At that monthly rate it would take almost 30 (or 24) months of his pay to settle the debt. His allowances as befitting his rank <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attached.|$|E
25|$|However, he {{reduced the}} {{sentence}} from 14 years to 11 years noting that Baker <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the mastermind, {{and his family}} had been worried about him. Baker's fine was also reduced from ¥5,000,000 (approximately £24,392) to ¥3,000,000 (approximately £14,635). This had to be paid within four weeks or he would have to serve an extra 150 days of hard labour.|$|E
25|$|Dementieva had no {{particular}} favorite surface, as her playing ability {{allowed her to}} adapt easily on each surface although her best results were on hard courts, while her two Grand Slam finals were on hard court and clay. While her heavy groundstroking baseline game <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that suited to grass, her athleticism and improved serve, in particular her slice serve, led to two consecutive semi-final appearances at Wimbledon.|$|E

25|$|Rather {{than the}} formal definition, {{it is more}} {{understandable}} with some historical context. The British generally seemed to be most consistent between theory and practice, although the minimum-effort theory, which worked in Malaya, {{did not seem to}} apply to Northern Ireland. French doctrine {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, involving working with locals, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the heart of doctrine in Algeria and Indochina. France does seem to manage cooperation with former colonies, now clients.|$|E
25|$|Dawson et al. also {{surveyed}} the golden jellyfish populations in three other Palauan marine lakes. They found {{significant changes in}} the medusa population in two of these lakes, Clear Lake on Eil Malk and Goby Lake on Koror. The golden jellyfish population in Big Jellyfish Lake, Koror <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affected. The reason for this was not clear, but Big Jellyfish Lake experienced lower temperature increases than the other lakes and there was experimental evidence that the golden jellyfish medusa from Big Jellyfish Lake were more tolerant of higher temperatures.|$|E
25|$|On 20 April 1956, Maria married Johan Gerardus Wolkefeld, a 21-year-old Dutch Catholic. On 15 February 1957, {{she gave}} birth to a son, the first of ten children. However, Maria <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> contented. As she told De Telegraaf, she often had rows with her mother, who lived nearby. She also said she still longed for her Malayan homeland. Johan and Mansoor began corresponding. In letters both {{expressed}} wish for Maria to travel to Malaya to visit the aged Aminah, but such trip was never made due primarily to financial difficulties. Aminah died in 1976 and Mansoor would die {{of a heart attack in}} 1988.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the tachi would be paired with a tantō and later the uchigatana would be paired with another shorter uchigatana. With {{the advent of the}} katana, the wakizashi {{eventually}} was chosen by samurai as the short sword over the tantō. Kanzan Satō in his book The Japanese sword notes that there <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> any particular need for the wakizashi and suggests that the wakizashi may have become more popular than the tantō due to the wakizashi being more suited for indoor fighting. He mentions the custom of leaving the katana at the door of a castle or palace when entering while continuing to wear the wakizashi inside.|$|E
25|$|Many fans {{disliked the}} {{progressive}} direction, expecting a reprise of Borrowed Time. During {{the recording of}} the album a split in the band occurred with Scott being fired and Kimberley quiting once all his bass parts had been recorded. Tatler explained that Kimberly found the band too much hard work and Scott <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> improving quickly enough. Mervyn Goldsworthy, formerly of Samson, and Robbie France, later {{a founding member of}} Skunk Anansie, came in on bass and drums respectively. Also introduced to the band was keyboard player Josh Phillips-Gorse. Live footage of this line up's live show at the University of Leicester on 12 February 1984 was officially released on VHS via the Diamond Head fan club.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Cheatham's {{division}} under Maj. Gen. John C. Brown (Cheatham's own division {{before he}} assumed corps command) had crossed Rutherford Creek and was moved into position by Cheatham for another attack on Spring Hill, on Cleburne's right. In the gathering darkness, {{the sounds of}} Brown's guns would be the signal for Cleburne's men to resume their attack. Brown did not attack, however. His brigade commander on the right, Brig. Gen. Otho F. Strahl, reported that there were Union troops in position on his right flank and front and that Forrest's cavalrymen, promised to protect his right flank, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present. Since his brigade under Brig. Gen. States Rights Gist had not yet arrived to join the attack, Brown decided to consult with his corps commander before proceeding.|$|E

25|$|The Department of Canadian Heritage gave Telefilm Canada more {{funds in}} 2001 {{to help develop}} the Canadian film industry, {{with the goal of}} having Canadian feature films obtain five per cent of the {{domestic}} box office by 2005. Telefilm divided this between English films then capturing four per cent of the market and French films at 12 per cent. At first, the new initiative <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> making much progress: at the end of 2003, English films represented only one per cent of the domestic box office, while French films made up 20 per cent. The overall goal of the Canada Feature Film Fund now is to have Canadian feature films capture five per cent of the domestic box office by 2006, one year behind schedule. It is now 2014 and they have not met their goal.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} the {{computing}} model changed, and Unix's treatment of everything as a file or byte stream no longer was as universally applicable as it was before. Although a terminal could {{be treated as a}} file or a byte stream, which is printed to or read from, the same <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true for a graphical user interface. Networking posed another problem. Even if network communication can be compared to file access, the low-level packet-oriented architecture dealt with discrete chunks of data and not with whole files. As the capability of computers grew, Unix became increasingly cluttered with code. It is also because the modularity of the Unix kernel is extensively scalable. While kernels might have had 100,000 lines of code in the seventies and eighties, kernels of modern Unix successors like Linux have more than 13 million lines.|$|E
25|$|Wattles began {{training}} Dan Patch {{in earnest}} at a half-mile track (0.8 km) in Templeton in 1899. Before {{his first start}} in August 1900, Dan Patch impressed Messner and Wattles with a timed mile of 2:14, a promising performance for an unprompted horse who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> working hard. On August 30, they entered him at the Boswell county fair with a purse of $250 against 2:35 horses, meaning their fastest official time was {{no better than the}} next level of 2:20. Attendance at the fair that day exceeded 8,000, boosted by a large contingent from Oxford who wanted to see the local favorite. Dan Patch did not disappoint, winning in three straight heats in times of 2:24, 2:24 and 2:24. Wattles had not pushed the colt, wanting to be able to stay at the 2:35 level and perhaps to improve his odds in potential side bets in his upcoming races.|$|E
