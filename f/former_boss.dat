5|$|In 1982, the Talbot Group was {{merged into}} Peugeot within PSA, and {{responsibility}} for the model was devolved to France. The Whitley design studio was dissolved, {{and some of the}} designers crossed over to British Leyland, where they joined their <b>former</b> <b>boss</b> Roy Axe. PSA had by then already started work on a replacement for the Samba, based on the Citroën AX, a few prototypes of which—essentially rebadged AXs—were created in 1983/84. The Samba sold reasonably well throughout 1982 and 1983, after which sales began to suffer, partly because of the model's aging and partly because of competition from the very popular Peugeot 205, which created powerful (and successful) internal competition within PSA for the little Talbot.|$|E
5|$|Set in 1964 (three {{decades before}} {{the events of}} the {{original}} Metal Gear), the story centers on FOX operative codenamed Naked Snake as he attempts to rescue a Russian rocket scientist by the name of Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov, sabotage an experimental superweapon, and assassinate his defected <b>former</b> <b>boss.</b> While previous games were set in a primarily urban environment, Snake Eater adopts a 1960s Soviet jungle setting, with the high tech, near-future trappings of previous Metal Gear Solid games being replaced with the wilderness. While the setting has changed, the game's focus remains on stealth and infiltration, while retaining the series' self-referential, fourth wall-breaking sense of humor. The story of Snake Eater is told through numerous cut scenes and radio conversations.|$|E

5|$|The {{restaurant}} was {{moved into the}} Berkeley Hotel in 2003 where it replaced Pierre Koffmann's La Tante Claire, {{in the same year}} that Wareing became Chef Patron of the Grill Room at the Savoy Hotel, and he was named Chef of the Year by Caterer and Hotelkeepers Catey Awards. The return to the Savoy meant that he was competing against Anton Edelmann, his <b>former</b> <b>boss</b> from the River Room at the hotel. Rather than serve a menu similar to the French driven Pétrus, Wareing chose to continue to serve the British cuisine that the Grill Room was known for, including his take on previous menu items such as steak and kidney pudding and potted shrimps. Pétrus went on to be awarded two Michelin stars and five AA Rosettes, while the Savoy Grill achieved its first Michelin star in the hotel's history in 2004.|$|E
