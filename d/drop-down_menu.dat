"Taiwan, China" [...] or [...] "Taiwan, Province of China" [...] {{is a set}} of {{politically}} controversial and potentially ambiguous terms that characterize Taiwan and its [...] associated territories as a province or territory of [...] "China".

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} bubbling menus, a {{new design}} for cascading <b>drop-down</b> <b>menus.</b> Bubbling menus combine the bubble cursor [10] with directional mouse-gesture techniques {{to facilitate the}} access of certain items in a menu, such as frequently selected items. Through an extensive iterative design process, we explore bubbling menus {{in the context of}} adaptive and customizable user interfaces. Unlike other adaptation and customization techniques such as split menus, bubbling menus do not disrupt the original structure of menus and enable the activation of menus far from a menu bar. Results from two evaluation studies presented in the paper show that bubbling menus provide an effective alternative to accelerate menu selections tasks.

5000|$|More recently, {{there has}} been growth in using eye {{tracking}} to study how users interact with different computer interfaces. Specific questions researchers ask are related to how easy different interfaces are for users. [...] The results of the eye tracking research can lead to changes in design of the interface.

This can include how users react to <b>drop-down</b> <b>menus</b> or where they focus their attention on a website so the developer knows where to place an advertisement.|$|R
5000|$|Epidemiological analysis: Using {{commands}} {{similar to}} those in EpiInfo, CIETanalysis produces basic frequencies (like the proportion with a given disease) through to multivariate models of gains (like the proportion that can be [...] "saved" [...] by a given intervention).

An interface with R gives access to most statistical capabilities available in that language; some of these are available through customised <b>drop-down</b> <b>menus.</b> CIETmap can import data in other formats as SPSS, dBase or Excel. Other features are available through user friendly interfaces such as meta-analysis, regression modelling, and Bayesian inference.|$|R

They eliminate syntax issues, allow {{the user to}} work with logical program chunks, provide affordances such as <b>drop-down</b> <b>menus,</b> and leverage the fact that recognition is easier than recall. However, as users gain experience and start creating larger programs, they encounter two inconvenient properties of pure blocks languages: blocks take up more screen real-estate than textual languages and dragging blocks from a palette is slower than typing. This paper describes three experiments in blurring the line between blocks and textual code in GP, a new blocks language for casual programmers currently under development...|$|R
