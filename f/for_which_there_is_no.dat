5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} {{occurring}} between noon and evening. The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm, but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have referred to a narrower timeframe.|$|E
5|$|Myths {{continued}} to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem {{from the fact that}} in early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> evidence.|$|E
5|$|Stigma is {{commonly}} experienced, around the world, {{by those with}} epilepsy. It can affect people economically, socially and culturally. In India and China, epilepsy {{may be used as}} justification to deny marriage. People in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed. In Tanzania, as in other parts of Africa, epilepsy is associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious, <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> evidence. Before 1970 the United Kingdom had laws which prevented people with epilepsy from marrying. The stigma may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they have ever had seizures.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{classify}} additive closed symmetric monoidal {{structures on}} {{the category of}} left R-modules by using Watts’ theorem. An additive closed symmetric monoidal structure is equivalent to an R-module ΛA,B equipped with two commuting right R-module structures represented by the symbols A and B, an R-module K {{to serve as the}} unit, and certain isomorphisms. We use this result to look at simple cases. We find rings R <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no additive closed symmetric monoidal structures on R-modules, <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> exactly one (up to isomorphism), <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> exactly seven, and <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a proper class of isomorphism classes of such structures. We also prove some general structural results; for example, we prove that the unit K must always be a finitely generated R-module...|$|R

5|$|Jewish {{philosophy}} {{divides the}} 613 mitzvot into three groups—laws {{that have a}} rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (mishpatim), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (edot), and laws {{that do not have}} a rational explanation (chukim). Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> particular explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and man must obey without asking why. However, Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.|$|E
