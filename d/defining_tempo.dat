Given the essential similarity of the ideas, it might be regarded as curious that mortality tempo effects have only recently been recognized and are not as yet generally accepted. The explanation for this may be that mortality tempo effects have implications that seem to be at variance with established ways of modeling and analyzing mortality and population dynamics. This paper develops a discrete approach to describing and analyzing mortality tempo effects. The discrete approach is mathematically undemanding, yet powerful.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the absence}} of a music score, tempo can only be defined by its {{perception}} by users. Thus recent studies have focused on the estimation of perceptual <b>tempo</b> <b>defined</b> by listening experiments. So far, algorithms have only been proposed to estimate the tempo when people agree on it. In this paper, we study the case when people disagree on the perception of tempo and propose an algorithm to predict this disagreement. For this, we hypothesize that the perception of tempo is correlated to a set of variations of various viewpoints on the audio content: energy, harmony, spectral-balance variations and short-term-similarity-rate. We suppose that when those variations are coherent, a shared perception of tempo is favoured and when they are not, people may perceive different tempi. We then propose several statistical models to predict the agreement or disagreement in the perception of tempo from these audio features. Finally, we evaluate the models using a test-set resulting from the perceptual experiment performed at Last-FM in 2011...|$|R

Current {{state of the art}} in onset detection, based on energy and spectral flux, cannot handle complex but common musical configurations such as dense orchestral textures. Our proposed im-provement of the flux method can detect new notes while ignoring spectral fluctuation produced by vibrato.

A new notion of dynamic metrical centroid is introduced in order to show how particular metrical levels dominate at particular moments of the music.

Training sessions were carried out weekly for three consecutive weeks. Match-to-sample tasks were adminis-tered to each subject following each session and one week after the third training session (de-layed posttest). These tasks were scored for response latency and error rate. It was found that children who observed a reflective model showed significantly longer latencies than sub-jects in both the impulsive modeling and control group following each treatment session and on the delayed posttest. No significant group dif-ferences in error rates were found following the first training session; however, the reflective model group showed significantly fewer errors than the other groups following the last two train-ing sessions and the delayed posttest. The results were discussed in terms of the educational impli-cations for the impulsive {{learning disabled}} child and previous modeling research. ognitive tempo refers to the speed with which an individual chooses an answer to a problem. There is considerable evidence to suggest that an inappropriate cognitive tempo can be disadvantageous to the school-aged child (Messer 1976). Thus the development of ways of modifying an inappropriate tempo is of extreme importance. The present study attempts to find a way of helping the learning disabled child to change a tempo that may prove harmful to his academic success.

5000|$|The work's title {{suggests}} {{an impression of}} overwhelming radiance [...] The central idea of the composition is the simultaneous layering of five different tempos. These are chosen in various combinations from a scale of seven metronomic tempos: 30, 40, 53.5, 71, 95, 134, and 180 per minute. The selection of tempos can focus on the faster or slower tempos, or combinations emphasizing the strongest oppositions. Many of the notated durations are longer than the vibraphone can sustain. For this reason, the sounds in the recording are lengthened electronically and amplitude modulated to supply an internal pulsation that <b>defines</b> the <b>tempo</b> for each layer [...] The pitches are drawn from the five melodic lines of the form scheme for Hoch-Zeiten for choir. This form scheme in turn consists of the final (Sunday) segment of the three-layered Licht superformula, with a superimposed faster version of the entire superformula compressed to the same length (only with the Lucifer layer left out). Each of these five lines is partitioned according to its changes of pitch into seven segments. Because the pitches in the different lines do not always change at the same time, the segmentation is different in each layer, and the composite changes produce a series of slow chord changes with fourteen phases. These fourteen phases also determine the tempo changes in each layer. For example, the five layers at the beginning (from high to low) are in tempos 30, 40, 95, 71, and 53.5. At {{the second of the}} fourteen sections, only the second layer changes, from 40 to 134, while the other four layers continue at their previous speeds and pitches. At the third chord, the upper four parts all change immediately, while the lowest layer begins a slow accelerando, and so on. An extra section, corresponding to the final fermata of the superformula, is added at the end. This is a quotation of the Sunday Song from the Sieben Lieder der Tage (Seven Songs of the Days), from Evas Lied, act 2, scene 4 of Montag aus Licht. Two inserts and a short introduction are also added. Each of the five layers is then composed out into two heterophonic parts, bringing the total number of parts to ten [...]|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the literature on speech tempo and the topics dealt with. Tempo {{is not one of the}} more frequently explored areas of speech research, and any possible consequences of tempo variation for other phonetic phenomena have all too often been taken for granted. Unfortunately, this field is complicated by pitfalls of definition and hazards of numerical treatment. A glance at some of the elementary textbooks yields the following. D. Jones (An Outline of English Phonetics, Cambridge 1967, § 43) put the average conversational rate of native English speakers at 300 syllables/minute and recommended this as a convenient target for foreign learners. A. Gimson (An Introduction to the Pronunciation of English, London 1962, p. 25) made several brief observations in one short paragraph in a discussion of quantity and duration: (i) "the absolute duration of sounds or syllables will, of course, depend on the speed of utterance", (ii) "an average rate of delivery might contain anything from 6 to 20 sounds per second", and (iii) "lower and higher speeds are frequently used without loss of intelligibility". These simple statements alone disclose a number of fundamental problems, such as how is speaking rate to be measured, what is the range of variation of speaking rate, how far do durations of other physical or physiological phenomena depend on speaking rate? Or, conversely, how far is speaking rate a disturbing factor in investigations of physical properties of speech, and how are speaking rate and intelligibility related? D. Abercrombie (Elements of General Phonetics, Edinburgh 1967, p. 46) had the following to say about speech rate: (i) tempo (speed of speaking) is best measured by rate of syllable succession, (ii) tempo is variable, and (iii) "everyone who starts learning a foreign language has the impression that its speakers have an exceptionally rapid tempo". This indicates a third area of interest, what is perceived tempo and what factors does it depend on? Yet another area is revealed by R. Heffner (General Phonetics, Madison 1960, § 8. 1), who discussed in particular the maximum rate of articulation available to man. Tempo is not one single, unambiguous concept, but has in fact been used to denote the rate of several different processes in speech production. Note also that the word speed has a special meaning when applied to speech tempo, referring to frequency of repetion measured as the number of units (words, morphemes, syllables, phonemes, gestures etc.) in a period of time. It does not refer to velocity. Frequency and velocity must be distinguished in the lab., precisely because they are fuzzy in everyday speech. For example, there is the issue of whether articulator velocities vary with speech rate variation. It is customary to distinguish between gross rates based on the total time of speaking, (i. e. including pauses) and net rates based on the periods of actual utterance (i. e. excluding pauses). These two fundamental measures have received various names. F. Goldman-Eisler (in a series of articles published in Language and Speech from 1958 to 1961) referred to talking rate as a measure of the entire cognitive and articulatory activity involved in the production of an utterance and articulation rate for the amount of speech produced in the time actually taken to articulate it. J. Kelly and M. Steer (Revised concept of rate, Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders 14, 222 - 226, 1949) had over-all rate (comprising "intentional pauses and unintentional pauses as well as meaningfull words spoken in the elapsed time") and phrase by phrase sentence rate excluding pauses. A decision on meaningfull words highlights the difficulty of what to do with the hesitant murmurs and uhms and ahs of filled pauses in spontaneous everyday speach. T. Clevenger and M. Clarke (Coincidental variation as a source of confusion in the experimental study of rate, Language and Speech 6, 144 - 150, 1963) defined three measures based on total time, phrase time and pause time. In addition to gross rate (total time of phrase time and pause time together) and intra-phrase rate (phrase time only), they suggested that percentage of pause (pause time as a proportion of total time) was a useful measure in the study of rate. The difference between these measures can be exemplified with same data from one of my informants, a speaker of West Greenlandic Inuit, who read a page from a novel. His style was fairly casual. He uttered 333 syllables in 31 phrases in a total time of 74 seconds, a gross (talking) rate of 4. 5 syllables/second. This indicates how fast he was communicating (i. e. composing and transmitting his message) but tells nothing of how fast he was articulating speech (which might relate to the load on the articulators from coarticulation and reduction). He articulated the 333 syllables in 50 seconds, an average net articulation rate (or intra-phrase rate) of 6. 7 syllables/second. From phrase to phrase he varied from 4. 7 to 8. 7 syllables/second. The expressions tempo and speech rate are used in different meanings by different authors. V. Kozhevnikov and L. Chistovich (Speech, Articulation and Perception, translated by Joint Publications Research Service, Washington, 1965) first <b>defined</b> <b>tempo</b> as the rate at which an articulatory program is accomplished (p. 77) and subsequently as the rate of succession of individual commands as distinct from the rate of individual movements (p. 90). They accused R. Stetson, C. Hudgins and E. Moses (Contribution à l'étude de la vitesse du débit et de la lecture dans le néerlandais, Archives Néerlandaises de Phonétique Expérimentale 14, 103 - 116, 1940) of confusing the issue by failing to observe this distinction. These three authors were studying the ranges of temporally constrained gestures, their aim being to discover factors influencing palatographic records as an aid to understanding them. This is a very different area from Kozhevnikov and Chistovitch's focus on the programming of speech articulation. In yet another area, H. Karlgren (Speech rate and information theory, Proceedings of the 4 th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, 1962) applied information theory to speech in order to study the rate of transmission of the content of the underlying message. It is tempting to regard speech rate as a source of interference that distorts the flow of speech. An inability of speech articulators to function adequately when temporally constrained might be reflected in the apparent duration dependency of many speech gestures or acoustic features as reported by, for example, Stetson et al. (1940), B. Lindblom (Spectrographic study of vowel reduction, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 35, 1773 - 1781, 1963), or T. Gay (Effect of speaking rate on diphthong formant movements, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 44, 1570 - 1573, 1968). But there is anaalternative view. Kozhevnikov and Chistovitch explicitly excluded such an interpretation of speech rate, and Karlgren postulated that the reductions associated with more rapid speech are a measure of coding efficiency. A. Lieberman et al. (Perception of the speech code, Psychological Revue 74, 431 - 461, 1967) have also emphasized the the necessity for restructuring phonemes in order to overcome the inability of the human hearing system to resolve discrete elements arriving at the rates of phoneme flow customary in speech (less than 20 /second) and the inability of the articulators to produce separate discrete gestures at such rates. They suggested that "dividing the load among the articulators allows each to operate at a reasonable pace, and tightening the code keeps the information rate high; it is this kind of parallel processing that makes it possible to get high speed performance with low speed machinary". Yet the range of possible definitions outlined above represents only some of the possibilities. The treatment of pauses requires careful consideration since this determines the duration measured for the speech sample. Similarly, the speech units counted can be concrete or abstract in various degrees. Care must be given to reduced segments. There is wide freedom for combining decisions on just these factors. Neither of the two entities involved in the computation of speech rate - duration and amount of speech - is defined a priori and the number of possible definitions of speech rate becomes very large. Then add in attempts to handle acceleration and retardation of speech rate. The literature reviewed in this overview is not exhaustive but represents what has been accessible so far. The topics dealt with appear to fall into the following areas and will be presented in the same order: measurement of duration, suitable quanta of speech, estimates of normal tempo, cognitive planning activity, causes of tempo variation, consequences of tempo variation, information theory aspects of tempo, the perception of tempo, experiment design...|$|R
40|$|Refletir sobre um exercício profissional que se constitua a partir de uma relação dialética entre trabalho consciente e os constrangimentos decorrentes do trabalho alienado torna-se um grande desafio no cotidiano profissional do assistente social. Uma possibilidade concreta que se coloca nesse aspecto insuprimível da vida social  cotidianidade  é a ética, porque possibilita a passagem das experiências vividas sob a moralidade rígida, repetitiva e muitas vezes avessa ao humano-genérico, para uma postura reflexiva diante desta. Neste sentido, {{o objetivo do estudo}} é analisar a dimensão ética quando da elaboração dos relatórios sociais construídos no cotidiano de uma instituição que executa a medida socioeducativa de internação. A elaboração deste {{instrumental}} ocupa centralidade na vida laborativa dos assistentes sociais inseridos na área sociojurídica, e, ao mesmo <b>tempo,</b> <b>define</b> a vida de indivíduos sociais que, como muitos, sofrem o processo de desumanização decorrente da sociedade fundada na propriedade privada. Para subsidiar a análise do objeto de pesquisa  a dimensão ética na elaboração dos relatórios sociais  recorre-se ao uso da pesquisa documental, que tem como fonte de coleta de dados, os relatórios produzidos por assistentes sociais inseridos no Centro de Socioeducação. O texto apresentado se organiza em duas seções. Na primeira, realizam-se apontamentos acerca da dimensão ética no cotidiano profissional e os desafios do projeto profissional do assistente social, a partir da tensa relação instituída por processos de alienação. Na segunda seção, procura-se compreender a particularidade do exercício profissional na área sociojurídica a partir de uma de suas contradições constitutivas: disciplinamento social e a afirmação dos direitos humanos. Conclui-se que, o exercício profissional do assistente social no momento de elaboração do relatório social apresenta-se com alguns limites. A alusão à base material, sobretudo da sociabilidade burguesa presente na tessitura das relações sociais estabelecidas pelos adolescentes que cometeram atos infracionais, se dá apenas a manifestações empíricas que não a revelam e que, ao contrário, a oculta. Conclui-se também que, o CENSE tem classe, pois as informações trazidas pela pesquisa revelam situações de total desproteção social e barbárie vivida pelos adolescentes e suas famílias, antes do ingresso na instituição; o acesso à proteção social praticamente inexiste; a violência interpessoal, intrafamiliar e judicial, são as tônicas das histórias sociais relatadas pelos profissionais nos relatórios. Por fim, evidencia que há uma complexa relação entre os objetivos profissionais e os objetivos institucionais; por um lado, há uma interpretação institucional alicerçada na proposta da socioeducação, que em consequência, subalterniza a interpretação de responsabilização penal juvenil e contribui, assim, para reiterar uma imagem do Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente que disfarça a natureza e a finalidade punitiva das medidas socioeducativas; por outro, valores do projeto profissional que sedimenta alicerces teórico-metodológicos, na perspectiva crítica da realidade social, não podem ser obscurecidos diante dos processos de universalização da alienação ocorridos no cotidiano. Tal prerrogativa é fundamental para garantia de que ações profissionais - e, entre elas atribuições privativas como a construção de laudos, pareceres e relatórios sociais- sejam orientadas pela reflexão ética. Reflecting about {{a professional}} exercise which is constituted from dialectics relation between conscious work and constraints from alienated {{work has been}} become a huge challenge in the professional routine of the social worker. A concrete possibility in a insuppressible aspect of the social- everydayness - is the ethics, because enable the passage of the experiences under a strict morality, repetitive and often contrary to human generic, to a reflexive posture {{in the face of these}} set of rules. In this sense, the aim of this study is to analyze the ethics dimension in the preparation of social reports constructed in the daily routine of an institution which execute the educational and social measure of admission. The preparation of this social report is central in the work life of the social workers inserted in the social-legal area, and, at the same time, define the life of the individuals in the society which, as many people, suffer the process of dehumanization due to the society founded in the private property. It was utilized the documental research to subsidize the analysis of the object of research  the ethical dimension in the preparation of social reports  in the produced reports by the social workers inserted in the Socio-educational Center. This kind of research is configured by data collection. This paper is organized in two sections. In the first section, it was realized some notes concerning to the ethical dimension in the professional routine and the challenges of the professional project of the social worker, from the tense relation instituted by process of alienation. In the second section, it is intended to understand the particularity of the professional exercise in the socio-legal area from its constitutive contradictions: the social disciplining and the affirmation of the human rights. It may conclude that, the professional exercise of the social worker in the moment of the preparation of the social report is presented with some limits. The allusion to the base material, especially of the bourgeois sociability present in the tessitura of the social relations established by the adolescents who commit infrational acts, occur only the empiric manifestations which do not reveal it and that, by the contrary, hide it. It may also concluded that, the CENSE has class, since the information showed by the research could reveal a situation of total lack of social protection the barbarism lived by the adolescents and of their families, before entering in the institution; the access to the social protection hardly exist; the interpersonal, intra-familiar and legal violence, are the tonic of the social histories reported by the professional people in the reporting. Finally, this paper intends to evidence that there is a complex relation between the professional objectives and the institutional objectives. On the one hand, there is an institutional interpretation based on the proposal of the socio-education, which in consequence, is subordinated the interpretation of the juvenile criminal liability and contribute, this way, to reiterate an image of the Statute which disguise the punitive nature and purpose of the socio-educational measures. On the other hand, values of the professional project which deposit theoretical methodological basis, in the critical perspective of the social situation, may not be obscured in front of the process of universalization of the alienation occurred in the routine. This prerogative is essential to guarantee that the professional actions  and, among them private attributions such as constructions of technical reports, feedback and reports  are orientated by the ethical reflection...|$|R
