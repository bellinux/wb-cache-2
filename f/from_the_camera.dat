5|$|The {{scene where}} Forrest spots Jenny at a peace rally at the Lincoln Memorial and Reflecting Pool in Washington, D.C., {{required}} visual effects {{to create the}} large crowd of people. Over two days of filming, approximately 1,500 extras were used. At each successive take, the extras were rearranged and moved into a different quadrant away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> With the help of computers, the extras were multiplied to create a crowd of several hundred thousand people.|$|E
5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for {{a wider range of}} colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E
5|$|Eyes Without a Face was {{released}} on VHS on January 9, 2001 by Kino Video and on DVD on October 19, 2004 by The Criterion Collection. The DVD also contains Georges Franju's first documentary Blood of the Beasts (1949), a depiction of a French slaughterhouse. A Region 2 release of Eyes Without a Face {{was released}} April 21, 2008 by Second Sight Films. A Region 4 edition of the film {{was released on}} July 2, 2007 by Umbrella Entertainment. The disc also included Franju's documentary Blood of the Beasts. In 2013, The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray, this time transferred directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> negative.|$|E

50|$|Knowledge of {{disparity}} {{can be used}} {{in further}} extraction of information from stereo images. One case that disparity is most useful is for depth/distance calculation. Disparity and distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> are inversely related. As <b>the</b> distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> increases, <b>the</b> disparity decreases. This allows for depth perception in stereo images. Using geometry and algebra, the points that appear in the 2D stereo images can be mapped as coordinates in 3D space.|$|R

5|$|The {{design of}} the command {{sequence}} to be relayed to the spacecraft and the calculations for each photograph's exposure time were developed by space scientists Candy Hansen of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Carolyn Porco of the University of Arizona. After the planned imaging sequence was taken on February 14, 1990, the data <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> was stored initially in an on-board tape recorder. Transmission to Earth was also delayed by the Magellan and Galileo missions being given priority {{over the use of}} the Deep Space Network. Then, between March and May 1990, Voyager 1 returned 60 frames back to Earth, with the radio signal travelling {{at the speed of light}} for nearly five and a half hours to cover the distance.|$|E
5|$|For {{stationary}} shots where Superman is seen flying toward or away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> {{blue screen}} matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap {{to give the}} illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would {{give the appearance of}} flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{their hotel}} room, Spears {{and her boyfriend}} start {{screaming}} at each other. When he tries to make amends and get close to her, she brushes off his attempts and walks away. Her boyfriend gets mad and then throws a vase at the wall while Spears goes into the bathroom, hurling something at the mirror. She begins to fill the bathtub and remove her clothes. After this, the video includes intercut scenes of a close-up of Spears singing in a white shirt {{in front of a}} bright white light. As she lies in the bathtub, a red string, a custom associated with Kabbalah is seen in her wrist. She touches her head and looks at her hand, realizing she is bleeding from the wound. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV, the blood in her hand is stigmata. She loses consciousness in the bathtub and drowns. Shortly after, her boyfriend finds her and tries to resuscitate her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that in the close-up scenes Spears is actually inside a hospital hallway. The video continues with scenes of her being carried into an ambulance and surrounded by photographers, as well as scenes of her being resuscitated by doctors in a hospital bed. The ghost of Spears in a white shirt, watches herself in the bed and walks into the next room, where a baby girl is born. Spears is then seen running away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> into the light. The music video ends with her rising from under the water, resting her head and smiling, suggesting the whole scene of her death was a dream or a morbid fantasy.|$|E

5|$|The {{transition}} from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds {{was accompanied by}} a focus on a more realistic presentation. In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with Final Fantasy VII; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> giving a sense of scale. The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative. Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators—some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret. Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.|$|E

25|$|Placing <b>the</b> flash away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> {{optical axis}} ensures that <b>the</b> light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> flash hits the eye at an oblique angle.

25|$|Particle image {{velocimetry}} methods will {{in general}} {{not be able}} to measure components along the z-axis (towards to/away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera).</b> These components might not only be missed, they might also introduce an interference in the data for the x/y-components caused by parallax. These problems do not exist in Stereoscopic PIV, which uses two cameras to measure all three velocity components.|$|E
25|$|This is the {{principle}} of the camera, and of the human eye. The focusing adjustment of a camera adjusts S2, as using an image distance different from that required by this formula produces a defocused (fuzzy) image for an object at a distance of S1 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> Put another way, modifying S2 causes objects at a different S1 to come into perfect focus.|$|E

25|$|Although tilt {{and swing}} are {{normally}} used {{to maximize the}} part of the image that is within the DOF, they also can be used, in combination with a small f-number, to give selective focus to a plane that isn't perpendicular to the lens axis. With this technique, it is possible to have objects at greatly different distances <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> in sharp focus and yet have a very shallow DOF. The effect can be interesting because it differs from what most viewers are accustomed to seeing.|$|E
25|$|Norshteyn uses {{a special}} {{technique}} in his animation, involving multiple glass panels {{to give his}} animation a three-dimensional look. The camera is placed at the top looking down {{on a series of}} glass panels about a meter deep (one every 25–30cm). The individual glass panels can move horizontally as well as toward and away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> (to give the effect of a character moving closer or further away). Some scenes required a different approach, {{as can be seen in}} the image on the right.|$|E
25|$|Many Stanford {{players and}} coaches objected {{immediately}} to the third lateral, from Dwight Garner to Richard Rodgers, asserting that Garner's knee was down moments beforehand. Kevin Lamar, a Stanford player who was in on the tackle, maintains that Garner's knee had hit the turf {{while he was still}} in possession of the ball; Garner and Rodgers themselves, however, assert the opposite. TV replays were inconclusive; due to the distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> and the swarm of tacklers, one cannot see the exact moment Garner's knee may have touched.|$|E
