Participants were 15 nonsmokers reporting daily SHS exposure and 15 light or nondaily cigarette smokers. We coded responses <b>from</b> <b>audiotaped</b> semistructured interviews for themes. No participant spontaneously identified heart risks related to SHS exposure. Strategies to avoid SHS included verbal requests to not smoke and physically avoiding smoke; both smokers and nonsmokers prioritized politeness over urgency. Most participants thought a blood test quantifying SHS exposure would be clinically useful. Health education, assertiveness communication training, and protective policies (eg, smoke-free multiunit housing) also were supported.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} a pregnancy and other counselee characteristics on several aspects of counselor-counselee interaction during the initial clinical genetic consultation. METHODS: The consultations, of a group of pregnant women (n = 82) and of a control group of non-pregnant women (n = 58), were compared specifically with regard to differences in global affective tone, extent of psychosocial exchange and women's participation in the decision-making process. Consultations were recorded, and subsequently coded <b>from</b> <b>audiotape</b> by 10 raters. RESULTS: Only two differences in outcome measures were found between the two study groups: the counselor was rated as slightly more nervous in consultations with pregnant women, and in consultations with non-pregnant women fewer decisions were taken. The length of the consultation, the contribution of a counselee's companion to the consultation and counselee characteristics (age, level of education, initiation of referral, affected person, degree of worry and preferred participation in decision-making) were more important in explaining the nature of the interaction. CONCLUSION: Our study yielded no important differences in counselor-counselee interaction during the initial clinical genetic consultation of pregnant versus non-pregnant women regarding the affective tone of the consultation, the degree to which psychosocial issues were discussed and the women's participation in the decision-making process. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that a negatively affected counselor-counselee interaction is not an important disadvantage in consultations with pregnant women. Given the limitations of our study, however, we advocate further studies on counselor-counselee interaction in reproductive genetic counseling, in order {{to improve the quality of}} reproductive genetic counselin...|$|E

40|$|Although rarely studied, physician-patient {{interactions}} {{immediately following}} diagnostic tests are significant medical events because during these encounters the physician and patient often {{make decisions about}} major and sometimes invasive treatment. This investigation analyzed patterns of physician-patient communication following coronary angiography with particular attention to behaviors important to decision-making: physician information-giving, physician use of partnership-building, and active forms of patient participation (e. g., asking questions, being assertive, expressing concerns). We were particularly interested in effects related to the patient's race in light of documented evidence of racial disparities in cardiac care and outcomes. <b>From</b> <b>audiotape</b> recordings, 93 physician-patient interactions after coronary angiogram in a catheterization laboratory in a large US Veterans Affairs Medical Center were coded to measure the frequency of physicians' information-giving and partnership-building {{and the frequency of}} active patient participation. We also stratified these behaviors according to whether the behavior was prompted (e. g., physician information in response to a patient's question; a patient's opinion solicited by the doctor) or self-initiated. Several findings were noteworthy. First, these interactions were very brief and dominated by the physician. Second, although physician information-giving increased with more active patient participation, which in turn was correlated with physicians' use of partnership-building, proportionally little of the physicians' information (8 %) and active patient participation (9 %) was directly prompted by the other interactant. Finally, there was a tendency for physicians to self-initiate less information giving to black patients and for black patients to self-initiate less active participation than white patients. Although these differences were attenuated when other variables (e. g., the physician's training, disease severity) were included in the analysis, the pattern suggests a potential cycle of passivity where certain patients tend to receive fewer informational resources and these patients in turn do less to prompt the doctor for more.

The {{aims of the}} study were to determine: (1) what effect the instructional strategy had on achieving conceptual change; (2) what devices or strategies students used in their attempts to understand physics, and which of these factors were important; and (3) how robust new conceptions were, and to what extent they were used in unfamiliar situations. Seven students in a mechanics section of a first-year physics course were observed during a 12 -week period.

The aims of {{this study}} were to examine how GPs manage the {{consultation}} for upper resiratory tract infections (URTIs) and the prescribing of antibiotics, to understand what skills and strategies are used in managing URTIs without antibiotics, and to note evidence of pressure on doctors to prescribe and whether there are signs of overt disagreement about prescribing in the consultation. Methods. A qualitative analysis of audiotaped consultations was carried out. The setting was a general practice in South Wales and the subjects were five GPs and 29 parents presenting children with URTIs over a 2 -week period. The main outcome measures were skills and strategies identified <b>from</b> <b>audiotapes</b> of consultations. Results. This group of GPs used a set of readily identifiable consulting skills for managing the consultation without prescribing. Their consultations had a highly routinized quality. There was little evidence of either conflict or overt pressure from parents to prescribe. The word ‘antibiotics' was seldom mentioned. Clinicians did not elicit patient expectations for receiving antibiotics. Conclusions. Doctors use a set of readily identifiable skills in managing the URTI consultation. Avoiding the prescribing of antibiotics is not necessarily a simple and straightforward matter. Since patients apparently want antibiotics less than anticipated, eliciting expectations might be a way of reducing prescribing and broadening the approach to meeting patient needs. Whether doctors can adjust their routinized consulting patterns in the time-limited context of general practice remains an open question...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This explorative, {{qualitative}} study examines {{the perceptions of}} mental health workers about self-help groups with adult survivors of child sexual abuse. Given limited formal mental health services in South Africa, self-help represents one informal alternative which could supplement mental health service provision. The study thus arises from a perspective which values self-help groups and is informed by the urgency of community needs in this area, and takes seriously {{the idea that it}} is possible and desirable for mental health care workers to facilitate and foster community support systems. Twenty-two indepth interviews were conducted with a sample of convenience which included eleven clinical psychologists, five psychiatrists, three social workers and three non-professionals and included interviewees from organizations currently engaged in issues relating to child sexual abuse. A semi-structured interview schedule was used and interviews were audio-taped. Interview responses were systematically analysed and common themes extracted around awareness of self-help, perceived benefits and problems of survivor self-help groups and the role of professionals. Main themes have been illustrated by verbatim transcriptions <b>from</b> <b>audiotaped</b> material. Most participants have had limited exposure to self-help groups. Whilst there was openness towards self-help with survivors, caution was expressed about dangers to clients in survivor groups which are not monitored by formally trained and accredited professionals. Selfhelp was considered useful mainly as an adjunct to formal services. Limited knowledge of self-help groups is a major determining factor informing professional perceptions. Recommendations for education of professionals are made in order to promote self-help groups and collaborative professional attitudes...|$|R
