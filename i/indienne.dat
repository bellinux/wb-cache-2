5|$|At 19:00, {{delayed by}} {{the effect of}} the Rock of Gibraltar on the wind, the British {{squadron}} rounded Gibraltar and found the French and Spanish ships still assembling at Cabrita Point. The light wind prevented any rapid movement, and Saumarez began to slowly tack towards the combined squadron in line of battle formation. The delay with Moreno's departure had been due to the state of the captured Hannibal, renamed Annibal, which was unable to make any progress under its jury masts and had been taken under tow by the frigate <b>Indienne.</b> Sighting Saumarez's force, Moreno instructed <b>Indienne</b> and Hannibal to return to Algeciras and at 19:45 issued orders {{for the remainder of the}} squadron to sail eastwards through the Gut of Gibraltar towards Cadiz. He also, following Spanish naval tradition, disembarked his flagship Real Carlos and transferred to the frigate Sabina, persuading Linois to quit Formidable and do the same.|$|E
5|$|Although Gambier had no {{intention}} of risking his fleet in the narrow waters of Basque Roads, he had permitted three more transports to be fitted out as fireships, and at 17:30 these were led into the anchorage by Stopford in Caesar, accompanied by Theseus and several launches quipped to fire Congreve rockets. At 19:40 however Caesar grounded on a shoal and remained stuck there until 22:30, close to Valiant, which had also grounded at low tide. At this point six surviving French ships; Océan, four of the line and the frigate <b>Indienne,</b> remained aground close to the mouth of the Charente, while the remainder of the fleet had escaped upriver to secure anchorages. During the night the wind blew from the land, rendering a fireship attack impractical, and so the British contented themselves with setting Ville de Varsouvie and Aquilon on fire, both ships determined by John Bligh on Valiant, over Cochrane's objections, to have been damaged beyond repair. During this operation, one of the new fireships was wrecked on a shoal. The weather was so bad that night that the planned attack with the remaining fireships was abandoned as unfeasible.|$|E
5|$|At 02:00 on 15 April Océan {{finally began}} to move again, {{reaching}} safety upriver by 03:30. Several other ships were exposed, but without a bomb vessel they lay beyond {{the range of the}} British fleet. The French sailors made significant efforts to retrieve these ships over the following days; on 16 April <b>Indienne</b> was deemed too damaged to be saved, abandoned, and set on fire. The frigate exploded at midday. The following day Foudroyant and Tourville reached safety, and only Régulus now remained vulnerable. For several days in severe gales and heavy rain the ship remained stranded in the mud while Wolfe worked to bring up newly arrived replacement bomb vessel HMS Thunder. An attack on 20 April failed after the gun spilt almost immediately, and a larger scale attack with both bomb vessels and smaller ships failed on 24 April. No further attempts were made to destroy Régulus, and on 29 April the ship was finally refloated and brought to safety in the Charente. On the same day Gambier finally abandoned his blockade of the river and sailed his fleet for England.|$|E

5|$|In August 1798, the French Mediterranean Fleet {{was largely}} {{destroyed}} by a British fleet at the Battle of the Nile during the French invasion of Egypt. With the Royal Navy dominant in the Mediterranean Sea and their army trapped in Egypt, the French sought in 1801 to augment their depleted forces in the region by sending reinforcements from the Atlantic Fleet and by purchasing ships from the Spanish Navy, based in Cadiz. A squadron sailed from Brest on the Atlantic in January and made three failed attempts to reach Egypt, which was facing a large British invasion, before abandoning the effort and retiring to Toulon on the French Mediterranean coast. Three ships of the line, Formidable, Indomptable and Desaix, had been detached from the squadron in May however and were subsequently placed {{under the command of}} Contre-Admiral Charles Linois under orders to sail for Cadiz. At Cadiz, the Spanish fleet had agreed to sell six ships of the line to the French Navy, and on 13 June two French frigates, Libre and <b>Indienne,</b> arrived at the port to oversee the transfer under the command of Contre-Admiral Dumanoir le Pelley.|$|E
25|$|Libre {{was built}} at Le Havre, {{launched}} in 1796, and commissioned there on 24 December 1800 under Commander Bourdet. She sailed from Le Havre in March 1801 {{in the company}} of <b>Indienne</b> towards Cherbourg, then Cadiz and La Corogne, before cruising to Saint-Domingue and into the North Sea.|$|E
25|$|Lenzburg was conquered by Bern in 1415, {{along with}} {{the western part of}} current Aargau, though Bern did not take away its city rights. In 1433, the city of Bern bought the castle and used it to govern the region from 1444 to 1798. A major fire devastated the town in 1491, sparing only fifteen houses. The Reformation was carried out {{simultaneously}} {{with the rest of the}} region in 1528, and the economy started to transform slowly from an agrarian to a more industrial one in the 16th century. In the 18th century Lenzburg developed into a centre for cotton trade and processing. An <b>Indienne</b> textile factory was founded in 1732.|$|E

25|$|The queen spent {{heavily on}} fashion, luxuries and gambling, though {{the country was}} facing a grave {{financial}} crisis and the population was suffering. Rose Bertin created dresses for her, and hair styles such as poufs, up to three feet (90cm) high, and the panache (a spray of feather plumes). She and her court also adopted the English fashion of dresses made of <b>indienne</b> (a material banned in France from 1686 until 1759), percale and muslin. By {{the time of the}} Flour War of 1775, a series of riots against the high price of flour and bread, her reputation among the general public was no better than that of the favorites of the previous kings. In fact, many in the country were beginning to blame her for the degrading economic situation, suggesting the country’s inability to pay off its debt was the result of her wasting the crown’s money. Through correspondence, Marie Antoinette's mother, Maria Theresa, expressed concern over her daughter's spending habits, citing the civil unrest it was beginning to cause.|$|E
500|$|As dawn rose on 12 April, only Cassard and Foudroyant {{remained}} afloat, having {{drifted into}} the mouth of the Charente with the tide. The remainder, nine ships of the line, Calcutta and four frigates, were all beached along the mud and rocky shoals of the channel. Océan lay isolated on the mud within Aix Roads itself, with Ville de Varsovie and Aquilon grounded on rocks at Charenton [...] away and Régulus and Jemmappes on softer ground nearby. To the north, Tonnerre had grounded hard near Île Madame and despite desperate efforts from the crew had already flooded and become a total wreck. Calcutta lay on the Palles Shoal near the remains of Jean-Bart and Patriote and Tourville had grounded close to the mouth of the Charente not far from the frigate Pallas. Elsewhere <b>Indienne</b> lay at Pointe Aiguille and Elbe and Hortense on the Fontanelles.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{as serious}} however were the legal ramifications of the battle. In both {{countries}} {{there was a}} storm of controversy; in France four captains faced courts-martial from 21 June on charges of having abandoned their ships too easily and failing to follow orders. The captain of Tonnerre was acquitted, the captain of <b>Indienne</b> was acquitted on the first charge but sentenced to three months house arrest for the second and the captain of Tourville was sentenced {{to two years in}} prison and to be dismissed the Navy for abandoning his ship prematurely. The captain of Calcutta, Jean-Baptiste Lafon, was convicted of abandoning his ship {{in the face of the}} enemy and sentenced to death on 8 September. The execution was carried out by firing squad on the deck of Océan the following day. Woodman considers that [...] "these wretched officers paid the penalty for Willaumez's initial timidity." [...] Allemand's defeat is often blamed on Napoleon's instructions before the battle, which mistakenly assumed that the Aix Roads were a safe anchorage.|$|E

500|$|With both squadrons badly damaged, {{reinforcements}} {{were called}} for, Linois sending a messenger overland to Cadiz with an appeal for the Spanish fleet there, under Admiral Don Jose de Mazzaredo {{to send a}} squadron to escort the French force in Algeciras {{to the safety of}} Cadiz. At Cadiz, le Pelley had to plead with Mazzaredo for assistance, the Spanish admiral agreeing on 8 July to send a powerful squadron under Vice-Admiral Don [...] to Algeciras. Moreno's force consisted of two 112-gun first rate ships of the line, Real Carlos and San Hermenegildo, the 96-gun San Fernando, 80-gun Argonauta and the 74-gun San Agustín. With this force was the 74-gun French ship Saint Antoine, which a few days earlier had been the Spanish San Antonio. Saint Antoine {{was the first of the}} French ships purchased from the Spanish Navy to enter service, the crew drawn from the crews of le Pelley's frigates supplemented by Spanish sailors and commanded by Commodore Julien le Ray. With the squadron were the frigates Libre, <b>Indienne</b> and the Spanish Sabina as well as the French lugger Vautour.|$|E
500|$|Linois {{also began}} a {{programme}} of refloating and making extensive repairs to his ships, including the captured Hannibal, which he renamed Annibal. Jury masts {{were set up}} on the battered hulk, although such extensive repairs were required that when Linois sailed a week later the ship was still only just seaworthy, and was sent back to Algeciras. In Cadiz, despite Spanish hesitation, the messages from Linois coupled with strong representations from le Pelley prompted Mazzaredo to order a squadron to sea on the morning of 9 July, commanded by Vice-Admiral Don [...] and including two very large first rate ships of the line: Real Carlos and San Hermenegildo, each mustering 112 guns. The remainder of the squadron consisted of a 96-gun Spanish ship, an 80-gun Spanish ship, a 74-gun Spanish ship as well as the 74-gun ship Saint Antoine, which a few days earlier had been the Spanish San Antonio. The first of the purchased ships of the line to be commissioned into the French Navy, Saint Antonines crew was drawn from the men brought to Cadiz on the frigates Libre and <b>Indienne,</b> supplemented by a number of Spanish sailors and commanded by Commodore Le Ray. Accompanying the squadron were the frigates Libre, the Spanish Sabina and the French lugger Vautour.|$|E
500|$|As night {{approached}} {{it became clear}} that the wind, although blowing in the correct direction, was too strong to allow the fireships to be chained together in squadrons as planned, and each was instructed to operate independently. At 20:30, with the wind and tide in their favour and the night darker than expected, the fireships cut their anchor cables and began to silently sail towards the French fleet. Most of the volunteer crews ignited and abandoned their vessels too early, the blazing ships grounding long before even reaching the boom; one even threatened Imperieuse, which had to veer its anchor cable to avoid being destroyed. Other crews, including those on one of the explosion ships, lost control of their vessels and took no part in the attack. A few however, including the lead explosion ship under Cochrane's personal command, continued forward at speed, as the wind increased gradually. He was followed by the second surviving explosion vessel, on board of which was Midshipman Frederick Marryat. [...] Cochrane delayed igniting his own ship to the last minute, and when he finally lit the fuses his escape was reportedly delayed in a search for the ship's dog. As a result, his boat was still inside the debris field when the ship exploded, and he escaped unharmed. Elsewhere, five British sailors were killed and six wounded in premature detonations. The explosion ships detonated near the French frigate <b>Indienne</b> at 21:30 and 21:40, although trapped by the boom they did little damage. [...] Following them however was Mediator, which smashed a hole in the boom through which the few fireships surviving followed.|$|E

500|$|The {{presence}} of this force at Toulon enabled the French to plan a secondary operation using Ganteaume's new arrivals. A deal had been brokered {{earlier in the year}} between Bonaparte and Charles IV of Spain for the Spanish government to provide six ships of the line from the Cadiz fleet to the French Navy. Orders were given that the new squadron at Cadiz was to be joined by the three ships of the line detached from Ganteaume's squadron, as well as the frigate Muiron under the overall command of Rear-Admiral Charles Linois. This force of nine French ships, accompanied by six promised vessels from the Spanish fleet, was then to fulfil one of two mooted plans: the first was a large scale attack on Lisbon. Portugal and Spain were engaged in the War of the Oranges and Lisbon was a major British trading port: the French admiral Kerguelen had estimated some years earlier that an attack there could seize as much as [...] "2 millions" [...] of British goods and shipping. The other planned operation, adopted following the end of the War of the Oranges on 2 June, was for the force to resupply Egypt using soldiers stationed at Italian ports. To facilitate the transfer of the Spanish ships to French control, Napoleon ordered Contre-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley to sail to Cadiz. Le Pelley arrived at the Spanish port on 13 June in the frigates Libre and <b>Indienne</b> with sailors to begin manning the newly purchased ships and Commodore Julien le Ray to command them. His arrival was noted by the British blockade squadron off Cadiz under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez, a veteran of the Battle of the Nile and one of Lord Nelson's famous [...] "Band of Brothers": Le Pelley's ships were chased by HMS Superb and HMS Venerable, but the French admiral managed to evade his pursuers and reach Cadiz safely. Saumarez had been ordered to Cadiz in May 1801 with orders not only to blockade the Spanish fleet, but also specifically to watch for an attempt by a French squadron to link with the Spanish fleet at Cadiz.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of March 1809 Whiting joined the fleet assembling for {{an attack on the}} French fleet in the Basque Roads. William Congreve, who had arrived with a transport, fitted Whiting and the two the hired armed cutters Nimrod and King George with rockets. On 11 April the three vessels took up a position near the Boyart (see Fort Boyard) Shoal while fireships made a night attack on the French ships. The next day all three, together with a number of other vessels, opened fire upon the French ships Océan, Régulus, and the frigate <b>Indienne,</b> as those ships lay aground. The first two eventually escaped, and the last was one of four eventually destroyed, though by her own crew some days later to avoid capture.
