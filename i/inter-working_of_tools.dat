40|$|Abstract. The Verified Software Repository is {{dedicated}} to a long-term vision of {{a future in which}} all computer systems justify the trust that Society increasingly places in them. This will be accompanied by a substantial reduction in the current high costs of programming error, incurred during the design, development, testing, installation, maintenance, evolution, and retirement of computer software. An important technical contribution to this vision will be a Verifying Compiler: a tool that automatically proves that a program will always meet its requirements, insofar as these have been formalised, without even needing to run it. This has been a challenge for computing research for over thirty years, but {{the current state of the}} art now gives grounds for hope that it may be implemented in the foreseeable future. Achievement of the overall vision will depend also on continued progress of research into dependability and software evolution, as envisaged by the UKCRC Grand Challenge project in Dependable Systems Evolution. The Verified Software Repository is a first step towards the realisation of this long-term vision. It will maintain and develop an evolving collection of state-of-the art tools, together with a representative portfolio of real programs and specifications on which to test, evaluate and develop the tools. It will contribute initially to the <b>inter-working</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools,</b> and eventually to their integration. It will promote transfer of the relevant technology to industrial tools and into software engineering practice in the UK. The Repository wil...|$|E
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 77 - 84). The use of WLAN for {{the provision}} of IP multimedia services faces a number of challenges which include quality of service (QoS). Because WLAN users access multimedia services usually over a wired backbone, attention must be paid to QoS over the integrated WLAN-wired network. This research focuses on {{the provision of}} QoS to WLAN users accessing multimedia services over a wired backbone. In this thesis, the IEEE 802. 11 - 2007 enhanced data channel access (EDCA) mechanism is used to provide prioritized QoS on the WLAN media access control (MAC) layer, while weighted round robin (WRR) queue scheduling is used to provide prioritized QoS at the IP layer. The <b>inter-working</b> <b>of</b> the EDCA scheme in the WLAN and the WRR scheduling scheme in the wired network provides end-to-end QoS on a WLAN-wired IP network.

40|$|Abstract: Recently, growing {{availability}} of emerging wireless technologies has pushed the demand to integrate different wireless-network technologies such as: wireless local-area networks, cellular networks, and personal and short-range networks. The <b>inter-working</b> <b>of</b> heterogeneous radio access networks poses many technical challenges, with mobility management {{being one of}} the most important. In this paper we survey the existing proposals and show that transport-layer mobility is a viable candidate for implementing seamless handover in heterogeneous wireless access networks. Since the mobile Stream Control Transmission Protocol (mSCTP) {{is at the core of}} most relevant transport-layer mobility schemes being currently studied, we identify the key scenarios where the protocol can effectively leverage the multihoming feature to enhance handover support. Moreover, to provide the reader with a complete overview of the mSCTP's application area, we also survey the situations where the use of mSCTP-based schemes is not possible or has some limitations. Then, in one of the identified key scenarios, we investigate several challenging open issues related to path management and path-transition optimization by considering bandwidth-estimation schemes and link-layer support.

40|$|Executive summary The SPICE {{platform}} aims {{to research}} and prototype a scalable overlay architecture for the rapid creation and deployment of intelligent and personalized services. In order to support this requirement, the platform must be composed of technology enablers that allow the services to be malleable {{with regard to their}} personalisation and customisation.

Systems, such as the SPICE platform, can be reasonably referred to as enabling intelligence when the services executing upon it act rationally.

40|$|There {{have been}} many changes {{in the face of}} {{computing}} in past decade, one of which is undoubtedly the introduction of mobile computing. The ability to be connected to the Internet at all times with the best available access network introduces an idea of Always-Best-Connected (ABC) services. However, {{with a wide range of}} access technologies and mobile-networked devices together with increasing demands of mobile users, introduces the notion <b>of</b> integration and <b>inter-working</b> <b>of</b> these heterogeneous access networks. To realise the mobility requirement of mobile users, network service providers need to dynamically manage their network resources and be able to adapt according to the present network conditions, while continually providing agreed-services to their home and guest users. This requires a centralised monitoring and management system. Sometimes referred to as 4 th generation (4 G) networks, the overall objective is to provide a managed ABC services over underlying heterogeneous wireless and mobile platforms while maintaining negotiated security and Quality of Service in an open and customisable environment. This paper provides an overview of a proposed layered model and its architecture, which is based upon Policy-based Management (PBM).

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{significant}} interest in the integration and co-existence of Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) with other Radio Access Technologies, like IEEE 802. 11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). Although, the <b>inter-working</b> <b>of</b> IEEE 802. 11 WLANs with 3 GPP LTE has indicated enhanced network performance {{in the context of}} capacity and load balancing, the WLAN discovery scheme implemented in most of the commercially available smartphones is very inefficient and results in high battery drainage. In this paper, we have proposed an energy efficient WLAN discovery scheme for 3 GPP LTE and IEEE 802. 11 WLAN inter-working scenario. User Equipment (UE), in the proposed scheme, uses 3 GPP network assistance along with the results of past channel scans, to optimally select the next channels to scan. Further, we have also developed an algorithm to accurately estimate the UE's mobility state, using 3 GPP network signal strength patterns. We have implemented various discovery schemes in Android framework, to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme against other solutions in the literature. Since, Android does not support selective scanning mode, we have implemented modules in Android to enable selective scanning. Further, we have also used simulation studies and justified the results using power consumption modeling. The results from the field experiments and simulations have shown high power savings using the proposed scanning scheme without any discovery performance deterioration...|$|R
40|$|As Congress {{considers}} immigration reform, {{public debate}} {{has focused on}} border enforcement and whether the undocumented should be provided with a “path to citizenship. ” Underlying this debate is a tacit assumption that issues of border enforcement center on persons who lack a legal status to reside in the United States or who are attempting to evade immigration authorities. The border looms large, however, for millions of immigrants who have a legal status or who have fully presented themselves to immigration authorities {{in their efforts to}} obtain permanent status. For these immigrants, short term travel, including a trip of a few days to attend a family funeral, can lead to a permanent bar to readmission. As a result, the border operates invisibly as a force that keeps immigrants in their homes in the United States and stops them from traveling. This paper examines how current immigration law restricts travel by noncitizens, including travel by lawful permanent residents and the spouses of United States citizens. It shows that as a result <b>of</b> the <b>inter-working</b> <b>of</b> various statutory and regulatory interpretations, these restrictions permeate the overall statutory and regulatory scheme governing noncitizens. At that same time, the restrictions generally lack any articulated rationale. Some were enacted without explanation. Others are carryovers from past legislative schemes.

Finally, it looks at the role that could be played by the courts, agencies and Congress in achieving a more humane and rational system for regulating travel...|$|R
40|$|The geo-data {{infrastructure}} (GDI) has {{for long}} been {{developed as a}} network for spatial data discovery and access. As a result spatial data, in distributed and heterogeneous databases, are readily accessible and sharable. Spatial data abundance notwithstanding, a rapidly growing segment of the geoinformation market comprises non-expert GIS users who seldom seek raw data but rather demand value-added information products and services of varying complexity. Increasingly, traditional geo-data infrastructures fail to fully {{meet the needs of}} emerging markets. Further, increased competition, demand for lean enterprises, pervasive e-commerce and rapid gravitation towards Internet GIS all compound to motivate the concept of a novel service-centred infrastructure that enables delivery of geo-information services and products typically beyond the capability of any single organization. Such a service-centred infrastructure has variously referred to as the Geographical Services Infrastructure (GSI). The GSI operates as a virtual enterprise comprising dynamic collaborations of many organizations partnering on the basis of core competencies and shared business objectives. The development of such an enterprise requires the design of an integrated platform that enables interoperability and <b>inter-working</b> <b>of</b> functional entities within heterogeneous environment.

This research proposes a new model and its architecture for policy-based management (PBM) to provide a framework for the centralised management of networks based on business-level policies. This work extends existing IETF Policy-based Network Management (PBNM) model by introducing a new layered-approach which facilitates the negotiation of management services over interconnected heterogeneous mobile platforms, thus achieving an ABC scenario. The proposed layered-approach provides flexibility to the organisations so that they can choose favourable semantic and syntactic approaches and facilitates the separation of management policies from their implementation in a distributed and heterogeneous environment. The extended Policy Information Model and a new policy conflict detection technique are also introduced. Further, we have proposed and implemented a new model of a policy-managed mobile client and its architecture to support seamless handoff across multiple access networks. The proposed mobile client supports multi-domain authentication and security along with downloadable user profiles.
