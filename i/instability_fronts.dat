40|$|Traveling fronts {{can become}} transversally {{unstable}} {{either because of}} a diffusive instability arising when the key variables diffuse at sufficiently different rates or because of a buoyancy-driven Rayleigh-Taylor mechanism when the density jump across the front is statically unfavorable. The interaction between such diffusive and buoyancy <b>instabilities</b> of <b>fronts</b> is analyzed theoretically for a simple model system. Linear stability analysis and nonlinear simulations show that their interplay changes considerably the stability properties {{with regard to the}} pure Rayleigh-Taylor or diffusive <b>instabilities</b> of <b>fronts.</b> In particular, an instability scenario can arise which triggers convection around statically stable fronts as a result of differential diffusion. Moreover, spatiotemporal chaos can be observed when both buoyancy and diffusive effects cooperate to destabilize the front. Experimental conditions to test our predictions are suggested.

An important question in early reionization and chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium is whether such instabilities arose in the H II regions of the first stars and primeval galaxies, which were devoid of metals. We present three-dimensional numerical simulations that reveal both shadow and thin-shell instabilities readily formed in primordial gas. We find that the hard UV spectra of Population III stars broadened primordial ionization fronts, causing H 2 formation capable of inciting violent thin- shell <b>instabilities</b> in D-type <b>fronts,</b> even in the presence of intense Lyman-Werner flux. The high post- front gas temperatures associated with He ionization sustained and exacerbated shadow instabilities, unaided by molecular hydrogen cooling. Our models indicate that metals eclipsed H 2 cooling in I-front instabilities at modest concentrations, from 0. 001 - 0. 01 solar. We conclude that ionization <b>front</b> <b>instabilities</b> were prominent in the H II regions of the first stars and galaxies, influencing the escape of ionizing radiation and metals into the early universe.

40|$|International audienceAtomic step edges can {{exhibit a}} {{morphological}} instability under step-flow conditions (the so-called Bales-Zangwill instability). Such instabilities are {{ascribed to the}} fact that adatoms approaching a step from opposite directions do not see the same energy barrier to step incorporation (Ehrlich-Schwoebel or ES effect). Due to the very low solubility of carbon in the melt, Ti 3 SiC 2 grown from a Ti-Si liquid phase is an experimental example of two-dimensional (2 D) growth. In addition, the ratio between the incorporation rates at a step from the lower terrace and from the upper terrace is probably very high. The latter particularity makes the steps lying below a terrace including an unstable step independent from the forming instability, so that an <b>instability</b> <b>front</b> may appear just on one terrace, whereas the neighboring steps remain stable. Besides, foreign-particle-assisted growth can result in the production of extremely elongated islands or peninsulas on a given terrace, which then form very long grooves between the island edge and the upper terrace step. This provides the ability to test the respective stability of lines and grooves on a single terrace, and to verify that shrinking grooves are more stable than simple steps, as recently demonstrated by another author...|$|R
40|$|Liesegang {{patterns}} {{emerge from}} precipitation processes {{and may be}} used to build bulk structures at submicron lengthscales. Thus they have significant potential for technological applications provided adequate methods of control can be devised. Here we describe a simple, physically realizable pattern-control based on the notion of driven precipitation, meaning that the phase-separation is governed by a guiding field such as, for example, a temperature or a pH field. The phase-separation is modeled through a non-autonomous Cahn-Hilliard equation whose spinodal is determined by the evolving guiding field. Control over the dynamics of the spinodal gives control over the velocity of the <b>instability</b> <b>front</b> which separates the stable and unstable regions of the system. Since the wavelength of the pattern is largely determined by this velocity, the distance between successive precipitation bands becomes controllable. We demonstrate the above ideas by numerical studies of a 1 D system with diffusive guiding field. We find that the results can be accurately described by employing a linear stability analysis (pulled-front theory) for determining the velocity [...] local-wavelength relationship. From the perspective of the Liesegang theory, our results indicate that the so-called revert patterns may be naturally generated by diffusive guiding fields.

In this study, the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) daily 300 m data were used to study small-scale processes in the western South China Sea. It is indicated that the cyclonic eddies with horizontal scales of 10 km are frequently observed during the upwelling season of each year over the 2004 – 2009 period. These small-scale eddies were generated {{in the vicinity of}} the southern front of the cold tongue, and then propagated eastward with a speed of approximately 12 cm s − 1. This propagation speed was consistent with the velocity of the western boundary current. As a result, the small-scale eddies kept the high levels of phytoplankton rotating away from the coastal areas, resulting in the accumulation of phytoplankton in the interior of the eddies. The generation of the small-scale eddies may be associated with strengthening of the relative movement between the rotation speed of the anticyclonic mesoscale eddies and the offshore transport. With the increases of the normalized rotation speed of the anticyclonic mesoscale eddies relative to the offshore transport, the offshore current became a meander under the impacts of the anticyclonic mesoscale eddies. The meandered cold tongue and <b>instability</b> <b>front</b> may stimulate the generation of the small-scale eddies.

40|$|Curling {{deformation}} of thin elastic sheets appears in numerous structures in nature, such as membranes of red blood cells, epithelial tissues or green algae colonies to cite {{just a few}} examples. However, despite its ubiquity, the dynamics of curling propagation in a naturally curved material remains still poorly investigated. Here, we present a coupled experimental and theoretical study of the dynamical curling {{deformation of}} naturally curved ribbons. Using thermoplastic and metallic ribbons molded on cylinders of different radii, we tune separately the natural curvature and the geometry to study curling dynamics in air, water and in viscous oils, thus spanning {{a wide range of}} Reynolds numbers. Our theoretical and experimental approaches separate the role of elasticity, gravity and hydrodynamic dissipation from inertia and emphasize the fundamental differences between the curling of a naturally curved ribbon and a rod described by the classical Elastica. Ribbons are indeed an intermediate class of objects between rods, which can be totally described by one-dimensional deformations, and sheets. Since Lord Rayleigh, it is known that a thin sheet can easily be bent but not stretched. As a result, large deformations in thin sheets usually lead to the localization of deformations into small peaks and ridges as observed by crumpling a simple piece of paper. These elastic defects induce critical buckling situations studied in detail statically in the literature, while experimental and theoretical studies on their dynamics are scarce. Our work shows evidence for the propagation of such a single <b>instability</b> <b>front,</b> selected by a local buckling mechanism.

This last spontaneous preferential flow cannot be described by the standard Richards equation. Cueto-Felgueroso and Juanes proposed recently a phase field model {{in order to take}} into account a macroscopic surface tension effect at the front [1]. Their model simulates successfully the interface instability of an advancing front. We aim at simulating and understanding <b>front</b> <b>instability</b> passing a textural soil discontinuity for which the finger flow is particularly visible. We consider sand layers with different characteristics such as granulometry. Moreover, the wettability is taken into account by adding a hydrophobic term in the free energy of the phase field model. The hydrophobicity part is not only relevant for repellent soil but also to model the ultra-thin films [2]. Therefore, in our framework, this may have an influence at the front because the water saturation is nearly zero. Such a wettability influence on infiltration in porous media has recently been measured in [3]. The governing equation is analogous to the lubrication equation for which we pointed out the specific numerical difficulties [4]. A numerical code to perform time integration and bifurcation analysis was developed in [4] allowing to determine the onset of instability and its resulting dynamics in the parameter space [5]. We compute the parameter range for which the front stops when reaching the layers interface. As in [4], there is two main mechanisms that allow water to cross over the discontinuity. A first mechanism, called «depinning», leads to an intermittent flow and the second one, to a <b>front</b> <b>instability</b> and then to a finger flow. There is a parameter domain where both instabilities are present leading to a complex spatio-temporal dynamics.

Upon ponding with dye-coloured water, fingers emerged, propagated downward and diverged when reaching the capillary fringe. Microtensiometers were installed in the induction zone, the fingers, and in the capillary fringe. In the induction zone, a lateral sinusoidal pressure head developed within minutes. Only in one of two experiments could the observed pressure head pattern be satisfactorily reproduced by a steady-state model assuming uniform induction zone properties and uniform infiltration. Later, fingers emerged below the pressure head minima. The induction zone did not affect finger properties. The pressure head in the induction zone was determined by the depth of the finger tips.
