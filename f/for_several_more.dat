5|$|By July7, most of {{the deep}} {{convection}} associated with Blanca had dissipated, and the remaining convection was confined to an outer band southeast of the center. Later that day, the system was barely holding on to tropical storm intensity as the center became devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. A brief burst in convection allowed Blanca to maintain 40mph (65km/h) winds, minimal tropical storm intensity, <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>more</b> hours before being downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Collier {{was fired}} after the 1961 season and Brown re-hired him as an assistant. Art Modell, {{the owner of the}} Browns, then fired Brown in 1963 and {{promoted}} Collier to head coach. Under Collier, the Browns reached the NFL championship game four times and won once, in 1964. Struggling with hearing loss, Collier retired after the 1970 season, although he remained a scout and quarterbacks coach <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>more</b> years. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1976 and retired to Texas, where he died in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} {{attaining}} its peak intensity, Zeke began to weaken once more due to increasing westerly wind shear. By {{the early morning}} of October30, the center of circulation became devoid of thunderstorm activity and the system had turned eastward. Later that day, Zeke weakened to a tropical depression before degenerating into a remnant low pressure system. The NHC continued to monitor the low-level swirl of clouds associated with Zeke <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>more</b> days as the system meandered several hundred miles south of Baja California Sur.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} {{began on}} 20 November. Radford's force was occupied with air strikes on Japanese ground targets, and faced frequent attack by Japanese aircraft in night combat, which U.S. aircrews were not well prepared or equipped for. He improvised a unit to counter Japanese night raids, {{and was later}} credited with establishing routines for nighttime combat air patrols to protect carriers; these were adopted fleetwide. He commanded Carrier Division Eleven around Tarawa <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>more</b> days, returning to Pearl Harbor on 4 December.|$|E
5|$|Time {{would prove}} Reid correct {{in most of}} his criticisms of Aberhart: he did lack a {{specific}} economic agenda, much of his legislation was struck down by the courts, and the depression did continue <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>more</b> years in Alberta. This was of cold comfort to Reid, whose defeat was total: at 408 days, his time as Premier was the shortest in the province's history to that point.|$|E
5|$|As the {{secondary}} storm began to intensify offshore, precipitation rapidly expanded and tracked northward towards southern Virginia, eastern Maryland and Delaware, {{largely in the}} form of freezing rain, ice, and snow. From 0200 UTC on December 30 to 1200 UTC, the cyclone intensified by 13 mbar, and continued to deepen <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>more</b> hours. Snowfall reached southern New Jersey between 0600 and 0800 UTC, and New York City at around 1000 UTC. Thundersnow developed within heavy bands in some areas. The significant snow was characterized by a sharp western cutoff; for example, in Chester County, accumulations ranged from around 6inches in the far eastern parts of the county to only an inch along its western border with Lancaster County.|$|E

5|$|At its west end, US 50 was {{extended}} south from Sacramento along U.S. Route 99 to Stockton and {{west to the}} San Francisco Bay Area, replacing U.S. Route 48, by the early 1930s. US 50 was officially cut back to Sacramento in the 1964 renumbering, replaced by Interstate 580, but remained on maps and signs <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>more</b> years. US 50 {{was extended}} east from Annapolis to Ocean City, Maryland in 1949, three {{years prior to the}} opening of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1952; this extension replaced Maryland Route 404 between Annapolis and Wye Mills and U.S. Route 213 between Wye Mills and Ocean City. Prior to the bridge opening, US 50 used a ferry across the Chesapeake Bay between Sandy Point and Matapeake and followed present-day Maryland Route 8 between Matapeake and Stevensville before continuing east.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the orbits}} of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge-on from Earth, with Namaka having {{periodically}} occulted Haumea from 2009 to 2011. Observation of such transits would provide precise information on {{the size and shape}} of Haumea and its moons, as happened in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon. The tiny change in brightness of the system during these occultations required at least a medium-aperture professional telescope for detection. Hiʻiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999, a few years before its discovery, and will not do so again for some 130 years. However, in a situation unique among regular satellites, the great torquing of Namaka's orbit by Hiʻiaka preserved the viewing angle of Namaka–Haumea transits <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>more</b> years.|$|E
5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of September8, an eye began to develop within a central dense overcast. Later that day, Fred intensified into a Category 1 hurricane with winds estimated at 75mph (120km/h). By the morning of September9, satellite imagery depicted that Fred had undergone rapid intensification and attained Category 2 status. This resulted from {{the formation of a}} 12mi (19km) wide eye due to low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures. This intensification continued <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>more</b> hours, ending with Fred attaining satellite-estimated its peak intensity as a solid Category 3 hurricane with winds of 120mph (195km/h) and an estimated barometric pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg), making it the second strongest storm of the season.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, US 50 had been {{extended}} to San Francisco via the former US 48 by overlapping US 99 from Sacramento to Stockton and replacing US 48 over Altamont Pass to US 101E (Foothill Boulevard at Castro Valley Boulevard) near Hayward. It was extended over the new Bay Bridge {{at the time of}} its opening in 1936, replacing US 101E on Foothill Boulevard and the present MacArthur Boulevard to the Bay Bridge Distribution Structure in Oakland. As the new MacArthur Freeway (now I-580) was constructed, US 50 was moved to it. This extension was officially eliminated in the 1964 renumbering, but it remained on maps and signs <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>more</b> years before being replaced by I-80 over the Bay Bridge, I-580 over Altamont Pass, I-205 business route through Tracy, I-5 to Stockton, SR 4 (Charter Way) and SR 26 through Stockton, and SR 99 to Sacramento.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{violence}} of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>more</b> years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{would often}} spend {{weekends}} {{with his parents}} in Saskatoon. While there, he began to woo Olive Freeman, daughter of the Baptist minister, but in 1921, she moved with her family to Brandon, Manitoba, and the two lost touch for more than 20 years. He then courted Beth Newell, a cashier in Saskatoon, and by 1922, the two were engaged. However, in 1923, Newell was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and Diefenbaker broke off contact with her. She died the following year. Diefenbaker was himself subject to internal bleeding, and may have feared that the disease would be transmitted to him. In late 1923, he had an operation at the Mayo Clinic for a gastric ulcer, but his health remained uncertain <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>more</b> years.|$|E

5|$|Looking {{to improve}} their on-field product, and also to find a player with talent and star power to better compete with the Jets for New York fans' affections, the Giants {{acquired}} quarterback Fran Tarkenton from the Minnesota Vikings before the 1967 season and showed improvement. They finished 7–7 in both the 1967 and 1968 seasons. In those seasons, one of Tarkenton's favorite targets, wide receiver Homer Jones made the Pro Bowl by amassing over 2,200 yards and 21 touchdowns. The team also upset the division champion Dallas Cowboys 27–21 {{in one of their}} biggest wins in years, and the Giants' jubilant players carried Sherman off the field on their shoulders.
