The main objective of this thesis is to build knowledge on the interaction between the wood material properties and the drying and heat treatment process in terms of material responses. Hopefully, the benefit of the compiled conclusions in this thesis will contribute to the knowledge base on which decisions are made regarding choice of material and control process parameters in order to attain desired quality in end products. The results are summarized as follows: In this study of material properties such as extractive content and its influence on diffusivity, it is shown that density has greater influence than extractive content on diffusivity in pine and spruce. Pine showed lower diffusivity than spruce, but when extractives were removed from pine heartwood, no difference was found in diffusivity compared to pine sapwood or spruce heartwood. The relation between diffusion coefficients in tangential, radial and axial directions in solid pine sapwood was found to be 1 : 1. 8 : 7 respectively. Phenomena within the area of process dynamics were also studied. Calculations of thickness of a thin, dry outer shell formed in pine sapwood boards early in the capillary phase of drying were done based on temperature and mass flux measurements. Comparison with dry shell thickness analysed in a computer tomography scanner showed fairly good agreement and was supported by SEM studies of the dark-coloured shell zone in pine sapwood. The following responses to drying and heat treatment process were studied: strength, sorption/desorption behaviour, dimensional stability, colour changes, capillary water absorption capacity and natural durability. A decrease of shear strength along grain direction was found for high-temperature dried pine i. e. at temperatures exceeding 100 °C, compared to boards dried at lower temperatures. No unambiguous decrease of surface hardness, cleavage strength or toughness was found at the same temperature comparison. Noticeable colour-change responses to heat treatment were found when different wood constituents such as pine and spruce sap and extractives from pine heartwood were heat-treated separately. Colour changes increased with time and temperature. An accelerated colour change was found for pine sap and extractives at temperatures exceeding 70 °C. Computer tomography studies of capillary water absorption in heat-treated and dried pine, spruce and birch showed that heat treatment results in a decreased ability to transport free water in the longitudinal direction in all wood types studied except for pine sapwood. The differences in absorption capacity between spruce sapwood, spruce heartwood and pine heartwood were small. SEM studies of the anatomical microstructure were done with focus on the crossfield pits between horizontal ray parenchyma and longitudinal tracheids in pine and spruce. Crossfield pits in heat-treated and dried pine sapwood were found to be considerably more open than those of not artificially dried sapwood, with partly loose or ruptured membranes. No difference in share of open crossfield pits was found between the material dried at 60 °C and material heat-treated at 170 °C and 200 °C. In pine heartwood, the open, ruptured structures found in heat-treated pine sapwood were rare. A hypothesis involving the emptying of the parenchyma cells has been proposed to explain this observation. The open crossfield structures between ray parenchyma and longitudinal tracheids in dried and heat-treated pine sapwood are believed {{to play an important role}} in explaining the differences in water absorption between pine and spruce sapwood. The impact of drying on the natural durability of pine lumber was studied, with mass loss in a rot test as a measure of durability. Air-dried heartwood showed the best durability compared to kiln-dried at 70 °C, 90 °C and 110 °C. Lowest durability was found when drying was performed at 90 °C with high material temperature early in the capillary regime of drying with high moisture content. The interpretation is that the duration of high material temperature at high moisture content is a critical state for decay resistance in heartwood. Steam conditioning after drying was found to diminish the durability of sapwood. The relation between mass loss in rot test and concentration of total phenolics-compounds known to contribute to the natural durability of pine heartwood-showed a weak negative correlation, as did the relation between mass loss and density. Heating of extractive-rich green sawdust caused a reduction of phenolics with temperature and time. Godkänd; 2008; 20081017 (ysko...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Humidity {{of indoor}} air is an {{important}} factor influencing the air quality and energy con-sumption of buildings as well as durability of building components. Indoor humidity depends on several factors, such as moisture sources, air change, sorption in materials and possible condensation. Since all these phenomena are strongly dependent on each other, numerical predictions of indoor humidity need to be integrated into combined heat and airflow simulation tools. The purpose of a recent international collaborative project, IEA ECBCS Annex 41, has been to advance development in modelling the integral heat, air and moisture transfer processes that take place in “whole buildings” by considering all relevant parts of its constituents. It is believed that full understanding of these processes for the whole building is absolutely crucial for future energy optimization of buildings, as this cannot take place without a coherent and complete description of all <b>hygrothermal</b> <b>processes.</b> This paper will illustrate some of the modelling work that has taken place within the project and present some of the simulation tools used...|$|R
40|$|Building physics {{processes}} {{in some parts}} and elements of revitalized historical buildings {{play an important role}} in their future energy efficiency and maintenance. The unique character of 100 -years-old post-industrial buildings results from masonry-brick façades with precise ornamentation and sophisticated details which should be retained and reconstructed in renovation works. Any changes in wall properties, such as the addition of new layers (insulation, rendering or plaster), are at variance with cultural heritage protection. Therefore, structural and material properties of wall structures and the geometry of external surfaces have to remain unchanged. Heat and moisture transfer across a single-layer masonry wall is discussed. The modeling, numerical solution and climatic, boundary and initial conditions are described. Simulation results of coupled heat, air and moisture in building-envelope systems show the effect of material properties and boundary conditions on water content in the wall. Two cases differing by brickwork mortar (original lime-sand mix and cement mix) are analysed. The influence of the renovation method on heat and mass transfer is examined. The results show overall <b>hygrothermal</b> <b>processes</b> in renovated brick masonry walls. The method of coupled heat and mass transfer is very useful in the prediction of possible damage-related processes and the estimation of rainwater transfer in the wall...|$|R
40|$|Moisture in {{building}} components is mostly attributed to diffusion and condensation of indoor air humidity. Practitioners {{know that the}} Glaserm method is a steady state design tool to avoid interstitial condensation problems. There are, however, other moisture sources like rain water penetration, rising damp and construction moisture which may affect historic and also new buildings. These phenomena cannot be accurately dealt with by the Glaser-diffusion model because they include liquid transport as well as moisture retention. The same holds for transient effects like summer condensation, freeze and thaw cycles, humidity buffering and heat losses by water evaporation which can cause damage or higher energy consumption. In {{order to determine the}} real moisture behavior of building components hygrothermal simulation models have been developed and experimentally validated in recent years. One of the commercially available models widely used in Germany, Eastern Europe and the United States is the PC-program WUFI. The deficiencies of the Glaser-method and the advantages of hygrothermal simulations has been recognized by the CEN committee TC 89. Therefore a new task group was formed in order to overcome the lack of official guidelines for modern simulation tools. Since many manufactures are prepared to have their products tested more thoroughly in order to provide the necessary material data a more wide-spread application of hygrothermal simulations will be feasible in future. In order to convince an increasing number of practitioners to use simulation tools, the user-interface has to become simple and foolproof. This has been the emphasis {{for the development of the}} third version of WUFI which has been available since November 2000. The simulation results help to understand the <b>hygrothermal</b> <b>processes</b> {{in building}} assemblies. However, the interpretation of the results requires practical experience. In order to quantify moisture related effects, such as mold or algae growth, corrosion, frost or salt damage post-process models have to be developed which derive the damage probability from the hygrothermal simulation results...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} hygrothermal aging {{on the free}} volume {{controlled}} diffusion of seawater in the epoxy/glass (E/G) composite samples with E-glass fibers woven at 0 degrees and 45 degrees to the epoxy matrix has been studied using Positron lifetime technique. The equilibrium mass uptake of seawater is assessed by the gravimetric method. The positron {{results indicate that the}} free volume hole size increases with hygrothermal aging in the composite E/G (0 degrees) suggesting swelling while the hole size shows continuous decrease in the E/G (45 degrees) composite up to 45 degrees C. We also found that <b>hygrothermal</b> aging <b>process</b> in the present composites is an exothermic process. Although the equilibrium uptake of seawater decreases with the increasing temperature in both the cases, the magnitude of decrease is more in 0 degrees-oriented composite than in 45 degrees-oriented composite. The heat of absorption calculated from the temperature dependence of equilibrium mass uptake is found to be negative in both the cases...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{membrane}} durability is {{a critical}} issue for proton exchange membrane fuel cell development. Nafion (R) is usually considered as a reference membrane due to its high chemical stability. However, a condensation mechanism of the sullonic groups to fOrM anhydrides was evidenced when Nafioe (R) membranes were stored at 80 degrees C under humid atmospheres. In the present work, Nafion (R) 112 membranes and chemically stabilized Nafion (R) I' NRE 212 C 5 membranes commercialized to replace Nafion (R)) 112 were studied under hygrothermal aging performed at 80 degrees C for two relative humidity conditions: 80 % and 95 %. The impact of the aging conditions was investigated on membrane water and gas transport properties over {{the whole range of}} water activity. For both membrane types, a progressive decrease of the water uptakes was observed as a function of aging time. The <b>hygrothermal</b> aging <b>process</b> was faster for Nafioe 112 membranes than for the chemically stabilized Nalioe' membranes, It became slower as the relative humidity of the aging atmosphere decreased from 95 % to 80 %. A water transport mechanism based on sorption and permeation data was proposed for the aged membranes taking account of the water/polymer interactions and of the progressive crosslinking of the Nation" hydrophilic phase. The gas transport properties were studied for H- 2, O- 2 and CO 2 at different water activities. The decrease of the gas permeability coefficients observed for the aged membranes in comparison with the neat membranes confirmed the presence of gas diffusion pathways within the Nafion (R) hydrophilic phase. The role of these diffusion paths was discussed {{as a function of the}} membrane hydration state, as a function of the aging conditions and of the polarity and size of the diffusing gas molecules...|$|R
