40|$|In the Secchia Valley {{spectacular}} sulphate outcrops (Burano Fm., Upper Triassic) {{are composed}} mostly of gypsum, anhydrite {{is a minor}} constituent. The apparent relative dissolution rates of <b>gypsum</b> and anhydrite <b>rocks</b> are variable and result in peculiar karstic features, which have not been reported in other evaporite deposits. Such differential solution phenomenon can be observed both on the fine scale, along outcrop surfaces, and also at the large scale, controlling drainage patterns of rock masses. These peculiar solution features are the gypsum and anhydrite protrusions and the hypogean bends (“anse ipogee”). Gypsum and anhydrite protrusions. Although anhydrite is less soluble than <b>gypsum,</b> anhydrite-bearing <b>rocks</b> show variable behaviours and may be affected by dissolution {{to a greater extent}} than the <b>gypsum</b> <b>rocks.</b> Fine-grained anhydrite layers and lenses, enclosed in <b>gypsum</b> <b>rocks,</b> protrude from the surrounding gypsum, whereas the coarse-grained anhydrite rocks are more depressed. This effect is due to the presence of gypsified rims on the coarse-grained anhydrite crystals. When running water flushes the <b>rocks,</b> <b>gypsum</b> in the rims dissolves faster than anhydrite. The partially gypsified coarse-grained anhydrite is more deeply attacked because the anhydrite crystals fall away from the rock surface or are carried away by the water as gypsum rims are removed. In layers where gypsification of the anhydrite crystals is negligible, and this is the case for the fine-grained variety, the anhydrite rocks are less attacked and form protrusions relative to the gypsum layers. Hypogean bends (“anse ipogee”). The karstic systems run only at a short distance from the surface, where gypsum is dominant. The expected presence of a larger amount of less soluble anhydrite in the core of the outcrops seems to prevent the development of karstic systems cutting across the sulphate masses. The karstic drainage is concentrated along joints parallel to the valley incisions, following release fractures developed as a consequence of the dramatic drop in internal rock pressure due to rapid valley-floor deepening. Because the Secchia Valley is characterized by small streams, almost orthogonally-oriented with respect to the main valley, the karstic systems may seem to flow uphill where they intercept the joints running parallel to the Secchia valley. This peculiar effect is related to the presence of alluvial and mud-slide deposits, which act as barriers and do not allow the direct down slope resurgence of the karstic waters...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{presence}} <b>gypsum</b> <b>rocks</b> in {{the foundations}} of hydraulic structures cause engineering geo-logical conditions that are difficult and unfavorable for safe construction. Hydrotechnical construction in such soluble rock regions can create conditions of enhanced dissolution and karst development that can threaten the structures. Throughout the world there are examples where the dissolution of gypsum in dam foundations has resulted in tragic consequences. Also this article deals with the pollution problem of the Каmа reservoir during the mining of Polaznenskoe oil deposit. The main factor contributing to the pollution is the intensive karst processes of reservoir banks. Two methods were developed, tested and patented for controlling this pollution. ...|$|R

40|$|Gypsum {{deposits}} are {{the currently}} exploited sulphate rocks with industrial purposes. In {{addition to the}} expensive drilling projects, geophysical techniques can be considered to estimate the economical potential of these deposits. An electrical resistivity tomography survey {{has been carried out}} in the Pira gypsum formation (SE of the Catalan margin of the Tertiary Ebro Basin, Spain). Additionally, a continuous coring drill was performed in order to support the study. Electrical imaging has been successfully applied to identify the gypsum deposits interlayered in lutite units. Nevertheless, the gypsum-lutite boundaries are diffuse and uncertain in the tomographic lines. Comparison of the cores of the borehole and the electrical response shows a meaningful correlation between electrical resistivity and purity of gypsum. The electrical resistivity tomography profiles display a rather wide range of electrical resistivity value (from 20 - 1000 Ωm) for the investigated gypsum facies. The highest values are attributed to sulphate layers with > 90 % of gypsum mineral. Lutite units display higher values than expected due to the presence of evaporite minerals within them (> 10 Ωm). Additionally, induced polarization measures have been performed in order to study the chargeability of gypsum deposits. It has been evidenced that impure <b>gypsum</b> <b>rocks</b> (with important presence of lutites within) are slightly chargeable. This property has allowed distinguishing between lutite levels and clay-rich <b>gypsum</b> <b>rocks.</b> Electrical resistivity tomography lines are useful in the prospection of gypsum deposits.

40|$|Karst paleo-{{collapse}}s {{are unique}} collapse structures widely {{found in the}} coal measures of northern China.

Over the last 40 years, water inrushes through these collapses have caused fatalities, economic losses, and degradation in the environment in northern China. Determination of locations and hydrogeological characteristics of the karst paleo-collapses are essential in preventing water inrush incidents through them.

40|$|The Southern Imera river crosses one of {{the most}} arid part of Sicily. The geochemical {{composition}} of the river wa-ter is due to the solubilization processes of <b>gypsum</b> <b>rocks,</b> which accounts for the particularly low quality of re-sources in the areas in which the presence of evaporitics deposits is highest. The geochemical composition and hydraulic parameters of river was monitored with the aim of reaching {{a better understanding of the}} relationships between litology and water quality. The Imera river is a potential local hydric resource, but seasonal variability of salinity does not allow farmers to use its water. A geochemical monitoring of the Imera river water has been carried out in selected localities integrating a GIS analysis of the river hydrogra-phy basin and of the distribution of the evaporitic formation. During 2003 and 2005 we performed four monitor-ing surveys of water chemicophysical parameters (temperature, pH and electrical conductivity) and of the main ion-ic concentrations (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K+, Na+, Cl-, SO 4 2 -). We also installed a multiparameter probe next to the hydromet-rical station of Drasi, about 15 km from the river mouth. Such multiparameter probe was used to determine, con-tinuously and simultaneously, temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, redox potenzial, water level. The geochemical composition of the water allowed to confirm the results of Roda (1971) and Favara (2000), who pointed out that the main cause of degrade of the Southern Imera river are the salt-rich waters of some tributaries flowing over <b>gypsum</b> <b>rocks</b> and halite deposits.

40|$|The Burano Evaporite Formation {{from the}} Secchia River Valley is an up to 2200 m-thick {{sequence}} composed of meter-to decameter-scale interbeds of gypsum-anhydrite and dolostones with minor halite. The deposit has {{been affected by}} a complex array of post-depositional modifications, thermal events and large-scale evaporite dissolution, preventing a satisfactory reconstruction of the environment of deposition. The modifications are intense because these rocks were the main decollement horizon during {{the formation of the}} Northern Apennines chain. The carbonate rocks are massive and-or laminated dolomitic mudstone, wackestone, oolitic packstones and oolitic, peloidal, bioclastic grainstones, which commonly appear as mega-boudins within a sulfate groundmass. The dolostones (delta O- 18 = - 5. 7 to - 3. 7 parts per thousand; delta C- 13 = + 1. 3 to + 3. 0 parts per thousand; PDB) have been affected by Mg-metasomatic replacement by magnesite (delta O- 18 = - 14. 0 to - 2. 6 parts per thousand; delta C- 13 = - 2. 6 to + 1. 4 parts per thousand; PDB) induced by hydrothermal circulation. Total homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions in hydrothermal magnesite range from 275 to 310 degreesC. The anhydrite rocks are characterized by flow structures such as centimeter-scale pseudo-lamination composed of aligned prismatic crystals with transposed isoclinal folds outlined by dolostones fragments. Homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions in authigenic quartz incorporated into sulfate rocks range from 260 to 305 degreesC (Emilia) and from 230 to 315 degreesC (Tuscany). The <b>gypsum</b> <b>rocks</b> are composed of xenotopic irregular cloudy crystals and, more rarely, by centimeter-scale idiotopic crystals showing the same structures as the anhydrite rocks. The origin of the <b>gypsum</b> <b>rocks</b> is due to late alteration of anhydrite by migration of sharp hydration fronts. The hydration is a two step process and is revealed by the presence in the <b>gypsum</b> <b>rocks</b> of corroded anhydrite micro-relies and authigenic quartz crystals which include anhydrite. The role of the Burano Evaporites during the Apennines tectogenesis can be depicted as follows: (a) prevalent deposition of gypsum in the Upper Triassic; (b) gypsum dehydration at burial conditions to form anhydrite (Cretaceous?); (c) syn-tectonic flow of anhydrite rocks, brecciation of dolostones; syn-tectonic growth stage of quartz euhedra at deep burial conditions possibly related {{to the development of the}} Oligocene-Miocene greenschist facies Apuane metamorphic complex; (d) hydrothermal deposition of sparry magnesite and partial Mg-metasomatic replacement of dolostones by magnesite; (e) sub-surface dissolution of halite to form thick matrix-supported residual caprock-like anhydrite mega-breccias; (f) complete gypsification of anhydrite at sub-surface conditions; and (g) evaporite dissolution at surface exposure producing dolostone breccias with partial calcitization and removal of most clasts (Calcare cavernoso).
