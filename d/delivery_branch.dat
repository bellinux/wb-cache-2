40|$|Aim: To {{develop a}} new {{synthetic}} peptide-based nanoparticulate siRNA delivery system. Materials & methods: DEN-K(GALA) -TAT-K(STR) was generated by incorporating stearic acid into a multicomponent peptide (DEN-K(GALA) -TAT), containing a cationic poly-L-lysine dendron, an endosome-disrupting peptide GALA and a cell-penetrating peptide TAT(48 - 60). Its physicochemical characteristics, size, toxicity, cellular uptake and gene knockdown activity of the peptide/siRNA complexes were studied. Results: DEN-K(GALA) -TAT-K(STR) exhibited a pH-responsive behavior, which assists with endosomal escape. When siRNA was delivered by DEN-K(GALA) -TAT-K(STR), it showed a significantly enhanced cellular uptake, compared with the nonlipidic peptide.

40|$|Major {{restrictions}} to {{the hydraulic}} conductance of xylem (KXYL) in vascular plants {{have traditionally been}} attributed to anatomical constraints.

Furthermore, the ionic effect has been suggested to play functional roles in planta with respect to: (i) phloem-mediated control of xylem hydraulic properties, (ii) compensation of cavitation-induced loss of hydraulic conductance, with the result of optimizing light and water utilization, and (iii) differential regulation of water <b>delivery</b> to <b>branches</b> exposed to different levels of light.

We find that customer adoption of online banking is associated with (1) substitution, primarily from incrementally more costly self-service delivery channels (automated teller machine and voice response unit); (2) augmentation of service consumption in more costly service <b>delivery</b> channels (<b>branch</b> and call center); (3) a substantial increase in total transaction volume; (4) an increase in estimated average cost to serve resulting from the combination of points (1) -(3); and (5) a reduction in short-term customer profitability. However, we find that use of the online banking channel is associated with higher customer retention rates over one-, two-, and three-year horizons. The documented relationship between the use of online banking and customer retention remains positive even after controlling for self-selection into the online channel. We also find evidence that future market shares for our sample firm are systematically higher in markets with high contemporaneous utilization rates for the online banking channel. This finding holds even after controlling for contemporaneous market share, suggesting it is not simply the result of increased market power leading to the acquisition of online banking customers. service operations, self service, online banking, customer profitability, cost to serve...|$|R

The reservoir, referred to as Lake Wallula, was formed in April, 1953, with {{the closure of the}} McNary Dam on the Columbia River. Sediments eroded from the basin were deposited in the reservoir in subsequent years. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers performed eight reservoir branch capacity surveys from 1953 to 1965 to determine net deposition of sediment. Basin hydroclimate data that is available for this study include: (1) precipitation, (2) river discharge, and (3) temperature and snowfall data. The objective of this thesis is to assess the impact that the Walla Walla Basin’s seasonal and inter-annual hydroclimate has on sediment delivery to the Walla Walla Branch of Lake Wallula. Specifically, this is done by: (1) identifying the best hydroclimatic indicators of sediment delivery, (2) creating a sediment delivery model, (3) assessing the significance of hydroclimate variability, and (4) performing an event analysis. The topography within the basin presents additional challenges due to the impact o f varying climate conditions at different elevations.

The semiconducting nature and the size-dependent fluorescence of these nanocrystals have made them very attractive for diagnosis of diseases. Gene-associated drugs can be loaded within a QD core or attached {{to the surface of}} these nanoparticles through direct conjugation or electrostatic complexation by which QDs can protect the gene from degradation by nucleases [65 – 67]. Super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONS) are utilized as gene delivery systems. In pulmonary gene <b>delivery</b> systems, either <b>branched</b> biodegradable polyesters or PEG-coated super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are promising carriers. These nanoparticles can maintain their transfection ability at in vivo condition after nebulization [68, 69]. However, there are challenges, such as the standardization of therapy response and the stability of complex nanoparticles under certain biological conditions. SPION are known to be an excellent carrier for siRNA delivery because they are biocompatible and target-functionalized. In spite of hard-to-transfect cell lines, the novel method such as magnetofection can be used for delivering of SPION with plasmid DNA or siRNA, where these nanoparticles is subjected to oscillating magnetic fields that facilitate caveolae-mediated endocytosis of SPION and cargo nucleic acid [70]. Due to nano-dimension size and also stability, inorganic nanoparticles are being extensively used as promising gene carriers. All of reviewed studies signify that inorganic nanoparticles such as gold and silica possess attractive properties such as high fictionalization ability, good biocompatibility, low toxicity, and potential capability of targeted delivery [71]. Also, it seems that functionalized CNTs according to their large inner volume (that allows the loading of small biomolecules), quantum dots because of their unique luminescent properties, Calcium phosphate nanoparticles due to wide availability and high safety, and lately, SPIONs owing to their valuable magnetic properties are appropriate candidates as carriers for gene transfection.|$|R

It is also anticipated that technology-supported approaches can improve the efficacy of curriculum approval processes at universities, thereby increasing the curriculum responsiveness of institutions and supporting improved and rapid review mechanisms which may support enhancements to pedagogy [2]. Responsive curriculum design and approval, and the rapid generation of curricula that this infers, is increasingly necessary to respond to changing academic contexts and the changing needs of stakeholders (e. g. employers, professional bodies, etc.) [3], [4]. The emerging globalized university sector [5], [6] also contributes to these pressures by frequently necessitating the creation of specialist curricula, either to attract international students or to render curricula conducive to <b>delivery</b> at international <b>branch</b> campuses [7]. As part of the JISC 5 / 08 Institutional Approaches to Curriculum Design Programme [8], the Principles in Patterns (PiP) Project ([URL] investigated and developed a technology-supported approach to curriculum design and approval. PiP Project investigation and development activity ended in August 2012. Attention has now turned to the embedding phase of the Project (August 2012 – April 2013). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to document a suitable embedding strategy and plan for successfully implementing C-CAP across the University of Strathclyde. This plan is informed by the systems and technology implementation literature and also includes and timetables significant outstanding work or actions arising from the PiP Final Evaluation Report (WP 7 : 40 Project evaluation synthesis) [9]. Internal discussions within the C-CAP team have also informed the key tenets of the embedding plan (Appendix B) ...|$|R
