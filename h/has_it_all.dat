2500|$|The years 560 and 561 {{correspond}} roughly to the annos Domini 1165 and 1166, {{but here}} Ibn Ṣāḥib {{is almost certainly}} off in his dating by a year. The events rather took place in 1164 and 1165. A later Portuguese chronicle, the Crónica dos Godos ("Chronicle of the Goths"), dates the conquest of Évora to the year 1204 of the Spanish era, that is, 1166. Trujillo was taken on 14 May 1164, or in June; Évora in September 1164; and Cáceres in December 1164 or, on a later dating, in September 1166. These were the major conquests. The lesser conquests of Montánchez, Serpa, and Juromenha took place in 1165, based on Ibn Ṣāḥib's scheme, but Montánchez and Serpa may have gone in March 1167, as one historian <b>has</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> the primary sources agree that Santa Cruz de la Sierra {{was the last of}} Gerald's successes, which may place it as late as 1169, though perhaps earlier (1167/8), along with Ureña. The conquest of these last two places left Gerald in a position to harass Beja. The date of the capture of Monfragüe, which was certainly one of his conquests, cannot be established.|$|E
2500|$|Bayern did not {{contest the}} Belmont Stakes and was instead {{aimed at the}} seven-furlong Woody Stephens Stakes at the same meeting. He contested the early lead before taking a clear {{advantage}} entering the straight and drew away in the closing stages to win by {{seven and a half}} lengths from Top Fortitude. His winning time of 1:20.75 was less than a second off the track record. [...] Stevens returned as his jockey and said, [...] "That was a powerhouse performance. He had a bad experience in the gate in the Preakness. Jimmy Barnes [...] and Bob's crew did a great job getting him ready by schooling, schooling, schooling him." [...] Bayern was moved back up in class and distance for the Grade I Haskell Invitational over nine furlongs at Monmouth Park on July 27. Ridden for the first time by Martin Garcia, he was the second choice in the betting behind the filly Untapable. Garcia took the lead from the start and set a steady pace before drawing away in the straight to win by more than seven lengths from Albano, with Untapable in fifth place. Baffert, who won the race for a record seventh time, watched the running on television. After the race, the trainer, who said that he had considered keeping the horse to sprint distances, stated, [...] "We tried to slow him down in the past, but now we know we just have to utilize his speed. I didn't think he'd do it as devastating as that. It looks like he <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> together now." ...|$|E
2500|$|The New York critics' {{reviews of}} the {{original}} production were mixed to positive. A 1993 New York Times review commented that the musical [...] "has grown in stature over the years, primarily because of its superb score.... combined a lyrical simplicity with a lush romanticism, beautifully captured in numbers like 'I Loved You Once in Silence' and 'If Ever I Would Leave You.' These ballads sung by Guenevere and Lancelot {{are among the most}} memorable in the Lerner-Loewe catalogue. King Arthur supplies the wit, with songs like 'I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight.'" [...] A 2003 review noted, [...] "this musically rich, legend-based classic evokes enough swashbuckling spectacle to keep one smiling. And for lovers of dime-store romance, Camelot <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> – a beautiful English princess swept off her feet by a shy, but passionate bachelor king; an ardent French knight, torn between devotion to his liege and an uncontrollable hunger, reciprocated, to be sure, for the king's tempestuous wife.... Camelot features a score rich in English country-tune charm by Mr. Lerner. [...] Its lyrics, by Mr. Loewe , never fail to dazzle with their virtuosity and wit." [...] However, [...] "Jay Lerner's murky book... has helped sink many a revival of the musical.... It's a good story, but Lerner's book is talky and dense, filled with pontificating soliloquies that would have been more powerfully contained in song. Moreover, while the entire show rushes towards a bloody climax... when it finally arrives, it is merely sketched upon in one song, [...] "Guinevere." ...The score, though, is pure magic" ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{preview of}} the PlayStation version in Next Generation called it [...] "one of the best PC {{strategy}} games ever". According to a 1996 review by GameSpot, [...] "put simply, X-COM is a bona fide modern classic, standing proudly alongside Civilization and Populous as a benchmark {{in the evolution of}} strategy gaming." [...] A 1996 review of the PlayStation version by Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that [...] "any person who likes strategy games will fall in love with this title" [...] and added that [...] "if you could afford to buy one game for the PS over the next year, X-COM would be it. It <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> and then some!" [...] A reviewer for Next Generation criticized the PlayStation version for being little more than a straight port, arguing that the game could have been improved if the console's capabilities were used. However, he praised the game itself for its sophisticated, enjoyable gameplay, and concluded, [...] "X-Com was a smashing PC title, it's lost nothing of practical value in the translation, and makes a marvelous addition to the console market." [...] A rare dissenting review by GamePro stated that [...] "You have to be a major sim-freak to enjoy X-Com. It's an interesting and complex game about planet colonizing, but the extensive manuals and one-dimensional music really bore you to alien tears after a while." [...] Computer Gaming World gave it its Game of the Year award for 1994. PC Gamer US presented Enemy Unknown with its 1994 [...] "Best Strategy Game" [...] award. The editors wrote, [...] "X-COMs classic mix of action and strategy will have you hooked for hours, and made this one of the finest games of the year." ...|$|E
