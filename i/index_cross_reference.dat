40|$|The NASA Aerospace Safety Information System, is an interactive, {{generalized}} {{data base}} management system. The on-line retrieval aspects provide for operating {{from a variety}} of terminals (or in batch mode). NASIS retrieval enables the user to expand and display (review) the terms of <b>index</b> (<b>cross</b> <b>reference)</b> files, select desired index terms, combine sets of documents corresponding to selected terms and display the resulting records. It also allows the user to print (record) this information on a high speed printer if desired. NASIS also provides the ability to store the strategy of any given session the user has executed. It has a searching and publication ability through generalized linear search and report generating modules which may be performed interactively or in a batch mode. The user may specify formats for the terminal from which he is operating. The system features an interactive user's guide which explains the various commands available and how to use them as well as explanations for all system messages. This explain capability may be extended, without program changes, to include descriptions of the various files in use. Coupled with the ability of NASIS to run in an MTT (multi-terminal task) mode is its automatic accumulation of statistics on each user of the system as well as each file...|$|E

There have historically been two main methods of organizing printed encyclopedias: the alphabetical method (consisting {{of a number of}} separate articles, organized in alphabetical order) and organization by hierarchical categories. The former method is today the more common, especially for general works. The fluidity of electronic media, however, allows new possibilities for multiple methods of organization of the same content. Further, electronic media offer new capabilities for search, <b>indexing</b> and <b>cross</b> <b>reference.</b> The epigraph from Horace on the title page of the 18th century Encyclopédie suggests the importance of the structure of an encyclopedia: [...] "What grace may be added to commonplace matters by the power of order and connection." ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} fully {{automatic}} method for summarizing and indexing unstructured presentation videos based on text {{extracted from the}} projected slides. We use changes of text in the slides {{as a means to}} segment the video into semantic shots. Unlike precedent approaches, our method does not depend on availability of the electronic source of the slides, but rather extracts and recognizes the text directly from the video. Once text regions are detected within keyframes, a novel binarization algorithm, Local Adaptive Otsu (LOA), is employed to deal with the low quality of video scene text, before feeding the re-gions to the open source Tesseract 1 OCR engine for recognition. We tested our system on a corpus of 8 presentation videos for a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes, achieving 0. 5343 Precision and 0. 7446 Recall Character recognition rates, and 0. 4947 Precision and 0. 6651 Recall Word recognition rates.

40|$|Maps are beguilingly simple {{structures}} {{with deep}} and ubiquitous properties. They arise in an essential way {{in many areas}} of mathematics and mathematical physics, but require considerable time and computational effort to generate. Few collected drawings are available for reference, and little has been written, in book form, about their enumerative aspects. An Atlas of the Smaller Maps in Orientable and Nonorientable Surfaces is the first book to provide complete collections of maps along with their vertex and face partitions, number of rootings, and an <b>index</b> number for <b>cross</b> <b>referencing.</b> It provides an explanation of axiomatization and encoding, and serves as an introduction to maps as a combinatorial structure. The Atlas lists the maps first by genus and number of edges, and gives the embeddings of all graphs with at most five edges in orientable surfaces, thus presenting the genus distribution for each graph. Exemplifying the use of the Atlas, the authors explore two substantial conjectures with origins in mathematical physics and geometry: the Quadrangulation Conjecture and the b-Conjecture. The authors'' clear, readable exposition and overview of enumerative theory makes this collection accessible even to professionals who are not specialists. For researchers and students working with maps, the Atlas provides a ready source of data for testing conjectures and exploring the algorithmic and algebraic properties of maps...|$|R

6000|$|This is by {{no means}} an {{impossible}} demand. The total population of the world is, on the most generous estimate, not more than 1,500,000,000, and the effectual indexing of this number of people, the record of their movement hither and thither, the entry of various material facts, such as marriage, parentage, criminal convictions and the like, the entry of the new-born and the elimination of the dead, colossal task though it would be, is still not so great as to be immeasurably beyond comparison with the work of the post-offices in the world of to-day, or the cataloguing of such libraries as that of the British Museum, or such collections as that of the insects in Cromwell Road. Such an index could be housed quite comfortably on one side of Northumberland Avenue, for example. It is only a reasonable tribute to the distinctive lucidity of the French mind to suppose the central index housed in a vast series of buildings at or near Paris. The index would be classified primarily by some unchanging physical characteristic, such as we are told the thumb-mark and finger-mark afford, and to these would be added any other physical traits that were of material value. The classification of thumb-marks and of inalterable physical characteristics goes on steadily, and there is every reason for assuming it possible that each human being could be given a distinct formula, a number or [...] "scientific name," [...] under which he or she could be docketed. [Footnote: It is quite possible that the actual thumb-mark may play only a small part in the work of identification, but it is an obvious convenience to our thread of story to assume that it is the one sufficient feature.] About the buildings in which this great main index would be gathered, would be a system of other <b>indices</b> with <b>cross</b> <b>references</b> to the main one, arranged under names, under professional qualifications, under diseases, crimes and the like.|$|R
