Water absorption, density, strength, hardness, fracture toughness, thermal expansion coefficient of the fired bodies were measured; XRD and SEM images were also examined. The fired samples were finally tested in acidic environment in order to evaluate their elution behaviour and consequently their environmental compatibility. It is observed that, although the shrinkage on firing is too high for the production of tiles, in all the compositions studied the sintering procedure leads to fine microstructures, good mechanical properties and to a limitation of the release of many of the most hazardous metals contained in the starting powder...|$|E

40|$|The {{vitrification}} {{treatment has}} been successfully exploited as a solution for the disposal of polluted <b>dredging</b> <b>spoils</b> from the industrial area close to the Venice Lagoon. The addition of 20 % by wt. of glass cullet to the calcined sediments in the vitrification batch provides a suitable chemical composition for the obtainment of an inert glass, despite the compositional variations of the sediments. The obtained waste glass, after being finely ground, has been employed (i) as a raw material for the manufacture of sintered glass-ceramics, by cold pressing and single-step sintering at about 940 °C, and (ii) as sintering additive (the maximum addition being 10 % by wt.) for the manufacture of traditional red single firing ceramic tiles, with a maximum firing temperature of 1186 °C. Both applications {{have proved to be}} promising: in the first case, the sintered glass ceramic product exhibits notable mechanical properties (bending strength > 130 MPa, HV≈ 6. 5 GPa); in the second case, the addition of waste glass does not modify substantially the investigated physical and mechanical properties of the traditional product (water absorption, linear shrinkage, bending strength, planarity) ...|$|E

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (M. S.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1977. Bibliography: leaves 140 - 145. A {{comparison}} of a 1976 bathymetric survey of Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii, {{with that of}} a 1927 survey indicates that there has been an average shoaling of the lagoonal area by 3. 3 feet. Shoaling for the north and middle bay at 1. 4 ft/ 49 years is at a considerably lower rate than for the south bay at 5. 2 ft/ 49 years. Sedimentological studies, based on dredging history and detailed chemical, mineralogical and grain-size analyses of 251 bottom samples, suggest that the total volume of fill into the bay during the 49 year period is approximately 25, 500, 000 cubic yards. Of this amount, approximately 63 % is carbonate detritus from the barrier, fringing, and patch reefs {{as well as by the}} living corals, 11 % is <b>dredging</b> <b>spoils,</b> and the remaining 27 % is attributed to terrigenous detritus. The terrigenous fraction, contributed primarily by stream loading and sheet-wash, brings approximately 69, 300 tons of sediment to the lagoon per year. Seismic reflection profiles, which span the length of the bay and include additional lines in the south bay, show that most of the infilling material is unconsolidated sediment trapped between and burying coralline structures built during ancient, lower stands of the sea. All information suggests that shoaling rates within the bay have increased since 1927 due to higher stream loads from increased urbanization as well as to extensive dredging and disposal operations. This is particularly evident in the area of the south bay...|$|E
40|$|Long term {{sustainability}} in {{salt marsh}} and mangroves {{is dependent on}} dominant species, such as Spartina alterniflora, to capture organic and inorganic sediment. The research analyzes that sustainability. This work demonstrates the prediction of hydrodynamics and biomass density of salt marsh to provide useful information for the planning and mitigation of sea-level rise impacts on marsh sustainability in the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve (GTMNERR), Florida. An advanced circulation code was applied to simulate hydrodynamics (i. e., shallow water equations) in the GTMNERR. The model used a set of parameters and conditions based on the GTMNERR domain to predict tides for present-day conditions, which was validated using tidal data from eight monitoring stations within the GTMNERR. The hydrodynamic model results (i. e., MLW and MHW) were then coupled with a marsh equilibrium model to assess year-to-year biomass density for saltmarsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Vegetative data {{were obtained from the}} staff of the GTMNERR and organized for future work towards validation of biomass density predictions. Simulations were then performed with sea-level rise scenarios of 0. 13 m, 0. 22 m and 0. 51 m, which are standardized cases of mild, moderate, and extreme rise for the northeast coast of Florida. The simulation results show nonlinear increase of tidal datums for given sea-level rise, thus leading to nonlinear change in biomass productivity. The modeling tool has engineering implications in the way of assisting the planning of <b>dredging</b> <b>spoils</b> to be laid over the marsh to sustain existing marsh against rising sea levels. The modeling tool further provides information about marsh migration due to sea-level rise, whereby coastal planners can use this information to designate and preserve existing uplands/wetlands that will house salt marsh in the future, as the marshes will migrate into such upland/wetlands areas...|$|E

40|$|The {{disposal}} of <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park for port expansion at Abbot Point in North Queensland, Australia, {{has been a}} contentious issue receiving extensive media coverage.

This paper identifies different perceptions of risk portrayed by local, regional, interstate and national print media in relation to the <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> issue from January 2013 until February 2014. Media analysis explored the questions: how is 'risk' represented, who is linked to different risk perceptions, and how has the media coverage of the issue changed over time?

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{policy in}} the Netherlands {{concerning}} waste recognises an order of preference, with prevention as the ideal solution, followed by reuse (either direct or after treatment) and confined disposal as the least preferred option. The reuse of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> is the cheapest removal option {{and one that is}} frequently used. Treatment of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> is more expensive than disposal and hence difficult to stimulate. Consequently, 2002 saw the introduction of a tax of € 13. 48 per ton on the disposal of treatable <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils.</b> The environmental objective was to cancel out the economic advantage of disposal over processing and thus to encourage treatment. The introduction of this tax measure has had a number of positive effects:- In-situ sediment site investigations have been extended to include the determination of the sand content, and more attention is being paid to identifying sandy and non-sandy batches;- More accurate records of the dredging, transportation and disposal processes are being drawn up;- Treatment is being carried out under a quality assurance system geared towards maximising sand production...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{laboratory}} scale study {{was carried out}} using Starkey medium to demonstrate the feasibility of using microbial methods for the bioleaching of heavy metals from contaminated spoils. Acidophilic bacteria, Acidithiobacillus species were isolated from abandoned <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> that were produced during the dredging of oil well access canals in the Niger Delta. Two different composite <b>dredged</b> <b>spoil</b> samples were collected, suspended in Starkey medium and inoculated with {{the culture of the}} bacteria for 1 - 7 weeks. The heavy metal concentration of the sediment prior to the bioleaching are as follows: copper (121. 1 ± 0. 30 mg/kg), cadmium (130. 8 ± 0. 53 mg/kg), chromium (143 ± 1. 00 mg/kg), nickel (138. 5 ± 0. 36 mg/kg), manganese (296 ± 2. 00 mg/kg) and zinc (131. 5 ± 0. 50 mg/kg). During the leaching process, the results of the physico-chemical monitoring show that pH decreased from 3. 5 to < 2. 0, while sulphate, conductivity, redox potential, turbidity, iron and optical density of the leaching broth increased. The physical observations (colour, turbidity, slime production, utilization of sulphur crystals) correlated with the physico-chemical measurements. After seven weeks of bioleaching, the heavy metal recoveries from the spoil 1 are copper (89 %), cadmium (100 %), chromium (56 %), nickel (81 %), manganese (68 %) and lead (96 %).
