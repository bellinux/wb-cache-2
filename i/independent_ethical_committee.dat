40|$|Background Current {{guidelines}} for opioid dependence recommend daily maintenance of physical dependence with methadone or buprenorphine, and discourage abstinence {{due to the}} high risk of relapse and overdose. Extended-release formulations of the opioid antagonist naltrexone (XR-NTX) block heroin and other opioid agonists competitively for around 4 weeks per administration. XR-NTX thus enables opioid users to experience abstinence from opioid agonists with greatly reduced risk of overdose compared to medication-free abstinence. While XR-NTX has shown promise compared to placebo and daily naltrexone tablets, there is limited information on long-term safety and its performance compared to daily maintenance treatment. Methods/Design In this five-hospital RCT with long-term follow-up, we aim to recruit n[*]=[*] 180 patients in treatment for opioid dependence and allocate them in an open, randomized manner (1 : 1) to receive either 4 -week XR-NTX or daily buprenorphine-naloxone (BP-NLX) {{for the duration of}} 12  weeks. Allocation is open-label due to the risk of overdose during attempts to self-unmask allocation using heroin. Urine drug tests are scheduled every week with follow-up visits & assessment every 4 weeks. Primary outcomes are abstinence from illicit opioids in urine drug tests and self-report, as well as retention in treatment. Secondary outcomes include other substance use, injecting behavior, drug craving, mental health, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, abstinence motivation, opioid agonist effect rating, insomnia, and pain. Observation is continued for another 36  weeks in order to assess longer-term safety, adherence and effectiveness. The study is an investigator-initiated trial, funded by public grants and approved by an <b>Independent</b> <b>Ethical</b> <b>Committee</b> (the Regional Ethical Committee for Research South-East B # 2011 / 1320) and the Norwegian Medicines Agency. Discussion Despite minor implementation problems, the protocol appears sufficiently robust to generate results of high interest to patients, clinicians and policy makers.

40|$|Extract] On 12 June 2009, two Gold Coast radio hosts {{attached}} 200 helium balloons to a live piglet for {{the purpose}} of seeing whether a pig could fly. The broadcast stunt was a play on words {{at the time of the}} swine flu (flew?) outbreak. Despite the constant squeals of the piglet and what one may think is the questionable logic of bothering with such an endeavour, this stunt was found not to breach Australian law. The investigation into the piglet broadcast did not lead to a decided case in Australian law courts. Rather, the details of the investigation are administrative and found in a report of the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). That investigation examined the complaint of this author under cll 1. 3 (a) and 1. 5 (a) of the Commercial Radio Australia Codes of Practice and Guidelines 2004, namely that the broadcast would incite, encourage or present violence or brutality for its own sake and offend contemporary standards of decency. Significantly, from a legal perspective, the use of the words "violence" and "brutality" were said to have set a high legal standard, such that the broadcast did not offend the Code of Practice. This is despite the fact that evidence from the RSPCA stated that: "if the stunt had continued for any further length of time I am sure a breach (of the Animal Care and Protection Act 2001) would have occurred". This case note argues that there needs to be a reform and strengthening of Animal law in Australia. In particular, there needs to be a redrafting of the Commercial Radio Australia Codes of Practice and Guidelines to include prohibition of treatment of animals which is cruel or inappropriate as well as that which incites violence and brutality. Further, the case raises the issue of whether there should be an <b>independent</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>committee</b> to adjudge the use of animals in the media. In the view of the author, there should be...|$|E
40|$|Objetivos: Estudiar en población penitenciaria la concordancia de la prueba de la tuberculina (PT) y las pruebas de interferón gamma (IFG). Material y métodos: Estudio prospectivo realizado en una prisión en mayo-junio de 2009. Se estudian los ingresos sin antecedente de {{tuberculosis}} (TB) o con PT previa negativa o no realizada. Se realizó IDR de Mantoux (positivo ³ 10 mm) y extracción sanguínea para prueba de IFG (QuantiFERON®-TB Gold). En los infectados, se realizó despistaje de TB. Se pasó un cuestionario y se solicitó consentimiento informado. El estudio fue aprobado por un Comité ético ajeno a instituciones penitenciarias. La concordancia entre PT e IFG se basó en el índice Kappa. Resultados: Se incluyeron 181 casos. El 62 % eran extranjeros, el 17 % vacunados por BCG, el 8, 4 % UDI y el 4 % VIH+. En los extranjeros había más vacunados, menos UDI y menos infectados por VIH que en autóctonos (p= 0, 02, p= 0, 02, y p= 0, 01, respectivamente). La PT fue positiva en el 24 % y la IFG en el 26 %. Hubo información de ambas en 149 (82 %) casos. El 15, 8 % fueron discordantes. El índice Kappa fue de 0, 6 (0, 4 - 0, 7). La concordancia varió según subgrupos, siendo mayor en autóctonos (kappa= 0, 8) y menor en vacunados (kappa= 0, 4) e inmigrantes (kappa= 0, 5). Conclusión: La concordancia global fue moderada-buena, pero en vacunados e inmigrantes fue menor. El nivel de discordancia aconseja ampliar el estudio, así como evaluar que prueba predice mejor el riesgo de progresión a TB y el coste-beneficio de ambas en la población reclusa de nuestro país. Objective: To {{study the}} agreement of Tuberculin Skin Tests (TST) and Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRA) when screening tuberculosis infection amongst inmates recently admitted to prison. Materials and methods: Prospective study conducted in a prison during the months of May and June 2009. Inmates without a TB history, with previous TST negatives or without prior TSTs were included. Participants signed an informed consent form and the study was approved by an <b>independent</b> <b>Ethical</b> <b>Committee.</b> TST (positive 10 > or = mm) and IGRA (Quantiferon TB-Gold) were performed and standardized data collection was carried out. The agreement between both tests was analysed using the Kappa index. Results: A total of 181 people were included. 62 % were foreign-born, 17 % had previous BCG vaccination, 8. 4 % were IDUs and 4 % HIV-infected. Foreign born subjects were more frequently vaccinated and presented less drug use and HIV infection than people born in Spain. (p= 0. 02, p= 0. 02 and p= 0. 01 respectively). TST results were positive in 24 % and IGRA in 26 %. Both tests were performed in 149 people (82 %). Discordant results were observed in 15. 8 %. Agreement of the Kappa coefficient was 0. 6 (CI 0. 4 - 0. 7). Agreement was better in the native population (K= 0. 8) and worse in BCG vaccinated (K= 0. 4) and foreign-born subjects (K= 0. 8). Conclusion: Overall agreement was moderate and was less amongst vaccinated subjects and those born abroad. Extension of the study could be useful to evaluate which test better predicts the risk of progression to active TB and the cost-benefit of both tests among the prison population...|$|E
