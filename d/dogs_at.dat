5|$|Since {{opening in}} 1962, the zoo {{has focused on}} animal {{conservation}} efforts. Programs at the Phoenix Zoo include captive breeding for reintroduction (for instance the Arabian oryx, black-footed ferret, Mexican wolf, Ramsey Canyon leopard frog, and thick-billed parrot, sanctuary for animals that are no longer breeding (for instance the African painted <b>dogs</b> <b>at</b> the zoo), and rescue and rehabilitation (for instance lead poisoning treatments for the California condor).|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{government}} did not raise the Homeland Security Advisory System terrorist threat level, orange at the time (high risk of terrorist attacks), following the attack. The Department of Homeland Security said that additional security measures would be {{in place for the}} remainder of the Christmas travel period. The TSA detailed several of the measures, including a restriction on movement and access to personal items during the last hour of flight for planes entering U.S. airspace. The TSA also said that there would be more officers and security <b>dogs</b> <b>at</b> airports.|$|E

5|$|In July 2012 it was {{reported}} that police have been given the power to issue £50 on-the-spot fines for littering, cycling outside designated areas and for dog fouling offences. In August 2012 a dog owner was ordered to pay £315 after allowing five dogs to chase ducks in the park. Since 2013 commercial dog-walkers have been required to apply for licences to walk dogs in the park and are allowed to walk only four <b>dogs</b> <b>at</b> a time. In September 2013 a cyclist was successfully prosecuted for speeding at 37mph in the park. In March 2015 a cycling club member was fined for speeding at 41mph and faced disciplinary action from his cycling club, which uses the park for training. In 2014 and 2015 two men were prosecuted for picking mushrooms in the park.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas {{will follow}} packs of African wild dogs {{in order to}} {{appropriate}} their kills. They will typically inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching wild <b>dogs</b> <b>at</b> a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off {{with a piece of}} meat unnoticed, though they may be mobbed by the dogs in the attempt. When operating in groups, spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas, who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, {{the relationship between the two}} species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas, with wild dog densities being negatively correlated with high hyena populations.|$|E
5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) {{kidney failure}} {{is the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in <b>dogs,</b> <b>at</b> 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetance may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.|$|E

5|$|Two {{officers}} from the gendarmerie, the Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR), arrived at the resort at 23:10 from Lagos, five miles (8km) away. At midnight, after briefly searching, they alerted the criminal police, the Polícia Judiciária, in nearby Portimão. Kate McCann said they arrived just after 1 am. According to the Polícia Judiciária, they arrived within 10 minutes of being alerted. Two patrol dogs {{were brought to the}} resort at 2am and four search-and-rescue <b>dogs</b> <b>at</b> 8am. Police officers had their leave cancelled and started searching waterways, wells, caves, sewers and ruins. Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, head of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão, became the inquiry's coordinator.|$|E
5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd dog who comes back to their home with one of their other <b>dogs.</b> <b>At</b> first, the dog, which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is {{too old to be}} retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the dog to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed the ending of the American version to be more optimistic.|$|E

25|$|Farm Sanctuary {{was founded}} in 1986 by Gene Baur and Lorri Houston (then known as Gene and Lorri Bauston).

25|$|Heavier dogs {{such as the}} Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs tend to have shorter lifespans than medium- and small-sized dogs; {{longevity}} is {{inversely related}} to breed size. Two websites list the life expectancy for Greater Swiss Mountain <b>Dogs</b> <b>at</b> 10 to 11 years; another lists it as 8–10 years. A survey by the US breed club shows a median lifespan of 6.75 years. Dog lifespans may vary in different countries, even in the same breed.|$|E
25|$|In 1789, {{after the}} fall of the Bastille, many members of the Queen's {{intimate}} circle were forced to flee abroad.

Marie Antoinette appointed Louise Élisabeth to the newly vacant post, with particular attention to be paid to the Dauphin, Louis-Charles.
