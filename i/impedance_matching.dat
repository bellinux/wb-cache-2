5|$|The Mk. IV was {{a complex}} lash-up of systems, known collectively in the RAF as the Airborne Radio Installation 5003 (ARI 5003). Individual parts {{included}} the R3066 or R3102 receiver, T3065 transmitter, Modulator Type 20, Transmitter Aerial Type 19, Elevation Aerial Type 25, Azimuth Aerial Type 21 and 25, <b>Impedance</b> <b>Matching</b> Unit Type 35, Voltage Control Panel Type 3, and Indicator Unit Type 20 or 48.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{tympanum}} and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called <b>impedance</b> <b>matching.</b> Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor <b>impedance</b> <b>matching,</b> so it is now {{thought that they were}} not used for hearing. Instead, these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch. Early temnospondyls, like Dendrerpeton, could not hear airborne sound but {{would have been able to}} detect vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound. The hearing system of Doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians.|$|E

40|$|Frequency-shift keying audio {{jointless}} {{track circuit}} {{is used in}} high-speed railway in China. However, within the station, track circuit with mechanical insulation is applied. In complex circuit network of electrified railway station, <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> bond is designed to ensure the normal operation of the track circuit {{and the protection of}} strong traction current interference. As a combination of strong and weak electricity components of track circuit, <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> bond is both the part of the loop of the traction current and the part of the transmission line of track circuit, playing a very critical role in the electrified railway. The structure of <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> bond is more complex than traditional impedance transformer, including the transformer with larger air-gap, LC resonance circuit for power frequency filtering, and components to enhance the signal frequency. Modeling on <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> bond and study about the four-terminal network parameters of <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> bond are in favor of the following two aspects: modeling of the overall traction current and calculation of track circuit working condition. By applying the transformer equivalent circuit model and combination of testing and calculation, the accurate model of <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> bond is constructed and verified. Finally, for ease of track circuit calculation, four-terminal network model of <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> bond under different signal carrier frequencies is presented...|$|R

5|$|Several {{improvements}} {{were made}} to image filters and their theory of operation by Otto Zobel. Zobel coined the term constant k filter (or k-type filter) to distinguish Campbell's filter from later types, notably Zobel's m-derived filter (or m-type filter). The particular problems Zobel was trying to address with these new forms were <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> into the end terminations and improved steepness of roll-off. These were achieved {{at the cost of}} an increase in filter circuit complexity.|$|E
5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of <b>impedance</b> <b>matching.</b> The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to {{this is where he}} speaks of <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a phantom circuit.|$|E
5000|$|A {{hydrophone}} can [...] "listen" [...] {{to sound}} in air {{but will be}} less sensitive due to its design as having a good acoustic <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> to water, which is a denser fluid than air. Likewise, a microphone can be buried in the ground, or immersed in water if it is put in a waterproof container, but will give similarly poor performance due to the similarly bad acoustic <b>impedance</b> <b>match.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The quality {{factors of}} several <b>impedance</b> <b>matched,</b> {{electrically}} small wire antennas are compared {{as a function}} of matching technique and antenna geometry. The antennas considered have the same height and wire diameter, and they are designed to be self-resonant at approximately the same frequency. The antennas are <b>impedance</b> <b>matched</b> to a nominal 50 Ohm characteristic impedance using either a parallel stub, lossless reactive network or lossless transformer. It is shown that the quality factors of the antennas are essentially the same, and for the most part, independent of the matching technique and differences in the antenna geometry. The quality factor of the <b>impedance</b> <b>matched,</b> electrically small antenna is primarily established by the antenna’s height and effective volume.

5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the Shive wave machine (also {{known as the}} Shive wave {{generator}}). The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and <b>impedance</b> <b>matching.</b> Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, stubs {{lend themselves}} to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs {{in the body of the}} filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|E
5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E

The front {{side of the}} metasurface is <b>impedance</b> <b>matched</b> to air and perfectly absorbing, while the backside is hard and totally reflecting. When a suitable DC voltage {{is applied to the}} backside DMR with proper electrodes, the surface impedance of {{the back side of the}} metasurfaces can be tuned from one extreme to the other, such that the backside becomes <b>impedance</b> <b>matched</b> to air and totally absorbing, while the front side becomes perfectly reflecting. The metasurface also exhibits high transmission contrast around two frequencies. The tunability of the reflection is over 23 dB at 388 Hz, and that of the transmission is over 33 dB at 240 Hz and 590 Hz with 600 V of applied voltage.

25|$|It was {{not unusual}} for {{electric}} recordings to be played back on acoustic phonographs. The Victor Orthophonic phonograph was a prime example where such playback was expected. In the Orthophonic, which benefited from telephone research, the mechanical pickup head was redesigned with lower resonance than the traditional mica type. Also, a folded horn with an exponential taper was constructed inside the cabinet to provide better <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> to the air. As a result, playback of an Orthophonic record sounded like {{it was coming from}} a radio.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel passivity-based {{teleoperation}} architecture for bilateral force and position tracking control problem.

Lyapunov stability methods are used to establish the range of position control gains on the master and slave side. We show the asymptotical stability of the system. Then the controller is designed considering a trade-off between an operationability and a position tracking performance. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed symmetric <b>impedance</b> <b>matched</b> teleoperation compared with the conventional one. I...|$|R
50|$|An L-network is the {{simplest}} circuit that will {{achieve the desired}} transformation; for any one given antenna and frequency, once a circuit is selected from the eight possible configurations (of which six are shown above) only one set of component values will <b>match</b> the in <b>impedance</b> to the out impedance. In contrast, the circuits described below all have three or more components, and hence have many more choices for inductance and capacitance that will produce an <b>impedance</b> <b>match.</b> The radio operator must experiment, test, and use judgement to choose among the many adjustments that produce the same <b>impedance</b> <b>match.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{use of an}} {{intermediate}} layer to form an anti-reflection coating {{can be thought of}} as analoguous to the technique of <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> of electrical signals. (A similar method is used in fibre optic research, where an index-matching oil is sometimes used to temporarily defeat total internal reflection so that light may be coupled into or out of a fiber.) Further reduced reflection could in theory be made by extending the process to several layers of material, gradually blending the refractive index of each layer between the index of the air and the index of the substrate.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} principle used {{in crystal}} radio design to transfer maximum {{power to the}} earphone is <b>impedance</b> <b>matching.</b> The maximum power is transferred {{from one part of}} a circuit to another when the impedance of one circuit is the complex conjugate of that of the other; this implies that the two circuits should have equal resistance. However, in crystal sets, the impedance of the antenna-ground system (around 10-200 ohms) is usually lower than the impedance of the receiver's tuned circuit (thousands of ohms at resonance), and also varies depending {{on the quality of the}} ground attachment, length of the antenna, and the frequency to which the receiver is tuned.|$|E
25|$|The stapes (stirrup) ossicle bone of {{the middle}} ear transmits {{vibrations}} to the fenestra ovalis (oval window) {{on the outside of the}} cochlea, which vibrates the perilymph in the vestibular duct (upper chamber of the cochlea). The ossicles are essential for efficient coupling of sound waves into the cochlea, since the cochlea environment is a fluid–membrane system, and it takes more pressure to move sound through fluid–membrane waves than it does through air; a pressure increase is achieved by the area ratio of the tympanic membrane to the oval window, resulting in a pressure gain of about 20 from the original sound wave pressure in air. This gain is a form of <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> – to match the soundwave travelling through air to that travelling in the fluid–membrane system.|$|E

50|$|Resistive <b>impedance</b> <b>matches</b> are {{easiest to}} design and can be {{achieved}} with a simple L pad consisting of two resistors. Power loss is an unavoidable consequence of using resistive networks, and they are only (usually) used to transfer line level signals.|$|R
25|$|Loudspeaker {{efficiency}} {{is defined as}} the sound power output divided by the electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> between the acoustic impedance of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of speaker enclosure designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.|$|E

The single channel dry EEG electrode construction and results were published in 1994. The arrayed electrode was also demonstrated to perform well compared to silver/silver chloride electrodes. The device consisted of four sites of sensors with integrated electronics to reduce noise by <b>impedance</b> <b>matching.</b> The advantages of such electrodes are: (1) no electrolyte used, (2) no skin preparation, (3) significantly reduced sensor size, and (4) compatibility with EEG monitoring systems. The active electrode array is an integrated system made of an array of capacitive sensors with local integrated circuitry housed in a package with batteries to power the circuitry. This level of integration was required to achieve the functional performance obtained by the electrode.|$|E
25|$|System {{noise is}} from the imaging hardware. One form is scanner drift, caused by the superconducting magnet's field {{drifting}} over time. Another form is changes in the current or voltage distribution of the brain itself inducing changes in the receiver coil and reducing its sensitivity. A procedure called <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> is used to bypass this inductance effect. There could also be noise from the magnetic field not being uniform. This is often adjusted for by using shimming coils, small magnets physically inserted, say into the subject's mouth, to patch the magnetic field. The nonuniformities are often near brain sinuses such as the ear and plugging the cavity for long periods can be discomfiting. The scanning process acquires the MR signal in k-space, in which overlapping spatial frequencies (that is repeated edges in the sample's volume) are each represented with lines. Transforming this into voxels introduces some loss and distortions.|$|E

However, for optimum <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> {{it is necessary to}} adjust both parameters solely for maximally flat image resistance in the passband.
