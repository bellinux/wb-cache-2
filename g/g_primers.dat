40|$|Abstract Background Microarray-based pooled DNA {{experiments}} that combine {{the merits of}} DNA pooling and gene chip technology constitute a pivotal advance in biotechnology. This new technique uses pooled DNA, thereby reducing {{costs associated with the}} typing of DNA from numerous individuals. Moreover, use of an oligonucleotide gene chip reduces costs related to processing various DNA segments (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>primers,</b> reagents). Thus, the technique provides an overall cost-effective solution for large-scale genomic/genetic research. However, few publicly shared tools are available to systematically analyze the rapidly accumulating volume of whole-genome pooled DNA data. Results We propose a generalized concept of pooled DNA and present a user-friendly tool named Microarray Pooled DNA Analyzer (MPDA) that we developed to analyze hybridization intensity data from microarray-based pooled DNA experiments. MPDA enables whole-genome DNA preferential amplification/hybridization analysis, allele frequency estimation, association mapping, allelic imbalance detection, and permits integration with shared data resources online. Graphic and numerical outputs from MPDA support global and detailed inspection of large amounts of genomic data. Four whole-genome data analyses are used to illustrate the major functionalities of MPDA. The first analysis shows that MPDA can characterize genomic patterns of preferential amplification/hybridization and provide calibration information for pooled DNA data analysis. The second analysis demonstrates that MPDA can accurately estimate allele frequencies. The third analysis indicates that MPDA is cost-effective and reliable for association mapping. The final analysis shows that MPDA can identify regions of chromosomal aberration in cancer without paired-normal tissue. Conclusion MPDA, the software that integrates pooled DNA association analysis and allelic imbalance analysis, provides a convenient analysis system for extensive whole-genome pooled DNA data analysis. The software, user manual and illustrated examples are freely available online at the MPDA website listed in the Availability and requirements section. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Study of {{the genetic}} {{structure}} specificity, intra- and interpopulation genetic variation of the brood stocks of Ukrainian scaled carp from different fish farms of Ukraine using DNA markers (ISSR-PCR). Methodology. A PCR (ISSR-PCR) method with appropriately selected primers {{has been used to}} investigate the genetic structure specificity. Findings. The genetic structure analysis of Ukrainian scaled carp has been carried out using three microsatellite DNA loci: (AGC) 6 G, (AСC) 6 G, (AGC) 6 С. In total, 55 amplicons were detected for all primers. Fifteen primers were detected when using (AGC) 6 <b>G</b> <b>primer,</b> 17 for (AСC) 6 <b>G</b> <b>primer</b> and 23 for (AGC) 6 С primer. The molecular weight on electropherograms had maximum values when using (AСC) 6 <b>G</b> <b>primer</b> (500 n. p. – 3500 n. p.) in Nyvky carp. The detected specific differences between the examined populations of scaled carp depend on their genetic origin. Variations of the detected amplicons are sufficient for separating individual fish or, if works are carried out with a group of broodfish, for selecting parental pairs for increasing genetic diversity. Originality. The use of ISSR-markers allowed detecting the peculiarities {{of the genetic}} structure, level of genetic variability of the brood stocks of Ukrainian scaled carp. For the first time, we obtained new data on the specificity of the genetic structure when using PCR techniques, which allow detecting specific mechanisms of the maintenance of the relative stability of the genetic material of Ukrainian scaled carps and allow controlling and preserving the specificity of their genetic structure. Practical value.

The uxaCA operon was amplified with <b>primers</b> <b>G</b> 1 a[*]+[*]G 1 b resulting in a 2, 981 -bp product, whereas the uxuAB operon was amplified with <b>primers</b> <b>G</b> 3 f[*]+[*]G 3 c resulting in a 2, 775 -bp product. Gene uxaB was amplified with <b>primers</b> <b>G</b> 2 d[*]+[*]G 2 c, gene kdgK with <b>primers</b> <b>G</b> 4 d[*]+[*]G 4 c, and eda was amplified with <b>primers</b> <b>G</b> 5 d[*]+[*]G 5 c resulting in 1, 519 -, 997 -, and 709 -bp PCR products, respectively. Through these primers, appropriate linker sequences and a ribosomal binding site (RBS) sequence were attached to each gene or operon to facilitate the Gibson assembly [44]. The genetic load was first divided due to the insert size. Therefore, genes uxuAB, kdgK, and eda were cloned into the SmaI-digested pEKEx 3 resulting in pEKEx 3 -uxuAB-kdgK-eda, designated as pAB 5. The insert of pAB 5 was amplified via PCR with <b>primers</b> <b>G</b> 3 d and G 5 d with a 4481 -bp PCR product.

Specimens measuring 4. 5 x 3. 5 x 4. 5 mm(3) were produced from Y-TZP presintered cubes and embedded in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Following finishing, the specimens were cleaned using an ultrasound device and distilled water and randomly divided into 10 experimental groups (n= 14) according to the heat treatment of the ceramic primer and aging condition. The strategies used for the experimental groups were: GC (control), without primer; <b>G</b> 20, <b>primer</b> application at ambient temperature (20 degrees C); <b>G</b> 45, <b>primer</b> application + heat treatment at 45 degrees C; <b>G</b> 79, <b>primer</b> application + heat treatment at 79 degrees C; and <b>G</b> 100, <b>primer</b> application + heat treatment at 100 degrees C. The specimens from the aging groups were submitted to thermal cycling (6000 cycles, 5 degrees C/ 55 degrees C, 30 seconds per bath) after 24 hours. A cylinder of MDP-based resin cement (2. 4 mm in diameter) was constructed on the ceramic surface of the specimens of each experimental group and stored for 24 hours at 37 degrees C. The specimens were submitted to a shear bond strength test (n= 14). Thermal gravimetric analysis was performed on the ceramic primer. The data obtained were statistically analyzed by two-way analysis of variance and the Tukey test (alpha= 0. 05). The experimental group G 79 without aging (7. 23 +/- 2. 87 MPa) presented a significantly higher mean than the other experimental groups without aging (GC: 2. 81 +/- 1. 5 MPa; G 20 : 3. 38 +/- 2. 21 MPa; G 100 : 3. 96 +/- 1. 57 MPa), showing no difference from G 45 only (G 45 : 6 +/- 3. 63 MPa). All specimens of the aging groups debonded during thermocycling and were considered to present zero bond strength for the statistical analyses. In conclusion, heat treatment of the metal/zirconia primer improved bond strength under the initial condition but did not promote stable bonding under the aging condition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{detection}} of leptospires in patient {{blood in the}} first week of the disease using PCR provides an early diagnostic tool. PCR using two sets of <b>primers</b> (<b>G</b> 1 /G 2 and B 64 -I/B 64 -II) tested with samples seeded with 23 leptospiral strains from pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains was able to amplify leptospiral DNA from pathogenic strains only. Of the 39 antibody negative samples collected from patients suspected for leptospirosis, only 1 sample (2. 6 %) was PCR positive. Using LSSP-PCR, the <b>G</b> 2 <b>primers</b> allowed the characterization of Leptopira species to 10 different genetic signatures which may have epidemiological value in determining species involved in outbreaks. Leptospiral outer membrane proteins from three strains were purified and reacted against patients sera and gave rise to different profiles for pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. Lymphocytes of mice injected with OMPs proliferated and released IFN- when stimulated in vitro using Leptospira OMP as antigens. This suggests that an immune response could be established using leptospiral OMPs as a putative vaccine.

40|$|Research has {{demonstrated}} that Laser‐Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) {{can be used as}} an effective method of screening for the common elemental components in gunshot residue. Barium (Ba), lead (Pb), and antimony (Sb) make up the primer cap of most ammunition involved in forensic gunshot residue analysis. Recently, ammunition manufacturers have started producing and popularizing ammunition with zinc (Zn), titanium (Ti), and gadolinium (<b>Gd)</b> <b>primer</b> components that are non‐toxic to the environment. This paper discusses the development of the Ole Miss Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry’s first LIBS instrument for forensic analysis of lead‐free using Gd as a tracer element for identification purposes. A Silva method of sampling was adopted using a non‐emissive 3 M tape to lift GSR from the subject’s hands after firing the weapon. Samples using the lead‐based and lead‐free bullets were analyzed by LIBS system consisting of an Ocean Optics USB 2000 CCD Camera with a Continuum 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser as the excitation source. Each sample was analyzed by multiple laser pulses fired at various locations on the sample surface. Spectra was taken from Ba, Pb, Zn, and Gd standards and emission lines were identified for all elements but Gd. Lead‐free and lead‐based gunshot residue sample spectra were also obtained, but were found to be too noisy for emission line identification {{due to the lack of}} a time‐ controlled camera system.

40|$|AbstractAmong 167 {{rotavirus}} specimens {{collected from}} {{young children in}} a suburban area of Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, from 1996 to 1998, most identifiable strains belonged to the uncommon P[6], G 2 type and approximately 50 % remained incompletely typed. In the present study, 76 such strains were further characterized. Due to interprimer interaction during the standard multiplex PCR approach, modifications of this procedure were implemented. The modified analyses revealed a high frequency of G 2, G 8, and G 9 genotypes, often combined with P[4] and/or P[6]. The Guinean G 8 and G 9 strains were 97 and 98 %, respectively, identical to other African G 8 and G 9 strains. Multiple G and/or P types were identified at a high frequency (59 %), including two previously undescribed mixed infections, P[4]P[6], G 2 G 8 and P[4]P[6], G 2 G 9. These mixed infections most likely represent naturally occurring reassortance of rotavirus strains. Detection of such strains among the previously incompletely typed strains indicates a potential underestimation of mixed infections, if only a standard multiplex PCR procedure is followed. Furthermore cross-priming of the <b>G</b> 3 <b>primer</b> with the <b>G</b> 8 <b>primer</b> binding site and silent mutations at the P[4] and P[6] primer binding sites were detected. These findings highlight the need for regular evaluation of the multiplex primer PCR method and typing primers. The high frequency of uncommon as well as reassortant rotavirus strains in countries where rotavirus is an important cause of child mortality underscores the need for extensive strain surveillance as a basis to develop appropriate rotavirus vaccine candidates...|$|R
40|$|Early {{detection}} of infection {{is very important}} for efficient management of Mycosphaerella graminicola leaf blotch. To monitor and quantify the occurrence of this fungus during the growing season, a diagnostic method based on real-time PCR was developed. Standard and real-time PCR assays were developed using SYBR Green chemistry to quantify M. graminicola in vitro or in wheat samples. Microsatellite dinucleotide specific-primers were designed based on microsatellite repeats of sequences present in the genome of M. graminicola. Specificity was checked by analyzing DNA of 55  M. graminicola isolates obtained from different geographical origins. The method appears to be highly specific for detecting M. graminicola; no fluorescent signals were observed from 14 other closely related taxa. <b>Primer</b> (CT) 7 <b>G</b> amplified a specific amplicon of 570  bp from all M. graminicola isolates. The primers did not amplify DNA extracted from 14 other fungal species. The approximate melting temperature (Tm) of the (CT) 7 <b>G</b> <b>primer</b> was 84. 2 °C. The detection limit of the real-time PCR assay with the primer sets (CT) 7 G is 10 fg/ 25 µL, as compared to 10 pg/ 25 µL using conventional PCR technology. From symptomless leaves, a PCR fragment could be generated two days after inoculation. Both conventional and real-time PCR could successfully detect the fungus from artificially inoculated wheat leaves. However, real-time PCR appeared much more sensitive than conventional PCR.

40|$|Sunflower (Helianthus annuus) {{being an}} {{important}} oil seed crop {{was chosen for}} this study, because genes isolated and characterized from sunflower will shed more light on plant development, and can also be useful in biotechnological applications. The study involved the isolation and characterization of two sunflower floral-specific genes: SF 15 (an anther-specific gene) and SF 17 (a pollen-specific gene). SF 15 : Northern blot analysis revealed that the probe hybridized to 1. 0 kb mRNA transcripts present in the young unopened disc florets, whose development was delineated into seven stages. SF 15 transcripts begin to accumulate in stage 1 and reach higher levels in stages 2, 3 and 4, while no expression was observed in late developmental stages 5 to 7 and the expression is confined only to the anthers of male-fertile disc florets. In situ hybridization experiments revealed that SF 15 is expressed {{in a single layer}} of epidermal cells of the anther. Screening of the floral cDNA library resulted in the isolation of 4 near full-length cDNA clones (SF 15 - 2, SF 15 - 3, SF 15 - 45 and SF 15 - 49). These cDNA clones have inserts of 785 to 934 bp.

The null hypothesis {{was that the}} "etch-and-rinse" adhesive system would generate higher bond strengths than the self-etching adhesives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two human molars were randomly divided into four groups (N = 32, n = 8 /per group) : <b>G</b> 1) ED <b>Primer</b> self-etching adhesive + Panavia F; G 2) All-Bond 2 "etch-and-rinse" adhesive + Panavia F; <b>G</b> 3) Multilink <b>primer</b> A/B self-etching adhesive + Multilink resin cement; G 4) All-Bond 2 + Multilink. After cementation of composite resin blocks (5 x 5 x 4 mm), the specimens were stored in water (37 degrees C, 24 hours), and sectioned to obtain beams (+/- 1 mm(2) of adhesive area) to be submitted to microtensile test. The {{data were analyzed using}} 2 -way analysis of variance and Tukey's test (alpha = 0. 05). RESULTS: Although the cement type did not significantly affect the results (p = 0. 35), a significant effect of the adhesive system (p = 0. 0001) was found on the bond strength results. Interaction terms were not significant (p = 0. 88751). The "etch-and-rinse" adhesive provided significantly higher bond strength values (MPa) with both resin cements (G 2 : 34. 4 +/- 10. 6; G 4 : 33. 0 +/- 8. 9) compared to the self-etching adhesive systems (G 1 : 19. 8 +/- 6. 6; G 3 : 17. 8 +/- 7. 2) (p < 0. 0001). Pretest failures were more frequent in the groups where self-etching systems were used. CONCLUSION: Although the cement type did not affect the results, there was a significant effect of changing the bonding strategy. The use of the three-step "etch-and-rinse" adhesive resulted in significantly higher bond strength for both resin cements on dentin. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dual polymerized resin cements tested could deliver higher bond strength to dentin in combination with "etch-and-rinse" adhesive systems as opposed to their use in combination with self-etching adhesives...|$|R

In doing so, the field of knowledge in electrostatic coating of plastic substrates has been expanded substantially.

By using suitable paint materials and innovative techniques, e. g. the employment of racks made of insulating material, contactless grounding by gas electrodes or the employment of repelling electrodes, insulating substrates can be coated directly by electrostatic techniques (e. g., by turbo bells). The potential for reducing the paint consumption is expected to be up to 50 %. For reducing paint sludge, it is expected to be up to 70 %. In addition, the application of electrostatic coating techniques often enables a higher line speed...|$|R
40|$|Determination of the G and P serotypes {{of group}} A bovine rotaviruses from 149 samples of feces or {{intestinal}} contents collected from calves showing clinical signs of neonatal diarrhea {{was performed by}} a nested reverse transcription-PCR typing assay. The G 6 serotype was the most prevalent, accounting for viruses in 55. 7 % of the samples; viruses of the G 10 and G 8 serotypes were found in 34. 9 and 4. 7 % of the samples, respectively. The virus in one sample (0. 7 %) was not classified due to concomitant infection with G 6 and G 8 strains, whereas viruses in six samples (4. 0 %) could not be characterized {{with any of the}} three <b>G</b> serotype-specific <b>primers</b> selected for the present study. When examined for their P-serotype specificities, viruses in 55 and 42. 3 % of the samples were characterized as P[11] and P[5], respectively, no P[1] serotype was identified, and viruses in 2. 7 % of the samples could not be classified due to multiple reactivity with both P[5]- and P[11]-specific primers. Various combinations of G and P serotypes were observed, the most frequent being G 6,P[5] (38. 3 %), G 10,P[11] (31. 5 %), and G 6,P[11] (15. 4 %). The results of the present study, while contributing {{to a better understanding of}} the epidemiology of bovine rotaviruses in Italy, address the relevance of serotype specificity with regard to the constancy of the quality of bovine rotavirus vaccines under different field conditions...|$|R
40|$|Lethal Yellowing disease locally called Cape Saint Paul {{wilt disease}} (CSPWD) is {{the bane of}} the coconut {{industry}} in Ghana and {{is caused by a}} phytoplasma. In Ghana, there are areas where the disease has re-infected re-plantings long after decimating all the palms in the area. This brings to the fore the possibility of alternate hosts in the spread of the disease because the pathogen is an obligate parasite. In this work, a number of plants were screened for their host status to the CSPWD pathogen. The presence of phytoplasmas in these plants was tested by polymerase chain reaction analysis using universal phytoplasma primers P 1 /P 7 and CSPWD-specific <b>primers</b> <b>G</b> 813 /GAKSR. Although Desmodium adscendens tested positive to the CSPWD-specific primers, cloning and sequencing did not confirm it as an alternate host.

30|$|The primers used in {{this study}} are listed in Additional file 1 : Table S 1. The human HA gene was derived from the Influenza A H 1 N 1 (A/New Caledonia/ 20 / 99) HA ORF {{mammalian}} expression plasmid (Sino Biological, Beijing, China). The DNA fragments encoding a binding domain (human short HA, amino acid residues No. 36 – 268) or encoding a binding domain and stem region (human long HA, amino acid residues No. 14 – 515) were PCR-amplified from the plasmid using the appropriate primers (“human short HA Forward” and “human short HA Reverse” for human short HA, or “human long HA Forward” and “human long HA Reverse” for human long HA). The DNA fragments were inserted into BglII/XhoI-digested pULD 1 (Kuroda et al. 2009), which encodes the C-terminal half of α-agglutinin downstream of the multiple cloning sites, using an In-Fusion HD Cloning kit (Clontech, Mountain view, CA). The resultant plasmids were named pULD-hSHAα 2, 6 and pULD-hLHAα 2, 6. The plasmids used for displaying the head domain recognizing α 2, 3 -linked sialic acid side chains on surface glycoproteins were constructed by mutating pULD-hSHAα 2, 6 or pULD-hLHAα 2, 6 using a QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and the “N 190 E Forward” and “N 190 E Reverse” or “D 225 G Forward” and “D 225 <b>G</b> Reverse” <b>primers.</b> The resultant plasmids were named pULD-hSHAα 2, 6 * and pULD-hLHAα 2, 6 *, respectively. pULD 1 -strep displaying a strep-tag instead of a FLAG-tag, was used as a negative control for immunofluorescence staining (Kuroda et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} (aFT 9 m) and a degenerate (aFT 9 d) {{version of}} the rotavirus <b>G</b> 9 -specific <b>primer</b> (aFT 9) allowed strains that were previously untypable, because of point mutations accumulating at the primer binding site, to be G typed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The strains were collected during 2001 - 2002 in Italy in hospitals of the Apulia region, from children affected by severe rotavirus-associated enteritis. Using {{a wide selection of}} G 9 rotaviruses detected worldwide, sequencing of the G 9 untypable strains, sequence comparison, and phylogenetic analysis showed that the Italian strains have strong genetic similarity (< or = 99. 4 %) to G 9 rotaviruses identified recently {{in many parts of the}} world and different from the old G 9 strains identified during the 1980 s (less than 90 %). Genetic variation of G 9 rotaviruses explains the constraints encountered in the typing assays and presumably accounts, together with genetic reassortment events, for the emergence on a global scale of the G 9 serotype...|$|R

The methods in hand for diagnosis of leptospirosis like culture, ELISA and MAT only help {{to confirm the}} disease, and are of little value in early detection. The {{aim of this study}} was to find out if the two sets of primers described earlier could detect all the isolates from the area, for the purpose of using the resultant database for early detection of leptospires in future from clinical specimens. The study was done on culture isolates from Jan 2000 to June 2002 attending the department of medicine, MOSC medical college hospital, Kolenchery, Kerala, India.

A total of 215 nontypeable rotavirus samples collected from children 5 years of age by members of the African Rotavirus Network were characterized using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis and sequencing. The most predominant strain identified was P[8]G 1 (46. 9 %). Genotypes P[8]G 10, P[8]G 8, P[6]G 8, and P[7]G 5 were also detected at frequencies varying from 0. 5 % to 2. 3 %. This study suggests that reassortment of unusual G types into a background of globally common genotype P[8] strains may be a major mechanism of generating rotavirus diversity. Nucleotide substitutions at the P[8], P[6], and <b>G</b> 1 <b>primer</b> binding sites accounted for the failure to type these strains initially. Hence, these findings highlight the need for regular evaluation of rotavirus genotyping methods.

40|$|Cyanobacteria of {{the genus}} Prochlorococcus are the most {{abundant}} photoautotrophs in the oceans. Prochlorococcus can be sub-divided into ecotypes that are genetically and physiologically diverse, which occupy different niches, with defined chemical and physical parameters. In this project environmental samples were collected during a north-south Atlantic transect cruise (AMT 15) {{for the study of}} Prochlorococcus and Prochlorococcus-infecting viral diversity. Novel Prochlorococcus-specific primers were successfully developed to investigate Prochlorococcus microdiversity. When applied to the environmental samples these probes exposed high diversity in Prochlorococcus assemblages. Prochlorococcus microdiversity exhibited correlations to latitude and temperature, at the depth to which 14 % of the surface lightÃ‚Â· levels penetrated. Phylogenetic analysis of these Prochlorococcus assemblages has revealed putatively novel lineages. Viruses that infect Prochlorococcus are abundant in the oceans and they are therefore likely to playa critical role in maintaining Prochlorococcus diversity. The analysis of environmental Prochlorococcus-infecting virus populations is still in its infancy, therefore viral isolation is important to understand the ecology of these viruses. The isolation of Prochlorococcus-infecting viruses has proven successful during this study. A podovirus was isolated from south Atlantic seawater samples. Given the unprecedentedly wide host of this isolate, podoviruses are likely to have exerted an influence on Prochlorococcus diversity, especially if they are present at high concentrations. To create genetic cut offs for the analysis cyanomyovirus diversity to a high resolution, existing <b>g</b> 20 <b>primers</b> were successfully coupled with a novel in silico RFLP approach. The myoviral diversity revealed was higher than previously seen and putatively novel myovirallineages were identified. Myovirus diversity was variable between the Atlantic samples and showed no significant correlations to environmental parameters or cyanobacteria. The genetic diversity dynamics of both host and myoviral communities were correlated with environmental parameters. This analysis indicated that temperature and myoviral diversity had the greatest impact on Prochlorococcus diversity. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
