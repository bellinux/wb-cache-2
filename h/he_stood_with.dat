5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
25|$|After {{retiring}} from playing {{he became a}} Test Match standard cricket umpire, standing in 212 First Class matches between 1930 and 1939 and 11 test matches from 1934 (England v Australia at Old Trafford) until 1939 (England vs West Indies at Lord's). <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> Frank Chester at The Oval in 1938 during England's record Ashes victory of an innings and 579 runs.|$|E

25|$|On 20 November 2003, Kadirgamar {{declared}} his candidacy {{for the position}} of Secretary-General of the Commonwealth of Nations. <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> the support of South Africa, which was critical of incumbent Don McKinnon's opposition to Zimbabwean involvement in the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2003, at which Zimbabwe withdrew from the organisation. In doing so, Kadirgamar broke the convention of not challenging incumbents for the position, which is usually appointed by consensus. However, at the vote, held in early December, he was defeated by the New Zealander, with 11 members voting for him against 40 for McKinnon.|$|E
25|$|Plamondon {{was also}} one of the more pro-labour members of the Tory caucus. In 1985, he {{promoted}} a partnership between the federal and Quebec governments and the Quebec Federation of Labour's Solidarity Fund. Two years later, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> striking letter carriers in Sorel and criticized his own government's decision to approve replacement workers. He was prominent among a group of Quebec Tory MPs who tried to reduce the party's reliance on corporate donations. Ricardo López, a right-wing Quebec Tory MP, once suggested that Plamondon would be more suited to the social democratic New Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|However, the 'Bandić problem' {{escalated}} in {{the coming}} months as the media continued to speculate about his potential candidacy. Bandić started to travel throughout Croatia without a stated common agenda, and the press followed his every step and constantly asked him if he would run for the presidency. He consistently refused to comment, drawing more and more media attention with his indecisiveness. Finally, the drama was concluded when he officially announced his candidacy for president in a speech on 5 November at 7am on Sljeme criticizing Zoran Milanović and his former party for turning against him saying {{that he was one of}} the founders of SDP emphasizing that <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> the party through the good and the bad times. Bandić was automatically expelled from SDP, losing his position as a member of party's presidency and leader of the Zagreb branch of SDP. Despite that, he declared on Croatian national television HRT that he still finds himself as true Social Democrat and that he'll proudly keep his SDP membership card nr. 2. SDP later made a statement that Bandić's membership card number was 38159.|$|E

500|$|Harper emerged a {{prominent}} {{member of the}} Reform Party caucus. He was active on constitutional issues during his first parliament, and played {{a prominent}} role in drafting the Reform Party's strategy for the 1995 Quebec referendum. A long-standing opponent of centralized federalism, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> Preston Manning in Montreal to introduce a twenty-point plan to [...] "decentralize and modernize" [...] Canada {{in the event of a}} [...] "no" [...] victory. Harper later argued that the [...] "no" [...] side's narrow plurality was a worst-case scenario, in that no-one had won a mandate for change.|$|E
500|$|The {{battle was}} lost for Frederick—it had {{actually}} been lost for the Prussians {{for a couple of}} hours—but he had not accepted this fact. Frederick rode among his melting army, snatched a regimental flag, trying to rally his men: Children, my children, come to me. Avec moi, Avec moi! [...] They did not hear him, or if they did, they chose not to obey. [...] Watching the chaos and seeking the coup de grâce, Saltykov threw his own Cossacks and Kalmyks (cavalry) into the fray. The Chuggavieski Cossacks surrounded Frederick on a small hill, where <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> the remnants of his body-guard—the Leib Cuirassiers—determined to either hold the line or to die trying. With a 100-strong hussar squadron, Rittmeister (cavalry captain) Joachim Bernhard von Prittwitz-Gaffron cut his way through the Cossacks and dragged the King to safety. Much of his squadron died in the effort. As the hussars escorted Frederick from the battlefield, he passed the bodies of his men, lying on their faces with their backs slashed open by Laudon's cavalry. A dry thunderstorm created a surreal effect.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the afternoon, crowds {{had filled}} the floor outside the blocked-off aisle, and the {{galleries}} as well, {{wanting to see}} the President, {{even if they could}} not greet him. [...] McKinley arrived just on time, glanced at the arrangements, and walked over to his place, where <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> Milburn on his left and Cortelyou on his right. [...] The pipe organ began to play [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] as McKinley ordered the doors open to admit those who had waited to greet him. The police let them in, and McKinley prepared to perform his [...] "favorite part of the job." [...] An experienced politician, McKinley could shake hands with 50 people per minute, gripping their hands first so as to both guide them past him quickly and prevent his fingers from being squeezed. [...] Cortelyou anxiously watched the time; about halfway through the ten minutes allotted, he sent word to Babcock to have the doors closed when the presidential secretary raised his hand. Seeing Cortelyou looking at his watch, Babcock moved towards the doors. [...] As the reception continued, the organist played works by Johann Sebastian Bach. The procession of citizens shaking hands with their President was interrupted when 12-year-old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook, New York, who was accompanied by her mother, asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on his lapel. [...] The President gave it to her, then resumed work without his trademark good-luck piece. [...] The Secret Service men looked suspiciously on a tall, swarthy man who appeared restless as he walked towards the President, but {{breathed a sigh of relief}} when he shook hands with McKinley without incident and began to move towards the exit. [...] The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced, perhaps due to the heat of the day, as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one, as if injured. [...] Seeing this, McKinley reached for his left hand instead. [...] As the two men's hands touched at 4:07pm, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen with a [...]32 Iver Johnson revolver concealed under the handkerchief.|$|E

2500|$|Toews criticized some {{criminal}} justice initiatives brought {{forward by the}} federal government of Jean Chrétien. In 1997, he announced that Manitoba would not enforce or administer the Canadian gun registry. Two years later, he described changes to the federal Young Offenders Act as both ineffective and too expensive. Toews nonetheless cooperated with the federal government on several issues. In March 1998, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> federal cabinet minister Lloyd Axworthy to announce a plan discouraging court sentences for non-violent aboriginal offenders. Toews said that the proposal was [...] "sensitive {{to the needs of the}} aboriginal community", and that it would reduce the number of repeat offenders.|$|E
2500|$|<b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> Darrell Hair in the Boxing Day Test between Australia and Sri Lanka at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1995, {{in which}} Hair no-balled Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing. [...] Dunne was criticised {{for failing to}} back Hair by {{similarly}} calling no-ball later in the match when Muralitharan bowled from Dunne's end, but he later defended himself, saying that the decision was too difficult to make on the field, and that he backed a previous decision to refer a bowler with a suspect action to the International Cricket Council for further investigation. [...] In 2001, he and Doug Cowie reported Shoaib Akhtar after an ODI in at Carisbrook in Dunedin.|$|E

2500|$|E. Urner Goodman {{also wrote}} the Owasippe Hymn {{that would become}} the Reservation's song that is sung {{at the end of}} all opening and closing campfires by the staff.

According to a now older staff alumni, Joseph Sener, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> Sheridan Nunn at the shore of the current location of the Blackhawk Fire-bowl during Camp Blackhawk's relocation and Nunn said, [...] "it was here at this spot in 1927 that I sat with E.

2500|$|Then it was Shane Bond's turn. He did {{not need}} to bat because of the {{substitute}} rule, and he came on for Nathan Astle at the start of India's innings. Taking the new ball, he immediately menaced the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly with short balls. Somehow, Ganguly survived the first over, but he was shaken and fell to Bond's eighth delivery of the day – caught by the wicket-keeper McCullum for 5. The next ball was faced by Venugopal Rao – an inswinging yorker that bamboozled the new batsman and slammed into his stumps, out bowled. And Bond just continued the slaughter. After he had bowled one ball of his sixth over, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> five wickets to his name, having added Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid and Mohammad Kaif to his tally. Andre Adams also took three wickets as India crashed to 44 for 8.|$|E
2500|$|Sutcliffe {{lacked the}} [...] "polished elegance of Hobbs" [...] {{as he was}} [...] "essentially a {{practical}} batsman with a superb judgment of length, pace and direction". [...] <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> {{the face of the}} bat very open (i.e., to the bowler) so that he could present its full width to the ball every delivery. He was noted as a firm striker off the front foot who also had efficient use of the pull and hook shots. [...] The 1933 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said of Sutcliffe, in respect of the record partnership with Percy Holmes in 1932, that [...] "like practically all great batsmen, he was generally at much pains to play himself in, and at all times his cricket – even when well set – proved rather more restrained than the situation warranted". The report {{goes on to say that}} Sutcliffe [...] "undoubtedly felt a heavy responsibility rested upon him" [...] but concluded by remarking on [...] "how he could hit when he considered he might set about run-getting in light-hearted fashion".|$|E

2500|$|Umfraville's {{loyalty to}} the new regime was {{appreciated}} by King Henry IV, who retained him for life for a annuity of forty pounds. At some point he was also knighted by the king; historian Henry Summerson has said this helped [...] "to ensure his loyalty against the Percys, his former lords" [...] who were growing increasingly dissatisfied with Henry. This paid off for the king, for, in 1405, when Archbishop Scrope rebelled, Umfraville joined the earl of Westmorland in suppressing the uprising at Shipton Moor. Uncommonly for a younger son in the Middle Ages, and probably another reflection of the high standing in which <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>with</b> the king, in 1408 Umfraville {{was elected to the}} Order of the Garter, whereupon he took the stall of Edmund, Earl of Kent, who had died that year. Umfraville's association with John Harding came about in 1402, when Harding's previous patron, Hotspur, was killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury, and Harding joined Umfraville's service after receiving a royal pardon to do so.|$|E
