40|$|AbstractTo {{cope with}} DNA double strand break (DSB) genotoxicity, cells have evolved two main repair pathways: {{homologous}} recombination which uses homologous DNA sequences as repair templates, and non-homologous Ku-dependent end-joining involving <b>direct</b> <b>sealing</b> of DSB ends by DNA ligase IV (Lig 4). During {{the last two}} decades a third player most commonly named alternative end-joining (A-EJ) has emerged, which is defined as any Ku- or Lig 4 -independent end-joining process. A-EJ increasingly appears as a highly error-prone bricolage on DSBs and despite expanding exploration, it still escapes full characterization. In the present review, we discuss the mechanism and regulation of A-EJ as well as its biological relevance under physiological and pathological situations, with a particular emphasis on chromosomal instability and cancer. Whether or not it is a genuine DSB repair pathway, A-EJ is emerging as an important cellular process and understanding A-EJ will certainly be a major challenge for the coming years...|$|E

50|$|Historically, some {{television}} {{cathode ray}} tubes {{were made by}} using ferric steel for the funnel and glass matched in expansion to ferric steel. The steel plate used had a diffusion layer enriched with chromium at the surface made by heating the steel together with chromium oxide in a HCl-containing atmosphere. In contrast to copper, pure iron does not bond strongly to silicate glass. Also, technical iron contains some carbon which forms bubbles of CO when it is sealed to glass under oxidizing conditions. Both are {{a major source of}} problems for the technical enamel coating of steel and make <b>direct</b> <b>seals</b> between iron and glass unsuitable for high vacuum applications. The oxide layer formed on chromium-containing steel can seal vacuum tight to glass and the chromium strongly reacts with carbon. Silver-plated iron was used in early microwave tubes.|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 9 Mechanical face seals {{have been}} used in fluid {{handling}} equipment for many years, with a long history of reliability and safety. Most users of mechanical seals, however, tend to have a few critical service areas where process operating conditions, changes, design, or installation problems, result in high maintenance dollar expenses, and a solution to these repeat problems can result in large savings through increasing the meantime between failures. The actual operating conditions in the seal chamber are frequently not known by the users. Process variables such as pressure, temperature, injection flow, and equipment wear on mechanical vibration problems, have a <b>direct</b> influence on <b>seal</b> performance. Process or operational upsets which cause seal leakage are frequently hard to detect. The development is documented of a seal monitoring system which was designed to measure and record actual operating conditions at a field site.

30|$|Face {{contact can}} affect sealing performance, such as dynamic behavior, thermo{{dynamics}}, friction, wear. The dynamics of face seals {{has been an}} active area since the works by Etsion [23 – 25]. In the aspect of gas face <b>seals,</b> <b>direct</b> numerical method [26 – 30] is detailed but computationally intensive, whilst semi-analytical method including perturbation method [31 – 34] and step jump method [35], on the other hand, is a more practical and efficient alternative but intensively depends on small displacement precondition. Before the introduction of asperity contact, stability and tracking {{have been used to}} illustrate the potential menace of face contact. Variables such as minimum film thickness, axial relative displacement and angular transmissibility are regarded as the indirect evaluation indexes of face contact. With the development of simulation, asperity contact models have been involved to directly gauge their influence on sealing dynamic performance. Harp and Salant [36] developed an axial dynamic model including the Abbott-Firestone plastic asperity contact model. Green [37] researched the transient performance of coned gas face seals during the startup operation by using the CEB model. Ruan [38] also used the CEB model to investigate the transient performance of spiral groove gas face seals during the startup and shutdown operations.|$|R

40|$|Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) often live in {{dark and}} turbid waters, where their mystacial vibrissae, or whiskers, play an {{important}} role in orientation. Besides detecting and discriminating objects by <b>direct</b> touch, harbor <b>seals</b> use their whiskers to analyze water movements, for example those generated by prey fish or by conspecifics. Even the weak water movements left behind by objects that have passed by earlier can be sensed and followed accurately (hydrodynamic trail following). While scanning the water for these hydrodynamic signals at a swimming speed in the order of meters per second, the seal keeps its long and flexible whiskers in an abducted position, largely perpendicular to the swimming direction. Remarkably, the whiskers of harbor seals possess a specialized undulated surface structure, the function of which was, up to now, unknown. Here, we show that this structure effectively changes the vortex street behind the whiskers and reduces the vibrations that would otherwise be induced by the shedding of vortices from the whiskers (vortex-induced vibrations). Using force measurements, flow measurements and numerical simulations, we find that the dynamic forces on harbor seal whiskers are, by at least an order of magnitude, lower than those on sea lion (Zalophus californianus) whiskers, which do not share the undulated structure. The results are discussed in the light of pinniped sensory biology and potential biomimetic applications...|$|R
