While Special Forces medical personnel can deliver clinic services and train local workers, there is an entire spectrum of ways to use FID to enhance public health.

Located next to the Abbassia Fever Hospital, the oldest and largest fever hospital in the Middle East, it does research with Egyptian personnel and scientific clinicals throughout Africa and Southwest Asia.

2500|$|The unborn widow poses {{a similar}} {{seemingly}} silly but logical problem. Suppose that property is left [...] "to A for life, then to his widow for life, then to A's issue." [...] Because the gift to A's widow cannot be resolved until A dies, {{the law will}} consider the possibility that, after the property is left to A, he marries {{a woman who was}} not born at the time the gift was made. For instance, it is possible that in 1950 the property is left to A, in 1955 a woman B is born, and in 1975 A and B marry each other (neither having issue at the time). Furthermore, it is possible that A will die, say in 1980, and his widow B will outlive him for more than 21 years. Suppose that she dies in 2005. [...] B was not a life in being {{at the time of the}} transfer, and the only remaining [...] "validating life" [...] under the rule against perpetuities <b>is</b> <b>A,</b> <b>who</b> has been dead for 25 years by this time. The gift to A's issue does not vest until his widow dies, and since that could theoretically happen more than 21 years after the death of all lives in being at the time of the transfer, the transfer to A's issue is invalid from the start.|$|E
