40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} the relative bioavailability of glycidol from <b>glycidyl</b> fatty acid <b>esters</b> in vivo, <b>glycidyl</b> palmitoyl <b>ester</b> and glycidol were orally applied to rats in equimolar doses. The time courses of the amounts of glycidol binding to hemoglobin {{as well as the}} excretion of 2, 3 -dihydroxypropyl mercapturic acids were determined. The results indicate that glycidol is released from the <b>glycidyl</b> <b>ester</b> by hydrolysis and rapidly distributed in the organism. In relation to glycidol, there was only a small timely delay in the binding to hemoglobin for the glycidol moiety released from the ester which may be certainly attributed to enzymatic hydrolysis. In both cases, however, an analogous plateau was observed representing similar amounts of hemoglobin binding. With regard to the urinary excretion of mercapturic acids, also similar amounts of dihydroxypropyl mercapturic acids could be detected. In an ADME test using a virtual double tag (3 H, 14 C) of <b>glycidyl</b> palmitoyl <b>ester,</b> a diverging isotope distribution was detected. The kinetics of the 14 C-activity reflected the kinetics of free glycidol released after hydrolysis of the palmitoyl ester. In view of this experimental data obtained in rats, it is at present justified for the purpose of risk assessment to assume complete hydrolysis of the <b>glycidyl</b> <b>ester</b> in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, assessment of human exposure to <b>glycidyl</b> fatty acid <b>ester</b> should be regarded as an exposure to the same molar quantity of glycidol...|$|R

40|$|EFSA {{was asked}} to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on free and esterified 3 - and 2 -monochloropropane- 1, 2 -diol (MCPD) and <b>glycidyl</b> <b>esters</b> in food. Esters of 3 - and 2 -MCPD and glycidol are contaminants of processed vegetable oils; free MCPDs are formed in some processed foods. The Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) evaluated 7, 175 occurrence data. Esters of 3 - and 2 -MCPD and <b>glycidyl</b> <b>esters</b> were found {{at the highest levels}} in palm oil/fat, but most vegetable oil/fats contain substantial quantities. Mean middle bound (MB) dietary exposure values to total 3 -MCPD, 2 -MCPD and glycidol, respectively, across surveys and age groups in µg/kg body weight (bw) per day were 0. 2 – 1. 5, 0. 1 – 0. 7 and 0. 1 – 0. 9; high exposure (P 95) values were 0. 3 – 2. 6, 0. 2 – 1. 2 and 0. 2 – 2. 1. Animal studies show extensive hydrolysis of esterified 3 -MCPD and glycidol following oral administration; esterified and free forms were assumed to contribute equally to internal exposures. Nephrotoxicity was consistently observed in rats treated with 3 -MCPD. Data on 2 -MCPD toxicity were insufficient for dose–response assessments. Chronic treatment with glycidol increased the incidence of tumours in several tissues of rats and mice, likely via a genotoxic mode of action. The Panel selected a BMDL 10 value for 3 -MCPD of 0. 077 mg/kg bw per day for induction of renal tubular hyperplasia in rats and derived a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0. 8 µg/kg bw per day. The mean exposure to 3 -MCPD was above the TDI for ‘Infants’, ‘Toddlers’ and ‘Other children’. For glycidol, the Panel selected a T 25 value of 10. 2 mg/kg bw per day for neoplastic effects in rats. The margins of exposure (MoEs) were 11, 300 – 102, 000 and 4, 900 – 51, 000 across surveys and age groups at mean and P 95 exposures, respectively. An exposure scenario for infants receiving formula only resulted in MoEs of 5, 500 (mean) and 2, 100 (P 95). MoEs of 25, 000 or higher were considered of low health concern. <br/...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{processing}} derived contaminants 2 - and 3 -monochloropropanediol (2 - and 3 -MCPD) esters and <b>glycidyl</b> <b>esters</b> (GEs) were analysed in 84 oil samples by GC–MS/MS for the discrimination of processing grades of olive oils {{as a potential}} authentication tool. Concentrations of 2 - and 3 -MCPD esters and GEs varied in the ranges 0 – 6 mg/kg, 0 – 1. 5 mg/kg, and 0 – 1 mg/kg oil, respectively.

A similar difference was observed for other refined and cold-pressed vegetable oils. The limit of fraud detection of lower grade oils in EVOO was 2 % when using 3 -MCPD esters, 5 % for 2 -MCPD esters, and 13 – 14 % for GEs based on calculations of virtual mixtures of the current sample set.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the reactions of <b>glycidyl</b> ether, <b>glycidyl</b> <b>ester</b> and other oxirane functional resins with carboxyl or anhydride functional compounds and polymers {{in the presence of}} a wide range of amine, phosphonium and metal catalysts. We confirmed that both amine and phosphonium compounds can catalyze the reaction of epoxy groups with carboxyl and anhydride groups. There are certain deficiencies with these catalysts, such as a tendency to yellow and a reduction in stability at ambient or elevated temperatures. We also observed that many of the known amine catalysts contribute to poorer humidity resistance and exterior durability. Several metal salts were found to be effective catalysts, but they also contributed to a reduction in chemical resistance or they led to paint instability. We have discovered a group of metal chelates that overcome these problems and provide stable formulations in a single package that do not yellow during cure and that give improved resistance properties.

The EGS and ESO, for comparison, were used neat and in blends with diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA). Thermosetting resins were fabricated with the epoxy monomers and either BF 3 catalyst or anhydride. The curing behaviors, glass transition temperatures, crosslink densities and mechanical properties were tested. The results indicated that polymer glass transition temperatures were mostly a function of oxirane content with additional influence of glycidyl versus internal oxirane reactivity, pendant chain content, and chemical structure and presence of saturated components. EGS provided better compatibility with DGEBA, improved intermolecular crosslinking and glass transition temperature, and yielded mechanically stronger polymerized materials than materials obtained using ESO. Other benefits of the EGS resin blend systems were significantly reduced viscosities compared to either DGEBA or ESO-blended DGEBA counterparts. Therefore, EGS that is derived from renewable sources has improved potential for fabrication of structural and structurally complex epoxy composites, e. g., by vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of undesirable compounds in vegetable and animal {{oils and fats}} may have many different origins. Although the potential toxicity of most of these undesirable compounds is real, poisoning risks are rather limited due to the efficient elimination during oil-refining steps, careful conditioning, choice of efficient packaging and industrial quality control management. However the research of contaminants is part of multiple controls conducted by fat and oil industry to verify the conformity of products placed on the market in relation to regulations such as the European commission regulation EC No. 1881 / 2006 setting maximum levels for some contaminants in food as lead, some mycotoxins, dioxins, polychlorobiphenyls, benzo[a]pyrene. In the absence of regulation, the detection of contaminants must be addressed in partnership with authorities according to the toxicity of molecules. The controls are not confined to environmental contaminants. They also include compounds that can be formed during the production process of vegetable oils such as esters of 3 -monochloropropanediol.

40|$|<b>Glycidyl</b> <b>esters</b> (GE), {{fatty acid}} esters of glycidol, are process {{contaminants}} formed during edible oil processing. A novel direct method for {{the determination of}} intact GE in oils and fats based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is presented. The method consists of a simple extraction step of GE from the lipid matrix, purification of the extract and isolation of GE by normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC). Individual GE in the final fraction are separated and quantified by standard GC-MS operated in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The setup and conditions of the GC-MS were optimized {{in such a way}} that thermal degradation of GE and artifact formation were prevented. The method exhibits very good performance parameters: the limit of detection was approximately 0. 01 mg/kg for the individual GE (corresponding to 0. 002 - 0. 003 mg/kg of free glycidol), the repeatability was in the range of 5 - 12 % for individual GE at levels above 0. 1 mg/kg, and recovery values ranged from 85 to 115 % depending on the level and the chain identity of the GE.

40|$|There is {{nowadays}} {{an increasing}} demand for low VOC systems in automotive refinish industry. These systems should also cure sufficiently fast {{at ambient temperature}} {{in order to reduce}} the investment in drying equipment and the time of repair. However, matching the stringent chemical and mechanical requirements associated with medium solid systems, and reaching a VOC level < 420 g/l (from UK and Dutch legislation) is a challenge, especially if the coatings are cured at room temperature. Extensive research has been carried out on high solids resins making use of CARDURA(1) E 10 (the <b>glycidyl</b> <b>ester</b> of VERSATIC acid) in conjunction with acrylic and methacrylic monomers. The efficient use of these building blocks allowed the cost-effective production of resins matching all coating requirements at a VOC level below 420 g/l after cure at ambient as well as elevated temperatures. These ambient cure clear coat systems exhibit a very good overall performance and should therefore form a good starting point for very high solids acrylic-urethane coatings for automotive refinish applications.

The mechanical properties, morphology, and thermal performance were investigated. The nonisothermal crystallization, melting behavior, and nonisothermal crystallization kinetics were investigated by DSC. The {{results indicated that}} the addition of MCC had led to the increase of the tensile strength, impact strength, and flexural strength of PP. PP-g-GMA modification was more conducive to the improvement in tensile strength, impact strength, and flexural strength. The three types of PP/MCC composites have higher thermal decomposition temperatures, Vicat softening temperatures, and dimensional stability. Nonisother-mal crystallizations of PP/MCC composites were in accordance with tridimensional growth with heterogeneous nucleation. Meanwhile, MCC was acted as the nucleating agent in PP matrix, which increased the crystallization temperature. PP-g-GMA further increased the crystallization temperature while PP-g-MA weakened the heterogeneous nucleation effect of MCC. Avrami equation and Mo method give a satisfactory description of the crystallization kinetics process. The activation energy of crystallization, nucleation constant, and fold surface free energy of PP were markedly reduced in PP/MCC composites and its compatibilized composites.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of polymer nanocomposites has received extensive attention {{over the last}} few decades. The ability to alter functionalities of composites, dramatically improving properties and performance at low filler content creates flexibility in designing materials for advanced applications in various industrial fields. This work focuses on nanocomposites relevant to the packaging and aerospace industries. This work evaluated the ability to homogeneously distribute nanomaterials into a polymer matrix, understand the effects on rheological properties, understand changes to microstructure and effects, and characterize properties of resulting nanocomposite. High torque melt mixing was used to disperse surface modified cellulose nanocrystals in a poly(lactic acid) (PLA) resin and graphene in a phenylethynyl terminated imide resin, PETI 298, using bulk graphite. Rheology, Raman spectroscopy, and X-Ray powder diffraction were applied for the understanding of changes to the microstructure and location of optimum loading by the determination of the percolation threshold. Thermomechanical performance was evaluated through TGA, DMA, and DSC. It was determined that graphene and short stacks of graphene could be dispersed and distributed at low loadings in PETI 298. As expected, the addition of graphitic material led to an increase in viscosity, but also caused a retardation of the cure which could be attributed to increased viscosity or quenching of free radicals. Changes to the microstructure were difficult to evaluate because of the competing chemistry occurring in the system but it could be determined that something significant occurs around 1 wt % at which the melt rheology and the microstructure behavior was different from other composites. It was further determined that the melt mixing process {{led to the formation of}} an ordered structured. Modification of the cellulose nanocrystals (m-CNC) with Cardura, <b>glycidyl</b> <b>ester,</b> provided no improvement to mechanical properties of PLA composites.

40|$|Exposure {{assessment}} {{is a fundamental}} part of the risk assessment paradigm, but can often present a number of challenges and uncertainties. This is especially the case for process contaminants formed during the processing, e. g. heating of food, since they are in part highly reactive and/or volatile, thus making exposure assessment by analysing contents in food unreliable. New approaches are therefore required to accurately assess consumer exposure and thus better inform the risk assessment. Such novel approaches may {{include the use of}} biomarkers, physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modelling-facilitated reverse dosimetry, and/or duplicate diet studies. This review focuses {{on the state of the}} art with respect to the use of biomarkers of exposure for the process contaminants acrylamide, 3 -MCPD esters, <b>glycidyl</b> <b>esters,</b> furan and acrolein. From the overview presented, it becomes clear that the field of assessing human exposure to process-related contaminants in food by biomarker monitoring is promising and strongly developing. The current state of the art as well as the existing data gaps and challenges for the future were defined. They include (1) using PBK modelling and duplicate diet studies to establish, preferably in humans, correlations between external exposure and biomarkers; (2) elucidation of the possible endogenous formation of the process-related contaminants and the resulting biomarker levels; (3) the influence of inter-individual variations and how to include that in the biomarker-based exposure predictions; (4) the correction for confounding factors; (5) the value of the different biomarkers in relation to exposure scenario’s and risk assessment, and (6) the possibilities of novel methodologies. In spite of these challenges it can be concluded that biomarker-based exposure assessment provides a unique opportunity to more accurately assess consumer exposure to process-related contaminants in food and thus to better inform risk assessment...|$|E
