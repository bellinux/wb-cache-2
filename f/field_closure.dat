Particular emphasis is given to the strongly correlated regime, where dynamics are found to exhibit universal scaling in terms of a field-dependent low energy coherence scale.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{turbulence}} modeling on {{the prediction of}} equilibrium states of turbulent buoyant shear flows were investigated. The velocity field models used include a two-equation closure, a Reynolds-stress closure assuming two different pressure-strain models and three different dissipation rate tensor models. As for the thermal <b>field</b> <b>closure</b> models, two different pressure-scrambling models and nine different temperature variance dissipation rate (ε θ) equations were considered. The emphasis {{of this paper is}} focused on the effects of the ε θ-equation, of the dissipation rate models, of the pressure-strain models and of the pressure-scrambling models on the prediction of the approach to equilibrium turbulence. Equilibrium turbulence is defined by the time rate of change of the scaled Reynolds stress anisotropic tensor and heat flux vector becoming zero. These conditions lead to the equilibrium state parameters, given by P̃/ε, P̃ θ/ε θ, R = (θ 2 / 2 ε θ) /(k/ε), Sk/ε and G/ε, becoming constant. Here, P̃ and P̃ θ are the production of turbulent kinetic energy k and temperature variance θ 2, respectively, ε and ε θ are their respective dissipation rates, R is the mixed time scale ratio, G is the buoyant production of k and S is the mean shear gradient. Calculations show that the ε θ-equation has a significant effect on the prediction of the approach to equilibrium turbulence. For a particular ε θ-equation, all velocity closure models considered give an equilibrium state if anisotropic dissipation is accounted for {{in one form or another}} in the dissipation rate tensor or in the ε-equation. It is further found that the models considered for the pressure-strain tensor and the pressure-scrambling vector have little or no effect on the prediction of the approach to equilibrium turbulence.

The occurrence of subsidence, that could partly be related to hydrocarbon production, both on-shore and off-shore, can generate great concern in those areas where its occurrence may have impacts on the local environment. ENI, following the international scientific community recommendations on the matter, {{since the beginning of}} 90 's years, implemented a cutting-edge monitoring network, with the aim to prevent, mitigate and control geodynamics phenomena generated in the activity areas, with a particular attention to conservation and protection of environmental and territorial equilibrium, taking care of what is known as "sustainable development". The current ENI implemented monitoring surveys can be divided as: – Shallow monitoring: spirit levelling surveys, continuous GPS surveys in permanent stations, SAR surveys, assestimeter subsurface compaction monitoring, ground water level monitoring, LiDAR surveys, bathymetrical surveys. – Deep monitoring: reservoir deep compaction trough radioactive markers, reservoir static (bottom hole) pressure monitoring. All the information, gathered through the monitoring network, allow: 1. to verify if the produced subsidence is evolving accordingly with the simulated forecast. 2. to provide data to revise and adjust the prediction compaction models 3. to put in place the remedial actions if the impact exceeds the threshold magnitude originally agreed among the involved parties.
