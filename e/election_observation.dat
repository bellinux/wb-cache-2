25|$|The ENEMO (Еuropean Network of Election Monitoring Organizations) {{mission for}} the 2012 {{parliamentary}} elections in Ukraine began its work on 23 July 2012 {{with the arrival}} of four Core Team members. ENEMO is the first international <b>election</b> <b>observation</b> mission registered for the Parliamentary Elections 2012 by the Central Election Commission (CEC). 35 LTOs (long-term observers) arrived to Kyiv on 5 August 2012 and were deployed throughout Ukraine. Long-term observer teams cover one or two oblasts of Ukraine. On E-day, October 28, ENEMO deployed 43 STO (Short-term observer) teams throughout all oblasts of Ukraine.|$|E
500|$|In September 2008, {{parliamentary}} elections were held. Lukashenko had allowed some opposition candidates to stand, {{though in the}} official results, opposition members failed to get a seat out of the available 110. OSCE observers described the vote as [...] "flawed", including [...] "several cases of deliberate falsification of results". Opposition members and supporters demonstrated in protest. According to the Nizhny Novgorod-based CIS <b>election</b> <b>observation</b> mission, the findings of which are often dismissed by the West, the elections in Belarus conformed to international standards. Lukashenko later commented that the opposition in Belarus was financed by foreign countries and was not needed.|$|E

40|$|International <b>{{election}}s</b> <b>observation</b> cannot make {{an election}} free and fair. In any case {{this would not}} guarantee well-institutionalised political parties and party competition or the consolidation of liberal democracy. Parties influence elections. Could international assistance to parties help compensate for the limitations of <b>elections</b> <b>observation?</b> The reality is that party aid has limitations of its own. Closer coordination of elections and party support may offer a partial solution but is not unproblematic...|$|R

2500|$|On 3 November the International <b>Election</b> <b>Observation</b> Mission, {{composed}} of the Parliamentary Assemblies of the OSCE and the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), concluded that the 2 November parliamentary elections in Georgia fell short {{of a number of}} OSCE commitments and other international standards for democratic elections. Mikheil Saakashvili claimed that he had won the elections (a claim supported by independent exit polls). This was confirmed by an independent parallel vote tabulation (PVT) conducted by the ISFED (International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy, a local election monitoring group). Saakashvilli and the United Opposition accepted ISFED's PVT as [...] "official" [...] results, and urged Georgians to demonstrate against Shevardnadze's government and engage in nonviolent civil disobedience against the authorities. The main democratic opposition parties united to demand the ousting of Shevardnadze and the rerun of the elections.|$|E
2500|$|Allegations {{of fraud}} were made, {{and were not}} far-fetched. On the day {{preceding}} the election, Transparencia, the national <b>election</b> <b>observation</b> organization, reported that it had received information concerning a website with capabilities to hack into the ONPE (Oficina Nacional de Procesos Electorales) computer system. Eduardo Stein also claimed that ONPE had made no provisions for OAS technicians to monitor the vote count system in real time. Toledo claimed that a fraud had been perpetrated; other opposition candidates agreed and joined protests led by Toledo. Though [...] "the U.S. State Department had supported Fujimori and his economic policies, it described {{the results of the}} 2000 elections as [...] "invalid". Since no candidate had received a majority of the vote, a runoff was required, but Toledo refused to participate in a second round against Fujimori. He unsuccessfully petitioned to have the election annulled, and lobbied international organizations and foreign government to deny recognition to Fujimori's government.|$|E

50|$|Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL), a Bangkok-based {{election}} monitoring organisation, has publicly called the <b>election</b> <b>observations</b> inadequate, {{failing to meet}} international standards, being too restrictive (only two observers are allowed per government, or five for ASEAN nations), and coming too late (invitations were sent {{less than two weeks}} before the election date), all of which make it logistically impossible to monitor all 48 polling stations. On 20 March 2012, Somsri Hananuntasuk, executive director of ANFREL, was deported from Yangon, purportedly for entering the country on a tourist visa.|$|R

40|$|<b>Election</b> {{monitoring}} and <b>observation</b> {{are an integral}} part of an electoral process. They help to enhance the transparency and credibility of elections as well as the acceptance of results. Challenges faced by <b>election</b> {{monitoring and}} <b>observation</b> organizations include: the need for coordination and cooperation among observer groups; the need for follow-up on recommendations made after an election; the need to develop technologies appropriate for assessing e-voting technologies; and the need to develop commonly shared criteria for assessing democratic elections. In addition, challenges peculiar to Nigeria include: difficult terrain, poor Internet coverage, poor electricity and political instability bringing about insecurity. In this paper, we present contemporary e-messaging tools and initiatives that will help to address these challenges and thereby enhance the efficiency of <b>election</b> monitoring and <b>observation</b> missions...|$|R
5000|$|During the Armenian {{parliamentary}} election, 2017, a voter {{authentication system}} {{was used for}} the first time. The identity of the voter was validated prior to voting using Voter Authentication Devices (VADs), which contained an electronic copy of the voter lists. The introduction of new technologies in the electoral process was strongly supported by the opposition and civil society. Smartmatic provided 4,000 Voter Authentication Devices to the UNDP project “Support to the Electoral Process in Armenia” (SEPA). It was funded by the EU, United States, Germany, United Kingdom, and the Government of Armenia. According to final reports from The International <b>Elections</b> <b>Observation</b> Missions (IEOM) “The VADs functioned effectively and without significant issues.” Observers reported the introduction of the VADs was welcomed by most IEOM interlocutors as a useful tool for building confidence in the integrity of Election Day proceedings.|$|R

However, they mentioned in the final report that the late introduction of the VADs could have led to a limited time for testing of equipment and training of operators, stating [...] "Observers noted some problems with scanning of ID documents and fingerprints; however, this did not lead to significant disruptions of voting. IEOM observers noted 9 cases of voters attempting multiple voting that were captured by the VADs. The VADs provided the possibility for voters to be redirected, in case they were registered in another polling station in the same TEC, and this was observed in 55 polling stations." ...|$|R
5000|$|Alan Dershowitz {{asserts that}} the Center's focus [...] "is away from {{significant}} Arab abuses and on Israel's far less serious ones" [...] {{and that this is}} influenced by the Center's receipt of donations from Arab sources. [...] One of the initial contributors to the Center was Bank of Commerce and Credit International founder Agha Hasan Abedi, who donated $500,000. Abedi and BCCI also donated $8 million to Carter's Global 2000 project. According to the Center, 3 percent of the total amount of contributions it has received since its founding in 1982 have been from donors in Mideast Arab nations. [...] Of the donations from the Middle East, the Center states: [...] "Seventy-eight percent of those funds have helped to support health programs in Africa, 14 percent have gone to the institution's endowment, 4 percent were for original construction of buildings at headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and 4 percent for projects to directly promote peace, such as specific <b>election</b> <b>observations.</b>|$|R

It complained of [...] "a lack of a level playing field, caused primarily by the abuse of administrative resources, lack of transparency of campaign and party financing, and lack of balanced media coverage".

40|$|The I-Voting system {{designed}} and implemented in Estonia {{is one of}} the first nationwide Internet voting systems. Since its creation, it has been met with praise but also with close scrutiny. Concerns regarding security breaches have focused on in-person <b>election</b> <b>observations,</b> code reviews and adversarial testing on system components. These concerns have led many to conclude that there are various ways in which insider threats and sophisticated external attacks may compromise the integrity of the system and thus the voting process. In this paper, we examine the procedural components of the I-Voting system, with an emphasis on the controls related to procedural security mechanisms, and on system-transparency measures. Through an approach grounded in primary and secondary data sources, including interviews with key Estonian election personnel, we conduct an initial investigation into the extent to which the present controls mitigate the real security risks faced by the system. The experience and insight we present in this paper will be useful both in the context of the I-Voting system, and potentially more broadly in other voting systems...|$|R
