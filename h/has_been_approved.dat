5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>approved</b> and is commercially {{available}} {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E
5|$|Organic {{apples are}} {{commonly}} {{produced in the}} United States. Due to infestations by key insects and diseases, organic production is difficult in Europe. The use of pesticides containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (pyrethrum, neem) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>approved</b> by the EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality. A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple sun scalding.|$|E

Quinoline Yellow (E104) is a commonly used coloring in the United Kingdom but is banned in Australia, Japan, Norway and the United States. Green S (E142) is prohibited in many countries, for it is known to cause hyperactivity, asthma, urticaria, and insomnia.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{progressive}} multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients {{do not respond}} to any available therapy, and no treatment <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>approved</b> specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or riluzole. People with PPMS have also been included in trials of azathioprine, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E

5|$|Some {{international}} broadcasters {{have turned}} to a digital mode of broadcasting called Digital Radio Mondiale for their shortwave outlets. One reason is that digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less transmitter power — roughly one-fifth the power — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a power rating of 50 kilowatts {{to as much as}} one million watts per transmitter, with typical power levels in the 50–500 kilowatt range. Endorsed by the ITU, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>approved</b> as an international standard for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and web pages via a separate information channel.|$|E
5|$|A northwestern {{expansion}} of the City Circle Line was planned, where M4 would divert at Nørrebro and run to the suburbs of Brønshøj and Gladsaxe. This project was abandoned, as the interchange chamber between any such line and the City Circle Line was scrapped {{as part of the}} City of Copenhagen's 2009 budget. In subsequent plans, the northern extension of the M4 has instead been relocated as a Nordhavn branch which will connect with the City Circle Line at Østerport. A Nordhavn line with two stations <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>approved</b> by the Danish parliament, and is planned to open in 2019. The southern extension of the M4 will run from Copenhagen Central Station through Sydhavn to Ny Ellebjerg, where the M4 will link up with the S-train and regional train system. The Danish Transport Authority (Trafikstyrelsen) has suggested to convert the F-line of the S-train network to metro standard as an M5 line, but as the only linkup between the M5 and the existing network would be at Flintholm Station (interchange with M1 and M2), this plan is dependent on the approval of a southern extension of the M4, also providing the M5 with an interchange with the M4 at Ny Ellebjerg Station.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the Metro {{started in}} 1992 {{as part of}} the {{redevelopment}} plans for Ørestad with construction starting in 1996, and stage 1, from Nørreport to Vestamager and Lergravsparken, opened in 2002. Stage 2, from Nørreport to Vanløse, opened in 2003, followed by stage 3, from Lergravsparken to Lufthavnen, in 2007. Construction of the M3+M4 City Circle Line is underway. Scheduled to open in 2019, this line will form a circle around the city center, be entirely underground and not share any track with M1 and M2. Kongens Nytorv and Frederiksberg will serve as interchanges between M1, M2 and M3+M4. A two-station branch towards Nordhavn is planned to open in 2019. A planned expansion towards Sydhavn will include a linkup with Ny Ellebjerg on the S-train network (2023). These stations will also be connected to the regional train network following the completion of the new Copenhagen-Ringsted railway. The Sydhavn extension <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>approved.</b>|$|E
