This means the first futures price might be at $57 and the next contract at $56. You go long the front contract as described above. Now suppose a few weeks pass and nothing happens to the spot price. The futures contract you own moves toward the spot price as delivery approaches, and we can assume the spread between the futures stays at a dollar. You sell your maturing futures near the $58 spot price and buy the next future for around $57.

JEL Classification: Q 13 A principal theory of futures markets tells that futures prices for storable commodities should be higher than spot prices by not more than the carrying charges. Carrying charges repre-sent the cost of storage, primarily warehousing and insurance cost plus interest foregone. If the spot price is too low relative to the futures price, a cash-and-carry arbitrage opportunity arises and the trader who engages in arbitrage reaps a riskless profit. Thus, in a normal mar-ket, a futures price spread is limited by arbi-trage to the full cost of carry. However, this theory is not always sup-ported by empirical evidence. A puzzling phe-nomenon in lctual commodity markets is that processors and nerchandisers routinely hold inventories in the face of inverse carrying charges. In an <b>inverted</b> <b>market,</b> a commodity's price for future delivery is below the price for immediate delivery and intertemporal arbi...|$|E

It is argued that modern studies have focused primarily on technical questions, with insufficient economic content.

40|$|Efficient, accurate, multi-dimensional, {{numerical}} integration {{has become}} an important tool for approximating the integrals which arise in modern economic models built on unobserved heterogeneity, incomplete information, and uncertainty. This paper demonstrates that polynomialbased rules out-perform number-theoretic quadrature (Monte Carlo) rules {{both in terms of}} efficiency and accuracy. To show the impact a quadrature method can have on results, we examine the performance of these rules in the context of Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) 's model of product differentiation, where Monte Carlo methods introduce considerable numerical error and instability into the computations. These problems include inaccurate point estimates, excessively tight standard errors, instability of the inner loop 'contraction' mapping for <b>inverting</b> <b>market</b> shares, and poor convergence of several state of the art solvers when computing point estimates. Both monomial rules and sparse grid methods lack these problems and provide a more accurate, cheaper method for quadrature. Finally, we demonstrate how researchers can easily utilize high quality, high dimensional quadrature rules in their own work...|$|R

This reconstructed active chromosome is then used to generate price forecasts. These forecasts are analyzed and compared to the standard ARIMA time-series forecasting method...|$|R
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsSean FoxThe {{commodity}} {{markets have}} seen {{a great deal of}} volatility over the past decade, which, for those involved, has created many challenges and opportunities. Some of those challenges and opportunities are related to the behavior of the basis – the difference between the local cash price of grain and its price in the futures market. This thesis examines factors impacting basis for corn and soybeans at an Illinois River barge terminal, inland grain terminals in central Illinois, and in the Decatur processing market. 	Factors used to explain basis behavior include the price level of futures markets, the price spread in the futures market, transportation cost, local demand conditions, and seasonal patterns. Using weekly data on basis from 2000 to 2013, regression models indicate that nearby corn futures, futures spread, <b>inverted</b> <b>market,</b> days until expiration, heating oil futures, and some months are significant drivers of corn basis. For inland terminals and processor regression models nearby corn futures do not appear to have significant effects.

40|$|As {{opposed to}} a normal market, an <b>inverted</b> <b>market</b> has a {{negative}} price of storage or spread. Market inversions in nearby spreads rarely occur during early months of the crop year since stocks are usually abundant after harvest. However, market inversions frequently occur when the spreads are observed across crop years {{near the end of}} the crop year. The regressions of spreads on the logarithm of U. S. quarterly stocks show that there exists a positive relationship between the spread and the level of stocks, and further implies that when stocks are scarce, markets will be inverted. Simulations are conducted to determine whether a market inversion is a signal to sell the stocks. The results of the paired-difference tests reveal that as the crop cycle advances towards the end of the crop year, market inversions clearly reflect the market's signal to release stocks in anticipation of new crop supplies. The regressions of actual returns to storage on predicted returns to storage clearly show that a market inversion is a signal to sell. The results support the behavioral finance hypothesis that producers are choosing to hold excess stocks because of some type of biased expectations. Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a framework for}} modeling defaultable debt under alternative recovery conventions (for a wide class of processes describing recovery rates and default probability). These debt models {{have the ability to}} differentiate the impact of recovery rates and default probability, and can be utilized to <b>invert</b> the <b>market</b> expectation of recovery rates implicit in bond prices. Among potential applications, the framework can be used for pricing and hedging credit derivatives that are contingent on the default event and/or recovery levels. Empirical implementation of these models suggests two central findings. First, the recovery concept that specifies recovery as a fraction of the discounted par value has broader empirical support. Second, parametric debt valuation models can provide a useful assessment of recovery rates embedded in bond prices. This article has attempted to model recovery and comprehend their impact on debt values. Credit; Risk; Econometric models...|$|R

Although asset return {{distributions}} {{are known}} to be conditionally leptokur-tic, this fact was rarely addressed in the recent GARCH model literature.

Our empirical results show that (1) the model’s perfor-mance in the objective as well as the risk-neutral world is substantially improved by allowing for non-Gaussian innovations and (2) the model’s best option pricing performance is achieved with a new estimation approach where all model param-eters are obtained from time-series information whereas the market price of risk and the spot variance are <b>inverted</b> from <b>market</b> prices of options. The failure to explain observed option prices is well-known for option pricing models which are solely based on time series information.

The {{data were collected from}} observation of olein price fluctuation in Jakarta Future Exchange. Fundamental analysis, technical analysis and basis were used to analyze the data. The patterns of olein price movement in future market which can be identified are double top (reversal pattern), uptrend and downtrend. Price fluctuation of domestic olein caused by bargaining aspect, namely supply through production and demand, covering: olein consumption, olein export, and olein stock. From technical analyze of exponential moving average (EMA) 5120, it can be used as an instrument to observe price trend, where volatility in JulyDecember is high risk, relative strength index (RSI) shows a position of over-sell, and moving average convergence devergence (MACD) shows a trend toward bearish, and more clearly result of the daily price during the next three months is obtained by predicting the price using autoregresive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method, and the result, the daily price of olein in next month trend to decrease.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the European Union strategy to secure competitiveness for Europe in the globalising world by focussing on technological supremacy (the Lisbon - agenda). Parallel to that, the EU Commission is trying {{to take a more}} economic approach to competition policy in general and anti-trust policy in particular. Our analysis tries to establish the relationship between increasing knowledge intensity and the resulting market concentration: if the European Union economy is gradually shifting to a pattern of sectoral specialisation that features a bias on knowledge intensive sectors, then this may well have some influence on market concentration and competition policy would have to adjust not to counterfeit the Lisbon-agenda. Following a review of the available theoretical and empirical literature on the relationship between knowledge intensity and market structure, we use a larger Eurostat database to test the shape of this relationship. Assuming a causality that runs from knowledge to concentration, we show that the relationship between knowledge intensity and market structures is in fact different for knowledge intensive industries and we establish a non-linear, <b>inverted</b> U-curve shape. <b>market</b> structure, knowledge intensity, competition policy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{the paper}} and {{literature}} addressed: The purpose {{of this research is}} to understand why early supplier integration in new product development repeatedly fails and how to select the right suppliers to avoid supplier obstructionism. We review the literature on early supplier integration. Research method: We conducted a consortial benchmarking study, involving seven firms as part of the research consortium and benchmarking visits to six best-practice firms. Research findings: Literature was distinguishing between operational and relational criteria explaining success (or failure) in buyer-supplier collaboration in innovation processes. Our research suggests that the direct relationship may be moderated by a strategic dimension. Missing buyer attractiveness for suppliers may be one additional explanation for the high rate of supplier obstructionism in such collaborations. As a consequence, a buying firm may want to become a preferred customer of its key suppliers. This can be achieved through concentration of the purchasing volume or selection of smaller suppliers. Main contribution: The notion of the buyer becoming a preferred customer of its suppliers effectively <b>inverts</b> the classical <b>marketing</b> approach. This change of perspective opens the avenue for a whole series of future inquiries, in particular answering the question on how to become a preferred customer...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} competition and R&D cooperation with universities and competitors. Our simple model predicts that more competitors reduce the incentives for horizontal cooperation as it diminishes the gains from “collusion”. Assuming {{that the value of}} synergies and spillovers created by cooperation depends on competition intensity reveals two distinct and opposing incentives for cooperation. While synergies foster R&D cooperation, spillovers may hinder cooperation. We mainly hypothesize that university cooperation corresponds to product innovation and hence quality competition, while horizontal cooperation lead to process innovations and therefore relates to price competition. We test these hypotheses based on Swiss firm-level panel data controlling for simultaneity of cooperation decisions and endogeneity of competition. Our empirical analysis supports the relevance of distinguishing between competition dimensions and cooperation partners, respectively. We find that price competition matters for both university and horizontal cooperation and it takes the form of an inverted U-shape. On the contrary, quality competition only matters for university cooperation and the relationship shows a U-form. Moreover we see that the number of principal competitors is significantly related only to cooperation between competitors and the relationship shows an <b>inverted</b> U-form. Hence, <b>markets</b> with a medium number of competitors are more receptive for horizontal cooperation. In sum these findings advance our understanding of the relationship between innovation and competition policy. innovation cooperation, university cooperation, horizontal cooperation, number of competitors, price competition, quality competition, synergy, knowledge spillover, collusion...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{study the}} effects of market power and {{financial}} constraints on arbitrage, liquidity provision, financial stability and welfare. In Chapter 1, I consider a dynamic model of imperfectly competitive arbitrage with time-varying supply. The model can explain the well-documented empirical features that (quasi) -identical assets can trade at significantly different prices; these price differences vanish slowly over time, resulting in apparently slow- moving capital; the price differences can <b>invert</b> over time; <b>market</b> depth is time-varying. I also show that entry does not necessarily correct these effects, although the mere threat of entry may improve liquidity. In Chapter 2, I introduce in the model the realistic feature that trading requires cap- ital and assume that arbitrageurs' positions must be fully collateralized, which rules out default. I compare liquidity provision, asset prices and welfare in the monopoly case to the perfect competition case studied by Gromb and Vayanos (2002). I show that relative to the competitive case, the monopoly is less efficient but also less capital-intensive, as rents captured over time allow her to build up capital. Consequently, when capital is scarce, financially-constrained competitive arbitrageurs may provide less liquidity at later stages than an unconstrained monopoly. In some cases, this increases aggregate welfare but with- out being Pareto-improving. I discuss implications for market-making via a specialist. In Chapter 3, I assume that some arbitrageurs have deeper pockets than others and allow for default. The capital-rich arbitrageurs (predators) either provide liquidity to other mar- ket participants (competitive hedgers) or engage in predatory trading against a financially- constrained peer (prey). In this strategy, predators depress the price of the asset to trigger a margin call on the prey's position and gain from her subsequent firesales. I show that the hedgers' reactions to the possibility of predation can make predatory trading cheaper, reducing the prey's staying power. In anticipation of the prey's firesales, hedgers may run on the asset, strengthening and to some extent substituting to the predators' price pressure. Further, their reaction leads to a reduction in the prey's price impact, which decreases her already limited ability to support the price and avoid a margin call. Predatory trading is likely to occur when hedgers are sufficiently risk-averse or the asset sufficiently risky...|$|R
