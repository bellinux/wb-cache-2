In {{order to}} improve the ability to predict the {{manufacturability}} of the <b>free-form</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the complexity of geometries for <b>free-form</b> <b>surfaces</b> is defined and studied. The <b>free-form</b> <b>surfaces</b> are modeled, {{which is used to}} calculate the distribution feature values of the surfaces. According to the feature values, <b>free-form</b> <b>surfaces</b> are classified into several clusters based on the fuzzy clustering algorithm. Group patterns are established according to feature values of the samples in the clusters. Then, the method of fuzzy pattern recognition is used to evaluate the surface complexity. The surface samples in the same cluster have close geometry configuration, so they often have similar manufacturing processes. A case study shows that the method can quickly classify the surfaces, largely reflecting the complexity of the <b>free-form</b> <b>surfaces,</b> which can lay the foundation for manufacturability evaluation of the complex surfaces...|$|R

Generating chopper gun trajectories for <b>free-form</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{to satisfy the}} given requirements is still highly challenging due to the complex geometry of <b>free-form</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the spray gun model. A CAD-guided chopper gun trajectory generation system for both uniform and nonuniform material distribution of <b>free-form</b> <b>surfaces</b> has been developed in our previous work. A material distribution model is also presented. To verify the developed algorithms, experiments were performed. In this paper, the experimental results are presented and compared with the simulation results. The results demonstrate that the developed trajectory generation system {{can be applied to}} generate trajectories for <b>free-form</b> <b>surfaces</b> such that the material distribution requirements can be satisfied. Also, the material distribution model can be used to compute the material distribution for <b>free-form</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This trajectory generation method can also be applied to generate trajectories for many other CAD-guided robot trajectory planning applications. © 2005 IEEE.

50|$|CAM {{software}} generally {{creates a}} tool path without considering any mechanics process. These causes risk of tool damage, tool deflection and errors on surface finish. By minimizing the forces we can increase tool life. Different optimization method {{can be used}} considering process parameters like feed rate, spindle speed, steps, tool diameter, magnitude and preset maximum force. The optimization can be done for minimum machining time, minimum tool travel, minimum production cost or for good surface finish. Efficiency of surface machined is also considered by maximum scallop height and by gouging. Gouging are {{the main reason for}} discrepancies of surface accuracy and texture specification. It also causes damage to part,s surface and machine tool. Scallop height tolerance help us in measuring the quality of <b>free-form</b> <b>surface.</b> Selection of proper topology result in minimum path length. In CAM software choosing NURBS to create surface is considered to be good method for presenting surface as it is accepted by both IGES and STEP files of CAM software.|$|E

40|$|Even {{though the}} speed of {{software}} ray tracing has recently been increased to interactive performance even on standard PCs, these systems usually only supported triangles as geometric primitives. Directly handling <b>free-form</b> <b>surfaces</b> such as spline or subdivision surfaces instead of first tessellating them offers many advantages such as higher precision results, reduced memory requirements, and faster preprocessing due to less primitives. However, existing algorithms for ray tracing <b>free-form</b> <b>surfaces</b> are much too slow for interactive use. In this paper we present a simple and generic approach for ray tracing <b>free-form</b> <b>surfaces</b> together with specific implementations for cubic Bézier and Loop subdivision surfaces. We show that our approach allows to increase the performance by more than an order of magnitude, requires only constant memory, and is largely independent on {{the total number of}} free-form primitives in a scene. Examples demonstrate that even scene with over one hundred thousand <b>free-form</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be rendered interactively on a single processor at video resolution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a reasonable method for generating the tool-path of <b>free-form</b> <b>surface</b> polishing using the fractal curves. <b>Free-form</b> <b>surface</b> polishing processes as a finishing process {{are used to}} reduce the roughness of surfaces and smooth the surface form by eliminating the surface waviness left by tool marks, EDM spark erosion and so on. In the interest of realizing this aim without introducing undesirable surface waviness and time efficiency, a tool-path should provide even coverage of <b>free-form</b> <b>surface</b> during polishing. A fractal curve is suitable to cover the <b>free-form</b> <b>surface</b> uniformly at any complexity due to its plane-filling and self-similar characteristics. A method of generating the fractal path for <b>free-form</b> <b>surface</b> polishing is presented, and also an automatic polishing system is installed to confirm the path planning method’s validity...|$|E

Automatic CAD-guided tool planning has many applications in surface manufacturing, such as spray painting, spray forming, rapid tooling, cleaning and polishing. According to the material quantity requirements, these tasks can be categorized into two groups: the material uniformity problem and coverage problem. A general framework is developed to automatically generate trajectories of a <b>free-form</b> <b>surface</b> for these tasks. A given task is first transformed {{into one of the}} groups. Based on the CAD model of a <b>free-form</b> <b>surface,</b> constraints and tool model, a trajectory for a <b>free-form</b> <b>surface</b> is generated. Velocity optimization is discussed to optimize the material quantity. Simulations are performed to verify the developed framework. This framework can also be extended to other applications.

It enables a low-pass description of the surface model, which is advantageously applied to the pose problem. To achieve the combination of such a signal-based model within the geometry of the pose scenario, the conformal geometric algebra is used and applied. ...|$|E

The overall goal of this research is the integration of geometric and mechanistic milling models for force prediction and feedrate scheduling for <b>free-form</b> <b>surface</b> machining. For each tool move a geometric model calculates the cutting geometry parameters, then a mechanistic model uses this information with the constraint force to calculate desired feedrates. The feedrate is written into the part program. When the integrated modeling approach was used, it was shown that the machining time can be decreased significantly along the tool path.
