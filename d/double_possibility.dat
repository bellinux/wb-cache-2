40|$|The {{development}} of new asymmetric methodologies that afford different structures in an enantioselective fashion {{is one of the}} most exciting goals for chemists nowadays. In this subject, lately, the use of sulfones has become a fast growing field. From the works of Tan and Shibata until the last works of Palomo, sulfones have demonstrated their versatility and power in organocatalytic asymmetric reactions. Moreover, the easy removal of sulfones with Mg or Hg/Na makes this group a perfect choice to afford easily naked alkyls. Remarkably, bissulfones can be used as nucleophiles or electrophiles, being vinyl sulfones excellent electrophiles, while bismethylensulfones derivatives such as fluoro are excellent nucleophiles. This <b>double</b> <b>possibility</b> has been studied by several research groups, leading to new methodologies that allow obtaining formally simple alkylation in an enantioselective fashion, by using organocatalysis. The aim of this tutorial review is to summarize the last trends in the use of sulfones in organocatalytic processes, giving a complete scenario of these new reagents...|$|E

40|$|Claire Blanche-Benveniste : « Three {{remarks on}} word order in spoken French » To study word order in spoken French, it is {{necessary}} to distinguish between two levels : 1 ° word order as actualised in the process of enunciation, with its repetitions and hesitations, 2 ° the grammatical order of phrases, which is an abstract reconstruction. Some types of phrase order are more frequent in spoken than in written French; this is the case of the structure in which a complement comes before its verb, which is particularly frequent in French in spite of what traditional French grammarians lead us to believe. In this position, the complement is strongly focalised and has particular semantic and syntactic properties which bring about a contrast with the phrase coming after the verb. French speakers often use this <b>double</b> <b>possibility</b> in the form of structural chiasmus. Blanche-Benveniste Claire. Trois remarques sur l'ordre des mots dans la langue parlée.

The present study investigated whether the cohabitants’ attachment style {{might be one of}} the reasons for cohabitation gaining such popularity. Attachment styles as well as socio-demographic variables were compared in regard to the partnership status. A sample of 1, 002 participants aged 18 to 60 were used as a representative sample (M = 43. 5, SD = 10. 9), of which 54 % were female and 82 % were married. The cohabitants were younger, more highly educated, and less frequently affiliated with a church. The cohabitants were more anxious-attached, especially those of a younger age. A one-point increase in value on the AAS anxiety scale almost <b>doubled</b> the <b>possibility</b> of cohabitation. Most of the variance can be explained by socio-demographic variables. However, based on these representative data, and after controlling for socio-demographic variables, attachment anxiety is still connected to cohabitation.

40|$|We propose {{and support}} the {{possibility}} that the shape of topological density 2 -point function in pure-glue QCD is crucially, and possibly entirely, determined by the space-time folding (geometry) of the double-sheet sign-coherent structure of Ref. [1], while the distribution of topological density within individual sheets only determines the overall magnitude of the correlator at finite physical distances. A specific manifestation of this, discussed here, is that the shape of the correlation function (encoding e. g. the masses of pseudoscalar glueballs) is reproduced upon the replacement q(x) -> sgn(q(x)), i. e. by considering the double sheet of the same space-time geometry but with constant magnitude of topological density. Combined with previous results on the fundamental topological structure, this suggests that a collective degree of freedom describing topological fluctuations of QCD vacuum {{can be viewed as a}} global space-filling homogeneous <b>double</b> membrane.

40|$|This article aims to {{demonstrate}} {{the hypothesis that the}} use of native culture (C 1) in EFL learners' dictionary definitions and/or examples is useful in the comprehension of the looked-up words. This is done by means of a survey involving more than 100 lower-intermediate EFL Catalan students. The subjects were first presented with a pre-test in which they had to translate 30 English words. Then they were divided into two groups, each of whom had to take a different test. Test 1 contained the definitions of the 30 words taken from a dictionary aimed at a global audience, whereas in test 2 the definitions were taken from a culturally nativized dictionary, that is, a dic­tionary that included C 1 elements. In the tests, the students were asked to translate again the 30 English headwords given in the pre-test. After comparing the results of the pre-test with those of the tests, the study concludes that students who use an EFL dictionary that includes C 1 references have more than <b>double</b> the <b>possibilities</b> of understanding the meaning of a new looked-up word than those who do not. The results obtained confirm {{for the first time in}} the field of pedagogical lexi­cography the tenets of schema theory, which highlights the importance of background (e. g. cul­tural) knowledge to improve reading comprehension. The main implication of this finding for lexi­cography is that it is desirable that designers of EFL dictionaries deploy nativized versions, espe­cially at lower levels, in order to facilitate comprehension of the foreign language...|$|R

30|$|A novel {{parallel}} {{hash function}} {{based on a}} high-dimensional chaotic map is proposed. In {{the core of the}} presented dynamical system lies interesting features such as invariant measure, ergodicity, bifurcation without period <b>doubling,</b> and the <b>possibility</b> of KS-entropy calculation [4]. By using significant properties of chaos and structure of the chaotic map, in the proposed algorithm, the message is totally connected to all parameters, so this structure can ensure the uniform sensitivity of hash value to the message. Since the coupled architecture is a complex chaotic system, it is very difficult or even impossible to predict its time series. Therefore, the complexity and nonlinearity of the chaotic map yield strong bit confusion and diffusion with the low expense of floating-point computations. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation indicate that the proposed new scheme achieves several desirable features such as high flexibility, good statistical properties, parallel implementation, high key sensitivity, and message sensitivity. Moreover, it resists linear analysis, exhaustive key search, and statistical attack. It can be concluded that the proposed algorithm fulfills the performance requirements of hash function and that it is practical and reliable, with high potential to be adopted in real-world applications.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} study on {{scattering}} of 100 – 1400 eV Ne+ ions off Mg, Al, Si, and P surfaces. Exit energy distributions and yields of single-scattered Ne+ and Ne 2 + were separately measured to investigate charge exchange mechanisms occurring {{at the onset of}} inelastic losses in binary hard collision events. At low incident energies, collisions appear elastic and projectile ion survival is dominated by nonlocal Auger-type neutralization involving the target valence band. However, once a critical Rmin (distance of closest approach) is reached, three phenomena occur simultaneously: Ne 2 + generation, reversal of the Ne+ yield trend, and inelastic losses in Ne+ and Ne 2 +. Rmin values for the Ne 2 + turn-on agree very well with the L-shell overlap distances of the colliding partners, suggesting that electron transfer involving the highly promoted 4 fsigma molecular orbital (correlated to the Ne 2 p) at close internuclear distance (~ 0. 5 Å) is responsible. For the Ne+ yield, a clear transition from nonlocal neutralization to Rmin-dependent collision induced neutralization was observed. Binary collision inelasticities (Qbin) were evaluated for Ne+ and Ne 2 + off Al and Si by taking into account electron straggling. Saturation-like behavior at Rmin Ne** (2 p 43 s 2, 41 – 45 eV) and Ne+ [...] >Ne+** (2 p 33 s 2 / 3 s 3 p, 69 – 72 eV), followed by autoionization as the projectile leaves the surface region to give Ne+ and Ne 2 +. In contrast, Qbin values for Ne 2 + at the + 2 turn-on were seen much lower (35 – 40 eV off Al, 55 – 60 eV off Si) than that required for <b>double</b> promotion—eliminating the <b>possibility</b> that Ne 2 + is only generated in double excitation of surviving Ne+. Thus single-electron excitation appears to be more important in the threshold region compared to the two-electron events seen at higher collision energies. In addition, the Ne+[Single Bond]P system shows striking similarities with the other target cases {{from the perspective of a}} well-defined Ne 2 + turn-on, continually increasing Ne 2 + yield with impact energy, and inelasticity values which point to the same 4 fsigma excitation pathway. The decreasing Rmin requirement for higher target Z in terms of Ne 2 + production has been confirmed for the Mg through P series, where hard collision excitation is governed by L-shell orbital overlaps...|$|R
