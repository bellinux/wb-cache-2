2500|$|Business service {{bonds are}} surety bonds which seek to {{safeguard}} a bonded entity's clients from theft. These bonds are common for home health care, janitorial service, {{and other companies}} who routinely enter their homes or businesses. [...] While these bonds are often confused with fidelity bonds, they are much different. [...] A business service bond allows the bonded entity's client to claim on the surety bond when the client's property has been stolen by the bonded entity. [...] However, the claim is only valid if the bonded entity's employee is convicted of the crime {{in a court of}} law. [...] Additionally, if the surety company pays a claim on the bond, they would seek to be reimbursed by the bonded entity for all costs and expenses incurred {{as a result of the}} claim. [...] This differs from a traditional <b>fidelity</b> <b>bond</b> where the insured (bonded entity) would be responsible for paying the deductible only in the case of covered claim up to the policy limit.|$|E

During the last several years, this position has been modified somewhat as underwriters have recog-nized the increasing similarities between <b>fidelity</b> <b>bonding</b> and casualty insurance; the rate structure+, however, has yet to reflect the shift of opinion. The replacement of Individual and schedule bonds by blanket coverages, particularly in the bank and commerical fields, with the accompanying shift in underwriting attention from the principal to the obligee, is probably the fundamental cause of this change in posi-tion, but there have been other more direct pressures towards statis-tically sounder fidelity rates.

A <b>fidelity</b> <b>bond</b> generally covers a corporate policyholder from first party losses arising from the theft of money, securities or other tangible property so if the portal's employees steal the funds belonging to the crowdfunding company, the bond can be useful.

40|$|Key Words <b>fidelity,</b> {{hydrogen}} <b>bond,</b> hydrophobic effects, base stacking, solvation, sterics f Abstract Various physicochemical factors influence DNA replication fidelity. Since it is {{now known}} that Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds are not necessary for efficient and selective replication of a base pair by DNA polymerase enzymes, a number of alternative physical factors have been examined to explain the efficiency of these enzymes. Among these factors are minor groove hydrogen bonding, base stacking, solvation, and steric effects. We discuss the concept of active site tightness in DNA polymerases, and consider how it might influence steric (size and shape) effects of nucleotide selection in synthesis of a base pair. A high level of active site tightness is expected to lead to higher fidelity relative to proteins with looser active sites. We review the current data on what parts and dimensions of active sites are most affected by size and shape, based on data with modified nucleotides that have been examined as polymerase substrates. We also discuss recent data on nucleotide analogs displaying higher fidelity than the natural ones. The published data ar...|$|R

40|$|The base pairs {{in double}} helical nucleic acids have been {{compared}} {{to see how they}} can be recognized by proteins. We conclude that a single hydrogen bond is inadequate for uniquely identifying any particular base pair, as this leads to numerous degeneracies. However, using two hydrogen <b>bonds,</b> <b>fidelity</b> of base pair recognition may be achieved. We propose specific amino-acid side chain interactions involving two hydrogen bonds as a component of the recognition system for base pairs. In the major groove we suggest that asparagine or glutamine binds to adenine of the base pair or arginine binds to guanine. In the minor groove, we suggest an interaction between asparagine or glutamine with guanine of the base pair. We also discuss the role that ions and other amino-acid side chains may play in recognition interactions...|$|R
