5|$|Subfamilies exhibit {{different}} feeding strategies. While Bovinae species graze <b>extensively</b> <b>on</b> fresh {{grass and}} diffused forage, Cephalophinae species (with {{the exception of}} Sylvicapra) primarily consume fruits. Reduncinae and Hippotraginae species depend on unstable food sources, but the latter are specially adapted to arid areas. Members of Caprinae, being flexible feeders, forage even in areas with low productivity. Tribes Alcelaphini, Hippotragini, and Reduncini have high proportions of monocots in their diets. On the contrary, Tragelaphini and Neotragini (with the exception of Ourebia) feed <b>extensively</b> <b>on</b> dicots. No conspicuous relationship exists between body size and consumption of monocots.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Bute {{asked his}} chief Cardiff engineer, John McConnochie, to {{excavate}} and clear the castle ruins.

Burges's lavishly illustrated report, which drew <b>extensively</b> <b>on</b> Clark's earlier work, laid out two options: either conserve the ruins or rebuild the castle to create a house for occasional occupation in the summer. On receipt of the report, Bute commissioned Burges to rebuild Castle Coch in a Gothic Revival style.|$|E
