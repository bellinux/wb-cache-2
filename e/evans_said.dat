25|$|On 6 January 2014, Total Film {{reported}} that The Raid 3 {{will take place}} {{two hours before the}} end of The Raid 2. On 19 April 2014, during an interview with Metro, director <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> that he is planning to take a break from martial arts movies {{for two or three years}} before filming it. The Raid 3 was planned for a 2018 or 2019 release.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1959 Scott LaFaro, who {{was playing}} {{up the street}} from <b>Evans,</b> <b>said</b> he was {{interested}} in developing a trio. LaFaro suggested Paul Motian, who had already appeared in some of Evans' first solo albums, as the drummer for the new band. The trio with LaFaro and Motian {{became one of the most}} celebrated piano trios in jazz. With this group Evans' focus settled on traditional jazz standards and original compositions, with an added emphasis on interplay among band members. Evans and LaFaro would achieve a high level of musical empathy. In December 1959 the band recorded its first album, Portrait in Jazz for Riverside Records.|$|E
25|$|Following two {{high-profile}} shows which {{failed to}} perform in the ratings, UMTV hired Terry Wogan and Evans' former Big Breakfast co-host Gaby Roslin to host a weekday morning magazine show, The Terry and Gaby Show. <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> publicly that if this show failed he would set up a market stall. Despite critical acclaim the audience numbers never took off and Channel 5 axed the show after its year-long run, citing its high cost as a reason. True to his word, Evans was pictured {{at the end of}} the final show with a market stall and later he opened it for real at Stables Market, Camden.|$|E
5000|$|Eliminated - Team Red (Will Wikle, Tina, Gervase, Coral, Melissa, Evan) were eliminated. <b>Evan</b> <b>said</b> {{afterwards}} {{he preferred}} losing without Adam to winning with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{the best}} fellow that ever lived," [...] <b>Evan</b> <b>said,</b> as Harry turned {{away with a}} {{friendly}} nod. [...] "Upon my word, I'm quite ashamed of the use I make of your husband's stables, Edie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] <b>Evan</b> <b>said,</b> with a {{satisfied}} air, [...] "and {{a good job}} too; mother always will have my clothes so big, cos of my growing. She always seems to think one will grow sudden into a man afore one's things wear out." ...|$|R
500|$|In a brief dissent, Evans {{argued that}} Oppenheimer's {{security}} clearance should be reinstated. He {{pointed out that}} most of the AEC charges had been {{in the hands of the}} AEC when it cleared Oppenheimer in 1947, and that [...] "to deny him clearance now for what he was cleared for in 1947, when we must know he is less of a security risk now than he was then, seems to be hardly the procedure to be adopted in a free country." [...] <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> that his association with Chevalier did not indicate disloyalty, and that he did not hinder development of the H-bomb. <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> he personally thought that [...] "our failure to clear Dr. Oppenheimer will be a black mark on the escutcheon of our country," [...] and expressed concern about the effect an improper decision might have on the country's scientific development.|$|E
500|$|International Master Anthony Saidy {{recalled}} his last round {{encounter with the}} undefeated Fischer:Going into the final game I certainly {{did not expect to}} upset Fischer. I hardly knew the opening but played simply, and he went along with the scenario, opting for a N-v-B [...] endgame with a minimal edge. In the corridor, <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> to me, 'Good. Show him we're not all children.' ...|$|E
500|$|In 1864, Evans married Mary Spence Brown, Foster's niece, and {{the couple}} lived in Witley, Surrey. Foster was their neighbour, as was George Eliot. Commenting on his work, <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> that it [...] "kept me fully {{employed}} mind and body: I had to direct the engravers to {{the direction of the}} lines in the colour blocks, and the printers for the tones of the inks for printing, often mixing the inks". Whenever possible he visited Brighton, where he enjoyed the air.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you please, sir," [...] <b>Evan</b> <b>said,</b> {{running up}} to one of the racquet-players, [...] "there is just a row going on; they are all {{pitching}} into the scholars on their way back from Vincent Square, and if you don't send help they will get it nicely, though they are all fighting like bricks." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked about}} being posted to Turkey, <b>Evans</b> jokingly <b>said,</b> [...] "I am {{more of a}} chicken man".|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are such}} {{lots of things}} I should like to buy," [...] <b>Evan</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I should like to buy mother a new Sunday bonnet, and I should like {{to get you a}} pound of bacca; and Winnie wants a new pair of boots and stockings, and there's lots of things I should like to get for Harry, and some warm gloves for Sue, and--and no end of things." ...|$|R
500|$|MusicOMH {{reviewer}} Simon <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> Powderfinger added [...] "a real {{punch to}} songs...far removed from your standard {{rock and roll}} fare" [...] in Vulture Street, praising the emotion and seriousness of [...] "Since You've Been Gone" [...] and [...] "How Far Have We Really Come?", and the [...] "fun" [...] in [...] "Don't Panic". Evans praised producer Nick DiDia {{for his work on}} the album, which he summarised as [...] "a quantum leap from its rather passionless predecessor, Odyssey Number Five".|$|E
500|$|The {{match is}} {{considered}} to be the best Premier League game {{in the history of the}} competition. Newcastle's manager Kevin Keegan described it as a [...] "classic", while Liverpool manager Roy <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> [...] "the entertainment value was up there with the best". In 2003, the game was awarded the Match of the Decade award on behalf of the Premier League, which was celebrating its tenth anniversary. The result influenced the league championship; the leaders Manchester United lost only one more match that season and retained the title.|$|E
500|$|In July 1966, The Beatles {{toured the}} Philippines, and unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos. After the {{supposed}} snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage {{had to make}} their way to Manila airport on their own. At the airport, road manager Evans was beaten and kicked, and the group members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. Once the group boarded the plane, Tony Barrow and Evans were ordered off, and <b>Evans</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Tell Lil I love her," [...] thinking he was about to be jailed or killed. Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the group had earned while they were there before being allowed on the plane.|$|E
60|$|The {{brilliant}} light {{ran along}} the blades, filling the channels of them with white fire; the combatants stuck their swords in the turf and took off their hats, coats, waistcoats, and boots. <b>Evan</b> <b>said</b> a short Latin prayer to himself, during which Turnbull made something of a parade of lighting a cigarette which he flung away the instant after, when he saw MacIan apparently standing ready. Yet MacIan was not exactly ready. He stood staring like a man stricken with a trance.|$|R
50|$|<b>Evans</b> Partnership <b>said</b> it {{intended}} {{to build an}} 11-story, 460000 sq ft office building. It hired architect Arthur May of the firm of Kohn Pedersen Fox to design the structure.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the future}} of the band, <b>Evan</b> Sammons <b>said</b> in July 2016, [...] "There's no {{timeline}} for it, but it's been no secret that we plan to make another record." ...|$|R
500|$|Brodie plays as a striker and was {{described}} by the Times & Star as a [...] "prolific" [...] goalscorer. After making his debut for York in February 2007, Dave Flett of The Press said Brodie [...] "looks a potent package of pace and power with a competitive streak that should strike fear into countless Conference defenders". Foyle's guidance while manager at York was credited as benefiting Brodie. He stated [...] "I've worked hard trying to improve my game and I'm starting to score different types of goals" [...] in December 2009. He {{was described}} by the Huddersfield Daily Examiner as [...] "one of non-league football's hottest properties" [...] in January 2010. After signing for Crawley in August 2010, manager <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> [...] "The lad is a terrific player, he works very hard for the team and gets a goal".|$|E
500|$|The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's {{first ever}} {{win in a}} medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women, and it still remains {{the only time that}} the United States did not win the men's event. After the race, the team made a celebratory dive into the water and {{performed}} a poolside interview. Tonelli remarked that [...] "I was totally stunned. After all the hassle, and my being the athletes' mouthpiece, we'd come through and done it". Australia's women's captain Lisa Forrest hailed the win as [...] "a gold medal that should never have been". <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> of the relay, [...] "It was unbelievable, but it was all so logical. I was so deliriously happy that I couldn't stop talking," [...] as Brooks dedicated his win to his mother, who had died from cancer the previous Christmas.|$|E
500|$|Evans {{was active}} in the finale of the first road race stage. Almost {{completely}} flat with a punchy uphill finish, the stage kept the peloton together most of the way before a crash [...] from the end split the field. Evans stayed out front and shadowed Philippe Gilbert on the finish atop the Mont des Alouettes. The Belgian won the stage, but Evans finished clear of the peloton for second place three seconds back. This positioned the team well for the stage 2 team time trial. Despite being considered the lesser of squads such as , , and , among others, the squad finished second just four seconds back of , tied with [...] and [...] The result left [...] riders Thor Hushovd and David Millar tied on the same time {{at the top of the}} overall classification, with the Norwegian taking the yellow jersey, and Evans installed into third overall just a single second back. <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> after the stage that he was very pleased with the team's effort and had confidence for the continuation of the race.|$|E
6000|$|<b>EVAN.</b> Then <b>said</b> Evangelist, How hath it fared with you, my friends, {{since the}} time of our last parting? What have you met with, and how have you behaved yourselves? ...|$|R
6000|$|Evan Meredith {{noticed the}} change as well. He and Harry had grown now into real friends. Harry saw and {{recognized}} the genuine depth of Evan's nature. Evan had made amends and apologies to Harry {{for a single}} passing rudeness or two. Both liked the other better for the momentary rivalry and {{for the way he}} had soon forgotten it. [...] "He's a good fellow," [...] <b>Evan</b> <b>said</b> to his father often, [...] "and Edie, with her quiet, simple English nature, has made quite another man of him--given him the ballast and the even steadiness he once wanted." ...|$|R
6000|$|As he spoke, three solemn footmen {{came out}} of the lodge gate and {{assembled}} to assist the chauffeur to his room. The mere sight of them made the two wanderers flee as from a too frightful incongruity, and before they knew where they were, they were well upon the grassy ledge of England that overlooks the Channel. <b>Evan</b> <b>said</b> suddenly: [...] "Will they let me see her in heaven once in a thousand ages?" [...] and addressed the remark to the editor of The Atheist, as on which he would be likely or qualified to answer. But no answer came; a silence sank between the two.|$|R
500|$|Reaction to {{the release}} was [...] "generally ecstatic", {{according}} to MacDonald, with listeners marvelling at the album's [...] "aural invention". To the Beatles' less progressive fans, however, the radical changes in the band's sound were the source of confusion. The editor of the Australian teen magazine Mirabelle wrote: [...] "Everyone, from Brisbane to Bootle, hates that daft song Lennon sang {{at the end of}} Revolver." [...] In his review for the NME, Allen <b>Evans</b> <b>said,</b> in response to the lyric's exhortation to [...] "relax and float downstream": [...] "But how can you relax with the electronic, outer-space noises, often sounding like seagulls? … Only Ringo's rock-steady drumming is natural." [...] Peter Jones of Record Mirror commented: [...] "You need some sort of aural microscope to get the message from this. But it's darned compelling listening." [...] Writing in 1977, author Nicholas Schaffner said that those who had been confused by the lyrics were most likely unfamiliar with hallucinogenic drugs and Timothy Leary's message, but that the transcendental quality became clear during the build-up to the 1967 Summer of Love.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his newfound}} top {{prospect}} status Houtteman remained in Buffalo {{at the beginning}} of the 1947 season before being recalled to the Tigers in July. He was relegated to the bullpen for a time, and saw little action. But after Hal Newhouser, Fred Hutchinson and Dizzy Trout were used in two days, Tiger manager Steve O'Neill decided to start Houtteman against the Washington Senators for only the second start of his career. He tossed a five-hit shutout and Tiger general manager Billy <b>Evans</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "In 40years I've never seen a better pitching job by a first-year pitcher. We now know that Houtteman is really a big leaguer". He followed this with another five-hit victory against the Boston Red Sox, then pitched a three-hit shutout in September against the St. Louis Browns. He finished the season at 7–2 with a 3.42 ERA, seven complete games and two shutouts. His performance in 1947 caught the attention of New York Yankees star and future Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio, who said of Houtteman and Bob Lemon, [...] "They have more stuff and more pitching sense than any other young fellows I've seen come up in a long while".|$|E
500|$|Attention also {{focused on}} Jaguar's {{improved}} pace during the event. Prior to the race, {{the team had}} been criticised by the media {{for their ability to}} perform well in the series with some publications criticising their move of signing Evans and Carroll to drive their cars. <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> his improved performance encouraged everyone working for the team and it gave Jaguar more confidence: [...] "If you look at the bigger picture, I’ve got to be satisfied with today. Qualifying was great, to be honest, I topped the group. If you ask me or the whole team if this would have happened after Marrakesh, we would have taken it with both hands." [...] Carroll hoped he would have a strong performance in the event and be faster than he could be but it was an issue that could be improved on. Jaguar team principal James Barclay stated the improvement was [...] "a little bit of a positive surprise" [...] but was unsure if Carroll's problem {{at the start of the}} race was caused by driver error or an electrical issue but admitted his team had to improve their understanding of full course yellow in future races.|$|E
2500|$|In {{reaction}} to the racial incidents, <b>Evan</b> Wolfson <b>said,</b> [...] "In any fight, there will be people who say things they shouldn't say, but that shouldn't divert attention from what the vast majority are saying against this, that it's a terrible injustice." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Evans</b> {{initially}} <b>said</b> {{that the}} Philippine government couldn't {{be blamed for}} the incident. He later said that Jacqueline Hamill may {{have been killed by}} a sniper from the military following a finding by the Davao Doctors Hospital contrary to earlier reports that she was killed by slashed throat.|$|R
50|$|<b>Evans</b> was <b>said</b> to be {{a friend}} of the Prime Minister W E Gladstone and seems to have been drawn into {{politics}} through that acquaintanceship. He was first returned to Parliament at a by-election in May 1888 as one of the two members of parliament (MP) for Southampton.|$|R
500|$|Storm of Zehirs storyline occurs {{concurrently}} with Mask of the Betrayer, {{which was}} set in the Rashemen region of Faerûn. The story was shaped by lead designer Tony Evans and written by Obsidian designer Annie Carlson. [...] The team leads decided to create an adventure that they considered {{more in line with}} the roots of Dungeons & Dragons by departing from the more serious, epic stories presented in Neverwinter Nights 2 and Mask of the Betrayer. <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> [...] "This direction for the title can be seen throughout - finding random (and not random) goodies while searching the overland map, the addition of the Swashbuckler class, the variety of personalities in the cohorts..." [...] The game's music was composed with this in mind; Evans wanted themes that would portray the feel of a [...] "light-hearted adventure". Audio director Alexander Brandon collaborated with composers of games like the Heroes of Might and Magic series and Primal, as well as [...] "rookie composers" [...] from Rogue Dao Studios. Brandon had the option of using a live orchestra, but decided against it to include more music in the game.|$|E
500|$|Nimoy {{approached}} ILM {{early in}} development and helped create storyboards for the optical effects sequences. Many shots used matte paintings to extend backgrounds and create establishing shots without {{the cost of}} building a set. Matte supervisor Chris Evans attempted to create paintings that felt less contrived and more real—while the natural instinct of filmmaking is to place important elements in an orderly fashion, <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> that photographers would [...] "shoot things that [...] are odd in some way" [...] and end up with results that look natural instead. The task of establishing the location and atmosphere at Starfleet Headquarters fell to the matte department, who had to make it feel like a bustling futuristic version of San Francisco. The matte personnel and Ralph McQuarrie provided design input. The designers decided to make actors in the foreground more prominent, and filmed them on a large area of smooth concrete runway at the Oakland Airport. Elements like a shuttlecraft that thirty extras appeared to interact with were also mattes blended to appear as if they were sitting by the actors. Ultimately the artists were not satisfied with how the shot turned out; matte photography supervisor Craig Barron believed that there were too many elements in the scene.|$|E
500|$|Harvey then {{returned}} to Headingley, the venue of his famous innings five years earlier. In a low-scoring match, he top-scored for the entire match with 71 in the first innings as Australia took a 99-run lead. The tourists looked set for victory and retention of The Ashes {{at the start of}} the final day, but time-wasting and defiant defence from the English batsmen left Australia a target of 177 in the last two hours. This would have required a scoring rate much higher than in the first four days of the match. Harvey quickly scored 34 at a run a minute, and Australia had made 111 in 75 minutes and were on schedule for a win. At that point, English medium-pacer Trevor Bailey began bowling with the wicket-keeper more than two metres down the leg side to deny the Australians an opportunity to hit the ball, but the umpires did not penalise them as wides. The match ended in a draw, and Harvey described Bailey's tactics as [...] "absolutely disgusting". English wicket-keeper Godfrey <b>Evans</b> <b>said</b> that the tourists [...] "were absolutely livid" [...] and he sympathised with them, saying that [...] "they were right" [...] in claiming that Bailey's bowling was [...] "the worst kind of negative cricket" [...] and that he had [...] "cheated [...] of victory".|$|E
5000|$|... 'Another intrusion' was a gynaecological {{examination}} {{conducted by}} a Dr Penfold, which caused Evans to 'cry and scream' when the speculum was used, and resulted in a finding that he was 'physiologically female' and 'had carried and borne a child'. <b>Evans</b> later <b>said</b> the 'examination had injured' him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is not,' <b>said</b> <b>Evan,</b> imperiously. 'Do {{you think}} he would come to meet a Sassenach duinhe-wassel {{in such a way as}} that?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We quarrelled," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Evan,</b> in {{the same}} dead voice, [...] "about religion." [...] The fat shopkeeper rolled about in his chair with enjoyment.|$|R
