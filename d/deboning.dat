40|$|Market trends have {{dictated}} that broilers be reared for divergent market demands for decades. Also, broiler genetic strains have been adapted to meet market demands which include: genetic selection for improved breast meat, {{the practice of}} growing birds to older ages and greater market weights to meet demands, and decreasing postmortem (PM) aging time to improve processing efficiency and fillet yield. These production practices can also affect product quality, specifically boneless breast fillet tenderness and water-holding capacity. To address these factors, a series of experiments were conducted {{to determine the effect}} of strain and slaughter age on meat quality parameters, as well as potential causes of these differences in meat quality. Furthermore, commonly accepted methods for improving boneless breast fillet meat quality were evaluated for the effect of older slaughter age and greater market weights. Based on these results, it appears that, regardless of <b>debone</b> time, broilers reared to greater market weights are tougher than birds reared to a lighter market weight. There are several factors that are compounding this increased toughness, including slower progression of rigor development, greater myofibrillar diameter, and perhaps decreased PM fragmentation; however, the relationship among factors is not fully exploited. Also, it appears that boneless breast fillet marination is critical in these larger birds to alleviate the toughness associated with pre-rigor <b>debone,</b> and may be necessary even when birds are deboned at 24 h PM. Therefore, based on these results it can be recommended that longer PM aging prior to <b>debone</b> is necessary when birds are slaughtered at heavier market weights, and aging the meat off the bone may be beneficial to improving boneless breast fillet tenderness. Furthermore, the commercial practice of tumble-marinating is effective for breast fillets of greater size and may be necessary to avoid negative consumer perception of tenderness...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} different <b>deboning</b> times {{on the quality of}} broiler breast meat. Seventy-two broiler breasts were evaluated. They were distributed in a completely randomized experimental design, with six treatments, six repetitions and two birds per parcel. The treatments were denominated as follows: A - <b>deboning</b> immediately after chilling, B - <b>deboning</b> 1 h after chilling, C - <b>deboning</b> 2 h after chilling, D - <b>deboning</b> 3 h after chilling, E - <b>deboning</b> 4 h after chilling, and F - <b>deboning</b> 24 hours after chilling. Lowest pH values (p< 0. 05) were seen when <b>deboning</b> was performed 24 h after carcass chilling (pH= 6. 00) in comparison to <b>deboning</b> at 0 h (6. 69) and 1 h (6. 42) after chilling. R values were inversely proportional to pH values, i. e., R values were lower (p< 0. 05) in treatments A (1. 05) and B (1. 07) when compared to treatment F (1. 44). No differences were seen in cooking loss during thermal treatment (broiling) of the muscle P. major.

40|$|The {{flavor and}} texture of the final meat, poultry, or game product depends on how the meat is handled {{following}} slaughter. If you slaughter your own meat, contact your county Extension educator for information. Use only meat from healthy, disease-free animals.

Meat, poultry, and game are low-acid foods and must be processed in a pressure canner at 10 to 15 pounds of pressure per square inch (psi) for safety. See Tables 1, 2, and 3 for processing times for all meat types and stock. Meat can be packed either raw or cooked. Pack meat loosely into clean canning jars.

When ready to serve, boil canned meat and poultry 10 minutes before you taste it—even if it looks and smells all right. If {{this is your first}} time canning, it is suggested that you read “Canning Basics ” for instructions on filling and processing recommendations. Poultry, Rabbit, or Squirrel Choose freshly killed and dressed, healthy animals. Large chickens are more flavorful than fryers. Dressed poultry should be chilled for 6 to 12 hours before canning.

In the course of the study, the time allowed for aging prior to <b>deboning</b> of the breast meat was decreased from 4 h to 2 h post-mortem, and the effect on tenderness was determined.
