5|$|With Twitter, it wasn't {{clear what}} it was. They {{called it a}} social network, they called it microblogging, {{but it was hard}} to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of {{discovery}} with something like that, where over time you <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.|$|E

5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and {{her mother}} visit her brother Bill and his {{pregnant}} wife Tara around Christmas time. Scully answers the phone, and {{the person on the}} other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego where a group of cops are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made.

5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try and <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones {{and not have to}} deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E

When Ash goes to check on Linda, he is horrified to find that she has already begun to turn. A badly-injured Scotty {{staggers}} into the cabin and dies of his wounds, having been attacked by the trees. While Ash tries to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> to do, both Linda and Cheryl pretend to be cured, only to quickly revert to their demonic forms. Ash locks Linda outside, but she returns and tries to stab him before he impales her with a dagger. He tries to cut up her remains with a chainsaw, but can't bring himself to do so, and ends up burying her instead. When he reaches for her necklace on the ground, she escapes again trying to kill him. Ash decapitates her with a shovel, and her headless body bleeds all over Ash's face as it tries to rape him before he escapes. Back in the cabin, he quickly realizes that Cheryl has forced open the trapdoor. After wounding her with a shotgun, he heads to the basement for more ammunition.

5|$|The {{employees}} pursue Michael, and {{he confesses}} that {{he created the}} rumors to conceal the one true rumor. Andy fears {{that it might be}} the one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is about to give in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's ultrasound picture to prove it. Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. He picks up the phone with the intention of making an excuse for his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim hangs up the phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia is enough for her to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> is going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his office window as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a tire iron in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they essentially reveal was nothing.|$|E
