40|$|Slamming often {{occurs in}} severe sea states {{particular}} for high speed vessels, {{which can cause}} <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>ship</b> hulls or even equipment on ships. Analysis of transient dynamic response of ship hulls is useful in establishing criterion related to slamming loads and predicting seakeeping behavior of the ship. Thus this thesis is mainly focused on dynamic response of the ship due to slamming loads. Experimental study of the floating structure dynamics can be very expensive. Hence, numerical methods {{are considered to be}} very useful for dynamic analysis of the ship. The ship to be analyzed in this work is owned by Wagenborg which is a multi-purpose cargo/container ship. The bench mark committee has provided all the information about the ship and corresponding sea condition. Three-dimensional finite element model is established in Sesam Genie. Hydrodynamic coefficients are computed in Sesam HydroD. The model made in Genie is imported in ABAQUS for dynamic analysis. The material properties, sections, mesh size and load cases are defined in ABAQUS. The introductory part of this thesis gives an overview of slamming phenomenon and reviews of previous literature. The second part of the thesis introduces different types of external loads which act on the ship hull and the response induced by these loads. Slamming load theories are described especially. The third part elaborates dynamic response analysis theories and corresponding analysis methods. The analysis methods used in ANAQUS are also specified in this section. The forth part of the thesis presents details of the finite element modelling of the ship using software Sesam and ABAQUS. Different ship models are established for comparison. The final part presents the results of eigenvalue analysis and dynamic response analysis. Parametric studies are performed in this section. The conclusions are made in the final part...|$|E

40|$|Noise and {{vibration}} {{in complex}} ship structures {{are becoming a}} prominent issue for ship building industry and ship companies due to the constant demand of building faster ships of lighter weight, and the stringent noise and libration regulation of the industry. In order to retain the full benefit of building faster ships without compromising too much on ride comfort and safety, noise and vibration control needs to be implemented. Due {{to the complexity of}} ship structures, the coupling of different wave types and multiple wave propagation paths, active control of global hull modes is difficult to implement and very expensive. Traditional passive control such as adding damping materials is only effective in the high frequency range. However, most severe <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>ship</b> structures is caused by large structural deformation of hull structures and high dynamic stress concentration at low frequencies. The most discomfort and fatigue of passengers and the crew onboard ships is also due to the low frequency noise and vibration. Innovative approaches are therefore, required to attenuate the noise and vibration at low frequencies. This book was developed from several specialized research topics on vibration and vibration control of ship structures, mostly from the author's own PhD work at the University of Western Australia. The book aims to provide a better understanding of vibration characteristics of ribbed plate structures, plate/plate coupled structures and the mechanism governing wave propagation and attenuation in periodic and irregular ribbed structures as well as in complex ship structures. The book is designed to be a reference book for ship builders, vibro-acoustic engineers and researchers. The author also hopes that the book can stimulate more exciting future work in this area of research. It is the author's humble desire that the book can be some use for those who purchase it. This book is divided into eight chapters. Each chapter focuses on providing solution to address a particular issue on vibration problems of ship structures. A brief summary of each chapter is given in the general introduction. All chapters are inter-dependent to each other to form an integration volume on the subject of vibration and vibration control of ship structures and alike. I am in debt to many people in completing this work. In particular, I would like to thank Professor J. Pan, Dr N. H. Farag, Dr K. Sum and many others from the University of Western Australia for useful advices and helps during my times at the University and beyond. I {{would also like to thank}} my wife, Miaoling Wang, my children, Anita, Sophia and Angela Lin, for their sacrifice and continuing supports to make this work possible.
