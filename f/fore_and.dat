5|$|Both ships {{underwent}} extensive refits {{near the}} end or after the war. North Carolina received a secondary air search set (SR) and a SCR-720 zenith search radar on the forward funnel. At {{the end of the}} war, it had an SP surface-search, a SK-2 air-search, a Mark 38 main battery fire control system with Mark 13 and 27 radars, a Mark 37 secondary battery fire control system with Mark 12, 22 and 32 radars, and a Mark 57 smaller weaponry fire control system, with a Mark 34 radar. In March 1946, Washington had a SK <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> a SR aft, a SG both <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> aft, and a TDY jammer (which could scramble radar on other ships).|$|E
5|$|The ships mounted four 10-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns in twin-gun turrets <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> aft of the superstructure. The guns could fire both solid {{shot and}} {{explosive}} shells. They were mounted on carriages that used hydraulic jacks to elevate and depress the guns.|$|E

5|$|A {{rangefinder}} {{was installed}} on the bridge and her <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> aft holds were refitted as magazines. Half-inch (12.7mm) steel plating was added to protect her steering gear and her interior cabin bulkheads and glass ventilators were removed to reduce damage from splinters. Her furniture was removed {{to make room for}} the mess decks needed to feed large numbers of troops and sailors and an operating room and sickbay were installed amidships.|$|E
5|$|Canada was {{transferred}} to the 1st Battle Squadron on 12 June 1916. In 1917–18, she was fitted with better rangefinders and range dials, and two of the aft 6-inch secondary guns were removed after they suffered blast damage from the middle 14-inch turret. In the latter year, flying-off platforms for aircraft were added atop the superfiring turrets <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> aft. Canada was put into the reserve fleet in March 1919.|$|E
5|$|Four Type 94 high-angle fire-control {{directors}} were fitted {{to control the}} Type 89 guns.

They could control all of the forward and rear guns respectively as necessary. Type 22 and Type 13 air search radars may have been fitted.|$|E

5|$|Minas Geraes and São Paulo were {{originally}} armed with twelve 12-inch/45 caliber, twenty-two 4.7-inch/50 caliber, eighteen 3-pounders and eight 1-pounder naval guns.

5|$|Pre-dreadnoughts carried guns {{of several}} {{different}} calibres, for different roles in ship-to-ship combat. The main armament was four heavy guns, mounted in two centre-line turrets <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> aft. Very few pre-dreadnoughts deviated from this arrangement. These guns were slow-firing, and initially of limited accuracy; {{but they were}} the only guns heavy enough to penetrate the thick armour which protected the engines, magazines, and main guns of enemy battleships.|$|E

In 1862 her armament was revised and two 60-pounder and the two long 36-pounder guns on her upper deck were removed.

Baden {{and her sister}} Bayern were the first German warships to feature guns of this caliber; earlier battleships carried either 28 or 30.5cm (11 or 12inch) guns. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 15cm (5.9in) guns, six 8.8cm (3.45in) guns and five 60cm (23.6in) underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam.

For defence against torpedo boats, Lord Nelson carried twenty-four QF 12-pounder 18 cwt guns and two 3-pounder guns. She also mounted five submerged 18-inch (457mm) torpedo tubes for which 23 torpedoes were stowed aboard.|$|E

Two of these guns were each installed on the roofs of the <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> aft centreline turrets and the wing turrets in unshielded mounts, and the other ten were positioned in the superstructure.
