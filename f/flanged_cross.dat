40|$|Environmental degradation, {{increased}} service loads, {{reduced capacity}} due to aging, degradation owing to poor construction materials and workmanships and conditional need for seismic retrofitting have demanded {{the necessity for}} repair and rehabilitation of existing structures. Fibre reinforced polymers has been used successfully in many such applications for reasons like low weight, high strength and durability. Many previous research works on torsional strengthening were focused on solid rectangular RC beams with different strip layouts and different types of fibres. Various analytical models were developed to predict torsional behavior of strengthened rectangular beams and successfully used for validation of the experimental works. But literature on torsional strengthening of RC T- beam is limited. In the present work experimental {{study was conducted in}} order to have a better understanding the behavior of torsional strengthening of solid RC flanged T-beams. An RC T-beam is analyzed and designed for torsion like an RC rectangular beam; the effect of concrete on flange is neglected by codes. In the present study effect of flange part in resisting torsion is studied by changing flange width of controlled beams. The other parameters studied are strengthening configurations and fiber orientations. The objective of present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of epoxy-bonded GFRP fabrics as external transverse reinforced to reinforced concrete beams with <b>flanged</b> <b>cross</b> sections (T-beam) subjected to torsion. Torsional results from strengthened beams are compared with the experimental result of the control beams without FRP application. The study shows remarkable improvement in torsional behavior of all the GFRP strengthen beams. The experimentally obtained results are validated with analytical model presented by A. Deifalla and A. Ghobarah and found in good agreement...|$|E
40|$|The {{monolithic}} structural {{action of}} various types of walls of <b>flanged</b> <b>cross</b> section and walls with engaged stiffeners or returns (nonrectangular sections) is critically dependent on the shear capacity of the interface between the components making up the section. An assessment of the shear capacity of the interface may also be required {{as part of the}} elastic or inelastic analysis of structural elements. Observation of past earthquake events has confirmed that effectively connected flanges also directly influence the seismic performance of nonrectangular sections by providing a more robust and seismically resistant structural element. To analyze the significance of the parameters that influence the vertical shear resistance of interfaces of flanged sections of masonry obtained using different types of bonding and bonding patterns (header units, shear connectors, and wire ties), a series of specimens with “H-shaped” cross sections was tested. The vertical shear capacity of the interface at the flange-web intersection was assessed in each case and compared to predicted code capacities. Considerable strength reserves and shear ductility were observed in almost all cases. Following the experimental study, a numerical investigation was carried out using a simplified micromodeling finite element approach. It showed that both the size of the specimen as well as the boundary and applied loading conditions on the flanges can significantly influence the observed vertical shear resistance of the interfaces of specimens with the same bonding pattern. Using the results of the numerical investigation, the critical parameters for a test to determine the vertical shear capacity of brick masonry nonrectangular cross sections are assessed and the governing parameters for a suitable shear test suggested...|$|E
40|$|The {{cryogenic}} module of Mass Driver Two comprises a 3. 25 inch (82. 55 mm) OD bucket {{with two}} 44 kilo-ampere-turn coils made with. 028 inch (. 71 mm) diam niobium-titanium multi-filamentary cable in a copper matrix, impregnated with lead alloy for thermal inertia, {{as well as}} the service station to refrigerate, energize and eject the bucket. The station is housed in a six inch <b>flanged</b> pyrex <b>cross</b> which connects to the four inch pyrex tube of the mass driver itself. The bucket is refrigerated by being forced against a copper braid cradle attached to the bottom of a liquid helium reservoir which protrudes into the cross from above. The bucket is energized inductively by turning off two superconducting coils which are also attached to the helium reservoir, and which have maintained the correct flux linkage through the bucket coils during their cool-down through the critical temperature. Once charging is completed, the clamping pressure is released and the bucket is injected into the mass driver by means of two normal-conductor pulse coils surrounding the horizontal branches of the cross...|$|R
50|$|Blackbutt has dark fibrous grey-brown spongy bark {{covering}} {{the lower part}} of the trunk, which comes away in strips. The bark higher up and on the branches is a glossy cream, occasionally with scribbles from insect larvae. The branchlets are square in cross section. Juvenile specimens are conspicuous, with pairs of opposite, broad-lanceolate leaves, much paler below the leaf than above which may reach 17 cm long by 4 cm wide. Blackbutt is a Eucalyptus species without a lignotuber. The adult leaves are arranged alternately on the stem, lanceolate to slightly sickle shaped, 9 to 16 cm long, and 1.5 to 3 cm wide. Asymmetrical at the base, they are oblique in shape. The leaves are same shade of glossy to dark green above and below the leaf. The leaf stems are four sided or squarish with a <b>flanged</b> edge in <b>cross</b> section.|$|R
