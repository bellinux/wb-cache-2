25|$|The United States needed $3.1 {{billion to}} pay for the immense armies and fleets raised to fight the Civil War — over $400million just in 1862. The largest tax sum by far came from new excise taxes—a sort of value added tax—that was imposed on <b>every</b> <b>sort</b> of {{manufactured}} item. Second came much higher tariffs, through several Morrill tariff laws. Third came the nation's first income tax; only the wealthy paid and it was repealed at war's end.|$|E

25|$|The {{population}} of the Sich had a cosmopolitan component, including Ukrainians, Moldavians, Tatars, Poles, Lithuanians, Jews, Russians and many other ethnicities. The social structure was complex, consisting of destitute gentry and boyars, szlachta (Polish nobility), merchants, peasants, outlaws of <b>every</b> <b>sort,</b> runaway slaves from Turkish galleys, and runaway serfs (as the Zaporozhian polkovnyk Pivtorakozhukha). Some {{of those who were}} not accepted to the host formed gangs of their own, and also claimed to be Cossacks. However, after the Khmelnytsky Uprising these formations largely disappeared and were integrated mainly into Hetmanate society.|$|E
25|$|As {{the funds}} were running low General Márquez engrossed $150,000 from the Barron, Forbes & Co. and impounded $60,000 {{more on the}} Nacional Monte de Piedad. No {{supplies}} could reach the city after it had been surrounded {{and as a result}} food stores ran empty and the forced levies just worsened the situation. Only three bakeries were still open to furnish the soldiers and the remaining two hundred thousand inhabitants. House raids were everyday common for hidden foodstocks. Still hundreds of people died of the famine. <b>Every</b> <b>sort</b> of commerce was completely suspended.|$|E

Counterdrug (CD) is a high priority national security and international cooperation mission, with DOD functions and responsibilities based on statutory authority. The Armed Forces of the United States assist partner nations (PNs) in their CD efforts. Illicit drug trafficking, smuggling of <b>every</b> <b>sort,</b> and the regional and global movement of terrorists are closely linked by financial, political, and operational linkages.|$|E

Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and to have something to do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.|$|E

2500|$|Reading in [...] that [...] "every living {{substance}} {{was destroyed}} that was upon {{the face of}} the ground" [...] — people and animals alike — the Gemara asked how the beasts had sinned (to deserve this punishment).

But then his son died. So the father broke up the canopy, saying that he had prepared it only for his son. Now that the son was dead, the father had no need for a banquet. Thus God created the animals only for the benefit of people. Now that people had sinned, God had no need for the animals.|$|E

30|$|Even though {{fractional}} calculus is {{a highly}} useful and important topic, a general solution method {{which could be used}} at almost <b>every</b> <b>sorts</b> of problems has not yet been established. Most of the solution techniques in this area have been developed for particular sorts of problems. As a result, a single standard method for problems regarding fractional calculus has not emerged. Therefore, finding reliable and accurate solution techniques along with fast implementation methods is useful and active research area. Some well-known methods for the analytical and numerical solutions of fractional differential and integral equations might be listed as power series method [3], differential transform method [4] and [5], homotopy analysis method [6], variational iteration method [7] and homotopy perturbation method [8]. Typical numerical methods including collocation, finite differences and elements are among the most popular numerical techniques, and detailed information about most of these techniques can be obtained from, for instance, [9 – 11] and the aforementioned references.|$|R
