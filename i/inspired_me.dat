5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

The technology and concept were so genius. She was inspired after discovering Cuccarini's performance online. Thank God for YouTube or I would have never been exposed to something so inspiring. I never worked so hard on anything in my life as that performance for the Billboard Awards." ...|$|E

500|$|Inspired by the {{aspirations}} of Knowles's father Mathew, the album was titled after Hadley Street, a plot of land in downtown Houston: [...] "My father took me there one day {{and told me he}} was going to build a studio," [...] {{she said in an interview}} with the Daily Mail.

[...] Jacknife Lee {{produced}} the track with the band in early 2008 in what was the third and final recording session for the album. The many references to popular culture in the song are said to be a [...] "statement of defiance" [...] according to Internet reviewer David Ritter, who later describes it to be an [...] "anti-anthem anthem" [...] that opens up a [...] "broad space for critical exploration {{of what it means to}} be an [...] aging band in the major label system".|$|E
500|$|In 2005 Black {{released}} Drinkin' Songs and Other Logic. [...] Black {{chose the}} title of the album to limit himself to simple topics in his past. He explained: [...] "I went out and bought all the music I grew up on that I didn't already have and spent three months listening to only that. Only stuff from before I started making records, so it was pre-1989—Waylon, Willie, Buck Owens, Haggard, Don Williams, Jim Croce. And what I discovered was a simplicity in song that I had moved away from. It was quite an emotional journey because these were all the songs that moved me and <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> to do what I've been doing ever since." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Lupo the Butcher was a {{successful}} short and has earned itself a cult following. Eric Fogel, co-creator of Glenn Martin, DDS, stated that Lupo the Butcher inspired him {{to pursue a career}} in animation, saying: [...] "That film opened my eyes to a world of animation that was strictly for grownups and <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> to pursue a career path that was a bit more…twisted." [...] In an interview with Take One, Linda Simensky called the short [...] "the South Park of its time" [...] and stated that she remembers tapes containing the short being passed around her office in 1988.

In 2001, American politician Mark Earley called it his favorite book. That year, English musician Noel Gallagher asked Irish musician Bono to explain religion {{to him because}} Gallagher knew Bono believed in and prayed to God. Bono spoke with Gallagher on the subject for two hours and sent him a copy of What's So Amazing About Grace? Gallagher later {{said that he was}} [...] "going to have a good read of this book", that Bono [...] "made a lot of sense", and that the gift was particularly meaningful because Bono's father had recently died.|$|E
500|$|... "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] {{became a}} Radio Disney hit, {{remaining}} at number one for 12 weeks. The song's success ultimately benefited Milian's {{career as a}} performer; she explained, [...] "I never realized that show would give me so much exposure. It's great because people have grown with me, even with that damn song. Didn’t know {{so many people were}} watching Kim Possible like that. Because of that song, it actually <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> to do my own musical animated artist {{because a lot of people}} thought I was Kim Possible." [...] Milian has yet to perform the song live in concert but has expressed interest in recording a remix for fans. [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] was the first song Lerios and Gabriel wrote together, and the songwriting duo has since gone on to collaborate on both scoring and writing songs for several other major television networks and programs.|$|E

500|$|Byard {{was born}} in Worcester, Massachusetts. At that time, his parents – John Sr and Geraldine Garr – were living at 47 Clayton Street. Both of his parents played musical instruments; his mother played the piano, as did his uncles and grandmother, the last playing in cinemas during the silent film era. He began piano lessons {{at the age of}} six, but they ended when his family was {{affected}} by the Great Depression. He was also given a trumpet that belonged to his father, and attempted to copy the popular players of the time, Roy Eldridge and Walter Fuller. As a boy he often walked to Lake Quinsigamond to listen to bands performing there. He heard Benny Goodman, Lucky Millinder, Fats Waller, and Chick Webb, and listened to other bands of the era on the radio. [...] "Those were the things that <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> – I guess it stuck with me", he commented decades later.|$|E

You have to keep things interesting for yourself when writing new material so I just took this and ran with it. [...] Those types of lyrics are fun to write, you know? The dark subject matter, the dark master stuff. It's another way of writing, a fresh one to me." [...] He also summarizes the lyrics: [...] "It's a story about somebody who loses himself and end struggles with the darkness, symbolized by the Dark Master. And the story ends up really being the darkness within and goes through the different phases where he has to fight demons and things like that.|$|E

Saran has said [...] "When I studied in DPS Mathura Road in Delhi, there was a school for blind exactly opposite to our school. I used to go there every week and spend time seeing how these students played cricket and did other things normally. That is what <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> {{to do something for}} these people". In an interview to TOI, the actress said: [...] "We feel sympathetic towards them, but we never employ them. We are scared because we have not grown up with them. While these people might be visually impaired, their other senses are very strong. So they can effectively give foot and back massages and treatments like reflexology. It's important to understand that you are not doing a favour on them but they are doing a favour on you".|$|E

[...] Scoring took place at the Sony Scoring Stage with a 107-piece orchestra and 40-person choir. An erhu, performed by Karen Han, was used for the Vulcan themes.

500|$|Herren {{described}} the album {{as an attempt}} to bridge hip hop instrumentals with vocal-orientated hip hop tracks, saying that the chopped and edited raps were [...] "another layer of music" [...] and that he was [...] "into creating a whole new mangled language [...] it's a form of communication without communicating, a new flow when you feel like you're listening to a standard hip hop track but there's something in it that's not right." [...] The cut-up vocals were also described by Herren as a tribute to Miami bass music and the group Mantronix. Herren said: [...] "Old school dirty south and booty shake shit, just the way stuff was edited back then, all the bass music and edit records... that's what <b>inspired</b> <b>me.</b> I wanted to make edit records, but bring all the shit that happened afterwards into it, hip hop from the early 90s through the present day." [...] The song [...] "Nuno" [...] features chopped-up vocals with only the phrase [...] "fuck words of wisdom" [...] intelligible; the title is a reference to the Portuguese musician Nuno Canavarro, whose 1988 album Plux Quba also features manipulated vocals including randomly-reassembled tapes of children singing.
