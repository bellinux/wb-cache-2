40|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of massive water ingress accidents in high temperature reactors supposes a numerical simulation {{of the whole}} facility behaviour. For the AVR-reactor such a model was developed to describe both, the graphite cörrosion processes and the accident transients for different releasing events as well as resulting <b>accident</b> <b>profiles.</b> The variable consideration of regulating facilities of the safety circuit being influenced in reality, enables an optimization of the <b>accident</b> <b>profiles</b> {{in the way of}} a least possible facility damage. It results that in spite of extremely conservative input data with authorization legal relevance even the possible water ingress accidents can safely be controlled after 15 years of operation with steadily increasing safety requirements. First investigations on a selected facility concept for the AVR-reequipment show, that with the definition up to now of the AVR-steam generator failure the <b>accident</b> <b>profiles</b> "reactor under pressure" are conservatively coped with. An increasing degree of detail of the concept proposals, however, requires an examination of this statement...|$|R

30|$|The {{magnitude}} of the obtained effect {{was very close to}} the results obtained earlier. Given the differences in research methods, as well as in local road <b>accident</b> <b>profiles,</b> road networks and rescue procedures, {{it is not possible to}} analyse the differences in greater detail. However, the results of this study are assumed to be reliable because of the detailed analysis of all fatal road accidents that occurred in Finland over a period of 3  years and the fact that only a minimal proportion of cases had insufficient data. The results can be expected to be valid for similar countries as Finland (sparsely populated with long distances, high level of rescue service, low average annual daily traffic on motorways/main roads/secondary roads, and medium level of traffic management). For densely populated countries the effects are expected to be somewhat smaller.|$|R

30|$|The study {{aimed to}} provide an {{estimate}} based on local circumstances, such as <b>accident</b> <b>profile,</b> rescue operation procedures etc. Specifically, {{it is assumed that}} the profile of fatal road accidents in Finland might emphasise the benefits of the eCall system, because 71 % of the accidents that included one or more motor vehicles in the period 2001 – 2003 occurred in rural areas, while the proportion of single-vehicle accidents was 41 % [12]. An even more important motivation for the evaluation was the possibility of utilising in-depth accident reports collected by road accident investigation teams. While earlier studies were based on various statistical models and accident databases, {{this study was designed to}} conduct an in-depth evaluation of each fatal road accident that recently occurred in Finland. In addition to the evaluation of potential safety effects, we assessed the effects of the system on emergency response times and the effects of real-time information about the accident location.|$|R
