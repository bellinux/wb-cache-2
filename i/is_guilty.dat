5|$|The role {{of intent}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and definitive elements of the karma theory, in all its traditions. In Jainism, intent is important but not an essential precondition of sin or wrong conduct. Evil intent forms only one of the modes of committing sin. Any action committed, knowingly or unknowingly, has karmic repercussions. In certain philosophies, like Buddhism, a person <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> of violence only if he had an intention to commit violence. On the other hand, according to Jains, if an act produces violence, then the person <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> of it, whether or not he had an intention to commit it.|$|E
5|$|Such was the {{controversy}} surrounding this storyline that the University of Glamorgan uses the plot {{as part of their}} new approach to the study of British criminal law. Part of the law foundation course involves studying the soap opera and giving students the chance to decide if Dot Cotton's character <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> of murder. The storyline is also featured in GCSE Religious Studies textbooks.|$|E

5|$|Season {{one begins}} with Alex Parrish, a former FBI recruit, {{becoming}} a prime suspect following {{a terrorist attack}} on Grand Central Terminal. She is taken into custody and charged with treason. Her first escape is orchestrated by Deputy Director Miranda Shaw, her primary instructor at Quantico, who refuses {{to believe that she}} <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> and feels someone from her class has framed her. Various flashbacks show Parrish and fellow agents, each having their secret reasons for joining the FBI, training at the FBI Academy. The present timeline focuses on the restrained relationship between Parrish and her boyfriend Ryan Booth and fellow trainees and friends, including: Shelby Wyatt, Nimah and Raina Amin, Simon Asher, Brandon Fletcher, Elias Harper and Caleb Haas, who all somehow seem connected to the bombing, while she is on the run to prove her innocence.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreground}} {{figure of}} the older man may be a reference to Ugolino from Dante's Inferno—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> of cannibalism, {{which was one of}} the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli. An early study for The Raft of the Medusa in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the arm of a headless corpse.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population <b>is</b> <b>guilty,</b> directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

Surely it would have been no diminution of the sternness of new republican virtue, no disgrace to the magnanimity of a great nation, if it had pardoned the perfidy which its own oppression had occasioned, if it had remitted the punishment of the perjury of the king to the tribunal of Him by whom kings reign and princes decree justice.|$|R
5|$|A third subplot centres on the {{relationship}} between Fenwick, Mr. Puddleham, the village's Methodist minister, and the Marquis of Trowbridge, Bullhampton's principal landowner. The marquis believes that Sam Brattle <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> of the murder, and is angered by Fenwick's support for him. He spreads rumours about Fenwick's relations with Carry Brattle, and grants Puddleham permission to build a chapel on a piece of land neighbouring Fenwick's residence, where he hopes that the sight of it and the sound of its bell will annoy the vicar. Fenwick tries to reconcile himself to the existence of the chapel, but it subsequently comes to light that the land does not belong to the marquis, and is instead part of the parish's glebe. The embarrassed marquis pays to move the chapel to a new location, and through the intervention of his son, a suave Member of Parliament, he and Fenwick are reconciled.|$|E
5|$|Because of Peter's {{imprisonment}} Alicia, {{a lawyer}} herself, is {{working as a}} junior associate at a law firm. Alicia serves as second chair for senior partner Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) in a murder trial. Their client, Brad Broussard (Tom Degnan), is charged with shooting Miles Wagner. Wagner was an unpopular mutual fund manager who defrauded Broussard and many other out of their life savings by assisting in Bernard Madoff's investment scandal. Broussard was found covered in blood next to Wagner's body, but insists on his innocence. Diane consults ballistics expert Kurt McVeigh (Gary Cole), a mustachioed country man with a strict principle {{that he will not}} work if the client <b>is</b> <b>guilty.</b> Kurt testifies that Wagner was shot inside a car despite being found on the floor. Wagner's partner, Martin Knox (Kevin O'Rourke), had a strong financial motive to kill Wagner. Knox's wife, Rachel (Geraldine Hughes), strongly dislikes her husband and is willing to implicate him, but is bound by spousal privilege laws. Alicia discovers a conspiracy tactic that will allow Rachel to testify, and Broussard is vindicated and set free. The firm's investigator Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi) visits FBI agent Lana Delaney (Jill Flint) inquiring about the investigation into Peter. Delaney asks Kalinda to feed her information about Peter, but Kalinda declines.|$|E
5|$|John Koller {{explains}} {{the role of}} intent in Jainism with {{the example of a}} monk, who unknowingly offered poisoned food to his brethren. According to the Jain view, the monk <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> of a violent act if the other monks die because they eat the poisoned food; but according to the Buddhist view he would not be guilty. The crucial difference between the two views is that the Buddhist view excuses the act, categorising it as non-intentional, since he was not aware that the food was poisoned; whereas the Jain view holds the monk to have been responsible, due to his ignorance and carelessness. Jains argue that the monk's very ignorance and carelessness constitute an intent to do violence and hence entail his guilt. So the absence of intent does not absolve a person from the karmic consequences of guilt either, according to the Jain analysis.|$|E

While she's in Spain, she shockingly finds her daughter Sam (now played by Kim Medcalf) working as a lap dancer and takes her home. Peggy later decides to move to Brazil to be with Grant but visits Walford for Sam's wedding to Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) before returning to Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{receives}} a voice message from his foster sister Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), {{a police officer}} in the vice department and, Dexter believes, the only person who loves him. Debra says she is at a crime scene and wants him to be there, because she needs his help. Dexter arrives and Debra, undercover as a prostitute, informs him that another hooker has been killed, the third in five months. Dexter inspects the victim and is shocked to learn that the chopped up corpse is bloodless. Dexter leaves, awed by the killer's technique, and says that {{due to the lack of}} blood he can't help out. At the police station, Dexter discusses another murder case being handled by James Doakes (Erik King), who hates Dexter and suspects he is hiding something. Dexter suggests that it was a crime of passion, rather than the bad drug deal Doakes believes it to be. Dexter surveils Jamie Jaworski, a murderer who escaped justice due to a faulty warrant, and breaks into his home to find proof of his crime. Once he confirms that Jaworski <b>is</b> <b>guilty,</b> Dexter meets with his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), a domestic violence victim. Because of her violent past with her husband, Rita has no interest in sex, and Dexter secretly feels comfortable with the lack of intimacy. Rita has two young children, Astor and Cody, whom Dexter genuinely feels for. While on a date with Rita, Dexter finds another crime scene in which the victim has been cut into pieces with no traces of blood; this time, however, the head is missing. Dexter theorizes that the killer murders his victims in extreme cold, explaining the absence of blood. Dexter further suggests that a stolen refrigerated truck is being used for the murders. Dexter allows Debra to pitch the theory, but their superior officer, Lt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez), who dislikes Debra, dismisses it.|$|E
5|$|Set in the author's present day, the interwar period, {{the novel}} centers on two strangers who arrive at {{different}} times in Jefferson, Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, a fictional county based on Faulkner's home, Lafayette County, Mississippi. The plot first focuses on Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Alabama looking for {{the father of her}} unborn child, and then shifts to explore the life of Joe Christmas, a man who has settled in Jefferson and passes as white, but who secretly believes he has some black ancestry. After a series of flashbacks narrating Christmas's early life, the plot resumes with his living and working with Lucas Burch, the father of Lena's child, who fled to Jefferson and changed his name when he found out that Lena was pregnant. The woman on whose property Christmas and Burch have been living, Joanna Burden, a descendant of Yankee abolitionists hated by the citizens of Jefferson, is murdered. Burch is caught {{at the scene of the}} crime and reveals that Christmas had been romantically involved with her and is part black, thus implying that he <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> of her murder. While Burch sits in jail awaiting his reward for turning in Christmas, Lena is assisted by Byron Bunch, a shy, mild-mannered bachelor who falls in love with her. Bunch seeks the aid of another outcast in the town, the disgraced former minister Gail Hightower, to help Lena give birth and protect Christmas from being lynched. Though Hightower refuses the latter, Christmas escapes to his house and is shot and castrated by a state guardsman. Burch leaves town without his reward, and the novel ends with an anonymous man recounting a story to his wife about some hitchhikers he picked up on the road to Tennesseea woman with a child and a man who was not the father of the child, both looking for the woman's husband.|$|E
