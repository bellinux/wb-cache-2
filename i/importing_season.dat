40|$|A simple {{dynamic model}} {{relating}} forest {{area in a}} region, its contribution to dry season precipita-tion and the effect on its own establishment was developed. The model equation shows hysteresis between forest and savannas {{as a function of}} <b>imported</b> dry <b>season</b> precipitation. Regions are either dominated by forests or savannas, with each ecosystem showing stability despite changes in <b>imported</b> dry <b>season</b> precipitation. Deforestation beyond a certain threshold value, however, could cause a collapse of forest ecosystems and replace-ment by savannas in marginal areas. The predic-tions of this model corroborate pollen core analysis in the Amazon basin, where historical stability of tropical forest cover has been shown despite global climate change. Key word...|$|R

David {{was permitted to}} choose between the three severest dispensations of God's displeasure, and he made choice of pestilence as the least dreadful. Ought a reflecting and religious man to be surprised, if some such punishment were dispensed to this country, not less in mercy than in judgment, as the means of averting a more terrible and abiding scourge? An endemic malady, as destructive as the plague, has naturalised itself among your American brethren, and in Spain.

He would feature in every one of Manchester's games, helping out the offense with an impressive 43 points in 68 games. The Phoenix would make the final of both domestic cups as well as the post-season, but due to off-ice financial problems would choose to play in the EPL for the 2009-10 season.

40|$|The main {{implication}} of the food miles indicator is {{that in order to}} protect the environment consumers should purchase food locally and seasonal. However, something that it is missing in all discussions is the evidence about how bad or good - in terms of locality and seasonality- is the actual consumption of food. This is probably due to the fact that food consumption statistics are available as aggregated annual data. In this paper we analyse the purchases of food, in particular the purchases of soft fruits in Scotland, which not only have marked production seasonality but also are imported from the rest of the UK and from abroad. For the analysis we use the Kantar Worldpanel dataset for the period 2006 until 2009. The results indicate that Scottish soft fruit covers a relatively small segment of the market and therefore eat locally would imply reduce significantly the consumption of soft fruit, even during the Scottish produce season. As regards the consumption seasonality, the purchases of soft fruit, particularly strawberry, seem to be seasonal despite the possibility of getting out-of- <b>season</b> <b>imported</b> soft fruit.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{exploratory}} analysis {{and discussion of}} the supply of New Zealand Calla to the Umeda wholesale auction market in Osaka, Japan. The hypothesis, that total revenue has not been maximised at the Umeda market, was tested and found to be true. The test was conducted by optimising the supply schedule, constrained by the total volume of imported Calla (white and coloured) sold at Umeda each season. To conduct this test, data collection at the Umeda wholesale auction market was necessary. The results are based on observations of {{two and a half}} seasons (January 1992 to June 1994) for each Calla product (i. e. Japanese white Calla, Japanese coloured Calla, imported white Calla and imported coloured Calla). As New Zealand supplies 90 - 95 per cent of Calla imports each year, it was assumed that all imported Calla sold at Umeda were grown in New Zealand. 1 The statement that 90 - 95 per cent of imported Calla are from New Zealand holds for 1989 - 1994. In conjunction with data collection, many representatives of the Japanese cut-flower market were interviewed in order to provide descriptive information as well as the requirements and expectations of the Japanese market (not just the Umeda wholesale auction market). The results show that, in terms of maximising total revenue, imported Calla tend to be poorly allocated over the season. The exception to this was imported white Calla in the 1993 / 4 season, where maximum total revenue was only NZ$ 4, 600 more than the actual. In the previous <b>season,</b> <b>imported</b> white Calla attained a total revenue of NZ$ 17, 700 less than the maximum. The imported coloured Calla results show that maximum total revenue was NZ$ 20, 000 more than the actual in 1992 / 3 and NZ$ 17, 800 more in 1993 / 4. As this paper is of an exploratory nature, total revenue maximisation was not the only focus. Constant Market Shares Analysis was also applied to the data, in an attempt to explain changes in the share of imported Calla at Umeda. The results of Constant Market Shares Analysis were inconclusive with respect to explaining the observed changes. This tested the limits of this deterministic form of analysis. Specifically where the appropriateness of Constant Market Shares Analysis on small data sets and products where the underlying product composition (cultivar and grade mix) changes from season to season. In both respects Constant Market Shares Analysis was found to be very limited as a simple means of explaining changes in supply...|$|R
