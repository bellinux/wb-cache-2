5|$|It is {{also found}} in brackish-water {{habitats}} and is sometimes seen swimming in salt water. It has been much more successful at colonizing Atlantic and Gulf coast barrier islands than the copperhead. However, even on these islands, it tends to favor freshwater marshes. A study by Dunson and Freda (1985) <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> not being particularly salt-tolerant.|$|E
5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati oil shale. One theory suggests that the organic material in the Irati oil shale originated from algae deposited in a lacustrine environment with salinity varying from that of freshwater to brackish water. Other theory suggests that the organic sediment may have been deposited in a shallow, partially restricted marine environment. Hutton's classification <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a marine source oil shale.|$|E
5|$|The biblical view of {{the late}} Iron Age {{political}} and cultural map <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a set of branching genealogies. Biblical figures three generations forward from Terah are invariably described as the eponymous founders of different tribes and polities that interacted with the Kingdom of Judah between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. Such {{is the case of}} the Qedarite Arabs, who according to biblical tradition, are the offspring of the Abraham-Ishmael-Kedar genealogical line.|$|E
50|$|The crested {{chameleon}} {{was first}} described by Stutchbury in 1837. In 1865, Gray <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the Pterosaurus cristatus. Werner <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the Chamaeleon cristatus in 1911, and Mertens <b>described</b> <b>it</b> in 1966 <b>as</b> Chamaeleo cristatus. Klaver and Böhme <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> Chamaeleo (Trioceros) cristatus in 1986, and Necas <b>described</b> <b>it</b> {{under the same}} name in 1999.

5|$|A Sea Symphony (1910), {{the only}} one of the series to include a part for full choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements. The extent to which it is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a hybrid work, with {{elements}} of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.|$|E

5|$|This is {{the most}} aquatic species of the genus Agkistrodon, and is usually {{associated}} with bodies of water, such as creeks, streams, marshes, swamps, and the shores of ponds and lakes. The U.S. Navy (1991) <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> inhabiting swamps, shallow lakes, and sluggish streams, but it is usually not found in swift, deep, cool water. Behler and King (1979) list its habitats as including lowland swamps, lakes, rivers, bayheads, sloughs, irrigation ditches, canals, rice fields, and small, clear, rocky, mountain streams.|$|E

5|$|Alongside {{the second}} series of Life Begins, Bullen {{continued}} developing George the Third. The title {{was changed to}} It Happens until eventually settling on All About George in time for filming in 2005. All About George starred Rik Mayall as George Kinsey, a builder whose life is changed when six generations of his family move into his home. Initially excited about the series when he attended the cast read-throughs, Bullen's optimism waned {{by the time it}} was broadcast as he felt there were too many characters and the series' premise unclear. In a 2008 interview, he <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> one of his worst TV series. Life Begins returned for a third and final series in 2006. The same year, filming commenced on Tripping Over, a series about intercontinental backpackers in 1976 and 2006. SeaChange writers Andrew Knight and Andrea Denholm conceived the idea in 2003 and asked Bullen, a friend of Knight's, to develop it with them. A co-production between Australia's Channel Ten and Britain's Five, Tripping Over was broadcast in both countries at the end of 2006.|$|E
5|$|John Wilson (1847) {{writes that}} the tomb lies {{about two or three}} hundred yards to the north of Jacob's Well, across the valley. He <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> 'a small solid {{erection}} {{in the form of a}} wagon roof, over what is supposed to be the patriarch’s grave, with a small pillar or altar at each of its extremities, sometimes called the tombs of Ephraim and Manasseh, and the middle of an enclosure without a covering. Many visitors names, in the Hebrew and Samaritan characters, are written on the walls of this enclosure.' One of the inscriptions is said to intimate the tomb's repair by a Jew from Egypt, Elijah son of Meir, around 1749. Wilson adds that 'The Jews of Nablus take upon themselves the duty of keeping the tomb in order. They applied to us for a subscription to aid in making some repairs and we complied with their request'. These Hebrew and Samaritan inscriptions were still visible on the white plastered walls as late as 1980, as were small lamps in an internal recess, probably donated by Jews during the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E
5|$|The bicycle kick retains popular appeal; Hesse and Simpson {{highlight}} the positive impact a successful bicycle kick has on player notability, and the United States Soccer Federation <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an iconic embellishment of the sport. Defender Marcelo Balboa's bicycle {{kick in the}} 1994 FIFA World Cup match between Colombia and the United States received much praise and is even credited with boosting the sport's popularity in the United States. According to former Manchester City defender Paul Lake, a notable bicycle kick performed by English left winger Dennis Tueart in the English Premier League injured hundreds of fans who tried to emulate it. When Italian striker Mario Balotelli, during his youth development years, tried to pattern his skills on those of Brazilian midfielder Ronaldinho and French midfielder Zinedine Zidane, he fixated on the bicycle kick. The manoeuvre is also admired in variants of association football, such as beach soccer and futsal. An action like the bicycle kick is also used in sepak takraw, a sport {{whose objective is to}} kick a ball over a net and into the opposing team's side.|$|E

5|$|Water clocks, or clepsydrae, were {{commonly}} used in Ancient Greece following their introduction by Plato, who also invented a water-based alarm clock. One account of Plato's alarm clock <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> depending on the nightly overflow of a vessel containing lead balls, which floated in a columnar vat. The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the Academy. Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a siphon. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm. The Greeks and Chaldeans regularly maintained timekeeping records as {{an essential part of}} their astronomical observations.|$|E
5|$|In late 1077 {{or early}} 1078 trouble began between William and his eldest son, Robert. Although Orderic Vitalis <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{starting}} with a quarrel between Robert and his two younger brothers, William and Henry, including a story that the quarrel was started when William and Henry threw water at Robert, {{it is much more}} likely that Robert was feeling powerless. Orderic relates that he had previously demanded control of Maine and Normandy and had been rebuffed. The trouble in 1077 or 1078 resulted in Robert leaving Normandy accompanied by a band of young men, many of them the sons of William's supporters. Included among them was Robert of Belleme, William de Breteuil, and Roger, the son of Richard fitzGilbert. This band of young men went to the castle at Remalard, where they proceeded to raid into Normandy. The raiders were supported by many of William's continental enemies. William immediately attacked the rebels and drove them from Remalard, but King Philip gave them the castle at Gerberoi, where they were joined by new supporters. William then laid siege to Gerberoi in January 1079. After three weeks, the besieged forces sallied from the castle and managed to take the besiegers by surprise. William was unhorsed by Robert and was only saved from death by an Englishman. William's forces were forced to lift the siege, and the king returned to Rouen. By 12 April 1080, William and Robert had reached an accommodation, with William once more affirming that Robert would receive Normandy when he died.|$|E
