40|$|The European Commission's {{proposed}} {{regulations for}} further {{reform of the}} cereals, rice, <b>dried</b> <b>fodder,</b> and dairy sectors have been published. The regulations cover: direct aid schemes; support for rural development; the common organisation {{of the market in}} cereals; the common organisation of the market in rice; the common organisation of the market in dried fodder; the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products; the levy on milk and milk products. In addition to reiterating the general concept behind the process of CAP reform, the explanatory memorandum sets out the impact of the proposed reforms. The Commission claims that the 'adjustments proposed will complement the EU's international objective of ensuring that developing countries fully benefit from the expansion of world trade, while maintaining food security'. This will be achieved through reducing export availability, 'thereby contributing to stronger world market prices, which {{is in the interest of}} the agricultural sector in developing countries'. The reform process will also 'provide a sustainable and predictable policy framework for the European Model of Agriculture'. The Commission also emphasises that the reform process will require additional budgetary expenditures since farmers' incomes will need to be maintained. With regard to individual products the cereals-sector proposal would result in: a 5 % reduction in the cereals intervention price to € 95. 30 /tonnee from 2004 / 05; the abolition of seasonal corrections; and the end of intervention for rye. Area payments will be increased from € 63 to € 66 /tonne with these payments being included in the single farm payment. For protein crops the current support payment will be maintained and converted into a crop specific area payment of € 55. 57 /ha. For rice a one-step reduction in the intervention price by 50 % to an effective support price of € 150 /tonne, in line with world prices, is proposed, with direct aid being increased from € 52 /tonnee to € 177 /tonne. € 102 of this will be part of the single-farm payment, paid on the basis of historical rights, while € 75 /tonne multiplied by a specified yield will be paid as crop-specific aid. A private storage scheme will be introduced, to be triggered when the market price falls below the effective support price. In addition special measures will be triggered when market prices fall below € 120 /tonne. Proposals are also put forward for durum wheat, dairy products, starch, potatoes, <b>dried</b> <b>fodder,</b> seeds and nuts. Against this background a single farm payment will replace most of the premia under different common organisations of the market. This will cover arable crops, beef and veal, milk and dairy, sheep and goats, starch potatoes, grain legumes, rice, seeds, <b>dried</b> <b>fodder.</b> As the Commission explains it 'this single farm payment will be broken down into payment entitlements in order to facilitate their transfer. Each entitlement will be calculated by dividing the reference amount by the number of hectares, which gave rise to this amount in the reference years'. The new payment system will be linked to cross compliance with EU standards in the fields of environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and occupational safety. Accompanying these measures the EU will strengthen the rural-development pillar of the CAP. Comment: The development of the most immediate significance to the ACP concerns the rice sector, where the reduction in the EU price is likely to lead to dramatic income losses for Guyana and Surinam. According to the FAPRI study (see last edition) rice-sector reform will also lead to a 20 % expansion in EU rice production, despite an estimated 41 % decline in the EU market price of rice. With such an increase in production, EU exports are likely to rise substantially. These predicted developments sit uneasily with the European Commission's assertion that reform will reduce export availability. The sustainability of the European Model of Agriculture will be achieved by reducing the attractiveness of the EU market to below that of the world market, thereby doing away with the need for both tariff protection and export refunds. It should be noted that when the European Commission asserts a reduction in production as a result of reform, this is in comparison with production levels which would have been attained without the introduction of reform and is not with reference to current production levels. With reference to current production levels, The FAPRI study suggests that post reform production levels will be higher in all major products except barley and beef. It should be borne in mind that with the budgetary ceiling fixed, further reform is likely to be more difficult to secure agreement on, since new expenditures will need to be financed from saving elsewhere in the CAP budget. This will require hard negotiations in the EU Council and this could well slow down the pace of reform, particularly if the US$/euro exchange rate makes export refunds more expensive.

In 2011, a questionnaire of 184 items distributed into technical and social characteristics was applied to {{a representative sample of}} 3, 285 farms with 50 or less cows (0. 97 %). The farms were classified into three groups according to their dimension: very small (1 - 9 cows), small (10 - 19 cows) and medium (20 - 50 cows). A general linear model (GLM) with two factors and their interactions was applied. Significant effects in dimension and ecological zone were found as well as seven interactions between both factors (p< 0. 05). Native pastures were used in all farms for grazing.

A cross sectional study was performed to see whether barn drying provides protection against respiratory problems in dairy farmers. METHODS [...] The respiratory symptoms and function {{of a group of}} 123 farmers with daily exposure to cattle foddering from farms which had had a barn drying system {{for at least three years}} were compared with those of a representative sample of 274 farmers working in farms with traditional storage in five districts in the Doubs region of France. RESULTS [...] Both groups were comparable for mean age, weight, height, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, past history of respiratory disease, history of allergy, geographical location of the farm, and length of exposure. Retrospectively estimated exposure to fodder was greater in the group using a barn drying system than in the group working with traditional storage. Acute symptoms at exposure (rhinitis, eye irritation, dry cough, asthma symptoms) and chronic symptoms all tended to be less frequent in the barn drying group, although not individually significantly so. Mean (SD) respiratory function parameters were higher in the barn drying group than in the traditional group: % vital capacity (VC) 104 (14) v 102 (15); % forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 99 (14) v 94 (18); % FEV 1 /VC 96 (11) v 92 (16); % forced mid expiratory flow (FEF 25 - 75) 87 (24) v 79 (25).

40|$|To save poor rusted timothy hay, and let better fodder go {{to waste}} in the corn fields, {{has always been the}} rule in the west. Here are a few facts which are worth considering.

To cut it earlier, would cause it to be less nutritious. On a preceding page of this bulletin we stated, that digestible albuminoids and fats were worth 3. 343 cents per pound, and that carbohydrates were worth 0. 6 cents per pound in Iowa. Therefore, a little figuring will show, that a ton of good corn fodder is worth $ 8. 08 or $ 16. 16 per acre, as average corn fields in Iowa yield two tons of field <b>dried</b> <b>fodder</b> per acre.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} in Alwar District of Rajasthan with the objectives {{to examine the}} input-output relationships and assess the resource use efficiency in milk production. The study covered 75 cooperative member milk producers and 75 non-cooperative member milk producers. The results of Cobb-Douglas production function revealed that concentrate had positive and significant influence on returns from buffalo milk across all the household categories for both the member and non-member groups. Green fodder and <b>dry</b> <b>fodder</b> were also influenced the returns from milk significantly across all the household categories for both the member and non-member groups with the sole exception of large category of non-member group. D 1 (winter) and D 2 (Rainy) dummy variables {{were found to be}} positive and statistically significant. The results of Chow’s test clearly revealed that the production functions between member and non-member groups differed significantly. The results of the resource use efficiency revealed that green fodder was over-utilized in small and medium categories for both the member and non-member groups, <b>dry</b> <b>fodder</b> was over-utilized by medium categor...|$|E
40|$|Most of the Lathyrus {{species of}} the Vojvodina Province arc {{cultivated}} for fodder. They are protein-containing herbs which easily recover after grazing. Some perennial species survive in grassland communities for ten years or more. Certain species are important melliferous plants. In the Vojvodina Province, they inhabit different habitats like forests and grasslands, dry and wet sites, thus showing a wide distribution range. Besides their floristic and vegetation aspects, their role as green and <b>dry</b> <b>fodder</b> crops should be emphasized...|$|E

ICRISAT along with its partners are taking corrective action. Key research activities were to make the farmers aware about the technology of chopping green and <b>dry</b> <b>fodder</b> for optimum and efficient utilization of CR using a machine and its cost benefit of technology and To identify a local fabricator to innovate it as per Malian situation...|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} on nomadic or {{semi-nomadic}} pastoralists whose resources of concern are water, <b>dry</b> season <b>fodder</b> and pastures. This study envisages {{that the success of}} the traditional pastoral resource utilization system depends upon risk spreading and highly flexible mechanisms such as human and livestock mobility, communal land ownership, herd diversity and herd separation or splitting. The current livestock production system was unsustainable thus the basis for this study, which sought to assess the community’s socio-economic characteristics; document the trends in the livestock population; and assess the level of forest use in livestock production by the forest adjacent local community. Seventy-nine respondents (30 %) were studied using a structured questionnaire and data analyzed using Excel (MS office) and Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS). Trade in livestock, livestock products and livestock inputs provide employment and income opportunities for the local communities. The majority of the local people derive 78 % of their total income from livestock sales. The sustainable forest based livestock production system depends upon adoption of controlled grazing practices where incentives, taxation methods, environmental education and awareness programs, appropriate resettlement of forest dwellers and promotion of alternative sources of income such as agri-pastoral business development...|$|R
40|$|Growth and {{production}} potential of 3 -year-old Anogeissus pendula-based silvopastoral system was studied where Chrysopogonfulvus was a grass and Stylosanthes hamata was a legume component. The treatments {{consisted of three}} initiations of pruning (4 th, 5 th, 6 th year after plantation), three pruning intensities (25, 50 and 75 % of height of the tree from trunk base) and two controls (unpruned trees with pasture and pasture without trees). The results of five-year-study revealed {{that there were no}} significant variations in the growth parameters (height, dbh and canopy diameter) due to different treatments. The average MAI for height and dbh of A. pendula ranged from 0. 44 to 0. 51 m and 0. 29 to 0. 42 cm, respectively, which was above average growth due to better planting material. The <b>dry</b> leaf <b>fodder</b> and fuel wood increased as the pruning intensity increased, but the differences were non-significant except during the year 2000 in case of leaf <b>fodder</b> production. The <b>dry</b> forage yield of understorey forage significantly enhanced with increased pruning intensity. Pooled data of three years showed increase in forage yield by 7, 24 and 40 % due to pruning up to 25, 50 and 75 % tree height over unpruned trees. However, on an average pure pasture produced 42 % higher yield over 75 % pruning of trees...|$|R
40|$|Difficulties on weeds {{control and}} <b>fodder</b> {{scarcity}} in <b>dry</b> season {{are the major}} problems at dry land. Aim {{of this research was}} to identify and to explore the potency of several kinds of weeds, forages, and agricultural wastes that can be used as fodder, and further might be processed to make hay and silage. Explorative research to identify, observe, and collect data has been done using descriptive method of dominant weeds, forages, and agricultural waste that frequently used as fodder by farmers. The farmer’s decision to use weeds, forages, and agricultural wastes were determined by preference level of cattles and farmers empirical experiences. Result showed that dominant weeds found were broad leafed weeds with domination level 34. 62 - 81. 45 % and narrow leafed weeds (grasses and teki) with domination level 28. 65 - 65. 38 %. Broad leafed weeds that generally used as fodder were Cintella asiatica, Amaranthus spp., Mikania sp., Cyclosorous aridus, Gleichenia linearis, Physalis angulata, Portulaca oleracea, Mucaena pruriens, and Desmodium scalpe. Grasses weeds and teki were potential fodder with preference level of cattle from very much like to extremely like. Forage and agricultural waste that be potential as fodder were gamal leaf, sengon leaf, banana leaf and stem and coconut, agricultural waste of peanuts, corn, and sweet potato.
