5|$|Vachss had {{previously}} worked with Dark Horse Comics {{to produce a}} ten-issue series (1992–1993) titled Hard Looks. Steve Korte of DC Comics's book division approached Vacchs {{with the possibility of}} a partnership. Vachss was hesitant about using creative property that belonged to someone <b>else</b> <b>but</b> recognized the opportunity to reach a new audience. He started writing the novel, on speculation, and DC Comics eventually agreed to the project, allowing Vachss to take some creative liberties.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{lifetime}} the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744–1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum. Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 'the earth is then nothing <b>else</b> <b>but</b> a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers'. He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{rebellion}} at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney write, a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, {{they had an}} advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone <b>else...</b> <b>But</b> that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night {{the lives of millions}} of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.|$|E

5|$|Elijah Hise, Chief Justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, was {{the leading}} {{candidate}} for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, but after the Whig nomination of Crittenden, Hise withdrew from consideration. The Democratic state convention then nominated Congressman Linn Boyd, but Boyd also declined the nomination. The Democrats were finally able to nominate Henderson lawyer Lazarus W. Powell. As Crittenden canvassed the state, his opponents charged him with disloyalty to Clay because he refused to support him in the 1848 election. Crittenden maintained that he supported Clay for the presidency over anyone <b>else,</b> <b>but</b> he had believed that Clay {{did not intend to}} seek the Whig nomination in 1848. After Clay announced his candidacy, Crittenden said, he remained neutral in the Whigs' choice. In the gubernatorial election, Crittenden defeated Powell by a vote of 65,860 to 57,397. He resigned his Senate seat to assume the governorship.|$|E

K'Vagh contacts Admiral Krell, who {{tells him that}} if a cure is not completed soon, the facility will be eradicated in order to contain the disease. Back on Enterprise, Archer questions Reed about his recent actions, and is contacted by Harris from Section 31, a secretive agency within Starfleet. Harris reveals that Phlox is on an important mission and little <b>else,</b> <b>but</b> Reed reveals his location as Qu'Vat; Harris contacts Krell, to inform him that Enterprise is on the way, and Krell reveals that he used Harris. Enterprise arrives at the colony, and Archer beams down to the base with Marab to confront the Klingons and Phlox.|$|E
5|$|POV (point of view) {{shots were}} done with the Tiger Moth biplane. During one such time {{at the end of}} summer, by which time the grass around Booker Airfield had turned brown, members of the effects team {{rectified}} the colour by applying green paint. Some time later, the production team received a message that a furious farmer's prize ram (an uncastrated sheep) had died, and when the animal was cut open, there was a large amount of green paint inside it. Concluding that no one <b>else</b> <b>but</b> them were responsible for the death, the production team did a lot of explaining and funded the cost of the incident. Production manager Norman Foster gave the farmer's wife a big bunch of flowers.|$|E

Accidentally bumped by them, Stewie tumbles {{down the stairs}} and becomes unconscious, {{suffering}} a severe head wound. Chris and Meg hide the wound with a hat. Continuing the charade, they are approached by Peter, who asks how long Stewie has been unconscious. Peter reveals that he has knocked both of them out plenty of times, and wants to continue hiding Stewie's injury from Lois until he can frame her for it. The next day, noticing Lois pulling out of the driveway, Peter throws Stewie behind her car, making it appear as if Lois has run him over. Lois suggests they frame someone <b>else,</b> <b>but</b> Peter professes his love for her and suggests they take Stewie to the hospital. At the end of the show, Stewie walks in on the family with his head wrapped in bandages, revealing that many months have passed since his accident, he asks what happened to him.|$|E
5|$|The cage {{crinoline}} {{made out}} of spring steel wire was first introduced in the 1850s, with the earliest British patent for a metal crinoline (described as a 'skeleton petticoat of steel springs fastened to tape.') granted in July 1856. Alison Gernsheim suggests that the unidentified French inventor was probably R. C. Milliet of Besançon, as the July 1856 patent was filed by their British agent, C. Amet. Milliet had already patented a 'tournure de femme' in Paris on 24 April 1856 which was described as comprising 'elastic extensible circles joined together by vertical bands.' Following its introduction, the women's rights advocate Amelia Bloomer felt that her concerns about the hampering nature of multiple petticoats had been resolved, and dropped dress reform as an issue. Diana de Marly, in her biography of the couturier Charles Frederick Worth noted that by 1858 there existed steel factories catering solely to crinoline manufacturers, and shops that sold nothing <b>else</b> <b>but</b> crinolines. One {{of the most significant}} manufacturers of crinolines was that of Thomson & Co., founded by an American with branches across Europe and the United States. At the height of their success, up to four thousand crinolines were produced by Thomson's London factory in a day, whilst another plant in Saxony manufactured 9.5 million crinolines over a twelve-year period. In 1859 the New York factory, which employed about a thousand girls, used 300,000yards of steel wire every week to produce between three and four thousand crinolines per day, while the rival Douglas & Sherwood factory in Manhattan used a ton of steel each week in manufacturing hoop skirts.|$|E
