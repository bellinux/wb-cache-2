40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{relationship}} between beliefs and economic policy in the context of gasoline prices following Hurricane Katrina. Design/methodology/approach – The paper applies three contributions – by North, Caplan and Higgs – to the question of gasoline pricing policy; and surveys public opinion regarding interference with prices. Findings – The paper identifies evidence of “anti-market bias” in polling data, press releases, and legislation, and argues that the uncertainty emanating from statutes restricting “price gouging” may reduce investment in the provision of “necessary goods and services” after natural disasters. Originality/value – The paper is of value in offering evidence of anti-market and anti-foreign bias among what might be called political first responders to Hurricane Katrina, and posits the view that interference with prices compounded the shortages facing the Gulf coast or any other <b>disaster-stricken</b> <b>area.</b> Disasters, Economic conditions, Gasoline, Prices, United States of America...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{function}} of the facilitator in extracting and coordinating the needs-seeds of both victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake and their supporters. The subject-matter of the research is a group of strawberry farmers of Watari-town who are victims of the earthquake. The town is situated in the damaged stricken area of that disaster. The author has been conducting participant observation and action research between April, 2011, and May, 2013, to promote the interaction of the needs-seeds with victims and supporters. The main needs of strawberry farmers were recovering the harvest to its former level, obtaining the alternative delivery channel, and letting many people know about the real condition of the stricken area. According to the needs and seeds of farmers, a Consumers’ Co-operative Union Club has become a core supporter. A “Strawberry-stock model” has been suggested in which victims and supporters participate together; this model was put into practical use in October 2012. This case study describes how a researcher became a facilitator of contributing to “the better state” in a <b>disaster-stricken</b> <b>area...</b>|$|E
30|$|The goal of {{disaster}} recovery is for survivors to regain stability in their lives, livelihoods, and housing. A people-centered housing recovery requires that residents are empowered {{to make decisions}} about their housing reconstruction, and that policies create housing options that support the ability of all residents to reconstruct their homes and lives. The 1995 Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake caused the largest amount of damage in Japan since World War II, and the subsequent recovery is a starting point for understanding contemporary post-disaster housing reconstruction policies in Japan. Beyond an overview of housing reconstruction programs, we can understand the impact these policies had on Kobe residents’ housing and community recovery. In many cases, housing policies implemented after the Kobe earthquake fragmented communities and caused further damage and disruption {{in the lives of the}} survivors. A single-track approach failed to support the entire population of the <b>disaster-stricken</b> <b>area.</b> In subsequent years, Japanese disaster reconstruction laws and policies have seen modifications and improvements. Some of these changes can be seen in cases of recovery after more recent disasters, notably after the 2004 Chuetsu Earthquake in Niigata Prefecture. In the context of these past examples, we can consider what is needed for a people-centered recovery in the Tohoku area after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami.|$|E

40|$|First Draft: October 2012. This Version: September 10, 2014 The Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011 {{not only}} caused severe {{damage to the}} northeastern region, but also {{affected}} millions of households beyond the <b>disaster-stricken</b> <b>area.</b> Most notably, the disaster temporarily created large excess demand for many essential goods, resulting in widespread commodity shortages. Did consumers engage in hoarding after the disaster? Did the commodity shortages create any discrepancy between those consumers {{who were able to}} stockpile goods and those who could not? In this paper, by using the Great East Japan Earthquake as a natural experiment and taking advantage of unique high-frequency scanner data, we investigate the short-run effects of a major disaster on commodity prices and household purchasing behaviors. We find that commodity prices increased surprisingly little after the disaster, which implies that the excess demand was resolved, not through prices, but through quantity adjustments. Our empirical analysis shows that, while average household expenditure on storable food rose dramatically in response to the disaster, households that had higher opportunity costs of shopping were less likely to stockpile food. Our results indicate substantial heterogeneity in household purchasing behavior in response to a major disaster, which may have important distributional consequences...|$|E

40|$|The {{shortage}} {{of fresh water}} {{is one of the}} acute challenges that the world is facing now and, thus, energy efficient desalination strategies can provide substantial answers for the water-crisis. Current desalination methods utilizing reverse-osmosis and electrodialysis mechanisms required high power consumptions/large-scale infrastructures which do not make them appropriate for <b>disaster-stricken</b> <b>area</b> or underdeveloped countries. In addition, groundwater contamination by heavy metal compounds, such as arsenic, cadmium and lead, poses significant public health challenges, especially in developing countries. Existing water purification strategies for heavy metal removal are not readily applicable due to technological, environmental, and economical barriers. This presentation elucidates a novel desalination/purification process, where a continuous contaminated stream is divided into filtered and concentrated stream by the ion concentration polarization. The key distinct feature is that both salts and larger particles (cells, viruses, and microorganisms) are pushed away from the membrane, in continuous flow operations, eliminating the membrane fouling that plagues the membrane filtration methods. The power consumption is less than 5 Wh/L, comparable to any existing systems. The energy and removal efficiency, and low cost manufacturability hold strong promises for portable, self-powered water purification/desalination system that can have significant impacts on water shortage in developing/rural part of the world.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAfter the Great East Japan Earthquake, oxygen-dependent {{patients}} in areas experiencing power outages could not continue home oxygen therapy (HOT) without oxygen cylinders. The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine use of oxygen cylinders in areas experiencing power outages and the effects of HOT interruption on patients' health. MethodsQuestionnaires were mailed to 1106 oxygen-dependent patients and HOT-prescribing physicians in Akita, near the <b>disaster-stricken</b> <b>area.</b> We investigated patients' actions when unable to use an oxygen concentrator and classified the patients based on oxygen cylinder use. Patients who experienced an interruption of or reduction in oxygen flow rate by their own judgment were assigned to the “interruption” and “reduction” groups, respectively; those who maintained their usual flow rate were assigned to the “continuation” group. Differences were tested using analysis of variance and the χ 2 tests. ResultsIn total, 599 patients responded to the questionnaire. Oxygen cylinders were supplied to 574 patients (95. 8 %) before their oxygen cylinders were depleted. Comparison of the continuation (n= 356), reduction (n= 64), and interruption (n= 154) groups showed significant differences in family structure (p= 0. 004), underlying disease (p= 0. 014), oxygen flow rate (p< 0. 001), situation regarding use (p< 0. 001), knowledge of HOT (p< 0. 001), and anxiety about oxygen supply (p< 0. 001). There were no differences in changes in physical condition. ConclusionsMost patients could receive oxygen cylinders after the disaster.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative, spiral-shaped, urease-producing {{bacterium}} {{with multiple}} unipolar flagella. Humans {{are a major}} reservoir for H. pylori; however, there are no data on the prevalence of H. pylori among dyspeptic patients who have experienced natural disasters. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to examine the prevalence of H. pylori in dyspeptic patients who survived a recent natural disaster and to compare the data between the pre-disaster and post-disaster periods. METHODS: Between December 2011 and February 2012 (&# 8764; one month following an earthquake), 209 dyspeptic patients who underwent gastroscopy were included in the study. For microorganism identification, gastric biopsy materials from the 209 disaster survivors with dyspeptic complaints were tested for urease activity in a medium containing urea and a pH indicator. The obtained results were compared with pre-disaster data from dyspeptic patients in the same city during the corresponding period of the previous year. Furthermore, the current H. pylori prevalence was evaluated among 139 dyspeptic patients between January 2014 and May 2014. RESULTS: We found a significantly higher prevalence of H. pylori in disaster survivors with dyspepsia compared with dyspeptic patients in the pre-disaster period (p< 0. 005). Interestingly, the current H. pylori prevalence was found to be significantly higher than the prevalence in both the disaster and pre-disaster periods (p< 0. 005). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a recent earthquake could contribute to the development of H. pylori infection in subjects who live in the <b>disaster-stricken</b> <b>area.</b> These data also highlight the exceptionally high H. pylori prevalence in dyspeptic patients.

The aim of this ecological study was to examine whether the rate of increase in disability prevalence among the older population was higher in <b>disaster-stricken</b> <b>areas</b> during the 3 years after the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) and tsunami. This analysis used public Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI) data covering 1570 municipalities. “Disaster areas” were considered to be the three prefectures most affected by the earthquake and tsunami: Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima. The outcome measure was the number of aged people (≥ 65 years) with LTCI disability certification. Rates of change in disability prevalence from January 2011 to January 2014 were used as the primary outcome variable, and compared by analysis of covariance between “coastal disaster areas”, “inland disaster areas” and “non-disaster areas”. The mean rate of increase in disability prevalence in coastal (14. 7 %) and inland (10. 0 %) disaster areas was higher than in non-disaster areas (6. 2 %) (P <  0. 001).
