50|$|The {{technology}} and market {{idea behind the}} foundation of NanGate was to address and solve the inherent shortcomings of standard cell based ASSP/ASIC design as compared to <b>full</b> <b>custom</b> <b>IC</b> design. In standard cell design the designer uses cells from a standard cell library to implement the desired logic functionality of the IC while trying to obtain the target operating frequency at the lowest possible cost in terms of die area and power consumption. The standard cells form the basic building blocks used to build the IC together with macro blocks such as embedded memory, Input-Output (IO), mixed-signal and analog blocks. Each standard cell represents a relatively primitive logic function, such as a NAND gate, with fixed area, timing and power characteristics and is constructed from transistors most often arranged in the pull-up/pull-down fashion of CMOS. A typical standard-cell library for e.g. 40 nanometer CMOS has 500-1500 standard cells and about 150-300 different logic functions.|$|E
40|$|A {{low power}} sparse scan readout {{architecture}} {{has been developed}} for the ATLAS pixel front-end IC. The architecture supports a dual discriminator and extracts the time over threshold (TOT) information along with a 2 -D spatial address $ 9 of the hits associating them with a unique 7 -bit beam crossing number. The IC implements level- 1 trigger filtering along with event building (grouping together all hits in a beam crossing) {{in the end of}} column (EOC) buffer. The $ 9 events are transmitted over a 40 MHz serial data link with the protocol supporting buffer overflow handling by appending error flags to events. This mixed-mode <b>full</b> <b>custom</b> <b>IC</b> is implemented in 0. 8 mu HP process to meet the $ 9 requirements for the pixel readout in the ATLAS inner detector.

40|$|Abstract. Mutual Information Analysis is {{a generic}} side-channel dis-tinguisher {{that has been}} {{introduced}} at CHES 2008. It aims to allow successful attacks requiring minimum assumptions {{and knowledge of the}} target device by the adversary. In this paper, we compile recent contri-butions and applications of MIA in a comprehensive study. From a the-oretical point of view, we carefully discuss its statistical properties and relationship with probability density estimation tools. From a practical point of view, we apply MIA in two of the most investigated contexts for side-channel attacks. Namely, we consider first order attacks against an unprotected implementation of the DES in a <b>full</b> <b>custom</b> <b>IC</b> and second order attacks against a masked implementation of the DES in an 8 -bit microcontroller. These experiments allow to put forward {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} this new distinguisher and to compare it with standard power analysis attacks using the correlation coefficient...|$|E

40|$|The {{thresholding}} of Surface ElectroMyoGraphic (sEMG) signals, i. e., Average Threshold Crossing (ATC) technique, {{reduces the}} amount of data to be processed enabling circuit complexity reduction and low power consumption. This paper investigates {{the lowest level of}} complexity reachable by an ATC system through measurements and in-vivo experiments with an embedded prototype for wireless force transmission, based on asynchronous Impulse-Radio Ultra Wide Band (IR-UWB). The prototype is composed by the acquisition unit, a wearable PCB 23 34 mm, which includes a <b>full</b> <b>custom</b> <b>IC</b> integrating a UWB transmitter (chip active silicon area 0. 016 mm, 1 mW power consumption), and the receiver. The system is completely asynchronous, it acquires a differential sEMG signal, generates the ATC events and triggers a 3. 3 GHz IR-UWB transmission. ATC robustness relaxes filters constraints: two passive first order filters have been implemented, bandwidth from 10 Hz up to 1 kHz. Energy needed for the single pulse generation is 30 pJ while the whole PCB consumes 5. 65 mW. The pulses radiated by the acquisition unit TX are received by a short-range and low complexity threshold-based 130 nm CMOS IR-UWB receiver with an Ultra Low Power (ULP) baseband unit capable of robustly receiving generic quasi-digital pulse sequences. The acquisition unit have been tested with 10 series of in vivo isometric and isotonic contractions, while the transmission channel with over-the-air and cable measurements obtained with a couple of planar monopole antennas and an integrated 0. 004 mm transmitter, the same used for the acquisition unit, with realistic channel conditions.

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 Digital {{design at}} the system level {{considers}} {{the implementation of a}} system with some mix of standard <b>ICs,</b> <b>custom</b> <b>ICs,</b> and software. In the early stages of design the system is described by a set of descriptions which may include software, hardware behavioral descriptions, and specifications for standard parts. The implementation implied by the initial set of descriptions, however, may not meet system performance goals (i. e. cost, throughput, physical size). The challenge of the early design stages, then, is to rework the set of descriptions into one whose implementation meets the performance goals. One possibility is to consider designing <b>custom</b> <b>ICs</b> for some parts of the system. This may be an attractive alternative when only a subset of the functionality of a standard IC is needed by the system, or when the standardIC implementation represents a poor use of PC board space (i. e. many SSI or MSI parts). This paper formalizes the tradeoff between using a <b>custom</b> <b>IC</b> and using standard ICs to implement part of a system. The new design tool described in this paper brings together system-level andbehavioral-level synthesis paradigms and is capable of designing microprocessor-based computer systems which include an ASIC.
