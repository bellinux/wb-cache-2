40|$|This {{research}} and development program was designed to improve nondestructive evaluation of large mechanical objects by providing both fast and thermal neutron sources for radiography. Neutron radiography permits inspection inside objects that x-rays cannot penetrate and permits imaging of corrosion and cracks in low-density materials. Discovering of fatigue cracks and corrosion in piping without the necessity of insulation removal is possible. Neutron radiography sources can provide for the nondestructive testing interests of commercial and military aircraft, public utilities and petrochemical organizations. Three neutron prototype neutron generators were designed and fabricated based on original research done at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The {{research and}} development of these generators was successfully continued by LBNL and Adelphi Technology Inc. under this STTR. The original design goals of high neutron yield and generator robustness have been achieved, using new technology developed under this grant. In one prototype generator, the fast neutron yield and brightness was roughly 10 times larger than previously marketed neutron generators using the same deuterium-deuterium reaction. In another generator, we integrate a moderator with a fast neutron source, resulting in a high brightness thermal neutron generator. The moderator acts as both conventional moderator and mechanical and electrical support structure for the generator and effectively mimics a nuclear reactor. In addition to the new prototype generators, an entirely new plasma ion source for neutron production was developed. First developed by LBNL, this source uses a spiral antenna to more efficiently couple the RF radiation into the plasma, reducing the required gas pressure so that the <b>generator</b> <b>head</b> can be completely sealed, permitting the possible use of tritium gas. This also permits the generator to use the deuterium-tritium reaction to produce 14 -MeV neutrons with increases of yield of two orders of magnitude. The first fast neutron radiographic images were obtained using neutron cameras and a new fast neutron generator. These early images demonstrated the feasibility of using fast neutrons for imaging and penetrating thick objects of high density and imaging. Fast neutrons can be used to image low atomic number materials (e. g. plastics, explosives, lubricants and ceramics) that are shielded by high density materials (e. g. lead, tungsten and uranium). Fast neutron radiography {{could be used as a}} means to screen weapons for flaws and chemical stability. X-ray radiography can not easily do this. Fast neutron imaging is technically difficult and, consequently, a completely undeveloped market. Two of the generators were designed to have small source size and high brightness, ideal for fast-neutron imaging. With these generators we successfully used two fast neutron cameras: one developed by us, and another developed by a collaborator, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, CSIRO. We have successfully used these cameras to obtain low resolution images of various objects such as pipe fittings filled with water and other mechanical objects. Higher resolution and contrast images are expected by decreasing the source size and increasing generator yield...|$|E

The 7S11 sampling unit ($1,780) was intended for a mainframe's vertical axis slot; it would take an S-series head, and that head would determine the bandwidth. The S-1 sampling head ($1,160 in 1983) had a 1 GHz bandwidth; the S-4 sampling head ($2,665) had a 25 ps risetime 12.4 GHz bandwidth traveling-wave sampler. The 7S11 would work in combination with the 7T11 ($4,460 in 1983) or 7T11A sampling sweep units as a time base. The 7T11 could trigger on a 1 GHz signal or it could synchronize to a 1 GHz to 12.4 GHz input.

Grs at 12 Hz using a <b>head</b> <b>generator</b> and spirometric data were measured in 62 children suspected of asthma before and 5 min after a 6 -min free run.

The hypothesis examined here is that DI provokes bronchodilation in children during exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). EIB was attested in 15 children aged 10 ± 3 year (mean±SD) by a decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) ⩾ 15 % from baseline after a free running test. The respiratory resistance {{was measured by the}} forced oscillation technique at 12 Hz using a <b>head</b> <b>generator</b> to vary transrespiratory pressure around the head. The airway {{response to}} DI was estimated by the effect on respiratory conductance (Grs), calculated as the reciprocal of respiratory resistance in inspiration. During EIB, DI induced a variable but significant increase in Grs, from 0. 085 ± 0. 023 to 0. 101 ± 0. 029 lhPa− 1 s− 1 (P= 0. 0003). The post- to pre-DI Grs ratio (1. 19 ± 0. 14) was found to correlate negatively with EIB-induced reduction in FEV 1 (P= 0. 02), forced vital capacity (FVC) (P= 0. 01) but not FEV 1 /FVC, i. e., DI induced more bronchodilation in those children with small EIB associated reduction in FVC.

Independent component analysis (ICA) decomposes ERP data into a number of components equal to the number of sensors. The derived components have distinct but not necessarily orthogonal scalp projections.

Three of these components were active only when the subject detected the targets, three other components only when the target went undetected, and one in both cases. Three additional components accounted for the steady-state brain response to a 39 -Hz background click train.

40|$|Rotations of {{the line}} of sight are mainly {{implemented}} by coordinated motion of the eyes and head. Here, we propose a model for the kinematics of three-dimensional (3 -D) head-unrestrained gaze-shifts. The model was designed to account for major principles in the known behavior, such as gaze accuracy, spatiotemporal coordination of saccades with vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), relative eye and head contributions, the non-commutativity of rotations, and Listing’s and Fick constraints for the eyes and head respectively. The internal design of the model was inspired by known and hypothesized elements of gaze control physiology. Inputs included retinocentric location of the visual target and internal representations of initial 3 -D eye and head orientation, whereas outputs were 3 -D displacements of eye relative to the head and head relative to shoulder. Internal transformations decomposed the 2 -D gaze command into 3 -D eye and head commands with the use of three coordinated circuits: 1) a saccade <b>generator,</b> 2) a <b>head</b> rotation <b>generator,</b> 3) a VOR predictor. Simulations illustrate that the model can implement: 1) the correct 3 -D reference frame transformations to generate accurate gaze shifts (despite variability in other parameters), 2) the experimentally verified constraints on static eye and head orientations during fixation, and 3) the experimentally observed 3 -D trajectories of eye and head motion during gaze-shifts.

The following conceptual hybrid systems have been identified as candidates for powering sub-surface oil and gas production operations: (1) PWR = Pressurized-Water Nuclear Reactor + Lead-Acid Battery; (2) FC 1 = Line for Surface O{sub 2 } + Well Head Gas + Reformer + PEMFC + Lead-Acid & Li-Ion Batteries; (3) FC 2 = Stored O 2 + Well Head Gas + Reformer + Fuel Cell + Lead-Acid & Li-Ion Batteries; (4) SV 1 = Submersible Vehicle + Stored O{sub 2 } + Fuel Cell + Lead-Acid & Li-Ion Batteries; (5) SV 2 = Submersible Vehicle + Stored O{sub 2 } + Engine or Turbine + Lead-Acid & Li-Ion Batteries; (6) SV 3 = Submersible Vehicle + Charge at Docking Station + ZEBRA & Li-Ion Batteries; (7) PWR TEG = PWR + Thermoelectric Generator + Lead-Acid Battery; (8) WELL TEG = Thermoelectric <b>Generator</b> + Well <b>Head</b> Waste Heat + Lead-Acid Battery; (9) GRID = Ocean Floor Electrical Grid + Lead-Acid Battery; and (10) DOC = Deep Ocean Current + Lead-Acid Battery...|$|R
40|$|The {{superior}} colliculus (SC) is {{a structure that}} is implicated in the control of visual orienting behaviors. The SC contains a motor map which encodes saccade vectors topographically. Small saccades are encoded rostrally, larger ones caudally. More recently, it was shown that the rostral part of the SC contains a specialized "fixation zone". A group of cells located in the rostral SC have been called SC fixation neurons (SCFNs). SCFNs via projections to "omni-pause" neurons (OPNs) seem {{to play an important}} role during fixation behavior by holding gaze on target for a certain period of time through inhibition of the gaze saccade generator. By comparison, the caudal SC generates saccadic commands via its direct connections to the gaze saccade <b>generator.</b> When the <b>head</b> is unrestrained, large gaze shifts are generally made with the contribution of eye and head (gaze = eye-in-head + head-in-space). For a gaze shift executed in one step, gaze, eye, and head trajectories are very stereotyped; each part of the trajectory is correlated in time to another. Consequently, it is difficult to relate brainstem cells activity to a specific trajectory. A differentiation between the trajectories can be obtained by the use of multiple-step gaze-shifts that cats often use naturally. Multiple-step gaze shifts are gaze displacements that are composed of a variable number of gaze saccades separated by periods of steady fixation. The main goal of this thesis was to relate cell activity of both SC cells and OPNs with specific features of the multiple-step gaze shifts. The study of SC cells during multiple-step gaze shifts revealed that neither SCFNs nor cells on the SC motor map encode the complex motor sequence of steps and plateaus in multiple step gaze shifts. They are concerned with keeping track of the difference between current gaze position and the final intended gaze destination independently of how the gaze displacement is achieved.

5000|$|In the {{original}} Friday the 13th, Alice came from California {{and was an}} aspiring artist. She {{got a job as}} a camp counselor at Crystal Lake, New Jersey. She left California to give herself a fresh start after she ended an affair with an older married man. There she began a relationship with middle-aged camp owner Steve Christy that ended badly, and she instead became interested in fellow counselor Bill. One by one, the counselors are stalked and killed, and Alice and Bill become concerned when they can't find the other counselors. After realizing that they are the only two left, they leave the main cabin to investigate, only to discover a bloody axe in Brenda's bed, the phones disconnected, and the cars unusable. When the power goes out, Bill is killed when he goes to find the <b>generator.</b> Alice then <b>heads</b> outside and calls out for him and finds his dead body pinned {{to the back of the}} door. Frightened, she heads back to the main cabin to hide. She sees a vehicle pull up; thinking it's Steve, she rushes out but instead sees a middle-aged woman named Pamela Voorhees, who reveals herself to be the mother of the drowned boy Jason Voorhees, blaming his death on the counselors not watching her son. She also reveals herself as the killer when she violently rushes toward Alice with her knife. A chase ensues with Mrs. Voorhees attempting to kill Alice, but she escapes to the shore of the lake. During the final struggle, Alice decapitates her with a machete. Afterwards, a shaken Alice boards a canoe and falls asleep. Just as she sees police arriving, a decomposing body of a young boy drags her underwater. She then awakens in a hospital, screaming. A police officer tells her the aftermath. When she asks about Jason, the officer replies with no evidence of any boy; Alice says: [...] "He's still there".|$|R
