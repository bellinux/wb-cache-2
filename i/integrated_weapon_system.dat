40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{military}} integrated platforms and weapon systems are completing a GPS receiver upgrade to the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) as mandated by CJCSI 6140. SAASM GPS receivers provide {{the next generation}} security architecture. Once fully operational, this architecture will provide the new capabilities of unclassified black keys, multiple user networks and extended GPS functions such as over-the-air-rekeying (OTAR), contingency recovery and signal authentication. The functions will largely be implemented through the satellite signals themselves. However, the on-orbit signals are not yet available. While qualified at the card level, these integrated navigation and weapon systems equipped with SAASM receivers could not be fully exercised at the operational system level to verify their overall integrated functionality. In order to fill this testing gap and gain the ability {{to check out the}} SAASM functionality of a fully <b>integrated</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>system,</b> the 746 th Test Squadron (746 TS) developed a mobile simulation asset that provides the necessary set of simulated SAASM test signals. These specialized signals can be fed to an unmodified, operationally-configured platform running on its own power without removing black boxes in order to exercise the SAASM functions while the platform is in the operational state. The asset is called the SAASM Integrated System Evaluator and Reporter (SAASM-ISER). The 746 TS has recently added GPS receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) functionality testing to this capability as well.

The concept of an aircraft being an <b>integrated</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>system</b> had proliferated, where sensors such as the radar would be more directly tied into navigation and <b>weapons</b> <b>systems.</b> de Havilland included this concept {{in the design of the}} Sea Vixen.

5|$|The {{culmination}} of Thor missile training was {{to participate in}} a missile launch. Originally it was intended that all Thor missile crews would carry out at least one launch, but it soon became apparent that the cost would be prohibitive. Nonetheless, 21 RAF crews visited the United States for training, culminating in operational training launches from Vandenberg. This was known as <b>Integrated</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>System</b> Training (IWST). The first of these launches was a launch codenamed Lions Roar. Despite the fact that a Thor missile had exploded on the launch pad just a few days before, the launch was viewed by dignitaries including Brigadier Godfrey Hobbs, the Director of Public Relations at the Ministry of Defence; Air Vice-Marshal Walter Sheen, the RAF commander at the British Joint Staff Mission; and Air Vice-Marshal Augustus Walker, the commander of No. 1 Group. After delays due to weather and technical problems, the missile was successfully launched on 16 April 1959. In all, there were nine IWST launches, the last of which, codenamed Red Caboose, was on 21 January 1960.|$|R

500|$|The {{exploits}} of the AIF at Gallipoli, {{and then on}} the Western Front, subsequently became central to the national mythology. In the years that followed much was made of ethos of the AIF, including its volunteer status and the quality of [...] "mateship". Yet many of the factors which had resulted in the AIF's success as a military formation were not exclusively Australian, with most modern armies recognising the importance of small-unit identity and group cohesion in maintaining morale. Many of the qualities that arguably defined the Australian soldier were also claimed by New Zealanders and Canadians as having been exhibited by their soldiers, whilst undoubtedly soldiers of the German, British and American armies also exhibited such traits, even if they were known by different terms. Objectively, the foundations of the AIF's performance {{were more likely to have}} been military professionalism based on [...] "discipline, training, leadership, and sound doctrine". While the volunteer status of the AIF has been seen by some to explain its military performance, it was by no means unique in this regard. The status of their enlistment made little difference against the artillery, machine-gun fire, and wire obstacles of modern industrial warfare at any rate. Equally, individual skill and morale proved to be less important than sound tactics, with effective fire and movement ultimately making the difference in 1918.
