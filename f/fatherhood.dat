At least six siblings in the family also settled {{in different parts of}} the United States and Central America. A number of accounts claim a relation to U.S. President George Washington, but this is not clearly explained.|$|E

Jay-Z and West's braggadocio lyrics exhibit themes of opulence, fame, materialism, power, and {{the burdens of}} success, {{as well as political}} and socioeconomic context. The album expresses other topics such as Jay-Z's thoughts on <b>fatherhood,</b> West's reflection on being deemed a social villain, and their success as performers. Music writers interpreted the subject matter to concern the rappers' plight as African Americans struggling with financial success in America.|$|E
5|$|Winter in America juxtaposes {{themes of}} nostalgic hope {{to the social}} {{problems}} of the early 1970s, particularly in the African-American community and inner cities. Also a prominent theme in Scott-Heron's lyrics is people's faith in their culture in a bleak, impoverished environment. The album features Scott-Heron's examination of maintaining one's cultural roots in a discouraging environment. Other themes include love, <b>fatherhood,</b> freedom, alcoholism, and political scandal. The themes of social disillusionment and the human condition featured on the album are also depicted on the Winter collage, representing the grim, sullen images of poverty, decay, and death in generally urban areas and ghettos. Created by artist Peggy Harris, the collage was featured on the original LP's inner sleeve and in the liner booklet of Winter in Americas CD reissue.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) and her husband, {{state senator}} Robert (Jack Coleman), welcome their new baby, also named Phillip. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Gabe all visit Angela at the hospital. According to Angela, {{the baby was}} born prematurely, but due to the size, Oscar deduces that Angela lied about the date of conception. Angela admits that the baby was {{conceived}} a month before her wedding, and makes them promise not to tell anyone. Suspecting that Dwight is the real father, Oscar breaks his promise and tells him when he arrives at the hospital in search of Gabe. Dwight barges in on Angela and her husband and begins thoroughly examining the child. When the senator leaves, Dwight confronts Angela about the child, claiming that it is his. She refutes his claim, but Dwight leaves satisfied, telling the attending nurse to call off the baby's circumcision, which the nonplussed nurse refuses to do. Upon returning to Dunder Mifflin he drops his dispute with Jim, since his self-assumed <b>fatherhood</b> has given him a new appreciation for the duties of parenthood. The episode ends with Dwight putting a decal on his car, in honor of his covert new family member.|$|E

25|$|All three Abrahamic {{religions}} {{were founded}} by men, so some scholars and psychologists have theorized {{that they may}} dramatize important themes around men's relationship with their fathers for the western world. Conversely, conservative theologians within these traditions, especially Christianity, see <b>fatherhood</b> itself modeled on God the Father.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fatherhood</b> also {{decreases}} {{testosterone levels}} in men, {{suggesting that the}} resulting emotional and behavioral changes promote paternal care. The way testosterone levels change {{when a child is}} in distress is indicative of fathering styles. If the levels reduce, then there is more empathy by the father than in fathers whose levels go up.|$|E
25|$|Dedicated to the {{well-being}} of children through positive paternal involvement, Gardner serves {{on the board of the}} National <b>Fatherhood</b> Initiative (NFI).

25|$|Studies have {{indicated}} that IVF mothers show greater emotional involvement with their child, and they enjoy motherhood more than mothers by natural conception. Similarly, studies {{have indicated}} that IVF fathers express more warmth and emotional involvement than fathers by adoption and natural conception and enjoy <b>fatherhood</b> more. Some IVF parents become overly involved with their children.|$|E
25|$|Flea {{appeared}} in the documentary The Other F Word, which aired on Showtime and was released through Oscilloscope Laboratories (a company founded by Adam Yauch). The documentary, which was directed by Andrea Blaugrund Nevins, focused on a generation of punk rockers, how they have handled <b>fatherhood,</b> and how they went from public rebel to domestic authority figure. Mark Hoppus, Jim Lindberg, Art Alexakis, and Mark Mothersbaugh were also featured.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposition}} {{was accepted}} by scrutiny in June 2006 and the matter referred to the Legislation Committee. In January 2007, following {{the introduction of the}} Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000 a case was bought before the Royal Court by a local lawyer who claimed that her illegitimate child was being discriminated against as he could not take the name of his father and that the <b>fatherhood</b> was not allowed to be recorded.|$|E
25|$|Characters {{who will}} {{figure in the}} defense of the {{mountain}} also come into more relief, such as the loner and Ottoman Army deserter Sarkis Kilikian (who suffered the loss of his entire family during the pogrom-like Hamidian massacres) and the former drillmaster, Chaush Nurhan. Indeed, Musa Dagh is presented as a microcosm of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Armenian life, as well as being a test not only of Bagradianâ€™s leadership but a test of his marriage and <b>fatherhood.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dalton {{has been}} with the show since season 4 and takes part in the vast {{majority}} of the show's main storylines. He has a strong relationship with Red, joining him on his regular fishing trips and taking part in many aspects of the Possum Lodge operations.

He generally tells people exactly what he thinks of them, even if it means offending them.|$|E
25|$|His {{relationship}} with Sherry was detached, {{in part because}} of his decision to abandon a medical career and also due to differences in their behavior. While still living with Sherry, he began an affair with a dental student named Jackie Medina, and she became pregnant with his child only a few months into the affair. After three years of marriage to Sherry, he left her to move in with Jackie and to prepare for <b>fatherhood.</b> Nine years elapsed before he and Sherry were legally divorced in 1986.|$|E
25|$|God's gift of freedom. They {{appreciated}} {{opportunities to}} exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the <b>fatherhood</b> of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the court}} case the Stone Roses {{separated}} themselves from Manchester's club culture and {{spent much of}} 1992 and 1993 travelling in Europe before starting work on their second album in mid-1993. Progress was slow, hampered by Brown's and Squire's new <b>fatherhood</b> {{and the death of}} several people close to the band. John Leckie ultimately left the project as the band would not sign a production contract. Afterwards the Stone Roses assumed production duties with engineer Simon Dawson at Rockfield Studios in Wales, where they spent 347 ten-hour days working on the album.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} <b>fatherhood</b> of God does {{appear in the}} Old Testament, but {{is not a major}} theme. While the view of God as the Father is used in the Old Testament, it only became a focus in the New Testament, as Jesus {{frequently}} referred to it. This is manifested in the Lord's prayer which combines the earthly needs of daily bread with the reciprocal concept of forgiveness. And Jesus' emphasis on his special relationship with the Father highlights the importance of the distinct yet unified natures of Jesus and the Father, building to the unity of Father and Son in the Trinity.|$|E
25|$|This {{doctrine}} of the Virgin Birth is often represented Christian art {{in terms of the}} annunciation to Mary by the Archangel Gabriel that she would conceive a child to be born the Son of God, and in Nativity scenes that include the figure of Salome. The Annunciation {{is one of the most}} frequently depicted scenes in Western art. Annunciation scenes also amount to the most frequent appearances of Gabriel in medieval art. The depiction of Joseph turning away in some Nativity scenes is a discreet reference to the <b>fatherhood</b> of the Holy Spirit, and the {{doctrine of}} Virgin Birth.|$|E
25|$|Baldwin chronicled his seven-year {{battle to}} remain {{a part of his}} daughter's life in his 2008 book, co-authored with Mark Tabb, A Promise to Ourselves: A Journey Through <b>Fatherhood</b> and Divorce. Baldwin contends that after their {{separation}} in December 2000, his former wife, Kim Basinger, endeavored to deny him access to his daughter by refusing to discuss parenting, blocking visitation, not providing telephone access, not following court orders, not dropping their daughter off for reasons of convenience, and directly lobbying the child. He contends that she spent over $1.5 million in the effort. Baldwin called this parental alienation syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Hammer {{signed a}} book {{contract}} with publishing company Simon & Schuster {{which called for}} a release the following year. However, a manuscript for an inspirational book called Enemies of the Father: Messages from the Heart on Being a Family Man (addressing the situation of African American men), for which Hammer received advance money to write, was never submitted in 2003. This resulted in Hammer being sued by the book company over claims that he never finished the book as promised. The company's March 2009 lawsuit sought return of the US$61,000 advance given to Hammer for the unwritten book about <b>fatherhood.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stephen Baskerville {{states that}} governments {{throughout}} the United States and other democracies are engaged, by accident or design, {{in a campaign}} against fathers and <b>fatherhood,</b> which in his view, lies {{at the root of}} a larger problem that threatens marriage, destroys families, devastates the lives of many children, and undermines parents, democracy and accountability. Baskerville also states that it is the removal of the father from the family through divorce that initiates problems for which the government is perceived as the solution rather than the problem, and that these problems are then used to justify the continued existence and expansion of the government. Members of the fathers' rights movement state that modern divorce involves government officials invading parents' private lives, evicting people from their homes, seizing their property, and taking away their children.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{preamble}} of the 1929 constitution as amended, the UNIA is a social, friendly, humanitarian, charitable, educational, institutional, constructive and expansive society, and is founded by persons desiring {{to do the}} utmost {{to work for the}} general uplift of the people of African ancestry of the world. And the members pledge themselves to do all in their power to conserve the rights of their noble race and to respect the rights of all mankind, believing always in the Brotherhood of Man and the <b>Fatherhood</b> of God. The motto of the organization is 'One God! One Aim! One Destiny!' Therefore, let justice be done to all mankind, realizing that if the strong oppresses the weak, confusion and discontent will ever mark the path of man but with love, faith and charity towards all the reign of peace and plenty will be heralded into the world and the generations of men shall be called Blessed.|$|E
25|$|Season three (2001â€“2002) sees Angel {{struggle}} with <b>fatherhood</b> when Darla returns pregnant with his child, {{despite the fact}} that vampires supposedly are unable to conceive. When Darla kills herself to give birth, Angel is left to raise the baby Connor (played by triplets Connor, Jake and Trenton Tupen) and protect him from those who wish {{to get their hands on}} a child of two vampires. False prophecies, time travel, and betrayal lead to Angel losing his infant son to an old enemy, Holtz (Keith Szarabajka), who abducts Connor into a hell dimension where time passes differently. Connor (Vincent Kartheiser) returns days later, fully grown and under the belief that Angel is a soulless monster. Holtz kills himself and Angel is framed for his death by Holtz's lover, prompting Connor to take revenge by sinking his father to the bottom of the ocean. Over the course of this season, Angel's friendship with his colleague Cordelia evolves into romance, but circumstances prevent him from confessing his feelings.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Farmer {{focused the}} efforts of the {{institution}} on BahÃ¡'Ã­ themes. In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place my feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the <b>Fatherhood</b> - BehÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me to look away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E
25|$|This {{socially}} conservative right-wing grouping {{is currently}} {{associated with the}} Cornerstone Group (or Faith, Family, Flag), and is the oldest tradition within the Conservative Party, closely associated with High Toryism. The name stems from its support for three British social institutions (though the Church is an English institution): the Church of England, the unitary British state and the family. To this end, it emphasises the country's Anglican heritage, oppose any transfer of power away from the United Kingdomâ€“either downwards to the nations and regions or upwards to the European Unionâ€“and seek to place greater emphasis on traditional family structures to repair what it sees as a broken society in the UK. It is a strong advocate of marriage and believes the Conservative Party should back the institution with tax breaks and have opposed the alleged assaults on both traditional family structures and <b>fatherhood.</b> Most oppose high levels of immigration and support the lowering of the current 24â€‘week abortion limit. Some members {{in the past have}} expressed support for capital punishment. Prominent MPs from this wing of the party include Andrew Rosindell, Nadine Dorries, Sir Edward Leigh and Jacob Rees-Mogg â€“the latter two being prominent Roman Catholics, notable in a faction marked out by its support for the established Church of England. The conservative English philosopher Sir Roger Scruton is a representative of the intellectual wing of the traditionalist group: his writings rarely touch on economics and instead focus on conservative perspectives concerning political, social, cultural and moral issues.|$|E
25|$|Naomi and Liam {{start their}} {{relationship}} fresh. Naomi admits to Liam {{that she has}} been feigning interest in things he likes and that she needs to be true to herself, even if it means their relationship won't work. This is what Liam wants, and their relationship becomes more stable; however, when Naomi is forced to come clean over false rumors she spread claiming that she was sexually harassed by a teacher, Mr. Cannon, Liam decides that he needs a break from her. During this time, Annie and Liam become closer and he consoles her after she overhears her mother, Debbie, confessing to her father, Harry, that she kissed her yoga instructor. His consolation causes Annie to believe that Liam is flirting with her, but realizing that this was not his intent, Annie instead advises Liam to stay with Naomi, as she does not want to ruin her friendship again over a boy. Liam begins to have his own troubles when his father returns, pretending that he wants to have a relationship with his son. But when Liam steals very valuable coins from his stepfather in hopes of starting a life with his father, he abandons Liam. Naomi becomes distracted by her pregnant sister Jen returning to town and causing trouble for Naomi. Naomi finds out that Ryan is the father of Jen's baby, and informs him of his impending <b>fatherhood.</b> Jen does not want Ryan {{to have anything to do}} with the future of their baby, but Ryan is insistent that he should be involved. After Liam breaks up with her, a devastated Naomi is raped by Mr. Cannon, who tells her that after her initial false accusations, nobody will believe her. Mr. Cannon and Naomi had been working on a digital media project when they had become close and worked after hours on a project. This is also when Naomi was attacked by Mr. Cannon. Dixon leaves for Australia with Ivy after witnessing his parents having another argument. Harry informs Debbie that he was fired as principal of West Beverly after covering up an incident at school for Dixon. Annie reveals to Liam about the hit-and-run, and he encourages her to confess. Jasper is jealous that Annie and Liam are spending so much time together and sets fire to Liam's boat that he has been working on for a very long time.
