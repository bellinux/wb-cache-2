The third and fourth problems were "inadequate knowledge of the farmers in grading jute fibre" with problem index 339 and "no price incentive for quality fibre at primary market" with problem index 320 and rank order 3 and 4 respectively. Farmers do not receive remunerative prices due to high quality fibres in primary market. Because of non-availability of high yielding variety (HYV) jute seeds on the sowing period, farmers are not interested in HYV jute cultivation. "Farmers inability to purchase costly seed" and "lack of adequate knowledge of improved technologies on jute cultivation" had a problem index of 278 and 255 respectively. During the sowing period, price of HYV jute seed becomes high and goes beyond the purchasing capacity of small farmers.

The Rent Act 1965 extended security of tenure, introduced registration of rents, and protection from eviction for private tenants, making illegal the harassment of tenants. This legislation was attributed to fall in number of homeless families taken into welfare accommodation each year in the LCC area, from 2,000 in 1962-64 to 1,300 in 1965 and 1,500 in 1966. The Leasehold Reform Act 1967 was passed in order to enable holders of long leases to purchase the freehold of their homes. This legislation provided about one million leaseholders with the right to purchase the freehold of their homes. Controls were introduced over increases in the rents of council accommodation, a new Rent Act 1965 froze the rent for most unfurnished accommodation in the private sector while providing tenants with greater security of tenure and protection against harassment, and a system was introduced whereby independent arbitrators had the power to <b>fix</b> <b>fair</b> rents. In addition, the First Wilson government encouraged the introduction of discretionary local authority rent rebates to assist with housing costs, and also initiated the possibility of paying rates by instalments. In November 1969, legislation was passed by the government limiting rent rises following anti-eviction protests.|$|R

60|$|Rents {{could not}} be paid, and landlords either would not or could not reduce them. In the deepest {{interests}} of social order, and in confirmation of the tenant’s equitable and customary ownership, the only course open to the imperial legislature was to erect machinery for <b>fixing</b> <b>fair</b> rents. The alternative to what became matter of much objurgation as dual ownership, was a single ownership that was only a short name for allowing the landlord to deal as he liked with the equitable interest of the tenant. Without the machinery set up by Mr. Gladstone, {{there could be no}} security {{for the protection of the}} cultivator’s interest. What is more, even in view of a wide and general extension of the policy of buying out the landlord and turning the tenant into single owner, still a process of valuation for purposes of fair price would have been just as indispensable, as under the existing system was the tiresome and costly process of valuation for purposes of fair rent. It is true that if the policy of purchase had been adopted, this process would have been performed once for all. But opinion was not nearly ready either in England or Ireland for general purchase. And as Mr. Gladstone had put it to Bright in 1870, to turn a little handful of occupiers into owners would not have touched the fringe of the case of the bulk of the Irish cultivators, then undergoing acute mischief and urgently crying for prompt relief. Mr. Bright’s idea of purchase, moreover, assumed that the buyer would come with at least a quarter of the price in his hand,—an assumption not consistent with the practical possibilities of the case.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An untraceable fair network payment {{protocol}} {{is proposed}} by Wang in Asiacrypt’ 03, which employs the existent {{techniques of the}} offline untraceable cash and a new technique called restrictive confirmation signature scheme (RCSS). It is claimed that the fair payment protocol has both the fairness such that the buyer obtains the digital goods {{if and only if}} the merchant gains the digital cash and the untraceability and unlinkability such that no one can tell who is the original owner of the money. In this paper we show that the fairness is breached under a simple colluding attack, by which a dishonest merchant can obtain the digital money without the buyer obtaining the goods. We also apply the attack to some of the schemes of fair exchange of digital signatures proposed by Ateniese in ACM CCS’ 99. Our study shows that two of them are subjected to the attack. A countermeasure against the attack is proposed for the fair exchange of digital signatures. However, we are unable to <b>fix</b> the <b>fair</b> payment protocol if the untraceability and unlinkability are the required features. ...|$|R

However, it reserved to the owner his right to possession for actual bona fide occupancy, as in to provide a home for himself and his relatives. This right was conditioned on the tenant being given a 30 days' notice to vacate the premises. The statute declared that its provisions were made necessary due to emergencies growing out of the war, and limited its duration to a period of two years.|$|R
