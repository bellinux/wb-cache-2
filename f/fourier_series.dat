5|$|<b>Fourier</b> <b>series</b> {{are used}} to solve {{boundary}} value problems in partial differential equations. In 1822, Fourier first used this technique to solve the heat equation. A discrete version of the <b>Fourier</b> <b>series</b> {{can be used in}} sampling applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the <b>Fourier</b> <b>series</b> is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points. The set of coefficients is known as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT {{is one of the key}} tools of digital signal processing, a field whose applications include radar, speech encoding, image compression. The JPEG image format is an application of the closely related discrete cosine transform.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in {{practice}} {{one wants to}} approximate the function with {{a finite number of}} terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively. In the case of the Taylor series the error is very small in a neighbourhood of the point where it is computed, while it may be very large at a distant point. In the case of the <b>Fourier</b> <b>series</b> the error is distributed along the domain of the function.|$|E
5|$|In {{physical}} terms the function is {{represented as a}} superposition of sine waves and the coefficients give information about the function's frequency spectrum.

Applied to the group R, it yields the classical Fourier transform; an application in physics are reciprocal lattices, where the underlying group is a finite-dimensional real vector space endowed with the additional datum of a lattice encoding positions of atoms in crystals.|$|E

5|$|The {{convergence}} of both series has very different properties.

Concerning the <b>Fourier</b> <b>series,</b> if the function is square-integrable then the series converges in quadratic mean, but additional requirements are needed to ensure the pointwise or uniform convergence (for instance, if the function is periodic and of class C1 then the convergence is uniform).|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} one of a series on error {{analysis}} and correction of finite element solutions for plates and shells. The error analysis in the earlier papers used half-range double <b>Fourier</b> sine <b>series</b> for numerical harmonic analysis. The half-range formulas are simple to apply, but they can be inaccurate near the ends of the ranges of the independent variables. The Gibbs' phenomenon exhibited by half-range sine series in one independent variable has a two-dimensional analog; a classic example is the Navier solution in a double half-range sine series for the simply supported plate under a uniform load. A simple change of variables is introduced in the paper to improve the accuracy of the double <b>Fourier</b> sine <b>series</b> without adding complexity to the numerical analysis. The change of variables is applied to the problem of approximating a transverse load that is tabulated on a rectangular grid.
