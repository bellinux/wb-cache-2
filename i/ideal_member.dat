5000|$|In {{the culture}} of ancient Greece, the term paideia (also spelled paedeia) ( [...] ; παιδεία) {{referred}} to the rearing and education of the <b>ideal</b> <b>member</b> of the polis. It incorporated both practical, subject-based schooling and a focus upon the socialization of individuals within the aristocratic order of the polis. The practical aspects of this education included subjects subsumed under the modern designation of the liberal arts (rhetoric, grammar and philosophy are examples), as well as scientific disciplines like arithmetic and medicine. An ideal and successful member of the polis would possess intellectual, moral and physical refinement, so training in gymnastics and wrestling was valued for {{its effect on the}} body alongside the moral education which the Greeks believed was imparted by the study of music, poetry and philosophy. This approach to the rearing of a well-rounded Greek male was common to the Greek-speaking world, with the exception of Sparta where a rigid and militaristic form of education known as the agoge was practiced.|$|E

5000|$|In formal axiology, Robert S. Hartman {{contended that}} being ideal means that {{something}} is the best member of the set of all things of that class. For example, the ideal student is the best member of the set of all students {{in exactly the same}} way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since we can define the properties that the <b>ideal</b> <b>member</b> of a class should have, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is. For example, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is not as [...] "good" [...] as a very smooth one drawn with a compass. In the world in general, each particular object ought to become more like its ideal. In ethics, by analogy, each person should attempt to become more of an ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self.|$|E
5000|$|Imperiex {{appears in}} the Legion of Super Heroes {{animated}} series, voiced by Phil Morris. The character was deemed {{to be a big}} enough threat to be used as the primary villain for the entire second season, but enough of a blank slate that his [...] "real" [...] DC Universe history could be modified for the TV version. As opposed to his comic-book incarnation, this Imperiex relies on physical, direct combat. He can fly, is stronger than Superman and is, for the most part, virtually indestructible. The only time he is vulnerable to few, if any kind of head-on attack is when he uses a cannon mounted in his chest, which is also his most powerful weapon, but even using that weakness against him only succeeds in defeating him for a few minutes. In addition, he has extendable claws and he wields a pair of powerful swords that can fire out waves of energy. He also knows how to create and control armies of Destructo-Bots and is exceptionally intelligent and cunning, evident by {{the fact that some of}} his Destructo-Bots are shown to know how to take their enemies down with them. In the show, Imperiex was originally an alien (presumably from the planet Apokolips) who was raised in a gladiator lifestyle; over time he had his body modified by technology that had been created by a scientist named Abel, that allowed a perfect union of organic tissue with cybernetics, until nothing remained of his original self. In the 41st century, Imperiex had conquered most of the universe and wiped out nearly all resistance that stands in his way, with a clone of Superman named Kell-El among the forces left to oppose him. Unable to stop Imperiex, Kell-El travels back to the 31st century to recruit the Legion of Superheroes to help stop Imperiex. Although Brainiac 5 comes up with a plan that appears to stop him by taking advantage of his weak point, Imperiex is able to take the device Kell-El used to travel through time and use it to escape to the 31st century. There, he secretly frees the Fatal Five and the Legion of Super-Villains from prison, recruiting Validus. He hacks into Computo, downloading information about the Legion's arsenal at the time as well as acquiring some data that he offers to the Dominion. Outside of Validus, the Dominion, and his Destructo-Bots, Imperiex works with and recruits villains such as Mekt Ranzz, Ron-Karr, and Grimbor the Chainsman to aid him, although he was perplexed by those villains when they left him. In [...] "Unnatural Alliances," [...] the cybernetic villain Terra-Man targets a younger Abel which Imperiex couldn't allow. In the final fight with Terra Man, Superman X and Imperiex agree to work together to destroy Terra Man. In [...] "Message in a Bottle," [...] Imperiex and his armies invaded the Fortress of Solitude so he could steal [...] "The Messenger" [...] from the shrunken city of Kandor. Brainiac 5 was forced to tap into his ancestor's knowledge and use it to turn the sun yellow, allowing the Kandorians to fight back and cause Imperiex's army to retreat. However, it turned out that Imperiex intended for Brainiac 5 to do that in order for him to succumb to the original Brainiac's influence and become an <b>ideal</b> <b>member</b> of his campaign. When this plan succeeded, he did a transmission to the Legion of Super Heroes stating that Brainiac 5 has joined up with him. During the transmission, Imperiex ultimately ends up being impaled by Brainiac 1.0 (in Brainiac 5's body) who thanked him for his part of bringing him back, but that he was no longer of any use to him. He then uses the metal of his body he impaled Imperiex with to kill him in a violent unseen way, robbing Kell-El the chance of killing the tyrant himself.|$|E

40|$|Only an {{interpretation}} of Reinhold Niebuhr which consistently adheres to the ideal/real dialectical structure intrinsic to his hermeneutics of myth does justice to the tensions inherent in his thought. The failure to preserve this dialectical tension results in one group of scholars regarding his christology as determinative and a larger group giving his anthropology this position. Therefore, the structure of his thought is better illustrated as an ellipse having two foci rather than a single-centered circle. Niebuhr's characterization of the ideal/real nature of this dialectical tension, however, implies that {{the truth of the}} former member is perspectival and the latter established upon more empirical grounds. The absence of metaphysical assertions about the <b>ideal</b> <b>member</b> of the dialectic ultimately requires that Christianity be interpreted from a relativistic perspective without criteria for asserting Christianity as unique in any but a personal existential fashion...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor {{structural}} optimization problems, such as {{the weight}} minimization of steel framed structures, the sizing design variables are often defined as the cross-sectional areas of the members, which are to be chosen from commercially available tables such as those provided by the American Institute of Steel Construction.

5000|$|Putnam's {{frustration}} with the changing role of social ties in civic engagement and social capital formation pre-dates {{the rise of the}} internet, but strongly mirrors Evgeny Morozov's criticism about low-effort acts of social engagement. As noted by Putnam in [...] "Bowling Alone", mass membership organizations like The Sierra Club and American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) are significantly different from civic associations and other venues for collective action of the past. These mass membership organizations, Putnam argues, allow members to be very loosely connected, perhaps only by shared values or <b>ideals.</b> <b>Members</b> may never knowingly encounter another member of the organization and their ties are to the organization’s principles and not to one another as in traditional civic groups. Membership in such mass membership organizations may solely consist of writing a check or reading a newsletter and not sustained or more in-depth actions, which may facilitate more active engagement leading to a higher propensity for social change.|$|R

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to a discussion of pragmatism’s political impulses. It concentrates on the hitherto somewhat neglected question of pragmatism and race. In order to elucidate one possibility of approaching this complex question, the article discusses James Baldwin’s essays. It is argued that Baldwin’s essays can be used to show the significance of a middle ground between Cornel West’s prophetic pragmatism and Richard Rorty’s liberal version of neopragmatism. While the first part analyzes West’s prophetic and worldly pragmatism, the second part seeks to illuminate Rorty’s notion of a pragmatist literary or poeticized culture. The final part demonstrates that while it would be pointless to claim that Baldwin is a radically postmetaphysical author and thus an <b>ideal</b> <b>member</b> of a literary culture, his politicized version of self-creation makes it seem legitimate to advance the argument that he is part of a left-liberal tradition of worldly pragmatism that sees the work of the strong poet or creative redescriber as contributing to political and social change...|$|E
40|$|This paper first reviews three {{different}} theoretical constructs concerning the psychological significance of sex role related characteristics in personal-ity functioning: sex role identity, androgyny, and sex role transcendence. A new conceptual analysis concerning sex-typing, sex role strain analysis, is presented. According to this analysis, {{the relationship between}} sex role related personality characteristics and psychological adjustment, especially self-esteem, is moderated by two variables: perception of the <b>ideal</b> <b>member</b> of the same sex, and sex role salience. These two variables; taken in con-junction with real self-concept, generate five sex role strain outcomes. The constructs of sex role identity, androgyny, and sex role transcendence are interpreted {{in terms of this}} sex role strain analysis. The implications of this analysis for current research and for understanding the dynamics of both individual and social change in sex roles are briefly described. The goal of this paper i s to present a new analysis of the relation-ship between personality characteristics traditionally associated with one sex or the other and psychological adjustment, especially self-esteem. This analysis, termed here sex role strain analysis, integrates disparate elements in previous theory and research in this area and suggests new directions for future research. To set the stage for this analysis, we first briefly review three major psychological constructs concerning the significance of sex role related personality charac-teristics: sex role identity, androgyny, and sex role transcendence.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of nursing care in a hospital setting is mobilizing patients. Numerous studies have documented that prolonged bed rest is associated with negative patient outcomes. An ambulation program can assist patients to maintain functional status during the hospital stay in preparation for discharge. Nurses are the member {{of the health care}} team with responsibility for mobilizing patients. In order to do this successfully, nurses require updated knowledge related to implementing an ambulation program. Several factors facilitate ambulating patients on a regular basis, including adequate staffing, appropriate equipment, and availability of a mobility protocol. The purpose of the project was to develop and implement an educational program for nursing staff regarding ambulation of medical-surgical patients in the hospital setting. First, a comprehensive needs assessment was conducted; concurrently, a recently formed Task Force developed a mobility protocol. A two hour educational program was developed based on the literature and clinical experience, with a focus on the negative consequences of immobility in the hospital setting, patient assessments in relation to mobility, the benefits of mobilizing patients, {{and the role of the}} nurse and the Physical Therapist with mobilizing patients. The program was implemented and included administration of pre and post surveys and a program evaluation. Results indicated a ten point improvement in knowledge scores from the pre to the post survey, and staff positively evaluated the program. The Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN), especially the Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) can play a major role in formally and informally educating nursing staff related to ambulation as well as in development, implementation, and evaluation of a mobility protocol. Further research regarding what is ‘optimal’ mobility in various health care settings is critically needed.
