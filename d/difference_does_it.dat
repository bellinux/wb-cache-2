Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E
500|$|... "Hand in Glove" [...] was {{released}} as the Smiths' debut recording in May 1983. The single sold consistently {{for the next}} 18 months. Although the single failed to reach the UK Singles Chart, it reached number three on the UK Indie Chart. Its relative success earned the group a listing in the Guinness Book of Records in January 1984 when it and the group's next two singles' [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and [...] "What <b>Difference</b> <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> Make?"' held the top three position on the UK Indie Chart. [...] "It {{should have been a}} massive hit", Morrissey later said, [...] "it was so urgent. To me, it was a complete cry in every direction. It really was a landmark." [...] The single did raise the band's profile; a week after its release the band gained its first major live reviews in the music press, which in turn led to their first radio session with BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel.|$|E

In 1984 the band reached number twelve in the UK with the single [...] "What <b>Difference</b> <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> Make?"

The Smiths' next six singles all went to higher than number thirty in the UK, and their third album, The Queen Is Dead (1986), climbed to number two in the UK.|$|E

Just weeks later the crisis evaporated: in January 1991 the President requested, and Congress passed, a joint resolution formally approving the war.

2500|$|In 1984, English band The Smiths {{released}} {{their third}} single, [...] "What <b>Difference</b> <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> Make?". The single cover was a photograph {{taken on the}} set of the film The Collector (but not depicted in the actual film). Originally, Stamp refused permission for the still to be used, and some pressings featured lead singer Morrissey in a re-enacted scene. In the re-enactment Morrissey is holding a glass of milk, as opposed to a chloroform pad in the original. Eventually, however, Stamp changed his mind, and the original cover was reinstated.|$|E

[...] The press focused on Milo for much of his early life, reporting on 'milestones' such as his first birthday and first day at school.

2500|$|The group's cover artwork had a {{distinctive}} visual style and often featured images {{of film and}} pop stars, usually in duotone. Design was by Morrissey and Rough Trade art coordinator Jo Slee. The covers of singles rarely featured any text other than the band name, and the band itself did not appear {{on the cover of}} any UK release. (Morrissey did, however, appear on an alternative cover for [...] "What <b>Difference</b> <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> Make?", mimicking the pose of the original subject, British actor Terence Stamp, after the latter objected to his picture being used.) The choice of cover subjects reflected Morrissey's interest in cult film stars (Stamp, Alain Delon, Jean Marais, Warhol protégé Joe Dallesandro, James Dean); figures from sixties British popular culture (Viv Nicholson, Pat Phoenix, Yootha Joyce, Shelagh Delaney); and anonymous images from old films and magazines.|$|E

In the morning, however, {{when he saw the}} other man's pale, closed, rather haughty face, he {{realised}} that something had happened. Lilly was courteous and even affable: but with a curious cold space between him and Aaron. Breakfast passed, and Aaron knew that he must leave. There was something in Lilly's bearing which just showed him the door. In some surprise and confusion, and in some anger, not unmingled with humorous irony, he put his things in his bag. He put on his hat and coat. Lilly was seated rather stiffly writing.|$|R

2500|$|The Israeli Forum for the Promotion of Equal Share in the Burden {{threatened}} {{to boycott the}} fashion chain Fox if they hired Refaeli. The two sides reached a compromise in which Refaeli agreed to visit injured IDF soldiers whenever she is in Israel, and actively encourage enlistment in the army. Refaeli later said, [...] "I don't regret not enlisting, because it paid off big time. That's {{just the way it}} is: celebrities have other needs. I hope my case has influenced the army." [...] She also said: [...] "Israel or Uganda, what <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> make? It makes no difference to me. Why is it good to die for our country?

2500|$|In {{a minute}} to the Cabinet's Defence and Overseas Policy {{committee}} the following month, Lamont set out his three objectives for the negotiations: first, to ensure Britain didn't have to join the single currency; second, to ensure the opt-out was legally water-tight; and third, to ensure that during the period {{in the run-up to}} the single currency, there should be no binding obligations on Britain. [...] In meeting the third of these, Lamont had to overcome the resistance of the prime minister and the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, who told Lamont: [...] "I can't see what you are so worked up about. We are in the ERM. What <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> make if it is in the Treaty?" [...] Lamont decided to ignore their objections. At the next negotiating meeting on the treaty, he told his fellow European finance ministers that Britain would not accept membership of the ERM as a treaty obligation. As a result, the meeting agreed to remove it.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1982 {{the band}} {{recorded}} their second demo, {{this time at}} the Drone Studios in Chorlton-cum-Hardy; the tracks recorded were [...] "What <b>Difference</b> <b>Does</b> <b>it</b> Make?", [...] "Handsome Devil", and [...] "Miserable Lie". They had intended for this demo to serve as their audition tape for the record company EMI, but on hearing it the latter turned the band down. During {{the rest of that}} month, the band continued to practice, this time at the upstairs of the Portland Street Crazy Grace Clothing company, a space secured for them by their new manager Joe Moss. By Christmas they had created four new songs: [...] "These Things Take Time", [...] "What Do You See in Him?", [...] "Jeane", and [...] "A Matter of Opinion", the last of which they would soon scrap. Their next gig was Manchester's Manhattan in late January 1983, and although Maker would again appear as a go-go dancer, this was the last time that he did so. In early February they performed their third gig, at the city's Haçienda club.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the untold}} {{stories in the}} {{proliferation}} of independent media across Africa {{is the role of}} donor aid in this process. Overview This year, 2014, marks 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the symbolic end of the Cold War in 1989. It also marks the anniversary of the beginning of an extraordinary proliferation of media outlets in sub-Saharan Africa, which swept across the continent, freeing Africa’s press and liberating the airwaves from monopoly by the state. Economics, technology, and socio-political forces all played major roles in this boom of Africa’s media. But one of the untold stories of these changes is the role of donor aid in this process. This is the subject of the Center for International Media Assistance’s latest report, Africa’s Media Boom: The Role of International Aid, by veteran international media consultant Mary Myers. It explores these questions: 	How much of a catalyst were foreign donors in this mushrooming of Africa’s news media? 	What were the motives and mechanisms of this aid? 	What <b>difference</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> make at the time, and subsequently? 	Was media proliferation necessarily a good thing–did it lead to pluralism and genuine freedom...|$|R
