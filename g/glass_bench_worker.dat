40|$|Graybel (a fictitious name {{used for}} privacy reasons) {{is a large}} {{developer}} of pharmaceuticals. Graybel's Antibody Protein Engineering Group (APEG) is responsible for early stage drug development of biotherapeutic molecules. Part of this responsibility is delivering high quality molecules while meeting tight deadlines. Across the industry there is constant pressure to decrease timelines, {{while at the same}} time the complexity of molecules is increasing. In order to meet this challenge, APEG must be highly adaptable. Unfortunately, unanticipated biology, long project lead times, unpredictable workflows and inadequate workflow tracking systems make it difficult to precisely determine what causes delays. This uncertainty, combined with the inability to quickly pilot changes to process or methodology, makes each potential change both risky and costly. The goal of this project was to provide APEG with two things: the knowledge needed to build a robust workflow tracking system and simulations that would assist in finding root causes of issues and allow for low-cost piloting of potential solutions. Combined, a workflow tracking database and decision tool would greatly reduce the risk associated with implementing changes, allowing APEG to adapt to meet increasingly difficult industry standards. Multiple avenues were used to collect the data needed on APEG's workflow. The primary source of data is interviews, with both management and experienced <b>bench</b> <b>workers.</b> These interviews provided data on workflow paths and estimates for workflow stage durations that could not be found elsewhere. In addition, they provided a way for APEG members to be involved in the project. Additional data was gathered from rudimentary systems that are used to track workflow within some functional groups. This data was then used to create detailed process maps, and simulations. Once validated, simulation results were analyzed and experimented with to determine current bottlenecks, potential future issues and possible fixes for these problems. In addition, a new metric was introduced for quantitatively evaluating the difficulty of a project called the Technology Readiness Level (TRL). Essential project decisions were identified, and recommendations made to track those issues. Bottlenecks were identified through queue analysis. Potential changes to fix these and other issues were piloted to determine effect. Future states, both with and without these changes, were simulated to determine potential problems. From this, causes of current and potential future delay were identified and recommendations developed. Recommendations included staffing changes, cross training, real-life piloting and developing a deeper understanding of certain processes. by Katherine A. D. Davis. Thesis: M. B.

40|$|This Inventions and Innovations program {{supported}} {{the technical and}} commercial research and development needed to elevate Ceralink's energy saving process for flat <b>glass</b> lamination from <b>bench</b> scale to a self-supporting technology with significant potential for growth. Radio-frequency heating was any un-explored option for laminating glass prior to this program. With significant commercial success through time and energy savings in the wood, paper, and plastics industries, RF heating {{was found to have}} significant promise for the energy intensive glass lamination industry. A major technical goal of the program was to demonstrate RF lamination across a wide range of laminate sizes and materials. This was successfully accomplished, dispelling many skeptics' concerns about the abilities of the technology. Ceralink laminated panels up to 2 ft x 3 ft, with four sets processed simultaneously, in a 3 minute cycle. All major categories of interlayer materials were found to work with RF lamination. In addition to laminating glass, other materials including photovoltaic silicon solar cells, light emitting diodes, metallized glass, plastics (acrylic and polycarbonate), and ceramics (alumina) were found compatible with the RF process. This opens up a wide range of commercial opportunities beyond the initially targeted automotive industry. The dramatic energy savings reported for RF lamination at the bench scale were found to be maintained through the scale up of the process. Even at 2 ft x 3 ft panel sizes, energy savings are estimated to be at least 90 % compared to autoclaving or vacuum lamination. With targeted promotion through conference presentations, press releases and internet presence, RF lamination has gained significant attention, drawing large audiences at American Ceramic Society meetings. The commercialization success of the project includes the establishment of a revenue-generating business model for providing process development and demonstrations for potential RF lamination users. A path to industrial energy benefits and revenue through industrial equipment sales was established in a partnership with Thermex Thermatron, a manufacturer of RF equipment...|$|R
5000|$|Similar {{disturbances}} occurred {{just over}} a year later when there were about 490 inmates in the workhouse, 120 of whom were able-bodied men. Amongst the latter some dissatisfaction had been expressed that the quantity of food allowed them was so little. However, accepting a good deal of grumbling, things went on tolerably well until the evening of 9 February 1851. The inmates finished their supper at a little before seven, and the governor having said grace, one of the men gave a signal, and instantly about forty of them commenced a furious attack on a wooden partition that divided them from the females' ward. The governor, schoolmaster, and three police officers attempted to restore order but they were pelted with objects, one of the constables having his eye seriously damaged by a stone. The porter was struck to the ground and brutally kicked, and the superintendent of labour made, after a vain resistance, an attempt to make his escape. At about seven o'clock, the inmates took charge of the establishment and began demolishing the building. <b>Glass,</b> window-frames, <b>benches,</b> floors, tables, chairs, clocks, etc. were ruthlessly smashed. The provision stores were ransacked, the cooked meat was eaten, and the raw meat was quickly cooked and devoured. The wines speedily disappeared, and the stores of beer were either drunk or smashed. Emboldened by drink, the inmates wrenched the fastenings from the doors, stripped the roofs of tiles, tore up the brick stone floorings, and made a large breach in a substantial brick wall. Having provided themselves with a good stock of missiles, they showered them over the walls upon any who might happen to be near. At about nine o'clock the Rev. F. Steward, a Magistrate, rode off to Ipswich for a detachment of the military. Troops were soon mustered, and by a little past ten o’clock, they’d galloped to the scene of action. Captain Peel was in command, but he would not permit his men to dismount — it being contrary to regulations — the consequence was that the force at that time was of no use. About five policemen attended, and it was nearly twelve o'clock before another body arrived; it consisted of eight men, under Mr. Jukes. At this time, the inmates had been in complete control over the premises for five hours, and besides affecting the damage described, they had burnt the governor's account books. The whole police force was soon mustered, and by the aid of a battering ram the door was forced open. The constables drew their cutlasses (A short heavy sword with a curved single-edged blade), supported by two or three others and rushed upon the rioters. After discharging one or two sharp volleys of bricks, stones, and glass, the rioters retreated in all directions and a hot pursuit ensued for ten minutes, the scene was an exciting one. Every place was scoured, and the prisoners, when captured, were hurried out of the building and placed under the guard of the military. Many of them were intoxicated, and one strong noisy fellow after he had been turned out exclaimed, pointing to the building, [...] "That is hell, and there they lead us to hell. God Almighty is on my side, and he'll protect me!" [...] The prisoners were ultimately placed in the strong room. The military returned to Ipswich at three o'clock. The next morning, many of the inmates insisted their sole cause of complaint was want of sufficient food. One of them said, [...] "Hunger is a sharp thorn, and it is enough to make us do what we would not." [...] A total of thirty-eight of the protestors were taken into custody. Eight of the men identified by the governor as having begun the riot were committed for trial at the next Ipswich Quarter Sessions, on the charge of destroying the property of the guardians, and obstructing the police in the execution of their duty. They were immediately afterwards handcuffed and forwarded in an omnibus to Ipswich. On their passage through the streets of the town, they shouted most lustily, and seemed exceedingly merry.|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) are a {{new form}} of industrially relevant nano-scale particle and are seen as the cutting edge of the burgeoning nanotechnology revolution which promises to impact on all our lives. Due to high length to diameter ratio, CNT are perhaps the most well known of a growing collection of high aspect ratio nanoparticles (HARN). However the production and use of carbon nanotubes has presented an interesting toxicological question based on its structure and raised the question ‘are carbon nanotubes like asbestos?’. Few people are unaware of the devastating global pandemic of diseases caused by asbestos and similarities in needle-like shape between asbestos and nanotubes have raised fears that nanotubes may mimic asbestos-type disease. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate this link, based on the wealth of information known about the toxic effects of certain forms of fibre on the respiratory system. From this we hope to identify those carbon nanotubes which are hazardous whilst not prejudicing the use of those industrially relevant materials which can be used safely. Within fibre toxicology there exists a central paradigm which outlines the main properties a fibrous particle must possess if it is to exert pathogenic effects in the body. This paradigm outlines the importance of length, thinness and biopersistence to a fibre and an absence of one or more of these attributes results in a loss of pathogenicity. We took this paradigm and, using suitable asbestos and non-asbestos controls, applied it various morphological forms of carbon nanotubes using an in vivo model. The resultant data demonstrates for the first time that asbestos-like pathogenic behaviour associated with carbon nanotubes is closely linked to the morphology of the nanotubes and their aggregates. Specifically our results showed that CNT which possessed a long, straight length were highly inflammogenic and fibrogenic within the peritoneal cavity of mice; a model sensitive to the pathogenic effects of fibres. As well as length, the importance of biopersistence in the pathogenesis of fibrous particles has been known for many years and is a central attribute affecting the pathogenicity of fibres. Amphibole asbestos is known to be durable, a commercially exploited attribute and as such is biopersistent in the lung which is a key feature of its pathogenicity. Glass fibre on the other hand is bio-soluble, and whilst long and inhalable, does not cause significant disease due to its lack of biopersistence. Based on the grapheme structure of CNT which impart exceptional strength and rigidity and the chemical inertness of carbon we would hypothesis that CNT would be biopersistent and therefore fulfil another of the criteria of the fibre pathogenicity paradigm (FPP). Our aim therefore has been to establish the durability of CNT against fibrous particles of known durability using a synthetic solution maintained at a pH to simulate the lung environment. Using a range of 4 CNT and using both durable and non-durable fibres such as amphibole asbestos and <b>glass</b> fibre to <b>bench</b> mark our result; we demonstrated that 3 of the 4 CNT tested displayed exceptional durability whilst the fourth lost approximately 30 % of its mass during the experiment with concomitant reduction in pathogenicity. As well as length and biopersistence, the surface of a particle has been shown to contribute to the overall toxicity of a particle and in certain circumstances, such as that of quartz, the surface of the particle can be the biologically active component. In the case of carbon nanotubes, surface functionalisation is commonly used for various endpoints including the addition of various tags and labels for tracking. As such our further aim was to investigate the relationship between the length-dependent pathogenicity of a fibre sample and the surface of the fibre. By using different forms of functional groups attached to the surface of a pathogenic carbon nanotube we aim to critically test if the level of inflammation and fibrosis triggered in vivo can be altered by simple alteration of the surface. Our results showed that surface modification of CNT could alter the inflammogenic and fibrogenic effects of CNT which may have important implications when considering the hazard assessment of functionalised HARN. As CNT are not the only form of fibrous nanomaterial and within this project we also attempted to determine the applicability of the FPP to further high aspect ratio nanomaterials. In order to do this we set out to determine the generality of this hypothesis by asking whether nickel nanowires, a radically different form of HARN to CNT, show length-dependent pathogenicity. Nickel oxide nanowires synthesised to be predominantly long (> 20 μm) act similarly to amphibole asbestos in showing the ability to elicit strong inflammation in the mouse peritoneal model in a dose dependent manner; inflammation was not seen with the short (< 5 μm) nanowires. In summation, the results from this study are the first to show that long HARN can indeed behave like asbestos when in contact with the sensitive mesothelium. This study suggests a potential link between inhalation exposure to long nanotubes and asbestos-related disease, especially mesothelioma and as such this may have immediate implications across many disciplines if care is to be taken to avoid a long term legacy of harm.
