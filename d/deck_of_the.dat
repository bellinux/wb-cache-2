5|$|In 1957 a Filton-based RAF Vampire jet from 501 Squadron {{crashed into}} Leigh Woods. The pilot, Flying officer John Greenwood, was killed after he flew under the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{suspension}} bridge while performing a victory roll.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{original}} 1970s-era stations, especially the aerial stations, feature simple Brutalist architecture, but newer stations are a mix of Neomodern and Postmodern architecture. The additional double tracked four mile long upper <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Market Street Subway and its four underground stations were built by BART for the S.F. Municipal Railway.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>decks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{approaches}} {{were taking}} shape as well. Construction <b>of</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roadway actually occurred over <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old cantilever bridges, which remained open to traffic without interruption.|$|R
5|$|On 4 June 1927, a {{crowd of}} 7,000 well-wishers saw City of Honolulu depart on her maiden voyage. The festivities were also {{broadcast}} on radio station KGFO, a portable station operating form the front cargo <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship. During the journey, broadcasts of the City of Honolulus orchestra, along with radio personalities and musicians from Los Angeles station KHJ, entertained both passengers and listeners on shore (while the ship was in range).|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the crew lived on the single gun <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Warrior; these crewmen slept in hammocks slung from the sides and deck beams, with up to 18 men between each pair of guns. The officers berthed {{in the rear of}} the ship in small individual cabins; the wardroom was also the officers' mess. The captain had two spacious, well-furnished cabins.|$|E
5|$|After regaining the title, Yokozuna {{challenged}} any American {{athlete to}} bodyslam {{him on the}} <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USS Intrepid on July 4, 1993. After many challengers failed, Lex Luger arrived by helicopter and bodyslammed Yokozuna. Luger became a fan favorite and changed his gimmick to an American patriot. He faced Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1993; he won the match by countout but did not win the title. Lex Luger and Bret Hart each earned a title match against Yokozuna the following year at WrestleMania X. Luger was disqualified in his match, but Hart won the championship later that night.|$|E
50|$|A {{lifeboat}} was dispatched {{from the}} Charlesville shortly after daybreak to rescue Captain Zarbis, who was spotted pacing <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> still-burning ship. Zarbis {{was the last}} person to leave the Lakonia alive.|$|R
25|$|There {{was little}} outside deck space for passengers. The {{existing}} ferries had large decks, {{and it was}} common for passengers to spend the entire sailing circling <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship or sunbathing on the lifejacket containers.|$|R
50|$|Diagonal box beams {{have been}} added to each bay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper and lower <b>decks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western spans. These add {{stiffness}} to reduce side-to-side motion during an earthquake and reduce <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> damage to <b>the</b> <b>decking</b> surfaces.|$|R
5|$|At 2pm on Wednesday, March 21, the Spray {{collided}} with the Lucinda four miles north of Barnegat, New Jersey, knocking {{a hole in the}} Sprays bow that resulted in her filling with water; the Lucinda also sustained damage. Capt. Willis of the Lucinda saw no one other than Jackalow (whom he blamed for the collision) on board the Spray, and Jackalow refused to be rescued and taken aboard the Lucinda. Willis observed that the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spray was strewn with bedding and other articles from the cabin.|$|E
5|$|Bouchard {{was one of}} nine {{players and}} one builder elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1966.

Bouchard along with Elmer Lach, the two oldest surviving members, were on hand to drop the ceremonial puck at centre ice.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Manahawkin Bay Bridge was {{dedicated}} the Dorland J. Henderson Memorial Bridge {{in honor of}} Dorland J. Henderson, {{who was one of}} NJDOT’s top engineers that designed the lighting system for the Manahawkin Bay Bridge. In September 2009, the NJDOT began repairs to the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Manahawkin Bay Bridge. This project, completed in May 2010, cost $4 million and received funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Manahawkin Bay Bridge is to undergo a rehabilitation project and a parallel bridge will be built to the south. Construction began on May 3, 2013 with completion expected in 2019.|$|E

25|$|On 24 June 1866 {{there was}} a serious fire in a corn mill close to the line on the Newcastle shore. The fire grew and became a total conflagration, and <b>the</b> timber <b>decking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Level Bridge caught fire. It {{appeared}} this might engulf the entire bridge.|$|R
5|$|Lex Luger's {{rivalry with}} Yokozuna began on July 4 at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge on the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USS Intrepid. After several wrestlers and other athletes {{attempted}} to body slam Yokozuna, Luger {{arrived in a}} helicopter. He was able to body slam Yokozuna, {{which led to a}} title shot at SummerSlam. To build support for Luger, the WWF had him ride across the country in a bus named the Lex Express. Yokozuna's spokesperson, Jim Cornette, agreed to the match, but he made Lex Luger agree to two conditions. Luger would not receive a rematch if he lost, and he had to wear protective padding over the steel plate in his forearm.|$|E
5|$|Orizaba made15 transatlantic voyages for the Navy {{carrying}} {{troops to}} and from Europe in World War I with the second-shortest average in-port turnaround time of all Navy transports. The ship {{was turned over to}} the War Department in 1919for use as Army transport USAT Orizaba. After her World War I service ended, Orizaba reverted to the Ward Line, her previous owners. The ship was briefly engaged in transatlantic service to Spain and then engaged in New York–Cuba–Mexico service until 1939, when the ship was chartered to United States Lines. While Orizaba was in her Ward Line service, American poet Hart Crane leapt to his death from the rear <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liner off Florida in April 1932.|$|E
5|$|Owing to a {{computer}} malfunction, the remaining soldier awakens with amnesia in a cryo-tube on the medical <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Von Braun, being implanted with an illegal cyber-neural interface. He is immediately contacted by another survivor, Dr. Janice Polito, who guides him to safety before the cabin depressurizes. She demands that he meets her on deck 4 of the Von Braun. Along the way, the soldier battles the infected crew members. The Many also telepathically communicate with him, attempting to convince him to join them. After restarting the ship's engine core, the soldier reaches deck 4 and discovers that Polito is dead. He is then confronted by SHODAN. It is revealed she has been posing as Polito to gain the soldier's trust.|$|E
40|$|Newell & Shanks (N&S) {{conclude}} that healthy participants learn {{to differentiate between}} the good and bad <b>decks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iowa Gambling Task, and that healthy participants even have conscious knowledge about the task's payoff structure. Improved methods of analysis and new behavioral findings suggest that this conclusion is premature...|$|R
500|$|On 22 July, <b>the</b> ships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Fleet {{received}} {{a visit from}} King George V. After inspecting the Fleet from <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destroyer , the king presided over an investiture ceremony on board Admiral Beatty's flagship [...] King George presented numerous decorations, but the first recipient was Admiral Rodman himself. Invested as a Knight Commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bath, Rodman received the highest honor awarded that day.|$|R
50|$|By 2015, Monroe County began {{planning}} {{a series of}} improvements designed at improving <b>the</b> functionality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terminal building, and it's parking facilities. In April 2016, the airport closed the departures-level roadway, so it could repair <b>the</b> concrete road <b>decking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure. This was completed in early July 2016.|$|R
5|$|Some of the Bay Area Rapid Transit System's current {{coverage}} area was once served by an electrified streetcar and suburban train system called the Key System. This early 20th-century system once had regular transbay traffic across the lower <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bay Bridge, {{but the system}} was dismantled in the 1950s and operated its last transbay crossing in 1958. By the mid-1950s, that system had been dismantled in favor of highway travel. A 1950s study of traffic problems in the Bay Area concluded the most cost-effective solution for the Bay Area's traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a new, high-speed rapid transit system linking the cities and suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{bridge was}} formed by pre-casting {{individual}} concrete units on the southern river shore, then hoisting them into place on temporary timber staging in the river. The units were then structurally joined by strands of high-tensile wire and stretched with a hydraulic jack. These pre-stressing strands were anchored in reinforced concrete blocks {{at the ends of}} the spans. The new bridge had a traffic capacity of 6,000 cars per hour in each direction, over a total of six traffic lanes.|$|E
5|$|When Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to {{organize}} the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar {{for the first time}} in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C. where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.|$|E

25|$|At noon {{all four}} ships {{exchanged}} broadsides and musket volleys {{in a battle}} that lasted for nearly a whole day. The English ships tried to board the Cinco Chagas but were repelled by the larger Portuguese numbers.

50|$|Boot competed at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin in the men's 800 metres, {{finishing}} last in his semi-final. Like his teammate, Cecil Matthews, {{he suffered}} tendon problems from running on <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wanganella {{en route to}} the games, and was below his best form. He withdrew from <b>the</b> fourth heat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1500 metres.|$|R
5|$|After {{about half}} of his army had been ferried into Indiana, the Union gunboat USS Elk and an armed private ship, the Grey Eagle, arrived on the scene. The Elk fired a shot into the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alice Dean as it tried to escape to the shoreline. Both of the Union ships were wooden, and as the Confederate {{artillery}} opened fire, they quickly retreated upriver towards Louisville to avoid being destroyed. The crossing resumed again. In total, it took seventeen hours for Morgan to ferry his now 2,000 men and supplies across the river. By listening in on the telegraph, he learned that Brig. Gen. Edward H. Hobson with a force of 4,000 cavalry was advancing on his position from the south. The lead elements of the Union force arrived in Brandenburg at about 8:00 pm, where the Confederate rearguard was able to delay their advance long enough for Morgan's artillery to be carried across the river. On the last trip across, most of the rearguard was able to escape, but several were left behind and captured.|$|E
5|$|At {{almost the}} same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm, her fore-topsail halyard was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she 'luffed up'. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was 'in irons', her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made {{sternway}} (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British ship. Mr Stevens, Broke's boatswain, lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E
5|$|David prepares Weyland for an {{excursion}} to the Engineer ship. Shaw asks David {{about his}} freedom after Weyland's eventual demise, {{to which he}} ominously asks about every child's dream of having their parents dead. He leads the team to the flight <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship, where he awakens and speaks with the Engineer, who reacts by decapitating him and killing {{the rest of the}} team, save for Shaw. David's severed head watches from the floor as the Engineer launches the ship and attempts to embark for Earth. After the ship is disabled by Prometheus getting purposefully crashed into it, David warns Shaw that the Engineer is coming for her. David contacts Shaw after she escapes the Engineer and convinces her to retrieve his head and body, so that he may pilot another ship. Shaw dictates that she will cooperate with him if he takes them to the Engineer home world, which he agrees to, despite not understanding her motivations. Together, they depart from the moon aboard an Engineer ship.|$|E
