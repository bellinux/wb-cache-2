Elvis has emerged as a <b>great</b> <b>artist,</b> a great rocker, a great purveyor of schlock, a great heart throb, a great bore, a great symbol of potency, a great ham, a great nice person, and, yes, a great American.|$|E

25|$|To Antonino Votto, Callas wasThe last <b>great</b> <b>artist.</b> When {{you think}} this woman was nearly blind, and often sang {{standing}} a good 150 feet from the podium.

She {{was not just a}} singer, but a complete artist. It's foolish to discuss her as a voice. She must be viewed totally—as a complex of music, drama, movement. There is no one like her today. She was an esthetic phenomenon.|$|E

It is that continuing influence, embodied in the magnificent series of films he has given the world, during the last half-century, that will preserve his great spirit, his humour and his wit, not only for us but for succeeding generations of film-goers.|$|E

25|$|Ernő Zórád {{ended his}} {{professional}} relationship with Tibor Cs. Horváth and wrote his own comic scripts. Luckily Zórád {{was not just}} a <b>great</b> <b>artist,</b> but also a talented storyteller: these comics came much closer to the medium's own language. He also made experimental collage comics in the early seventies attracting international attention. These works were invited to the Salone Internazionale del Comics festival in 1970 but his portfolio – due to Hungarian bureaucracy – has arrived late. Furthermore, the works has been stolen from the festival. By the late seventies the classic trio of Hungarian comics creators disappeared: Korcsmáros died in 1975, Sebők died in 1980 and Zórád retired temporarily. Since young talents were not introduced during the preceding three decades (except for Attila Fazekas), many mark these years the end of Hungarian comics' golden age.|$|E

I am 50 now but 25 years ago I was living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which {{at that time was}} suffering from a long drought and famine. It was a terrible situation. Lots of people became sick and many more died. Around one million people in all were killed by the famine. In 1984 Michael Jackson, along with a number of other leading musicians, made the song We are the World to raise money for Africa. We received a lot of aid from the world and I {{was one of those who}} directly benefitted from it. The wheat flour that was distributed to the famine victims was different to the usual cereal we bought at the market. We baked a special bread from it. The local people named the bread after the <b>great</b> <b>artist</b> and it became known as Michael Bread. It was soft and delicious.|$|E

And here we are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where are they now? They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's a <b>great</b> <b>artist</b> in his own right. But where you're going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage." ...|$|E

500|$|When President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva {{took office}} in January 2003, he chose Gil as Brazil's new Minister of Culture, only the second black person {{to serve in the}} country's cabinet. The {{appointment}} was controversial among political and artistic figures and the Brazilian press; a remark Gil made about difficulties with his salary received particular criticism. Gil is not a member of Lula's Workers' Party and did not participate in creating its cultural program. Shortly after becoming Minister, Gil began a partnership between Brazil and Creative Commons. As Minister, he has sponsored a program called Culture Points, which gives grants to provide music technology and education to people living in poor areas of the country's cities. Gil has since asserted that [...] "You've now got young people who are becoming designers, who are making it into media and being used more and more by television and samba schools and revitalizing degraded neighborhoods. It's a different vision of the role of government, a new role." [...] Gil has also expressed interest in a program that will establish an Internet repository of freely downloadable Brazilian music. Since Gil's appointment, the department's expenditures have increased by over 50percent. In November 2007 Gil announced his intention to resign from his post due to a vocal cord polyp. Lula rejected Gil's first two attempts to resign, but accepted another request in July 2008. Lula said on this occasion that Gil was [...] "going back to being a <b>great</b> <b>artist,</b> going back to giving priority to what is most important" [...] to him.|$|E
