5|$|By 1961, {{when all}} {{airframe}} maintenance at Laverton {{was transferred to}} Nos.2 and 3 Aircraft Depots, No.1 AD had serviced forty-two aircraft types throughout its existence. It continued to maintain aero engines, and began supporting telecommunications equipment as well. The aircraft engine repair facilities at No.1 AD were closed down in 1968. Staff were transferred to No.3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, {{to prepare for the}} introduction of the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber to Australian service and concentrate on maintaining the new aircraft's engines. No.1 AD's focus thereafter shifted to ground support, manufacturing, installing, servicing and providing training for navigational, air traffic control, telecommunications and motor transport equipment used by the Air Force and other sections of Defence and government. From 1968 to 1977, the depot was organised into two components, Telecommunications Installation and Maintenance Squadron and Ground <b>Equipment</b> <b>Maintenance</b> Squadron. These were subdivided in February 1977 into Telecommunications Squadron (maintaining ground communications equipment for control towers, transmitters and receiving stations in Australia and the region), Radar Squadron (supporting surveillance systems at RAAF Bases Williamtown, Amberley, Townsville, Darwin and Pearce), Ground <b>Equipment</b> <b>Maintenance</b> Squadron (maintaining motor transport, and other ground-based mechanical and electro-mechanical systems), and Intermediate Level Maintenance Squadron (communications, navigation and other ground-based maintenance at Laverton, as well as spectrometric analysis of oil used by the RAAF in aircraft and other equipment).|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} factor that negatively affects maintenance is the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft and sale of spare parts and even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries. When not stealing spare parts and <b>equipment,</b> <b>maintenance</b> personnel often spend {{the better part of}} their duty day looking for other ways to profit. American maintenance teams working in Zaire found that providing a free lunch to the work force was a good, sometimes the only, technique to motivate personnel to work {{at least half of the}} duty day.|$|E

5|$|Henry Edward Roberts studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Miami before enlisting in the U.S. Air Force in 1962. He {{soon became}} an {{electronics}} {{instructor at the}} Cryptographic <b>Equipment</b> <b>Maintenance</b> School at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. To augment his meager enlisted man's pay, Roberts worked on several off-duty projects and even set up a one-man company, Reliance Engineering. The most notable job was to create the electronics that animated the Christmas characters in the window display of Joske's department store in San Antonio. In 1965, he was selected for an Air Force program to complete his college degree, and became a commissioned officer. Roberts earned an Electrical Engineering degree from Oklahoma State University in 1968 and {{was assigned to the}} Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|No.81 Wing re-formed at Williamtown on 2February 1987. Along with No.75 Squadron at Tindal, its flying units {{consisted}} of Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons based at Williamtown with No.2 OCU, {{all of which}} had converted from the Mirage to the Hornet between 1985 and 1987, the last-mentioned being the prime operator of the two-seat F/A-18B trainers. Having continued to perform fighter maintenance through the 1960s and '70s, No.481 Squadron disbanded on 31January 1987. It re-formed the next day as No.481 Wing under No.81 Wing's parent organisation, Tactical Fighter Group (TFG), and {{consisted of}} two squadrons, Aircraft Maintenance Squadron Williamtown (AMSWLM) and Aircraft <b>Equipment</b> <b>Maintenance</b> Squadron Williamtown (AEMSWLM). By 1996, No.81 Wing had been augmented by Nos.25 and 76 Squadrons, operating Macchi MB-326 lead-in fighters, the former based at RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, and the latter at Williamtown, where it also employed Pilatus PC-9s for forward air control (FAC). On 1July 1996, No.481 Wing was reorganised as No.402 Wing, incorporating a newly re-formed No.481 Squadron as well as Weapon Systems Support Flight and Field Training Flight. No.402 Wing transferred its functions to No.81 Wing's flying squadrons on 31July 1998 before disbanding in October. The same year, No.25 Squadron was split, its Macchis now being operated by a re-formed No.79 Squadron. No.78 Wing was re-established in 2000 as an operational training formation, taking over Nos.76 and 79 Squadrons, and No.2 OCU. By 2007, No.2 OCU {{had returned to the}} control of No.81 Wing.|$|E

The Environmental Protection Agency classifies StationB as a superfund site due to the presence of an inactive landfill and two chemical pits that have released trichloroethylene into nearby residential drinking water wells.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010, the TPA {{announced}} that it would spend $8 million CAD on upgrades to the airport.

The expense would be recouped from the Airport Improvement Fee charged to passengers. In February 2010, Air Canada filed suit against the TPA to get access to the airport, access it had lost when Porter had evicted Jazz in 2006. On March 29, 2010, the Federal Court ruled that Air Canada would have a hearing in July 2010 of its objections to the TPA process. On March 7, 2010, {{the first half of the}} Porter's new terminal opened. The new terminal, estimated to cost $50 million CAD, was completed in early 2011.

500|$|Finland {{participates in}} nearly all sub-areas of the Partnership for Peace programme, and has {{provided}} peacekeeping forces to both the Afghanistan and Kosovo missions. The possibility of Finland's membership in NATO {{was one of the}} most important issues debated in relation to the Finnish presidential election of 2006, and continues to be a significant issue in Finnish politics. In 2007, Finland made various technical preparations for membership, with the then Defence Minister Jyri Häkämies eager to pursue NATO membership.

In April 2014, the government announced that they would sign a [...] "Memorandum of Understanding" [...] with NATO on Finland's readiness to receive military assistance and to aid NATO in <b>equipment</b> <b>maintenance.</b> However, Defence Minister Carl Haglund emphasized that this memorandum would not be a step towards membership.|$|E
500|$|Members of the United States {{armed forces}} are exposed to CS during initial {{training}}, and during training refresher courses or <b>equipment</b> <b>maintenance</b> exercises, using CS tablets that are melted on a hotplate. This is to demonstrate the importance of properly wearing a gas or protective mask, as the agent's presence quickly reveals an improper fit or seal of the mask's rubber gaskets against the face. Following exposure while wearing a mask, recruits are ordered to remove the masks and endure exposure in the room. These exercises also encourage confidence {{in the ability of}} the equipment to protect the wearer from such chemical attacks. Such an event is a requirement for graduation from United States Army Basic Training, Air Force Basic Military Training, Navy Basic Training, and Marine Corps recruit training. CS gas in the form of grenades is also used extensively in the United States Marine Corps and United States Army in some service schools. CS gas is used during the final field exercise of the Scout Sniper Basic Course to simulate being compromised. In addition, it is used during the [...] escape-and-evasion exercise ("Trail of Tears"), the last event before graduation from the course. It is also used during several events in the Marine Corps Basic Reconnaissance Course (BRC) including some rucksack runs and escape-and-evasion exercises. While students going through the course are given the opportunity to bring and wear a gas mask for the event, usually none are worn because once donned, gas masks could not be removed {{until the end of the}} exercise. This could last anywhere from 3–12 hours and would make running 25km while wearing [...] of gear virtually impossible.|$|E
