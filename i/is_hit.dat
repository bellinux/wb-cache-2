5|$|Five months later, Wendy is on {{a subway}} train with her roommate Laura {{and her friend}} Sean. When she sees more omens she begins to get off, but sees Julie {{entering}} the car and decides to stay. Wendy notices Kevin {{sitting in the back}} of the car. The train derails, and everyone aboard shortly dies; Julie <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> by a stray wheel, and Kevin is crushed between the train and the tunnel wall. Wendy survives the crash, but <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> by another train. This turns out to be another premonition, and they attempt to stop the train. The screen goes black, followed by the sound of screeching metal.|$|E
5|$|Frequently, the Earth's {{magnetosphere}} <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> by solar flares causing geomagnetic storms, provoking {{displays of}} aurorae. The short-term instability {{of the magnetic}} field is measured with the K-index.|$|E
5|$|Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) lies unconscious, {{having been}} thrown from her car after it plunged over a ravine. Steph Sims (Tonicha Lawrence) watches {{down from the}} top of the cliff before driving off. A few minutes later she calls for an ambulance, but <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> by a car before she can. As Connie regains consciousness, she notices Grace Beauchamp's (Emily Carey) shoe in the car. Flames begin erupting from the vehicle. Connie moves towards the car but before she can get to Grace it explodes.|$|E
50|$|Thus tennis shots can be {{categorized}} according to when they <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> (serve, groundstroke, volley, half volley), how they <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> (smash, forehand, backhand, flat, side spin, block, slice, topspin shot), or where they <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> (lob, passing shot, dropshot, cross-court shot, down-the-line shot).|$|R
6000|$|Strether, on his side, did {{justice to}} that plea. [...] "Oh of course I saw she <b>was</b> <b>hit.</b> That she <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>was</b> {{what we were}} busy with; that she <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>was</b> our great affair. But somehow I couldn't {{think of her as}} down in the dust. And as put there by OUR little Chad!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... in snooker terms) [...] - [...] {{striking}} one's {{cue ball}} {{so that it}} hits another ball and then enters a pocket: 3 points if the red ball <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> first; 2 points if the other cue ball <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> first; 2 points if the red and the other cue ball <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> simultaneously.|$|R
5|$|Davis, Hill, and Mitchell {{find him}} {{rumbling}} {{around in the}} power plant. Davis tries to kill him, but Steiner resists his bullets, so Hill again tries to persuade Steiner {{to return to the}} laboratory. Steiner is eventually convinced, so he goes with them, but when he arrives, he tricks them and begins destroying things. With the laboratory on fire and the projection device wildly out of control, Steiner <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> by the projection device's laser, causing him to disappear as the fire rages on.|$|E
5|$|Homer bites into a solid-gold giraffe, {{which is}} the winning contest piece {{for a trip to}} Africa. The animal cracker company {{initially}} refuses to honor the prize because the contest ended a number of years ago. But when Homer <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> in the eye by a sharp corner of the box, the company gives the Simpsons their Africa trip in order to avoid a lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} games, Sonic collects golden rings, which {{protect him}} from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, though they will scatter and blink before disappearing. Sonic starts {{the game with a}} limited number of lives; if he <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> with no rings in his possession, he will lose a life. If a player exhausts their lives, they will receive a game over.|$|E
5000|$|One-handed backhands should <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> more {{in front}} of the body than the forehand, which allows them to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> with a deeper hit spot.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{baseball}} <b>was</b> <b>hit,</b> it <b>was</b> considered property of MLB and after it <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>was</b> considered intentionally abandoned property. Under this theory, whoever comes into possession of it {{first is the}} rightful owner.|$|R
50|$|The fiery Jennings {{was also}} {{known as one of}} the most fearless players of his time, {{allowing}} himself to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> by pitches more than any other player. In one game, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by a pitch three times. In 1896, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by pitches 51 times—a Major League record that still stands. In just five seasons with the Orioles from 1894 to 1898, Jennings <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by pitches an unprecedented 202 times. During one game, Jennings <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> in the head by a pitch from Amos Rusie in the 3rd inning, but managed to finish the game. As soon as the game ended, Jennings collapsed and was unconscious for three days.|$|R
5|$|On Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) and Peggy Mitchell's (Barbara Windsor) wedding day, {{the true}} {{identity}} of Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace) as Ronnie Mitchell's (Samantha Womack) daughter is revealed. Archie has told Ronnie that her daughter, whom {{he gave up}} for adoption as a baby, has died. Just after Ronnie realises the truth, Danielle <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> by a car and dies.|$|E
5|$|Pendragon's only form of defence in {{the game}} {{is his ability to}} utilise various magical spells, in which the correct spell is {{required}} in order to defeat certain enemies. If the player <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> by an attack of any enemy in the castle, Pendragon will lose energy, or in some cases, time will be deducted from the countdown timer. If the player completely runs out of energy or fails to destroy the Staff of Karnath before midnight, the game will end.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} {{as part of}} his promise to Bhuvan, Lakha takes a diving one-handed catch. However, the British score almost 300 runs, losing only three wickets by the lunch break. Kachra is brought back to bowl and, bowling with a now-worn ball, takes a hat-trick, which sparks the {{collapse}} of the British batting side. The villagers soon start their innings. Bhuvan and Deva (a Sikh, who has played cricket earlier when he was a British sepoy) give their team a solid start. Deva misses out on his half-century when a straight-drive from Bhuvan ricochets off the bowler's hand onto the stumps at the non-striker's end, where Deva is backing up too far. When Lakha comes on to bat, he <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> on the head by a bouncer and falls onto his stumps. Other batsmen get out rashly trying to score a boundary off each delivery. Ismail (Raj Zutshi), a good batsman, retires hurt as he <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> on the leg. The villagers' team ends the day with four batsmen out of action with barely a third of the required runs on board.|$|E
5000|$|Housemates can <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> (figuratively) with a {{poisonous}} arrow. Big Brother will {{decide to do}} something to the housemate who <b>was</b> <b>hit.</b> For instance, in the Week 1, Ema <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> with {{a poisonous}} arrow by Duško (who was evicted from the main house to the Dumps). Big Brother then decided to take away all the personal stuff from Ema. In Week 2, Bojana <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by an arrow (which was shot by Soraja) and had to do all of the house chores by herself.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the four}} bodyguards {{in the rear}} Fiat car, two were {{slightly}} injured while the other two <b>were</b> severely <b>hit</b> by shrapnel: Anthony Ruggiero <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> in the eye, while Salvatore La Porta <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> {{in the head and}} other parts of his body.|$|R
50|$|Being lovestruck means having {{mental and}} {{physical}} symptoms associated with falling in love: 'Love-struck...means to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> by love...you <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> in your heart by the emotion of love'.|$|R
5|$|The nuclear {{properties}} of plutonium-239 were also studied; {{researchers found that}} when it <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> by a neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction. This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass.|$|E
5|$|While he {{is leaving}} court, Uncle Junior <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> {{in the head}} with a boom mic and falls down several steps. Tony advises him to take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, act mentally incompetent, and employ it as a ruse for not continuing the trial. Later, Eugene Pontecorvo intimidates a juror, resulting in a deadlocked jury, forcing the judge to declare a mistrial.|$|E
5|$|A double {{is a safe}} hit {{in which}} the batter reaches second base without being called out. This {{scenario}} often occurs when a ball <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> into the gaps between the outfielders, or down the foul line {{on either side of}} the playing field. Tris Speaker is the all-time leader in doubles in MLB history, with 792, one of which was part of a cycle; Speaker accomplished the feat for the Boston Red Sox on June 9, 1912, against the St. Louis Browns. Two of the other top five players in MLB history in doubles have hit for the cycle: Stan Musial (725 doubles; third all-time) completed the cycle on July 24, 1949; and Craig Biggio (668; fifth all-time) accomplished the feat on April 8, 2002. The single-season MLB leader is Earl Webb, the left-handed outfielder who hit 67 in 1931.|$|E
5000|$|... 1225: Bailey {{launched}} five torpedoes at 9500 yd. All missed. Bailey <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> twice by 8-inch {{shells and}} came to a stop with five dead. Coghlan <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> once.|$|R
5000|$|On April 27, 2017, Hample caught {{two home}} runs during the same game at Progressive Field. One <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> off the bat of Marwin González and another <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by Abraham Almonte.|$|R
50|$|Brady Anderson was {{the first}} player to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> by a pitch two times in the same inning in an American League game. On April 25, 2014, Brandon Moss became the second when he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> twice {{in the top of the}} 9th inning by Houston Astros pitchers. Five players have <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by a pitch twice in the same inning in the National League.|$|R
5|$|Annually, Manila <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> with 5 to 7 typhoons {{creating}} floods. In 2009, Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) {{struck the}} Philippines. In its aftermath, {{the lack of}} infrastructure led {{to one of the}} worst floodings in the Philippines and creating a significant amount of pollution. Following the aftermath of Typhoon Ketsana, the city began to dredge its rivers and improve its drainage network. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission is in charge of cleaning up the Pasig River and tributaries for transportation, recreation and tourism purposes. Rehabilitation efforts have resulted in the creation of parks along the riverside, along with stricter pollution controls.|$|E
5|$|At school, Cartman begins farting fire, and Kyle unsuccessfully {{tries to}} {{convince}} his teacher, Mr. Garrison, to excuse him from class to find his brother. When Chef learns that Kyle's brother was abducted and sees a machine emerge from Cartman's anus, he helps the boys escape from school by pulling the fire alarm. Once outside, Cartman reiterates that his abduction was only a dream, when suddenly he <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> by a beam, causing him to begin singing and dancing to I Love to Singa. Soon afterward, a spaceship appears. Kyle throws a stone and the spaceship fires back, propelling Kenny into the road. As he gets back up, he is trampled over by a herd of cows, but survives. A police car then runs Kenny over and kills him.|$|E
5|$|By {{examining}} unique striations, or markings, {{left behind}} on the bullet as it passes through the barrel and on the cartridge as it <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> by the firing pin, individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a comparison microscope. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings {{can be compared to}} other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as expert witnesses.|$|E
50|$|Tehran sits on {{two major}} fault lines, {{and it has}} <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by over 1000 big and small {{earthquake}}s; although, the region has not <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by a severe earthquake in the last 150 years.|$|R
50|$|In 1899 Sarie <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by a bullet. She <b>was</b> not <b>hit</b> by the English soldiers, but by others.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by two {{bombs and}} two torpedoes. The crew might have kept her afloat, but {{were ordered to}} abandon ship {{just as they were}} raising power for the pumps. Burning oil from Arizona and [...] drifted down on her, and {{probably}} made the situation look worse than it was. The disarmed target ship [...] was holed twice by torpedoes. West Virginia <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by seven torpedoes, the seventh tearing away her rudder. [...] <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by four torpedoes, the last two above her belt armor, which caused her to capsize. [...] <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by two of the converted 16" [...] shells, but neither caused serious damage.|$|R
5|$|Cheetahs {{engage in}} several {{displays}} during fights, hunting, or self-defence. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah {{will hold its}} head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.|$|E
5|$|Costello {{picks up}} the trenchcoat and shoots more {{subordinates}} who get in his way. Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> and Costello demands that he put the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with the woman and children.|$|E
5|$|Crash Bandicoot is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control the titular protagonist, Crash, as he traverses several levels in sequence in order to progress. Crash is able to defeat enemies by either jumping on them or using a spinning attack that launches them. Crash will lose a life if he <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> by an enemy or obstacle, or falls into a bottomless pit. Crash can protect himself by collecting Aku Aku masks, which protect Crash from a single hit from an enemy or obstacle (but not pits or other instant-death obstacles). Crash can hold onto two masks at a time and, upon collecting a third mask, will gain temporary invincibility. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, with more lives earned by finding extra life items or by collecting 100 Wumpa Fruit.|$|E
