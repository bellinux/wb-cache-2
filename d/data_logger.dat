5000|$|<b>Data</b> <b>loggers</b> are implicitly {{stand-alone}} devices, while typical {{data acquisition}} system must remain tethered to a computer to acquire data. This stand-alone aspect of <b>data</b> <b>loggers</b> implies on-board memory {{that is used to}} store acquired data. Sometimes this memory is very large to accommodate many days, or even months, of unattended recording. This memory may be battery-backed static random access memory, flash memory or EEPROM.

40|$|December 13 - 14, 2006 Siam City Hotel, Bangkok, ThailandData loggers are {{emerging}} as {{a powerful tool for}} quantifying behavioral parameters of aquatic animals. However, {{in the history of the}} study about sea turtles, this approach has been applied only into gravid female turtles which land on the same beach several times within a nesting season because <b>data</b> <b>loggers</b> require physical recovery for data retrieval. Therefore, our knowledge of ecology on sea turtles in the neritic and oceanic environment is still rudimentary. We, in this study, developed an automatic time scheduled release system that allows the loggers to be located and retrieved using VHF radio and ultrasonic signals without recapturing sea turtles. The data logger-recovery experiment was conducted on sea turtles in the neritic environment of the Yaeyama Islands, Okinawa, Japan. We recovered four <b>data</b> <b>loggers</b> and two time scheduled operated release systems at the time we programmed without the <b>data</b> <b>loggers</b> falling out. We demonstrated a high collection rate of <b>data</b> <b>loggers</b> by the recovery system, which means there is viability for the use of various <b>data</b> <b>loggers</b> in the study of ecology of sea turtles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} {{challenge in}} designing a {{wireless sensor network}} is to maximise the network’s lifetime. In a hierarchical cluster-based network, a key design issue is the placement of cluster heads (<b>data</b> <b>loggers)</b> such that the total power consumed by the overall network is minimised. Another key design goal is the localisation of sensors. In this study, we consider the placement of beacons and <b>data</b> <b>loggers</b> in the Cosumnes River Preserve. We consider a hybrid network in which the wireless sensors are deployed randomly into an irregular terrain while the <b>data</b> <b>loggers</b> and beacons are placed in a planned manner to satisfy the following three objectives: • provide complete area coverage • load balance each cluster • minimise the total power consumption for collecting the data. We formulated an optimisation problem to determine the location of <b>data</b> <b>loggers</b> and beacons – which is solved using an Integer Linear Program (ILP) ...|$|R
