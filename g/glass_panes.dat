25|$|The {{problems}} of making metal-coated, glass mirrors {{was due to}} the difficulties in making glass that was very clear, as most ancient glass was tinted green with iron. This was overcome when people began mixing soda, limestone, potash, manganese, and fern ashes with the glass. There was also no way for the ancients to make flat panes of glass with uniform thicknesses. The earliest methods for producing <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> began in France, when people began blowing glass bubbles, and then spinning them rapidly to flatten them out into plates from which pieces could be cut. However, these pieces were still not uniform in thickness, so produced distorted images as well. A better method was to blow a cylinder of glass, cut off the ends, slice it down the center, and unroll it onto a flat hearth. This method produced the first mirror-quality <b>glass</b> <b>panes,</b> but it was very difficult and resulted in a lot of breakage. Even windows were primarily made of oiled paper or stained glass, until the mid-nineteenth century, due to the high cost of making clear, flat panes of glass.|$|E

25|$|The {{rectangular}} {{windows on}} the south, east, north wing of the east wall, the west wall, and all walls in the north wing are similar. They consist of two rectangular, facing guillotine sashed windows covered by heavy wooden shutters painted dark green and fixed with wrought iron H or H-L hinges. The shutters are not of colonial origin. The east façade had two window openings: a large rectangular one that is 9 feet wide and 8’ 2” high with 16 over 16 <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> and a circular window above it with an inner section in quarters and an outer section in eighths. The circular window, in particular, is of uncertain authenticity as it is claimed that until restorations in 1930 it contained not the present type of window but either plastered over stone and rubble or a millstone. All of the other windows have 12 over 12 <b>glass</b> <b>panes.</b> The single south window is 7’ 2” wide and 8 feet high white the north wing has two smaller windows on its east and west walls and another on its north face. The frames for all the windows are flat with painted wood. The wooden, bottom sill projects slightly from the frame. All have brick sills with ovolo cast bricks marking them.|$|E

25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1995-1996, a series of large storms {{exacerbated}} the ongoing deterioration of the wood structure. The 100-mph winds blew out 30,000 fogged white <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> in the conservatory, shattered the white glass dome, and weakened the structure. In addition, 15 percent of the plant collection was lost due to exposure to the cold, wintry air and flying glass. After covering the holes with tarp and plywood and bringing in heaters, the conservatory contemplated farming out hundreds of plants to other institutions while the building was repaired. Some specimens however were too big or too old to move. The most challenging plant was the 112-year-old Brazilian philodendron that inhabited the shattered dome. A greenhouse was built to house the philodendron and other plants during renovation and afterwards used for expansion and keeping more exotic plants.|$|E
25|$|An {{adhesive}} sealant (polyisobutylene) {{is applied}} to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either polysulfide or silicone sealant or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system.|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{performance}} of <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> under fire was studied in this paper. Heat transfer to glass and associated fracture were reviewed first. Glass temperature profiles on the <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> were then summarized into three stages based on heat transfer: The first stage is on rapid heating up, {{the second stage}} is on steady heating up and the third stage is on losing heat to a certain value. Partial differential equations were set up on predicting the glass temperature at each stage with appropriate boundary conditions. By proposing different glass temperature variations for those three stages, three sets of partial differential equations were set up and solved. These three equations were then applied to study the heat up of glass with experimental data reported in the literature. The derived solution agrees reasonably well with experiment.
