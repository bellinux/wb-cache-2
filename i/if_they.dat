5|$|A {{group of}} {{antibodies}} {{can be called}} monovalent (or specific) <b>if</b> <b>they</b> have affinity for the same epitope, or for the same antigen (but potentially different epitopes on the molecule), or for the same strain of microorganism (but potentially different antigens on or in it). In contrast, a group of antibodies can be called polyvalent (or unspecific) <b>if</b> <b>they</b> have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms. Intravenous immunoglobulin, if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies are monovalent for the same epitope.|$|E
5|$|Applications {{are often}} {{classified}} {{according to how}} often their subtasks need to synchronize or communicate with each other. An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism if its subtasks must communicate many times per second; it exhibits coarse-grained parallelism <b>if</b> <b>they</b> do not communicate many times per second, and it exhibits embarrassing parallelism <b>if</b> <b>they</b> rarely or never have to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the easiest to parallelize.|$|E

5|$|Between {{chapters}} in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view.

They contrast their lives to Telemachus' and wonder <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would have killed him as a child <b>if</b> <b>they</b> knew he would kill them as a young man. They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E

Some, including General Glozelle, agree to do so, and Aslan creates a portal for them and the four Pevensies. Susan kisses Caspian, knowing they will never meet again, as Aslan told her and Peter that they will never return to Narnia. The Pevensies return to England, leaving Caspian as King.|$|E

5|$|In August 1810, Tecumseh led 400 armed warriors {{down the}} Wabash River {{to meet with}} Harrison in Vincennes. As the warriors were dressed in war paint, their sudden {{appearance}} at first frightened the soldiers at Vincennes. The leaders of the group were escorted to Grouseland, where they met Harrison. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne Treaty was illegitimate. He argued that no one tribe could sell land without {{the approval of the}} other tribes; he asked Harrison to nullify it and warned that Americans should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Tecumseh informed Harrison that he had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty <b>if</b> <b>they</b> carried out its terms, and that his confederation of tribes was growing rapidly. Harrison said the Miami were the owners of the land and could sell it <b>if</b> <b>they</b> so chose. He rejected Tecumseh's claim that all the Indians formed one nation. He said each tribe could have separate relations with the United States <b>if</b> <b>they</b> chose to. Harrison argued that the Great Spirit would have made all the tribes speak one language <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were to be one nation.|$|E

5|$|Neither {{side had}} been beaten {{en route to the}} final, with Arsenal only conceding two goals in their 12 matches before the final, {{including}} a record ten successive matches without conceding.
