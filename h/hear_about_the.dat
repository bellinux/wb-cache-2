5|$|One {{group of}} Corregidor prisoners, before first {{entering}} the camp, had each hidden {{a piece of}} a radio under their clothing, to later be reassembled into a working device. When the Japanese had an American radio technician fix their radios, he stole parts. The prisoners thus had several radios to listen to newscasts on radio stations as far away as San Francisco, allowing the POWs to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> status of the war. A smuggled camera was used to document the camp's living conditions. Prisoners also constructed weapons and smuggled ammunition into the camp for the possibility of securing a handgun.|$|E

25|$|In July 1810, {{shortly before}} {{completion}} of the lines, Fletcher left the fortifications to serve alongside Wellington once more in the field, and was thus at the Battle of Buçaco (27 September 1810) where he again distinguished himself and was mentioned in dispatches. Wellington fell back to the Lines of Torres Vedras in October 1810, pursued by Marshal Masséna, who was shocked to find such extensive defences, having been promised by Portuguese rebels that the road to Lisbon was an easy one. Wellington's superiors were equally surprised to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> defences when they later received his report. After an unsuccessful attack on 18 October, Masséna initially retreated to Santarém but when his supplies ran out the following March, he abandoned any thoughts of another attempt and headed north.|$|E

Foot soldiers received 520 pieces each, horse riders the double amount, captains 2080 pieces, generals 3640 and some pieces were given as prizes for the most distinguished soldiers.

25|$|Palme's {{decision}} {{to visit the}} Grand Cinema was made at very short notice. Lisbet Palme had discussed seeing a film {{when she was at}} work during the afternoon, and called her son, Mårten Palme, at 17:00 to talk about the film at the Grand Cinema. Olof Palme did not <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> plans until at home, at 18:30, when he met with his wife, by which time Palme had already declined any further personal bodyguard protection from the security service. He talked to his son about the plans on the phone, and they eventually decided to join Mårten and his girlfriend, who had already purchased tickets for themselves to see the Swedish comedy Bröderna Mozart ("The Mozart Brothers") by Suzanne Osten. This decision was made about 20:00. The police later searched Palme's apartment, as well as Lisbet's and Mårten's work places, for wire-bugging devices or traces of such equipment, but did not find any.|$|E

She eventually decided that the reason she didn't like the book was her own selfishness in seeking to fulfill her own desires rather than leaving her desires for God to work out. She then read the book again, and wrote that God used her reading of it to make her thankful for her time as a single person. She also wrote that she found the book to be [...] "mostly about letting God's love overflow into all areas of your life rather than tales of perfect Christian couples." ...|$|E

However, in May 2015, The Hollywood Reporter stated that Walt Disney Studios had chosen not to continue with a third installment, which was confirmed by Wilde the following month. In the end of July, Boxleitner stated he frequently heard about the pre-production of Tron 3 while shooting Cedar Cove in Vancouver, and was disappointed to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cancellation. While expressing the opinion that Disney decided to [...] "play it safe" [...] and explore other properties, Boxleitner said that this broke his interest in continuing with the franchise, as [...] "it's been too up and down for me.

500|$|After {{leaving the}} diner, Mulder returns to their motel and finds {{the men in}} black seen earlier (played by Jesse Ventura and Alex Trebek), in Scully's room.

Chung dismisses Mulder and publishes the book anyway, which Scully reads in her office. In his book, Chung describes the fates of the various people he interviewed: Roky has moved to California and founded a spiritual cult based on the teachings he believes he received from Lord Kinbote, Blaine has replaced him as a power company lineman and continues to search for UFOs most nights, Mulder (whom Chung describes as [...] "a ticking time bomb of insanity") watches video footage of Bigfoot, and Harold professes his love to Chrissy, who rejects him as too immature, as her UFO experience has given her a new commitment to philanthropy and helping humanity. The voice-over ends with Chung concluding that evidence of extraterrestrial life remains elusive.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Grant starred {{opposite}} Drew Barrymore in {{a parody}} of pop culture and the music industry called Music and Lyrics. The Associated Press described it as [...] "a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy that's simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough." [...] Though he neither listens to music nor owns any CDs, Grant learned to sing, play the piano, dance (a few mannered steps) and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare {{for his role as}} a has-been pop singer, based loosely on Andrew Ridgeley, the lesser-known member of 1980s pop duo Wham!. The Star-Ledger dismissed the performance, writing that [...] "paper dolls have more depth." [...] The film, with its revenues totalling $145million, allowed Grant to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washed-up lead character. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, [...] "Grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to Alex's career: He's too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed, but he's far too brazen to feel anything like shame." [...] In 2009, Grant starred opposite Sarah Jessica Parker in the Marc Lawrence's romantic comedy Did You <b>Hear</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Morgans?, which was a critical failure but was a box office success. He reunited with Lawrence again for a dramedy film The Rewrite, starring opposite Marisa Tomei. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews, while Grant's performance was praised by many critics. Director Quentin Tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favorites of the year and called Grant a [...] "perfect leading man." [...] In 2015, he had a supporting role as Alexander Waverly in Guy Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Entertainment Weekly described his performance as [...] "the only bit of fun" [...] in the film. Glenn Kenny of Rogerebert.com gave film a mixed review but stated that [...] "while it can’t be said that Hugh Grant saves the movie, his return to prominence in the last half-hour, after a plot-seeding-walk-on earlier in the movie, peps things up considerably." ...|$|E
