5|$|As Corporal Bill Taylor of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, {{the player}} starts off by playing {{a part in}} D-Day, at the assault of Pointe du Hoc, to destroy a German {{artillery}} battery, and <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> a massive German counter-offensive in the following mission. Soon after, the player captures a nearby town {{and serves as a}} sniper against mortar crews until reinforcements arrive. The second objective is focused on Hill 400, involving the capture of Bergstein, a disastrous charge at Hill 400's bunkers and the defense against the German counterattack, with the player again performing sniper work against German mortar teams, destroying enemy armor, and generally holding the hill against the counter-offensive, all the while burdened by artillery and overwhelming numbers of German soldiers. The final mission is set amongst the Americans in the Rhine River crossing into Germany. It begins {{as one of the few}} missions with the player immediately under fire, providing cover fire against the Germans until reaching the river banks and then fighting through most of the town. The final fight has the player defeat two German Tiger I's.|$|E
25|$|The key pinch is {{a simple}} grasp in which the thumb applies force to an object to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> the lateral side of the index finger. Restoring this {{function}} allows a patient to hold objects such as a fork or pen that are necessary for {{activities of daily living}} such as eating, self-grooming and self-catheterization.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Günzburg on 9 October 1805 saw General of Division Jean-Pierre Firmin Malher's French {{division}} {{attempt to}} seize a crossing over the Danube River at Günzburg {{in the face}} of a Habsburg Austrian army led by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Mack von Lieberich. Malher's division managed to capture a bridge and <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> Austrian counterattacks. The battle occurred during the War of the Third Coalition, part of the larger Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

25|$|In April, the Marauders {{were ordered}} by General Stilwell {{to take up}} a {{blocking}} position at Nhpum Ga and <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> Japanese attacks, a conventional defensive action for which the unit had not been equipped. At times surrounded, the Marauders coordinated their own battalions in mutual support to break the siege after a series of fierce assaults by Japanese forces. At Nhpum Ga, the Marauders killed 400 Japanese soldiers, while suffering 57 killed in action, 302 wounded, and 379 incapacitated due to illness and exhaustion. Of the unit's 200 mules, 75 were killed by artillery and mortar fire. A concurrent outbreak of amoebic dysentery (contracted after linking up with Chinese forces) further reduced their effective strength. Although the Marauders had previously avoided losses from this deadly disease (in part by use of halazone tablets and strict field sanitation procedures), their encampment with Chinese infantry, who used the rivers as latrines, proved their undoing (the Chinese troops, who always boiled their drinking water, were not seriously affected).|$|E
25|$|At Troyes, Schwarzenberg's 90,000 {{troops and}} Blücher's 50,000 faced about 75,000 {{soldiers}} under Napoleon. Though he outnumbered the French emperor by nearly two-to-one, Schwarzenberg's intelligence services consistently overestimated enemy strength. His troops had worn-out uniforms and were short {{of food in}} an area that had been stripped of supplies by both armies. On 22 February the French probed the Allied positions from Méry to Troyes. Marshal Nicolas Oudinot's infantry cleared Méry of Allied troops and gained a foothold on the far bank, but they could not <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> Allied counterattacks. In this clash, 3,600 men from Pierre François Joseph Boyer's division fought against 5,000 Russians from Alexei Grigorievich Scherbatov's VI Infantry Corps of Fabian Wilhelm von Osten-Sacken's command and 1,200 Prussians from Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg's I Corps. That night Schwarzenberg directed his army to withdraw behind the Seine River, except for Ignaz Gyulai's III Corps, which would move southeast to Bar-sur-Seine.|$|E
25|$|The German {{advance to}} Paris was halted by the Second Battle of the Marne. After years of {{stalemate}} on the Western Front, {{the war was}} finally coming to an end. In the last 100 days, the 50th Battalion fought at the Battle of Amiens on August 8–10; the Second Battle of the Somme (1918), which was {{also known as the}} Battle of Arras; the Battle of Cambrai, where they helped recapture Cambrai and <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> German attacks; the battle of Drocourt-Quéant where the 50th Battalion helped to defeat the German defensive line; the Battle of the Canal du Nord, where the Canadian Corps, with 50th Battalion crossed the canal; and the Battle of Valenciennes, one of the last battles of the war, where Mons was captured. By then, the Germans were retreating from France and Belgium. On November 11, on the eleventh hour, the Germans agreed to an armistice, ending the First World War.|$|E
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that at least 10,000 refugees have fled into Thailand to escape the violence. DKBA rebels took the town of Myawaddy on 9 November, and were <b>holding</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> government forces.

25|$|Taksin took {{important}} {{steps to}} show that he was a worthy successor to the throne. He was said to take an appropriate treatment to the remnants of the ex-Royal Family, arranged a grand cremation of the remains of Ekatat, and tackled the problem of locating the capital. Possibly, Taksin realized that Ayutthaya city had suffered such vast destruction that to restore it to its former state would undoubtedly have strained his resources. The Burmese were quite familiar with the various routes leading to Ayutthaya, and in the event of renewal of a Burmese attack on it, the troops under the liberator would be inadequate for the effective defence of the city. With these considerations in mind, he established his capital at Thonburi, nearer to the sea than Ayutthaya. Not only would Thon Buri be difficult to invade by land, it would also prevent an acquisition of weapons and military supplies by anyone ambitious enough to establish himself as an independent prince further up the Chao Phraya River. As Thonburi was a small town, Prince Tak's available forces, both soldiers and sailors, could man its fortifications, and if he found it impossible to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> an enemy's attack, he could embark the troops and beat a retreat to Chantaburi.|$|E

500|$|Delany {{auditioned for}} the role of Bree for the series' pilot episode in 2004. Cherry offered her the role three times, but she {{rejected}} it, and Marcia Cross was hired soon after. Delany turned down the role because she believed the Bree character was too similar to her character on Pasadena. Cherry acknowledged that while Delany captured the slyness he had originally intended for the character, Cross ultimately became the better choice: [...] "Marcia, who {{will be the first to}} tell you, 'I'm not funny, I never get the joke,' her Bree was kind of oblivious to her own Breeness. Interestingly enough, when we went forward with the show, it became a much funnier character than I envisioned." [...] While developing the Katherine character, Cherry immediately offered the role to Delany. [...] "That's unusual in Hollywood," [...] Delany commented. [...] "Usually when you say 'no,' they <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> you for the rest of your career. I've experienced that." ...|$|E

Reynolds is killed and the Union troops are pushed back, but at nightfall they entrench on high ground while the Confederates celebrate what appears to them to be another Lee victory.|$|R

The tone of the bell will continue to resonate, decaying naturally until it stops completely or the ringer stops it by damping the bell with a hand or on the body or a padded surface.|$|R
500|$|Though {{he stands}} five feet, nine inches tall, Cammalleri's {{teammates}} have argued his small stature {{is not a}} drawback. While at Michigan, teammate Craig Murray said that [...] "a lot of people look at his size and they <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> him, but there's no one stronger out there." [...] On the ice, Cammalleri says he tries to play bigger than his opponents. His coach at Michigan, Red Berenson, agreed. He stated that Cammalleri played like he was [...] "6-foot-4" [...] with the puck and could beat any opponent one-on-one. The Hockey News rates his offensive skills and intelligence on the ice as his greatest strength, but notes {{that he can be}} inconsistent away from the puck. He is a natural goal scorer, and is capable of playing at either centre or on the wing. Injuries have been a concern for Cammalleri; his time in Montreal were marked by both shoulder and knee problems.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] blends {{pulsating}} {{industrial and}} dance beats with elements of trance. The chorus has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast {{them with the}} hard beats. The song features a dubstep-influenced breakdown, in which Spears moans and blows kisses, and the song ends with a final chorus with elements of rave. The lyrics portray the singer seducing someone on the dancefloor, and the chorus revolves around pick-up lines. After the song was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it for being similar to their 1979 hit [...] "If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You <b>Hold</b> <b>It</b> <b>Against</b> Me". They were sued by Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard for defamation and libel, but the case was dismissed after The Bellamy Brothers apologized. McKee stated {{in an interview that}} the title was inspired by a discussion she had with Katy Perry about the latter's body.|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it {{for being}} {{similar to their}} 1979 hit [...] "If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You <b>Hold</b> <b>It</b> <b>Against</b> Me". In a statement, David Bellamy said [...] "professionally, well, in all honesty, we feel {{completely}} ripped off. Where's the originality?" [...] The brothers's attorney Christopher E. Schmidt stated that [...] " [...] becomes somewhat uncanny if you simply double {{the beat of the}} Bellamy Brothers' song and match it up with Britney's version" [...] and pointed out that it {{was not the first time}} Martin and Luke were accused of copyright infringement. On March 2, 2011, Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard filed a lawsuit in which they accused the brothers of making defamatory and libelous statements about them. The case was dismissed on August 11, 2011. The Bellamy Brothers released a statement that said, [...] "The Bellamy Brothers apologise to Dr. Luke and Max Martin for the Bellamys' public statements and any false impressions suggested by the statements on their website that Dr. Luke and Max Martin copy the works of others." ...|$|E

5000|$|While {{his parents}} are away for the weekend, Benny invites a girl (Ingrid Stassner) he has seen outside the local video store to his home. He shows her the video of the pig slaughter, and {{they talk about the}} film. She: [...] "Did you make this film? How was it, with the pig? I mean, {{have you ever seen a}} dead person--a real one, I mean?" [...] Benny: [...] "No. I once saw a TV program about the tricks they use in action films. It's all ketchup and plastic," [...] and then he unveils and loads the {{slaughtering}} gun. He <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> his chest, and dares the girl to discharge it. When she refuses, he calls her a coward (Feigling!). He <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> her chest, and when he hesitates, she calls him a Feigling also. He fires the gun, and she falls. Her falling reveals a video monitor, on which we see her crawling away from Benny and completely out of frame, Benny running to reload the gun and returning to shoot her a second time, the girl crawling back partially into frame, Benny again reloading and firing, this time apparently at her head, and, finally, her body remaining still.|$|R

500|$|Beginning in April 1985, Madonna {{embarked}} {{on her first}} concert tour in North America, The Virgin Tour, with the Beastie Boys as her opening act. She progressed from playing CBGB and the Mudd Club to playing large sporting arenas. The tour saw the peak of Madonna wannabe phenomenon, with lots of female attendance dressing like the singer. At that time, she released two more hits, [...] "Angel" [...] and [...] "Dress You Up", making all four singles from the album peak inside the top five on the Hot 100 chart. In July, Penthouse and Playboy magazines published a number of nude photos of Madonna, taken in New York in 1978. She had posed for the photographs as she needed money at the time, and was paid as little as $25 a session. The publication of the photos caused a media uproar, but Madonna remained [...] "unapologetic and defiant". The photographs were ultimately sold for up to $100,000. She referred to these events at the 1985 outdoor Live Aid charity concert, saying {{that she would not}} take her jacket off because [...] " [...] might <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> me ten years from now." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone {{commented that}} the song [...] "recalls the synth-gloom {{ambience}} of Britney's 2007 gem, Blackout." [...] He also compared the riff to AC/DC's [...] "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" [...] (1976). The hook was noted by Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times to be reminiscent of [...] "(I Just) Died in Your Arms" [...] (1986) by Cutting Crew. Nick Levine of Digital Spy felt the song had a [...] "clubby and au courant" [...] feel, comparable to [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] (2010) by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing Inc., [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] {{is set in the}} compound meter time signature, with a moderate dance beat infused metronome of 133 beats per minute. Lyrically, [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] talks about seducing someone on the dancefloor. The chorus revolves around pick-up lines; Spears sings, [...] "If I said I want your body now, would you <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> me?" [...] and [...] "'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight." [...] James Montgomery of MTV compared the feeling of the lyrics to that of [...] "If U Seek Amy" [...] (2009).|$|E
500|$|... "Hold It Against Me" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Max Martin, Dr. Luke and Billboard, with additional writing by Bonnie McKee. After it was written, Luke and Martin {{wanted to give}} the track to American recording artist Katy Perry, but they decided that [...] "it definitely wasn't a Katy Perry record." [...] They continued to work on the song with Billboard; Luke commented, [...] "I wanted to make sure it didn't sound like everything else I've done. [...] It can be hard in the verse, and the bridge is super, super hard, but the chorus is super-pop." [...] After rumored lyrics for the song surfaced on the web, Luke commented in his Twitter account on December 9, 2010, [...] "I / we never wrote a song called 'don't <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> me'.... BewaRe of InaccuraTe info kids-) We did write 'hold it against me' but those lyrics are NOT the lyrics ...." [...] It was reported by news outlets that [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] would premiere on January 7, 2011. However, this was denied by Spears' manager Adam Leber. An early demo of the track performed by McKee was leaked on January 6, 2011. Spears released the cover art for the song that same day and commented via Twitter, [...] "Heard an early demo of my new single leaked.

2500|$|The British {{were further}} cheered {{by the news}} that Amherst had taken Fort Carillon (after which it was renamed Fort Ticonderoga, {{as it is known}} today) and a second {{expedition}} had captured [...] Fort Niagara. The French and their native allies were now under increasing pressure, compounded by guerrilla activities spearheaded by Britain's Mohawk allies and Rogers' Rangers. Despite the celebrated victory at Quebec, the campaign was not over—the French still had significant forces at large in North America swelled by refugees from the surrounding countryside. The following spring the French regrouped and launched an attempt to retake Quebec. The Battle of Sainte-Foy took place on 28 April 1760 and proved even bloodier than the previous battle. Though the French prevailed, the British were able to retreat into Quebec and <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>against</b> a siege that lasted for a fortnight.|$|E
2500|$|West {{earned her}} first Top 40 hit in 1963 with [...] "Let Me Off at the Corner", {{followed}} {{a year later}} by the Top Ten duet with Jim Reeves [...] "Love Is No Excuse".

The single made Dottie the first female country artist to win a Grammy Award (Best Female Country Vocal Performance), leading to an invitation to join the Grand Ole Opry. [...] "Here Comes My Baby" [...] reached No.10 on Billboard Magazine's Country charts in 1964. After releasing the Here Comes My Baby LP in 1965, Dottie and producer Chet Atkins reunited the following year for Suffer Time, which generated her biggest hit yet in [...] "Would You <b>Hold</b> <b>It</b> <b>Against</b> Me". In 1967, the West/Atkins pairing issued three separate albums: With All My Heart and Soul (featuring the No.8 smash [...] "Paper Mansions"), Dottie West Sings Sacred Ballads and I'll Help You Forget Her.|$|E
