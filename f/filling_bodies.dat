The filling materials are mainly aeolian sands, fly ash, cement, special auxiliary materials and water of certain percentages. The percentages of water is less than 35 % (paste-like fill). 50 entries of No. 2301 working face have been filled with a total volume of 52000  m 3. The strength of <b>filling</b> <b>bodies</b> after 28  days reached 5.30  MPa. The filling ratio was between 50 % and 70 %. After the backfilling, the surface subsidence decreased by more than 50 %. Geological survey showed that the water tables decreased by about 0.45 – 2.76  m and the depths of water table was controlled {{in the range of}} 4 – 6  m.|$|E

A mechanical model of the support structure for the gob-side entry retention was first established. Then, field observations and laboratory tests were used to obtain the force exerted by the coal wall on the main roof, {{the relationship between the}} axial bearing capacity and compression ratio of the rubble inside the gob, the supporting force exerted by the rubble and <b>filling</b> <b>body,</b> and the thrust of the rubble on the <b>filling</b> <b>body.</b> The shear stress experienced by the roadside <b>filling</b> <b>body</b> of the gob-side entry retention in working face No. 41101 was calculated to be 15. 89 MPa. To meet the needs of roadside support, an innovative roadside backfill–truss support structure was adopted, with a 60 ° angle of inclination used for the anchor bolts of the gob-side entry retention structure. In this way, the ultimate shear strength was improved by 107. 54 % in comparison with the cement-based <b>filling</b> <b>body...</b>|$|R

The results show that there exists similarity in variation trend between correlation dimension and maximum Lyapunov exponent during each loading stage, which also verifies the disorder and chaos often reflect the complexity of fractal. Before the <b>filling</b> <b>body</b> gets to the instability, the correlation dimension declines continuously. So the <b>filling</b> <b>body’s</b> unstable failure is a kind of ordered dimension reduction process. Such kind of characteristic can be as a criterion condition for <b>filling</b> <b>body’s</b> failure.

In deep mining, filling rate and internal friction angle of <b>filling</b> <b>body</b> are the main factors that greatly influence both sides of plasticity zone breadth {{in the process of}} <b>filling</b> <b>body’s</b> deformation and destruction. Taking filling rate and friction angle as the main variables to make a numerical simulation analysis on the deep mine working face, we can find a conclusion that it shows a concave-down power exponent relationship between the width of plasticity zone and the filling rate; With lower filling rate, it shows a concave-up power exponent relationship with friction angle, and the relationship of power exponent will change into the linearity as the filling rate increase...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the characteristics of}} the acoustic emission (AE) and electrical resistivity of cemented coal gangue backfill (CGB) under uniaxial compression, the variations in these characteristics at 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days are analyzed by means of a stress-strain-resistivity-AE test, and the microperformances are investigated. The research results indicate that the AE can reflect the initiation and propagation of cracks and later explain the variation of the resistivity of the specimens under the uniaxial loading. The cumulative energy curve of AE is approximately two straight lines corresponding to the peak stress, and the difference in the linear slope gradually decreased with the increasing curing time due to the lower pore solution content and the compact pore structure. The relationships between the stress and resistivity and the loading condition before and after the peak stress at different curing times were established. Therefore, it is of great significance to predict the stability of the <b>filling</b> <b>body</b> by monitoring the AE and resistivity variations of the <b>filling</b> <b>body.</b> In addition, it is possible to calculate the roof stress using the relation equation between the resistivity and stress...|$|R
