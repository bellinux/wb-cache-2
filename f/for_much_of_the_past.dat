2500|$|The city's history {{dates back}} three millennia. As {{the last of}} the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the {{political}} center of the country <b>for</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> eight centuries. With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides, in addition to the old inner and outer city walls, Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital. Beijing was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium A.D. The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates. Its art treasures and universities have made it center of culture and art in China. Encyclopædia Britannica notes that [...] "few cities in the world have served for so long as the political headquarters and cultural centre of an area as immense as China." [...] Beijing has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites – the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, Zhoukoudian, as well as parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal, all popular locations for tourism. Siheyuans, the city's traditional housing style, and hutongs, the narrow alleys between siheyuans, are major tourist attractions and [...] are common in urban Beijing. The city hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and was chosen to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to ever host both Winter and Summer Olympics.|$|E

5000|$|When it was {{completed}} in late 1930, the Mariner Tower’s four elevators were state of the art, and prominently mentioned in news stories. They had electronically controlled stopping and leveling mechanisms, which meant elevator operators {{no longer had to}} use finesse and guesswork to stop the car at the correct spot. Original tenants of the Tower included commercial and medical offices, stores, and a restaurant. <b>For</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> medical and law offices occupied most of the space. In 1971, Mariner Realty sold the building to Towne Realty. By the early 1990s, with the downturn of the Westown neighborhood, only a third of The Wisconsin Tower’s space was leased. From 1994 until 2002, Milwaukee Business Training Institute relocated to this site and leased four floors of the building. For a time, the penthouse on the 21st floor was occupied by the popular Milwaukee rock and roll radio station FM 93 WQFM, which went off the air in 1996. The Tower also housed a Milwaukee Police Station and later, the Public Service Ambassadors from their inception in 1999 until 2003. In 2004, developer Dave Leszczynski, owner of City Real Estate Development, bought the building and began the condominium renovation you see today.Building History is from: Wisconsin Tower Condominium Resident's Handbook ...|$|E
