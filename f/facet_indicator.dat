5000|$|Common {{auxiliaries}} are aspect-free {{concepts that}} can be used in combination with any other UDC code from the main classes or with other common auxiliaries. They have unique notational representations that makes them stand out in complex expressions. Common auxiliary numbers always begin with a certain symbol known as a <b>facet</b> <b>indicator,</b> e.g. [...] (equal sign) always introduces concepts representing the language of a document; (0...) numbers enclosed in parentheses starting with zero always represent a concept designating document form. Thus (075) Textbook and =111 English can be combined to express, e.g.(075)=111 Textbooks in English, and when combined with numbers from the main UDC tables they can be used as follows: 2(075)=111 Religion textbooks in English, 51(075)=111 Mathematics textbooks in English etc.|$|E
5000|$|The {{notation}} is retroactive using uppercase alphabetic characters omitting I and O, {{with the}} addition of slash / and parentheses ( [...] ) which have specific anteriorizing functions. Retroactive notation requires that the classifier combines terms in reverse schedule order. This has the benefit of producing a compact notation by removing the need for <b>facet</b> <b>indicators.</b>|$|R
40|$|Classification is a {{fundamental}} tool in the organisation of any library collection for effective information retrieval. Several classifications exist, yet the pioneering Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) still constitutes {{the most widely used}} scheme and international de facto standard. Although once used for the dual purpose of physical organisation and subject retrieval in the printed library catalogue, library classification is now relegated to a singular role of shelf location. Numerous studies have highlighted the problem of subject access in library online public access catalogues (OPACs). The library OPAC has changed relatively little since its inception, designed to find what is already known, not discover and explore. This research aims to enhance OPAC subject searching by deriving facets of the DDC and populating these with a library collection for display at a View-based searching OPAC interface. A novel method is devised that enables the automatic deconstruction of complex DDC notations into their component facets. Identifying facets based upon embedded notational components reveals alternative, multidimensional subject arrangements of a library collection and resolves the problem of disciplinary scatter. The extent to which the derived facets enhance users' subject searching perceptions and activities at the OPAC interface is evaluated in a small-scale usability study. The results demonstrate the successful derivation of four fundamental facets (Reference Type, Person Type, Time and Geographic Place). Such facet derivation and deconstruction of Dewey notations is recognised as a complex process, owing to the lack of a uniform notation, notational re-use and the need for distinct <b>facet</b> <b>indicators</b> to delineate <b>facet</b> boundaries. The results of the preliminary usability study indicate that users are receptive to facet-based searching and that the View-based searching system performs equally as well as a current form fill-in interface and, in some cases, provides enhanced benefits. It is concluded that further exploration of facet-based searching is clearly warranted and suggestions for future research are made. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Beliefs about personhood are {{understood}} to be {{a defining feature of}} individualism-collectivism (I-C), but they have been insufficiently explored, given the emphasis of research on values and self-construals. We propose the construct of contextualism, referring to beliefs about the impor- tance of context in understanding people, as a facet of cultural collectivism. A brief measure was developed and refined across 19 nations (Study 1 : N = 5, 241), showing good psychometric properties for cross-cultural use and correlating well at the nation level with other supposed <b>facets</b> and <b>indicators</b> of I-C. In Study 2 (N = 8, 652), nation-level contextualism predicted ingroup favoritism, corruption, and differential trust of ingroup and outgroup members, while control- ling for other facets of I-C, across 35 nations. We conclude that contextualism {{is an important part of}} cultural collectivism. This highlights the importance of beliefs alongside values and self- representations and contributes to a wider understanding of cultural processes...|$|R

Epistemologically, comfort can be understood under the theory of complexity, since it emerges from a chain of interrelationships between man and several elements of the system. This interaction process can engender extreme comfort associated to the feeling of pleasure and wellbeing or, on the other hand, lead to discomfort, normally followed by pain. This article has for purpose {{the development of a}} theoretical model that favours the comfort feature on automobile seats through the identification of its <b>facets</b> and <b>indicators.</b> For such, a theoreti-cal study is resorted to, allowing the mapping of elements that constitute the model. The results present a comfort model on automobile seats that contemplates the (physical, psychological, object, context and environment) facets. This model is ex-pected to contribute with the automobile industry for the development of improvements of the ergonomic project of seats to increase the comfort noticed by the users...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an introductory overview of many-facet Rasch measurement (MFRM). Broadly speaking, MFRM {{refers to a}} class of measurement models that extend the basic Rasch model by incorporating more variables (or facets) than the two that are typically included in a test (i. e., examinees and items), such as raters, scoring criteria, and tasks. Throughout the chapter, a sample of rating data taken from a writing performance assessment is used to illustrate the rationale of the MFRM approach and to describe the general methodological steps typically involved. These steps refer to identifying facets {{that are likely to}} be relevant in a particular assessment context, specifying a measurement model that is suited to incorporate each of these facets, and applying the model in order to account for each facet in the best possible way. The chapter focuses on the rater facet and on ways to deal with the perennial problem of rater variability. More specifically, the MFRM analysis of the sample data shows how to measure the severity (or leniency) of raters, to assess the degree of rater consistency, to correct examinee scores for rater severity differences, to examine the functioning of the rating scale, and to detect potential interactions between <b>facets.</b> Relevant statistical <b>indicators</b> are successively introduced as the sample data analysis proceeds. The final section deals with issues concerning the choice of a...|$|R
40|$|Introdução: o projeto pedagógico do Curso de Medicina da Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Goiás surgiu da experiência de, aproximadamente, 30 anos. Foi materializado em 2005, com o parecer de autorização do Conselho Nacional de Educação, após a homologação das Diretrizes Curriculares Nacionais. Com isso, a necessidade de aprofundar o estudo com o desenvolvimento dos processos avaliativos capazes de auxiliar a identificação, o acompanhamento e a efetivação das mudanças na formação médica. O pressuposto teórico adotado na pesquisa sustenta a viabilidade de quantificar a atuação profissional no encontro clínico. Objetivos: avaliar alguns componentes do encontro clínico no modelo biopsicossocial; construir um instrumento de autopercepção deste encontro; testar o instrumento de avaliação nesta vivência; e quantificar as variáveis categóricas da pesquisa em uma turma de Medicina da Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Goiás. Metodologia: pesquisa quantitativa, {{longitudinal}} e coorte prospectiva. O grupo do estudo foi composto por 39 acadêmicos da V Turma de Medicina da PUC Goiás e a pesquisa constituída de duas etapas com um intervalo de 1 ano entre as aplicações dos dois protocolos acadêmicos, após a conclusão da unidade de Semiologia Médica. As dimensões avaliadas na pesquisa foram: biomédica, cognitiva, ecossistêmica, psicológica e bioética. O instrumento de avaliação foi construído com 5 dimensões, 18 facetas e 72 indicadores, divididos em blocos de quatro alternativas para cada faceta, escalonadas em graus, zero, 1, 2 ou 3. Quanto maior o grau, maior a complexidade voltada para o modelo biopsicossocial, representada pelo programa informacional desenvolvido pelo pesquisador, denominado Project 2. Resultados: por meio de um perfil radial, circular, com um ponto central e três áreas com raios crescentes, graduadas por diferentes tonalidades de cor, foi possível representar o encontro clínico utilizando a autopercepção dos sujeitos. Os resultados serviram para testar a consistência do software, com controle de qualidade para todas as respostas. Utilizando a estatística descritiva, o crescimento do desempenho do grupo do estudo foi observado matematicamente, quando comparadas as respostas em porcentagem nas duas etapas da pesquisa. Houve associação fraca entre as variáveis categóricas (facetas) utilizando a relação do teste Qui-Quadrado com o Coeficiente V de Cramer, com exceção das facetas: Análise Crítica (p 2 = 0, 002); Determinantes Sociais de Saúde (p 2 = 0, 007); e Promoção da Saúde (p 2 = 0, 049). Na autopercepção, tomando como referências as respostas nas facetas, 26 sujeitos (66, 7 %) demonstraram crescimento no processo de formação, 6 (15, 4 %) apresentaram declínio e 7 (17, 9 %) ficaram inalterados. Conclusão: utilizando o protocolo acadêmico e o Instrumento de Autopercepção do Encontro Clínico no Modelo Biopsicossocial, foi possível avaliar quantitativamente o desempenho acadêmico enquanto conhecimentos, habilidades e atitudes relacionados à prática clínica. O Instrumento da Autopercepção criado para a representação gráfica deste encontro foi testado e cumpriu com todos os objetivos propostos. A avaliação do grupo do estudo refletiu o processo ensino-aprendizagem da Instituição de Ensino (PUC Goiás), com prática pedagógica problematizadora na visão biopsicossocial. Com intervalo de um ano entre as etapas, houve crescimento das autopercepções dos desempenhos dos sujeitos da pesquisa 2, 9 vezes maior que as respostas representadas por declínio. Como visão de futuro, há possibilidade de utilizar a metodologia da pesquisa para perenizar o processo avaliativo dos acadêmicos, propiciar reflexões sobre os desempenhos individuais nas diferentes fases da formação médica, criar um novo cenário nos portfólios acadêmicos como recurso de avaliação na história curricular e possibilidade de adaptar o instrumento para aplicar em outros cursos e profissionais da área da saúde que desenvolvem ambientes clínicos. Introduction: The Pontifical Catholic University of Goiás pedagogical {{project for}} its medical course has {{stemmed from a}} thirty year long dream. It came into existence in 2005 following the authorization granted by the National Council of Education after the homologation of the National Curricular Guidelines. The present study shows the need to further investigate the development of assessment processes which are used to identify, follow and materialize changes in medical training. The theory used lies {{on the possibility of}} quantifying the medical performance in the patient-physician encounter. Objective: to evaluate some components of the patient-physician encounter based on biopsychosocial model; to create an assessment tool to measure the self-perception of this encounter; to test the effectiveness of this tool in this scenario; and to quantify the category variables of the research in a Pontifical Catholic University of Goiás medical course. Materials and Methods: This was a quantitative, longitudinal and cohort study. The study group presented 39 medical students from 5 th Class of the Pontifical Catholic University of Goiás Medical School Course and the investigation was divided into two stages with a year interval between the application of the required academic protocols preceded by a medical semiological conclusion. The dimensions under observation were the following: biomedical, cognitive, ecosystemic, psychological and bioethical. The assessment tool was designed to present 5 dimensions, 18 <b>facets</b> and 72 <b>indicators,</b> divided into groups of four alternatives per facet, scaled in degrees 0, 1, 2 or 3. The higher the degree, the higher the complexity of the biopsychosocial model represented by the software program developed by the researcher called Project 2.

The assessment tool was designed to present 5 dimensions, 18 <b>facets</b> and 72 <b>indicators,</b> divided into groups of four alternatives per facet, scaled in degrees 0, 1, 2 or 3. The higher the degree, the higher the complexity of the biopsychosocial model represented by the software program developed by the researcher called Project 2. Results: Through a circular radial profile with a central point and three areas with crescent spirals graded by differing shades of colors, {{we have been able to}} represent the clinical encounter, using the individuals self-perception. The results showed the effectiveness of the software, following a quality control process across all responses. We have used descriptive statistics to mathematically analyze the increase in the study group performance, and compare the responses in percentages in the two stages of the study. We have found a weak association between the category variables (facets) using the Chi-square ratio with the Cramer s-V Coefficient, except for the following facets: Critical Analysis(p 2 = 0, 002); Social Health Indicators (p 2 = 0, 007); e Health Promotion (p 2 = 0, 049). As for individual self-perception, having the facet responses as a reference, 26 subjects (66, 7 %) showed growth in the formation process; 6 (15, 4 %) showed decrease and 7 (17, 9 %) remained unaltered. Conclusion: Through the use of the academic protocol and the biopsychosociallybased patient-physician self-perception assessment tool we have been able to quantitatively assess the academic performance as to knowledge, skills and medical attitudes displayed in the interaction of the physician with the patient. The selfperception assessment tool designed to graphically represent such encounters was put to test and has fulfilled all its objectives. The evaluation of the study group evidentiated some biopsychosocially practices in the pedagogical process used by the Pontifical Catholic University of Goiás Medical School. After a year interval between the stages of the study, an increase was observed in the self-perception of the individuals performance 2, 9 times as high as the decrease responses. A long-term application of our findings include opportunities to use this methodology for an on-going self-evaluation of the medical students, provide insights about individual performance in the different stages of the medical training, create a new scenario in the academic portfolios as an evaluation and curricular history resource, and finally adjust the assessment tool so that it could be used by other courses and professionals in the health area working in clinical settings...|$|R
