5|$|Once, Khandoba and Mhalsa {{play a game}} of saripat (translated as game of dice or chess). Khandoba loses {{everything}} to Mhalsa in the wager, except his dhoti, his flag, his staff (wand) and his bhandari, the bag of magical bhandara (turmeric powder). In a dream, he sees Banai and falls in love with her. He goes on a hunt in the forest, gets away from the army and stays with Banai for twelve years. He marries her in non-ritualistic marriage and brings her back to Jejuri. A variant describes how Khandoba arrives in Chandanpur on a hunting expedition and becomes thirsty. A Dhangar directs him to Banai's vada. Banai offers him water or sends a pot of water, in which Khandoba reads Banai's name. In another version, the pot with nine jewels is a sign for Khandoba to recognise Banai, the <b>girl</b> <b>he</b> saw in his dream. He falls for her and loses purposefully in saripat with Mhalsa and accepts a twelve-year exile. In this period, he disguises himself as an impoverished, old leper and becomes a man-servant of Banai's father. Some folk songs have erotic overtones, for example, some songs give erotic descriptions of Banai's beauty which maddens Khandoba.|$|E
5|$|The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover were {{released}} {{together on a}} single reel, approximately 1,000 feet in length, on December 9, 1910. Both films are comedies, but Thanhouser advertisements refer to The Girls He Left Behind Him as a drama. The individual lengths of the reels are not known for certain, but the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation lists The Girls He Left Behind Him as being three-quarters of a reel and The Iron Clad Lover as half a reel in length. This is listed as an approximation of the relative expected lengths of the production, {{which could have been}} about 625 feet and 400 feet in length and still be a single reel. Very few advertisements for the films have been found, but the films likely had a wide national release. One advertisement featuring both films was found in Missouri, but The Girls He Left Behind Him was advertised without its other half and with slightly different spellings in Wisconsin and another Missouri theater. Selig would release a similarly titled work The <b>Girl</b> <b>He</b> Left Behind in 1912.|$|E

5|$|Fitzgerald's {{visits to}} Long Island's south shore and his {{experience}} attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsbys setting. Today, {{there are a}} number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book. One possibility is Land's End, a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party. Many of the events in Fitzgerald's early life are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota, and like Nick, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton (in Nick's case, Yale). Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby, in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the <b>girl</b> <b>he</b> loved. Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant, and was stationed at Camp Sheridan, in Montgomery, Alabama. There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named Zelda Sayre. Zelda finally agreed to marry him, but her preference for wealth, fun, and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success. Like Nick in The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting, and, like Gatsby, he had always idolized the very rich. In many ways, The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted, even as she led him toward everything he despised.|$|E
