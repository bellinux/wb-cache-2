5|$|After the {{experience}} of World War II, Belgium abandoned its neutral stance in international politics, in favour of military, political and economic integration. In 1949, Belgium joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deployed troops to fight alongside other United Nations forces in the Korean War in 1950. Belgium was also {{a key player in}} the unsuccessful negotiations about the creation of a European Defence Community (EDC) in the 1950s. Belgium was assigned a sector of the British zone in West Germany, around the city of Cologne, which it occupied from 1945. Belgian soldiers remained in Germany until their <b>final</b> <b>withdrawal</b> in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 SDSR {{delayed the}} project {{which became a}} {{competition}} between Thales and Lockheed to supply Crowsnest, a bolt-on sensor package that can be carried by any Merlin HM2. The Thales pod {{is based on the}} Sea King's Searchwater 2000; Lockheed had intended to use a derivative of the F-35's APG-81 radar but is now believed to be using an Elta system. Both systems will begin flight trials in the summer of 2014 ahead of Main Gate in 2016. Ten pods are planned with IOC in 2019. Until the Crowsnest system is available, a small force of Sea King ASaC.7 helicopters will remain in service with 849 Naval Air Squadron after the <b>final</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of the remainder of the Royal Navy's Sea Kings.|$|E
50|$|The <b>final</b> <b>withdrawals</b> were 1-2, 6, 15-17, 19, 25, 27 and 31-32 in 1973 and 12 and 29D in 1974.|$|R

5|$|Upon the {{withdrawal}} of HMS Ark Royal in 1978, the Phantoms of the Fleet Air Arm were {{turned over to the}} RAF and used to form a second squadron at Leuchars. At the time, 111 Squadron was stationed there operating the FGR.2 version of the Phantom, having been there since 1975. In 1979, to save costs resulting from the differences between the FG.1 and FGR.2, the squadron converted to the ex-Navy aircraft and the FGR.2 airframes were distributed to other Phantom units. Both 43 and 111 Squadrons retained the FG.1 until 1989, when they converted to the new Tornado F.3. Following the standing down of the two operational squadrons and the <b>final</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of the type from service, the bulk of the RAF's FG.1 Phantoms were scrapped. The RAF lost eight of their FG.1s in crashes throughout the type's twenty year service.|$|E
5|$|In May 1982, three Phantoms from 29 Squadron were forward {{deployed}} to RAF Wideawake on Ascension Island to provide air {{cover for the}} RAF's operations during the Falklands War, replacing Harriers of 1 Squadron, which were transiting to the war zone. In August 1982, {{following the end of}} the conflict and the reconstruction of the runway, 29 Squadron detached a number of its aircraft to RAF Stanley to provide air defence for the Falkland Islands. Late the following year, 23 Squadron took up the role, remaining stationed there until October 1988, when they were replaced by 1435 Flight. To make up for the loss of an entire squadron from the UK Air Defence Region, the RAF procured 15 second-hand F-4J Phantoms that had previously been used by the US Navy. These aircraft were operated by 74 Squadron from 1984 until 1991, when they were replaced by FGR.2 Phantoms that had been released by other squadrons following their conversion to the Tornado. Initially, it was intended that Phantoms and Tornados serve alongside each other. A total of 152 Tornado F.3s were ordered for the RAF, enough to convert four squadrons of Phantoms and two of Lightnings, but insufficient to completely convert every air defence squadron. Both 23 and 29 Squadrons converted from the Phantom FGR.2 to the Tornado between 1987 and 1988, alongside the conversion of the final two remaining Lightning squadrons. The intention was to retain a pair of UK based Phantom squadrons at RAF Wattisham, alongside a pair of Tornado units at RAF Coningsby to provide air defence cover for the southern half of the UK Air Defence Region. Another two squadrons stationed in Germany would also be retained. The end of the Cold War however led to a more rapid withdrawal of Phantom units than had originally been planned; under the Options for Change defence review the Phantom was to be withdrawn from service, with the two Germany based units disbanded as part of the gradual run down of the RAF's presence, and a {{reduction in the number of}} air defence squadrons leading to the two UK based units being disbanded in late 1992. However, just prior to the <b>final</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of the Phantom, it was recalled operationally as a result of Operation Granby, the UK's participation in the First Gulf War, when a total of six aircraft from 19 and 92 Squadrons were forward {{deployed to}} provide air defence cover at RAF Akrotiri; this was to replace the Tornados that had been originally deployed there on exercise, and were subsequently sent to the Gulf region. Following their <b>final</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from service, with a few exceptions, the bulk of the RAF's FGR.2 fleet was scrapped. Over its service life, 37 FGR.2s were lost to crashes.|$|E

25|$|In addition, BR built 2537 steam {{locomotives}} in {{the period}} 1948–1960, 1538 to pre-nationalisation designs and 999 to its own standard designs. These locomotives had short working lives, some as little as five years, because {{of the decision to}} end the use of steam traction by 1968, against a design life of over 30 years and a theoretical <b>final</b> <b>withdrawal</b> date of between 1990 and 2000.|$|E
25|$|After the <b>final</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of Roman {{government}} and troops from Britain in 410, regular maintenance ended {{on the road}} network.

Systematic construction of paved highways did not resume until the building of the first turnpikes in the early 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Opinions {{concerning}} the war grew more polarized after the Selective Service System instituted a draft lottery in December 1969. Some 30,000 young men fled to Canada {{to evade the}} draft between 1970 and 1973. Tensions ran higher as well, especially after the fatal shooting of four students at Kent State University in 1970, which led to nationwide university protests, and the mid-1971 publication of the first Pentagon Papers. Antiwar protests ended with the <b>final</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of troops after the Paris Peace Accords were signed in 1973.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the ban on}} {{privately owned}} diesel {{locomotives}} operating on BR tracks, railway enthusiasts {{did not have to}} wait that long after the <b>final</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of the class to see a Deltic back on the mainline. Following participation in the hastily arranged 'Farewell to the Deltics' open day at British Rail Engineering Limited's Doncaster Works on 27 February 1982, 55 002 left Doncaster under its own power and ran back up the ECML to the National Railway Museum light engine; it was to be some years before a Deltic was officially allowed to run again on the mainline.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Army Group A had cut the BEF's {{lines of}} {{communication}} into France and driven it back towards the coast at Dunkirk, cutting off the British troops at Calais and Boulogne from the main force. When planning the evacuation from Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo), the BEF's commanders decided that Calais and Boulogne should still be held as supply points for further fighting or possible exit points for a <b>final</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> On 17 May, 1st S/L Bty was ordered back to Calais, a move made difficult because all the roads were choked with refugees. There it operated in the S/L role to defend the port.|$|E

25|$|The {{responsibility}} for military command remained with the British Crown-in-Council, with a commander-in-chief for North America stationed at Halifax until the <b>final</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of British Army and Royal Navy units from that city in 1906. Thereafter, the Royal Canadian Navy was formed, and, {{with the advent}} of military aviation, the Royal Canadian Air Force. These forces were organised under the Department of Militia and Defence, and split into the Permanent and Non-Permanent Active Militiasfrequently shortened to simply The Militia. By 1923, the department was merged into the Department of National Defence, but land forces in Canada were not referred to as the Canadian Army until November 1940.|$|E
25|$|The late 1950s {{to the end}} of the 1960s saw first a reduction, {{then the}} <b>final</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of Britain's fleet of steam locomotives. Mass {{withdrawals}} of older classes started towards the end of the 1950s, with many of the pre-grouping companies' engines being scrapped. BR built its last steam engine, appropriately named Evening Star at Swindon in 1960, by early 1966 the Western Region was the first to have no steam locomotives at all and the last pocket of steam traction was withdrawn in the North-West of England in 1968. The short narrow-gauge Vale of Rheidol Railway at Aberystwyth in Wales was the only exception: it was still steam-operated on its sale by BR in 1989.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, {{with the}} end of the Cold War and {{pressure}} from the East German population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the East Side Gallery preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were reunified as the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin again became the official German capital. In 1991, the German Parliament, the Bundestag, voted to move the seat of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999. On 18 June 1994 soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the <b>final</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of foreign troops allowing a reunified Berlin. Berlin's 2001 administrative reform merged several districts. The number of boroughs was reduced from 23 to 12. In 2006, the FIFA World Cup Final was held in Berlin.|$|E
50|$|After {{eight days}} of heavy {{fighting}} the Scots secured a bridgehead that was repeatedly counter-attacked by the Germans. All assaults were repelled but the Scots {{were unable to}} advance any further. The bridgehead was no greater than 900 meters long and 900 meters wide. Each time the Scots tried to expand the bridgehead they were met by heavy German counterattacks. Fighting took place until the <b>final</b> German <b>withdrawal</b> on 23 September and Ten Aard was finally liberated.|$|R
50|$|As {{a further}} step toward independence, the governor's Executive Council was {{merged with the}} Council of Ministers in 1957 to form the all-Nigerian Federal Executive Council. The NPC federal {{parliamentary}} leader, Balewa, was appointed prime minister.
