Such role includes the ethical commitment to facilitate learning processes, removing barriers to adult students’ entry and persistence in higher education. This paper describes the implementation of <b>flexible</b> <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> in a technology and industrial management graduate course targeted at adult students. Findings confirm that adult students welcome <b>flexible</b> <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> and choose the pathways that better suit their needs. Despite academic background differences success rates are adequate and similar for different <b>learning</b> <b>pathways,</b> showing that adult students are capable of bridging the gaps in their academic development. Findings also show that doubts related to the impact of some <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> on students’ academic integration are unfounded. Considering the positive results it is concluded that <b>flexible</b> <b>learning</b> <b>pathways,</b> together with <b>flexible</b> entry requirements, promote equity and access conditions to adult students. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Faced with {{increasing}} competition {{for students and}} funds, Australian universities hope that innovative technologies will provide the capability to offer <b>flexible</b> <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> that {{meet the needs of}} current and future students. However, the application of such technologies to develop an IT (information technology) degree for online external delivery is a difficult and complex process with both technological and human dimensions. Adopting a knowledge framework and a systems thinking approach can help IT educators to better appreciate the significance of their efforts to date, and give direction to future initiatives. This framework and approach is presented in this study as a stakeholder analysis that identifies the key actors, together with their viewpoints and perceptions that influence the outcome of curriculum externalisation projects...|$|R
40|$|Higher Education Institutions are {{increasingly}} {{called upon to}} provide more <b>flexible</b> student <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> – in degree {{programs as well as}} through the introduction of methods for micro-credentialing. However, the rhetoric of establishing such open and personalised <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> is far easier than the reality of implementation and organisational change. For instance, universities have long struggled to break away from the “credit hour ” even while learners are being challenged to be more independent in their learning choices and education needs. The intent {{of this paper is to}} explore new models of education that embrace open <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> for lifelong <b>learning</b> and productive participation in the information age. The paper draws on the recent research and experiences gained from running a simultaneous xMOOC and cMOOC (a dual layer MOOC) using newly developed software based on the principles of student self-regulated learning. The software, ProSOLO, links a user’s nominated learning goals and experiences directly with their achievement of stated competencies. This process provides learners with greater autonomy in their study by removing the rigidity of more traditional education programs and offers new models of micro-credentialing...|$|R
40|$|In a {{changing}} world, the EU needs {{to develop a}} smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. These three mutually reinforcing priorities should help the Member States deliver high levels of employment, productivity and social cohesion. Adapting the education and training systems across Europe is crucial for the accomplishment of these objectives. This adaptation should aim to facilitate lifelong <b>learning,</b> mobility and <b>flexible</b> <b>learning</b> <b>pathways,</b> and comply more efficiently {{with the demands of}} the labour market. In this context the “Europe 2020 ” strategy is the EU's growth strategy for the coming decade [1] 1. A strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET 2020) [2] was set up in order to achieve the modernization of the education systems at all levels (school, vocational and higher education) and the promotion of lifelong learning. Developing the competence-based qualification system for the nuclear energy sector is part of achieving the four freedoms of a free market: free movement of goods, services, capitals and workers. In particular, CB-QS addresses the achievement of the 4 th freedom: the free movement of the workers. In this context, the challenge is to achieve the EU Single Market as a fully functional free market. The EU Single Market is one territory without any internal borders or other regulatory obstacles which accounts for 510 million consumers and 21 million SMEs.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{understanding}} of academics, and students around <b>Flexible</b> <b>Learning</b> degrees in relation to pedagogy, {{and the implications of}} these perspectives for the design of effective <b>Flexible</b> <b>Learning</b> curriculum. It adopted an evaluation research methodology to investigate the <b>Flexible</b> <b>Learning</b> degrees in Computing offered at the Institution where I work during the years 2008 - 2010. Using open ended questionnaires, interviews and a reflective journal, data were gathered on participant perspectives on the following key areas of research interest: concepts of Flexible Learning; the <b>Flexible</b> <b>Learning</b> environment; the role of the tutor/ lecturer; the role of the learner; availability of information, resources and services; concepts of learning and the learning process. Questionnaire data and interviews were analysed using qualitative analysis to identify conceptual categories and the findings were further supported and explored by the reflective writing where personal observations were recorded, in addition to the literature. The main conclusions of the study were that: (1) learning is central to the way the Institution provides resources; (2) the design of a <b>Flexible</b> <b>Learning</b> environment influences student learning; (3) student progress depends largely on the lecturer and the feedback provided; and (4) the structure of a <b>Flexible</b> <b>Learning</b> degree must promote employability. The conclusions of the study are related to both the academics and the students. It is agreeable throughout the research that <b>Flexible</b> <b>Learning</b> requires highly motivated academics and students.

40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} based upon the author's experience of strategic planning for open and <b>flexible</b> <b>learning</b> in Australia, the Caribbean and Asia, his writings in Latchem & Hanna (2001), and the work of others in the field. The paper is designed as a guide for institutions formulating strategic plans for open and <b>flexible</b> <b>learning.</b> It argues that moving into open and <b>flexible</b> <b>learning</b> represents a major paradigm shift and that the reasons for the change and nature of the change must be carefully thought through. The institutional strategic focus must be clear, all of the stakeholders must be consulted, and all of the desired changes must be negotiated throughout the institution. Without these steps, moving into open and <b>flexible</b> <b>learning</b> and re-engineering the roles and procedures will be difficult. The very process of developing a strategic plan helps staff appreciate trends and advances, comprehend the overall vision and mission, and discuss and agree on priorities and goals for open and <b>flexible</b> <b>learning.</b> The paper includes two case studies.

Executive summary The research for Putting the Jigsaw Together focused on the provision of education for disadvantaged young people through <b>flexible</b> <b>learning</b> programs in Australia. The overall goal of the project was to both assess and enhance the potential of <b>flexible</b> <b>learning</b> programs to contribute to marginalised young people’s learning and wellbeing, as well as to national educational attainment and social inclusion goals. The research found: 	There are three broad structural categories of <b>flexible</b> <b>learning</b> programs: programs operating within mainstream schools, programs operating within TAFE or ACE, and separate (stand alone) programs. 	Nationally there are over 900 <b>flexible</b> <b>learning</b> programs, educating over 70, 000 students each year. 	About one-third of programs offer credentials at both junior and senior secondary level. Almost half offer only junior secondary credentials and almost one-fifth only senior secondary credentials. About half of the programs also offer accredited VET certificates across a wide range of industries. 	Almost all programs indicate they target young people who are at risk of non-completion and early school leavers, reinforcing their shared mission of providing education opportunities for young people who may otherwise miss out on crucial secondary schooling.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{results to}} be {{contributed to the}} field of Environmental Education. It is a new arena for qualifications development and implementation in the South African Education and Training system. The study is located {{in the context of a}} joint research programme focusing on understanding issues of articulation and <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> development for sustainable development, established between the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) in partnership with Rhodes University, Environmental Learning Research Centre (ELRC). Phase 1 of the SAQA/ELRC research showed that researching workplace learning requires an understanding of <b>learning</b> <b>pathways,</b> if it is to be meaningful. It is for this reason that this research in phase 2 focuses specifically on <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> in the context of a local municipality in Makana. Using a case study research approach and qualitative data, this study investigated <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> for three occupational categories at different levels in the Makana Municipality: 1) key managerial occupations; 2) key supervisory occupations; and 3) key workers occupations relevant to sustainable development and how they are shaped and experienced. It also identified system and structural factors influencing articulation and access issues relevant to progress in <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> relevant to these key occupations. The study was designed using a case study research. Primarily, qualitative research techniques were employed to generate data, including observations, interviews and document analysis. The study used inductive, abductive and retroductive modes of inference to interpret and analyse data, using critical realist and systems perspectives. The findings on worker <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> show that there is a discrepancy between the Training Policy and the Environmental Training and Education Strategy of Makana Municipality. The issue of complexity in <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> and social structural factors such as inequality emerged as factors that strongly influenced <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> for workers. <b>Learning</b> <b>pathways</b> for workers involved in sustainable development practices hardly existed or simply did not exist. Interesting transitions associated with <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> such as from home, to work or no schooling in the case of the workers, showed a pattern of emergence. These showed that <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> are not accessible and equally available to everyone as can often erroneously be assumed. The findings on supervisor <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> show diverse complexities as well as related issues, when compared to the worker’s <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> Issues such as overlapping of study and work emerge as influential to supervisor <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> Lack of support is, however, an influencing factor, but in a different context compared to the workers, and mainly focuses on lack of bursaries, highlighting training policy issues. This aspect was found to also relate to lack of proper resources in order to enable them to learn and do their job better; an issue raised by the workers too. This challenge of lack of support in various forms posed a barrier to <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> Findings related to the manager’s <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> show a noticeable gap between the workers, supervisors and managers. The manager’s generally have higher education qualifications related to sustainable development, and in certain cases managers have had exposure to international training related to sustainable development. Factors such as ample opportunities for learning, mentoring, association on professional bodies, and decision making powers influenced the manager’s <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> It was also notable that while managers receive occupationally directed training, it is not necessarily sustainable development related. In theory, the results highlighted a need to understand systems as a whole and how their integration is important in influencing <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> There were also underlying mechanisms and structures identified which needed to be unravelled and understood as these were found to influence <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> in this study. The study highlighted critical insights in understanding how <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> in a local municipality context (the case of Makana Municipality) are constructed by both systems and structural factors in the workplace, while also identifying ways in which agency of those engaged in learning for sustainable development in workplaces is enabled and /or constrained by such factors.
