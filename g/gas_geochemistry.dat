40|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>geochemistry</b> {{and their}} {{associated}} isotope systematics are developing into powerful tools to understand geological/environmental processes and affirm source origins of geo-fluids. In {{addition to the}} traditional noble gas indicators, such as He and Ar, other major and trace gases, including CO 2, N 2, H 2, CH 4, CO, Ne, Kr and Xe – abundances and isotopes - have shown considerable application in many fields of the Earth and Environmental Sciences. For example, key constraints on geochemical processes including the degassing history of the solid Earth to form the atmosphere and oceans, the origin and migration characteristics of natural gas, the scale of climate variability, the P-T characteristics of both subaerial and deep water geothermal reservoirs, and {{the dynamics of the}} earthquake cycle, are only a few areas where <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry</b> has been successfully exploited. Following the ‘Frontiers in Gas Geochemistry’ Special Issue in this journal (2013), this volume will reflect this diversity in scope and application of <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry,</b> focusing on geothermal, tectonic and magmatic studies amenable to the <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry</b> approach...|$|E
40|$|This {{thematic}} {{issue of}} Geofluids includes 11 papers representing {{the three main}} topics discussed in the 10 th edition of the International Conference on <b>Gas</b> <b>Geochemistry</b> (ICGG- 10) : (i) gas in petroleum systems and seepage, (ii) gas in geothermal systems and volcanoes and (iii) gas, seismicity and geohazards. ICGG- 10 was held in 2009 in Romania, a country extraordinarily rich in surface gas manifestations, that offers innumerable opportunities for innovative studies on <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry.</b> We briefly describe the present knowledge on gases occurring both in petroliferous sedimentary basins and geothermal areas of Romania. The 11 contributions of this special issue, which include data from eight countries, are then summarised. Based on these papers and other works presented at the ICGG- 10, we find that significant advances in analytical capabilities, data treating and interpretation have led to innovative insights into the origin, distribution and environmental impact of gases migrating to the Earth’s surface.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{document}} the unsaturated zone (UZ) flow models and submodels, {{as well as the}} flow fields that have been generated using the UZ flow model(s) of Yucca Mountain, Nevada. In this report, the term ''UZ model'' refers to the UZ flow model and the several submodels, which include tracer transport, temperature or ambient geothermal, pneumatic or <b>gas</b> flow, and <b>geochemistry</b> (chloride, calcite, and strontium) submodels. The term UZ flow model refers to the three-dimensional models used for calibration and simulation of UZ flow fields. This work was planned in the ''Technical Work Plan (TWP) for: Unsaturated Zone Flow Analysis and Model Report Integration'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 169654], Section 1. 2. 7). The table of included Features, Events, and Processes (FEPs), Table 6. 2 - 11, is different from the list of included FEPs assigned to this report in the ''Technical Work Plan for: Unsaturated Zone Flow Analysis and Model Report Integration'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 169654], Table 2. 1. 5 - 1), as discussed in Section 6. 2. 6. The UZ model has revised, updated, and enhanced the previous UZ model (BSC 2001 [DIRS 158726]) by incorporating the repository design with new grids, recalibration of property sets, and more comprehensive validation effort. The flow fields describe fracture-fracture, matrix-matrix, and fracture-matrix liquid flow rates, and their spatial distributions as well as moisture conditions in the UZ system. These three-dimensional UZ flow fields are used directly by Total System Performance Assessment (TSPA). The model and submodels evaluate important hydrogeologic processes in the UZ as well as geochemistry and geothermal conditions. These provide the necessary framework to test hypotheses of flow and transport at different scales, and predict flow and transport behavior under a variety of climatic conditions. In addition, the limitations of the UZ model are discussed in Section 8. 11...|$|R
30|$|The lower Tertiary Eh 3 {{is divided}} into two sections: the upper members of Eh 3 and the lower members of Eh 3 in the Biyang Depression. The first section is {{generally}} regarded as a key target of oil and gas exploration, but the resource potential of the lower members of Eh 3 has been neglected. We have obtained new knowledge about Eh 3 from comprehensive geological research. The lower members of Eh 3 are high-quality and main source rocks, which have good oil and gas resource potential. This is a new direction for oil and <b>gas</b> exploration. The <b>geochemistry</b> characteristics of source rocks of the lower members of Eh 3 in the lower Tertiary of the Biyang Depression were analyzed in detail. A basin modeling method was applied to hydrocarbon generation of the lower and upper members of Eh 3 source rocks, the oil and gas resource potential was comparatively analyzed, and then favorable tectonic zones were pointed out. In the lower members of Eh 3, a set of semi-deep lake to deep lake high-quality source rocks occurs rich in algae organisms, mainly of type II 1, with a high abundance of organic matter. Most of the source rocks are just in the peak stage of hydrocarbon generation, which is a favorable foundation for forming abundant oil and gas resources in the Biyang Depression. The comparative analysis of the hydrocarbon-generation quantities between lower and upper members of the Eh 3 source rocks shows that the lower members of Eh 3 have good oil and gas resource potential, and the hydrocarbon-generation quantity accounts for 51 % of the total in Eh 3. Specifically, the oil-generating quantity accounts for 50 % of the total and the gas-generating quantity accounts for two thirds of the total. Therefore, source rocks in the lower members of Eh 3 of the Biyang Depression have good oil and gas resource potential, which is a key factor for future deep oil and gas exploration.|$|R

At many Japanese volcanoes, plume height is monitored {{as an indicator of}} the apparent intensity of the volcanic plume (Volcanological Division, Seismological and Volcanological Department, JMA 2014). However, the visibility of the plume is highly affected by atmospheric conditions (Matsushima and Shinohara 2006), and the plume height is also influenced by wind conditions (Bursik 2001). Therefore, to monitor the plume activity, the apparent intensity of the plume has rarely been treated quantitatively.|$|E

40|$|The Samail {{ophiolite}} in Oman {{is undergoing}} modern hydration and carbonation of peridotite and may host a deep subsurface biosphere. Previous investigations of hyperalkaline fluids in Oman {{have focused on}} fluids released at surface seeps, which quickly lose their reducing character and precipitate carbonates upon contact with the O 2 /CO 2 -rich atmosphere. In this work, geochemical analysis of rocks and fluids from the subsurface provides {{new insights into the}} operative reactions in serpentinizing aquifers. Serpentinite rock and hyperalkaline fluids (pH > 10), which exhibit millimolar concentrations of Ca 2 +, H 2 and CH 4, as well as variable sulfate and nitrate, were accessed from wells situated in mantle peridotite near Ibra and studied to investigate their aqueous <b>geochemistry,</b> <b>gas</b> concentrations, isotopic signatures, mineralogy, Fe speciation and microbial community composition. The bulk mineralogy of drill cuttings is dominated by olivine, pyroxene, brucite, serpentine and magnetite. At depth, Fe-bearing brucite is commonly intermixed with serpentine, whereas near the surface, olivine and brucite are lost and increased magnetite and serpentine is detected. Micro-Raman spectroscopy reveals at least two distinct generations of serpentine present in drill cuttings recovered from several depths from two wells. Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) analysis of the lizardite shows a strong tetrahedral Fe coordination, suggesting a mixture of both Fe(II) and Fe(III) in the serpentine. Magnetite veins are also closely associated with this second generation serpentine, and 2 – 10 ?m magnetite grains overprint all minerals in the drill cuttings. Thus we propose that the dissolved H 2 that accumulates in the subsurface hyperalkaline fluids was evolved through low temperature oxidation and hydration of relict olivine, as well as destabilization of pre-existing brucite present in the partially serpentinized dunites and harzburgites. In particular, we hypothesize that Fe-bearing brucite is currently reacting with dissolved silica in the aquifer fluids to generate late-stage magnetite, additional serpentine and dissolved H 2. Dissolved CH 4 in the fluids exhibits the most isotopically heavy carbon in CH 4 reported in the literature thus far. The CH 4 may have formed through abiotic reduction of dissolved CO 2 or through biogenic pathways under extreme carbon limitation. The methane isotopic composition may have also been modified by significant methane oxidation. 16 S rRNA sequencing of DNA recovered from filtered hyperalkaline well fluids reveals an abundance of Meiothermus, Thermodesulfovibrionaceae (sulfate-reducers) and Clostridia (fermenters). The fluids also contain candidate phyla OP 1 and OD 1, as well as Methanobacterium (methanogen) and Methylococcus sp. (methanotroph). The composition of these microbial communities suggests that low-temperature hydrogen and methane generation, coupled with the presence of electron acceptors such as nitrate and sulfate, sustains subsurface microbial life within the Oman ophiolite...|$|R

40|$|This {{special issue}} is {{dedicated}} to Yuri Taran's outstanding contributions to <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry</b> {{that began in the}} early 1980 s with his work on deuterium and 18 O compositions of geothermal waters in the Mutnovsky (Kamchatka) region and continues to this day with work on the Kamchatka volcanic volatile budget, carbon isotopes of hydrocarbons, and new insights into the geochemistry of El Chichón volcano, Chiapas. Yuri has contributed greatly to the field of volcanic <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry</b> and was the first to recognize the distinct deuterium and oxygen isotopic composition of fumarole condensates from volcanoes in Kamchatka (Taran et al. 1987 a). The shift in δD and δ 18 O to significantly heavier values compared to local meteoric water led Yuri to introduce the term “andesitic water” (Taran et al. 1989 a, b) which has since been recognized at subduction zone volcanoes globally. This distinct isotopic composition is evidence that volcanoes release water that ultimately originates as subducted seawater and is recycled through the mantle wedge back to the earth's surface. Yuri's early work on the gas emissions from Kamchatka and Kurile Islands volcanoes also included the development and testing of gas geothermometers (Taran 1986) and investigating hydrothermal alteration using isotopic data (Taran et al. 1987 b). His curiosity remained focused on the isotope systematics of volcanic gases discharging from Kamchatka and the Kuriles through the late 1980 s and 1990 s with publications on the gas compositions of Klyuchevskoi (Taran et al. 1991), Mutnovsky (Taran et al. 1992), Avachinsky and Koryaksky (Taran et al. 1997). Yuri was involved in the discovery of a pure and unique rhenium mineral on Kudryavy volcano (Korzhinsky et al. 1994) and provided one of the most detailed chemical studies of high temperature (up to 950 °C) fumaroles to date of any volcano (Taran et al. 1995). His 1995 paper on Kudryavy remains highly cited and provides the highest quality volcanic gas data which also include trace elements from a subduction zone. Such data are crucial when we attempt to interpret lower temperature volcanic gas compositions or calculate rare metal fluxes from volcanoes worldwide. His most recent publication on Kamchatka-Kurile volcanic emissions provides a detailed analysis of the total gas flux from these volcanoes (Taran 2009) ...|$|E

40|$|Natural gas is an {{important}} transitional energy source to replace more carbon intensive coal combustion {{in the face of}} climate change and increasing global energy demands. A significant proportion of natural gas reserves (~ 20 %) were recently generated by microorganisms that degrade organic-rich formations (i. e. coal, shale, oil) in-situ to produce methane. Recent studies have shown that these microbial communities may be potentially stimulated to generate more methane to extend the lifetime (~ 10 years) of existing biogenic gas wells. This dissertation investigates how microbial coalbed methane (CBM) systems are impacted by geochemical conditions, microbial community composition, and groundwater recharge. The first study is a review and synthesis of existing basic research and commercial activities on enhancement of microbial CBM generation, and identification of key knowledge gaps {{that need to be addressed}} to advance stimulation efforts. The second study couples water and <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry</b> with characterization of microbial communities in coalbeds in the Powder River Basin (PRB), Wyoming to investigate the influence of microbiology on water and <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry.</b> Geochemistry results indicated that nutrients are likely source in situ from coal, and that all sulfate must be removed from the system before methanogenesis will commence. Increased archaeal (i. e. methanogens) diversity was observed with decreasing sulfate concentration, while sulfate reducing bacterial communities were different in wells with high sulfate concentrations (sulfate reducing conditions) when compared to wells with low sulfate concentrations (methanogenic conditions). The third study uses noble gases to constrain the residence time of groundwater associated with CBM in the PRB. Measured diffusional release rates of 4 He from PRB coals were ~ 800 times greater than typical rates observed in sandstone or carbonate aquifers, and measured 4 He values far exceeded expected values from in-situ decay of U and Th. Groundwater 4 He residence times ranged from < 1 to ~ 800 years using the measured diffusion rates versus ~ 130 to 190, 000 years using a standard model. Coal waters with the longest residence time had the highest alkalinity concentrations, suggesting greater extents of microbial methanogenesis, although there was no relationship between groundwater "age" and methane concentrations or isotopic indicators of methanogenesis. Constraining the relationship between microbial activity (e. g. mechanisms of coal biodegradation and methane generation), environmental geochemical conditions, and groundwater flow is important to better understand subsurface hydrobiogeochemical processes and to ensure the success of future projects related to stimulation of microbial CBM...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{monitoring}} of the integrity of onshore geological {{carbon capture and storage}} projects will require an approach that integrates various methods with different spatial and temporal resolutions. One method proven to be quite effective for site assessment, leakage monitoring, and leakage verification is near-surface <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry,</b> which includes soil gas concentration and gas flux measurements. Anomalous concentrations or fluxes, relative to the natural background values, can indicate the potential occurrence of a leak. However the natural background can be quite variable, especially for CO 2, due to biological production and accumulation in the soil that changes as a function of soil type, land use, geology, temperature, water content, and various other parameters. To better understand how these parameters influence natural, near-surface background values, and to examine the potential of different sampling strategies {{as a function of the}} survey goals, this paper reports results from two highly different case studies, one from northern Europe (Voulund, Denmark) and one from southern Europe (Sulcis, Sardinia, Italy).

40|$|Abstract: Mount Etna is {{important}} to the economy of eastern Sicily, with agriculture and summer and winter tourism providing employment for thousands of people. Although there are no permanent homes within 10 km of the summit, year-round human activities on the upper slopes are proliferating and the risks from even a small eruption are consequently magnified. The earliest form of monitoring at Etna, as for other volcanoes, was direct observation. Modern volcano monitoring at its most effective is a synergy between basic science and hazard assessment. A prerequisite oeffective monitoring is an understanding of volcanic structure and history. Sir Charles Lyell {{was among the first to}} make systematic observations ofMount Etna and laid the foundation of more modern studies. A huge array of monitoring techniques has been tested on Etna: methods that have proved successful in monitoring and sometimes in predicting eruptions include observations of seismicity, ground deformation and microgravity. These. together with electromagnetic, magnetic, <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry</b> and various remote sensing techniques have also provided key information on the volcanic plumbing system and the eruption process. Monitoring techniques were formerly based on the most easily measured phenomena: other effects were either not recorded orwere treated as noise. Future progress will be enhance...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of high volumes of methane during tunnelling operations {{is a critical}} safety factor that can influence the choice of different technical approaches for tunnel design and construction. Moreover, gas accumulation can be influenced by fluid migration along spatially focused preferential pathways (i. e. points along faults and fracture zones) that can result in highly variable gas concentrations along the tunnel trace. This paper proposes a methodological approach to minimise the risks, and costs, related to tunnel construction in rocks with potentially high methane concentrations. This approach combines soil <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry</b> and structural geology surveys along and across the main faults and fracture systems {{that occur in the}} study area. The procedure is based on near-surface sampling and consists of a two-pronged approach: the measurement of fault zone gas emissions and their classification as barrier or conduit zones. Moreover, it is illustrated the importance of measuring a wide spectrum of different gas species, not just methane, for a more accurate interpretation of the geological, geochemical, and structural system. This is due to the potential for multiple gas origins, different gas associations, and various alteration and oxidation processes (e. g., CH 4 oxidation into CO 2) that can modify the geochemical signal along the flow path as gas migrates towards the surface...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{surveys were}} {{performed}} in Medolla (Italy), a peculiar area characterized by spotty high soil temperature, gas vent, {{and lack of}} vegetation, to determine the migration mechanisms and spatial behavior of gas species. Hereby we present soil gas measurements and their isotopic ratios measured between 2008 and 2015, including the 2012 Emilia-Romagna seismic sequence. We found that soil gas concentrations markedly changed during the main shocks of May 20 and 29, 2012 (Mw 6. 1 and 6. 0, respectively), highlighting {{the presence of a}} buried fault intersecting the gas vents. We suggest that crustal dilation associated with seismic activity favored the uprising of geogas towards the surface. Changes in the isotopic signature highlight the contribution of two distinct sources, one deeper, thermogenic and another superficial related to organic-rich layer, whose relative contribution varied before, during and after the earthquake. We suppose an increase of microbial component likely due to the ground shaking of shallower layers linked to seismic sequence, which masks the thermogenic contribution. Although the changes we detect are specific for an alluvial plain, we deduce that analogous processes may be active elsewhere, and that soil <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry</b> represents an useful tool to discriminate the gas migration related to seismic activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of two high-temperature fumaroles, with <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry</b> compatible with an economic geothermal system, established Apacheta {{as one of}} the most attractive geothermal exploration prospects in northern Chile. These remote fumaroles at 5, 150 m elevation were first sampled in 1999 by ENAP and its partners, following up on the reports of a CODELCO water exploration well that flowed small amounts of dry steam at 4, 540 m elevation in the valley 4. 5 km east of the fumaroles. The prospect is associated with a Plio-Pleistocene volcanic complex located within a NW-trending graben along the axis of the high Andes. The regional water table is ~ 4, 200 masl. There are no hot springs, just the 88 °C steam well and the 109 ° and 118 °C fumaroles with gas compositions that indicate reservoir temperatures of ≥ 250 °C, using a variety of gas geothermometers. An MT-TDEM survey was completed in 2001 - 2002 by Geotérmica del Norte (SDN), an ENAP-CODELCO partnership, to explore the Apacheta geothermal concession. The survey results indicated that base of the low resistivity clay cap has a structural apex just west of the fumaroles, a pattern typically associated with shallow permeability within a high temperature geothermal resource. SGN plans to drill at least one exploration well in 2002 - 03 to characterize a possible economic resource at Apacheta...|$|E
40|$|The first direct {{indication}} of hydrocarbon occurrence in Remanso do Fogo area (Minas Gerais State, Brazil) was {{the existence of}} microseepages. However. Quaternary sedimentary cover in the area made the identification of new occurrences and associated controlling structures quite difficult. This study investigated the spatial distribution of hydrocarbon related gases in shallower to intrasedimentary depths in Remanso do Fogo area, using airborne gamma-ray spectrometry and magnetic data. The geophysical data were processed using techniques designed to suppress the influence of regional geological signatures. Known and possible new occurrences of microseepages were detected by mapping low residual potassium values and high uranium residual values in relation to potassium, termed as DRAD values, which resulted from the subtraction of potassium from uranium residual values, using a Thorium (Th) -normalizing approach. The validation of these occurrences was done based on. existing <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry</b> data in the soil. For the magnetic data, the amplitude of the analytic signal, combined with the total horizontal gradient of the subtraction between the 1200 - and 400 -meter upward continuations, enhanced the northwest- southeast and east west magnetic lineaments, which are partially related to the microseepages and the drainage of the area. The distinction of near-surface and deep signatures also allowed the general identification of intrasedimentary and basement structures, which are potentially controlling the occurrences of seepages in the area...|$|E
40|$|A {{clear and}} {{detailed}} understanding of gas migration mechanisms from depth to ground surface {{is fundamental to}} choose the best locations for C 02 geological storage sites, to engineer {{them so that they}} do not leak, and to select the most appropriate monitoring strategy and tools to guarantee public safety. Natural test sites (or "natural analogues") provide the best opportunity to study migration mechanisms, as they incorporate such issues as scale, long-time system evolution, and interacting variables that cannot be adequately addressed with laboratory studies or computer models. To this end the present work examines the migration to surface of deep, naturally produced C 02 along various buried and exposed faults in the Latera caldera (central Italy) by integrating structural geology and near-surface <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry</b> surveys. Results show how gas migration is channelled along discrete, high -permeability pathways within the faults, with release typically occurring from spatially restricted gas vents. Size, distribution, and strength of these vents appear to be controlled by the evolution and deformation style of the fault, which is in turn linked to the rheology of the lithological units cut by the fault. As such gas migration can change drastically along strike. Gas migration in the vadose zone around these vents is also discussed, focussing on how the physical-chemical characteristics of various species (C 02, CH 4, and He) control their spatial distribution and eventual release to the atmosphere.

40|$|Several gas seeps and near-surface {{gas hydrate}} {{deposits}} {{have been identified}} in 850 – 900 -m water depth on the continental slope offshore Batumi, Georgia (eastern Black Sea) using deep-towed high-resolution sidescan sonar data. The seeps are located on a ridge named Kobuleti Ridge separating two canyons: the Supsa canyon north of the ridge and the deeply incised central canyon south of it. The southern wall of this canyon shows signs for additional gas seeps. Gas seeps are shown by acoustic anomalies in the water column on raw sonar records and as high backscatter intensity areas on processed data. The seeps on Kobuleti Ridge are characterised by carbonate deposits at the centre and a much wider area where finely disseminated gas hydrates are present. Fractures of a NW–SE direction are present at the seep sites and are probably related to the formation and decomposition of gas. Individual sites of gas emission apparently exert their influence for a circular area of up to 40 m in diameter. <b>Gas</b> <b>geochemistry</b> from gravity cores shows high gas content and a mixture of biogenic and thermogenic gases together with the presence of gas hydrates. The seeps offshore Georgia are different from other known cold seeps in the Black Sea such as shallow water seeps of biogenic gas and deep water mud volcanoes. They are located in deep water within the zone of gas hydrate stability, lack significant relief and are characterised by active gas emission and the absence of mud volcanism...|$|E
30|$|Great {{volumes of}} shallow-buried (< 2, 000 m) natural gases which are mainly {{composed}} of biogases and low-mature gases {{have been found}} in the Mesozoic-Cenozoic sedimentary basins in China. Many shallow gas reservoirs in China are characterized by coexistence of biogas and low-mature gas, so identifying the genetic types of shallow gases is important for exploration and development in sedimentary basins. In this paper, we study the <b>gas</b> <b>geochemistry</b> characteristics and distribution in different basins, and classify the shallow gas into two genetic types, biogas and low-mature gas. The biogases are subdivided further into two subtypes by their sources, the source rock-derived biogas and hydrocarbon-derived biogas. Based on the burial history of the source rocks, the source rock-derived biogases are divided into primary and secondary biogas. The former is generated from the source rocks in the primary burial stage, and the latter is from uplifted source rocks or those in a secondary burial stage. In addition, the identifying parameters of each type of shallow gas are given. Based on the analysis above, the distributions of each type of shallow gas are studied. The primary biogases generated from source rocks are mostly distributed in Quaternary basins or modern deltas. Most of them migrate in watersoluble or diffused mode, and their migration distance is short. Reservoir and caprock assemblages {{play an important role in}} primary biogas accumulation. The secondary biogases are distributed in a basin with secondary burial history. The oil-degraded biogases are distributed near heavy oil pools. The low-mature gases are widely distributed in shallow-buried reservoirs in the Meso-Cenozoic basins.|$|E
