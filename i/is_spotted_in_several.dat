5000|$|The new mineral <b>was</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>in</b> <b>several</b> samples {{collected}} at Bingham, New Mexico and Mapimí, Durango, Mexico. It was first {{thought to be}} minium (lead tetroxide mineral) because of its high lead content, brown color and association with other lead oxide minerals plattnerite and murdochite. Its holotype specimen consisted of crystalline plates 25-30 micrometers (µm) across and 1-2 µm thick with the total weight below 1 mg. The flakes were collected from a fluorite, quartz, limonite and rosasite matrixes. Identification and characterization of scrutinyite by the standard X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was hindered by scarcity of material and strong signal interference with plattnerite. The unusual amount of effort required for the analysis resulted in its name derived from the word [...] "scrutiny". The holotype specimen is preserved in the US National Museum (catalog number NMNH 165479).|$|R
50|$|Early in the {{production}} of the story, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced a Parliamentary election. This created a sudden demand for BBC studio space, and as a result {{the production}} schedule for the story unexpectedly lost two weeks. Production was completed, but many signs of hurried production are evident. Many scenes had little or no rehearsal, and many scenes received only one take. Perhaps the biggest problem came with the Myrka costume. It was completed only an hour or so before it was scheduled to be used, so that the two puppeteers inside could not be fitted and had no time to rehearse in it. The costume smelled strongly of paint and adhesive, which one puppeteer said made him feel like he was sniffing glue. The paint on the costume had not dried by the time filming started, and tended to rub off on the sets and other costumes, as can <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>in</b> <b>several</b> scenes.|$|R

5000|$|Necromorphs - The main antagonists in the Dead Space series, they do {{not appear}} until Issue Zero (but not officially {{until the end of}} Issue Four). Their exact origin is unknown or at least unrevealed. They exist in {{multiple}} forms but only two types are seen in the animated comics. According to Marla, the Marker has a series of carvings that are actually a code for recombinant DNA, and it mutates genes at a cellular level once the host is dead. The suicides being prime targets as they were exposed the longest, they mutated and started walking shortly after the planet-crack. The Necromorphs attack humans (and possibly other sentient beings) and kill them, leaving them to be infected by another type of Necromorph that crawls around. After mutation, the body appears to rip itself open and develop extra limbs that are used to impale and tear apart their victims. From what is seen in the Fifth Issue, Necromorphs are not greatly affected from bullets, which would explain the need for a weapon to dismember them, which Neumann accomplishes with an axe (however, it is possible he may have only stunned the creature as he cut off its head, and according to the game designers, decapitation is often not enough to kill them and it would probably just make their attacks more frenzied, which in Neumann's case would have been hindered as they had trapped the creature behind an overturned table). Alien flesh that has <b>been</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>in</b> <b>several</b> locations of the colony, particularly the megavents, seems {{to have some sort of}} connection with the Necromorphs, which in the game turn out to be part of the Hive Mind.|$|R
40|$|Cell {{extracts}} {{and culture}} filtrates were prepared from several mycobacterial species {{and subjected to}} two-dimensional acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The cell preparations were first electrophoresed in a 7 % homogeneous gel followed by a second electrophoresis, {{at right angles to}} the first separation, in a 2 to 30 % linear gel gradient slab. Because the stained slab resembled a “fingerprint” or “peptide map,” this procedure has been called “electroprotein mapping. ” More than 200 protein-staining <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> detected <b>in</b> <b>several</b> of the cell extracts, each map being characteristic of the species examined. The single most characteristic portion of each map was the region between the 16 and 30 % gel concentrations. This region consisted of several small-molecular-weight components (many of peptide proportions) which together appeared as the most anodic band in the 7 % gel column (first separation). The number and location of these components in the linear gel slab (second separation) were specific for each species tested. By electrophoresis of molecular-weight markers (i. e., albumin, myoglobin, cytochrome c) with and across (transverse electrophoresis) the gel gradient, the relative molecular weights of the unknown cell extract components could be estimated. These results suggest that two-dimensional acrylamide gel electrophoresis is a useful tool for the characterization of mycobacterial cell constituents...|$|R
40|$|Optomechanical {{scanning}} {{systems with}} focused laser <b>spot</b> <b>are</b> used <b>in</b> <b>several</b> applications including microstereolithography (MSL), scanning optical tweezers, and laser cutting. Systems used {{so far in}} the literature for scanning a focused laser spot on a substrate are: (a) galvanomirror preobjective scanning, (b) galvanomirror postobjective scanning and (c) 'off-axis' lens scanning system (originally proposed by coauthors). Major performance criteria due to end application, (say for example, to obtain high resolution microdevices in MSL) translates into the following criteria on optical scanning system: (i) uniform spot size and (ii) uniform intensity profile over the entire range of scan. This paper presents comparative optical analysis, both theoretical and experimental, of these systems based on the proposed performance criteria. Optical analysis of the optomechanical scanning systems is carried out by using geometric ray tracing method. Image evaluation in this case is done using diffraction wave optics. Simulations are carried out to determine spot characteristics at image plane when scan distances are changed by moving optics in the above mentioned optomechanical scanning systems. Simulation and experimental results clearly show that there is lesser distortion of spot characteristics (size and intensity profile) in case of proposed off-axis lens scanning system as compared to other systems over wider scan range. Hence this system is more promising to fabricate high resolution micro- components and in general for other similar applications as well. (C) 200...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Τo provide {{insights}} on Lung Cancer (LC) {{and the associated}} risk factors before-after the economic crisis in Crete, Greece. To assess the smoking habits of LC patients during the austerity period. Material and Methods The {{study was conducted in}} Crete, Greece. Data (5, 057 LC cases) were obtained from the Cancer Registry of Crete (CRC). Age-Standardized Incidence and Mortality Rates (ASIR, ASMR/ 100, 000 /year), adjusted Charlson’s Comorbidity Index (CCI%), deprivation index (HPI- 2) and exposure to Outdoor Air Pollution (OAP) were estimated. The analysis was performed for two time periods (Period A: 1992 - 2008; Period B: 2009 - 2013). Results ASIR presented a significant increase during the economic crisis, while even higher increase was observed in ASMR (Period A: ASMR= 30. 5 / 100, 000 /year; Period B: ASMR= 43. 8 / 100, 000 /year; p< 0. 001). A significant increase was also observed in smokers (Variation rate= 7. 4; p= 0. 02) during the austerity period. After 2009, a significant increase of the LC hot <b>spots</b> <b>was</b> observed <b>in</b> <b>several</b> sub-regions of Crete (p= 0. 04), mainly due to smoking and deprivation levels increase. The risk of LC mortality increased even more among smokers (RR= 5. 7; 95 %CI= 5. 2 - 6. 3) and individuals living in highly deprived geographical regions (RR= 5. 4; 95 %= 5. 1 - 5. 8) during the austerity period. The impact of the multiple LC predictors resulted in adjusted RRs ranging from 0. 7 to 5. 7 within the island (p< 0. 05). Conclusions The increased LC burden after the onset of the economic crisis, along with a changing pattern of LC predictors stress the urgent need of targeted interventions and cancer control programs focusing on the most deprived or vulnerable population groups...|$|R
