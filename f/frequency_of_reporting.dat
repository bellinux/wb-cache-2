40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review {{was to assess the}} scientific literature in terms of pre-clinical studies evaluating the influence of material, surface and design on the integration of an implant by hard and soft tissues. The included publications were analysed with regard to the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> of criteria being derived from the ARRIVE guidelines. This served to trace elements within animal studies, where the quality of reporting needs to improve. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The literature search was performed in Ovid Medline and included English literature from January 1990 to July 2011. A list of 24 criteria derived from the ARRIVE guidelines for animal research was adjusted to implant studies on osseointegration in pristine bone and was applied to all included study manuscripts. Each criteria was graded by " 0 " (not reported) or " 1 " (reported) and the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> for each criteria was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 271 studies were included into this review. Generally the quality of reporting increased with time. Low frequencies of reporting were achieved for criteria like "randomisation of animals", "reasons for the animal model" and "relevance to humans". CONCLUSIONS: The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> showed high percentages for most criteria. However, the quality of reporting in pre-clinical studies needs to improve in areas like the reporting of statistical information, study setup and the possible translation of the results to humans...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{determine}} the accuracy and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> tuberculosis as either the contributing or underlying {{cause of death}} on death certificates in New York City during 1992. METHODS. Death certificates from 1992 that listed tuberculosis were matched with the New York City tuberculosis registry. For those persons who had tuberculosis listed {{as a cause of}} death, but who were not listed in the registry, medical records were reviewed. The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> tuberculosis on death certificates in patients who died with active tuberculosis was evaluated {{in the second part of}} this study. Death certificates of patients with active tuberculosis (persons who died within six months of starting anti-tuberculosis medications) in 1992 were reviewed. RESULTS. Tuberculosis was listed on 635 death certificates; 377 (59 %) were confirmed cases based on registry data. Reviews of medical records were possible for 230 (89 %) of the remaining 258 patients and confirmed only two additional tuberculosis cases. Of 310 persons who died with active tuberculosis in 1992 (second part of the study), only 104 (34 %) had tuberculosis listed on their death certificates. CONCLUSIONS.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the impact of {{residential}} respite care on disruptive behavior displayed by older people, particularly those with dementia. Methods: A quasi-experimental, repeated-measures, single-group design was used. The participants were a consecutive series of 100 older people with a mean age of 81. 8 years (range 66 - 96 years) who had been booked for a respite admission to one of several residential aged care facilities in a provincial Australian city. A diagnosis <b>of</b> dementia was <b>reported</b> for 29 % of the sample. Disruptive behaviors were rated before and after the period of respite by home caregivers (N = 100) and during the period of respite by nurses (N= 25) using the Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale (DBDS). Results: Age, male gender and the presence of dementia were all significantly related to the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> disruptive behaviors. Residential respite care was associated with a significant reduction in the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> disruptive behaviors in older people (Wald chi(2) = 28. 28, P < 0. 0001). However, this improvement in behavior did not persist into the post-respite period. The deteriorating behavioral trajectory that was evident prior to respite care continued following the period of respite care. Conclusions: Residential respite care was associated with a temporary diminution in the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> disruptive behaviors in older people. This finding should be reassuring both for family carets considering placing a relative in residential respite care and for health workers considering whether to recommend such a course of action...|$|R

METHODS: A population-based cohort of 2, 863 women studied between 2000 and 2004 {{was used to}} compare the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> symptoms (weight gain, nausea, breast tenderness, lower <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> menstrual periods, breakthrough bleeding, painful and heavy periods, swollen legs) by type of OCPs (classified by estrogen dosage, progestin component, and sequence of administration). RESULTS: Results show little variation in the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> symptoms by type of OCPs, with the exception of progestin-only pills being associated with higher <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> breakthrough bleeding and lower <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> menstrual periods. We found no decrease in the <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> symptoms with the reduction of estrogen dosage, nor with the use of third-generation OCPs compared with second-generation OCPs. Likewise, we found little variation by sequence of administration of OCPs (monophasic versus triphasic). CONCLUSION: In the absence of sufficient evidence-based data to support the existence of differences in the tolerance profile of low-dose combined OCPs, future well-designed randomized trials are needed to guide providers in their choice of OCPs. However, research should also assess the effectiveness of counseling on the tolerance of OCPs, an intervention that may prove to be more rewarding than basing the choice of OCPs on their theoretical properties.

METHODS: Data were extracted from certificates recording 981 deaths which occurred between 1985 and 1999 in people aged 45 years or more {{who participated in the}} UK Prospective Diabetes Study, to which 23 English, Scottish and Northern Ireland centres contributed. Diabetes (9 th revision of the International Classification of Diseases; ICD- 9 250) entered on parts 1 A- 1 C or 2 A- 2 C of the death certificate was considered as reporting diabetes. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine independent factors associated with the reporting of diabetes. RESULTS: Diabetes was reported on 42 % (419 / 981) of all death certificates and on 46 % (249 / 546) of those with underlying cardiovascular disease causes. Reporting of diabetes was independently associated on all death certificates with per year of age increase (OR 1. 02; 95 % CI 1. 001 - 1. 04, P = 0. 037), underlying cause of death (non-cardiovascular causes OR 0. 76; 95 % CI 0. 59 - 0. 98, P = 0. 035) and social class (classes I-II OR 1. 00; class III OR 1. 35; 95 % CI 0. 96 - 1. 89, P = 0. 084, classes IV-V OR 1. 48; 95 % CI 1. 05 - 2. 10, P = 0. 027). Stratification by age, sex, and underlying cause of death also revealed significant differences in the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> diabetes over time.

Methods A total of 5877 schizophrenia patients in nine Asian countries and territories were examined between 2001 and 2009. The patients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, prescription of psychotropic drugs, and drug-induced side effects were recorded using a standardized protocol and data collection. SD was evaluated as "present" or "absent" according to the clinical judgment of experienced psychiatrists. Results The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> SD in the whole sample in women and men was 3. 0 %, 0. 8 %, and 4. 6 %, respectively, with variations across study sites.
