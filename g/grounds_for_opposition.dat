60|$|Two Cases of Conscience.--"The curé {{said that}} unhappy lovers {{always talked about}} dying, {{but that it was}} very rare to find one who kept his word; still he had seen one case. It was that of a young man of family, called Soulpse. He {{fell in love with a}} young lady of beauty and of good character, but without money, and {{belonging}} to a dishonoured family. Her father was in the galleys for forgery. The young man, who foresaw all the opposition, and all the good <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>opposition,</b> that he would have to encounter among his family, did all that he could to cure himself of his passion; but when he was assured of the uselessness of his efforts, he plucked up courage to open the matter to his parents, who wearied themselves with remonstrances. Our lover suddenly stopped them short, saying, 'I know all that you have to say against me; I cannot disapprove of your reasons, which I should be the first to urge against my own son, if I had one. But consider whether you would rather have me dead or badly married; for it is certain that if I do not marry the woman that I love, I shall die of it.' They treated this speech as it deserved; the result does not affect that. The young man fell sick, faded from day to day, and died. 'But, Curé,' said I, 'in the place of the father, what would you have done?' 'I would have called my son; I would have said: Soulpse has been your name hitherto; never forget that it is yours no more; and call yourself by what other name you please. Here is your lawful share of our property; marry the woman you love, so far from here that I may never hear speak of you again, and God bless you. 'For my part,' said old Madame D'Esclavelles, 'if I had been the mother of the young madman, I would have done exactly as his father did, and let him die.' And upon this there was a tremendous division of opinion, and an uproar that made the room ring again.|$|E

The GWR offered to accommodate the traffic and to reimburse the expenses of the bill, but the promoters declined.

We hear, {{as a reason}} for clinging to Mr. Fox at present, that nine years ago Mr. Pitt got into power by mischievous intrigues with the court, with the Dissenters, and with other factious people out of Parliament, to the discredit and weakening {{of the power of the}} House of Commons. His conduct nine years ago I still hold to be very culpable. There are, however, many things very culpable that I do not know how to punish. My opinion on such matters I must submit to the good of the state, as I have done on other occasions,--and particularly with regard to the authors and managers of the American war, with whom I have acted, both in office and in opposition, with great confidence and cordiality, though I thought many of their acts criminal and impeachable. Whilst the misconduct of Mr. Pitt and his associates was yet recent, it was not possible to get Mr. Fox of himself to take a single step, or even to countenance others in taking any step, upon the ground of that misconduct and false policy; though, if the matters had been then taken up and pursued, such a step could not have appeared so evidently desperate as now it is. So far from pursuing Mr. Pitt, I know that then, and for some time after, some of Mr. Fox's friends were actually, and with no small earnestness, looking out to a coalition with that gentleman. For years I never heard this circumstance of Mr. Pitt's misconduct on that occasion mentioned by Mr. Fox, either in public or in private, as a <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>opposition</b> to that minister. All opposition, from that period to this very session, has proceeded upon the separate measures as they separately arose, without any vindictive retrospect to Mr. Pitt's conduct in 1784. My memory, however, may fail me. I must appeal to the printed debates, which (so far as Mr. Fox is concerned) are unusually accurate.|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{analyses}} {{were carried out}} on patents that deal with metallocenes (see Editor's note 1) {{that can be used}} as catalyst (component) for the (co) polymerization of olefins, polymerization catalysts containing these metallocenes, polymerization processes employing these catalysts, polymers obtained by such processes, blends containing these polymers, and further uses of these polymers or blends containing them, and on patents dealing with alumoxanes. A comparison of the number of patents granted in the United States and by the EPO shows that in the US more than twice the number of patents have been granted in these technical areas as compared to Europe. In the field of alumoxanes, where about 20 patents have been granted, only one opposition has been filed. In the field of metallocenes, it was found that 61 oppositions have been filed at the EPO against about 200 granted patents, or about five times the overall figure <b>for</b> <b>oppositions</b> at the EPO, indicating a high prevalence of oppositions in this field. An analysis of the <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> the <b>oppositions</b> revealed that all oppositions are filed at least on the grounds of lack of inventive step and/or lack of novelty. It turned out that the patents proprietary to different companies active in the field of metallocenes are not equally opposed, e. g. 60 % of the patents granted to Exxon are opposed, whereas about 8 % of the patents granted to Hoechst are opposed. Also the various companies in the field oppose a distinctly different number of patents. It was also found that in many opposition cases the same proprietor and the same opponent are a party. A family tree of US family members and their European relatives of patents dealing with metallocenes is discussed, showing further marked differences between the situation in the US and in Europe. ...|$|R
60|$|The reader sees, that I do {{not enter}} so fully into this matter as {{obviously}} I might. I have already been led into greater lengths than I intended. It is enough to say, that before the ministers of 1765 had determined to propose {{the repeal of the}} Stamp Act in Parliament, they had the whole of the American constitution and commerce very fully before them. They considered maturely; they decided with wisdom: let me add, with firmness. For they resolved, as a preliminary to that repeal, to assert in the fullest and least equivocal terms the unlimited legislative right of this country over its colonies; and, having done this, to propose the repeal, on principles, not of constitutional right, but on those of expediency, of equity, of lenity, and of the true interests present and future of that great object for which alone the colonies were founded, navigation and commerce. This plan I say, required an uncommon degree of firmness, when we consider that some of those persons who might be of the greatest use in promoting the repeal, violently withstood the declaratory act; and they who agreed with administration in the principles of that law, equally made, as well the reasons on which the declaratory act itself stood, as those on which it was opposed, <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> an <b>opposition</b> to the repeal.|$|R

We then explore these competing arguments through a reconstruction and comparison of the development of union positions on labour market activation over time in two countries, France and the Netherlands. The case studies suggest that union stances on these policies are not straightforwardly determined by the structure of labour market institutions; considerations regarding the impact of activation initiatives on the role of unions in the institutions of the welfare state {{play a major role in}} mobilizing their consent or dissent...|$|R

J. Howard Marshall neither set up a trust in Smith's favor, nor changed the terms of his will to provide for her after his death. However, he did make his existing trust irrevocable soon after his marriage to Smith. As a result, Smith was excluded from J. Howard's estate. She sued in Texas Probate Court for a share of the estate on several grounds, and her litigation was actively opposed by Marshall's son Pierce. The primary <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the son's <b>opposition</b> was that his father had an extensive estate plan executed over many decades which expressed his clear wishes.

Radnički Niš played 22 games across Europe against teams like S.S.C. Napoli, Dundee United, Grasshoppers Zürich, Feyenoord Rotterdam and other clubs. During this time, Radnički Niš lost in three years only one UEFA Cup home match of total 11 and this against a Yugoslavian team. A great contribution to this success had the Radnički Niš fans with their support. Their support includes the use of large and small flags, chanting and different sound elements. The Čair Stadium was a tough <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the <b>opposition</b> and the atmosphere created by Radnički Niš fans in a cracking stadium always gave hope to the team that they could overcome anybody. They achieved even the semifinals of UEFA Cup in 1982.

Radnički Niš fans attracted in this period {{for the first time}} also throughout Europe attention. Also legendary were the victory celebrations accompanied by Gajde, a traditional instrument that is typical for the region. After these great years, Radnički Niš relegated in 1984 in the Yugoslav Second League. A large organized support, after 1984, even with excellent attendance statistics, has been absent until 1989. That year in September, three days before the championship match against Red Star Belgrade, a decision was made that the club should have an organized fan group and that it should be shoulder-to-shoulder with the other fan organizations in Yugoslavia. There were several suggestions for a name, but the name Meraklije was chosen after a one-sided decision, as the groups name, mainly due to traditional reasons from the city of Niš. The name was originally proposed by Caci, a former well-known supporter. Meraklije is plural of the singular form Meraklija, which means something like [...] "neko kome je sve po meri, neko ko uživa u nečemu", which roughly translates to [...] "someone to just everything is right, someone who enjoys something". A person in this state are called a Meraklija. After a short time, the Meraklije had over 2000 members.|$|R
