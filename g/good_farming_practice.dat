40|$|Organic crop {{production}} seeks to produce high quality foods while reducing the inputs {{in order to}} promote environmental quality and conserve resources. This necessitates optimal production systems in terms of soil fertility and plant health. Studies in QLIF subproject 3 have shown that soils may gain an improved potential to release N from added amendments through adaptation of management practices.

Even under experimental worst-case conditions, pathogen transfer from soil treated with farmyard manure to vegetables was not substantial.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to describe possible actions able to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus Polish river loads with their spatial differentiation. Spatial modeling has been applied for the estimation of po-tential, application, and effects of such actions at different geographical scales. A GIS oriented model— MONERIS has been validated and applied to calculate possible nutrient reduction. The investigations show that WWTPs are the major source of phosphorus emission. The efficient reduction of P-emission is pos-sible by combining two actions: full implementation of the National Programme of Municipal Wastewater Treatment with the application of nonphosphate detergents. The possible reduction of total phosphorus emission can be as high as 30 – 50 % in 2015 for whole Vistula catchment (compared with the present state). The reduction of nitrogen emission is much more complex, as N-emission is arises mainly from diffuse sources—principally agriculture. The most important sources for emissions are via tile drainage and ground-water. In these cases the most promising actions are to increase the efficiency of fertilizer consumption and decrease the soil erosion.
