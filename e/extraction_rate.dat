The phytic acid has serious health concerns as it decreases the bioavailability of many essential minerals by interacting with multivalent cations and proteins to form complexes that may be insoluble or otherwise unavailable under physiologic conditions. This project is designed to increase the availability of minerals in flour with high and low <b>extraction</b> <b>rates.</b> In the present study three wheat varieties namely AARI- 11, Faisalabad- 08 and Lasani- 08 at different <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> were characterized with special reference to physico-chemical analysis. The grains of each wheat variety was tempered and then milled through Quadrumate Senior Mill and whole wheat flour was formed through Udy Cyclon Mill. The results showed that significant variations were found in physicochemical analysis and mineral profile of different wheat varieties. The test weight and thousand kernel weight ranged from 73. 79 to 76. 97 kg/hL and 40. 71 to 43. 85 grams, respectively, among different wheat varieties. The chemical parameters including moisture, ash, protein, fat and fiber contents were affected significantly by the wheat varieties and the <b>extraction</b> <b>rates.</b> The results exhibited variations among different <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> flour. It was revealed that 70 % <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> flour possessed the highest moisture (12. 36 %), wet and dry gluten contents (27. 56 % and 10. 58 %, respectively) where as the whole wheat flour exhibited the highest ash (1. 66 %), fat (2. 48 %), protein (12. 84 %) and fiber (1. 54 %) contents. Rheological characteristics i. e. Farinographic and Mixographic studies of the flour were significantly affected by the different <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> and wheat varieties. The whole wheat flour exhibited the highest mineral contents as compared to the flour with low <b>extraction</b> <b>rates.</b> Hydrochloric acid extractability of minerals was increased significantly with the increase in <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> and significantly affected by the <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> and wheat varieties. Low phytate flour was prepared through autoclaving, fermentation and enzymatic degradation of phytic acid. The phytic acid content was significantly affected by the different processing treatments. The highest phytic acid content was found in whole wheat flour. Sensory parameters of chapattis and naan demonstrated non significant (P> 0. 05) effect among the wheat varieties where as significant effect was observed among the <b>extraction</b> <b>rates.</b> The efficacy study was conceded and degraded phytic acid samples were fed to rats for the analysis of serum biochemical profile. Two year study i. e. 2011 and 2012 was carried out to check the efficiency of the product and then results of both years were compared.

40|$|The {{controversy}} regarding extractions for othodontic treatment continuers {{and today}} is invoked {{by some as a}} feature of the "standard of care. " For this and other reasons, it is necessary to have contemporary data on the general prevalence of orthodontic extractions and the interpractice range of <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> in current specialty practice and, if possible, also to establish possible reasons for, and consequences of, the extraction versus nonextraction decision. Although all treatment decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, practitioners appear to have personal preferences for or against extractions and hence adopt policies with different degrees of aversion to or bias toward extraction therapy. A number of factors enter into the extraction decision. These include features of the malocclusion, objectives of treatment, and the technique selected to accomplish desired results. The present study does not address such issues but merely serves to provide epidemiologic data to estimate extraction frequency in contemporary orthodontic practice. Accordingly, a telephone survey of all licensed orthodontists in Michigan was conducted to determine their subjective estimates of <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> for patients in their practices. There were 238 respondents, for a response rate of 90. 2 %. Reported rates range from 5 % to 87 %. We then selected five practices from the extremes of the reported <b>extraction</b> <b>rates.</b> Three practices from the high end and two from the low end were included for an examination of patient records. Records of a total of 438 patient whose treatment had been completed were reviewed. The actual <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> for these practices ranged from 25 % to 85 %, which differed considerably from the clinicians' subjective estimates. Differences ranged from an overestimate of about 20 % to a 15 % underestimate. Results from the survey indicate that a wide range of extraction frequency exists among orthodontists. The pilot study of the actual <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> suggests that discrepancies may exist between perceived and actual <b>extraction</b> <b>rates.</b> To obtain reliable estimates of <b>extraction</b> <b>rates,</b> it is therefore suggested that random sampling of a larger number of practices and objective evaluation of patient records are required rather than the use of questionnaires...|$|R

This causes a problem for its Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) system: Infiltrated water with thermal energy may be lost from the systems range if it is extracted with the accustomed control strategy. In this research project, an analytical model was built in an Excel work sheet, to quantify the thermal energy distribution within the subsurface under influence of infiltration and extraction by 2 hot wells and 2 cold wells. This quantification should help to gain insight in how to smartly manage thermal energy distribution through varying infiltration and <b>extraction</b> <b>rates.</b> Studying the physical processes concerning ATES, geohydrological subsurface characteristics, and ATES system characteristics {{led to the creation}} of the analytical model in which a variety of problem related parameters can be adjusted and ultimately the infiltration and <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> can be adapted.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} is used {{to evaluate}} mass flow and heat <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> from enhanced geothermal injection-production systems that are operated using either CO 2 or water as heat transmission fluid. For a model system patterned after the European hot dry rock experiment at Soultz, we find significantly greater heat <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> for CO 2 as compared to water. The strong dependence of CO 2 mobility (= density/viscosity) upon temperature and pressure may lead to unusual production behavior, where heat <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> can actually increase for a time, even as the reservoir is subject to thermal depletion. We present the first-ever three-dimensional simulations of CO 2 injection-production systems. These show strong effects of gravity on mass flow and heat extraction, due to the large contrast of CO 2 density between cold injection and hot production conditions. The tendency for preferential flow of cold, dense CO 2 along the reservoir bottom can lead to premature thermal breakthrough. The problem can be avoided by producing from only a limited depth interval {{at the top of}} the reservoir...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates how the {{extraction}} of natural resources is affected by expropriation risk. Conventional Hotelling-type theory suggests that <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> will increase when companies are faced with expropriation risk, because the value of resources left in the ground decreases. However, when capital investments {{are included in the}} framework there is a second effect of expropriation risk, which depresses investments in physical capital, leading to lower <b>extraction</b> <b>rates.</b> The total effect is theoretically ambiguous, and arguably depends on the capital intensity of the resource. I show that iron, bituminous coal and non-bituminous coal can be ordered in terms of capital intensity, from high to low, and use this information in a pooled OLS regression to show that the effect of expropriation risk is more negative the more capital-intensive the resource is. The effects are quite large: A one-standard deviation increase in the expropriation risk index is associated with 44 %, 37 % and 24 % decreases in the <b>extraction</b> <b>rates</b> of iron, bituminous coal and non-bituminous coal, respectively.
