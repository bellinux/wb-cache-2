5|$|Most high-energy particles, beside {{displacing}} carbon atom {{from the}} lattice site, also pass it enough surplus <b>energy</b> <b>for</b> a rapid migration through the lattice.

We found that the activation <b>energies</b> <b>for</b> lithium ion transfer at electrodes/ionic liquids were higher, {{when compared with the}} case of conventional organic electrolytes.

5|$|Remote {{observation}} of electrons requires detection of their radiated <b>energy.</b> <b>For</b> example, in high-energy environments {{such as the}} corona of a star, free electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to Bremsstrahlung radiation. Electron gas can undergo plasma oscillation, which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density, and these produce energy emissions that can be detected by using radio telescopes.|$|E
