Their mechanism of action is not completely understood and structural information is not available {{for any of the}} reaction intermediates. Near-atomic resolution crystallography supported by in crystallo Raman spectroscopy and QM/MM calculations showed unambiguously that the archetypical cofactor-free uricase catalyzes uric acid degradation via a C 5 (S) -(hydro) peroxide intermediate. Low X-ray doses break specifically the intermediate C 5 -OO(H) bond at 100  K, thus releasing O 2 in situ, which is trapped above the substrate radical. The <b>dose-dependent</b> <b>rate</b> of bond rupture followed by combined crystallographic and Raman analysis indicates that ionizing radiation kick-starts both peroxide decomposition and its regeneration. Peroxidation can be explained by a mechanism in which the substrate radical recombines with superoxide transiently produced in the active site...|$|E
30|$|Although statins {{have been}} {{reported}} to decrease the production of MMP- 3 from IL- 1 b-stimulated chondrocytes and MMP- 1,- 3,- 9 from macrophages, the mechanism of their inhibitory effects on MMP production in various cells is still controversial. Some studies suggest that statins modulate chondrocyte metabolism by reducing prenylation of key signaling molecules that control expression of collagen-degrading enzymes [25]. Among statin derivates, simvastatin had the advantage of lipophilic properties and the ability to passively diffuse into cells at a <b>dose-dependent</b> <b>rate.</b> The method of statin administration is also an important issue, as various methods such as intraperitoneal and intra-articular administration have been used to investigate its suppressing effect on inflammation in arthritis models [26]. Oral administration—a simple, effective, and more physiologic procedure—avoided the side effects of parenteral use and was favored in this study. Although the effective concentrations used were higher than human therapeutic values for hypercholesterolemia (1.5  mg/kg per day), no reverse effects of simvastatin on cell viability was observed.|$|E

In this study, laminarin (β- 1, 3 -glucan) but not sialic acid, mannan or pustulan mediated Hst 5 binding to C. albicans, and was disassociated by 100 mM NaCl. Time-lapse confocal microscopy revealed a <b>dose-dependent</b> <b>rate</b> of cytosolic uptake of Hst 5 that invariably preceded propidium iodide (PI) entry, demonstrating that translocation itself does not disrupt membrane integrity. Cell toxicity was manifest by vacuolar expansion followed by PI entrance; however, loss of endocytotic vacuolar trafficking of Hst 5 did not reduce killing. Extracellular NaCl (100 mM), but not sorbitol, prevented vacuolar expansion and PI entry in cells already containing cytosolic Hst 5, thus showing a critical role for ionic balance in Hst 5 toxicity. Hst 5 uptake, but not cell wall binding, was blocked by pretreatment with azide or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; however, 10 % of de-energized cells had membrane disruption. Thus, Hst 5 is capable of heterogeneous intracellular entry routes, but only direct cytosolic translocation causes cell death {{as a result of}} ionic efflux...|$|E

40|$|A single {{application}} of 17 μg/kg or 8. 7 mg/kg all-trans- [10, 11 - 3 H 2]-retinoic acid dissolved in acetone to shaved dorsal hamster skin resulted in rapid absorption and <b>dose-dependent</b> <b>rates</b> of elimination. An equation describing a two-compartment open {{model with a}} very brief lag time and first-order uptake and elimination was {{used to describe the}} central plasma compartment kinetics. Unchanged all-trans-retinoic acid represented ≤ 4 % of the total circulating radioactivity. Peak circulating concentrations of parent all-trans-retinoic acid were less than those observed after an equivalent oral dose, but prolonged absorption from the skin appears to contribute to high total bioavailability of topical retinoid. Topical administration to intact skin of up to three consecutive doses of 10. 5 mg/kg/d all-trans-retinoic acid or a single 5 mg/kg dose of etretinate (Ro 10 - 9359) during a critical stage of embryogenesis in hamsters caused erythema and/or dose-dependent epidermal hyperplasia at the site of application, but failed to induce a significant teratogenic response. Topical {{application of}} 0. 01 – 1. 0 mg/kg arotinoid Ro 13 - 6298 resulted in dose-dependent mucocutaneous toxicity and an increase in the numbers of dead embryos and malformed offspring. The marked skin toxicity and attenuated concentrations in maternal blood, compared to the oral route, limit the amounts of retinoid that can reach the hamster embryo. It is thus more important to compare the retinoid systemic values (absorbed dose) than it is to compare the oral or topical (applied) dose, when interpreting the results of conventional teratogenicity bioassays. The data suggest that in the human it is skin toxicity that limits the amounts of retinoid that can be applied and subsequently reach the embryo. In the rodent, overt skin toxicity under continued dosing could increase the amounts of retinoid penetrating the skin and reaching the embryo...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{report the}} case of a patient {{affected}} by gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) who developed cutaneous adverse drug reactions during treatment with imatinib and lansoprazole. Case Summary: After 2 months of treatment with imatinib 400 mg/day, a 60 -year-old white female affected by GIST developed bilateral palpebral edema with hyperemic conjunctivae and labial edema when lansoprazole 15 mg/day was introduced to treat dyspeptic symptomatology. Treatment was discontinued, and on reintroduction of both drugs, the patient developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Two months later, generalized cutaneous reactions appeared immediately following reintroduction of low-dose imatinib with corticosteroid plus lansoprazole treatment. After discontinuation of all drugs, {{with the exception of the}} corticosteroid, the progression of cutaneous lesions stopped. Discussion: The use of imatinib is commonly associated with a high <b>dose-dependent</b> <b>rate</b> of rash and edema. Several cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome have also been described, although not in patients affected by GIST Severe skin reactions have been reported for lansoprazole including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Applying Naranjo's algorithm, the adverse events were considered possible due to imatinib and probable due to lansoprazole. Conclusions: on the basis of the data reported, we conclude that the adverse reactions described may be attributed to either drug alone. However, combined use of drugs may increase the risk of onset of these adverse reactions due to a potential drug interaction involving CYP 3 A 4...|$|E

We simulated emerging disease by exposing tadpoles of the Italian agile frog (Rana latastei), to the North American Ranavirus FV 3. We demonstrated that mortality occurred due to viral exposure, exposure of tadpoles to decreasing concentrations of FV 3 in the laboratory produced <b>dose-dependent</b> survival <b>rates,</b> and cannibalism of virus-carrying carcasses increased mortality due to FV 3.

Data was collected on patients who received 90 [*]mg/m 2 doxorubicin as a continuous infusion and 10 [*]gm/m 2 ifosfamide for up to 6 cycles {{as part of a}} phase II study. Cardiotoxicity was assessed with serial echocardiograms or multigated acquisition scans and serum brain natriuretic peptide and troponin levels.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional, observational, analytical study with retrospective collection that included 65 hospitalized pediatric patients with bloodstream infection by Candida spp. A univariate analysis was performed to estimate the association between {{the characteristics of the}} candidemia patients and death. Results: The incidence of candidemia was 0. 23 cases per 1000 patients/day, with a mortality rate of 32 % (n = 21). Clinical outcomes such as sepsis and septic shock (p = 0. 001), comorbidities such as acute renal insufficiency (p = 0. 01), and risks such as mechanical ventilation (p = 0. 02) and dialysis (p = 0. 03) are associated with increased mortality in pediatric patients.

Methods Hospitalisation was assessed in 1791 patients 3 years after enrolment and related to the WS achieved during a 1 km walk at moderate intensity on a treadmill. Hospitalisation was also assessed during the fourth-to-sixth years as function of improvement in WS in 1111 participants who were re-evaluated 3 years after baseline. Results Three-year hospitalisation rate across tertiles of baseline WS was 50 % for the slow walkers (2. 7 ± 0. 6 km/hour), 41 % for the moderate (4. 1 ± 0. 3 km/ hour) and 25 % for the fast walkers (5. 2 ± 0. 5 km/hour) (p for trend < 0. 0001), with adjusted HRs (95 % CI) of 0. 93 (0. 74 to 1. 17, p= 0. 53) for intermediate and 0. 58 (0. 43 to 0. 78, p= 0. 0003) for fast. Every 1 km/hour increase in WS {{was associated with a}} 21 % reduction in hospitalisation (p< 0. 0001). Hospitalisation from the fourth-to-sixth years was lower across tertiles of improved WS, with 44 % for the low (0. 2 ± 0. 4 km/hour), 34 % for the intermediate (0. 8 ± 0. 2 km/hour) and 30 % for the high tertile (1. 6 ± 0. 4 km/hour) (p for trend < 0. 0001).

Addition of 0. 05 - 5 ng of IL- 1 /ml into the cultures {{resulted in a}} <b>dose-dependent</b> decreased <b>rate</b> of collagen released into the medium over 24 h. To determine whether this inhibition was due to secondary action of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) secreted in response to IL- 1, cultures were incubated in presence of various inhibitors of arachidonate metabolism. Depending on the cell strains, these inhibitors were able to suppress or diminish the effect of IL- 1, suggesting that PGE 2 {{is involved in the}} mechanism. Depression of collagen production caused by IL- 1 mainly affected type I collagen and therefore led to a change in the type I/type III collagen ratio in the extracellular medium. Steady-state levels of mRNA for types I and III procollagens were estimated by dot-blot hybridization and compared with the amounts of respective collagens produced in the same cultures. IL- 1 generally increased procollagen type I mRNA, but to a variable extent, as did indomethacin (Indo). Depending on the cell strain, the combination of indo and IL- 1 could elevate the mRNA level of type I procollagen compared with Indo alone. These results did not correlate with the production rate of collagen in the medium, which was diminished by exposure to IL- 1. The level of mRNA for collagen type III was not greatly changed by incubation with IL- 1, and a better correlation was generally observed with the amount of type III collagen found in the medium. These data suggest that an additional control mechanism at translational or post-translational level must exist, counterbalancing the stimulatory effect of IL- 1 on collagen mRNA transcription. It is likely that IL- 1 could modulate the production of collagen in synovial cells by an interplay of different mechanisms, some of them limiting the effect of primary elevation of the steady-state mRNA level...|$|R

40|$|Amoxicillin was {{studied in}} normal {{subjects}} after intravenous, oral, and intramuscular administration of 250 -, 500 -, and 1, 000 -mg doses. Serum drug levels {{were analyzed using}} a two-compartment open model, as well as area under the curve (AUC) and urinary recovery. The variations of these pharmacokinetic parameters were then examined using the three-way analysis of variance and linear regression equations. These results confirmed nearly complete oral absorption: AUC was 93 % of intravenous absorption, and urinary recovery was 86 %. The intramuscular administration of amoxicillin results in complete and reliable absorption with peak drug levels, AUCs, and urinary recovery equivalent to oral dosage. The absorption of lyophilized amoxicillin after intramuscular injection resulted in an AUC that was 92 % of intravenous absorption and urinary recovery of 91 %. The peak serum levels, time to peak, and other pharmacokinetic parameters for intramuscular injection were nearly identical to those for oral administration. Kinetics of both intramuscular and oral administration exhibited <b>dose-dependent</b> absorption (absorption <b>rate</b> constant, 1. 3 /h for 250 mg and 0. 7 /h for 1, 000 mg). This resulted in relatively later and lower peak serum levels for increasing dose. Total absorption, however, showed no dose dependence, as indicated by urinary recovery and AUC, which changed by less than 10 %...|$|R
40|$|Victims {{of major}} {{electrical}} trauma frequently suffer extensive skeletal muscle and nerve damage, which is postulated to be principally mediated by electroporation and/or thermally driven cell membrane permeabilization. We {{have investigated the}} efficacy of two blood-compatible chemical surfactants for sealing electroporated muscle membranes. In studies using cultured skeletal muscle cells, poloxamer 188 (P 188; an 8. 4 -kDa nonionic surfactant) blocks, and neutral dextran (10. 1 kDa) substantially retards, carboxyfluorescein release from electropermeabilized cell membranes. To test whether P 188 administered intravenously could have the same therapeutic effect in vivo, the rat biceps femoris muscle flap attached by its arteriovenous pedicle was electropermeabilized until its electrical resistivity dropped to 50 % of the initial value. P 188 (460 mg/kg) administered intravenously 20 min postshock restored the resistivity to 77 % of the initial value. When P 188 was administered intravenously 5 min before shock, a <b>dose-dependent</b> impedance recovery <b>rate</b> was observed. Neither neutral dextran (460 mg/kg) nor sterile saline was effective. Histopathologic studies indicated that postshock poloxamer administration reduced tissue inflammation and damage in comparison with dextran-treated or control tissues. Electrophysiologic evidence of membrane damage was not observed in flaps of animals pretreated with poloxamer. These results suggest {{that it may be}} possible to seal in vivo tissue membranes injured by electrical, thermal, or other membrane-damaging forces...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Candida krusei causes {{approximately}} 1 % of {{vulvovaginal candidiasis}} (VVC) cases and is naturally resistant to fluconazole. Antifungal testing {{may be required}} if C. krusei vaginitis fails to respond to non-fluconazole therapy, particularly in patients with recurrent infections. Design. We investigated the clinical characteristics and antifungal susceptibility profile of vaginal C. krusei isolates. Between 2009 and 2012, we identified 560 unrelated Candida spp. -positive vaginal cultures, of which 28 (5. 0 %) were C. krusei. These isolates were analyzed according to host factors and the clinical forms of VVC, and their in vitro susceptibility to 10 antifungal agents was tested using a reference microdilution method. Results. We observed that perineal laceration and increased age (> 50 years) were significant predictors of C. krusei in vaginal samples (P< 0. 05). All isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, caspofungin, ketoconazole, and miconazole. Additionally, susceptible <b>dose-dependent</b> and resistant <b>rates</b> were found for fluconazole as 42. 9 % and 57. 1 %, respectively. Remarkably, only 42. 9 % and 67. 9 % of the isolates were susceptible to itraconazole and voriconazole, respectively. Conclusions. Understanding local susceptibility patterns, especially those of non-C. albicans Candida species, can significantly aid {{in the selection of}} an effective antifungal agent. The in vivo response of C. krusei vaginitis to various antifungal therapeutics remains unknown and requires further research...|$|R
40|$|Asenapine tablets {{are a new}} {{option for}} the {{treatment}} of schizophrenia. Sublingual administration is essential because bioavailability if ingested is less than 2 %. Efficacy is supported by acute and long-term randomized controlled studies conducted by the manufacturer, with asenapine 5 mg twice daily evidencing superiority over placebo in six-week studies of acute schizophrenia, and flexibly-dosed asenapine (modal dose 10 mg twice daily) superior to placebo in a 26 -week maintenance of response study. Tolerability advantages over some second-generation antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, include a relatively favorable weight and metabolic profile, as demonstrated in a 52 -week randomized, head-to-head, double-blind clinical trial. Although dose-related extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia can be present, the frequency of these effects is lower than that for haloperidol and risperidone. Somnolence may also occur, and appears to be somewhat <b>dose-dependent</b> when examining <b>rates</b> of this among patients receiving asenapine for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Prolactin elevation can occur, but at a rate lower than that observed for haloperidol or risperidone. Unique to asenapine is the possibility of oral hypoesthesia, occurring in about 5 % of participants in the clinical trials.

40|$|Background—Among {{retroviral}} vectors, lentiviral vectors {{are unique}} in that they transduce genes into both dividing and nondividing cells. However, their ability to provide sustained myocardial transgene expression has not been evaluated. Methods and Results—Multiply attenuated, self-inactivating lentivectors based on human immunodeficiency virus- 1 contained the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene under the transcriptional control of either the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early enhancer/promoter, the elongation factor- 1 (EF- 1) promoter, or the phosphoglycerate-kinase (PGK) promoter. Lentivectors transduced adult rat cardiomyocytes in a <b>dose-dependent</b> manner (transduction <b>rates,</b> 90 %; multiplicity of infection, 5). The CMV promoter achieved higher EGFP expression levels than the EF- 1 and PGK promoters. Insertion of the central polypurine tract pol sequence improved gene transfer efficiency by 2 -fold. In vivo gene transfer kinetics was studied by measuring the copy number of integrated lentivirus DNA and EGFP concentrations in cardiac extracts by real-time polymerase chain reaction and ELISA, respectively. With CMV promoter-containing lentivectors, vector DNA peaked at day 3, declined by 4 -fold at day 14, but then remained stable up to week 10. Similarly, EGFP expression peaked at day 7, decreased by 7 -fold at day 14, but was essentially stable thereafter. In contrast, vector DNA and EGFP expression declined rapidly with EF- 1 promoter– containing lentivectors. Peak EGFP expression with titer-matched adenovectors was 35 % higher than with CMV lentivectors but was lost rapidly over time...|$|R
40|$|Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) {{expresses a}} 64 -kDa GroEL protein {{belonging}} to the heat shock family of proteins. This protein {{has been shown to}} influence human host cells, but the apoptotic capacity of the GroEL protein regarding T cells is not yet known. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the ability of A. actinomycetemcomitans GroEL (AaGroEL) protein to induce human peripheral blood T-cell apoptosis. Endogenous, purified AaGroEL protein was used as an antigen. In AaGroEL-treated T cells, the data indicated that phosphatidylserine exposure, an early apoptotic event, was dose- and time-dependent. The AaGroEL-treated T cells were also positive for active caspase- 3 in a <b>dose-dependent</b> manner. The <b>rate</b> of AaGroEL-induced apoptosis was suppressed by the addition of the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Furthermore, cleaved caspase- 8 bands (40 / 36 kDa and 23 kDa) were identified in cells responding to AaGroEL. DNA fragmentation was also detected in the AaGroEL-treated T cells. Overall, we demonstrated that the endogenous GroEL from A. actinomycetemcomitans has the capacity to induce T-cell apoptosis. © 2016 Nalbant, Kant.

40|$|International Association for Food Protection. Bacteria use quorum sensing (QS) {{systems to}} {{communicate}} with each other and regulate microbial group behavior, such as the secretion of virulence factors, including biofilm formation. In order to explore safe, edible agents, the potential of star anise (SA) as an anti-QS and antibiofilm agent and its possible application in milk safety were investigated. Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and biosensor strain Chromobacterium violaceum were selected as test strains for QS, biofilm, and exopolysaccharide assays. The percent acidities and total plate counts were determined to evaluate the quality of biofilm-inoculated and noninoculated milk. The yield of SA extraction was 25. 90 % 6 0. 2 % (w/w). At sub-MIC, SA extract did not show any effect on bacterial growth. The production of violacein was inhibited by 89 % by SA extract. The extract also inhibited the formation of biofilm by up to 87 % in a <b>dose-dependent</b> manner. Inhibition <b>rates</b> of 70. 45 %, 42. 82 %, and 35. 66 % were found for exopolysaccharide production. The swarming motility of S. aureus was reduced by about 95. 9 % by SA extract. Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis confirmed that the development of biofilm architecture was hampered. It was found that SA extract could delay the spoilage of milk. In the endeavor to avoid drug resistance, pathogenesis, and resistance to biocides while improving food safety and avoiding health hazard issues arising from synthetic chemicals, SA extract could be used as a potential QS and biofilm inhibitor...|$|R

This alternative medical therapy is becoming increasingly popular in the United States, as are other Energy Medicine modalities that purport to influence a universal healing energy. Human brain cells were cultured and exposed to increasing doses of ionizing radiation. Experienced Johrei practitioners directed healing intentionality toward the cells for 30 min {{from a distance of}} 20 cm and the fate of the cells was observed by computerized time-lapse microscopy. Cell death and cell divisions were tallied every 30 min before, during and after Johrei treatment for a total of 22. 5 h. An equal number of control experiments were conducted in which cells were irradiated but did not receive Johrei treatment. Samples were assigned to treatment conditions randomly and data analysis was conducted in a blinded fashion. Radiation exposure decreased the rate of cell division (cell cycle arrest) in a <b>dose-dependent</b> manner. Division <b>rates</b> were estimated for each 30 min and averaged over 8 independent experiments (4 control and 4 with Johrei treatment) for each of 4 doses of X-rays (0, 2, 4 and 8 Gy). Because few cell deaths were observed, pooled data from the entire observation period were used to estimate death rates. Analysis of variance did not reveal any significant differences on division rate or death rate between treatment groups. Only radiation dose was statistically significant. We found no indication that the radiation response of cultured cells is affected by Johrei treatment...|$|R
40|$|Actin {{modulating}} {{proteins that}} bind polyphosphoinositides, such as phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2), can potentially participate in receptor signaling by restructuring the membrane cytoskeleton and modulating second messenger generation through the phosphoinositide cycle. We examined these possibilities by overexpressing CapG, an actin filament end capping, Ca(2 +) - and polyphosphoinositide-binding protein of the gelsolin family. High level transient overexpression decreased actin filament staining {{in the center}} of the cells but not in the cell periphery. Moderate overexpression in clonally selected cell lines did not have a detectible effect on actin filament content or organization. Nevertheless, it promoted a <b>dose-dependent</b> increase in <b>rates</b> of wound healing and chemotaxis. The motile phenotype was similar to that observed with gelsolin overexpression, which in addition to capping, also severs and nucleates actin filaments. CapG overexpressing clones are more responsive to platelet-derived growth factor than control- transfected clones. They form more circular dorsal membrane ruffles, have higher phosphoinositide turnover, inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate generation and Ca 2 + signaling. These responses are consistent with enhanced PLC gamma activity. Direct measurements of PIP 2 mass showed that the CapG effect on PLC gamma was not due primarily to an increase in the PIP 2 substrate concentration. The observed changes in cell motility and membrane signaling are consistent with the hypothesis that PIP(2) -binding actin regulatory proteins modulate phosphoinositide turnover and second messenger generation in vivo. We infer that CapG and related proteins are poised to coordinate membrane signaling with actin filament dynamics following cell stimulation...|$|R
