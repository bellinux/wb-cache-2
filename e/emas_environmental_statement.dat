In the research, the relation between <b>environmental</b> <b>statement</b> level and related company features were analyzed with panel regression model. According to the results of research, the <b>environmental</b> <b>statement</b> level has positive relation with date of foundation and debt level and it has negative relation with size and stock market listing and it is statistically meaningful.

The line of route between London and the West Midlands is described in Volume 2, which has been divided into 26 smaller geographical sections called Community Forum Areas (CFAs) and each area is covered by its own separate report. Volume 3 : route wide effects describes the likely route wide environmental effects of the construction and operation of Phase One of HS 2. Volume 4 : off‐route effects describes the likely significant environmental effects of Phase One of HS 2 expected at locations beyond the route corridor, such as rail stations, rail depots and rail lines. This volume covers areas not included in the community forum area reports in Volume 2. Volume 5 contains technical appendices, including the response to the draft <b>Environmental</b> <b>Statement</b> consultation and the draft Code of Construction Practice, setting out baseline data and other technical information.

On the other hand, we explore why companies desist from participating in EMAS and thereby from publishing <b>environmental</b> <b>statements.</b> For this purpose, we have conducted a telephone survey with those companies in Northrhine – Westfalia, Germany, which have participated in EMAS twice but have dropped out afterwards. In doing so, the survey also intends to explore whether other types of corporate environmental reporting are increasingly employed in place of <b>environmental</b> <b>statements.</b> All in all, the goal of our study is to derive assumptions about future developments of corporate environmental reporting...|$|R
