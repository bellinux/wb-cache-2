40|$|In {{contrast}} to other approaches that provide methodological guidance for ontology engineering, the NeOn Methodology does not prescribe a rigid workflow, but instead it suggests {{a variety of}} pathways for developing ontologies. The nine scenarios proposed in the methodology cover commonly occurring situations, for example, when available ontologies need to be re-engineered, aligned, modularized, localized to support different languages and cultures, and integrated with ontology design patterns and non-ontological resources, such as folksonomies or thesauri. In addition, the NeOn Methodology framework provides (a) a <b>glossary</b> <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> and activities involved {{in the development of}} ontologies, (b) two ontology life cycle models, and (c) a set of methodological guidelines for different processes and activities, which are described (a) functionally, in terms of goals, inputs, outputs, and relevant constraints; (b) procedurally, by means of workflow specifications; and (c) empirically, through a set of illustrative examples...|$|E
40|$|A new {{ontology}} development paradigm has started; {{its emphasis}} {{lies on the}} reuse and possible subsequent reengineering of knowledge resources, on the collaborative and argumentative ontology development, and on the building of ontology networks; this new trend {{is the opposite of}} building new ontologies from scratch. To help ontology developers in this new paradigm, it is important to provide strong methodological support. This thesis presents some contributions to the methodological area of the Ontology Engineering field that we are sure will improve the development and building of ontologies networks, and thus, - It proposes the NeOn <b>Glossary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Processes</b> and Activities, which identifies and defines the processes and activities potentially involved when ontology networks are collaboratively built. - It defines a set of two ontology network life cycle models. - It identifies and describes a collection of nine scenarios for building ontology networks. - It provides some methodological guidelines for performing the ontology requirements specification activity, to obtain the requirements that the ontology should fulfil. - It offers some methodological guidelines for obtaining the ontology network life cycle for a concrete ontology network, as part of scheduling ontology projects. Additionally, the thesis provides the technological support to these guidelines: a tool called gOntt. - It also proposes some methodological guidelines for the reuse of ontological resources at two different levels of granularity: as a whole (general ontologies and domain ontologies) and using ontology statements...|$|E

The glossary contains over 950 terms and acronyms associated with nuclear material control and accounting for safeguards and nonproliferation. This document is organized as follows: English/Russian <b>glossary</b> <b>of</b> terms and acronyms; Russian/English <b>glossary</b> <b>of</b> terms and acronyms; English/Russian <b>glossary</b> <b>of</b> acronyms; and Russian/English <b>glossary</b> <b>of</b> acronyms...|$|R
40|$|Janice Hart was the {{original}} lead on this project. From June 2011 Val Williams has been leading this project. The aim {{of this research is}} to create an ongoing and updatable resource for professional and avocational researchers (such as researchers looking into their own family histories) to locate relevant photographic material. The ‘Directory’ is the first such resource since John Wall’s ‘Directory’ which appeared as a book publication in the 1970 s. The research has consisted of specifying the requirements for an online website that enables fast and functional searching; conducting initial user testing; leading a small team to populate the website with entries containing information about what is held in public access archives and collections in London; devising a means for curators and others to enter information monitored by strict protocols; and with photographic historian Mark-Haworth-Booth, creating a <b>glossary</b> <b>of</b> photographic <b>processes</b> in order to assist those unfamiliar with the history of photography to use the ‘Directory’ in a productive manner. For the numerous archives and collections which {{have not been able to}} download their own files (the Victoria & Albert Museum is an example of an institution which could) data collection was made on the basis of site visits. One of the principal aims of the research has been to give public access to lesser known photographic material as well as important institutional holdings that form part of photography’s internationally acclaimed canon. The ‘Directory’ therefore includes smaller collections such as Morden College Muniments Room as well as the Victoria & Albert Museum, the national collection of the art of photography...|$|R
