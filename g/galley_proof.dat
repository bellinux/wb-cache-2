5|$|The novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk was {{published}} in 1996. Before its publication, a 20th Century Fox book scout sent a <b>galley</b> <b>proof</b> of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof {{as a candidate for}} a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers Lawrence Bender and Art Linson, who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to Laura Ziskin, head of the division Fox 2000, who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to Fight Club from Palahniuk for $10,000.|$|E

500|$|In his {{foreword}} of the novel, John Galsworthy {{called it}} a [...] "delicious book" [...] and a [...] "little masterpiece" [...] that shows a [...] "delicacy of perception and essential truth". He notes that while reading the <b>galley</b> <b>proof</b> of the novel while crossing the English Channel, he, his wife, and his nephew read each page in turn {{over the course of}} three hours in [...] "silent absorption." [...] The New York Times reviewer John Chamberlain praised Salten's [...] "tender, lucid style" [...] that [...] "takes you out of yourself". He felt that Salten captured the essence of each of the creatures as they talked, catching the [...] "rhythm of the different beings who people his forest world" [...] and showed particular [...] "comprehension" [...] in detailing the various stages of Bambi's life. He also considered the English translation [...] "admirably" [...] done. A reviewer for Catholic World praised the approach of the subject, noting that it was [...] "marked by poetry and sympathy [...] charming reminders of German folklore and fairy tale". However, they disliked the [...] "transference of certain human ideals to the animal mind" [...] and the vague references to religious allegory. The Boston Transcript {{called it a}} [...] "sensitive allegory of life". The Saturday Review considered it [...] "beautiful and graceful" [...] piece that showed a rare [...] "individuality". The Times Literary Supplement stated that the novel is a [...] "tale of exceptional charm, though untrustworthy of some of the facts of animal life." [...] Isabel Ely Lord, reviewing the novel for the American Journal of Nursing, called the novel a [...] "delightful animal story" [...] and Salten a [...] "poet" [...] whose [...] "picture of the woods and its people is an unforgettable one." [...] In comparing Bambi to Salten's later work Perri—in which Bambi makes a brief cameo—Louise Long of the Dallas Morning News considered both to be stories that [...] "quietly and completely [...] the heart". Long felt the prose was [...] "poised and mobile and beautiful as poetry" [...] and praises Salten for his ability to give the animals seemingly human speech while not [...] " [...] their essential natures." ...|$|E
