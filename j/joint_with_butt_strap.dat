40|$|The stress {{capacity}} of joints made of modified wood members under loading {{can be affected}} by design of joints and type of adhesive. Hence, these factors were addressed in this study by assessment of {{stress capacity}} variations in corner joints under diagonal applied compressive load induced combined stresses. The <b>joints</b> <b>with</b> mitered and <b>butted</b> design were constructed by application of epoxy and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) adhesives from furfurylated wood samples with two weight percentage gains (WPGs), i. e., 20 % as low level and 60 % as high level. Results indicated that stress capacity in both corner joints was not significantly decreased with increasing polymerization of furfuryl alcohol (FA) in wood. Despite the high compression strength in mitered joint, the induced compression stresses were low in comparison <b>with</b> <b>butted</b> <b>joint.</b> The stress capacity in mitered <b>joint</b> bonded <b>with</b> epoxy adhesive enhanced with increasing the level of furfurylation. This was true for shear stress parallel to grain as well. Generally, it could be concluded that mitered joint made of furfurylated members and bonded with epoxy adhesive would be stronger than other corner joints...|$|R

40|$|Modern acrylic {{adhesives}} {{make possible}} the bonding {{of glass and}} polycarbonate in large sheets of laminated glass using thin adhesive layers. Glass polycarbonate laminates with thin adhesive layers should have good mechanical properties and thus allow for lighter transparent constructions. Asymmetric double <b>butt</b> <b>strap</b> specimens of glass and polycarbonate were manufactured using photobond 53517 adhesive. These were tested at room temperature in laboratory air in zwick Z 10 universal testing machines. Specimens were tensile tested at different strain rates and subjected to creep and low cycle fatigue tests with different hold times. The results show that several mechanisms are active in a fatigue cycle. Damage is mainly {{a function of the}} hold time at maximum stress rather than a cycle by cycle approach. No single stress/time or strain time parameter can explain the results...|$|R
50|$|Wooden planks can be scarfed into a strake by {{suitably}} tapering {{the thickness}} of the adjoining ends. Traditionally, the adjoining faces were coated with mixed white lead and grease, then held together with copper rivets. It was important to not have the plank end as thin as a feather edge and to have the outboard thin edge at the after end of the joint. In later times, after adhesives had been developed by the aircraft industry, the joint might be made with resin glue and no rivets. In heavier carvel work, the joint would be a butt, riveted to a <b>butt</b> <b>strap.</b> Even large clinker vessels had scarfed strakes as in this form of construction; the strakes contribute a significant proportion of the structural strength of the boat as well as keeping it water-tight.|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{composite}} {{components are}} {{being considered for}} a wide variety of demanding applications in aerospace, space exploration, and ground based systems. A number of these applications require robust integration technologies to join dissimilar materials (metalcomposites) into complex structural components. In this study, three types of composites (C-C, C-SiC, and SiC-SiC) were vacuum brazed to commercially pure Ti using the active metal braze alloy Cusil-ABA (63 Ag- 35. 3 Cu- 1. 75 Ti). Composite substrates with as fabricated and polished surfaces were used for brazing. The microstructure and composition of the joint, examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), showed sound metallurgical bonding in all systems. The <b>butt</b> <b>strap</b> tensile (BST) test was performed on bonded specimens at room and elevated temperatures. Effect of substrate composition, interlaminar properties, and surface roughness on the mechanical properties and failure behavior of joints will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{adhesive}} as {{a structural}} fastener is progressively {{taking place in}} shipbuilding. However, a series of issues needs {{to be looked at}} such as ageing and influence of the tolerance in the adhesive application in order to enhance the knowledge of this technology and reinforce its use in this industry. This paper hence presents the work carried out on <b>butt</b> <b>strap</b> adhesive joints bonding metallic adherends. The influence of adhesive thickness under different ageing conditions on the performance of the joints was investigated. Finite element analysis was carried out to model the joint behaviour taking into account geometric non-linear effects to explain the mechanisms leading to failure. Different failure modes were identified, depending on the level of adhesive thickness. The finite element analysis confirms experimental observations that failure initiated at the horizontal adhesive free surface. Accelerated ageing of the joints suggests interfacial degradation at the steel interface {{at the edges of the}} joint overlap...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{analysis}} of the stresses and strains in a glass fibre polymer composite double <b>butt</b> <b>strap</b> joint using digital image correlation (DIC) is described in the paper. Initially the strain fields through {{the thickness of the}} joint are derived from DIC measurements, capturing the effect of the initiation and development of cracks in the joint up to failure. It is demonstrated that the relatively small strains developed in the through-thickness direction are critical in the development of damage in the joint at the geometric discontinuity between the adherends. An experimental methodology is established to perform DIC at the mesoscopic scale, enabling accurate, high spatial resolution {{analysis of}} the small through-thickness strains around the discontinuity. The DIC enables the strains to be evaluated, their development monitored and hence establish their contribution to the failure process. To determine the full-field stresses in the joint experimentally derived materials properties are used. From component stress maps principal stresses maps are derived, which clearly show where the damage is initiating and its subsequent growth in the composite adherends until final failure of the joint...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{degradation}} and failure of protective coatings (paints and sealants) {{is a key}} element influencing the service life of aircraft. Such degradation is influenced by the response of coatings to environmental factors such as high temperatures and exposure to ultraviolet radiation, as well as chemical factors. However, the effect of loading and load history on coating durability has received little attention, despite clearly being a factor in determining failure sites (such as joints) and the rate of degradation. This paper describes the key characteristics of coatings at aircraft joints, {{and the nature of the}} strains experienced by coatings in locations influenced by in-service loads. It is first step in assessing the complex strain history at joint strain concentration locations as part of developing a prognostic capability for the service life of aircraft coatings. The configuration of coating layers at different joints is important and this research has considered a simplification of a <b>butt</b> <b>strap</b> joint from a RAAF military aircraft and a generic lap joint; predictions of critical movements/displacements have been made using finite element analysis; the predictions will be tested later as part of an experimental program associated with a full-scale fatigue test...|$|R
