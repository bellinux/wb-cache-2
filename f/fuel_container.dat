25|$|Bryant {{drove up}} to the toll booth, where there were several vehicles, and blocked a BMW owned by Mary Rose Nixon. Inside were Nixon, driver Russell James Pollard and {{passengers}} Helene and Robert Graham Salzmann. An argument with Robert Salzmann ensued, and Bryant took out the FAL and shot Salzmann at point-blank range, killing him. Pollard emerged from the BMW and went towards Bryant, who shot him in the chest, killing him. More cars then arrived, but seeing this, the drivers were quickly able to reverse back up the road. Bryant then moved to the BMW and pulled Nixon and Helene Salzmann from the car and shot them dead, dragging their bodies onto the road. Bryant transferred ammunition, handcuffs, the AR-15 rifle and a <b>fuel</b> <b>container</b> to the BMW. Mary Nixon, Russell Pollard, Helene Salzmann and Robert Salzmann are the people Bryant was charged with killing at the toll booth.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to man-portable units, the Germans designed heavy flamethrowers {{before and during}} the First World War.

5000|$|The Germans {{introduced}} a small flamethrower in 1917 {{to replace the}} earlier Kleif. The Wechselapparat ("Wex") had a doughnut-shaped backpack <b>fuel</b> <b>container</b> with a spherical propellant container in the middle. This design was updated during the Second World War to become flamethrower model 40. However, model 40 was considered too fragile so it was soon replaced by the model 41, a simpler construction with smaller, horizontal, cylindrical backpack containers.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} a failure criterion {{that has been}} developed for use in evaluating <b>fuel</b> <b>containers</b> at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) for accidental drop events. The criterion would typically be used in dynamic finite element analyses using the ABA-QUS/Explicit program. The failure criterion {{used in the past}} is generally considered to substantially underestimate the strength and ductility of the materials involved. The new criterion is intended to be more realistic, allowing for more accurate impact analyses. The criterion is based on the distortion energy theory, which is considered to be appropriate for the ductile materials typically used in <b>fuel</b> <b>containers.</b> Also addressed in development of the criterion were the effects of strain rate and hydrostatic stress. The importance of these factors, however, is highly dependent on the material used. Three materials specifically addressed in this study were stainless steel, aluminum, and lead. The criterion is presented in the form of guidelines and recommendations that are based on material data obtained from the literature. The most significant difference between these and the previous criterion is that ductile materials are allowed to strain to much higher levels before they are considered to fail...|$|R

50|$|The flame fougasse has {{remained}} in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient.
