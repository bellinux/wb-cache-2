5|$|Ancient weather {{forecasting}} methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition.

However, {{not all of these}} predictions prove reliable, and many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing.|$|E
5|$|By 1778 Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele stated firmly that molybdena was (indeed) neither galena nor graphite.

Peter Jacob Hjelm successfully isolated molybdenum using carbon and linseed oil in 1781.|$|E

5|$|From Russia, with Love is {{the fifth}} novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond.

Come, Tavy: don't look so bewildered: <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> me: <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> Ramsden; just as <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> anybody.

In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the USA's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War, but that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country.|$|E
