5|$|After Fleming's death a {{continuation}} novel, Colonel Sun, {{was written by}} Kingsley Amis (as Robert Markham) and published in 1968. Amis had already written a literary study of Fleming's Bond novels in his 1965 work The <b>James</b> <b>Bond</b> Dossier. Although novelizations {{of two of the}} Eon Productions Bond films appeared in print, <b>James</b> <b>Bond,</b> The Spy Who Loved Me and <b>James</b> <b>Bond</b> and Moonraker, both written by screenwriter Christopher Wood, the series of novels did not continue until the 1980s. In 1981 the thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with Licence Renewed. Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote – Licence to Kill and GoldenEye – were novelizations of Eon Productions films of the same name. Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s, although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. In 1996 Gardner retired from writing <b>James</b> <b>Bond</b> books due to ill health.|$|E
