25|$|The human {{interface}} guidelines published by Apple for macOS {{are followed by}} many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts. In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system OpenGL composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware-accelerated drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called Quartz Extreme, a component of Quartz. Quartz's internal imaging model correlates well with the Portable Document Format (PDF) imaging model, {{making it easy to}} output PDF to multiple devices. As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features. Reflecting its popularity with design users, macOS also has system support for a variety of professional video and image formats and includes an extensive pre-installed <b>font</b> <b>library,</b> featuring many prominent brand-name designs.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Digital fonts {{have become}} {{ubiquitous}} {{in the age}} of the personal computer. While these fonts have significantly increased the range of typographic expression available to digital documents, they have created a new class of problems. In particular, a document created on one computer system, using digital fonts available on that system, may not display with high fidelity on a second system (even if the computer models and/or operating systems are identical) if the same font files are not available on both systems. While it is possible for the second operating system to map a font request by the viewing application into a request for another font, this replacement font will not in general be a replica of the font used to create the document on the original computer system. In addition, font files require so much storage space that large <b>font</b> <b>libraries</b> are not practical for the vast majority of individuals and organizations. These large font file sizes compound the d...|$|R
50|$|Typekit is {{a service}} which allows {{subscribers}} to embed fonts into online documents. Unlike Edge Web Fonts, Typekit requires a subscription, which {{provides access to}} the <b>font</b> <b>library.</b> The system was initially developed by Small Batch Inc., and purchased by Adobe in October 2011. A free subscription is available to the service, with a more comprehensive option costing an annual fee.|$|E
50|$|Aiki Framework is a {{flexible}} PHP + MYSQL (LAMP) web application framework that allows designers and programmers to easily create {{and work with}} existing content management systems from the web. The Fabricatorz global production company was its commercial steward and has used it to build Open Clip Art Library 3.0 and the now public Open <b>Font</b> <b>Library.</b> Both sites using Aiki Framework were publicly announced at Libre Graphics Meeting 2011.|$|E
50|$|The Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM) is {{an annual}} {{international}} convention for {{the discussion of}} free and open source software used with graphics; The first Libre Graphics Meeting was held in March 2006. Communities from Inkscape, GIMP, Krita, Scribus, sK1, Blender, Open Clip Art Library, Open <b>Font</b> <b>Library,</b> and more come together through the Create Project to assemble this annual conference. It was co-founded by Dave Neary and Dave Odin.|$|E

Only the base classes and substructure were contained in Symbian OS, {{while most of the}} actual user interfaces were maintained by third parties. This is no longer the case. The three major UIs S60, UIQ and MOAP were contributed to Symbian in 2009. Symbian also contains graphics, text layout and <b>font</b> rendering <b>libraries.</b>|$|R

50|$|Open <b>Font</b> <b>Library</b> is {{a project}} devoted to hosting and {{encouraging}} the creation of fonts released under Free Licenses.

Originally created as an initiative in 2006, the project relaunched on May 12, 2011 at the Libre Graphics Meeting 2011 in Montreal by Fabricatorz developer Christopher Adams.|$|E

50|$|Scantext Bodytypes were scanned with a {{video camera}} at a typical {{resolution}} of 512 lines. It is worth noting that, although font editing was pixel-based, character outlines were vectorized in software, thus allowing continuous scaling of any character up to 72 point / 18 mm cap height. For headline setting, Scangraphic introduced a separate range of headline fonts (marketed as Supertypes) with very tight spacing (as was the style at the time). The digital outlines of these fonts were originated by the digital type foundry URW in Ikarus Format and tailored by the Scangraphic type studio. The Supertype font format itself used short vectors (multiple edit points, a legacy of Ikarus encoding, {{as opposed to the}} more minimal PostScript vectorization technique). These fonts could be scaled up to a capital height of 90 mm. By 1991 Scangraphic had released its Supertype <b>font</b> <b>library</b> in Adobe’s PostScript Type1 font format for the Apple Macintosh. This range of designs is still available today.|$|E

5000|$|Xetec's {{best selling}} product is its line of printer interfaces, {{which allows the}} use of many models of non-Commodore parallel-interface {{printers}} with Commodore computers. Some of the popular printers of that era that are supported include Canon, C-Itoh, Star Micronix, Epson, NEC, Okidata, and Panasonic. Early interface models (such as the [...] "Serial Printer Interface" [...] and [...] "Graphics Printer Interface") simply convert from Commodore's serial format to the more standard Centronics parallel interface, with only minimal ASCII conversions and graphic character printing. The Super Graphix Jr adds support for 50+ printers and [...] "Near Letter Quality", which is a technique of using multi-pass graphic printing to achieve higher quality text printing. The more sophisticated Super Graphix also adds an 8K data buffer, screen dump support, two user-loadable <b>fonts</b> (from a <b>library</b> of <b>fonts</b> on the included disk), and a font creation program. The Super Graphix Gold adds a 32K buffer, 4 fixed and 4 user-loadable <b>fonts</b> (from a <b>library</b> of <b>fonts</b> on disk), 10 font printing effects, picture printing, built-in screen dump programs, fast-serial support, and the rather unusual ability to interface a printer directly to a disk drive (for printing pictures and loading fonts directly from disk).|$|R

The library now consists of over different 700 font families.|$|R
