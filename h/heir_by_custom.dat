25|$|In 1856, Vibhaji's son, Kalubha, was born, {{becoming}} heir to Vibhaji's throne. However, as Kalubha grew, {{he established}} a reputation for violence and terror. Among his actions were an attempt to poison his father and a multiple rape. Consequently, Vibhaji disinherited his son in 1877 and, having no other suitable <b>heir,</b> followed <b>custom</b> <b>by</b> adopting an <b>heir</b> from another branch of his family, that of Jhalamsinhji. The first selected heir died within six months of being adopted, either through fever or poisoning on the orders of Kalubha's mother. The second choice, in October 1878, was Ranjitsinhji. Vibhaji took him to Rajkot to secure {{the approval of the}} ruling British and the young boy lived there for the next 18 months before joining the Rajkumar College, supported through this time by an allowance from Vibhaji. Being discouraged by the ambition of Ranjitsinhji's family and the conduct of Jiwansinhji, Vibhaji never completed the adoption of Ranjitsinhji and continued trying to produce his own heir. The prospect of Ranjitsinhji's accession seemed to vanish in August 1882 when one of the women of Vibhaji's court gave birth to a son, Jaswantsinhji.|$|R
