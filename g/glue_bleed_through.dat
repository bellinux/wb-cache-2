40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the risk factors}} for <b>glue</b> extrusion <b>bleeding</b> after endoscopic tissue adhesive injection {{for the treatment of}} esophagogastric variceal bleeding. Methods A total of 416 patients with liver cirrhosis complicated by esophagogastric variceal bleeding or a past history of bleeding who were admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, from October 2008 to January 2016 were enrolled. A retrospective analysis was performed for their clinical data, including sex, age, etiology, routine blood test results, hepatic and renal function, electrolytes, blood lipids, coagulation, diameter of the portal vein, anteroposterior diameter of the spleen, Child-Pugh score, and volume of tissue adhesive injection. The t-test was used for comparison of continuous data between groups, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed. Results Of all patients, 59 experienced <b>glue</b> extrusion <b>bleeding,</b> resulting in an incidence rate of 14. 18 %. The univariate analysis showed that there were significant differences in total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total bile acid, Child-Pugh score, and volume of tissue adhesive injection between the patients with <b>glue</b> extrusion <b>bleeding</b> and those without (t= 2. 54, 2. 85, 2. 35, 1. 03, and 4. 38, all P＜ 0. 05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that Child-Pugh score (odds ratio ［OR］= 2. 714, 95 % confidence interval ［CI］ 1. 600 - 4. 850, P= 0. 009) and volume of tissue adhesive injection (OR= 2. 925, 95 % CI 1. 762 - 5. 124, P= 0. 008) were independent risk factors for <b>glue</b> extrusion <b>bleeding.</b> Conclusion Patients with higher Child-Pugh score and volume of tissue adhesive injection tend to have a higher risk of <b>glue</b> extrusion <b>bleeding...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In 2007, <b>Bleeding</b> <b>Through</b> {{suggested}} to Trustkill {{that they would}} like to release a reissue of their 2006 release The Truth but the idea was rejected for various reasons. In 2008, Trustkill reissued The Truth with bonus tracks and a bonus DVD of which the band had no knowledge of. <b>Bleeding</b> <b>Through</b> believes that the reissue is a [...] "fast and overt attempt to pay some bills." [...] <b>Bleeding</b> <b>Through</b> also had issues with Trustkill and their new album Declaration. Trustkill violated the band's contract by letting them enter the studio in March 2008 and only funding less than 25% of the recording costs; the rest was paid via loans from the lead singer's father and the band's management. <b>Bleeding</b> <b>Through</b> commented on the current state of the label, [...] "Trustkill no longer employs his sales guy, his art director or his publicist. 'Trustkill' is now Josh and one employee in his basement, as far as we can tell." ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Bleeding</b> <b>Through's</b> left-handed {{guitar player}} Brian [...] "Lefty" [...] Leppke joined the band in 2001 {{replacing}} Chad Tafolla.

A few years back in Germany he took over vocal duties for Brandan while he was sick, so he could recover and regain his voice.|$|R
