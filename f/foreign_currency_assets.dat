5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>assets.</b> Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E

Investors will be indifferent to the interest rates on deposits in these countries due to the equilibrium resulting from the forward exchange rate.

If these two returns weren't equalized by the use of a forward contract, there would be a potential arbitrage opportunity in which, for example, an investor could borrow currency in the country with the lower interest rate, convert to the foreign currency at today's spot exchange rate, and invest in the foreign country with the higher interest rate.|$|E

50|$|The {{flight from}} {{domestic}} money {{depends on a}} country's institutional factors. The first factor {{is the level of}} development of the domestic financial market. An economy with a well-developed financial market can offer a set of alternative financial instruments denominated in domestic currency, reducing the role of foreign currency as an inflation hedge. The pattern of the currency substitution process also varies across countries with different foreign exchange and capital controls. In a country with strict foreign exchange regulations, the demand for foreign currency will be satisfied in the holding of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>assets</b> abroad and outside the domestic banking system. This demand often puts pressure on the parallel market of foreign currency and on the country's international reserves. Evidence for this pattern is given in the absence of currency substitution during the pre-reform period in most transition economies, because of constricted controls on foreign exchange and the banking system. In contrary, by facilitating the domestic holding of foreign currency, a country might mitigate the shift of assets abroad and strengthen its external reserves in exchange for a currency substitution process. However, the effect of this regulation on the pattern of currency substitution depends on the public's expectations of macroeconomic stability and the sustainability of the foreign exchange regime.|$|E

40|$|The study {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} effects of inflows of private foreign capital on some major macroeconomic variables in India using quarterly data for the period 1993 - 99. The analyses of trends in private foreign capital inflows and some other variables indicate instability. Whereas net inflows of private foreign capital (FINV), <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>assets,</b> wholesale price index, money supply, real and nominal effective exchange rates and exports follow an I(1) process, current account deficit is the only series that follows I(0). Cointegration test confirms the presence of long-run equilibrium relationships between a few pairs of variables. But the dependence of each I(1) variable on FINV invalidates such cointegration except in two cases: cointegration exists between <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>assets</b> and money supply and between nominal effective exchange rate and exports, even after controlling for FINV. The Granger Causality Test shows unidirectional causality from FINV to nominal effective exchange rates- both trade-based and export-based-, which raises concern about the RBI strategy in the foreign exchange market. Finally, instability in the trend of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>assets</b> could be partially explained by the instability in FINV with some lagged effect.
