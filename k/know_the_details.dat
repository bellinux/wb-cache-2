However, CAMS was waiting to see what the FIA did with its proposed international formula for 2.5 and 2.0-litre touring cars.|$|E
25|$|Padmavati, though {{initially}} dejected by her husband's departure, soon {{falls into}} the company of wanton women who suggest that she take on a lover. She agrees, and every night for the next seventy nights, she gets ready to meet him. But she is thwarted in her attempt every single night by the parrot, which adopts the stratagem of telling her a story. The parrot typically expresses approval of its mistress' intention by agreeing {{that the goal of}} life was to seek pleasure and acknowledges the strength of sexual desire. Then it excites her interest by asking whether she had the wits to escape if any troublesome situation were to arise, as the protagonist of her next story had. Padmavati naturally wants to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of the story and the parrot proceeds to narrate it. At the end of the story, Padmavati decides not to go for her rendezvous that night.|$|E
25|$|Elena {{approaches}} Towers' {{security advisor}} Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker), claiming knowledge of an impending attack, {{the details of}} which she will only divulge to Harry Pearce. However, he is scheduled for immediate deportation to the United States. Ruth relays this information to her former team mates at Section D. Section chief Erin Watts (Lara Pulver), case officer Dimitri Levendis (Max Brown) and analyst Calum Reed (Geoffrey Streatfeild) decide to illegally break Harry out of CIA custody and escape to an abandoned Ministry of Defence bunker, where they meet with Ruth, Elena and Sasha. Harry interrogates Elena, who admits she does not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>details,</b> {{but it has been}} planned by her handlers, Russian politicians who view their government is becoming too weak, and that a partnership with the UK would be embarrassing. However Elena does recall a telephone number, leading Dimitri and Erin to an address. There they find a picture of a man in a jammed paper shredder. Elena recognises the man as Pavel Zykov (Andrew Byron), a Russian ultranationalist.|$|E

25|$|Five years later, Reed {{is now a}} PDNY officer, {{working as}} a beat cop {{under the command of}} Lt. Deena Dixon (Mariska Hargitay). However, he has applied for and been {{accepted}} into the Organized Crime Unit run by Chief Victor Navarro (Esai Morales), where he is partnered with Higgins. On Reed's first night, Higgins heads for a meeting at a warehouse, telling Reed he doesn't need to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>details.</b> Moments after Higgins enters the building, it explodes, killing Higgins. In the aftermath, Navarro returns Reed to Dixon's command. She tells him he can keep his recently earned promotion and work plainclothes, but is not to investigate Higgins' death, as Navarro wants the investigation to remain internal to OCU. Shortly thereafter, Reed is contacted by FBI Special Agent Gabriel Whitting (Christopher Walken), who informs him there is a mole in the OCU. Whitting believes Higgins was about to reveal the identity of the mole, which is why he was killed. Prior to his death, Higgins told Whitting to bring Reed into the investigation should anything happen. All Whitting knows about the mole is that they are in contact with four major crime organizations in Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|By 2012, the Cázares {{claimed the}} Tamaulipas agency had not {{questioned}} potential suspects or eyewitnesses of the kidnapping, nor had they visited the locations {{relevant to the}} case. The Cázares have insisted that authorities should start by investigating the house they were taken following their kidnapping, given that it is located just {{a block away from}} a busy street in Matamoros. In March 2012, an electricity bill was found {{on the door of the}} premises. The bill showed that the service was used exponentially during the month the family was kidnapped, and that the last time someone paid the bill was on January 2011. A neighbor who lived near the house where the Cázares were held hostage said he did not know who the owners of the property were but did acknowledge seeing suspicious activity during the evenings. On March 7, about 10 months after the mass kidnapping, Gérald Martin, the General Consul of France in Mexico, told the Cázares family that a squadron of Mexico's Federal Police had been dispatched to Matamoros to work directly on the case. The family claims, however, that were not sure if the investigation was actually carried out. They said they did not receive any documents of the investigation. By October 2012, a criminal court in Jalisco under judge Francisco Martín Hernández Zaragoza was assigned to investigate the case. The family claims they do not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of the investigation.|$|E

However, he later visits a retired spycatcher Bernard Qualtrough (Richard Johnson) believing there is high level mole within MI5.

Harper also stated that he had told the Conservative party representatives that they were unlikely to succeed. [...] "I told them they were wasting their time. I said Chuck had made up his mind." [...] In February 2008, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigated the allegations that Section 119's provisions on bribery and corruption in the Criminal Code had been violated.

500|$|French {{ambassador}} Stanislas Ostroróg {{was involved}} in returning {{the remains of the}} Irish poet from France to Ireland in 1948; {{in a letter to the}} European director of the Foreign Ministry in Paris [...] "Ostrorog tells how Yeats’s son Michael sought official help in locating the poet’s remains. [...] Neither Michael Yeats nor Sean MacBride, the Irish foreign minister who organised the ceremony, wanted to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of how the remains were collected, Ostrorog notes. [...] He repeatedly urges caution and discretion and says the Irish ambassador in Paris should not be informed." [...] Yeats' body was exhumed in 1946 and the remains were moved to on ossuary and mixed with other remains. The French Foreign Ministry authorized Ostrorog to secretly cover the cost of repatriation from his slush fund. Authorities were worried about the fact that the much-loved poet's remains were thrown into a communal grave, causing embarrassment for both Ireland and France. [...] "Mr Rebouillat, (a) forensic doctor in Roquebrune would be able to reconstitute a skeleton presenting all the characteristics of the deceased."

2500|$|On December 9, 2007, {{the jury}} {{returned}} a verdict that Pickton is not guilty on six counts of first-degree murder, but is guilty on six counts of second-degree murder. A second-degree murder conviction carries a punishment {{of a life}} sentence, with no possibility of parole for a period between 10 and 25 years, to be set by the trial judge. On December 11, 2007, after reading 18 victim impact statements, British Columbia Supreme Court Judge Justice James Williams sentenced Pickton to life with no possibility of parole for 25 years– the maximum punishment for second-degree murder– and equal to the sentence {{which would have been}} imposed for a first-degree murder conviction. [...] "Mr. Pickton's conduct was murderous and repeatedly so.

2500|$|The next day, {{a team of}} FBI {{agents and}} Justice {{prosecutors}} investigating the leak questioned the deputy secretary. Armitage acknowledged that he had passed along to Novak information contained in a classified State Department memo: that Wilson's wife worked on weapons-of-mass-destruction issues at the CIA... felt obligated to inform White House counsel Alberto Gonzales. But Powell and his aides feared the White House would then leak that Armitage had been Novak's source – possibly to embarrass State Department officials who had been unenthusiastic about Bush's Iraq policy. So Taft told Gonzales the bare minimum: that the State Department had passed some information about the case to Justice. He didn't mention Armitage. Taft asked if Gonzales wanted to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>details.</b> The president's lawyer, playing the case by the book, said no, and Taft told him nothing more. Armitage's role thus remained that rarest of Washington phenomena: a hot secret that never leaked.|$|E
2500|$|... 'What is necessary', writes Gleizes, 'is to take {{everything}} up {{again from the}} foundations and to start out from the unquestionable reality of two currents which, unaware of each other, were finally enfolded under a single heading, the movement that was called 'Cubism'.
