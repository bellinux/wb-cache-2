40|$|The future European radio {{navigation}} system Galileo will use its own timescale for the synchronization and dissemination of the predicted satellite clocks.

For timing applications, both the GPS and Galileo systems broadcast as well the difference between their respective system times (GPST and GST) and the universal timescale (UTC), with a maximum deviation requirement of the order of 1 microsecond for GPS (although in practice the deviation is currently below 10 nanoseconds) and 50 nanoseconds for Galileo.

GPS/Galileo inter-system bias and drift are evaluated here using different types of receivers: two mass market and two professional receivers. Moreover, three different approaches are considered for the inter-system bias determination: in the first one, the broadcast Galileo to GPS time offset is used to align GPS and <b>Galileo</b> <b>time</b> scales. In the second, the inter-system bias {{is included in the}} multi-constellation navigation solution and is estimated using the measurements available.

The impact of the inter-system bias on the position velocity time solution is also considered and the performance of the approaches analysed is evaluated in terms of standard deviation and mean errors for both horizontal and vertical components. From the experiments, it emerges that the inter-system bias is very stable and that the use of constraints, modelling the GPS/Galileo inter-system bias behaviour, significantly improves the performance of multi-constellation navigation.

40|$|Looking {{forward for}} {{the advent of the}} future European {{navigation}} system Galileo, we anticipate a big part of its potential users to utilize combined GPS/Galileo receivers. It will allow such users to get benefits of observing two satellite constellations (= more satellites in view), and utilizing services of two independent navigation systems (= more reliability). The combined use of GPS and Galileo requires the systems to be interoperable. Already on {{the early stages of the}} Galileo program, interoperability with GPS was set as a goal for Galileo design and implementation. Leaving aside such issues like signal design, frequency allocation, signal processing etc, we concentrate here on the timing aspects of the interoperability. Like GPS today, Galileo will establish an independent timescale - Galileo System Time (GST) - which will serve as a basis for system operation and computation of satellite orbits and clock parameters. Both GPS Time and GST will be steered to the International Atomic Time (TAI). Their residual offsets to TAI will be available to users in the navigation messages. However, due to uncertainties of the TAI offset determination and of the steering, the accuracy with which the offset between GPS Time and GST will be known to users is expected to be in order of 10 ns. This uncertainty will cause a slowly changing bias between GPS and Galileo measurements in a combined navigation solution. The first part of the paper is dedicated to an estimation of the magnitude of the bias and its impact on the accuracy of user positioning which is taken as a function of the geometry of GPS and Galileo constellations (Dilution of Precision), equivalent user range error (UERE), and the uncertainty of the GPS <b>Galileo</b> <b>time</b> offset. With these three parameters we simulate the accuracy of the combined positioning solution for a world-wide grid, and empirically assess its dependence on the GPS <b>Galileo</b> <b>time</b> offset. The simulation allows us to obtain the upper limit for this offset at which its impact on the user positioning accuracy is below a selected significance level. The current Galileo baseline foresees the determination of the GPS <b>Galileo</b> <b>time</b> offset (GGTO) on system level and its dissemination to users in the Galileo navigation message. In the second section of the paper we discuss two options for the GGTO determination, namely: a) using a combined GPS/Galileo receiver, and b) using a GPS time receiver connected to the physical realisation of GST as generated at the Galileo Precise Time Facility (PTF). First, we assess the limits for accuracy of the GGTO determination set by the stability of GPS Time and GST, and propose a model which can be used to simulate the dynamic behaviour of GGTO. Then we study GGTO determination accuracy for both of the options listed above using simulated GPS and Galileo observations and the GGTO model we obtained. The simulations were made considering the accuracy of both today´s and modernized GPS. Finally, we check the simulation results by processing GPS measurements collected in the time laboratories of German Aerospace Center (DLR) and of the Royal Observatory of Belgium. In both processing tests, the timescale of the laboratory that hosts GPS receiver is assumed to represent GST. GPS data are processed with three types of satellite ephemeris - broadcast ephemeris, precise ephemeris computed by IGS, and broadcast ephemeris with correction from EGNOS (simulated) - to identify a candidate scenario for the operational implementation. Finally, we study the scenario where GGTO is determined in the user receiver as an additional unknown in the navigation solution. We simulate GPS and Galileo observations both for users with an unobstructed sky view and for users in a typical urban environment where the number of satellites is limited because of obstructions inherent to "cityscape". We simulate urban environments making use of known statistical models of cities implemented in DLR´s simulation software. These simulations allow to compare the two GGTO determination scenarios - on system level (broadcast of GGTO in the navigation message), and on user level (GGTO determination in user receiver) - in terms of user position accuracy and availability of the navigation service for the two types of users introduced above...|$|E

The relationship between TGDs and DCBs for multi-GNSS is clearly figured out, and the equivalence of TGD and DCB correction models combining theory with practice is demonstrated. Meanwhile, the TGD/DCB correction models have been extended to various standard point positioning (SPP) and precise point positioning (PPP) scenarios in a multi-GNSS and multi-frequency context. To evaluate the effectiveness and practicability of broadcast TGDs in the navigation message and DCBs provided by the Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX), both single-frequency GNSS ionosphere-corrected SPP and dual-frequency GNSS ionosphere-free SPP/PPP tests are carried out with quad-constellation signals. Furthermore, the author investigates the influence of differential code biases on GNSS positioning estimates. The experiments show that multi-constellation combination SPP performs better after DCB/TGD correction, for example, for GPS-only b 1 -based SPP, the positioning accuracies can be improved by 25. 0 %, 30. 6 % and 26. 7 %, respectively, in the N, E, and U components, after the differential code biases correction, while GPS/GLONASS/BDS b 1 -based SPP can be improved by 16. 1 %, 26. 1 % and 9. 9 %. For GPS/BDS/Galileo the 3 rd frequency based SPP, the positioning accuracies are improved by 2. 0 %, 2. 0 % and 0. 4 %, respectively, in the N, E, and U components, after Galileo satellites DCB correction. The accuracy of Galileo-only b 1 -based SPP are improved about 48. 6 %, 34. 7 % and 40. 6 % with DCB correction, respectively, in the N, E, and U components. The estimates of multi-constellation PPP are subject to different degrees of influence. For multi-constellation combination SPP, the accuracy of single-frequency is slightly better than that of dual-frequency combinations. Dual-frequency combinations are {{more sensitive to the}} differential code biases, especially for the 2 nd and 3 rd frequency combination, such as for GPS/BDS SPP, accuracy improvements of 60. 9 %, 26. 5 % and 58. 8 % in the three coordinate components is achieved after DCB parameters correction. For multi-constellation PPP, the convergence time can be reduced significantly with differential code biases correction.

These clocks on the ground are gathered together within the parallel functioning Precise Timing Facilities in the Fucino and Oberpfaffhofen Galileo Control Centres. The ground based clocks also generate a worldwide <b>time</b> reference called <b>Galileo</b> System <b>Time</b> (GST), the standard for the Galileo system and are routinely compared to the local realizations of UTC, the UTC(k) of the European frequency and time laboratories.|$|R
