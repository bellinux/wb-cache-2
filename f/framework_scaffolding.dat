40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{conceptual}} <b>framework,</b> <b>scaffolding</b> participatory simulation for mobile learning (SPSML), used on mobile devices for helping students learn conceptual {{knowledge in the}} classroom. As the pedagogical design, the framework adopts an experiential learning model, which consists of five sequential but cyclic steps: the initial stage, concrete experience, observation and reflection, abstract conceptualization, and testing in new situations. Goal-based and scaffolding approaches to participatory simulations are integrated into the design to enhance students ’ experiential learning. Using the SPSML framework, students can experience the following: (1) learning in augmented reality by playing different participatory roles in mobile simulations in the micro-world on a mobile device, and (2) interacting {{with people in the}} real world to enhance understanding of conceptual knowledge. An example of the SPSML-based system was implemented and evaluated. The experimental results show that the system was conducive to the students ’ experiential learning and motivation. Moreover, the students who learned with the proposed approach gained significantly higher accuracy rates in performing th...|$|E

Although parallel computing has been {{at the core of the}} performance gains achieved until now, scaling over 1, 000 times the current concurrency can be challenging. As discussed in this paper, even the smallest memory access and synchronization overheads can cause major bottlenecks at this scale. As we develop new software and adapt existing algorithms for exascale, we need to be cognizant of such pitfalls. In this paper, we document our experience with optimizing a fairly common and parallelizable visualization algorithm, threshold of cells based on scalar values, for such highly concurrent architectures. Our experiments help us identify design patterns that can be generalized for other visualization algorithms as well. We discuss our implementation within the Dax toolkit, which is a framework for data analysis and visualization at extreme scale.

40|$|Scaffolding was {{initially}} {{defined as the}} 2 ̆ 2 process that enables a child or novice to solve a problem, carry out a task or achieve a goal which would be beyond his unassisted efforts 2 ̆ 2 (Wood, Bruner, 2 ̆ 6 Ross, 1976, p. 90). Wood et al. (1976) listed the six scaffolding 2 ̆ 2 functions 2 ̆ 2 as: recruitment, reduction in degrees of freedom, direction maintenance, marking critical features, frustration control, and demonstration. In the 38 years since, scaffolding has expanded to many content areas and educational levels (Reiser, 2004). Many researchers have provided additional <b>frameworks</b> for understanding <b>scaffolding.</b> Kali and Linn (2008) organized scaffolding under four 2 ̆ 2 Meta-Principles 2 ̆ 2 and eight 2 ̆ 2 Pragmatic Principles 2 ̆ 2 such as: making thinking visible, promoting autonomous lifelong learning, enable three-dimensional manipulation, and encourage reflection (Kali 2 ̆ 6 Linn, 2008). Quintana et al. (2004) organized a <b>framework</b> of <b>scaffolding</b> functions {{by looking at the}} process of 2 ̆ 2 sense making 2 ̆ 2. While existing <b>scaffolding</b> <b>frameworks</b> (e. g., Authors, 2011; Ge 2 ̆ 6 Land, 2004; Kali 2 ̆ 6 Linn, 2008; Lin et al., 1999; Kim 2 ̆ 6 Hannafin, 2011; Puntambekar 2 ̆ 6 Kolodner, 2005; Reiser, 2004; Quintana et al., 2004), have made important contributions, they do not seamlessly integrate into a single framework. Furthermore, no single framework or conglomeration of multiple frameworks has kept pace with the terms, functions and forms present throughout existing empirical research. This has led some researchers to argue that scaffolding has become too broad (Pea, 2004; Puntambekar 2 ̆ 6 Hubscher, 2005) while others have called for a common theoretical <b>framework</b> from which <b>scaffolding</b> can be understood and evaluated (Quintana et al., 2004). Months into a two-year National Science Foundation (NSF) funded meta-analysis on computer-based scaffolding, it became apparent that existing frameworks (Kali 2 ̆ 6 Linn, 2008; Quintana et. al., 2004; Wood, Bruner, 2 ̆ 6 Ross, 1976) were insufficient to characterize the broad range of scaffolding literature. We thus decided to create a new theoretical model through the grounded theory approach. The purpose of this research is to develop a single <b>scaffolding</b> <b>framework</b> that (a) includes an inductively defined list of scaffolding forms and functions and (b) covers computer-based scaffolding used in classroom contexts as well as intelligent tutoring systems...|$|R

We also discuss the necessity of adaptive scaffolding and an approach to realize it. The metacognitive process plays a crucial role in enhancing human problem solving capability. The process can be divided into the following two processes: one is a monitoring process where a learner observes his/her action or results of the action, and the other is a reflection process where the learner reconstructs his/her knowledge based on the information collected in the monitoring process. Although the learning is carried out in the reflection process, the monitoring process is also important to motivate the reflection or to provide information for reflection. Scaffolding of the monitoring process is an important issue in computer-based learning environments [Gama 2001]. If a learner only monitors his/her action or results of it, he/she doe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a <b>framework</b> for <b>scaffolding</b> {{conflict}} awareness {{to pull the}} trigger of reflection in a metacognitive process. If a learner only monitors his/her action or results of it, he/she may not reflect them. When a learner finds something strange, the learner is motivated to carry out the reflection. To feel its strangeness, the learner should know the normal situation. Then the learner finds the difference between the observed thing and the normal thing he/she knows. The difference should also be significant for him/her. In short, when a learner is aware of a problem in his/her action or results, he/she motivates to reflect his/her knowledge. We call the awareness "Conflict Awareness". To visualize the difference is a promising approach to scaffolding the conflict awareness. In this paper, we propose Error-Based Simulation (EBS) as a method to visualize the difference targeting erroneous equations in physics problems. Control of the visualization is also described...|$|R
40|$|We {{build on}} {{theoretical}} foundations of tool-mediated learning, tool design, and human computer interaction {{to develop a}} <b>framework</b> for implicit <b>scaffolding</b> in learning environments. Implicit scaffolding employs affordances, constraints, cueing, and feedback in order to frame and scaffold student exploration without explicit guidance, {{and it is a}} particularly useful design framework for interactive simulations in science and mathematics. A key purpose of implicit scaffolding is to support a range of educational goals including affect, process, and content. In particular, the use of implicit scaffolding creates learning environments that are productive for content learning and are able to simultaneously support the affective goals of student agency and ownership over the learning process - goals that may not be addressed in more directed learning environments. We describe how the framework is applied {{in the context of the}} Energy Skate Park: Basics simulation, a simulation aimed at middle school student learning of energy concepts. Interview data provides an exemplar of the process by which implicit scaffolding can support productive student exploration with a computer simulation.

40|$|The {{construction}} of scientific explanations, {{as a key}} scientific practice, has been highlighted in policy documents. However, research suggests that students lack competence in constructing scientific explanations and {{this is due to}} a lack of appropriate scaffolding in science instruction. To address this problem, researchers have developed the Claim-Evidence-Reasoning <b>framework,</b> as <b>scaffolding</b> for constructing scientific explanations. Derived from that framework, a learning progression of scientific explanations has been proposed for the entry point of K- 12 science education. However, a clarification on the theoretical foundation of the Claim-Evidence-Reasoning framework and a further extending of the learning progression of scientific explanation has been called for. Therefore, in this paper we aim to add to this research area by first refining its theoretical foundations. More specifically, through linking perspectives on scientific explanations in philosophy of science and in science education, we develop the Phenomena-Theory-Data-Reasoning framework.

In this section, research projects related to the concept of trust will be used to illustrate how new studies can be built on previous ones and then all studies integrated to develop a comprehensive model without compromising validity. The multiple stages of inquiry will be elucidated using the strategies of deconstruction, development of a skeletal <b>framework,</b> and <b>scaffolding</b> as described by in the opening section by Morse and Mitcham. The strategy of deconstruction was used in the initial project (Morse, 2000), which was a multidisciplinary concept analysis to determine the level of conceptual maturity. Once it was determined that trust was not well developed in the context of health care interactions, literature was used as data (Morse, 2000) to advance the concept further for the purposes of concept clarification. Although this began the process of identifying the structural features of the concept, these data left us with many questions, particularly since the trust literature was context bound and thus not easily applied to health care relationships. A skeletal framework was then developed to investigate trust in health care relationships using grounded theory (Hupcey, Penrod, & Morse, 2000). This project also advanced the concept further toward maturity, but some aspects still remained unclear. For example, risk as a precondition for trust as found during the concept clarification was not necessarily seen when trust was applied to health care relationships. The strategy of scaffolding was then used as data collection continued with other types of participants and in different contexts to clarify discrepancies in the data and verify the developing model of the concept of trust in health care interactions (Hupcey, Clark, Hutcheson, & Thompson, in press; Thompson, Hupcey, & Clark, in press).

This paper aims to bridge the following gaps: first, the need for a proper <b>framework</b> for <b>scaffolding</b> creative writing through learning software; second, the lack of technical scaffolding in creative writing learning software; third, the need for customizable learning software that requires little programming knowledge; and fourth, personalized learning. To develop our initial framework, Merrill's First Principles of Instruction is used as pedagogical scaffold and story setting, characters and story structure as component-based technical scaffolds. These were tested in a low-fidelity prototype. User testing indicates an increase in creativity, improvement in story development, clarity of ideas and language skills. We also derive two design principles, i. e. identity and interactivity. Based on these findings, a high-fidelity prototype, named Storyworld, is developed. T-test analyses on results indicate significant improvement in overall creative writing skills, as well as grammar, structure and creativity. The prototype utilizes component-based design in the technical scaffolds, which is encapsulated in a tidy framework that can be personalized for individual learning needs.

This study applies a transition of regulation <b>framework</b> to <b>scaffolding</b> coding, using a self-regulation and other-regulation coding scheme, to explore how rich and detailed data on mother–child dyadic interactions fit alongside collapsed sample-level scores. Sample. Data of 78 mother–child dyads (M age = 9 years 10 months) from the Sisters and Brothers Study (SIBS: Pike et al., 2006, Family relationships in middle childhood.

Results. These constructs were examined at a sample level, providing general findings about typical patterns of self-regulation and other-regulation. Seven exemplar families at different ends of the spectrum were then extracted for fine-grained examination, showing substantial trial- and behaviour-related differences between seemingly similarly scoring families.

However, manufacturing and design being the front end of manufacturing is still a key economic driver this study is looking at the embryonic initiatives undertaken to build an ecosystem of design and entrepreneurship in a regional area. Several aspects will be looked at, high school and university student engagement in the process, established SME's and start-up culture. With the establishment of an ecosystem it is believed that success will breed success. With student engagement showing that being creative and playing can yield tangible results, it also gets students comfortable with the element of risk. The efforts of Deakin University is about providing the <b>framework</b> and <b>scaffolding</b> for students to pursue a start-up idea and test it validity. The final part of the ecosystem is for SME's and recent start-ups to share their success stories and acting as mentors as future start-ups emerge. By creating an ecosystem that is driven by design, manufacturing and entrepreneurship key economic outcomes will be generated; a regional area will be more resilient to economic uncertainty and ultimately a cohort of innovative thinkers that will generate value for their community...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MEd (Education)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. The {{mathematics}} curriculum {{currently used}} in South African classrooms emphasises problem-solving to develop critical thinking. However, {{based on the}} local performance of South African Foundation Phase learners as well as performance in comparative international studies in mathematics, there is concern regarding their competence when solving mathematical problems and their use of meaningful strategies. This qualitative research study explores how writing can support Grade 3 learners’ mathematical problem-solving abilities. Writing in mathematics is examined {{as a tool to}} support learners when they solve mathematical problems to develop their critical thinking and deepen their conceptual understanding. The study followed a case study design. Social constructivist theory formed the theoretical <b>framework</b> and <b>scaffolding</b> was provided by various types of writing tasks. These writing tasks, specifically those promoted by Burns (1995 a) and Wilcox and Monroe (2011), were modelled to learners and implemented by them while solving mathematical problems. Writing tasks included writing to solve mathematical problems, writing to record (keeping a journal or log), writing to explain, writing about thinking and learning processes and shared writing. Data were gathered through learners’ written work, field notes, audio-recordings of ability group discussions and interviews. Data were analysed to determine the usefulness of Burns’ writing methodology to support learners’ problem-solving strategies in the South African context. The analysis process involved developing initial insights, coding, interpretations and drawing implications to establish whether there was a relation between the use of writing in mathematics and development of learners’ problem-solving strategies. This study revealed an improvement in the strategies and explanations learners used when solving mathematical problems. At the end of the eight week data collection period, a sample of eight learners showed marked improvement in verbal and written explanations of their mathematical problem-solving strategies than before the writing tasks were implemented...|$|R
