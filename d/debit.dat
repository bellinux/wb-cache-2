The EBT <b>debit</b> card system has improved the program’s payment accuracy rate to 96.4% in 2003, 4 years ahead of its 2007 goal of 95% accuracy.|$|E

Direct <b>debits</b> are made under each country's rules, and are usually restricted to domestic transactions in those countries. An exception in this respect is the Single Euro Payments Area which allows for Euro-denominated cross-border (and domestic) direct <b>debits</b> since November 2010.

5|$|During Brown's {{tenure in}} the New York State Senate his Democratic Party {{was in the}} minority. He {{was part of the}} {{majority}} that backed New York Governor George Pataki's 2001 plan to build up to three Western New York casinos on Seneca Indian land. The legislation was controversial because it granted slot machine rights to casino operators {{for the first time in}} New York State. Both of the previous casinos used video gambling machines with <b>debit</b> cards. Brown supported the casinos as a way to support the local economy. When the casino was completed in 2003, he was on the seven-member commission that was to apportion the state's agreed 18% share of the slot machine revenue, amounting to approximately $40million.|$|E
5|$|The A1 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system integrated with the A6 motorway as the two connect in the Bosiljevo2 interchange forming a unified toll system.

The toll is payable in Croatian kuna, euro, major credit and <b>debit</b> cards and using a number of prepaid toll collection systems including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operators and ENC – an electronic toll collection (ETC) which is shared at all motorways in Croatia (except the A2 motorway) and provides drivers use of dedicated lanes at toll plazas and a discounted toll rates.|$|E

5|$|The {{balance of}} {{payments}} accounts summarize payments made to or received from foreign countries. Receipts are considered credit transactions while payments are considered <b>debit</b> transactions.

The current account summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official reserve account, which summarizes central banks' purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves.|$|E

Veronica gets Piz to accept her leaving for the internship. At the Sheriff’s station, Weevil is called out by several students as being the one who gave them the fake cards. Weevil is put in the jail cell, but he tells Veronica that he think they targeted him after he was showcased in the criminology class. She investigates several of {{the owners of the}} student IDs, who do seem genuine in accusing Weevil. Weevil gets bail, but Keith informs him that a student ID printing machine was found in the locker next to Weevil’s. Veronica and Wallace speak to a mechanical engineering professor, who says that it would be impossible for Weevil to be the culprit. Piz invites Keith to appear on his show in an election special before Keith informs Veronica that Weevil’s fingerprints were found all over the investigation.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, 2017, Baker {{proposed}} a $40.5 billion state budget {{for fiscal year}} 2018, and on March 9, 2017, legislative hearings began to review it.
