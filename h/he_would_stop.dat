5|$|In August, twelve {{engineers}} were hired on contract with Baneservice, {{at the time}} a subsidiary of the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The {{engineers were}} subsequently re-certified for the Y1 class, as well as being given a service course. While other engineers in the country are required to take an 18-month course, Timetoget felt it could meet sufficient safety standards with a six-week course. Arne Wam, chief executive officer of NSB, stated that he could not permit that a subsidiary ignore safety in such a way, and announced <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> operations.|$|E
5|$|Living {{alone in}} Mysore, Narayan {{developed}} {{an interest in}} agriculture. He bought an acre of agricultural land and tried his hand at farming. He was also prone to walking to the market every afternoon, {{not so much for}} buying things, but to interact with the people. In a typical afternoon stroll, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> every few steps to greet and converse with shopkeepers and others, most likely gathering material for his next book.|$|E

5|$|On 11 December, Ali messaged the United Nations {{requesting}} a cease-fire, {{but it was}} not authorized by the President Yahya Khan and the fighting continued. Following several discussions and consultations, and subsequent attacks by the Indian forces, Khan decided to stop the war in order to save the lives of Pakistani soldiers. The actual decision to surrender was taken by Niazi on 15 December and was conveyed to Manekshaw through the United States Consul General in Dhaka (then Dacca) via Washington. But Manekshaw replied that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> the war only if the Pakistani troops surrendered to their Indian counterparts by 9:00a.m. on 16 December. Later the deadline was extended to 3:00p.m. of the same day at Niazi's request. The Instrument of Surrender was formally signed on 16 December 1971.|$|E
5|$|Development of D {{lasted about}} {{one year and}} was {{directed}} by WARP president Kenji Eno. Eno was heavily inspired by Polarware's Transylvania adventure game series and he believes D would have never been created {{if it were not}} for playing those games. Eno and WARP were still relatively unknown in the industry, D would be their first major title. With this in mind, Eno felt that he was gambling his development career on D, and if it were not successful <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> developing games. There were three phases to Ds development: the adventure game structure, the story creation, and finally violence was added. Since the adventure gameplay was largely finished before the story began to take fruition, flashbacks were added to detail the plot. The plot was largely based on that of Dracula, but Eno found it too boring, and so added violence and cannibalism to make the game more striking. The FMVs were created using Amiga 4000s.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, {{bilateral relations}} between Thailand and Cambodia became strained due to overlapping claims {{on the land}} area surrounding Preah Vihear Temple. Sihanouk issued a communique in July 2008 emphasizing the Khmer architecture of the temple as well as ICJ's 1962 ruling of the temple in favour of Cambodia. In August 2009 Sihanouk stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> posting messages on his personal website as he was getting old, {{making it difficult for}} him to keep up with his personal duties. Between 2009 and 2011, Sihanouk {{spent most of his time}} in Beijing for medical care. He made a final public appearance in Phnom Penh on his 89th birthday and 20th anniversary of the Paris Peace Accords on 30October 2011. Thereafter, Sihanouk expressed his intent to stay in Cambodia indefinitely, but returned to Beijing in January 2012 for further medical treatment at the advice of his Chinese doctors.|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed as}} if <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> <b>He</b> <b>stopped</b> and picked it up, and {{approached}} the carriage. Maruja stood up in her seat, with her veil thrown back, her graceful hand extended, her eyes and mouth tremulous with an irresistible smile. The stranger came nearer, singled out Captain Carroll, tossed the fan {{to him with a}} slight nod, and passed on the other side.|$|R

5|$|When Tipu's embassy {{visited the}} court of the French King Louis XVI in 1788, Pope Clement XIV's {{representative}} conveyed the appeal to the embassy. In the Third Anglo-Mysore War (1789–92), the British and their allies defeated Tipu. Desperate to break the alliance of powers surrounding him on all sides, Tipu sought {{to make peace with}} Portugal, the Marathas, and other powers. According to Severine Silva, he consequently gave up the persecution of Christians, opened negotiations with the Portuguese Government and with the Archbishop of Goa, with a promise that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> molesting the Christians, further asserting that he would rebuild all destroyed churches at his own cost. The Christians found their supervision relaxed and Tipu became more conciliatory in his attitude. The Christians now escaped from the camps of Seringapatam and gradually began to enter the neighbouring kingdoms of Coorg and Malabar.|$|E

25|$|Monk was {{renowned for}} his {{distinctive}} style in suits, hats, and sunglasses.

25|$|In late 2014, Bernhard Beibl {{announced}} on his Facebook page that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> collaborating with Tangerine Dream. Shortly thereafter, {{it was announced}} that Tangerine Dream would no longer be touring with Linda Spa or Iris Camaa, but that Ulrich Schnauss had been brought into the fold. Edgar Froese's death in January 2015, however, left this a short-lived line-up.|$|E

25|$|The union {{appealed to}} the Central Labor Union for a general strike and the {{governor}} issued an ultimatum that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> all trucks by midnight, August 5, {{if there was no}} settlement.

Although the strike was gravely weakened by martial law and economic pressure, union leaders made it clear that it would continue.|$|E

25|$|After {{two other}} black deserters were {{captured}} and executed, President Theodore Roosevelt announced <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> executing captured deserters.

25|$|At the iCommons iSummit 07, Lessig {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> focusing {{his attention on}} copyright and related matters and work on political corruption instead, {{as the result of}} a transformative conversation with Aaron Swartz, a young internet prodigy whom Lessig met through his work with Creative Commons. This new work was partially facilitated through his wiki, Lessig Wiki, which he has encouraged the public to use to document cases of corruption. Lessig criticized the revolving door phenomenon in which legislators and staffers leave office to become lobbyists and have become beholden to special interests.|$|E

25|$|On December 28, 1930, when Welles was 15, {{his father}} died of heart and kidney failure {{at the age of}} 58, alone in a hotel in Chicago.

As a result, Orson felt guilty because he believed his father had drunk himself to death because of him. His father's will left it to Orson to name his guardian. When Roger Hill declined, Welles chose Maurice Bernstein.|$|E
25|$|When {{my husband}} was {{translating}} the Book of Mormon, I wrote a part of it, as he dictated each sentence, word for word, {{and when he came}} to proper names he could not pronounce, or long words, he spelled them out, and while I was writing them, if I made any mistake in spelling, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> me and correct my spelling although it was impossible for him to see how I was writing them down at the time.

Ibrahim agreed to write to the Sultan to see if he would change his orders but he also complained about the Greeks being able to continue their attacks. Codrington promised that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> the Greeks and Philhellenes from attacking the Turks and Egyptians. After doing this, he disbanded most of his fleet, which returned to Malta, while the French went to the Aegean.|$|E
