30|$|We have {{previously}} shown [38] that without nitrogen flow, similar ablation conditions will {{not result in}} nanotip but rather nanofiber formation. Given that the threshold intensity for ionization of air is {{lower than that of}} nitrogen [36, 39], this may seem surprising. However, the high pressure plume formed during vaporization creates a shockwave that pushes the ambient gas away, creating a vacuum [40, 41]. Thus, the ablation zone would be devoid of ionized air. The introduction of nitrogen flow during the ablation process forces a mixing of nitrogen gas into the plume. The nitrogen flow also results in rapid cooling, which would aid in halting the vaporization process and initiating melt <b>ejection</b> <b>processes.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, the {{accretion}} and <b>ejection</b> <b>processes</b> from a {{black hole}} accretion system is investigated by means of resistive general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. As a supplement to the results from prior research with non-relativistic simulations, my results confirm that the winds and outflows originated from thin accretion disks can also be observed in general relativistic simulations. In the first part, {{the execution of the}} implementation of resistivity, namely magnetic diffusivity, into the existing non-resistive general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic code HARM is illustrated. The test simulations of the new code include the comparison with analytical solution of the diffusion equation and a classic shock tube test. shows reliable performances in these tests. In the second part, is applied to investigate the evolution of magnetized tori. The results show that the existence of resistivity leads to inefficient accretions of matter from tori onto black holes by weakening the magnetorotational instability inside the tori. An indication for a critical magnetic diffusivity in this simulation setup is found beyond which no magnetorotational instability develops in the linear regime. In the third part, as the main purpose of this PhD project, is used to perform simulations of magnetically diffusive thin accretion disks that are threaded by a large-scale poloidal magnetic field around non-rotating and rotating black holes. These long-term simulations last 3000 code time units, which are about 195 rotation periods at the disk inner boundary, correspondingly. Their computational domains extend from black hole horizon to 80 Schwarzschild radii. Outflows driven from the accretion disk are clearly seen. These outflows have the typical radial velocity of 0. 1 speed of light. In my analyses, I argue that these outflows are driven by the magnetic pressure gradient from the toroidal magnetic field generated by the rotation of the disk. The small ratios of the poloidal field strengths to the toroidal field strengths suggest the interpretation of the outflows as "tower jet," rather than centrifugally driven winds (Blandford-Payne effect). Furthermore, I find direct evidence of the growths of magnetorotational instabilities inside the accretion disks, which are suppressed by the increasing levels of magnetic diffusivity. This suppression leads to inefficient accretion and <b>ejection</b> <b>processes</b> of the accretion system. Finally, the influences of rotating black holes on the accretion systems are explored. The results show an suppression effect on the black hole spin on the accretion and <b>ejection</b> <b>processes</b> in the system. The tangled field lines within the ergosphere induced by the black hole rotation produce magnetic pressure that pushes against the accreting matter from the disk. In the simulations with large spin parameters, energy extraction from the black hole (Blandford-Znajek effect) is observed, which is, nevertheless, ∼ 10 ^ 2 times smaller than the energy production from the disk outflow...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this Ph. D. thesis {{research}} is a new piezoelectrically driven micromachined ultrasonic atomizer concept that utilizes fluid cavity resonances in the 15 MHz range along with acoustic wave focusing to generate the pressure gradient required for droplet or jet ejection. This ejection technique exhibits low-power operation while addressing the key challenges associated with other atomization technologies including production of sub- 5 um diameter droplets, low-temperature operation, the capacity to scale throughput up or down, and simple, low-cost fabrication. This thesis research includes device development and fabrication as well as experimental characterization and theoretical modeling of the acoustics and fluid mechanics underlying device operation. The main goal is to {{gain an understanding of}} the fundamental physics of these processes in order to achieve optimal design and controlled operation of the atomizer. Simulations of the acoustic response of the system for various device geometries and different ejection fluid properties predict the resonant frequencies of the device and confirm that pressure field focusing occurs. High-spatial-resolution stroboscopic visualization of fluid ejection under various operating conditions is used to investigate whether the proposed atomizer is capable of operating in either the discrete-droplet or continuous-jet mode. The results of the visualization experiments combined with a scaling analysis provide a basic understanding of the physics governing the <b>ejection</b> <b>process</b> and allow for the establishment of simple scaling laws that prescribe the mode (e. g., discrete-droplet vs. continuous-jet) of ejection. In parallel, a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the fluid interface evolution and droplet formation and transport during the <b>ejection</b> <b>process</b> provides in-depth insight into the physics of the <b>ejection</b> <b>process</b> and determines the limits of validity of the scaling laws.
