5|$|In 1973 at {{the height}} of his popularity, Donovan met actor-turned writer Tom Tryon and the two entered into a {{long-term}} relationship the following year. Tryon was deeply closeted and <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> disturbed by Donovan's notoriety. Their relationship ended in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Though Scott drew heavily {{upon his}} wife's intense {{personality}} in his writings, {{much of the}} conflict between them stemmed from the boredom and isolation Zelda experienced when Scott was writing. She would often interrupt {{him when he was}} working, and the two <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> miserable throughout the 1920s. Scott had become severely alcoholic, Zelda's behavior became increasingly erratic, and neither made any progress on their creative endeavors.|$|E

5|$|Upon his release, Whale hired one of {{the male}} nurses from the {{hospital}} to be his personal live-in nurse.

5|$|Anne {{was plagued}} by ill health {{throughout}} her life, and she <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> lame and obese from her thirties. Despite seventeen pregnancies by her husband, Prince George of Denmark, she died without surviving issue and was the last monarch of the House of Stuart. Under the Act of Settlement 1701, which excluded all Catholics, she was succeeded by her second cousin George I of the House of Hanover, whose maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, was a daughter of James VI and I.|$|E
5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} {{its way through the}} {{ratification}} process, Republicans in Congress <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E

5|$|Hinman {{announced}} on April 20, 2009 {{his intention to}} step down as leader. He remained the party's leader in an interim capacity until the leadership convention. Former Canadian Federation of Independent Business provincial director Danielle Smith and Mark Dyrholm, a chiropractor in Calgary, announced their candidacy at the June convention. The party viewed the leadership campaign with optimism, announcing that its membership was growing rapidly as Albertans <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> frustrated with the Stelmach government's performance.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Tammany Hall boss Carmine DeSapio led {{the effort}} to defeat Eleanor's son, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr., in the {{election}} for New York Attorney General. Eleanor <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> disgusted with DeSapio's political conduct {{through the rest of}} the 1950s. Eventually, she would join with her old friends Herbert Lehman and Thomas Finletter to form the New York Committee for Democratic Voters, a group dedicated to opposing DeSapio's reincarnated Tammany Hall. Their efforts were eventually successful, and DeSapio was forced to relinquish power in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Kiprusoff {{began the}} 2003–04 season {{competing}} with Vesa Toskala for the backup spot behind Nabokov, leading to speculation of a trade. Ultimately relegated to third-string status, Kiprusoff <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> frustrated, {{as he did}} not play in any games through {{the first quarter of}} the season. He was then finally traded to the Calgary Flames in exchange for a second-round draft pick on November 16, 2003, after Calgary starter Roman Turek suffered an injury.|$|E

5|$|Out {{of various}} provinces of today's Poland, Christianity's spread was slowest in Pomerania, where it gained a {{significant}} following only around the 12th century. Initially, the clergy {{came from the}} Western Christian European countries; native Polish clergy took three or four generations to emerge, and were supported by the monasteries and friars that <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> common in the 12th century. By the 13th century Roman Catholicism had become the dominant religion throughout Poland.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{indigenous}} {{cultures in}} North America <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> complex, and some, {{such as the}} pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies. From approximately 800 to 1600 AD the Mississippian culture flourished, and its largest city Cahokia is considered the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States. In the southern Great Lakes region, the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee) was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries, lasting {{until the end of}} the Revolutionary War.|$|E
5|$|Relations between Nasser and Qasim <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> bitter on 9 March, after Qasim's forces {{suppressed}} a rebellion in Mosul, launched {{a day earlier}} by a pro-Nasser Iraqi RCC officer backed by UAR authorities. Nasser had considered dispatching troops to aid his Iraqi sympathizers, but decided against it. He clamped down on Egyptian communist activity due to the key backing Iraqi communists provided Qasim. Several influential communists were arrested, including Nasser's old comrade Khaled Mohieddin, who {{had been allowed to}} re-enter Egypt in 1956.|$|E

5|$|Starting in August 1941, when {{it became}} clear to some in the Propaganda Ministry and the Wehrmacht high command that the war would likely extend into 1942, Goebbels <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{concerned}} about the triumphant tone of the communiques. However, a string of spectacular victories in September, especially in the Battle of Kiev, removed any restraint from the texts, making propagandists's work more difficult later on, when they had to explain the Wehrmacht's failures to the German public which was rapidly losing confidence in a swift victory.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Senate <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{alarmed at}} the slave-army's depredations and {{continued}} military successes. Eventually Rome fielded {{an army of}} eight legions under the harsh but effective leadership of Marcus Licinius Crassus. The war ended in 71 BC when, after a long and bitter fighting retreat before the legions of Crassus, and {{the realization that the}} legions of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus were moving in to entrap them, the armies of Spartacus launched their full strength against Crassus' legions and were utterly defeated. Of the survivors, some 6,000 were crucified along the Appian way.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{budget was}} quickly surpassed, {{and back in}} Los Angeles, Wasserman <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> frustrated. He was regularly confronting Ned Tanen, the executive in charge of production for Universal, in person over the costs. Sean Daniel, another studio executive, was not reassured {{when he came to}} Chicago and saw the production had set up a special facility for the 70 cars used in the chase sequences. Filming there, which was supposed to have concluded in the middle of September, continued into late October.|$|E

5|$|Al-Qassam {{concentrated}} {{his activities}} on the lower classes, setting up a night school for casual laborers and preaching to them as an imam, first in the Jerini Mosque, {{and later in the}} Istiqlal Mosque. He would seek them out on the streets, in brothels and hashish dens. His greatest following came from the landless ex-tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where purchases of agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labor policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods. Al-Qassam <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> popular with northern Palestine's poorer Muslims and was frequently sought out to preach at Mawlid celebrations.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War {{developed}} and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on {{an increasing number}} of issues, the U.S. government <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which saw it as a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{prominent}} {{position in}} the party, Harper's relationship with the Reform Party leadership was frequently strained. In early 1994, he criticized a party decision to establish a personal expense account for Manning {{at a time when}} other Reform MPs had been asked to forego parliamentary perquisites. He was formally rebuked by the Reform executive council despite winning support from some MPs. His relationship with Manning <b>grew</b> <b>increasingly</b> fractious in the mid-1990s, and he pointedly declined to express any opinion on Manning's leadership during a 1996 interview. This friction was indicative of a fundamental divide between the two men: Harper was strongly committed to conservative principles and opposed Manning's inclinations toward populism, which Harper saw as leading to compromise on core ideological matters.|$|E
