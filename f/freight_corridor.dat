25|$|The Northern East West <b>Freight</b> <b>Corridor</b> was an {{initiative}} by the International Union of Railways aiming {{to establish a}} <b>freight</b> <b>corridor</b> from the Far East to North America. The route would use the Ofoten Line and transship from rail to ship at Narvik. The main report for the project was made in 2004, but since there had been limited funding for the project. In 2005, Ofotbanen entered the container freight market, with a train running from Narvik via Sweden to Oslo, both via the Meråker Line and via the Kongsvinger Line. The trains would continue to Drammen when necessary.|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} development and competitiveness in Europe is heavily dependent on an efficient transport system. Movement of goods and people is essential for a competitive industry and successful trade. As {{a result of an}} intensified transport business, consumption of fossil fuels has increased dramatically. As a consequence, there are increased emissions of dangerous greenhouse gases. Transports are often mentioned as an area with high impact on the environment. Some of the problems highlighted are; dependence of fossil fuels, emissions and noise from trucks. To meet future demands of a growing freight business in Europe, the European Commission has launched an action plan with proposals on how to reduce the negative environmental impact. The action plan presents a concept called Green <b>freight</b> <b>corridors</b> with the aim to create a sustainable and efficient logistics system through collaboration between community, business and academic. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze and evaluate the concept of green <b>freight</b> <b>corridors</b> in relation to identified proposals for a sustainable and efficient logistics system. In order to fulfill the purpose a literature review was conducted together with interviews. In total thirteen interviews were carried out. The respondents represented either the buyer of transports or hauler from freight companies or trade associations within transport sector. A number of areas for sustainable and efficient logistics system were identified and the findings were compared and evaluated against the concept of Green <b>freight</b> <b>corridors.</b> Several similarities within the area of sustainable and efficient logistic system were identified from literature review and interviews in relation to the concept of Green <b>freight</b> <b>corridors.</b> Also, the areas with further potential have been recognized within the concept of Green <b>freight</b> <b>corridors.</b> The concept contributes to an overall perspective of the logistics system and can be a great tool for development of new ideas and methods for freight business and warehousing.

[...] While a rail line exists through Siskiyou Summit, it is difficult for trains to use even in good weather, due to an excessively steep grade, and is often uneconomical to use in winter weather.
