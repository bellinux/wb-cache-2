Increasing proportions of brittle kemp {{can be found}} in well-preserved examples from the period. In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population. The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces. The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to <b>hand</b> <b>spinning.</b> Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes <b>hand</b> <b>spinning</b> difficult. The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively. From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.|$|E
25|$|In {{early modern}} Europe, there was {{significant}} demand for products from Mughal India, particularly cotton textiles, {{as well as}} goods such as spices, peppers, indigo, silks, and saltpeter (for use in munitions). European fashion, for example, became increasingly dependent on Mughal Indian textiles and silks. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Mughal India accounted for 95% of British imports from Asia, and the Bengal Subah province alone accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia. Amiya Kumar Bagchi estimates 10.3% of Bihar's populus were involved in <b>hand</b> <b>spinning</b> thread, 2.3% weaving, and 9% in other manufacturing trades, in 1809-13, to satisfy this demand. In contrast, {{there was very little}} demand for European goods in Mughal India, which was largely self-sufficient, thus Europeans had very little to offer, except for some woolens, unprocessed metals and a few luxury items. The trade imbalance caused Europeans to export large quantities of gold and silver to Mughal India in order to pay for Indian imports.|$|E
25|$|The flyer is the {{original}} type of mechanical spinning frame and {{is believed to be}} a direct development of the Saxony wheel used in <b>hand</b> <b>spinning.</b> It is suitable for producing thick smooth yarns from coarse quality wools and hairs, but is falling into disuse because of the low speed at which the spindles have to run. As the yarn leaves the front rollers it is guided through a porcelain ring {{to the top of a}} revolving spindle, around and down one of the arms of the flyer and onto the bobbin. The bobbin is carried on a lifter plate and moves up and down the spindle. As the flyer revolves, imparting twist to the yarn, the bobbin which is free to rotate on the spindle is pulled round by the spun yarn. A felt or cloth washer is placed between the lifter plate and bobbin to retard the revolving bobbin and create adequate yarn tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly on the bobbin. When the bobbins are full they are removed and replaced by empty ones. This action is termed doffing and is done manually on this machine.|$|E

2500|$|Samuel Crompton's Spinning Mule was {{introduced}} in 1779. [...] Mule implies [...] "hybrid" [...] {{because it was a}} combination of the spinning jenny and the water frame, in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating. [...] Crompton's mule was able to produce finer thread than <b>hand</b> <b>spinning</b> and at a lower cost. [...] Mule spun thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp, and finally allowed Britain to produce highly competitive yarn in large quantities.|$|E
2500|$|According to quantum mechanics, {{electromagnetic}} waves {{can also be}} viewed as streams of particles called photons. [...] When viewed in this way, the polarization of an electromagnetic wave is determined by a quantum mechanical property of photons called their spin. [...] A photon has one of two possible spins: it can either spin in a right hand sense or a left hand sense about its direction of travel. Circularly polarized {{electromagnetic waves}} are composed of photons with only one type of spin, either right- or left-hand. [...] Linearly polarized waves consist of equal numbers of right and left <b>hand</b> <b>spinning</b> photons, with their phase synchronized so they superpose to give oscillation in a plane.|$|E

2500|$|In medi√¶val times, poor {{families}} {{had such a}} need for yarn {{to make their own}} cloth and clothes that practically all girls and unmarried women would keep busy spinning, and [...] "spinster" [...] became synonymous with an unmarried woman. Subsequent improvements with spinning wheels and then mechanical methods made hand-spinning increasingly uneconomic, but as late as the twentieth century hand-spinning remained widespread in poor countries: in conscious rejection of international industrialization, Gandhi was a notable practitioner. The <b>hand</b> <b>spinning</b> [...] movement that he initiated {{as a part of the}} Indian freedom struggle has made the handwoven cloth known as [...] "Khadi" [...] made from handspun cotton yarn world-famous. Women spinners of cotton yarn still continue to work to produce handspun yarn for the weaving of Khadi in Ponduru, a village in South India.|$|E
2500|$|The Swaraj Party {{which had}} been the Justice party's main {{opposition}} merged with the Indian National Congress in 1935 when the Congress decided {{to participate in the}} electoral process. The Madras Province Congress party was led by S. Satyamurti and was greatly rejuvenated by its successful organisation of the Salt Satyagraha and Civil Disobedience movement of 1930-31. The Civil Disobedience movement, the Land Tax reduction agitations and Union organizations helped the Congress to mobilize popular opposition to the Bobbili Raja government. The revenue agitations brought the peasants into the Congress fold and the Gandhian <b>hand</b> <b>spinning</b> programme assured the support of weavers. Preferential treatment given to European traders brought the support of the indigenous industrialists and commercial interests. The Congress had effective campaigners like Satyamurti and Rajaji while the Justice party had only Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar to counter them. The Congress election manifesto was populist in nature and promised to reduce land revenue taxes, to ensure decent working conditions and wages for the laborers, low rents and all around prosperity. It even appealed to the Europeans who had reserved seats in the Assembly. It also appealed to the nationalist sentiment of the populace. Commenting on the Congress's manifesto, the Indian Annual Register said: ...|$|E

25|$|A tightly {{spun wool}} yarn made from fibre {{with a long}} staple length in it is called worsted. It is <b>hand</b> <b>spun</b> from combed top, and the fibres all lie in the same {{direction}} as the yarn. A woollen yarn, in contrast, is <b>hand</b> <b>spun</b> from a rolag or other carded fibre (roving, batts), where the fibres are not as strictly aligned to the yarn created. The woollen yarn, thus, captures much more air, and makes for a softer and generally bulkier yarn. There are two main techniques to create these different yarns: short draw creates worsted yarns, and long draw creates woollen yarns. Often a spinner will spin using a combination of both techniques and thus make a semi-worsted yarn.|$|R

For all John saw in the crowd that filled the place was Dolly, tripping to and fro tray in <b>hand,</b> <b>spinning</b> at her wheel, or resting beside Aunt Maria, twin sister of Mrs. Hill, in an imposing cap instead of the pumpkin hood. Pretty Dolly was the belle of the kitchen; for she alone of all the dozen damsels on duty looked her part, and was in truth a country girl, rich in the old-fashioned gifts and graces of health, modesty, housewifely skill, and the sweet maidenliness which girls who come out at sixteen soon lose for ever. Her dress, too, was wonderfully complete and becoming, though only a pink and white chintz, a mob-cap, and an uncompromising apron, with the pin-ball, scissors, keys, and linen pocket hanging at the side. The others looked like stage soubrettes, and acted like coquettish young ladies who knew nothing about their work. But Dolly was genuine throughout, so she proved a great success; and Aunt Maria took all the credit of it to herself, felt that she had done a good thing in bringing so much youth, energy, and loveliness to market, and expressed her satisfaction by talking {{a great deal about}} [...] "our family," [...] which, as she was a Smith, was certainly large enough to furnish endless gossip.|$|E
