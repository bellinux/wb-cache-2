With four players scoring over 50 points, including rookie Scott Gomez's team leading 51 assists, Stevens' 29 points were only <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> tenth on the team, and third among defencemen behind Niedermayer and Brian Rafalski. Stevens also set an NHL record, becoming {{the first player to}} play in 600 games with two teams. After finishing the season in fourth place in the conference, the Devils swept the Florida Panthers and defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games.|$|E
5|$|During {{the regular}} season, Clemson was No. 10 in rushing yards, {{averaging}} 236.4 per game. Its passing offense was somewhat weaker, ranked No. 63 and averaging 210.1 yards per game.

In scoring offense, the Tigers averaged 36.0 points per game, <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> No. 14 {{in the country in}} that category.|$|E

As a whole, the Hoosiers accumulated 3,818yards of offense before the Independence Bowl. 2,156yards of this total were passing yards and came through the air, while the remaining 1,662yards were gained by Indiana's running backs and fullbacks on the ground.|$|E

5|$|By {{this point}} the Air Ministry was desperate to get any unit into service. Satisfied with his visit in May, Dowding {{suggested}} that the Mk. I was <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> operational testing purposes. On 11 June 1939, AI was given the highest priority and provisions were made to supply 11 additional Blenheims to No 25 squadron at RAF Hawkinge (for a total of 21). Since each of the parts came from different suppliers, and the fitters were unfamiliar with any of it, members of the AI team would have to hand-assemble the components as they arrived and instruct the fitters on the sets.|$|E

5|$|Clemson's {{defense was}} strongest against the rush. During the regular season, the Tigers allowed {{an average of}} 101.8 yards per game on the ground, <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> No. 18 nationally. Their passing defense {{was not nearly as}} successful. On average, the Tigers allowed 238.6 yards per game through the air, making their pass defense the 97th best in {{division}} I-A football during the regular season. With both categories combined, the defense was ranked No. 37. In terms of points allowed, rather than yardage, the Tigers were ranked No. 23 after giving up an average of 19.3 yards per game.|$|E

In 2006 Barlow claimed that she had again been asked to return to Coronation Street, but had refused as she felt the storylines were not <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Mavis. Barlow stated in 2007 that she is unlikely to return, because she would be unable to cope with the accelerated production schedule of one more episode a week since her last appearance in 1997.

He helped Eastwood to a play-off position in 2010–11 with a fifth-place finish, although {{they were unable to}} play in them as their ground was not deemed <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the Conference Premier.

5|$|On the ground, Texas' rushing {{offense was}} led by two running backs: Ricky Williams and Shon Mitchell.

Williams accumulated 990 rushing yards during the regular season. That figure was a record for Texas freshmen. Protecting Williams, Mitchell, and Brown was a successful offensive line led by All-America guard Dan Neil.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech offense progressed {{during the}} course of the regular season. In the Hokies' first six games, they {{averaged}} just 13.4 points. In their final six games, they averaged 42.3 points per game. Averaged across the season, Tech scored 29.2 points per game, <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> No. 28 nationally. The Hokies also finished with 4,233 net yards and 321 points; both figures were in the top five for Virginia Tech season offenses to that point.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's defense {{likewise}} {{was more}} successful against opponents' rushing offense than their passing attack. Tech permitted {{an average of}} 99.3 yards per game on the ground (16th), but allowed 224.4 yards per game through the air (79th). In total, Tech was ranked the No. 27 defense in the country—slightly better than Clemson. In scoring defense, the Hokies allowed 22.6 points per game on average, <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> No. 45. In this category, they were worse than the Tigers.|$|E

5|$|After launch, {{the missile}} was guided towards the target {{location}} {{as determined by}} the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, but <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker in the nose was activated to acquire and lock on the target. The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E

However, Coach is too reluctant to tell her about Roy because she appears to like him and wants her father's blessings. To make matters worse, at Melville's restaurant, Roy forces her to pay for dinner herself, which makes Coach angrier. Therefore, witnessing Roy's treatment on her, Coach's friends convince him to tell Lisa about Roy before it is too late.|$|E

The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard worked around the clock, and in 72 hours she was restored to a battle-ready state, judged <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> {{two or three weeks}} of operations, as Nimitz required. Her flight deck was patched, and whole sections of internal frames were cut out and replaced. Repairs continued even as she sortied, with work crews from the repair ship , herself damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor six months earlier, still aboard.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars and the {{subsequent}} agricultural depression, coupled {{with the collapse of the}} Tonbridge Bank in 1812, Woodgate was declared bankrupt in 1816. In that year, Woodgate offered Somerhill for sale to the Duke of Wellington, who declined to buy it as the foxhunting was not <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> his liking. Somerhill was bought from the descendants of William Woodgate in November 1819 by James Alexander, MP. By 1830, Somerhill had been substantially repaired, and new landscaping was undertaken. In 1832, Anthony Salvin was engaged to make improvements to the house, but retaining its original style. During the severe winter of 1835-36, skating was possible on the lake at Somerhill for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Harrison was unpopular {{with the}} party and the country, and many of Blaine’s old {{supporters}} encouraged him to run for the nomination. Blaine had denied any interest in the nomination months before his resignation, but some of his friends, including Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania and James S. Clarkson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, took it for false modesty and worked for his nomination anyway. When Blaine resigned from the cabinet, his boosters were certain that he was a candidate, but the majority of the party stood by the incumbent. Harrison was renominated on the first ballot, but die-hard Blaine delegates still gave their champion 182 and 1/6 votes, <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> second place.|$|E
