5|$|Indo-European {{parallels}} {{have been}} proposed between myths of Fenrir and the Persian demon Ahriman. The Yashts refer to a story where Taxma Urupi rode Angra Mainyu as a horse for thirty years. An elaboration of this allusion is found only in a late Parsi commentary. The ruler Taxmoruw (Taxma Urupi) managed to lasso Ahriman (Angra Mainyu) and keep him tied up while taking him for a ride three times a day. After thirty years Ahriman outwitted and swallowed Taxmoruw. In a sexual encounter with Ahriman, Jamshid, Taxmoruw's brother, inserted his hand into Ahriman's anus and pulled out his brother's corpse. His hand withered from contact with the diabolic innards. The suggested parallels with Fenrir myths are the binding of an evil being by a ruler figure and the subsequent swallowing of the ruler figure by the evil being (Odin and Fenrir), trickery involving the thrusting of a <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> monster's orifice and the affliction of the inserted limb (Týr and Fenrir).|$|E
500|$|Flexion {{describes}} a bending movement that decreases the angle between a segment and its proximal segment. [...] For example, bending the elbow, or clenching a <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fist, {{are examples of}} flexion. When sitting down, the knees are flexed. When a joint can move forward and backward, such as the neck and trunk, flexion refers to movement in the anterior direction. Flexion of the shoulder or hip refers to movement of the arm or leg forward.|$|E
500|$|Mulder later tells Scully that he {{does not}} believe Modell is on another killing spree, and, after an odd {{interview}} with Linda, believes she is the killer and has the same powers as Modell. Skinner suspends Mulder, but Mulder vows to prove his theory right. He talks with Modell's therapist again, who mentions that a nun from the Little Sisters of Charity had called him a [...] "conquered warrior". On a hunch, Mulder tries to show her a picture of Linda. The phone rings and, after stating she is with Mulder, she sticks her <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fuse box and is fatally electrocuted.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the large}} amounts of {{concentration}} and chakra needed to collect and control the lightning-chakra, both Kakashi and Sasuke are initially limited to using Chidori {{only a few times}} a day. They are shown to have increased their limits in Part II, but to what extent is unclear. As the creator of the Chidori, Kakashi has reached a level of control great enough that he can split a bolt of lightning, resulting in his version being called the [...] Sasuke also reaches greater levels of control during Part II, which allows him to reshape the Chidori in his <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> solid sword-like form with variations Chidori Stream, Chidori Needles, or Chidori Spear.|$|E
500|$|Homer {{sings the}} end of the theme song to Family Ties while talking to an {{administrator}} at the annex center. Smithers's recollection of his marriage parodies the two plays Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire, both written by American playwright Tennessee Williams. Homer's bedroom rant to Marge is a parody mishmash of four popular films: ...And Justice for All (1979), A Few Good Men (1992), Patton (1970), and Chinatown (1974). He says: [...] "Look Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one out there every day putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order! You're out of order. The whole freaking system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth?! You can't handle the truth! 'Cause when you reach over and put your <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do! Forget it, Marge, it's Chinatown," [...] all of which are lines from those films.|$|E
2500|$|Paige {{demonstrates}} {{greater control}} over her abilities compared to her primary-universe counterpart. She is able to transform all parts of her body, and was capable of adopting liquid, gaseous, and energy states. Paige can also adapt [...] "bio patterns" [...] to affect specific individuals, including a complex acid that could affect the organic steel skin of Colossus and an energy form Shadowcat could not phase through. She also {{had the ability to}} change only part of her body (such as changing a <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bladed weapon).|$|E
60|$|And so I went <b>into</b> <b>a</b> chamber {{apart with}} the old wife, Atoua. There, muttering prayers, she poured pure water over my <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> ewer of gold, and having dipped <b>a</b> fine cloth <b>into</b> oil wiped my brow with it.|$|R

2500|$|HASAG (also {{known as}} Hugo Schneider AG, or by its {{original}} name in [...] ) was a German metal goods manufacturer founded in 1863. Based in Leipzig, it grew {{from a small}} business making lamps and other small metal products by <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> large factory and publicly traded company that sold its wares in several countries. During the Second World War, Hasag became a Nazi arms-manufacturing conglomerate with dozens of factories across German-occupied Europe using slave labour on a massive scale. Tens of thousands of Jews from Poland, and other prisoners, died producing munition for Hasag.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing where [...] "The Poison Sky" [...] left off, the TARDIS {{takes the}} Doctor, Martha, and Donna {{to the planet}} Messaline. As they emerge from the TARDIS, they are met by {{soldiers}} working for General Cobb. The soldiers force the Doctor to stick his <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> progenation machine, which uses his DNA to generate a female soldier who becomes the Doctor's daughter. They are soon confronted by the other occupants of the planet, the Hath. The Hath attack, taking Martha hostage. The Doctor's daughter causes an explosion that seals off the corridor they are in, trapping Martha on the other side. The Doctor and Donna are taken to see General Cobb in the command center, {{and along the way}} Donna names the Doctor's daughter [...] "Jenny" [...] because the Doctor calls her a generated anomaly.|$|E
2500|$|During 2004, the Discovery Channel {{television}} show MythBusters tested the daddy long-legs venom myth in episode 13 - [...] "Buried in concrete". Hosts Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage first {{established that the}} spider's venom was not as toxic as other venoms, after being told about an experiment whereby mice were injected with venom from both a daddy long-legs and a black widow, with the black widow venom producing a much stronger reaction. After measuring the spider's fangs at approximately 0.25mm, Adam Savage inserted his <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> container with several daddy-long-legs, and reported that he felt a bite which produced a mild, short-lived burning sensation. The bite did in fact penetrate his skin, but did not cause any notable harm. Additionally, recent {{research has shown that}} pholcid venom is relatively weak in its effects on insects.|$|E
50|$|The cold pressor test is a {{cardiovascular}} test {{performed by}} immersing the <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> ice water container, usually for one minute, and measuring changes {{in blood pressure}} and heart rate. These changes relate to vascular response and pulse excitability.|$|R

2500|$|David {{began by}} giving Aquaman {{an entirely new}} look, forsaking his former {{clean-cut}} appearance. Following his discoveries reading the Atlantis Chronicles during Time and Tide, Aquaman withdraws from {{the world for a}} time. Garth finds him weeks later, with his hair and beard grown long, brooding in his cave. Aquaman loses his left hand when the madman Charybdis steals his ability to communicate with sea life and sticks Arthur's <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> piranha-infested pool. This causes Aquaman to become somewhat unhinged, and he begins having prophetic dreams, and then, in need of a [...] "symbol", attaches a harpoon spearhead to his left arm in place of his missing hand. His classic orange shirt is shredded in a battle with Lobo, and rather than replace it, he goes shirtless for a while before donning a gladiatorial manica. After the destruction of the harpoon, Aquaman has it replaced with a cybernetic prosthetic from S.T.A.R. Labs. This new harpoon has a retractable reel that he can fully control.|$|E
2500|$|The {{official}} DOI Handbook explicitly {{states that}} DOIs should display on screens and in print in the format [...] "doi:10.1000/182". Contrary to the DOI Handbook, CrossRef, a major DOI registration agency, recommends displaying a URL (for example, https://doi.org/10.1000/182) {{instead of the}} officially specified format (for example, [...] ) This URL provides the location of an HTTP proxy server which will redirect web accesses to the correct online location of the linked item. This recommendation is primarily {{based on the assumption}} that the DOI is being displayed without being hyper-linked to its appropriate URL – the argument being that without the hyperlink it is not as easy to copy-and-paste the full URL to actually bring up the page for the DOI, thus the entire URL should be displayed, allowing people viewing the page containing the DOI to copy-and-paste the URL, by <b>hand,</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> new window/tab in their browser in order to go to the appropriate page for the document the DOI represents.|$|E
2500|$|Placing {{pressure}} on the wound constricts the blood vessels manually, helping to stem blood flow. [...] When applying pressure, the type {{and direction of the}} wound may have an effect, for instance, a cut lengthways on the hand would be opened up by closing the <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fist, whilst a cut across the hand would be sealed by making a fist. [...] A patient can apply pressure directly to their own wound, if their consciousness level allows. [...] Ideally a barrier, such as sterile, low-adherent gauze should be used between the pressure supplier and the wound, to help reduce chances of infection and help the wound to seal. [...] Third parties assisting a patient are always advised to use protective latex or nitrile medical gloves to reduce risk of infection or contamination passing either way. [...] Direct pressure can be used with some foreign objects protruding from a wound; padding is applied from each side of the object to push in and seal the wound - objects are never removed.|$|E
