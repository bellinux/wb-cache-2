5|$|Most are single-player games. On {{multi-user}} systems, leaderboards {{are often}} shared between players. Some roguelikes allow traces of former player characters {{to appear in}} later game sessions {{in the form of}} ghosts or grave markings. Some games such as NetHack <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> player's former characters reappear as enemies within the dungeon. Multi-player turn-based derivatives such as TomeNET, MAngband, and Crossfire do exist and are playable online.|$|E
5|$|Crime and Punishment {{focuses on}} the mental anguish and moral {{dilemmas}} of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov, {{in an attempt to}} defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of such actions, and <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.|$|E

25|$|Although Canadian {{films have}} often {{received}} critical praise, and the National Film Board has won more Academy Awards {{than almost any}} other institution (for both their animation and documentary work), in many Canadian cities moviegoers do not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> option of seeing such films, as they have poor distribution and are not shown at any theatres.

25|$|Certain revolvers, called double-action-only (DAO) or, more {{correctly}} {{but less}} commonly, self-cocking, lack the latch {{that enables the}} hammer to be locked to the rear, and thus can only be fired in the double-action mode. With no way to lock the hammer back, DAO designs tend to have bobbed or spurless hammers, and may <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> hammer completely covered by the revolver's frame (i.e., shrouded or hooded). These are generally intended for concealed carrying, where a hammer spur could snag when the revolver is drawn. The potential reduction in accuracy in aimed fire is offset by the increased capability for concealment.|$|E
25|$|In Hong Kong, {{because of}} its {{one and a half}} century British rule, many Hong Kong people will pick English names as early as {{attending}} English classes in kindergarten, or <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> English alias embedded in official documentation. The English aliases are widely used at schools and at work. Similar to Singapore, which shares a similar historical development, it is very common among Hongkongers to address each other with an English alias. An English alias can be accepted as part of the name in official documentation, but whether to include such is an option to individuals.|$|E
25|$|The World Trade Center's {{twin towers}} started {{construction}} in 1966. The next year, the Ostankino Tower succeeded the Empire State Building as the tallest freestanding {{structure in the}} world. The Empire State also lost the title of world's tallest building in 1970, as the taller North Tower surpassed the Empire State's height on October 19 of that year, and topped out on December 23, 1970. The Twin Towers opened their 110th-floor observatory in December 1975, which meant that the Empire State Building did not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> tallest observatory in the city anymore. The Empire State Building also lost income during this time, {{as many of the}} broadcast stations moved to the World Trade Center in 1971, although the Port Authority continued to pay the broadcasting leases for the Empire State until 1984.|$|E

25|$|Although Fredericksburg was its own radio {{market and}} the {{ownership}} group believed the city was large enough for a locally focused TV station, the fact remained that WHFV was attempting to enter a very saturated regional television market. There was first the proximity of two well-established NBC stations, WRC-TV Washington and WWBT Richmond, which were available over the air in most of WHFV's coverage area. Second, any reasonably popular syndicated programming {{was likely to be}} already picked up by stations in the larger markets – especially Washington with its two independent stations – leaving WHFV to either duplicate the shows or pick up weaker ones. Third, all other network affiliates in the area were on VHF, so many viewers were not used to tuning to a UHF channel or did not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right antenna. WHFV was forced to run advertisements explaining how to tune a UHF channel.|$|E

500|$|According to the literature, {{it appears}} that the {{majority}} of free Athenians owned at least one slave. Aristophanes, in Plutus, portrays poor peasants who have several slaves; Aristotle defines a house as containing freemen and slaves. Conversely, not owning even one slave was a clear sign of poverty. In the celebrated discourse of Lysias For the Invalid, a cripple pleading for a pension explains [...] "my income is very small and now I'm required to do these things myself and do not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> means to purchase a slave who can do these things for me." [...] However, the huge slave populations of the Romans were unknown in ancient Greece. When Athenaeus cites the case of Mnason, friend of Aristotle and owner of a thousand slaves, this appears to be exceptional. Plato, owner of five slaves {{at the time of his}} death, describes the very rich as owning 50 slaves.|$|E
500|$|Official Xbox Magazine {{gave the}} game a 4.5 {{out of a}} {{possible}} 10, stating, [...] "Whether you're swinging a pipe or a scalpel, the controls never feel responsive, and rotten collision detection will drive you mad before Jigsaw's twisted games <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> chance." [...] David Clayman, writer for IGN, gave Saw a 7.5 {{out of a possible}} ten, earning it a rating of [...] "Good". Clayman praised the unique take on the survival horror franchise and the omnipresence of Jigsaw, but criticized the repetitive puzzles and the flawed combat system. Clayman even called the combat the Achilles' heel of the game. He went on to say: Overall, Saw is a welcome entry in the horror genre that provides a good dosage of thrills. Depending on your tolerance for repetition, it's a good way to test your nerves and scare yourself silly during a dark and stormy night.|$|E
500|$|The {{sport of}} target rifle {{shooting}} {{is an option}} among those in the 3rd year and above, but only available {{to members of the}} CCF from 4th form. In the first and second years, there is an air rifle club, which teaches basics before moving onto [...] "rifles". From 3rd form students can join an afternoon shooting club in which they can practice smallbore. At this point being a member of CCF is not needed because CCF starts from 3rd form since the introduction of the EXAD program to 3rd formers. 3rd form students start of with grouping targets using sandbags then progress onto 5 bull and eventually 5 bull and country life style shooting using slings and jackets. However as of 2016/17 the number 8 cadet rifles are being brought out of service so 3rd form shooting has mostly been done using [...] "private" [...] Anschutz rifles. Normally students wouldn't start shooting these rifles until 4th form but due to the situation they have to use these rifles.Those individuals who have talent in smallbore then have the opportunity to shoot fullbore in the summer term during some weekends and <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> chance to take part in competitions such as schools meet or the L In 4th form During the first two terms they do smallbore shooting with 10 bull being the main focus. 10 Bull is done using the private rifles that are more expensive and more accurate than the number 8s. In the trinity term they do fullbore using the L81a2 cadet target rifle.Though they usually have smaller numbers during the summer due to logistical issues and the fact that other [...] "fun"games options are also available such as tennis and sailing. All fullbore shooting is done at Bisley either at Century where they shoot at 300, 500 and 600 yards, or Stickledown range where they can shoot up to 1200 yards though this rarely happens during practice and is instead reserved for the Imperial meeting. In 2017 the RGS entered a main VIII and two cadet pairs into the Schools Meet as well as 4 boys into the NRA Imperial and 2 boys into the Cadets Imperial a newer competition that started in 2016. The RGS also took part in many postal competitions such as the Country life and the Surrey 10 bull league competitions. Over the years the shooting team {{have had a lot of}} success, not only winning many smallbore competitions such as the Staniforth and the Country Life, but also winning the Ashburton at the Annual Schools Meeting held at Bisley, though this hasn't been done by the school for many years. Part of this success is down to the help of many Old Guildfordians and current teachers coaching and helping out those doing shooting at the RGS. Many senior boys also coach the younger students and encourage them to keep shooting as they progress through the school. Those in the team are taught by the Old Guildfordians and shooting masters how to self sight and even self wind coach so that they can take part in more individual competitions such as the Imperial. Countless RGS shooters have gone on to become top level shooters competing at a national level representing Great Britain as well as achieving great individual success such as winning the Queens prize. Ex RGS students have also had great success shooting in Schools Veterans competitions under the Old Guildfordians Rifle club. The Old Guildfordians is a home office approved shooting club and has a club house down at Bisley nicknamed the OG hut or Jabba the hut. The OGs are known for their hilarious antics such as making making members carry around object such as pineapples or melons as a punishment for dropping a point on their last shot or doing silly things such as forgetting their rifles ...|$|E
