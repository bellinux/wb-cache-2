25|$|The NTEU {{has been}} famous for {{aggressive}} {{use of the}} courts to supplement their statutorily-limited powers to bargain and restraints on traditional labor tactics such as strikes and boycotts. In 1972, the union sued President Richard M. Nixon, challenging his decision to bypass Congress and postpone salary increases for all federal workers covered by the <b>General</b> <b>Schedule.</b> This lawsuit, NTEU v. Nixon, resulted in an unprecedented victory that required the government to pay over $533 million in back pay to federal employees. In another lawsuit, Boyce and Dixon v. United States, the removal of two IRS service center employees was reversed, establishing {{for the first time}} the principles that an agency did not have total discretion in penalizing employees and that mitigating circumstances could render an agency-ordered removal an abuse of discretion. Shortly thereafter, in NTEU v. Fasser, the union won the right for federal employees to engage in informational picketing, an action previously deemed banned by federal law. During the Reagan and first Bush administrations, NTEU participated aggressively in numerous court battles. It took the issue of the constitutionality of random drug testing of Customs inspectors all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court in NTEU v. Von Raab and it successfully fought initiatives it viewed as anti-worker proposed by the head of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).|$|E

Although it focuses on manufacturing scheduling, particularly job-shop problems, it does outline work in other areas such as transport scheduling and network routing. GA research in closely related problems, such as bin packing and the TSP, are also covered. Finally, it is shown how distributed parallel GAs may allow practically beneficial recharacterisations of highly complex <b>general</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems. 1 Introduction Practical scheduling problems are numerous and varied. However, many of them share two important characteristics [...] - they are very difficult, and good quality solutions bring highly tangible benefits. In <b>general,</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems are NP-hard [36], consequently there are no known algorithms guaranteed to give an optimal solution and run in polynomial time.
