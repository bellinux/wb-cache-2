5|$|Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen {{described}} the <b>false</b> <b>chanterelle</b> in 1781, noting both its resemblance with the true chanterelles and people's propensity to confuse them. The <b>false</b> <b>chanterelle</b> was then {{placed in the}} genus Clitocybe, but it was later observed that its forked gills and dextrinoid spores indicated a relationship to Paxillus.

5|$|Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca, {{commonly}} known as the <b>false</b> <b>chanterelle,</b> is a species of fungus in the family Hygrophoropsidaceae.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis was {{originally}} circumscribed in 1888 by German mycologist Joseph Schröter as a subgenus of Cantharellus. It contained a single species, the widespread H.aurantiaca, {{commonly known as}} the <b>false</b> <b>chanterelle.</b> German naturalist Bernhard Studer-Steinhäuslin concluded in 1900 that the fungus was more appropriately placed in the genus Clitocybe, based on its white spores, decurrent gills, and lack of a ring on the stipe. This classification was adopted in the early writings of influential mycologist Rolf Singer, who in 1943 proposed that Hygrophoropsis should be a subgenus of Clitocybe.|$|E
5000|$|<b>False</b> <b>chanterelles</b> (Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca), as {{the name}} suggests, can look like real chanterelles (Cantharellus cibarius) to the inexperienced eye. The latter do not have sharp gills, but rather blunt veins on the underside. Misidentification {{in this case is}} not likely to prove {{significantly}} dangerous, as <b>false</b> <b>chanterelles</b> are considered edible, but unpleasant tasting. Mild symptoms have been reported from consuming them. Conversely, the Jack O'Lantern mushroom is often mistaken for a chanterelle, and it is potently toxic.|$|R
25|$|Typical {{mushrooms}} are the fruit bodies {{of members of}} the order Agaricales, whose type genus is Agaricus and type species is the field mushroom, Agaricus campestris. However, in modern molecularly defined classifications, not all members of the order Agaricales produce mushroom fruit bodies, and many other gilled fungi, collectively called mushrooms, occur in other orders of the class Agaricomycetes. For example, chanterelles are in the Cantharellales, <b>false</b> <b>chanterelles</b> such as Gomphus are in the Gomphales, milk-cap mushrooms (Lactarius, Lactifluus) and russulas (Russula), as well as Lentinellus, are in the Russulales, while the tough, leathery genera Lentinus and Panus are among the Polyporales, but Neolentinus is in the Gloeophyllales, and the little pin-mushroom genus, Rickenella, along with similar genera, are in the Hymenochaetales.|$|R
5|$|There are 16 {{accepted}} {{species of}} Hygrophoropsis, found {{in both the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus that causes brown rot in the wood it colonises. The fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, peat, and on woodchips. They are convex to infundibuliform (funnel-shaped) and have decurrent, forked brightly colored gills. The spores are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. Because H.aurantiaca has orange gills, it has been mistaken for a chanterelle, and hence it has been called a <b>false</b> <b>chanterelle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{a member}} of Hygrophoropsis, Aphroditeola olida is also similar in {{appearance}} to H.aurantiaca but can be distinguished from the <b>false</b> <b>chanterelle</b> by its smaller, pinkish fruit bodies and candy-like odour. It also has smaller spores. Chrysomphalina chrysophylla has a yellowish brown cap and unforked yellow gills. Cortinarius hesleri, an eastern North American species that associates with oaks, has a rusty brown spore print and a cortina in young specimens. The poisonous jack-o'-lantern mushrooms (genus Omphalotus) comprise another group of lookalikes; however, they have straight, non-forked true gills. The European wood-rotting species Haasiella splendidissima, sometimes confused with H.aurantiaca, is most readily distinguished from the latter by its pink spore print and gills that do not fork.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics {{typically}} {{used in the}} field to distinguish Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca from lookalike species include: the soft, dry consistency of its cap; the crowded, decurrent, and forked gills that are saffron to orange coloured; and the lack of any distinctive taste or odour. The <b>false</b> <b>chanterelle</b> can be distinguished from the true chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) by its deeper orange colour, brown base to the stipe, velvety cap surface, forked gills rather than gill-like ridges, softer (and thinner) flesh, and lack of the characteristic apricot-smell. The cap surface of Hygrophoropsis fuscosquamula, found in Britain, has fine brown scales overlaying a dull orange background. H.rufa has velvety brown fur covering its cap, while H.macrospora has cream gills and stipe. Microscopically, these three species have larger spores than H.aurantiaca. H.tapinia, found in a range extending from southern Florida to Central America, is set apart from H.aurantiaca by its growth on or under deciduous trees (never conifers), and smaller spores, which measure 3.3–4.8 by 2.5–3.3µm.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} species. In Europe and North America, it is found in both hardwood and conifer forests, as well as heathland, in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it is common in coniferous forests. It fruits from the ground or from decaying wood, on burned areas in forests, and is often found near fallen trees and tree stumps. The fungus can also grow on woodchips used in gardening and landscaping, and so it also appears on roadsides and other locations where this material is used. Fruit bodies occur singly to scattered, or in clusters, and can be very abundant. Generally considered a dry weather mushroom, it can be plentiful when other mushrooms are scarce. Other locations where the <b>false</b> <b>chanterelle</b> has been recorded include Africa, Central and South America, northern Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Populations in California represent a complex of undescribed species that are collectively referred to as Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca sensu lato.|$|E
500|$|Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen {{described}} the <b>false</b> <b>chanterelle</b> as Agaricus aurantiacus in 1781, reporting that {{it appeared in}} the fir tree forests around Klagenfurt in October. He added {{that it could be}} confused with the chanterelle by the inexperienced, but that its true nature was very different; in contrast to its edible lookalike, he described it as [...] "kind of pernicious". The specific epithet is the Latin word aurantiacus, meaning [...] "orange". James Sowerby illustrated it and gave it the name Agaricus subcantharellus, describing it as a [...] "perhaps unfavourable" [...] variety of A.cantharellus (chanterelle). The fungus was placed in the genus Merulius by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1792, and then Cantharellus by Elias Fries in 1821. Bernhard Studer-Steinhäuslin concluded it could only be classified in the genus Clitocybe in 1900, based on its white spores, decurrent gills and lack of a ring. It was elevated to the status of genus in Emile Martin-Sans' 1929 publication L'Empoisonnement par les champignons et particulièrement les intoxications dues aux Agaricacées du groupe des Clitocybe et du groupe des Cortinarius, with authorship attributed to René Maire. Martin-Sans concurred with Maire's assessment of Hygrophoropsis, suggesting that it represented a form intermediate between Cantharellus and Clitocybe, and was thus worthy of generic ranking. [...] The genus name refers to a resemblance to the genus Hygrophorus. It is commonly known as the <b>false</b> <b>chanterelle.</b>|$|E
500|$|The <b>false</b> <b>chanterelle</b> has a golden-orange cap up to [...] across, {{initially}} convex but becoming funnel-shaped as {{the mushroom}} matures. The cap margin, which remains rolled in a little, becomes wavy or lobed in age. The cap surface {{is covered with}} a fine down. The decurrent gill-like structures are narrow and forked, which is a distinctive and distinguishing feature. They are generally a more intense shade of orange than the cap. Along the stipe, the gills may be slightly crimped. The orange stipe is [...] high and [...] thick, and lacks a ring. It often has a darker, brownish, base. The ability to form sclerotia (compact masses of hardened fungal mycelium) has been documented for H.aurantiaca in laboratory studies. These structures contain glycogen and protein that may be used as food reserves during spore germination.|$|E
500|$|The <b>false</b> <b>chanterelle</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as edible (though not tasty) by some experts, but other authors report it as potentially poisonous. Indeed, Fries described it as venenatus, meaning [...] "poisonous", in 1821. David Arora speculates that the confusion about edibility may be a result of misidentification with the similar-looking but definitely poisonous Omphalotus species. However, extracts made from Nigerian collections were mildly toxic to mice. Some people experience gastrointestinal symptoms after eating the mushroom, possibly due to its high levels of the sugar alcohol arabitol. It was eaten, though not especially highly regarded, by the Zapotec people of Ixtlán de Juárez in Oaxaca. The Tepehuán people of northwestern Mexico also occasionally eat the mushroom, which they refer to in their native language as guin'xacan ("delightful") or kia's gio ("iguana lard"); there, it is commonly prepared by roasting over charcoal, or boiling and garnishing with cheese.|$|E

50|$|The <b>false</b> <b>chanterelle</b> (Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca) has {{a similar}} {{appearance}} and can {{be confused with the}} chanterelle.

50|$|Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca, {{commonly}} known as the <b>false</b> <b>chanterelle,</b> is a species of fungus in the family Hygrophoropsidaceae.It is found across several continents, growing in woodland and heathland, and sometimes on woodchips used in gardening and landscaping.

The thin, often forked gills {{on the underside of the}} cap run partway down the length of the otherwise smooth stipe. Reports on the mushroom's edibility vary - it can serve as food, though not a particularly flavorful one, or it can be mildly poisonous.|$|E
50|$|The <b>False</b> <b>Chanterelle</b> (Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca) has finer, more orange gills and {{a darker}} cap. It is edible, but {{typically}} a culinary disappointment.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{ergosterol}} peroxide and ergosterol were isolated {{for the first}} time from fresh fruit bodies of Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca (<b>False</b> <b>Chanterelle).</b> The substances were characterized mainly by spectroscopic methods (1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, DEPT- 45, DEPT- 90, DEPT- 135, 2 D-NMR). In our study, a new specific thin layer chromatographic method was developed for determination of ergosterol and ergosterol peroxide in H. aurantiaca extract. The method is based on the separation of n-hexane extract on silica gel (Silica Gel G) TLC plates using the optimized solvent system toluene/ethyl acetate (3 : 1; v/v). The main advantages of the developed method are the simplicity of operation and the low cost. The in vitro study results revealed the antiproliferative properties of ergosterol peroxide against LS 180 human colon cancer cells. The described effect was attributed both to altered mitochondrial activity and decreased DNA synthesis. Additionally, in the same concentration range the investigated compound was not toxic to CCD 841 CoTr human colon epithelial cells. The present study suggests that fruit bodies of H. aurantiaca have great potential for producing substances and extracts with potential applications in medicine...|$|E
