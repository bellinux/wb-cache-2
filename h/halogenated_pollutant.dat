Numerous hazardous waste sites have been generated worldwide resulting from the accumulation of xenobiotics in soil and water. Aromatic compounds constitute a large and diverse group of chemicals that are responsible for causing widespread environmental pollution. Among them halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons are very stable to undergo degradation due to resonance energy and inertness of carbon-halogen, carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon covalent bonds. The physico-chemical remedial strategies to clean up sites contaminated by these compounds are inadequate and economically inefficient.

30|$|In conclusion, we have {{developed}} a fast, simple and sensitive detection of haloalkanes and haloalkane dehalogenase activity based on coupled enzymatic reactions. This method may be useful {{for the detection of}} <b>halogenated</b> <b>pollutants</b> in environmental samples or for the detection of haloalkane dehalogenase activity e.g. in enrichment cultures or to control dehalogenase activity during bioremediation. Using DhaA from R. erythropolis as a model enzyme, we showed that the rate-determing step of the multistep assay was dehalogenation of a haloalkanes substrate. Detection can be conducted either “on-bench”, with green colour of a sample indicating the enzymatic conversion of haloalkanes, or, more precisely, by photometric monitoring of the formation of an ABTS oxidation product. Our method allows for the detection of enzyme-mediated haloalkane conversion in buffered systems and, depending on the dehalogenase used, in samples that may contain inorganic halides. High sensitivity (0.025 [*]mM, 0.43 [*]ppm for 1, 3 -dibromopropane), low expedition, and possibilities to vary haloalkane dehalogenase towards broadened substrate tolerance makes this method a versatile alternative to existing procedures.|$|R

Heavy metals {{are one of the}} main contaminants that are removed by the electrokinetics process. Some metals like cadmium (II) can be removed with high consequences on energy expenditure. Chromium (III) can be removed but with low efficiency because of the ease of hydrolysis allowing it to sorb to other substances. Chromium (IV) is also a candidate for electrokinetics removal although chromium (IV) migration is retarded in the presence of sulfur because it will break down into chromium (III). [...] Other heavy metal species that are tested and reported to be treatable include; mercury, zinc, iron, lead, copper, and magnesium. Electrokinetics is also possible with alkali and alkaline earth metals which travel faster in most mediums than heavy metals. At tests between 20 to 30 volts, alkali metals were known to move between 50 to 60 cm per day per volts whereas heavy metal moved at velocities between 10 and 20 cm per day per volts. It is possible that this difference could be because of the slow desorption and dissolution of heavy metals. Electrokinetics {{can also be used to}} treat polar organic compounds (phenol and acetic acid) and radionucleotides (radium), toxic anions (nitrates and sulfates), dense, non-aqueous-phase liquids (DNAPLs), cyanide, petroleum hydrocarbons (diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene and lubricating oils), <b>halogenated</b> <b>pollutants,</b> explosives, <b>halogenated</b> and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|R

Halogenated chemicals represent {{a large and}} toxic class of environmental pollutants. Although regulation of certain halogenated organics resulted in decreasing production of these chemicals in the United States since the 1970 s, others were yet unknown when the regulations were written and production is increasing. In many cases, halogenated organics are persistent in the environment, bioaccumulative, and bioactive, causing toxicological concerns. As such, environmental scientists have studied the processes by which these chemicals can be broken down, and the products that form in these breakdown reactions. In some cases, the toxic effects associated with <b>halogenated</b> organic <b>pollutants</b> can be ameliorated by complete dehalogenation, while incomplete dehalogenation or other transformations can result {{in the production of}} harmful compounds. The mechanisms of these transformations are in most cases not yet well understood, but a fundamental understanding of these reactions helps in the development of effective remediation strategies, and informs the fundamental chemistry inherent to these reactions. Concern about <b>halogenated</b> environmental <b>pollutants</b> has led to investigations of a number of means of dehalogenation including biological attenuation. Microbially mediated dehalogenation represents a major transformation pathway for <b>halogenated</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the environment. Metal-containing cofactors have been implicated in these processes including cobalamin (vitamin B 12), factor F 430, and hemitin. These cofactors are responsible for the reductive dehalogenation of environmental pollutants. These reactions can proceed by a various intermediates, but one of particular interest is the formation of radicals. Radicals have at least one unpaired electron, and as such are highly reactive and transient intermediates. These features can make them difficult to study but their powerful reactivity underscores their importance in environmental transformations. Radical intermediates are often proposed but rarely fully understood in a range of environmental systems. In this thesis, the role of radicals in dehalogenation reactions is explored with particular attention to cobalamin-mediated and nickel-mediated reactions. The mechanism of cobalamin-mediated dechlorination has been studied extensively and evidence for both outer-sphere (radical based) and inner sphere (nonradical based) mechanisms has been presented. In this thesis the literature concerning cobalamin-mediated dehalogenation is reviewed in detail (Chapter 1) and a mechanistic study on the role of radicals in cobalamin-mediated dechlorination of chloroethylenes reconciles previously seemingly contradictory data (Chapter 2). Similarly, both radical and nonradical pathways have been invoked in nickel-mediated dehalogenation of a variety of substrates. Nickel-mediated dehalogenation has not been studied as extensively as cobalt-mediated reactions and the understanding is complicated by the fundamental chemistry of nickel complexes. In order to better understand the chemistry of reduced nickel complexes, particularly their reaction with halogenated organics, a series of nickel complexes was synthesized and characterized (Chapter 3). The relationship between reduced transition metal complexes and their ligands is inextricably linked to whether and how radical intermediates are formed in these systems. The reactivity of two reduced nickel complexes precursors show that these complexes are highly sensitive to slight changes in ligand structure (Chapter 4) ...|$|R

There is potential for AHC bioremediation using sulfate as electron acceptor, {{due to its}} abundance in marine environments and natural presence in soils and groundwater. Objectives: In this work sulfate-reducing anaerobic microorganisms involved in AHC biodegradation were studied. Methods: Anaerobic sludge was incubated at 37 ºC with hexadecane (1 mM) and sulfate (20 mM) in serum vials. Cultures were successively transferred to fresh medium until a stable enrichment was obtained (monitored by microscopy and PCR-DGGE of 16 S rRNA gene). For isolation of AHC-degrading bacteria, serial dilutions and successive transfers are now running using palmitate (1 mM) as an easier substrate. Conclusions: Cultures growing on palmitate show two main bacterial cell types: a rod-shaped bacterium closely related to Desulfomonile limimaris (94 % identity) was predominant in the first 30 days of incubation, when 83 % of the added palmitate was degraded coupled to 4 mM sulfate reduction (suggesting stoichiometric palmitate conversion to acetate); and an oval-shaped bacterium related to Desulforhabdus amnigena (99 % identity) that mainly developed when incubations where extended {{and a total of}} 11. 5 mM sulfate was reduced. Growth of Desulforhabdus was stimulated when incubated with acetate. The role of the Desulfomonile in AHC degradation will be further discussed in the presentation, as well as its halorespiring ability, a characteristic of the Desulfomonile genera.

Nordic Sea Iodda (Mallotus villosus) oil, with low levels of persistent organohalogen pollutants, was used as an additional control diet. The toxicological examination showed that exposure to Baltic herring oil and its fractions at dose levels corresponding to a human intake in the range of 1. 6 to 34. 4 kg Baltic herring per week resulted in minimal effects. The spectrum of effects was similar to that, which is observed after low-level exposure to pollutants such as chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (CDD/F) and chlorinated biphenyls, despite the fact that these contaminants contribute to a minor part of the extractable organically bound chlorine (EOC 1).

The present {{study investigated the}} degradation kinetics and mechanisms of a typical ICMs, diatrizoate (DTZ), by using simulated sunlight (from a solar simulator Suntest CPS+) activated persulfate (PS) oxidation process. The influence of key kinetic factors, such as PS concentrations, pH, dissolved organic matter (DOM), bicarbonate and chloride ions was evaluated. The reaction pathways and mechanisms were proposed based on photoproducts identification using HPLC-MS. UV/PS {{was found to be}} more efficient than UV/H 2 O 2. Sulfate radicals (View the MathML sourceSO 4 ·-) was the dominant reactive species in the oxidation process, and the second-order rate constant of sulfate radical with DTZ was calculated as 1. 90 × 109 M− 1 s− 1 based on laser flash photolysis (LFP) experiments. The results indicated that increasing initial PS concentration favored the decomposition of DTZ; whereas, degradation of DTZ was not affected by pH change ranging from 4. 5 to 8. 5. DOM inhibited DTZ removal rate, while, bicarbonate enhanced it, and chloride ions induced a negative effect above 500 mM. Major oxidation pathways including deiodination-hydroxylation, decarboxylation- hydroxylation and side chain cleavage were proposed, and detailed underlying mechanisms were also discussed. We suggest a direct photodegradation of primary intermediates generated by View the MathML sourceSO 4 ·- attack. These findings demonstrate that <b>halogenated</b> <b>pollutants</b> can readily react with View the MathML sourceSO 4 ·- to form light-absorbing intermediates (ranging from 350 to 500 nm).

Novel PCR primers were evaluated by testing their specificity against a panel of Burkholderia species. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 869 bp of the recA gene differentiated between putative and known Burkholderia species, including the B. cepacia complex. A genus-specific recA PCR yielding 385 bp was also able to identify all Burkholderia examined. Phylogenetic analysis of 188 novel recA genes clarified the taxonomic position of several important Burkholderia strains, revealing the presence of four novel B. cepacia complex recA lineages. Although the recA phylogeny could not differentiate B. cepacia complex strains recovered from clinical infection versus the natural environment, it facilitated the identification of clonal strain types of from both niches.

40|$|The in situ {{chemical}} oxidation (ISCO) is {{a technology}} that requires injecting an oxidant into the ground, in order to treat organic pollutants (present in the soil matrix, or possibly in the groundwater). A specific oxidant is chosen evaluating laboratory tests where the reactivity between the organic pollutants (targets) and the oxidant is assessed; concerning the area to be remediated, pre-treatment investigations are generally limited to the determination of pollutants distribution into the site, the characterization of the latter being realized through geological, topographical and hydrodynamic studies. Both an appropriate distribution of the oxidant in the subsurface, which must cover the entire impacted area, and {{the total amount of}} oxidant to be used are essential factors, deciding of the effectiveness of the approach to the field. In the traditional application scheme, the recourse to ISCO is usually limited to soils having medium to high permeability, and where the chemical oxidant demand is limited.

Thus, analysis of mixtures allows evaluation of combined effects of chemicals each present at low concentrations. Methods We have developed an optimized in vitro E-Screen test to assess the combined functional estrogenic response of human serum. The xenoestrogens in serum were separated from endogenous steroids and pharmaceuticals by solid-phase extraction followed by fractionation by high-performance liquid chromatography. After dissolution of the isolated fraction in ethanol-DMSO, the reconstituted extract was added with estrogen-depleted fetal calf serum to MCF- 7 cells, the growth of which is stimulated by estrogen. After a 6 -day incubation on a microwell plate, cell proliferation was assessed and compared with the effect of a 17 -beta-estradiol standard. Results and conclusions To determine the applicability of this approach, we assessed the estrogenicity of serum samples from 30 pregnant and 60 non-pregnant Danish women thought to be exposed only to low levels of endocrine disruptors. We also studied 211 serum samples from pregnant Faroese women, whose marine diet included whale blubber that contain a high concentration of persistent <b>halogenated</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The estrogenicity of the serum from Danish controls exceeded the background in 22. 7 % of the cases, while the same was true for 68. 1 % of the Faroese samples. The increased estrogenicity response did not correlate with the lipid-based concentrations of individual suspected endocrine disruptors in the Faroese samples. When added along with the estradiol standard, an indication of an enhanced estrogenic response was found in most cases. Thus, the in vitro estrogenicity response offers a promising and feasible approach for an aggregated exposure assessment for xenoestrogens in serum. </p...|$|R

To address this challenge, we synthesized a set of shape- and size-controlled Pd nanoparticles and evaluated the activity of three probe contaminants (i. e., nitrite, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), and diatrizoate) as a function of facet type (e. g., (100), (110), (111)), ratios of low- to high-coordination sites, and ratios of surface sites to total Pd (i. e., dispersion). Reduction results for an initial contaminant concentration of 100 μM show that initial turnover frequency (TOF 0) for nitrite increases 4. 7 -fold with increasing percent of (100) surface Pd sites (from 0 % to 95. 3 %), whereas the TOF 0 for NDMA and for diatrizoate increases 4. 5 - and 3. 6 -fold, respectively, with an increasing percent of terrace surface Pd sites (from 79. 8 % to 95. 3 %). Results for an initial nitrite concentration of 2 mM show that TOF 0 is the same for all shape- and size-controlled Pd nanoparticles. Trends for TOF 0 were supported by results showing that all catalysts but one were stable in shape and size up to 12 days; for the exception, iodide liberation in diatrizoate reduction appeared to be responsible for a shape change of 4 nm octahedral Pd nanoparticles. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations for the free energy change of hydrogen (H 2), nitrite, and nitric oxide (NO) adsorption and a two-site model based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism suggest that competition of adsorbates for different Pd sites can explain the TOF 0 results.

These compounds are often of environmentally persistent nature and induce toxic effects to the wildlife {{as well as to}} human health {{and the best way to}} control these harmful gases being by destructing them into smaller fragments. At first glance, these materials have been decomposed via thermal oxidation at temperature ~ 1000 °C; in processes that are very energy intensive and may lead to the formation of the notorious dioxins compounds in post-combustion chambers. CeOz or CeOzbased materials as alternative of the expensive noble metals based material are widely used as catalysts in prominent industrial applications. Very recently, mounting experimental evidences have established robust catalytic behaviour of Ce 02 toward dechlorinating and degradation of Cl-VOCs [1, 2]. Among the various plausible terminations, Ce 02 (111) is the most stable surface involving mixed Ce/ 0 terminations. In this work, we inspected the dissociation of representative Cl-VOCs, namely chlorobenzene (C 6 H 5 Cl), chloroethane (CzH 5 Cl) and ispropyl chloride (C 3 H 7 Cl), termed as CB, CE and IC respectively, over the Ce 02 (111) surface using density functional theory (DFT). The on-site Coulomb interaction correction (DFT +U) method developed by Dudarev et al [3] was employed to produce more accurate energetic profiles of these systems. Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method [4] was used to calculate the reaction paths.

40|$|Six {{marine biota}} species were {{collected}} from the Xuande Atoll, South China Sea to investigate the bioaccumulation of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) and dechlorane plus (DP). Pike conger (Muraenesox talabonoides) had the highest concentrations of <b>halogenated</b> organic <b>pollutants</b> (HOPs) among the six marine biota species. DDTs were the predominant HOPs, followed by PCBs and PBDEs, with minor contributions of DBDPE and DP. Twenty-one percent of samples had ratios of (DDE + DDD) /Sigma DDTs lower than 0. 5, implying the presence of fresh DDT inputs in {{the environment of the}} Xuande Atoll. The biomagnification factor values for DDTs, PCBs, PBDEs and DP were higher than 1, suggesting biomagnification of these contaminants in the marine food chains. Consumption of seafood from the Xuande Atoll might not subject local residents in the coastal areas of South China to health risks as far as HOPs are concerned. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|DehIVa {{is one of}} two dehalogenases {{produced}} by the soil- and water-borne bacterium Burkholderia cepacia MBA 4. It acts to break down short-chain halogenated aliphatic acids through a nucleophilic attack and subsequent hydrolysis of an enzyme-substrate intermediate to remove the halide ions from L-enantiomers substituted at the C 2 position (e. g L- 2 -monochloropropionic acid). Dehalogenases are an important group of enzymes that are responsible for breaking down a diverse range of <b>halogenated</b> environmental <b>pollutants.</b> The dhlIVa gene coding for DehIVa was expressed in Escherichia coli and the protein was purified and crystallized using the hanging-drop method. Crystals grown in PEG 4000 and ammonium sulfate diffracted to 3. 1 Å. crystals had a primitive hexagonal unit cell, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 104. 2, c = 135. 8 Å, α = β = 90, γ = 120 °. Determining this structure will provide valuable insights into the characterization of the catalytic mechanisms of this group of enzymes. © 2005 International Union of Crystallography.

40|$|Levels of polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{are increasing}} {{in the environment}} and may cause long-term health problems in humans. The similarity in the chemical structures of PBDEs and other <b>halogenated</b> aromatic <b>pollutants</b> hints on {{the possibility that they}} might share similar toxicological effects. In this work, three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationships (3 -D-QSAR) models, using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA), were built based on calculated structural indices and a reported experimental toxicology index (aryl hydrocarbon receptor relative binding affinities, RBA) of 18 PBDEs congeners, to determine the factors required for the RBA of these HIDES. After performing leave-one-out cross-validation, satisfactory results were obtained with cross-validation Q(2) and R- 2 values of 0. 580 and 0. 995 by the CoMFA model and 0. 680 and 0. 982 by the CoMSIA model, respectively. The results showed clearly that the nonplanar conformations of PBDEs result in the lowest energy level and that the electrostatic index was the main factor reflecting the RBA of PBDEs. The two QSAR models were then used to predict the RBA value of 46 PBDEs for which experimental values are unavailable at present...|$|R
40|$|Haloalkane dehalogenases are key enzymes for the {{degradation}} of <b>halogenated</b> aliphatic <b>pollutants.</b> Two rhizobial strains, Mesorhizobium loti MAFF 303099 and Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110, have open reading frames (ORFs), mlr 5434 and blr 1087, respectively, that encode putative haloalkane dehalogenase homologues. The crude extracts of Escherichia coli strains expressing mlr 5434 and blr 1087 showed the ability to dehalogenate 18 halogenated compounds, indicating that these ORFs indeed encode haloalkane dehalogenases. Therefore, these ORFs were referred to as dmlA (dehalogenase from Mesorhizobium loti) and dbjA (dehalogenase from Bradyrhizobium japonicum), respectively. The principal component analysis of the substrate specificities of various haloalkane dehalogenases clearly showed that DbjA and DmlA constitute a novel substrate specificity class with extraordinarily high activity towards �-methylated compounds. Comparison of the circular dichroism spectra of DbjA and other dehalogenases strongly suggested that DbjA contains more �-helices than the other dehalogenases. The dehalogenase activity of resting cells and Northern blot analyses both revealed that the dmlA and dbjA genes were expressed under normal culture conditions in MAFF 303099 and USDA 110 strain cells, respectively.

40|$|Trabajo presentado a la XV Reunión científica de la Sociedad Española de Cromatografía y Técnicas Afines - SECyTA 2015. Castellón de la Plana, 27 - 30 de octubre de 2015. Gas chromatographs {{coupled to}} mass spectrometers (GC-MS) have been {{extensively}} {{applied for the}} determination of volatile and semi-volatile, non-polar, compounds in fields like food safety, environmental or toxicological studies. Most methods {{reported in the literature}} use electron ionization (EI) [1], which may result in extensive fragmentation of analytes compromising both, selectivity and sensitivity. This makes also difficult the application of tandem MS due to lack of specific/abundant precursor ions [2]. The analysis of persistent organic pollutants, including brominated flame retardants (BFRs), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs), relies on the use of methods based on GC-MS operating in EI or negative chemical ionization (NCI) modes using quadrupole, triple quadrupole, ion trap or magnetic sector analyzers [3]. These halogenated contaminants are examples of compounds for which a softer, reproducible and robust ionization technique might be favorable since they show high fragmentation in EI and low specificity in NCI [4]. In this work the potential of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) combined with GC and triple quadrupole mass analyzer has been investigated, using BFRs, PCDD/PCDF and dl-PCBs as model compounds for their determination in different complex samples, including marine samples, milk, feed and animal fat and interlaboratory studies samples. Ionization and fragmentation behavior of 14 PBDEs and 3 novel BFRs as well as 10 PCDD/PCDF and 7 dl-PCB congeners by APCI has been studied. The formation of highly abundant (quasi) molecular ions has been the main goal because of the expected improvement in specificity obtained when using it as precursor ion in tandem MS. The convenience of using modifiers for the ionization step has been studied and discussed for each family of compounds with the aim of obtaining the maximum sensitivity in combination of acceptable reproducibility and optimum specificity/selectivity. The improved detectability (LODs between 1 and 20 fg) achieved when using APCI compared to EI has been demonstrated. The application to different complex samples has shown the feasibility of the methods at trace levels for unambiguous identification and determination of the compounds investigated. These results highlight the potential of APCI as the reference for quantification of <b>halogenated</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the next years. [1] J. Cristale, J. Chromatogr. A. 1241 (2012) 1 – 12.

40|$|Plants are {{increasingly}} being employed to clean up environmental pollutants such as heavy metals; however, a major limitation of phytoremediation is the inability of plants to mineralize most organic pollutants. A key component of organic <b>pollutants</b> is <b>halogenated</b> aliphatic compounds that include 1, 2 -dichloroethane (1, 2 -DCA). Although plants lack the enzymatic activity required to metabolize this compound, two bacterial enzymes, haloalkane dehalogenase (DhlA) and haloacid dehalogenase (DhlB) from the bacterium Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ 10, {{have the ability to}} dehalogenate a range of halogenated aliphatics, including 1, 2 -DCA. We have engineered the dhlA and dhlB genes into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum ‘Xanthi’) plants and used 1, 2 -DCA as a model substrate to demonstrate the ability of the transgenic tobacco to remediate a range of halogenated, aliphatic hydrocarbons. DhlA converts 1, 2 -DCA to 2 -chloroethanol, which is then metabolized to the phytotoxic 2 -chloroacetaldehyde, then chloroacetic acid, by endogenous plant alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities, respectively. Chloroacetic acid is dehalogenated by DhlB to produce the glyoxylate cycle intermediate glycolate. Plants expressing only DhlA produced phytotoxic levels of chlorinated intermediates and died, while plants expressing DhlA together with DhlB thrived at levels of 1, 2 -DCA that were toxic to DhlA-expressing plants. This represents a significant advance {{in the development of a}} low-cost phytoremediation approach toward the clean-up of <b>halogenated</b> organic <b>pollutants</b> from contaminated soil and groundwater...|$|R

40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} distribution {{coupled with}} their carcinogenicity has raised public concerns {{on the potential}} risks to both {{human health and the}} ecosystem posed by the halogenated aromatic compounds (XAr). Recently, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been increasingly favored as an "environmentally-green" technology for the remediation of such recalcitrant and highly toxic XAr. Here, we show that AOPs-mediated degradation of the priority pollutant pentachlorophenol and all other XAr produces an intrinsic chemiluminescence that directly depends on the generation of the extremely reactive hydroxyl radicals. We propose that the hydroxyl radical-dependent formation of quinoid intermediates and electronically excited carbonyl species is responsible for this unusual chemiluminescence production. A rapid, sensitive, simple, and effective chemiluminescence method was developed to quantify trace amounts of XAr and monitor their real-time degradation kinetics. These findings may have broad biological and environmental implications for future research on this important class of <b>halogenated</b> persistent organic <b>pollutants...</b>|$|R

In order to know the level of pollutants in the samples themselves, analyses of PCDD/Fs in the materials used were made. The PCDD/F content found in pine needles was 0. 66 ng I-TEQ/kg, while for pine cones a lower value of 0. 33 ng I-TEQ/kg was obtained. In the combustion experiment a high value of dioxins and furans was obtained, 196 ng I-TEQ/kg material burnt. The homologue profiles of PCDD/Fs showed differences between the materials and the flue gas emissions.
