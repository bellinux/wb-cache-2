40|$|International {{knowledge}} spillovers, especially through multinational companies (MNCs), {{have recently}} been a major topic of academic and management debate. However, most studies treat MNC subsidiaries as relatively passive actors. We challenge this assumption by investigating the drivers of <b>knowledge</b> protection <b>intensity</b> of MNC subsidiaries. We argue that <b>knowledge</b> protection <b>intensity</b> is determined by MNC subsidiary mandates and by opportunities and risks originating from the host region. We hypothesize that not just competence-creating but also competence-exploiting mandates increase <b>knowledge</b> protection <b>intensity.</b> In addition, technological cluster regions in the host country {{can be expected to}} provide opportunities for knowledge sourcing and MNC subsidiaries may be willing to protect knowledge less intensively to participate in cluster networks. We test our hypotheses using a dataset of 694 observations of 631 MNC subsidiaries in Germany and develop recommendations for research, managers and policy makers...|$|R

40|$|The Schumpeterian view on Business cycles treats recessions as a {{cleansing}} {{mechanism and}} a state where firms can regroup and innovate. Firms need to access finance externally in order to compensate declining cash flow in recessions. Due to financial frictions, the literature proposes that firms need to post collateral in order to mitigate problems of information asymmetries. In this paper I view knowledge within a firm as a prerequisite {{for it to be}} innovative. Combining financial frictions and firm <b>knowledge</b> <b>intensity</b> the overall hypothesis of this paper is: Firms which have collateral can retain its <b>knowledge</b> <b>intensity</b> when cash flow declines. This enables firms with collateral to benefit from recessions like Schumpeter proposed. In this paper I explore the impact of firm collateral on the cyclicality of <b>knowledge</b> <b>intensity.</b> This is conducted through using firm level data on 14, 500 Swedish manufacturing firms over the period 1997 - 2004. The main results are: (i) the <b>knowledge</b> <b>intensity</b> of a firm without collateral is pro-cyclical. I. e. its share of highly educated employees is positively correlated with sales variation; (ii) on the other hand, the <b>knowledge</b> <b>intensity</b> of firms with collateral is counter-cyclical. Through retaining their <b>knowledge</b> <b>intensity</b> even as sales drops firms with collateral can benefit from recessions as Schumpeter proposed. incomplete markets; asymmetric information; business fluctuations; business cycles; corporate finance; innovation...|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} 220 {{international}} high technology strategic alliances, we question {{the extent to}} which <b>knowledge</b> transfer <b>intensity</b> between partners is monotonic (subject to ever-increasing returns) in its relationship with strategic alliance performance.

As an extension to this, we observe that these effects are moderated by relational exchange conditions (trust and relationship commitment) between alliance partners, although not always in the hypothesized direction. Finally, we identify non-linear relationships between both knowledge generation and knowledge application, and strategic alliance performance but find that these are specified in different directions. Our findings point to the complex and varied effects of different types of knowledge transfer on strategic alliance performance...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the European Union strategy to secure competitiveness for Europe in the globalising world by focussing on technological supremacy (the Lisbon - agenda). Parallel to that, the EU Commission is trying {{to take a more}} economic approach to competition policy in general and anti-trust policy in particular. Our analysis tries to establish the relationship between increasing <b>knowledge</b> <b>intensity</b> and the resulting market concentration: if the European Union economy is gradually shifting to a pattern of sectoral specialisation that features a bias on knowledge intensive sectors, then this may well have some influence on market concentration and competition policy would have to adjust not to counterfeit the Lisbon-agenda. Following a review of the available theoretical and empirical literature on the relationship between <b>knowledge</b> <b>intensity</b> and market structure, we use a larger Eurostat database to test the shape of this relationship. Assuming a causality that runs from knowledge to concentration, we show that the relationship between <b>knowledge</b> <b>intensity</b> and market structures is in fact different for knowledge intensive industries and we establish a non-linear, inverted U-curve shape. market structure, <b>knowledge</b> <b>intensity,</b> competition policy...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{innovation}} from a knowledge-based view by exploring the effect of knowledge processes and <b>knowledge</b> <b>intensity</b> on innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach – First, a theoretical model of the connections between knowledge processes, <b>knowledge</b> <b>intensity</b> and innovation performance is presented. The posited hypotheses are then tested statistically, using a survey dataset of 221 organizations. Findings – The result shows that while all knowledge processes have a beneficial impact on innovation, knowledge creation impacts innovation the most and fully mediates the impact of knowledge documentation, intra-organizational knowledge sharing and external knowledge acquisition on innovation performance. Furthermore, <b>knowledge</b> <b>intensity</b> increases all knowledge processes. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>intensity</b> also moderates the relationship of documentation and knowledge sharing with knowledge creation. The interaction effect is negative, meaning that firms in less knowledge-intensive conditions will benefit more from documentation and knowledge sharing for their knowledge creation purposes, and ultimately innovation. Research limitations – The data are limited to companies from Finland, Russia and China. Practical implications – To promote innovation, managers should pay close attention to knowledge creation processes in organizations. Furthermore, knowledge creation can be facilitated by ensuring efficient documentation procedures, and internal and external knowledge sharing and acquisition practices. Documentation and knowledge sharing are especially effective means to promote knowledge creation for non-knowledge intensive firms. Originality/value – This paper makes a contribution to the existing literature by building and testing a knowledge-based model of firm innovation and articulating the inter-relations of knowledge processes and <b>knowledge</b> <b>intensity</b> with innovation performance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a methodology for the automatic segmentation of rock-scenes {{using a combination}} of range and intensity vision. A major problem in rock scene segmentation is the effect of noise in the form of surface texture and color density variations, which causes spurious segmentations. We show that these problems can be avoided through pre-attentive range image segmentation followed by focused attention to edges. The segmentation process is inspired by the Human Visual System’s operation of using a priori knowledge from pre-attentive vision for focused attention detail. The result is good rock detection and boundary accuracy that can be attributed to independence of range data to texture and color density variations, and <b>knowledge</b> driven <b>intensity</b> edge detection respectively. Preliminary results on a limited image dataset are promising. Key words: surface texture, color density variations, range image segmentation, intensity edge detection...|$|R
