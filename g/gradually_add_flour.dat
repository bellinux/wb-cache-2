40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>added</b> pumpkin <b>flour</b> (1 - 10 g/ 100 g) on sensory and textural quality of rice bread was studied on rice biologically leavened rice bread. Specific volume, baking loss, crumb springiness, {{cohesiveness}} and resilience decreased with increasing amount of pumpkin flour. The opposite trend {{was found in}} crumb hardness and chewiness. Color measurements revealed that the lightness decreased and the greenness increased with increasing amount of pumpkin flour. Bread crumb and crust characteristics were not significantly impacted {{by the amount of}} <b>added</b> pumpkin <b>flour.</b> Additionally, the bread taste and flavor were decreased in breads with 8 - 10 g/ 100 g of <b>added</b> pumpkin <b>flour,</b> resulting in their lower overall acceptability. Weak impact of <b>added</b> pumpkin <b>flour</b> on sensory evaluation of rice bread may be related to a reduced amount of the panelists involved in this study.
