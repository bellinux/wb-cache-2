40|$|In this {{experiment}} we investigated {{the impact of}} various levels of train automation on <b>driver</b> <b>vigilance.</b> Forty student participants were trained to drive a low physical and geo-specific fidelity computer simulated passenger train on an intercity route. Vigilance task performance was measured as the track distance between the train and a safety critical event {{at the point where}} emergency braking commenced. The vigilance measure was obtained while manipulating two IVs: (1) between-subjects variable - Level-Of-Automation (LOA), being either a Nil, low, intermediate, or high level of train automation; and (2) within-subjects variable - time-on-task, having two levels: safety critical event onset before 10 minutes (Early) and after 60 minutes (Late) of driving. Arail signal failurewas used as the safety critical event to be detected. Results revealed mean <b>driver</b> <b>vigilance</b> was poorest at the high level of train automation (auto-pilot). A trend of increased vigilance was apparent among participants in the low LOA group (equipped with in-cab signalling), when compared to the nil LOA group (manual). The vigilance of participants in the intermediate LOA group (equipped with in-cab signalling and over-speed intervention) was comparable to that of those in the nil LOA group. A trend emerged for a time-on-task related vigilance decrement for the auto-pilot train drivers only.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the impact of: (1) four Levels Of Automation (LOAs) on <b>driver</b> <b>vigilance,</b> (2) two vigilance device types on driver mental workload, at two LOAs, and (3) two vigilance device types on <b>driver</b> <b>vigilance,</b> at two LOAs. In experiment 1, student participants drove a train simulator with one of four levels of automation: manual (nil), in-cab signalling (low), ATP (medium), and an autopilot (high). Results revealed that <b>driver</b> <b>vigilance</b> was negatively impacted by train automation, but only {{at a high level}} (i. e., an autopilot). This finding was interpreted as relating to driver mental workload. That is, a high LOA may have resulted in drivers being mentally underloaded. This interpretation required empirical validation in the following two experiments. In experiment 2, the task demands of participants in two high LOA groups (suspected of being mentally underloaded) were increased to one of two levels by means of a secondary task. Participants in two low LOA groups had the same treatments, and served as comparison groups. The secondary task was either a sensory vigilance device (low additional task demands) or a cognitive vigilance device (high additional task demands). Results revealed that autopilot supervisor (high LOA) participants were indeed underloaded, even with the sensory vigilance device secondary task. However, autopilot supervisor participants with the cognitive vigilance device secondary task were not underloaded. On the other hand, the in-cab signalling (low LOA) group of participants appeared to be overloaded when concurrently operating the cognitive vigilance device, but not when operating the sensory vigilance device. In experiment 3, the negative impact of a high LOA on <b>driver</b> <b>vigilance</b> was predicted to be counteracted by the additional (high) task demands of the cognitive vigilance device, but not the additional (low) task demands of the sensory vigilance device. This prediction was supported by the results in terms of the cognitive vigilance device. However, the sensory vigilance device also counteracted the negative impact of a high LOA. An explanation for this was in terms of a startling effect of the sensory vigilance device, rather than it being due to increased task demands. Future studies were suggested that could determine if mental overload still occurs when a verbal/auditory, and/or a task-linked, version of the cognitive vigilance device is used...|$|E

40|$|Drivers ' {{ability to}} react to {{unpredictable}} events deteriorates when exposed to highly predictable and uneventful driving tasks. Particularly, highway design reduces the driving task mainly to a lane-keeping one. It contributes to hypovigilance and road crashes as drivers are often not aware that their driving behaviour is impaired. Monotony increases fatigue, however, the fatigue community has mainly focused on endogenous factors leading to fatigue such as sleep deprivation. This paper focuses on the exogenous factor monotony which contributes to hypovigilance. Objective measurements {{of the effects of}} monotonous driving conditions on the driver and the vehicle's dynamics is systematically reviewed with the aim of justifying the relevance of the need for a mathematical framework that could predict hypovigilance in real-time.

A visual system for automatic <b>driver</b> <b>vigilance</b> has to address two fundamental problems.

30|$|The {{literature}} regroups {{three categories}} of safety systems distinguished {{by the type of}} signals used to determine the <b>driver</b> <b>vigilance</b> level. (i) Studying physiological signals consists on measuring signal changes represented by brain waves or heart rate using special sensors such as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) [2]. Only few works are proposed in this category since the process is highly intrusive because of the necessity to connect sensing electrodes to the driver body. (ii) Monitoring vehicle signals can reveal abnormal driver actions indirectly, by studying several parameters such as vehicle velocity changes, steering wheel motion, lateral position, or lane changes. Some commercial systems already use these techniques since the signals are significant and their acquisition is quite easy compared to the previous category. Mercedes-Benz proposes in 2009 a commercial system named “Attention Assist” based on sensitive sensors allowing precise monitoring of the steering wheel movements and the steering speed. The system is active at 80 – 180 km/h and calculates an individual behavioral pattern during the first minutes of each trip. Audible and visual signals are emitted when typical indicators of hypovigilance are detected. The major disadvantages of such system are the limitations caused by the dependence to vehicle type, driver experience, and road conditions. (iii) Approaches based on physical signals utilize image processing techniques to measure the <b>driver</b> <b>vigilance</b> level reflected through the driver’s face appearance and head/facial feature activity. These techniques are based principally on studying facial features, especially eye state [3 – 5], head pose [6, 7], or mouth state [8]. According to the study performed in [9], monitoring driver eye closure and head pose are the most relevant indicators of hypovigilance. Different kinds of cameras have been used for such systems: visible spectrum (VS) camera [10], infrared (IR) camera [11], stereo cameras [12], and also the Kinect sensor [13]. The Kinect sensor provides color images, IR images, and 3 D information. However, this sensor is not very adapted to the real driving conditions since it is designed for indoor use and it is conceived to be placed in a minimal distance of 1.8 m from the target. The IR camera is adapted when driving at night, but it is not recommended when driving at daylight conditions, since the acquisition will suffer from color distortion. The VS camera is the cheapest one, and it provides robust acquisition even if the light is reduced. However, it is a big challenge to monitor the <b>driver</b> <b>vigilance</b> level using a single VS camera without depth information and IR information.|$|E
30|$|The {{increasing}} number of traffic accidents {{in the last years}} becomes a serious problem. The enhancement of traffic safety is a high-priority task for different government agencies over the world such as “National Transportation Safety Administration” (NTSA) in USA and “Observatoire National Interministériel de la Sécurité Routière” (ONISR) in France. In addition, automotive manufactures and researcher laboratories are also contributing to this important mission. Some preventive systems such as alcohol test and speed measurement radar are deployed {{to reduce the number of}} traffic accidents, but it is obvious that hypovigilance remains one of the most principal causes. In fact, hypovigilance is responsible for 20 – 30 % of road deaths and this statistic reaches 40 – 50 % in particular crash types, such as fatal single vehicle semi-trailer crashes [1]. Moreover, there are no standard rules to measure the <b>driver</b> <b>vigilance</b> level; the unique solution is to observe the signs. The first hypovigilance signs are itchy eyes, neck stiffness, back pain, yawning, difficulty to stabilize speed and to maintain trajectory, frequent position changes, and inattention to environment (road signs, pedestrian). Fatigue, sleep deprivation, soporific drugs, driving more than 2 h without break, and driving in a monotone road are the main causes of hypovigilance. The appropriate reactions when those signs appear are to stop driving immediately and take a break, but unfortunately, the drivers are not aware of their vigilance level and overestimate it. For this purpose, several studies have been conducted to develop intelligent systems for continuously estimating <b>driver</b> <b>vigilance</b> level and emitting visual and acoustic alarms to avert the driver against abnormal state. The warning signals could also activate the vibration of driver’s seat or even a mechanism that stops the car at the roadside.|$|E

A survey of automatic affect detection methods [4] identified various types of signals (video, EKG, EMG...) used in affect analysis. Video observation and face analysis usually require high-quality image and are applicable to single-person observation, which limits their usability or reduces accuracy and available complexity of image analysis [1] in the classroom setting. Eye tracking devices are very successful in measuring affective parameters such as concentration in the computerized learning environments, and Bixler et al. were using eye tracking data detect mind wandering during computerized reading [19]. Apart from visual signals, other types of measurements such as brainwaves (EEG) were utilized to assess attention level of students [12, 20].|$|R

Hardware/software co-design and dynamic partitioning allow the optimization of the multiprocessor platform design parameters and software code targeting each core to meet real time constraints. This is practically demonstrated by building a real life <b>driver</b> <b>vigilance</b> monitoring system based on visual cues extraction and evaluation.
