5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} distal (far) end. There are three <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but the distal end is narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E
5|$|Although {{scientists}} began observing reduced {{populations of}} several European amphibian species {{already in the}} 1950s, awareness of the phenomenon as a global problem and its subsequent classification as a modern-day mass extinction only dates from the 1980s. By 1993, more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline. Today, the phenomenon of declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems and is thus {{recognized as one of}} the most severe <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holocene extinction, with severe implications for global biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} human serpins perform {{extracellular}} roles, inhibiting proteases {{in the bloodstream}} in order to modulate their activities. For example, extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases, they can also affect development. The table of human serpins (below) provides <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range of functions performed by human serpin, {{as well as some}} of the diseases that result from serpin deficiency.|$|E
