5|$|In August 1922, Tosa {{was moved}} to Kure, still incomplete. Fifty {{thousand}} people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats. The barbettes for the 406mm (16inch) guns were in place, but no turrets or weapons had been mounted, so {{the holes in the}} main deck were covered with a mesh-like material. Her hull was finished, and a superstructure deck, bridge deck and conning tower had been fitted, along with a light signal mast directly aft of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and bridge wings. An <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe</b> resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{operated}} the controls at the bows of the gondola, {{forward of the}} engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000–1,200rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe,</b> below {{the rear of the}} gondola, was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of steel tubing that was designed to protect the gondola and the propellers during landing.|$|E
5|$|The {{victims were}} gassed with diesel exhaust {{from the engine}} of a Red Army tank. SS-Scharführer Erich Fuchs was {{responsible}} for installing it. The engine was brought in by the SS {{at the time of}} the camp's construction and housed in a room with a generator that supplied the camp with electricity. The tank engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe</b> ran just below the ground and opened into all three gas chambers. The fumes could be seen seeping out. After about 20 minutes the bodies were removed by dozens of Sonderkommandos, placed onto carts and wheeled away. The system was imperfect and required a lot of effort; trains that arrived later in the day had to wait on layover tracks overnight at Treblinka, Małkinia, or Wólka Okrąglik.|$|E
50|$|The {{section of}} tubing between the {{catalytic}} converter(s) and the rear muffler on cars that have two parallel <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes.</b> Performance mid-pipes {{often have a}} perpendicular connecting pipe or the pipes temporarily merge.

5|$|Hamilton {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, edging out Rosberg by almost seven-tenths of a second. Rosberg's running was limited as he coasted to a halt on track with twenty minutes of the session left to go due to losing drive. Ferrari was not {{competitive}} in eighth and thirteenth place for Vettel and Räikkönen respectively, with both cars suffering from problems with their energy recovery unit. The top five cars were powered by Mercedes, as Sergio Pérez led the charge behind Mercedes in third, ahead of Bottas and Nico Hülkenberg. Fernando Alonso managed eleventh place, but had to spend considerable time in the garage while his team worked on his car. Marcus Ericsson also had limited track time as a problem with his <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe</b> forced him to miss {{the early part of}} the session. With loose kerbs detected during the GP2 qualifying session, drivers were instructed to stay clear of the kerbs at turn 6. Once more, many drivers had minor incidents on track, with some having to take to the run-off area at turn 3, while Gutiérrez touched the barrier at turn 8. Carlos Sainz Jr. spun at the first corner, but nevertheless finished the session in sixth, the fastest runner without a Mercedes power unit.|$|E

Redesign of vehicles exhaust system from previously rounded muffler with long <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe</b> into rectangular muffler with short <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe.</b> Reduction of side windows in troop compartment from 4 for each side into 3. Modification of troop compartment featuring individual roof/wall mounted blast protection seat for 8 troops. Some vehicle also fitted with camera featuring night-vision capabilities at the front of the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The boiler had {{a simple}} single flue, with the chimney exiting through {{the upper part}} of the boiler drum. This was not a smokebox as such, as there was no smokebox door for access and cleaning. A {{prominent}} external <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe</b> ahead of the boiler led to a blastpipe within the chimney.|$|E

A refreshened 2010 model was released on 16 December 2009 that incorporated new 7 split-spoke alloy wheels, LED taillights, rectangular <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe</b> designs, new side mirrors, redesigned headlights, and new front fascia and grille. New interior amenities include Alcantara leather seats and rear passenger audio and climate controls.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation found}} that a fuel pressure pipe had chafed against a metal clip, causing the pipe to leak aviation spirit. This fuel was then ignited, probably by a hot <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe.</b> The fuel pipe would then have been burnt away, which would have caused fuel starvation to the No. 1 (outer port) engine. With the port wing on fire and both port engines out of action, the aircraft would have been increasingly difficult to control.|$|E
25|$|Older {{stations}} {{tend to use}} {{a separate}} pipe for every kind of available fuel and for every dispenser. Newer stations may employ a single pipe for every dispenser. This pipe houses a number of smaller pipes for the individual fuel types. Fuel tanks, dispenser and nozzles used to fill car tanks employ vapor recovery systems, which prevents releases of vapor into the atmosphere with a system of pipes. The exhausts are placed as high as possible. A vapor recovery system may be employed at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe.</b> This system collects the vapors, liquifies them and releases {{them back into the}} lowest grade fuel tank available.|$|E

25|$|As income increased, {{the company}} {{invested}} in {{new technology and}} modernization, upgrading computers in 3-D planning of configurations, programming of tools and computer-aided manufacture. In 2004, the company made its first contact with automobile industry and in 2007 developed and equipped an exhaust system for a Formula 1 race car. In 2007, the company changed its logo. Akrapovič is now active as a supplier in the Porsche Sport Cup, where Porsche cars compete at six fully licensed and unlicensed series. In April 2007, the company was awarded the Best <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Pipe</b> Manufacturer Award from German Motorrad magazine, winning 42% of the votes. The company has since won the Best Brand award in every subsequent year with 2011 by its highest ever margin of votes.|$|E
25|$|The K200 {{series of}} {{vehicles}} transport mechanized infantry platoon {{is designed to}} keep personnel safe from small arms fire. The hull of the KIFV is of all-welded aluminium armour with an additional layer of spaced laminate steel armour bolted to it. This composite armour provides {{a higher level of}} protection for less weight. It can protect against 12.7mm on the side and 7.62mm on the rear, and against anti-personnel mines. The engine compartment is located at the front right of the vehicle and is separated from the remainder of the vehicle by a bulkhead. The engine compartment is fitted with a fire extinguishing system that can be operated by the driver or from outside the vehicle. The air inlet, air outlet louvres and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe</b> are located {{on the roof of the}} vehicle to allow amphibious operations.|$|E
25|$|In {{petrol engine}} {{turbocharger}} applications, boost pressure {{is limited to}} keep the entire engine system, including the turbocharger, inside its thermal and mechanical design operating range. Over-boosting an engine frequently causes damage to the engine {{in a variety of}} ways including pre-ignition, overheating, and over-stressing the engine's internal hardware. For example, to avoid engine knocking (also known as detonation) and the related physical damage to the engine, the intake manifold pressure must not get too high, thus the pressure at the intake manifold of the engine must be controlled by some means. Opening the wastegate allows the excess energy destined for the turbine to bypass it and pass directly to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe,</b> thus reducing boost pressure. The wastegate can be either controlled manually (frequently seen in aircraft) or by an actuator (in automotive applications, it is often controlled by the engine control unit).|$|E
