5|$|Lydiard {{remained}} cruising off Havana, and on 15 September sighted the French 84-gun Foudroyant. The Foudroyant, {{carrying the}} flag of Vice-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, had been dismasted in a storm and was carrying a jury-rig. Despite the superiority of his opponent and the nearness of the shore Lydiard attempted to close on the French vessel and opened fire. Anson came under fire from the fortifications at Morro Castle, while several Spanish ships, including the 74-gun San Lorenzo, came out of Havana to assist the French. After being unable to manoeuvre into a favourable position and coming under heavy fire, Lydiard <b>hauled</b> <b>away</b> and made his escape. Anson had two killed and 13 wounded during the engagement, while the rigging was badly cut. Foudroyant meanwhile had 27 killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|In the First Battle of Gaza in March 1917, Chauvel's {{mission was}} similar to Rafa and Magdhaba, but on a larger scale. He enveloped the Turkish {{position}} at Gaza while the British 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division and 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division attempted to capture it. When this failed, Chetwode ordered Chauvel to attempt to capture Gaza from the rear. Chauvel successfully improvised a late afternoon assault on Gaza that captured the town despite the barriers of high cactus hedges and fierce enemy opposition, entering it after dark, only to have an out-of-touch Dobell order the mounted troops to withdraw, despite Chauvel's protests. This time his brigadiers at the front, Generals Ryrie and Chaytor, although they believed that Gaza could be held, felt compelled to obey, as they {{could not see the}} whole battle. All guns, including captured ones were <b>hauled</b> <b>away,</b> as were all unwounded prisoners, the wounded and even the dead. Chauvel ensured that wounded Turkish prisoners that were unfit to make the march to Deir al-Balah were each left with a full water bottle.|$|E
5|$|After the Dissolution, {{two of the}} abbey's manors in Wiltshire {{were sold}} by the Crown to John Thynne and {{thereafter}} descended in his family, who much later became Marquesses of Bath. The Thynnes have preserved many of the abbey's Wiltshire records at Longleat {{up to the present}} day. The ruins of the abbey itself was stripped of lead and dressed stones <b>hauled</b> <b>away</b> to be used in other buildings. The site was granted by Edward VI to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset who established a colony of Protestant Dutch weavers on the site. When Seymour was attainted in 1551, the abbey site reverted to the crown, but the weavers remained until they were removed in the reign of Queen Mary. In 1559 Elizabeth I of England granted the site to Peter Carew, and it remained in private ownership until the beginning of the 20th century. Further stones were removed in the 17th century, so that {{by the beginning of the}} 18th century the abbey was described as a ruin. The only building to survive intact is the Abbot's Kitchen, which served as a Quaker meeting house. Early in the 19th century, gunpowder was used to dislodge further stones and the site became a quarry. The Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 stopped further damage to the site and led to the first historical and archaeological surveys.|$|E

25|$|The next morning, 20 October 1805, {{a strange}} sail was {{reported}} off {{the entrance to}} the harbour. Prowse asked for and was given permission by Blackwood to investigate, and closed on the stranger. By the time this had been achieved the 74-gun Héros had come within range and opened fire. Sirius nevertheless stopped the stranger with a shot across her bow and sent an officer over to inspect her. It was determined that the ship in question was a neutral American merchant, and she was allowed to continue on her way. Prowse recovered the boat and <b>hauled</b> <b>away</b> from the French warship. The entire combined fleet had finally put to sea by 10 a.m., whereupon a burst of rainy squalls caused the frigates to lose sight of it until midday.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only did}} the Romans have the {{advantage}} of total surprise and numbers (40 Carthaginian against 55 Roman and Massalian ships), but the combat effectiveness of the Carthaginians is not reflected in the number of ships as one-quarter of their fleet had newly trained crew. The Romans formed 2 lines with the 35 Roman ships in front and the 20 Massalian ships behind them, with the formation and the naval skill of the Massalians nullifying the superior manoeuvrability of the Carthaginian fleet. The Romans engaged the Carthaginian ships as they came out of the river, ramming and sinking four of them and boarding and capturing two more. The Carthaginian crews then lost heart, beached their ships and sought safety among the army. The Romans grappled and <b>hauled</b> <b>away</b> 23 of the beached ships.|$|E
25|$|When the Terminal's train shed {{was torn}} down in 1968, it was dismantled, not demolished. The {{structural}} steel girder sections were numbered and removed {{to the site}} of the Indiana Museum of Transport and Communication (known today as the Indiana Transportation Museum) in Forest Park, located in Noblesville, Indiana. The $10,500 cost for that portion of the project was almost entirely financed (all but $500) by a donation from Ruth Lilly, and the original goal was to eventually reassemble the shed and use it to shelter the museum's existing and future railroad equipment collection. An adjoining two-story office and waiting room was envisioned, which was to include a scaled down replica of the terminal's original waiting room. However, the plan languished due to the prohibitive projected cost of its reconstruction. The stacked girders remained untouched until the early 1980s, when they were finally <b>hauled</b> <b>away</b> as scrap.|$|E

25|$|In 1971 a magnitude-6.6 {{earthquake}} in San Fernando caused some {{damage to the}} Caltech campus. Engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating {{from the early days}} of the Institute—Throop Hall and the Goodhue-designed Culbertson Auditorium—had cracked. These were some of the first reinforced concrete buildings, and their plans did not contain enough details (such as how much reinforcing bar had been embedded in the concrete) to be sure they were safe, so the engineers recommended demolition. However, demolishing these historic structures required considerably more effort than would have been necessary had they been in real danger of collapse. A large wrecking ball was used to demolish Throop Hall, and smashing the concrete revealed massive amounts of rebar, far in excess of safety requirements. The rebar had to be cut up before the pieces could be <b>hauled</b> <b>away,</b> and the process took much longer than expected.|$|E
25|$|After the Lady Be Good was identified, {{parts of}} the plane were {{returned}} to the United States for evaluation. Some parts may be seen today at the National Museum of the United States Air Force. A propeller {{can be seen in}} front of the village hall in Lake Linden, the home of Robert E. LaMotte. The U.S. Army Quartermaster Museum at Fort Lee, Virginia has a collection of personal items, such as watches, silk survival maps, and flight clothing from the crew members who were recovered. Several of these items are on display. An altimeter and manifold pressure gauge were salvaged from the plane in 1963 by Airman Second Class Ron Pike and are on display at the March Field Air Museum just south of Riverside, CA. A Royal Air Force team visited the site in 1968 and <b>hauled</b> <b>away</b> components including an engine (later donated to the US Air Force) for evaluation by the McDonnell Douglas company. Other pieces were stripped by souvenir hunters over the years. In August 1994, the remains of the craft were recovered by a team led by Dr. Fadel Ali Mohammed and taken to a Libyan military base in Tobruk for safekeeping. They are now stored at Jamal Abdelnasser Air Force Base, Libya.|$|E

According to Georgian first deputy defence minister Batu Kutelia, Georgia needed a complex, multi-layered air-defence system to protect its airspace. However, Western military officers experienced with Georgian military forces suggested that Georgia's military shortcomings were too great to be eliminated by new equipment acquisitions. According to a 2 September 2008 New York Times article, [...] "Georgia's Army fled ahead of the Russian Army's advance, turning its back and leaving Georgian civilians in an enemy's path.
