40|$|This report {{describes}} a decision-making tool {{that has been}} developed {{for the purposes of}} guiding resource allocation by RDAFCW and should be read in conjunction with the Central Queensland Regional Roadmap. Successful and sustainable regional development is complex, particularly in regions such as Central Queensland, which is at once geographically large, demographically diverse, and experiencing a range of multi-disciplinary and cumulative impacts. RDAFCW’s Regional Roadmap already provides for strong direction in terms of regional development activities for Central Queensland. However, what is still lacking in the RDAFCW ‘toolbox’ is a method by which the committee (and the executive officer) can determine the overall merit of offering support to one project over another, given the matrix of RDAFCW’s roles, capabilities, resources and strategic relationships. Following a review of the operations of RDAFCW and the policy environment across the three tiers of government, a new methodology for decision-making on regional projects has been developed. This model was informed by a range of existing approaches already used for regional development and decision-making (as summarised in Appendix A). The “DRIVE” tool is based on 5 x 3 model, with 5 key criteria each having a triplet of three evaluation questions to answer. The key criteria are: •	Delivery of the Regional Roadmap •	Reflecting on policy cohesion •	Investing for regional benefit •	Varying activities achieve equity and •	Evaluating uncertainties. The DRIVE model is simple; can be applied to any nature of project; and it does not require particularly detailed information from proponents. It places no particular emphasis on any given economic sector; nor does treat economic, social, or environmental benefits differently. However, the model is constrained by a high degree of subjectivity; its relatively simplistic design; and the particular challenge of evaluating policy-based criteria when the policy landscape remains quite fluid. Further refinements may be made to the model following pilot testing with RDAFCW, and circulation amongst the wider regional development and academic communities. Finally, {{it is very important to}} note that, in its current architecture, the <b>DRIVE</b> <b>tool</b> is very closely linked with Regional Roadmap.

Aggression variation between drivers can increase fuel consumption by more than 50 % or decrease it by more than 20 % from average. The normalized fuel consumption deviation from average {{as a function of}} population percentile was found to be largely insensitive to powertrain. However, the traits of ideal driving behavior are a function of powertrain. In conventional vehicles, kinetic losses dominate rolling resistance and aerodynamic losses. In xEVs with regenerative braking, rolling resistance and aerodynamic losses dominate. The relation of fuel consumption predicted from real-world drive data to that predicted by the industry-standard HWFET, UDDS, LA 92, and US 06 drive cycles was not consistent across powertrains, and varied broadly from the mean, median, and mode of real-world driving.

Boat-based photo-identification surveys on dolphin groups were conducted in each austral winter (April-September) between 2007 and 2010 along ten transect lines.

40|$|Abstract. A {{degradation}} of heating efficiency was observed during high-harmonic fast wave (HHFW) heating of spherical tokamak plasmas when parametric decay instability (PDI) occurred. Suppression of PDI {{is necessary to}} make HHFW a reliable heating and current <b>drive</b> <b>tool</b> in high β plasmas. In order to understand PDI, measurements were made using a radially movable electrostatic probe (ion saturation current and floating potential), arrays of RF magnetic probes distributed both toroidally and poloidally, microwave reflectometry, and fast optical diagnostics in TST- 2. The frequency spectrum usually exhibits ion-cyclotron harmonic sidebands f 0 ± nfci and low-frequency ion-cyclotron quasi-modes (ICQM) nfci. PDI becomes stronger at lower densities, and much weaker when the plasma is {{far away from the}} antenna. The lower sideband power was found to increase quadratically with the local pump wave power. The lower sideband power relative to the local pump wave power was larger for reflectometer compared to either electrostatic or magnetic probes. The radial decay of the pump wave amplitude in the SOL was much faster for the ion saturation current than for the floating potential. These results are consistent with the HHFW pump wave decaying into the HHFW or ion Bernstein wave (IBW) sideband and the low-frequency ion-cyclotron quasi-mode (ICQM). Two additional peaks were discovered between the fundamental lower sideband and the pump wave in hydrogen plasmas. The frequency differences of these peaks from the pump wave increase with the magnetic field. These decay modes may involve molecular ions or partially ionized impurity ions. 1...|$|E
40|$|In tokamak plasmas with {{multiple}} ion species, fast magnetosonic waves (FW) in the Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequency can mode convert to shorter wavelength modes at the Ion-Ion hybrid layer, leading to localized electron heating and current drive. Due to k 1 l upshifts {{associated with the}} poloidal magnetic field, only small net driven currents were predicted from mode converted Ion Bernstein Waves (IBW). As studied first by Perkins, and later confirmed experimentally with Phase Contrast Imaging measurements on Alcator C-Mod, poloidal field effects {{can also lead to}} mode conversion to Ion Cyclotron Waves (MCICW), on the low field side of the mode conversion layer. In this thesis, mode conversion current drive in the ICW-dominated regime is studied numerically and through experiments on Alcator C-Mod. Solving a dispersion relation for the mode converted waves in a slab geometry relevant to tokamak equilibria and in the finite Larmor radius limit, we find that mode conversion to Ion Cyclotron Waves is ubiquitous to high temperature conventional tokamaks, {{as a result of the}} central value for the safety factor qo 1. MCICWs are identified as kinetically modified Ion Cyclotron Waves in the regime w/kllVthe < 1. Full wave simulations with the TORIC code predict net currents can be driven by MCICW as a result of up-down asymmetries in the mode conversion process. Initial estimates with the Ehst-Karney parametrization indicated up to [...] 100 kA could be driven for 3 MW input power in C-Mod plasmas. More accurate calculations, consistent with the polarization of MCICWs, were carried out by importing a quasilinear diffusion operator build from the TORIC fields in the Fokker-Planck code DKE, and predicted lower current drive efficiencies by a factor of 2. (cont.) The TFTR discharges in 1996 where net MCCD currents were inferred experimentally from loop voltage differences were simulated with TORIC, which indicates mode conversion to ICW can account for the driven currents. Similar loop voltage experiments in D(3 He) plasmas were attempted on Alcator C-Mod, but did not yield conclusive current drive measurements. The lack of control over Zeff in C-Mod, which is illustrative of ICRF operation in tokamaks with metallic walls, makes reaching optimal plasma conditions for MCCD difficult, and limits the range of parameters in which MCCD can be useful as a net current <b>drive</b> <b>tool</b> in C-Mod. Solving the current diffusion equation in the cylindrical limit and with sawtooth reconnection models, the large sawtooth oscillations in C-Mod plasmas were also found to complicate current relaxation and hinder the loop voltage analysis for small central driven currents inside the q = 1 surface. In separate experiments on Alcator C-Mod, sawtooth period changes were used to infer localized MCCD near the q = 1 surface. The mode conversion layer was swept outward through the q = 1 surface in D(3 He) plasmas, and the sawtooth period was found to vary from 3 to 12 ms, which is consistent wih localized current drive and TORIC predictions. A similar evolution was found in heating and co-current drive phasing, which suggests net currents are driven with a symmetric antenna spectrum, as predicted by TORIC as a result of asymmetries in the mode conversion process. Simulations of the sawtooth cycle with the Porcelli trigger model indicate that TORIC currents can account for the sawtooth period evolution in heating phasing. (cont.) Based on simulations of the saw-tooth cycle with the Porcelli trigger model, localized electron heating, which could also explain the experimental results, was found not to be dominant compared to the current drive effect. The experimental results demonstrate that, while not optimal, MCCD can be used for sawtooth control. by Alexandre Parisot. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The most {{challenging}} conceptual problem of thermonuclear energy research based on deuterium plasmas magnetically trapped in toroidal machines, named tokamaks, consists {{in how to}} control and actively shape during operations the current density radial profile of plasma column. To achieve this control is of paramount importance, indeed, for the following reasons: i) to prevent the onset of unstable modes that detriment the figures of stability and fusion power gain from thermonuclear reactions, which are necessary for a reactor; ii) to remove the obstacle of tokamaks of being intrinsically inductive machines, i. e., capable of producing only transient plasma regimes, {{in front of the}} reactor’s need of operating in steady- state. In regard to the former problem, data of modelling and experiments available in the last 25 years showed that the growth rate of pernicious unstable plasma modes, of magneto-hydro-dynamic (MHD) nature, is strongly depressed when a relative maximum of the plasma current density is suitably located at radii close to the region that interests the unstable modes. They make challenging the possibility of achieving the desired thermal insulation that is necessary for allowing thermonuclear conditions of high temperatures (∼ 100 million of degrees) and high density (∼ 1020 m- 3) of plasma. The limitation of pulsed operation was, instead, well known since the assessment (half century ago) of the tokamak concept, and this was soon perceived as the major conceptual obstacle against the development of a thermonuclear fusion reactor. Indeed, at that time, the further problem of the onset of unstable modes (which produces anomalous transport effects, on heat and matter, via micro-turbulence and MHD modes) did not appear yet. The discovery in 1981 at Princeton (USA) of the lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) effect was considered very attractive for facing both the mentioned major problems of a reactor. The LHCD effect consists in the capability of multimegawatt microwave power at several gigahertz, coupled to quasi-electrostatic natural modes of plasma, named lower hybrid (LH) waves, of non- inductively producing current in tokamak plasma. Consequently, the plasma current can flow with continuity in a tokamak under RF power injection. The antenna consists in phased arrays of rectangular waveguides that suitably fit the gaps of the tokamak’s magnet. Via electronic setting of the waveguide phasing, the refractive index (n//, in the direction parallel to the confinement magnetic field) of the RF power spectrum can be usefully determined in order to Landau-resonate with a tail of the electron distribution of plasma electrons, for the temperature that corresponds to the radial layer where the current drive effect would be desirably produced. As further support of attractiveness of the LHCD effect, it should be considered that other methods utilising radiofrequency power in the ion-cyclotron and electron-cyclotron resonant frequencies, as well those that exploit strong power injection of energetic ion beams, present much lower efficiency in driving plasma current than that possible by the LHCD effect. Unfortunately, for long time the LHCD effect was observed to occur successfully only when operating at too low plasma densities – of about a factor three lower than that required by reactor – despite of the many attempts carried out for decades in many laboratories in the world. In these experiments, the RF power was however successfully coupled by the antenna, but remained unexpectedly deposited at the plasma periphery, as a consequence of parasitic effects of plasma edge. Only recently, an original research performed in the ENEA-Frascati Lab. – whose results have been published on Nature Communications: 5, 55, 2010 – has assessed a new method for enabling the occurrence of the LHCD effect at reactor graded high plasma densities. This method is based on previous theoretical predictions of reduced parasitic effect under higher temperature of plasma edge (ENEA Laboratory work published on Physical Review Letters in 2004). These works demonstrated that the parasitic damping of the coupled RF power is produced by non-linear wave-plasma interaction, named parametric instability (PI), which is capable of strongly altering (namely, broadening) the n// spectrum launched by the antenna. Consequently, the temperature required for Landau-resonance of the RF power spectrum with plasma electrons is strongly diminished, which causes absorption in the cold region of plasma periphery. This Thesis is focused on helping solution of an important conceptual problem, which is part of this challenge, by means of a noticeable application of strong radiofrequency power coupled to quasi- electrostatic plasma waves (LH waves). From the engineering point of view, results produced by an originally developed numerical code (LHPI) have backed solving the problem (existing for decades) of how to enable the antenna parameters determining the deposition of the coupled RF power (of several gigahertz) at a desired radial layer of the plasma column. This task would be ideally required indeed by an antenna. With respect to other current <b>drive</b> <b>tool,</b> based on electron cyclotron resonance (at about 150 GHz), this cannot guarantee the coverage of the outer half radius of plasma necessary for a reactor. Thanks to results reported here, new understanding is provided {{that for the first time}} enables a waveguide antenna for current drive in tokamaks to tailor the deposition in the plasma, in different operating conditions, by electronically acting on the launched spectrum (via feeding/phasing of waveguides). In particular, a) in case of too high plasma densities at the plasma edge, as occurs in running experiments, operation with higher temperature of plasma is recommended to avoid parasitic effects of spectral broadening. b) in case of too high plasma temperature at the plasma periphery, as envisaged in a future reactor, the assessment of a new antenna parameter, Δn//, allows however guaranteeing useful penetration of the coupled RF power into the plasma bulk. More specifically, the following issues have been considered in the Thesis. 1) Available data of RF power spectral broadening, kept during experiments carried out on the EAST tokamak (China), have been interpreted on the basis of the parametric instability modelling. This work has been performed thanks to a new version of a numerical code (developed on the basis of a previously version available since 1989 at ENEA-Frascati) having much improved qualities of velocity and precision. 2) The work has also focused on the key problem of how to enable the occurrence of the LHCD effect also in conditions of high electron temperature of reactor plasmas. Indeed, precisely the high temperature that in a reactor is expected to occur even at large radii of the plasma column which usefully prevents the occurrence of the parasitic effects observed in the experiments – would also produce an undesired RF power deposition too far out in the plasma, owing too strong electron Landau damping, as shown by numerical results. This circumstance is in contrast with the primary goal of a reactor of being equipped by current profile control, so that the too high plasma temperature of reactor represents the remaining major conceptual problem preventing the exploitation of the LHCD tool. This problem has been solved by the new outcome described in the Thesis. This result consists in having identified in a sufficiently narrow n// antenna power spectrum the way for reducing the wave-plasma interaction at high temperatures, thus enabling the penetration of the coupled RF power in the hot and dense regions of reactor plasmas. This diminished wave-plasma interaction is consequence of the content of standard quasi-linear theory of plasma waves: this aspect remained singularly undisclosed so far. 3) Finally, the thesis has analysed the problem of how to design an antenna capable of producing the required power spectra necessary for envisaging a current profile control system in a thermonuclear reactor. For carrying out this work, a numerical code has been utilised capable of treating waveguide antenna geometries however complex. Consequently, the desired sufficiently narrow n// power spectrum can be produced, indeed, by suitable array of active and passive phased array of rectangular waveguides. Moreover, the scan of the main antenna parameters (power reflection coefficient, directivity, etc,) performed assuming realistic conditions of plasma edge, has shown that all requirements should be satisfied for envisaging a current profile control system for a tokamak reactor based on the exploitation of the LHCD effect. The lower hybrid current <b>drive</b> <b>tool</b> in now fully supported by know how necessary for enabling the current profile control in the warm and dense plasma of thermonuclear reactor.

40|$|Knowing the {{performance}} of an application in a Grid environment {{is an important issue}} in application development and for scheduling decisions. In this paper we describe the analysis and optimisation of a computation- and communication-intensive application from the field of bioinformatics, which was demonstrated at the HPCChallenge of Supercomputing 2002 at Baltimore. This application has been adapted to be run on an heterogeneous computational Grid by means of PACX-MPI. The analysis and optimisation is based on trace <b>driven</b> <b>tools,</b> mainly Dimemas and Vampir. All these methodologies and tools are being extended in the frame of the DAMIEN IST project...|$|R
