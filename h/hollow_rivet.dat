50|$|Aluminum rims {{are often}} {{reinforced}} with either single eyelets or double eyelets {{to distribute the}} stress of the spoke. A single eyelet reinforces the spoke hole much like a <b>hollow</b> <b>rivet.</b> A double eyelet is a cup that is riveted into both walls of a double-walled rim.|$|E
50|$|A nocturnal {{will have}} an outer disc marked with the months of the year, and an inner disc marked with hours (and perhaps half hours, or quarter hours on the largest instruments) as well as {{locations}} for one or more reference stars. It will also have a pointer rotating on the same axis as the discs, sometimes extended beyond the rim. The axis, or pivot point, must be such that a star can be sighted through it; usually a <b>hollow</b> <b>rivet</b> is used. Since the instrument is used at night, markings may be exaggerated or raised. Often the inner disc has a diagram of the necessary constellations and stars, to aid in locating them.|$|E
5000|$|Blind rivets, {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "pop" [...] rivets (POP is the brand name of the original manufacturer, now owned by Stanley Engineered Fastening, a division of Stanley Black & Decker) are tubular and are supplied with a mandrel through the center. The rivet assembly is inserted into a hole drilled through the parts to be joined and a specially designed tool is used to draw the mandrel into the rivet. This expands the blind end of the rivet and then the mandrel snaps off. These types of blind rivets have non-locking mandrels and are sometimes avoided for critical structural joints because the mandrels may fall out, due to vibration or other reasons, leaving a <b>hollow</b> <b>rivet</b> that has a lower load-carrying capability than solid rivets. Furthermore, because of the mandrel they are more prone to failure from corrosion and vibration. Unlike solid rivets, blind rivets can be inserted and fully installed in a joint from only one side of a part or structure, [...] "blind" [...] to the opposite side.|$|E
50|$|The new helmet {{was pressed}} from sheets of {{molybdenum}} steel in several stages. The {{size of the}} flared visor and skirt was reduced, and the large projecting lugs for the obsolete armor shield were eliminated. The ventilator holes were retained, but were set in smaller <b>hollow</b> <b>rivets</b> mounted to the helmet's shell. The edges of the shell were rolled over, creating a smooth edge along the helmet. Finally, a completely new leather suspension, or liner, was incorporated that greatly improved the helmet's safety, adjustability, and comfort for each wearer. These improvements made the new M1935 helmet lighter, more compact, and more comfortable to wear than the previous designs.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel, strategy for fabricating the movable valve on paper-based microfluidic devices to manipulate capillary-driven fluids. The movable valve fabrication is first realized using <b>hollow</b> <b>rivets</b> as the-holding center it, control the paper channel in different layer movement that Jesuits in the :channel&# 39;s connection or disconnection. The relatively simple Valve fabrication procedure is robust, Versatile, and, compatible with microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mu PADs) with differing levels of complexity. It is remarkable that the movable valve can be convenient and free to control fluid without the timing setting; advantages {{that make it}} user-friendly for untrained users {{to carry out the}} complex multistep operations. For the, performance of the Movable valve to be-verified, several different designs of mu PADs were tested and obtained with satisfactory results. In addition; in the proof-of-concept enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments, we demonstrate the use of these valves in mu PADs for the successful analysis of samples of carcino-embryonic antigen, showing good sensitivity and reproducibility. We hope this technique will open new avenues for the fabrication of paper-based valves in an easily adoptable and widely available way on mu PADs and provide potential point-of-Care applications in the future...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{collections}} are important sources of material for {{many areas of}} ornithological research. Although firearms (particularly shotguns) have been the standard for avian scientific collecting for more than 100 years, their use is restricted {{in many areas of}} the world. We describe a cheap, relatively silent, and effective air shotgun for collecting birds weighing up to 50 g at distances up to 4 m. This air shotgun is capable of shooting birdshot, uses <b>hollow</b> metal <b>rivets</b> connected to plastic straws as shot shells, and represents a simple adaptation of any 0. 177 or 0. 22 cal single-shot, break-barrel air rifle with at least 25 joules of muzzle energy. This air shotgun will be especially useful for focused sampling of birds (and other small vertebrates) in situations where firearm use or transport is restricted.

5000|$|Rimless glasses lenses {{are held}} in place (or [...] "mounted") {{by way of a}} series of screws, or <b>hollow</b> plastic double <b>rivets</b> (called [...] "{{bushings}}" [...] or [...] "compression plugs") that fit into two holes in the lens. When bushings are used, the temples and bridge have barbed metal pins that lock into the bushings, creating a pressure seal that holds the lenses in place. Although they are more cosmetically appealing, the bushing method is more fragile than the screw and nut method, and more difficult for laypersons to repair themselves in the event of loosening or breakage. Bushing based rimless mounts are, however, designed so that the pins can pull out of the lenses without causing damage, which reduces repair cost and duration.|$|R
