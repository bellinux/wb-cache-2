25|$|The {{death of}} Alexander III of Scotland in 1286 threw {{the country into}} a {{succession}} crisis, and the English king, Edward <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> in to arbitrate. Edward claimed overlordship over Scotland, leading to the Wars of Scottish Independence. The English were eventually defeated, and the Scots were able to develop a stronger state under the Stuarts.|$|E
25|$|Although Alexander <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> to {{the throne}} in 1400 by the Hungarians (with {{assistance}} from Mircea I of Wallachia), he shifted his allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the Battle of Grunwald and the Siege of Marienburg), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia. His reign {{was one of the}} most successful in Moldavia's history, but also saw the very first confrontation with the Ottoman Turks at Cetatea Albă in 1420, and later even a conflict with the Poles. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandru's long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of Bogdan II and the ascension of Peter III Aaron in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as Matthias Corvinus deposed Aron and backed Alexăndrel {{to the throne}} in Suceava. Petru Aron's rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia's Ottoman Empire allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay tribute to Sultan Mehmed II.|$|E
25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E

25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
25|$|The ecclesial union {{engineered}} by Michael VIII was never popular in Byzantium, and, {{after his death}} (December 11, 1282), his son and successor, Andronicus II, repudiated it. On the day after Christmas, 1282, John Bekkos withdrew to a monastery; the former patriarch, Joseph <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> into the city on a stretcher, {{and a series of}} councils and public meetings ensued, led by a group of anti-unionist monks. Bekkos, in fear of violent death {{at the hands of a}} mob, was induced to sign a formal renunciation of his unionist opinions and of his priesthood (January, 1283), a renunciation which he afterwards disowned as extorted under duress, but which was used against him. After this, Bekkos spent some years under house arrest at a large monastery in Prusa in Asia Minor. From there, he began a literary campaign to exonerate himself, and succeeded in having a council called to reexamine his case; it took place at the imperial palace of Blachernae in Constantinople, meeting in several sessions from February to August in the year 1285. Although the Council of Blachernae reaffirmed Bekkos’s earlier condemnation, in the council’s aftermath Bekkos, by a series of writings, succeeded in bringing its dogmatic statement against him (the Tomus of 1285) into such disrepute that its principal author, the Patriarch Gregory II, resigned (1289). Bekkos saw this as vindicating his position. He spent the remaining years of his life in prison in the fortress of St. Gregory, revising his writings, maintaining friendly relations with the Emperor and prominent Byzantine churchmen, but unwilling to give up his unionist opinions; he died in 1297.|$|E

Dunstan later said of his involvement with the Liberals: [...] "I do not call it snobbery to deride the Establishment in South Australia, I admit that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> up into it, and I admit that it gave me a pain."

500|$|According to Lundberg, the 60 {{families}} slowly wrested {{control of}} the state during the 19th century and, beginning with the presidency of Grover Cleveland, essentially held total control over national institutions. He contends that U.S. entry into World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> about through pressures applied on the government by J.P. Morgan and John Francis Dodge, and that America's leading universities are {{at the behest of the}} 60 families due to influence applied through the endowment system. Lundberg also criticizes the New Deal, saying that it represents [...] "one faction of wealth – the light goods industrialists – pitted in bitter political struggle against another faction – the capital-goods industrialists" [...] and that it only appears to be a popular program to benefit the working class due to Franklin Roosevelt's insistence of such.|$|E

500|$|He {{was also}} the first Indian {{minister}} to visit Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. He reformed the arrangements relating to the conduct of the Haj pilgrimage. He initiated new policy-planning activities on the Indian Ocean and represented India at various global events during his 11-month tenure as minister. In April 2010, he resigned from the position, following allegations that he had misused his office to get shares in the IPL cricket franchise. Tharoor denied the charges and, during his resignation speech in Parliament, called for a full inquiry. In a 2014 rejoinder he defended his position: [...] "I was never involved in a scam of any sort in the IPL- <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> down because... antagonised some powerful political cricketing interests" [...] and added that he had [...] "cooperated extensively with the detailed investigation conducted by the Enforcement Directorate into the entire issue", and no wrongdoing had been found.|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Cyprus Avenue" [...] is a three chord blues {{composition}} and served {{for many years}} as the closing song for most of Morrison's live shows. [...] Along with [...] "Madame George", it {{is the centerpiece of}} the album and both songs are Belfast related and highly impressionistic. [...] The song is told {{from the point of view}} of an outsider watching from inside an automobile and getting tongue-tied as the refined school girl he fantasizes about appears and he imagines her a fine lady with [...] "rainbow ribbons in her hair" [...] in a carriage drawn by six white horses and [...] "returning from a fair". Van Morrison described Cyprus Avenue as [...] "a street in Belfast, [...] a place where there's a lot of wealth. [...] It wasn't far from where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> up and it was a very [...] different scene. [...] To me it was a very mystical place.
