50|$|The most {{commonly}} applied technique {{to provide a}} safe and shelf-stable milk is heat treatment. The first system involving <b>indirect</b> <b>heating</b> with continuous flow (125 °C for 6 min) was manufactured in 1893. In 1912, a continuous-flow, direct-heating method of mixing steam with milk at temperatures of 130 to 140 °C was patented. However, without commercially available aseptic packaging systems to pack and store the product, such technology was not very useful in itself, and further development was stalled until the 1950s. In 1953, APV pioneered a steam injection technology, involving direct injection of steam through a specially designed nozzle which raises the product temperature instantly, under brand name Uperiser; milk was packaged in sterile cans. In the 1960s APV launched the first commercial steam infusion system under the Palarisator brand name.|$|E
50|$|A {{single-ended}} recuperative (SER) burner {{is a type}} of {{gas burner}} used in high-temperature industrial kilns and furnaces. These burners are used where <b>indirect</b> <b>heating</b> is required, e.g. where the products of combustion are not allowed to combine with the atmosphere of the furnace. The typical design is a tubular (pipe) shape with convoluted pathways on the interior, closed on the end pointed into the furnace. A gas burner fires a flame down the center of these pathways, and the hot combustion gases are then forced to change direction and travel along the shell of the tube, heating it to incandescent temperatures and allowing efficient transfer of thermal energy to the furnace interior. Exhaust gas is collected back at the burner end where it is eventually discharged to the atmosphere. The hot exhaust can be used to pre-heat the incoming combustion air and fuel gas (recuperation) to boost efficiency.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwenty {{years ago}} a new {{technology}} {{was introduced to the}} fertilizer industry for cooling the final product before storage.

By eliminating large volumes of air, indirect plate exchangers offer the benefit of lower installed capital cost, much lower power consumption and reduced emissions. The result is significantly lower cost of ownership. Although the concept of the technology is simple, successful implementation requires a detailed knowledge of the science of <b>indirect</b> <b>heat</b> transfer, mass flow of bulk solids and the thermal characteristics of fertilizers.

50|$|The {{building}} {{was a combination}} of Greek revival and Traditional Federal styling. It was a brick structure with stepped gables, whereas most buildings of that time period were made of wood. The Bank building had a stone stoop with an ornamental wrought iron railing. The floor plan included a large central hall with one or two rooms on either side as well as a substantial staircase. The second floor was to be used as an apartment for the bank manager. The structure was built upon a stone basement, separate from the foundations of the vaults on the east and west sides. The west side vaults were used by the gas company offices {{on the west side of}} the building. In 1868 the bank was remodeled to include a third floor, to be used as rentable apartment space. In 1903 the {{building was}} renovated by the Pierce and Bickford architectural firm. The modifications included the addition of two more vaults to store books and currency, mahogany counters, terrazzo flooring, extra restrooms, coupon booths, and a ventilation system that included an <b>indirect</b> <b>heating</b> system and a fan for the summer months. In 1993 the Bank Building was renovated and restored by the Chemung County Historical Society, although many of the original features are still present.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process was}} {{developed}} to combine the shale oil production with production of sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, and aluminum from nahcolite and dawsonite, occurring in oil shales of the Piceance Basin. [...] In this process, the nahcolite is recovered from the raw oil shale by crushing it to lumps smaller than 8 in. As a result, most of the nahcolite in the oil shale becomes a fine powder what could screened out. Screened oil shale lumps are further crushed to particles smaller than 3 in. [...] Oil shale particles are further processed in a horizontal segmented doughnut-shaped traveling-grate retort in the direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>heating</b> mode. [...] The retort was originally designed by Davy McKee Corporation for iron ore pelletizing and it {{also known as the}} Dravo retort. In the direct retort, oil shale moves past ducts through which are provided hot inert gas for heating the raw oil shale, air for combustion of carbon residue (char or semi-coke) in the spent oil shale, and cold inert gas for cooling the spent oil shale. [...] The oil pyrolysis takes place in the heating section. To minimize solubility of aluminium compounds in the oil shale, the heat control is a crucial factor. Necessary heat for pyrolysis is generated in the carbon recovery section by combustion of carbon residue (char or semi-coke) remained in the spent oil shale. While blowing inert gases through the spent oil shale, the spent oil shale is cooled and gases are heated to cause pyrolysis. The indirect mode is similar; the difference is that combustion of carbonaceous residue takes place in separate vessel. The last section is for discharging of oil shale ash. Aluminium oxide and sodium carbonate are recovered from calcined dawsonite and calcined nahcolite in the oil shale ash.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. The concept of heat integration in batch chemical plants has been in literature {{for more than a}} decade. Heat integration in batch plants can be effceted in 2 ways, i. e. direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>heat</b> integration. Direct heat integration is encountered when both the source and the sink processes have to be active over a common time interval, assuming that the thermal driving forces allow. On the other hand, <b>indirect</b> <b>heat</b> integration allows heat integration of processes regardless of the time interval, as long as the source process takes place before the sink process so as to store energy or heat for later use. The thermal driving forces, nonetheless, must still be obeyed even in this type of heat integration. It is, therefore, evident from the foregoing statements that direct heat integration is more constrained than <b>indirect</b> <b>heat</b> integration. Presented in this paper is a mathematically rigorous technique for optimization of energy use through the exploitation of heat storage in heat integrated multipurpose batch plants. Storage of heat is effected {{through the use of a}} heat transfer fluid. The resultant mathematical formulation exhibits a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) stucture, which yields a globally optimal solution for a predefined storage size. vk 201...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the thermal drying of lignite has been carried out, by using an <b>indirect</b> <b>heat</b> pilot rotary drum. The process aims at the production of dry lignite and clean steam {{as part of a}} gasification procedure. Both flighted and bare drum modes have been employed. Temperature profiles along the dryer length, the amount of evaporation (moisture conversion) and the solids residence time distribution (RTD) were measured. A non-isothermal model was tested under three different regimes of solids flow. Model integration, by taking account of experimental amount of evaporation at dryer exit and temperature profiles along the dryer length, has been utilized in the validation of drying kinetics and heat transfer correlations. Model predictions compare satisfactorily with the operating data of an <b>indirect</b> <b>heat</b> industrial lignite dryer. Overall heat transfer coefficients of the pilot rotary dryer were found to agree well with those reported for direct heat dryers...|$|R
