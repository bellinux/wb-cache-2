5000|$|Kokko and Ots [...] {{suggests}} that, despite inbreeding depression, {{there exists}} a significant advantage to incestuous mating choices. Their paper states that there are indirect and direct fitness benefits that outweigh the cost of inbreeding. In species where there is low parental investment and sexual encounters are rare and sequential, <b>incestuous</b> <b>breeding</b> is indirectly beneficial. If the prospective mates are related there is an increase mutual interest in finding a resolution with respect to playing the unpreferred sexual role. With less time allotted to conflicting over sexual roles and dominating one another, procreation is more cost-effective. Under these conditions, the greater effectiveness of inbreeding prevails over the detriment of incestuous mating and evolutionarily select for a preference for related mates.|$|E
40|$|Between 1959 and 1968 {{the entire}} world {{population}} of Seychelles warblers (Acrocephalus sechellensis) comprised only 26 – 29 individuals entirely confined to Cousin Island (26 ha). Through conservation actions the island population has reached a carrying capacity of ca 320 birds since 1982. The warbler population has significantly lower levels of genetic variation, as determined by multilocus DNA fingerprinting, compared with its mainland relative, the Australian warbler (Acrocephalus australis) and other outbred natural bird populations (mean band sharing coefficients are 0. 50, 0. 22 and 0. 21, respectively), and has a very low annual reproductive rate of 0. 28 yearlings per breeding pair. Therefore some degree of inbreeding may have occurred in this population. The relatively low level of genetic variation is not directly responsible for this low reproductive output since breeding pairs that were transferred to the islands of Aride (68 ha) and Cousine (29 ha) with similar vegetation and climate, but with higher year-round insect food abundance, had significantly higher fecundity and survival. In contrast, no difference in reproductive success was observed between <b>incestuous</b> <b>breeding</b> pairs and non-incestuous breeding pairs. In addition, annual production of yearlings by pairs on Aride was on average 44 times higher than that by the same pairs on Cousin before the transfer. Annual production of yearlings by pairs on Cousine, that were as inbred as those on Aride, was on average five times higher than that by the same pairs on Cousin before the transfer. Eight years after translocation, the Aride population had grown to over 1000 birds, and six years after translocation, the Cousine population had grown to 186 birds. The experiments, controlled for group size, breeding partner, breeder age and experience, showed that the differences in reproductive success by warblers on the three islands cannot be due to genetic differences because of similar band-sharing similarities, but seem entirely accounted for by differences in food supply. Although the amount of genetic variation in the Seychelles warblers is relatively low, the demographic parameters do not indicate apparent signs of inbreeding depression in these populations. ...|$|E
40|$|Encephalopathy in sheep was {{at first}} {{described}} in Ireland in 1732 and was called “scrapie“ because the animals tend to tear their hair. Historically {{it seems to be}} the result of an <b>incestuous</b> union as <b>breeding</b> practice in old farms. In Sicily the animal bones found in association with the human skeletal remains from the tombs or city-sites, comprised a broad range of domestic. Usually, species included in the collected bones are domestic animals commonly eaten as sheep or goats, cattle, pigs, chickens and a small partridge. In this contest, the assemblage and the species identification is often difficult. Based on DNA barcoding, all the investigated bones were confirmed as belonging to the Ovine specie. Most of the elements were not whitened or brittle, suggesting none exposure period to weathering and the soft tissues were decomposed slowly. The aim of this study was to investigate the SNP variants of the ovine PrP gene (PrnP) that is associated with the risk of scrapie disease. Sheep susceptibility to classic scrapie is associated with mutational points that leads to the recognized variants: codon 136 (Alanine/Valine), codon 141 (Leucine/Phenylalanine), codon 154 (Arginine/Histidine) and codon 171 (Arginine/Glutamine/Histidine). Ancient DNA was isolated directly from 200 animal skeletal remains and collected on four Sicilian medieval archaeological sites (10 th – 12 th century). aDNA extraction was performed from the epiphysis of the skeletal remains containing dry bone marrow cells and used as template to perform real time PCR and sequencing. The obtained data were analyzed for the assignment of the PrnP genotype at the 136, 141, 154 and 171 codons. Results showed that the 90...|$|R
