25|$|Identification of Japanese {{knotweed}} is {{not always}} easy. Many other plants are suspected of being knotweed, due often to the similar appearance of leaves and stems. Dogwood, lilac, Houttuynia (Houttuynia cordata), ornamental Bistorts such as Red Bistort (Persicaria amplexicaulis), lesser knotweed (Persicaria campanulata), Himalayan Balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), Broadleaved Dock (Rumex obtusifolius), Bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), bamboo, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>Honeysuckle</b> (Leycesteria formosa), and Russian Vine (Fallopia baldschuanica) have been suspected of being Fallopia japonica.|$|E
50|$|Grazing was {{excluded}} from the park in 1957, {{one of the earliest}} exclusions of this activity in any alpine park. Weed species, particularly <b>Himalayan</b> <b>honeysuckle,</b> yarrow and blackberries, pose a continuing management challenge.|$|E
50|$|It {{contains}} six {{or seven}} species of shrubs with short-lived stems with soft wood, growing to 1-2.5 m tall. One species, Leycesteria formosa (<b>Himalayan</b> <b>honeysuckle</b> or flowering nutmeg), is a popular garden shrub in Britain.|$|E
5000|$|Leycesteria formosa (<b>Himalayan</b> <b>honeysuckle,</b> {{flowering}} nutmeg, Himalaya nutmeg or pheasant berry) is a deciduous shrub in {{the family}} Caprifoliaceae, native to the Himalaya and southwestern China. It is considered a noxious invasive species in Australia, New Zealand, the neighboring islands of Micronesia, and some other places.|$|E

30|$|Measurements {{of weeds}} were taken within {{a circle of}} 1 -m radius around each tree. The 1 -m circle was {{subdivided}} into four quadrants centred around the tree and {{the height of the}} tallest weed in each quadrant was recorded. These four values were averaged to determine the mean maximum weed height (Av_ht). The percentage weed cover within each quadrant was estimated (Av_cov) and the proportion of cover in broadly described functional weed types identified: (1) grasses, (2) herbaceous annuals (HBL) and (3) scrub weeds (C. scoparius, U. europaeus, R. fruticosus, Leycesteria formosa Wall. (<b>Himalayan</b> <b>honeysuckle)</b> and native woody plants).|$|E
40|$|The current {{silvicultural}} {{regimes of}} Pinus radiata plantations in New Zealand with wider initial tree spacings {{have created the}} potential for increased growth of understorey vegetation. A consequence {{of this is that}} the response of P. radiata to P fertiliser is expected to be more influenced by the interaction between the P fertiliser, the tree and the understorey vegetation than {{was the case in the}} past. The objectives of this study were to investigate the influence of different rates of a soluble and a sparingly-soluble P fertiliser (Triple superphosphate and Ben-Geurier phosphate rock) and weed control, and their interactions, on soil P chemistry and the growth and P uptake of 4 - 5 -year-old second-rotation P. radiata on an Allophanic Soil (Kaweka forest) and a Pumice Soil (Kinleith forest). The results showed that the application of P fertilisers had no effect on P. radiata growth at both field trial sites two years after this treatment, although it increased radiata needle P concentration. However, at both sites, the understorey vegetation removal treatment increased tree diameter at breast height and basal area. At the highly P-deficient (Bray- 2 P 4 µg g- 1) Kaweka forest, the presence of understorey (bracken fern and some manuka) reduced resin-Pi and Olsen P concentrations, but at the moderate P fertility (Bray- 2 P 13 µg g- 1) Kinleith forest, the understorey (<b>Himalayan</b> <b>honeysuckle,</b> buddleia and some toetoe) increased Bray- 2 P, resin-Pi, and Olsen P concentrations. A glasshouse study on P. radiata seedlings was conducted to test the hypothesis that when ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) is grown with P. radiata, it increases radiata needle P concentration, while when broom (Cytisus scoparius L.) is grown with P. radiata, it has no effect. The acid phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of P. radiata was higher when radiata was grown with broom than that when it was grown with ryegrass. This is consistent with the higher P concentration in needles of radiata grown with broom than that of radiata grown with ryegrass, in the absence of P fertiliser addition. However, when P fertiliser was added (50 and 100 µg P g- 1 soil) the needle P concentration of radiata grown with broom was lower than that when radiata was grown with ryegrass...|$|E
