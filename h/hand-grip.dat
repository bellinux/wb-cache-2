25|$|From {{pictorial}} sources, it {{is probable}} that the Hypaspists, elite members of the infantry, including the Agema of the King's personal foot guard, employed a shield of larger dimensions, the traditional Greek hoplite shield called the hoplon or aspis (ἀσπίς), it is also referred to as the 'Argive shield'. This shield, also circular, was larger than the phalangite shield, it had sheet-bronze facing over a wooden base; it was held with the left forearm passing through a central armband with a <b>hand-grip</b> set just inside the rim. This shield was more much convex than the phalangite shield and had a projecting rim, both features precluding its use with a double handed pike. The style of shield used by cavalry, if any, is less clear; the heavy cavalry of Alexander's time did not employ shields.|$|E

The Welrod pistol was a simple, bolt-action pistol developed by the SOE for use in World War II. It was designed [...] for supplying to foreign British-aligned insurgents and for use by covert British forces. The pistol was designed with an integral sound suppressor, and was ideal for killing sentries and other covert work; the bolt-operated action meant that cocking the gun produced almost no noise, and the bulky but efficient suppressor eliminated {{nearly all of the}} muzzle blast. Welrod pistols included a magazine that doubled as a <b>hand-grip,</b> and were originally produced with no markings save a serial number.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{training}} has started adopting innovative experimental techniques to assess athletes' behaviour to define dedicated and focalized training strategies to further increase their performances.

Thus, special and costly training tools have been designed and tested. The drawback of these tools is that they typically cannot be used in real competitions. The present paper deals with the design and testing of a dynamometric <b>hand-grips</b> for climbing. The design was carried out to allow using the <b>hand-grips</b> not only during training but also during competitions.

Where the earth sloped so steeply that it was impossible to stand for a second upright, the man did not hesitate. His foot pressed the impossible surface for but a fraction of the fatal second and gave him the bound that carried him onward.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{reproducibility}} of arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) provided by the spontaneous baroreflex method at rest and during laboratory tests. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were studied 24 h apart, in the same laboratory and under the same environmental conditions, at rest, during active standing, while performing mental arithmetics and during static <b>hand-gripping.</b> Systolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and pulse interval were continuously and non-invasively measured by using a Finapres device. BRS was evaluated by analysing the slopes of spontaneously occurring sequences of three or more consecutive beats in which systolic blood pressure and pulse interval of the following beat both increased or decreased, in the same direction, in a linear fashion. Individual BRS were obtained by averaging all slopes computed within a given test. RESULTS: Under each test condition BRS did not differ significantly between the two consecutive days, showing strikingly similar values. The mean group coefficients of variation (CVAR), obtained by averaging individual CVAR, between the two experimental days were 15. 0, 13. 9 and 19. 7 % for resting, standing, static <b>hand-gripping</b> and mental arithmetic, respectively. No relationships were found between individual CVAR and individual mean arterial pressure, pulse interval and number of baroreflex sequences under any tested condition, on both experimental days. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the spontaneous baroreflex method provides good BRS reproducibility under various stimuli that affect the neural control of circulation differently. They also suggest that BRS variability is dependent neither on haemodynamic modifications nor on the degree of baroreflex engagement, but it seems to reflect an inherent feature of the way in which arterial baroreflex modulate the heart period...|$|R
60|$|Two nights {{had passed}} since the {{foregoing}} occurrences, when, in a breezy September forenoon, I set forth from town, on foot, towards Blithedale. It was the most delightful of all days for a walk, {{with a dash of}} invigorating ice-temper in the air, but a coolness that soon gave place to the brisk glow of exercise, while the vigor remained as elastic as before. The atmosphere had a spirit and sparkle in it. Each breath was like a sip of ethereal wine, tempered, as I said, with a crystal lump of ice. I had started on this expedition in an exceedingly sombre mood, as well befitted one who found himself tending towards home, but was conscious that nobody would be quite overjoyed to greet him there. My feet were hardly off the pavement, however, when this morbid sensation began to yield to the lively influences of air and motion.

60|$|They {{inhabited}} the same room, Flotsam and Jetsam, but {{never spoke to}} one another. And yet in all that hospital of French soldiers {{they were the only}} two who, in a manner of speaking, had come from England. Fourteen hundred years have passed since the Briton ancestors of Roche crossed in their shallow boats. Yet he was as hopelessly un-French as a Welshman of the hills is to this day un-English. His dark face, shy as a wild animal's, his peat-brown eyes, and the rare, strangely-sweet smile which once in a way strayed up into them; his creased brown hands always trying to tie an imaginary cord; the tobacco pouched in his brown cheek; his improperly-buttoned blue trousers; his silence eternal as the stars themselves; his habit of climbing trees--all marked him out as no true Frenchman. Indeed, that habit of climbing trees caused every soul who saw him to wonder if he ought to be at large: monkeys alone pursue this pastime. And yet,--surely one might understand that trees were for Roche the masts of his far-off fishing barque, each <b>hand-grip</b> on the branch of plane or pine-tree solace to his overmastering hunger for the sea. Up there he would cling, or stand with hands in pockets, and look out, far over the valley and the yellowish-grey-pink of the pan-tiled town-roofs, a mile away, far into the mountains where snow melted not, far over this foreign land of 'midi trois quarts,' to an imagined Breton coast and the seas that roll from there to Cape Breton where the cod are. Since he never spoke unless spoken to--no, not once--it was impossible for his landsmen comrades to realise why he got up those trees, and they would summon each other to observe this 'phénomène,' this human ourang-outang, who had not their habit of keeping firm earth beneath their feet. They understood his other eccentricities better. For instance, he could not stay still even at his meals, but must get up and slip out, because he chewed tobacco, and, since the hospital regulations forbade his spitting on the floor, he must naturally go and spit outside. For 'ces types-la' to chew and drink was--life! To the presence of tobacco in the cheek and the absence of drink from the stomach they attributed all his un-French ways, save just that one mysterious one of climbing trees.|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Experimental Mechanics [Springer Verlag © Society for Experimental Mechanics] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] 'feel' of tennis rackets is of increasing importance to manufacturers seeking product differentiation in a context where further performance enhancements are prevented by a combination of mechanical limits and regulations imposed to protect the integrity of the sport. Vibrations excited during a shot contribute greatly to the perception of 'feel'. Previous studies have been reported but none has covered the full set of mode families or the frequency range in this study. In-plane vibrations associated with the routine use of topspin shots in modern tennis have not been documented so far in the literature. To consider modal behaviour, multiple measurements during play conditions are required but this is practically impossible. This paper proposes an alternative approach and successfully relates a comprehensive modal analysis on a freely suspended racket to vibration measurements under play conditions. This is achieved through an intermediate stage comprising a necessarily more limited modal analysis on a <b>hand-gripped</b> racket and use of the mass modification modal analysis tool. This stage confirmed the prevailing view that <b>hand-gripping</b> can be considered as a mass modification distributed along the handle of the freely suspended racket but the associated mass was much lower than that of an actual hand and the hand also increased the damping ratio of frame modes significantly. Furthermore, in frame vibration measurements during forehand groundstrokes, a greater reduction in bending mode frequencies was observed, consistent with a mass-loading of around 25  % of the actual hand {{as a consequence of the}} tighter grip. In these play tests, the first two bending modes, the first torsional mode, the first eight stringbed modes, the first three hoop modes and the third in-plane bending mode were identified, with the stringbed modes being particularly prominent. © 2013 Society for Experimental Mechanics...|$|R

The proposed method can simultaneously detect activation areas and estimate the HR latency. We also studied variability of the HR latency across subjects within the same activation sites, across acquisition days within a subject, and among activation sites within a subject. The experiments were done on 10 healthy subjects with <b>hand-gripping</b> tasks. We found no significant difference of HR latencies at a given activation site within a subject across acquisition days.
