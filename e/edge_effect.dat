25|$|Modern {{sequencing}} methods usually sequence {{both ends}} of a larger fragment, which provides linking information for de novo assembly and improved probabilities for alignment to reference sequence. Researchers generally believe that longer lengths of data (read lengths) enhance performance for very large DNA targets, an idea consistent with predictions from distribution models. However, Wendl showed that smaller fragments provide better coverage on small, linear targets because they reduce the <b>edge</b> <b>effect</b> in linear molecules. These findings have implications for sequencing the products of DNA filtering procedures. Read-pairing and fragment size evidently have negligible influence for large, whole-genome class targets.|$|E
25|$|In {{conventional}} cell culture, {{growth is}} restricted to one plane, causing monolayer formation with most cells contacting the surface; however, the 3D curvature of the aragonite surface allows multiple layers to develop and for astrocytes far apart to contact each other. It is important to promote process formation similar to 3D in vivo conditions, because astrocytic process morphology is essential in guiding directionality of regenerating axons. The aragonite topography provides a high surface {{area to volume ratio}} and lacks edges, which leads to a reduction of the culture <b>edge</b> <b>effect.</b> Crystalline matrices such as the aragonite mentioned here are allowed for the promotion of a complex 3D tissue formation that approaches in vivo conditions.|$|E
25|$|Landscape patches have a {{boundary}} between them {{which can be}} defined or fuzzy. The zone composed of the edges of adjacent ecosystems is the boundary. Edge means the portion of an ecosystem near its perimeter, where influences of the adjacent patches can cause an environmental difference between {{the interior of the}} patch and its edge. This <b>edge</b> <b>effect</b> includes a distinctive species composition or abundance. For example, when a landscape is a mosaic of perceptibly different types, such as a forest adjacent to a grassland, the edge is the location where the two types adjoin. In a continuous landscape, such as a forest giving way to open woodland, the exact edge location is fuzzy and is sometimes determined by a local gradient exceeding a threshold, such as the point where the tree cover falls below thirty-five percent.|$|E

Unless additional data are collected to create a buffer of data outside the study area, <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> occur. A few methods (k-function) have sophisticated edge corrections, but many do not. <b>Edge</b> <b>effects</b> are {{beyond the scope of this}} paper. However, it is important to point out that creating internal boundaries, as we do with topographic constraints, creates internal <b>edge</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Buffer strips {{are very}} {{important}} in helping to provide habitat for many species of wildlife [...] in the open farm lands by causing an <b>edge</b> <b>effect.</b> [...] With much of the land open on farms having an edge allows a safe-haven for animals to move between different ecosystems. Buffers are also helpful in conserving biodiversity especially to that of rare or endangered species through the incorporation of native grasses into their seeding by the landowner. [...] are especially important to pheasants, quail, chukar and songbirds because they provide the foods they need {{as well as the}} shelter from predators. Since most buffer strip areas have limited disturbance from farming it allows for a shelter to hide year round for many of the species including insects, birds, and mammals. When buffers run into and follow riparian areas along stream beds {{it is important to have}} larger vegetation like trees and shrubs that shade the water from the open sun. The water is then able to be cooler allowing for greater fish production and other aquatic plants and other biota to thrive in a less disturbed environment.|$|E

Depending on {{the width of}} streamside reserves, <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> {{have the potential to}} compromise their effectiveness for terrestrial conservation, yet <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> into riparian environments have rarely been assessed. It would be unwise to assume that <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> act in the same way at streamside reserves as at the non-riparian edges of logging coupes, as interactions with riparian influences on beetles along the stream-upslope gradient might create unique edge conditions. In this study, we assess <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> on ground dwelling beetles at four sites, using transects of pitfall traps across logging coupe edges into streamside reserves that have only been affected by logging {{on one side of the}} stream. <b>Edge</b> <b>effects</b> were found to extend further into streamside reserves in this study than into upslope habitat at the same sites from a concurrent study. <b>Edge</b> <b>effects</b> were site specific and appeared to extend as far as the stream in most cases (23 – 65 m). Comparison of beetle assemblage composition with adjacent unlogged streams supported the conclusion that beetles within 10 m of streams in streamside reserves were still responding to <b>edge</b> <b>effects.</b> These results suggest that streamside reserves might not contain habitat comparable with riparian areas away from the influences of nearby clearfelling, and wider reserves are recommended to maintain core habitat not compromised by <b>edge</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>effects</b> are {{increasingly}} important in British Columbia forests, as cutblocks become smaller and harvesting options with retention patches are more commonly used. This note summarizes <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> for 21 ecosystem variables, including microclimate, soil chemistry, snow depth, windthrow, regeneration, vegetation, and animals, at the Sicamous Creek Silvicultural Systems project in a high-elevation ESSF forest. Physical {{variables such as}} soil temperatures and snowmelt showed small <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> up to 30 – 50 m from forest–cutblock <b>edges.</b> <b>Effects</b> on plants and animals typically extended at most 10 – 20 m from the edge, except for windthrow, with effects more than 25 m into the forest along some edges. Substantial windthrow adjacent to large openings may also lead to “edge creep, ” where <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> extend into the forest over time, affecting many ecological values. Bryophytes and spruce grouse showed increasing <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> in the initial post-harvest years. Because <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> from uncut forest did not extend far into cut areas, small openings (< 1 ha) interspersed with narrow leave strips or numerous small retention patches are likely most effective for retaining “forest influence ” throughout a cutblock. Large retained patches and wide corridors will still be important at the landscape scale, but small patches also have considerable conservation value, provided that windthrow is managed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a contribution to}} the influence of <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> on the load transmitted by adhesively-bonded assemblies. Bonded assemblies are mostly characterized by the presence of stress concentrations {{at the bottom of the}} adhesive and in its thickness near the interface. This phenomenon, called <b>edge</b> <b>effects,</b> plays a very important role in the macroscopic observed behaviour of an adhesive in an assembly. Thus, to describe its behaviour it is necessary to propose solutions to reduce the <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> for the bonded test specimens used to characterize the adhesive and for industrial applications. Mastering <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> improves the efficiency of bonded parts and reduces the dispersions of the loads at failure. In the first part a modified Arcan test fixture is described to analyze the behaviour of an adhesive in an assembly under traction-shear loadings. The test specimens use a specific geometry to reduce the <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> (beaks). In the second part, <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> are analyzed by the finite element method under elastic hypothesis. In the third part, experimental results for traction-shear Arcan tests are presented. And finally, this method to reduce <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> is applied to the bonding of a rail on a composite mast for high competitive sailing boats...|$|R

Griffith (1980; 1983) and Griffith and Amrhein (1983) highlighted problems according to the <b>edge</b> <b>effect.</b> A typical example is a cross-boundary influence such as cross-border jobs, services and other resources located in a neighboring municipality (Macquire 1995).|$|E

40|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>effects</b> and linear canopy {{openings}} {{may change}} ecological patterns and processes on forests. Here we investigate if these openings in a lowland Brazilian Atlantic forest cause <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> on seedlings. We sampled seedling communities at forest edges near to two linear canopy openings (gas pipeline and power line) and in interiors far from edges.

The results showed that <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> of linear canopy openings affect seedling communities leading to low densities on edges that showed less favorable conditions for arrival, establishment and initial survival. The basal area patterns were not affected by <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> apparently by the resistance of the seedlings that have more than 4 mm diameter. Therefore, linear canopy openings caused <b>edge</b> <b>effects,</b> which determine low seedling densities on edges. However this pattern is not due to increase mortality on these edges...|$|R

Our model provided {{a more realistic}} assessment of <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> than those based on traditional methods. Unique characteristics of the D-AEI model included: (1) preservation of the spatial characteristics of the landscape structure; (2) incorporation {{of the most critical}} parameters controlling <b>edge</b> <b>effects,</b> such as <b>edge</b> orientation, edge contrast, prevailing direction of <b>edge</b> <b>effects,</b> decay value, and interior approximation; and (3) ability to quantify <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> for various variables at multiple scales. The model is flexible so that the users can define key parameters and generate ecologically relevant output based on environmental and spatial characteris-tics of the study area and the study purpose. Our results demonstrated that: (a) <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> were not symmetrically distributed in all directions around clearcuts; (b) AEI was not necessarily continuous around patches; and (c) boundary dynamics and multiple <b>edge</b> <b>effects</b> were clearly reflected across the landscape. Results from this research are important for current and future resource assessments, biological conservation and wildlife habitat management, biodiversity studies of flora and fauna, microclimatic research, future studies on edges and their importance in landscape design and analysis.
