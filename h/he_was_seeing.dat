5|$|Rainie was reintroduced {{as part of}} the 'Who Killed Lucy Beale?' storyline, a {{story that}} began in April 2014 when Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) was murdered, and climaxed {{as part of the}} 30th anniversary {{celebrations}} of EastEnders in February 2015. Lucy's father Ian Beale's (Adam Woodyatt) alibi was revealed as fake soon after Lucy's death, and on 16 June 2014 it was revealed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> Rainie, who had become a prostitute to fund her drug addiction, on the night Lucy died. Rainie then began blackmailing Ian for more money in return for keeping his actions secret from the police and his fiance Denise Fox (Diane Parish).|$|E
5|$|The King of Sparta– Featured in God of War comic #6. The King's Guard was {{convinced}} by Kratos' wife Lysandra to allow Kratos {{to embark on}} a quest for the Ambrosia that would restore their plague-stricken daughter, Calliope. Kratos and his men were given until the next full moon to return before the King executed his daughter. Ultimately successful, Kratos returned, saved Calliope, and gave the rest of the elixir to the King. The King then officially awarded Kratos with the rank of Captain. The King of Sparta also appears as an illusion created by Tisiphone in Ascension where he honors Kratos for his service as his best general. Kratos believed what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> at first until he saw Tisiphone's ring on the king's finger. He kicked Tisiphone off the balcony, dispelling her illusion. When Kratos {{was on the verge of}} victory over the Furies, Tisiphone changed into the form of the King once again, telling him that he was unworthy of being called a Spartan. The character was voiced by Crispin Freeman in Ascension.|$|E

He called this phenomenon equipotentiality. We know now that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> evidence of plasticity in the brain. The brain has the spectacular ability for certain areas to take over the functions of other areas if those areas should fail or be removed.|$|E

25|$|When {{day three}} began, England may have harboured hopes {{of picking up}} the last four Australian wickets quickly, and setting about {{building}} a solid lead, however Steve Waugh wanted to press on. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> the ball well, and moving {{into some of the}} best form of his career so far, and made the most of it. Well supported by Hughes, who made a solid 30, Waugh began to free his arms, and lifted the Australian's run-rate.|$|E
25|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle {{had served}} as a {{volunteer}} doctor in the Langman Field Hospital at Bloemfontein between March and June 1900. In his widely distributed and translated pamphlet 'The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct' he justified both the reasonings behind the war and handling of the conflict itself. He also pointed out that over 14,000 British soldiers had died of disease during the conflict (as opposed to 8000 killed in combat) and at the height of epidemics <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> 50–60 British soldiers dying each day in a single ill-equipped and overwhelmed military hospital.|$|E
25|$|When the King {{toured the}} front (24 October) Haig {{told him that}} Robertson should go home and become CIGS, whilst Robertson told the King (27 October 1915) that Haig should replace French. He was {{promoted}} to permanent lieutenant general on 28 October 1915. Robertson clinched his claim as the future CIGS with a lengthy paper (actually written by Maurice, dated 8 November) “The Conduct of the War”, arguing that all British efforts must be directed at the defeat of Germany. Robertson told Haig from London (15 November 1915), where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> the King and Kitchener, “the first thing is to get you in command”.|$|E

25|$|According {{to local}} tradition, John Hendrix (1865–1915), an {{eccentric}} local resident {{regarded as a}} mystic, prophesied the establishment of Oak Ridge some 40 years before construction began. Upset {{by the death of}} his young daughter and the subsequent departure of his wife and remaining family, he became religious and told his neighbors <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> visions. When he described his visions, people thought he was insane; for this reason, he was institutionalized for a time. According to several published accounts, one vision that he described repeatedly was considered to be a description of the city and production facilities built 28 years after his death, to be used in World War II.|$|E
25|$|Hutton's {{main line}} of {{argument}} was that the tremendous displacements and changes <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> did not happen {{in a short period}} of time by means of catastrophe, but that the incremental processes of uplift and erosion happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, in order to allow time for the changes to occur. While his ideas of Plutonism were hotly contested, scientific inquiries on competing ideas of catastrophism pushed back the age of the Earth into the millions of years – still much younger than commonly accepted by modern scientists, but a great change from the literalist view of an Earth that was only a few thousand years old.|$|E
25|$|As the {{takeoff roll}} began, {{the first officer}} noted several times to the captain that the {{instrument}} panel readings <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> {{did not seem to}} reflect reality (he was referring {{to the fact that the}} plane did not appear to have developed as much power as it needed for takeoff, despite the instruments indicating otherwise). The captain dismissed these concerns and let the takeoff proceed. Investigators later determined that there was plenty of time and space on the runway for the captain to have aborted the takeoff, and criticized his refusal to listen to his first officer, who was correct that the instrument panel readings were wrong. The pilot was told not to delay because another aircraft was 2.5 miles out (4km) on final approach to the same runway. The following is a transcript of Flight 90's cockpit voice recorder during the plane's acceleration down the runway.|$|E

25|$|As well as combating the Neptunists, he also {{opened up}} the concept of deep time for {{scientific}} purposes, in opposition to Catastrophism. Rather than accepting that the earth {{was no more than}} a few thousand years old, he maintained that the Earth must be much older, with a history extending indefinitely into the distant past. His main line of argument was that the tremendous displacements and changes <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> did not happen in a short period of time by means of catastrophe, but that processes still happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, to allow time for the changes. Before long, scientific inquiries provoked by his claims had pushed back the age of the earth into the millions of yearsstill too short when compared with the accepted 4.6 billion year age in the 21st century, but a distinct improvement.|$|E

[...] Nelson's impressions were similar: [...] "It was the absolute misogyny of his crimes that stunned me," [...] she wrote, [...] "his manifest rage against women. He had no compassion at all ... he was totally engrossed in the details. His murders were his life's accomplishments." ...|$|E

Several of his poems were published in a 1925 collection edited by Perpessicius and Ion Pillat (Antologia poeților de azi), and were accompanied by an ink portrait signed Marcel Janco; at the time, Caragiale announced {{that he was going to}} publish a series of poems under the title Pajere (it was to be printed only after his death).

500|$|Many reviewers criticised the {{repetition}} of the game's levels. Francesco Serino (Eurogamer) criticised the variation between levels and said it wasn't too long before <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> similar levels because of the game's simplicity. He said that the levels are usually well made but are too often made for certain characters, which adds more gameplay {{because of the time}} it takes to discover the best strategies to complete a level. Alex Navarro (Giant Bomb) liked the overall gameplay of Monaco but disliked some of the later levels as they turned into [...] "tedious exercises in trial-and-error". Ben Allan (Gameplanet) said the single-player mode was less fun due to there being fewer variations and less chaos. Anton Bjurvald said that he fell in love with the simplicity of the graphics and liked the majority of the gameplay but said that it seemed like the game's artificial intelligence was made too easy to be fooled.|$|E

He did not at the time consider {{that he had made}} a new discovery; he seems to have assumed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, the western coast of which had been explored and given the name [...] "New South Greenland" [...] in 1821, by Robert Johnson, a former captain of the Wasp. [...] Johnson's name for this land was never adopted; in 1831 it was named Graham Land. At the time of Morrell's voyage the geographical character and dimensions of the peninsula were [...] unknown; Morrell's recorded position was in fact far to the east of the peninsula. Morrell's account reads: [...] "At half past [...] we were close on with the body of land to which Captain Johnson had given the name of New South Greenland". [...] The next few days were spent exploring this supposed coast, which was apparently rich in seal. Some [...] further south, Morrell thought he could see snow-covered mountains.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{stories that}} were {{centered}} on scientific inventions and set in the future, in the tradition of Jules Verne, were appearing regularly in popular fiction magazines. [...] The first science fiction (sf) magazine, Amazing Stories, was launched in 1926 by Hugo Gernsback {{at the height of the}} pulp magazine era. [...] It was successful, and helped to form science fiction as a separately marketed genre, but in February 1929 Gernsback lost control of the publisher when it went bankrupt. [...] By April he had formed a new company, Gernsback Publications Incorporated, and created two subsidiaries: Techni-Craft Publishing Corporation and Stellar Publishing Corporation. In the middle of the year he launched three new magazines: a non-sf magazine titled Radio Craft, and two sf pulps titled Science Wonder Stories and Air Wonder Stories. [...] These were followed in September 1929 by the first issue of Science Wonder Quarterly, and in October Gernsback sent a letter to some of the writers he had already bought material from, letting them know that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> more demand for [...] "detective or criminal mystery stories with a good scientific background". [...] He named Arthur B. Reeve's [...] "Craig Kennedy" [...] stories as an example, and also mentioned S.S. Van Dine's [...] "Philo Vance" [...] stories, which were very popular at the time. [...] In the January 1930 issue of both the sf magazines, Gernsback advertised the new magazine that he hoped to populate with these stories: Scientific Detective Monthly.|$|E
500|$|For {{several weeks}} {{following}} the death of his daughter Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) receives texts and calls from [...] "R", all of which he ignores. After texting her to leave him alone, [...] "R" [...] comes to Walford and is revealed to be Rainie. She blackmails Ian, threatening to tell his fiancée Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and son Peter Beale (Ben Hardy) that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> her as a prostitute on Good Friday, the night of Lucy's death. When Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) sees Rainie, she reveals what Ian has done, but he is unable to tell Denise when he suffers a stroke. Ian meets Rainie to tell her that he will not pay her anymore, but Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) catches Ian and pulls up behind him. Ian drives away so Rainie approaches Mick, thinking he is a customer. He rejects her but the police arrest him for soliciting a prostitute. To protect Ian, Mick pleads guilty. Rainie and Cora meet at the court, as Cora has come to support Linda Carter (Kellie Bright). Cora confronts Rainie, and realises that she is the prostitute involved, and sees how low she has fallen and gives her money to fund her addiction so she can stop her prostitution. Ian tells Phil what has happened, so Phil pays Rainie, telling her to stop blackmailing Ian. Phil finds a flat for Rainie in Walford but she is thrown out by her landlord because of her prostitution. Phil takes Rainie to Cora to deal with her, so Cora lets Rainie live with her. Rainie tries to blackmail Mick into giving her more money but he insults and humiliates her. She then tells Denise about her night with Ian. Cora promises to help her get clean, but when she goes out, she returns to find Rainie gone and that she has stolen all her money. A flashback later reveals what happened between Rainie and Ian on the day Lucy died.|$|E
