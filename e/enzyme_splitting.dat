In addition, evidence is brought forward {{of the presence}} in the cellular material from the pneumonic lung of a proteolytic <b>enzyme</b> <b>splitting</b> peptone to amino-acid nitrogen. This enzyme is operative at hydrogen ion concentrations from 8. 0 to 4. 8, but most active at 6. 3 or 5. 2. These findings may be regarded as having a bearing on resolution in pneumonia. During {{the course of the}} disease a gradual increase in the hydrogen ion concentration of the exudate probably takes place. With the breaking down of cellular material an enzyme digesting protein (fibrin) in weakly alkaline and weakly acid media may be liberated. With a gradual increase in the hydrogen ion concentration of the pneumonic lung the action of this enzyme probably ceases. An enzyme capable of splitting peptone to amino-acid nitrogen is probably active during the proteolysis of the fibrin and further activated when the hydrogen ion concentration of the pneumonic lung is increased to within its range of optimum activity at a pH of 6. 3 and 5. 2. By this means it may be conceived that the exudate is dissolved and resolution takes place...|$|E

30|$|G- 6 -Pase is {{considered}} to be a multifunctional enzyme which is a characteristic constituent of the endoplasmic reticulum.

Moreover, Moore and Halton (1975) reported that G- 6 -Pase is not present in the larval stages of Fasciola hepatica (redia and cercariae). This may be due to the ability of adult Platyhelminthes to release glucose from glycogen and gluconeogenic precursors (Burenina, 2009).

The GEL 1 gene encoding this enzyme was cloned and sequenced.

Both Avicelase and carboxymethyl cellulase {{activity was}} found to reside on a monomeric protein of 72 kD. Mg 2 + stabilized enzyme activity above 50 °C, and cysteine further enhanced the stabilizing effect of Mg 2 +. The enzyme exhibited hydrolyzing activities toward p-nitrophenyl-β-D-cellobioside, xylan, and some cellodextrins. The <b>enzyme</b> <b>splits</b> off only cellobiose (G 2) from microcrystalline cellulose and produced xylobiose, xylotetraose, and xylohexaose from the digestion of xylan. Hydrolysis of CM-cellulose takes place with a slow decrease in viscosity, and also with a slow liberation of reducing sugars, indicating an exoglucanase-like type of activity. However, when the enzyme's action pattern was further evaluated using defined soluble cellodextrins (DP 2 - 6) as substrates, it became obvious from the TLC data that the enzyme does not exclusively split off G 2 units from the oligomers. Cellotriose (G 3) runs cleaved into G 2 and glucose. Cellotetraose (G 4) was preferentially cleaved into G 2. Cellopentaose (G 5) yielded G 2 and G 3, which is slowly hydrolyzed to G 2 and glucose. Cellohexaose (G 6), however, was cleaved into G 3, G 2, and G 4.

Where mature extracellular herpes particles were found in association with cell membranes showing the enzyme activity, they were invariably likewise stained, and conversely, those mature particles which lay close against cells without reaction product at the surface were themselves free of it.

The present experiment {{was carried out}} {{to decide whether the}} same <b>enzyme</b> would <b>split</b> flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD). It turned out that esterpyrophosphatase was different from that which splitted FAD. The substrate solution was the mixture of FAD, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and riboflavine (FR) prepared from pig liver by extraction with physiological solution at 80 ℃ for 15 minutes. The original content of FAD in the substrate solution was estimated similarly after direct action of urine monoesterase and successive removal of FR. The extent of enzymatic FAD hydrolysis was measured as follows: After a definite time the pH of the test solution was adjusted to 5. 0 and heated at 80 ° for 15 minutes to interrupt the FAD hydrolysis. Then the mixture was added with urine phosphomonoesterase to convert either the produced or preformed FMN into FR. FR was removed by benzylalcohol extraction and the remaining FAD was measured by fluorometer after transformation to lumiflavin. Results are summarized as follows: 1) The previously reported crude esterpyrophosphatase active upon DPP at pH optima of 4. 0 and 8. 0, could split FAD at pH optima 8 - 9, but not in the acid medium. 2) Alkaline esterpyrophosphatase (optimum pH 8. 0) found in the insoluble fraction of that esterpyrophosphatase treated with HCl and NaOH was found incapable of splitting FAD. When that fraction was suspended in veronal buffer at pH 9. 0, warmed at 37 - for 2 hours and centrifuged, the supernatant contained alkaline esterpyrophosphatase but was incapable of splitting FAD at alkaline or acid medium.
