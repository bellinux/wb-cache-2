5|$|Much of {{the timber}} was reburied {{as the best}} way of {{preserving}} it, and a survey in 2005 found this to have been quite successful, despite reports warning of the area <b>drying</b> <b>out</b> and the peat coverage being reduced. The site is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage because of the risk to the buried timbers if the site dries out further.|$|E
5|$|The castle is {{protected}} as a Scheduled Monument under UK {{law and the}} remaining earthworks generally well preserved, but between 2010 and 2014 English Heritage expressed concerns about its condition {{and the impact of}} drainage, and the consequent <b>drying</b> <b>out</b> of the land, on the castle's earthworks. Only a handful of buildings survive in the castle's planned town of Skipsea Brough.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of C. diaphanus is {{extremely}} fast, and the species can only persist in pools without predators. The eggs tolerate <b>drying</b> <b>out,</b> and hatch when re-immersed in water. C. diaphanus was first reported in the scientific literature in 1704, but was only separated from other species and given its scientific name in 1803. The specific epithet diaphanus refers to the animal's transparency.|$|E
50|$|One {{can make}} a garden pond/ koi pond that {{generally}} ranges in size from 150 gallons to around 10,000 gallons. However, if evaporation exceeds {{the amount of water}} added, the pond may <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> during summer. This is not harmful biologically because many freshwater plants and animals (perhaps half of all species) are well adapted to periods of drought, and worldwide so-called 'temporary ponds' (ponds which usually <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> once a year) are an important natural habitat type. However, in a garden, a pond which <b>dries</b> <b>out</b> in summer may be a bit disappointing for the owner since this is the time when most people will be spending time enjoying their pond. And of course some animals, particularly fish, cannot survive periods of drought. Amphibians, on the other hand, often benefit from ponds which <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> because this removes the major predators of tadpoles and newtpoles (fish) and, provided the larvae emerge before the pond <b>dries</b> <b>out,</b> the drought presents no problems for the amphibians.|$|R
50|$|The female Aedes sollicitans lays {{her eggs}} on the <b>dried</b> <b>out</b> {{substrate}} of salt pannes, depressions within salt marshes which <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> between periods {{of very high}} tide (spring tide). The eggs hatch upon the panne filling at the next spring tide in 4-5 days with optimal conditions.|$|R
50|$|As wetland {{habitats}} <b>dry</b> <b>out,</b> {{the standing}} water may become stagnant and hypoxic. During this time mudfish will hang quietly {{at the surface}} with bubbles of air in their mouths to improve oxygen absorption. Some choose to leave hypoxic water before it <b>dries</b> <b>out,</b> and leave again if pushed back in.|$|R
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from <b>drying</b> <b>out</b> before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E
5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, a flock of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of the}} lake and then <b>drying</b> <b>out</b> their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E
5|$|The Australian pelican has two {{reproductive}} strategies {{depending on}} the local degree of environmental predictability. Colonies of tens or hundreds, rarely thousands, of birds breed regularly on small coastal and subcoastal islands where food is seasonally or permanently available. In arid inland Australia, especially in the endorheic Lake Eyre basin, pelicans will breed opportunistically in very large numbers of up to 50,000 pairs, when irregular major floods, which may be many years apart, fill ephemeral salt lakes and provide large amounts of food for several months before <b>drying</b> <b>out</b> again.|$|E
50|$|It {{prefers to}} grow in well-drained soils, that do not <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> during the summer.The shallow roots do not like intense summer heat, which <b>dries</b> <b>out</b> the soil. They are {{tolerate}} of soils containing limestone. They can grow in neutral to alkaline soils (with a pH level of between 6.6 and 8.5).|$|R

5000|$|The park also {{consists}} of a remnant of the swamps which used to cover the whole region, prevented the cultivation of the land, and caused malaria disease. These swamps were <b>dried</b> <b>out.</b> The park contains of many eucalyptus trees which were planted there {{in the early twentieth}} century in order to <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> the swamps.|$|R
5|$|The Chicago Park District, University of Chicago, and Art Institute of Chicago conservators all {{sponsored}} restoration work, including <b>drying</b> <b>out</b> {{the cavity}} of the hollow sculpture, {{removal of the}} deteriorated substructure, a newly designed ventilation system within the piece, a protective exterior coating, and repairs to the reflecting pool. In 1989 Chicago Park District allocated $150,000 to the repair project, which amount was matched by the Ferguson fund. By the end of 1991, the Park District had collected $320,000 of the $520,000 estimated repair costs from public and private funds, although in 1994 the sculpture still awaited repair.|$|E
5|$|Larvae of Sirex {{woodwasp}} develop through arrhenotoky: male larvae develop {{only from}} unfertilized eggs, the females only from fertilized ones. Usually, 10 males are produced per female, but the ratio varies between 20:1 and 1:1. The larvae hatch after eight {{days at the}} earliest, but in some exterior conditions, they may remain in the egg for several months. At the optimal temperature of around 25°C (77°F), they hatch out after 10 to 12 days. Although the larvae hatch at 30°C (86°F) {{two to three days}} earlier, they are 20% more likely to die. Such extreme temperatures result in slower development, and below 6.2°C (43°F), the larvae die. A sufficient interspersion of the wood with the mycelium of the woodwasp is crucial for its hatching, as the fungus prevents the wood from <b>drying</b> <b>out.</b> Without these prerequisites, hatching is not possible. The tree can only ward off the infestation if it floods the boreholes with resin or halts the fungus by producing a wall of polyphenols.|$|E
5|$|The modern koala is {{the only}} extant member of Phascolarctidae, a family that once {{included}} several genera and species. During the Oligocene and Miocene, koalas lived in rainforests and had less specialised diets. Some species, such as the Riversleigh rainforest koala (Nimiokoala greystanesi) and some species of Perikoala, were around {{the same size as}} the modern koala, while others, such as species of Litokoala, were one-half to two-thirds its size. Like the modern species, prehistoric koalas had well developed ear structures which suggests that long-distance vocalising and sedentism developed early. During the Miocene, the Australian continent began <b>drying</b> <b>out,</b> leading to the decline of rainforests and the spread of open Eucalyptus woodlands. The genus Phascolarctos split from Litokoala in the late Miocene and had several adaptations that allowed it to live on a specialised eucalyptus diet: a shifting of the palate towards the front of the skull; larger molars and premolars; smaller pterygoid fossa; and a larger gap between the molar and the incisor teeth.|$|E

5|$|When a drop {{of falling}} water hits the {{interior}} of the cup with the appropriate angle and velocity, the peridioles are ejected into the air by the force of the drop. The force of ejection tears open the purse, and results in the expansion of the funicular cord, formerly coiled under pressure in {{the lower part of the}} purse. The peridioles, followed by the highly adhesive funicular cord and basal hapteron, may hit a nearby plant stem or stick. The hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole. After <b>drying</b> <b>out,</b> the peridiole remains attached to the vegetation, where it may be eaten by a grazing herbivorous animal, and later deposited in that animal's dung to continue the life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian {{but there is a}} septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from <b>drying</b> <b>out</b> and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were scheduled to run before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted 90 minutes; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. The first session was held on a wet track from earlier morning rain and lap times reduced as the 90-minute period progressed due to the track <b>drying</b> <b>out.</b> No incidents were reported. Timo Bernhard in the No. 1 Porsche led the practice session in its final minutes with a lap time of one minute and 42.182 seconds, eight-tenths of a second faster than Marc Lieb in the sister entry. LMP2 was led by René Rast in G-Drive Racing's No. 26 Oreca 05 Nissan with a fastest timed lap of one minute and 51.617 seconds set in the session's final 15 minutes. The No. 51 AF Corse car driven by Gianmaria Bruni was fastest in LMGTE Pro while Rui Águas in the sister team's No. 83 entry helped the Italian marque to be the fastest vehicle in LMGTE Am.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the Devonian period (360 {{million years}} ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates, though some, such as Ichthyostega, may have {{sometimes}} hauled themselves out of the water. It is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs, dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal. In the early Carboniferous (360 to 345 million years ago), the climate became wet and warm. Extensive swamps developed with mosses, ferns, horsetails and calamites. Air-breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment. There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were {{at the top of the}} food chain, occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile. Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air, most still had a long tapering body and strong tail. They were the top land predators, sometimes reaching several metres in length, preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water. They still needed to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs, and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors. It was the development of the amniotic egg, which prevents the developing embryo from <b>drying</b> <b>out,</b> that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed.|$|E
5|$|The hoof of {{the horse}} {{contains}} over a dozen different structures, including bones, cartilage, tendons and tissues. The coffin or pedal bone is the major hoof bone, supporting {{the majority of the}} weight. Under the coffin bone is the navicular bone, itself cushioned by the navicular bursa, a fluid-filled sac. The digital cushion is a blood vessel-filled structure located {{in the middle of the}} hoof, which assists with blood flow throughout the leg. At the top of the hoof wall is the corium, tissue which continually produces the horn of the outer hoof shell, which is in turn protected by the periople, a thin outer layer which prevents the interior structures from <b>drying</b> <b>out.</b> The wall is connected to the coffin bone by sensitive laminae, a flexible layer which helps to suspend and protect the coffin bone. The main tendon in the hoof is the deep digital flexor tendon, which connects to the bottom of the coffin bone. The impact zone on the bottom of the hoof includes the sole, which has an outer, insensitive layer and a sensitive inner layer, and the frog, which lies between the heels and assists in shock absorption and blood flow. The final structures are the lateral cartilages, connected to the upper coffin bone, which act as the flexible heels, allowing hoof expansion. These structures allow the hoof to perform many functions. It acts as a support and traction point, shock absorber and system for pumping blood back through the lower limb.|$|E
25|$|The paste is kept covered {{after it}} has been used, in its {{original}} container (be it plastic or ceramic). It is kept in an environment away from direct sunlight and away from intense heat to prevent it from <b>drying</b> <b>out.</b> The paste for silk based pastes need to be stirred with a spatula every month or so to avoid the oil sinking down and <b>drying</b> <b>out</b> the paste as well as to prepare it for use. A good paste would produce a clear impression in one go; if the impression is not clear requiring further impressions then it indicates that the paste is either too dry or the cinnabar has been depleted.|$|E

50|$|Scholars like Raikes (1968) and Suraj Bhan (1972, 1973, 1975, 1977) {{have shown}} that based on archaeological, geomorphic and sedimentological {{research}} the Yamuna may have flowed into the Sarasvati during Harappan times. There are several <b>dried</b> <b>out</b> river beds (paleochannels) between the Sutlej and the Yamuna, some of them two to ten kilometres wide. They are not always visible on the ground because of excessive silting and encroachment by sand of the <b>dried</b> <b>out</b> river channels.
