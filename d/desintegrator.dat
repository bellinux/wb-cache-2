D. Orton, C. saccharo-myces P. D. Orton, and C. martinii P. D. Orton. A new species, C. laanii Kits van Wav. is described. A regrouping of and key to the ‘stercorarius group ’ is given and mainly based on spore characters. It is argued that C. cineratus Quél, and C. tuberosus Quél, are conspecific with C. stercorarius as originally described by Fries and that C. velox Godey (= C. stercorarius Fr. sensu Kühn. & Romagn.) belongs to this group. Coprinus saccharomyces P. D. Orton {{was found to be}} identical with the 2 -spored form of C. stercorarius (Scop.) ex Fr., which —as such—was hitherto unknown. The ultrasonic <b>desintegrator</b> helped to explain the nature of the black dots on the spores of C. narcoticus and C. laanii, which are believed to be caused by the wrinkling ofthe perisporial sac.
