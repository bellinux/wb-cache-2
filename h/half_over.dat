Many of the barrows have been damaged by more recent activities. The remains of strip lynchets of 'Celtic' fields have been found near a few of the barrows.

5|$|The English {{people are}} a British people. Some genetic {{evidence}} suggests that 75–95% descend in the paternal line from prehistoric settlers who originally came from the Iberian Peninsula, {{as well as a}} 5% contribution from Angles and Saxons, and a significant Scandinavian (Viking) element. However, other geneticists place the Germanic estimate up to <b>half.</b> <b>Over</b> time, various cultures have been influential: Prehistoric, Brythonic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Viking (North Germanic), Gaelic cultures, as well as a large influence from Normans. There is an English diaspora in former parts of the British Empire; especially the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Since the late 1990s, many English people have migrated to Spain.|$|E

Cancellara {{dominated}} the time trial event and won {{by a margin of}} close a minute and a <b>half</b> <b>over</b> the second-place finisher. This was Cancellara's third world championship in the time trial discipline, which was tied for most ever with Australia's Michael Rogers. Cancellara's next goal was the road race, which was to take place three days later. During the final lap of the race, Cancellara crossed the gap to the race's leading group that had just formed. At the bottom of the final climb Cadel Evans (Australia) attacked, but no other riders reacted. Cancellara crossed the line in fifth.|$|E

25|$|The axis of {{symmetry}} of a two-dimensional figure is a line such that, if a perpendicular is constructed, any two points lying on the perpendicular at equal distances from the {{axis of symmetry}} are identical. Another {{way to think about}} it is that if the shape were to be folded in <b>half</b> <b>over</b> the axis, the two halves would be identical: the two halves are each other's mirror image. Thus a square has four axes of symmetry, because there are four different ways to fold it and have the edges all match. A circle has infinitely many axes of symmetry passing through its center, for the same reason.|$|E

She liked to pursue him but he did not appreciate her advances. Since Ann Wedgeworth did not appreciate her diminishing role in the series, Lana was dropped from the show without any explanation before the season was <b>half</b> <b>over.</b> The other new addition that fall was the new building manager, Ralph Furley (played by Don Knotts), whose brother Bart bought the building from the Ropers. Mr. Furley pursued Lana unsuccessfully, as she unsuccessfully pursued Jack. Unlike Lana, Mr. Furley appeared until the end of the series.|$|E
25|$|The long through ball: This is a long, {{and usually}} high, pass from a teams' own <b>half,</b> <b>over</b> {{the heads of}} the other team's defence. It is {{intended}} for the attacking players to chase and it is important that they remain in an onside position until the ball is kicked. The tactic works best with strong and fast forwards who will {{have a good chance of}} winning back the ball, taking control over it, and eventually getting a shot on goal. In the diagram, the ball (red line) is played in front of the furthermost forward, the dotted blue line showing their run. In this example, a through-ball pass along the ground would be picked up by one of the defenders (black team) because the gap between the two central defenders is too small.|$|E

The Australians won the game easily by an innings inside two days, but Davies scored a personal success by taking six Australian wickets for 80 runs in the Australian innings.

25|$|BUA {{had built}} up the high cost base of a major {{scheduled}} airline while low-yield charter traffic, {{a substantial amount of}} which was fluctuating, low-margin short-haul trooping between the UK and Germany, constituted a large part of its business. On the other hand, scheduled services generated inadequate revenues, which were insufficient to support the airline. Simultaneous development of new scheduled services and integration of existing regional operations in the Channel Islands and on the Isle of Man with the vehicle ferry network proved a costly distraction for overburdened senior sales and commercial managers, taking up a disproportionate amount of their time. Although revenues and the workforce had doubled between 1962 and 1968, total output had risen by less than <b>half</b> <b>over</b> the same period. This translated into a substantial fall in output per employee within that time span and resulted in a weak trading position.|$|E

Detroit did not renew his contract, and the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a team coached by Paul Brown, picked him up.

Brown was pleasantly surprised by his abilities on defense. [...] "Tommy always was a pretty good man on defense at Massillon and Ohio State", he said in 1948.
