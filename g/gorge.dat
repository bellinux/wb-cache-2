5|$|Longleat Estate has fenced off a {{large part}} of its land and has {{introduced}} goats, as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the <b>gorge</b> until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release a flock of sheep on its side of the <b>gorge</b> for the same purpose, but will first consult local residents and interested parties on whether to fence off the <b>gorge</b> or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. There is already a small flock of feral Soay sheep in the <b>gorge.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Richard William Howard <b>Gorges</b> {{was from}} the Irish branch of the <b>Gorges</b> family that had settled in England from Normandy in the 12th century. His great-{{great-grandfather}} was <b>Gorges</b> Edmond Howard, his great-grandfather was Captain Hamilton <b>Gorges</b> of Kilbrew and Ballygowley M.P. and his father was Major John Arthur Howard <b>Gorges.</b> [...] His mother, Mary Kelly, was a published author and poet who was descended from Arthur French of French Park, County Roscommon.|$|R
5|$|The <b>gorge</b> is {{susceptible}} to flooding. In the Chew Stoke flood of 1968 {{the flow of water}} washed large boulders down the <b>gorge,</b> damaging the cafe and entrance to Gough's Cave and washing away cars. In the cave itself the flooding lasted for three days. In 2012 the B3135, the road through the <b>gorge,</b> was closed for several weeks following damage to the road surface during extensive flooding.|$|E
5|$|The <b>gorge,</b> {{which helped}} protect Bristol Harbour, has been quarried for stone {{to build the}} city, and its {{surrounding}} land has been protected from development as The Downs and Leigh Woods. The Avon estuary and the <b>gorge</b> are the county boundary with North Somerset, and the river flows into the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth. Another <b>gorge,</b> cut by the Hazel Brook (which flows into the River Trym), crosses the Blaise Castle estate in northern Bristol.|$|E
5|$|The steep <b>gorge</b> walls make {{an ideal}} habitat for {{peregrine}} falcons, with a plentiful {{supply of food}} nearby {{in the form of}} pigeons and sea gulls. Peregrines have a history of nesting in the <b>gorge,</b> but having become rare in the British Isles they did not breed and were rarely seen in the <b>gorge</b> after the 1930s. In 1990 Peregrines returned to the <b>gorge,</b> and have successfully bred in most of the following years. On warm days a strong uplift forms in the <b>gorge,</b> on which birds of prey soar while hunting. The <b>gorge</b> also houses large populations of Jackdaw and horseshoe bats, both of which find homes in the caves and bridge buttresses.|$|E

5|$|The steep {{walls of}} the <b>gorge</b> support some rare fauna and flora, {{including}} species unique to the <b>gorge.</b> There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts's whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol rock cress, Bristol onion, spiked speedwell, autumn squill and honewort. Because of its steep sides, there are {{many parts of the}} <b>gorge</b> on which trees cannot grow, making way for smaller plants. The <b>gorge</b> is also home to rare invertebrate species. The <b>gorge</b> has a microclimate around 1 degree warmer than the surrounding land. The steep south-west facing sides receive the afternoon sunlight, but are partially sheltered from the prevailing winds. When winds come from the Bristol Channel in the north west they may be funnelled into the <b>gorge,</b> creating harsh and wet conditions.|$|E
5|$|There is a clifftop {{walk from}} Jacob's Ladder along {{the crest of}} the <b>gorge</b> and back to the road, with views of the <b>gorge.</b> A caving {{experience}} is offered within Gough's Cave.

A watchtower at the top provides a 360–degree view of the entire area and village. An open-top bus tour operates during the summer. Cheddar cheese is made in the lower part of the <b>gorge.</b>|$|E

5|$|After this, {{the lands}} of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois.
