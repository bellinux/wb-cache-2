40|$|This paper uses 1990 Census data {{to study}} the effects <b>of</b> {{immigrant}} <b>inflows</b> on the labor market opportunities of natives and older immigrants. I divide new immigrants, older immigrants, and natives into distinct skill groups and focus on skill-group-specific outcomes within cities. An important first question is" whether <b>inflows</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> immigrants lead to outflows of natives or earlier immigrants in the same skill groups. Even after accounting for endogenous mobility decisions I find that inter-city migration flows of natives and older immigrants are largely" unaffected by <b>new</b> immigrant <b>inflows.</b> <b>Inflows</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> immigrants are associated with lower employment rates among natives and earlier immigrants, but with relatively small effects on the relative wage structure. The estimates imply that immigrant arrivals between 1985 and 1990 depressed the employment rate of low-skilled natives in major U. S. cities by 1 - 2 percentage points on average, and by substantially more in high-immigrant cities. ...|$|R

In October 1999, the Home launched the Project for New Arrivals in Shatin so as to provide various supporting services to the new arrival children and their families.

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{is described}} which tests between various equilibrium theories of unemployment using matching data. The Paper shows how to correct econometrically for temporal aggregation effects, where the econometrician’s {{aim is to}} identify a matching process using data which is recorded monthly, and also shows how to identify different unemployment theories on the data. As implementing this test requires information on the <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> vacancies over time, this Paper uses employment agency data for the UK over the period 1985 - 99. Although the standard random matching approach provides a reasonably good fit, the empirical evidence provides greater support for ‘stock-flow’ matching. Estimates find that over this period, around 87 % of newly laid-off workers are on the long-side of their markets and so match with the flow <b>of</b> <b>new</b> vacancies as those vacancies come onto the market. In particular, these workers experience average durations of unemployment which exceed six months and their matching rates are highly correlated with the <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> vacancies. This job queue interpretation of the matching data {{has important implications for}} government policy on long term unemployment and optimal UI. It also suggests that previous estimates of the so-called matching function have been misspecified, which potentially explains the large variation in results obtained in that literature...|$|R

40|$|Foreign {{investment}} management firms have recently {{started to play}} a major role in the investment trust business in Japan. In terms of assets under management, their size and market share have almost doubled in the past several years. In part, the relative success of foreign managed firms in attracting market share may be attributed to the fact that Japanese investment trusts have underperformed benchmarks in quite a dramatic fashion over the past two decades. This is at best indirect evidence that Japanese funds under perform their foreign counterparts. In a recent paper (Brown, Goetzmann, Hiraki, Otsuki and Shiraishi 2001) we show that the under performance can be attributed almost entirely to the unique tax environment of Japanese investment trusts, which had the effect of heavily penalizing early withdrawals. The relaxation of these regulations coincided with a major <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> money into the investment trust business. We examine the relative performance of Japanese and foreign {{investment management}} firms before and after this change in tax regulations, and find that the poor relative performance of Japanese funds from April 2000 through December 2001 may in part be attributed to the huge <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> money into this sector and the style shifts made necessary to accommodate this flow. ...|$|R

The results show that price discrimination is more prevalent in competitive markets and among newspapers with low market shares.

In addition, we find weak evidence that newspapers in markets with large <b>inflows</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> consumers and those covering wide geographical areas offer more discounts. newspapers; oligopoly; price discrimination...|$|R
