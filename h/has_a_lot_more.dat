[...] As a senior, Larkins played against Gordon Bell, Archie Griffin, and Ricky Bell of USC. [...] Larkins said: [...] "Gordon Bell was the best of the three. [...] He was a super tough runner and a tough guy to make a solid tackle on. [...] Gordon <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> speed and more moves than Archie does, and I thought he was a better all around player." ...|$|E

Lead singer Gomez said, [...] "The video is very different from any other video that I've done," [...] and added, [...] "it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> fierce clothes and a lot of fun colors." [...] Two alternate video versions were released for the Ralphi Rosario Remix and the Dave Audé Remix. The video features Gomez sporting different outfits and appearing on black, red, and pink backdrops with the band performing the song. The music video was directed by Chris Dooley. Chris Ryan of MTV News called Gomez a [...] "dancing queen" [...] and said that she [...] "seems cool and confident throughout the video." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{received}} acclaim for {{the quality}} of their songwriting. Daniel Durchholz of Wall of Sound called Holy Wood their most ambitious and musically accomplished record to date. LA Weekly said that [...] "almost all [...] contain a double-take chord change or a textural overdose or a mind-blowing bridge, and they'll be terroristic in concert." [...] Hot Press praised the band for their inventive musical arrangements, and said that [...] "Holy Wood is a far better record than many would have dared to expect." [...] Drowned in Sound rated the album 10 out of 10 and praised the band's performance, saying that they [...] "play tighter than [...] before (looking at the credits show it to be much more of a team effort)... and, musically, it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> variation and scope than the Limp Bizkits of the world." [...] The band's vocalist was also applauded for his lyricism; Barry Walters of Rolling Stone commended him for [...] "addressing real-life issues with a theatrical verve and genuine vitriol that no other mainstream act can match." [...] Billboard magazine was similarly impressed, calling Manson one of the most skilled lyricists of his generation. Revolver editor Christopher Scapelliti compared his lyrics to those of John Lennon's, writing: [...] "What comes across loudest on the album is not the music, but the sense of injury expressed in Manson's lyrics. Like Plastic Ono Band, Holy Wood screams with a primal fury that's evident even in its quietest moments." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{development}} of [...] "This Love", the band {{stated that the}} song was influenced by musician Stevie Wonder. The piece {{was written in the}} key of C minor, the metre is set in common time, and the piece's tempo is a moderate 95 beats per minute. The introduction of [...] "This Love" [...] features a piano-led strut. Maroon 5 has called [...] "This Love" [...] a prime pop-rock song. The music featured in the song <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> rock-guitar crunch, and is considered a soulful and pop/rock song. According to Johnny Loftus of Allmusic, the music featured in the song has [...] "a slick channeling of vintage R rhythms into punchy pop dynamics". Loftus felt that the song features [...] "Levine's wry falsetto around strutting, bottom-heavy piano and percussion both programmed and live; chirping backup vocals and washes of sunny synth and flute acted as counterweights". Loftus also noted that the band has a [...] "sexual charge" [...] with the lyrics, [...] "I tried my best to feed her appetite / To keep her coming every night / So hard to keep her satisfied". The Boston Globe's Steve Morse described the single's sounds as [...] "a rocking yet soulful tale about the breakup of a relationship". Meghan Bard of The Daily Campus adds that the song has [...] "Stevie Wonder-esque vocals and a funky R beat". In the extended version of the song, which is 4 minutes and 26 seconds long, the chorus of the band's next single, [...] "She Will Be Loved", can be heard from 3:21 to 3:42, during the outro.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{has been}} {{generally}} well received, being praised by many critics for its writing. In a 2009 review for Slate, Josh Levin wrote that [...] "The greatness of 'Stark Raving Dad' <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> {{to do with}} The Simpsons writing staff than with Jackson's voice-over talents. The show's scripters {{came up with a}} plot device far more ingenious than simply dropping the singer into Springfield." [...] Monica Collins of the Boston Herald also enjoyed the episode. On the day it first aired, she wrote that [...] "This episode is vintage Simpsons, crammed with divinely vulgar visual oddities. And Michael Jackson, of course, is just so weird anyway that he fits right in." [...] Mark Lorando of The Times-Picayune commented that [...] "throwaway lines on The Simpsons are funnier than the big punchlines on most so-called comedy series; [...] has layers of humor, satirical touches that enrich the story lines," [...] singling out jokes like the America's Funniest Home Video parody. [...] "The laughs are literally non-stop, and Jackson's unmistakable vocal presence [...] adds a thousand watts of star power." [...] In 2011, Television Blend's Eric Eisenberg named [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] the best episode of the entire series. He praised it for being heartful and stated that what [...] "prevents the episode from seeming artificial or manipulative is that the writing in the episode earns the earnest moments", and further elaborates that while [...] "strong emotions might be the hallmark of 'Stark Raving Dad,' it would be a sincere mistake to ignore how funny it is." [...] He concluded that the episode [...] "is perfectly constructed, is filled with both deep belly laughs and tears, and is simply the greatest episode of The Simpsons" ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} many {{different}} factors adding to complexity of the campaign, ActionTrip noting that [...] "Medieval adds a new strategic balance to the game, which teaches that great empires come with an even greater responsibility". Eurogamer praised the way the player had to manage production queues, guard the loyalty of important generals and make use of spies and assassins, calling the level of control [...] "far ahead of anything seen in the previous game"; many other reviews shared a similar view. The number of factions in the game, each with their own historically accurate units and territories, was commended, with IGN and Game Informer stating it [...] "gives the game huge replay value", with GameSpot adding [...] "the strategic portion now <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> options". Many reviewers gave praise to the fact the historical setting of the Middle Ages {{was said to be}} well integrated into the game; PC Zone acknowledging the [...] "brutality and instability" [...] of the era is well included in the game, with GameSpot praising the religion in the game, [...] "religion played an enormous role in shaping history, and so it is in the game". GameSpy stated that the different historical starting positions made the games attention to detail [...] "impressive and noteworthy"; the historical battle system was also highly received from Computer Gaming World, stating that they successfully [...] "provide an authentic glimpse of the past". However, GameSpot commented on a problem with a lack of information, [...] "you'll have a tough time keeping track of all the goings-on in your provinces", suggesting this could be solved through a more informative interface. Overall, reviewers highly complimented the strategic gameplay, many saying it was similar to a Civilization-style game.|$|E
500|$|The PC port {{was also}} well-received. Lee Buchanan of PC Gamer US praised [...] "the {{spectacular}} visuals that bring to life the most jarring collisions I've {{seen on a}} computer", and he noted that [...] " [...] damage is depicted beautifully". Like Lucas, he wrote that the player [...] "can't just mindlessly smash into other cars; this is thinking man's destruction". Although he found the game too easy [...] "even at the toughest difficulty level", he found {{this to be a}} minor issue that did not detract from the experience. He considered the game's online play to be a high point, and he finished, [...] "Destruction Derby is a blast, and a welcome change of pace from high-end driving simulations." [...] Peter Olafson of Computer Gaming World called the game [...] "a great simulation" [...] of demolition derbies, and he wrote that the wrecks are [...] "convulsive and realistic". He believed that the game [...] "has never-before-seen quality that will instantly make it a showpiece game to demonstrate to open-mouthed friends and relatives", and he considered the car damage to be [...] "especially marvelous—and unprecedented for this sort of game". However, he found that its [...] "useful life span is surprisingly short" [...] and he hoped for a track editor in its sequel. He summarised, [...] "Despite its limitations, this is a great game, but it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> potential." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation remarked that while the game is a straight port of the PlayStation version, it is an impeccably accurate one. He applauded the authentic modelling of vehicle crashes, multiple modes, smoothness of gameplay, and inclusion of both network and modem options, and found the game's only downside is that the camera zooms out so little that {{it can be difficult to}} see nearby cars.|$|E

2500|$|Still {{determined}} to get the album out, Swervedriver forwent signing with one of two other interested major labels and instead opted for independent label Zero Hour Records out of New York. They officially released 99th Dream, their fourth album, on 24 February 1998. The band also formed their own label, Sonic Wave Discs (SWD), and on 10 August 1998 issued the album in the UK. About the album's progression to a more indie rock style, Franklin told The Star-Ledger, [...] "It wasn't a conscious decision. [...] {{just the way it}} was going – concise little pop songs, bossa nova beats and such." [...] He continued, [...] "I've always liked the idea that you don't always know where it's coming from... all about time. It's all over the place. I didn't put too much thought into it, which may be good. You're fueling more from the subconscious that way." [...] In an interview for Mean Street magazine, Hindmarsh mentioned, [...] "There's a track called 'She Weaves a Tender Trap.' That's like a one-take, all-four-of-us thing, and it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> air in it, a lot more space. Whereas in the past, we used to try and fill every single hole.
