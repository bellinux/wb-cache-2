40|$|AbstractThe {{classroom}} use {{of independent}} reading primarily {{grew out of}} concerns for students’ reading achievements. Various {{studies have indicated that}} engagement in Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) improves not only students’ reading skills but also their attitude towards reading itself, an activity that many rarely associate with pleasure. SSR is a programme {{based on the belief that}} self-selection, among other factors, motivates learners to read with interest and works towards helping them feel that reading is an oasis rather than a burden. In turn, this produced other benefits; beyond improving students’ attitude towards reading, silent reading programmes have also helped learners in terms of spelling, writing and vocabulary gains, as well as in developing their reading speed and reading comprehension skills (Birmingham, 2006; Gardiner, 2001; Weller and Weller, 1999; Arthur, 1995; Dwyer and West, 1994; Krashen, 1993).

A number of obvious patterns were found: The police are highly news worthy and police reporting is routine in all news media.

About seven out of ten stories are neutral descriptions, a fifth (18 per cent) are negative news, while explicitly positive values are found in thirteen per cent of the material. The negative stories deals mainly either with individual police officers who have engaged in criminal activity, with insufficient resources or the allegedly defunct organization. Critically scrutinizing news is hardly found at all. The typical news media image of the police is that of the police, or the police officer, simply doing their job.

40|$|Ao analisar o funcionamento da linguagem, Wittgenstein, nas Investigações Filosóficas, problematizou, por um lado, os sistemas filosóficos modernos, que se apoiaram em um ideal de racionalidade unidimensional, pois consideraram a razão, o único meio de se alcançar o conhecimento verdadeiro e, por outro lado, colocou em dúvida a linguagem como estrutura de representação firmemente estabelecida e seu uso instrumentalizado. Nessa análise, o filósofo descreveu a categoria jogos de linguagem e seus usos nas mais diversas formas de vida em contraposição ao ensino ostensivo assegurado na concepção agostiniana de linguagem. Wittgenstein considerou que a teoria referencial compreendia a linguagem como um sistema logicamente estruturado, reduzido ao exercício da designação, enquanto que os jogos de linguagem permitiam, à linguagem, uma infinidade de funções. Dessa forma, ao invés de nos atermos a uma única forma de expressão dos pensamentos, podemos utilizar inúmeras maneiras de pensar os problemas que nos afligem. Embora Wittgenstein não tenha elaborado uma Filosofia da Educação, suas críticas ao ensino ostensivo e a caracterização da categoria jogos de linguagem parecem evidenciar a complexidade da linguagem, quando nos remetemos à discussão de seus limites. Essas críticas e categoria, depreendidas de sua filosofia, ao nosso ver, fornecem elementos para que os educadores se contraponham à unidimensionalidade da razão e do uso na linguagem pelas teorias e práticas pedagógicas, no presente, levando-os a refletir sobre os seus limites e, quem sabe, a possibilidade de pensá-las em sua multiplicidade. Analyzing the {{language}} working, Wittgenstein, in Philosophical Investigations, put in doubt the modern philosophical systems, {{that based on}} a model of unidimensional reason because it considers the reason {{the only way to}} reach the true knowledge and, otherwise, he placed in doubt {{the language}} as structure of representation firmly fixed and how its is used. In this study of facts, the philosopher related the category language games and its uses in differents life forms in contraposition to the ostensive teaching insured on the agostiniana’s conception of language. Wittgenstein considered that the referential theory had comprised the language as a structured system, reduced to exercise of designation, and the language games let, to the language, an infinity of functions. This way, opposite to cling to the only form of expression of the thoughts, we can use many ways of thinking about the problems we have fear. Although Wittgenstein hadn’t elaborated a Philosophy of the Education, his <b>discernments</b> about the ostensive education and the characterization of the category language games look to evidence the language complexity, when we refer to the discussion of his limits. Those <b>discernments</b> and category, deduced of his philosophy, in our point of view, give elements for the teachers compare to the unidimensionality of the reason and of the use in the language by theories and pedagogic practices, at the present time, taking them to think about their limits and, maybe, the possibility of thinking about its multiplicity. We can, in this dissertation, to think about the own questions of the education when we relate the referential language to the possibilities of communication limited to the transmission of formulated knowledges and, the language games, to the condition of plural possibilities, that consider the differents uses of the language in the educative activity...|$|R
