5000|$|The Kaveri engine {{has been}} {{specifically}} designed for the demanding Indian operating environment, which ranges from hot desert to the highest mountain range in the world. Its design is a variable-cycle, <b>flat-rated</b> <b>engine</b> and has 13 percent higher thrust than the General Electric F404-GE-F2J3 engines equipping India's Tejas prototypes. The GTRE's design envisions achieving a fan pressure ratio of 4:1 and an overall pressure ratio of 27:1, which it believes will permit the Tejas to [...] "supercruise" [...] (cruise supersonically {{without the use of}} the afterburner).|$|E

50|$|During 1980, SIAI Marchetti {{performed}} {{the first flight}} of an turboprop-powered SF.260TP, powered by a Allison Model 250 <b>engine</b> <b>flat-rated</b> at 350 shp. This variant was marketed towards the military trainer market, which soon adopted the type. In August 1986, Gates Learjet were approached by SIAI Marchetti to modify the SF.260TP {{for it to be}} compliant with the requirements of Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) FAR Part 23, thus allowing it to be certified for civil use. Modifications were made in order to achieve lower stall speed and greater payload capacity, these performance improvements were principally achieved through aerodynamic alterations, such as the adoption of 'shark's teeth' along the wing's leading edge.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{model of}} the SF.260 was powered by a single Lycoming O-540 engine, capable of providing 260 hp of thrust. The standard model made use of a carburetor, while fully aerobatic models featured fuel injection instead. The SF.260 {{has been described as}} having the power to be immune to the gyration-like effects of turbulence and possessing a high rate of climb. During the 1980s, aerospace publication Flying Magazine stated the SF.260 to be: [...] "the fastest normally aspirated piston single in production". The SF.260 holds the airspeed records for aircraft in its class over the 100 km and 1,000 km closed circuits. Later-built models often made use of turboprop engines; the initial model to be equipped as such, designated as the SF.260TP, was powered by a single Allison Model 250 <b>engine,</b> <b>flat-rated</b> at 350 shp.|$|R
