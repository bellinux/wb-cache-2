After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a <b>joint</b> <b>session</b> <b>of</b> Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.

Two days later, in a nationally {{televised}} address to a <b>joint</b> <b>session</b> <b>of</b> Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda. Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based {{on the theory that}} a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.|$|E

The official tally of the state's electoral votes was submitted with an invalid seal (bearing the coat of arms {{of the office of}} the Secretary of the State of Arkansas versus the seal of the state of Arkansas bearing the state arms).|$|E
5|$|After his inauguration, Obama {{announced}} to a <b>joint</b> <b>session</b> <b>of</b> Congress in February 2009 his intent {{to work with}} Congress to construct a plan for healthcare reform. By July, a series of bills were approved by committees within the House of Representatives. On the Senate side, from June to September, the Senate Finance Committee {{held a series of}} 31 meetings to develop a healthcare reform bill. This group—in particular, Democrats Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman and Kent Conrad, along with Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe—met for more than 60 hours, and the principles that they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of the Senate healthcare reform bill.|$|E
5|$|After the {{terrorist}} attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the NDA government passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The aim of the act was to improve the government's {{ability to deal with}} terrorism. It initially failed to pass in the Rajya Sabha; therefore, the NDA took the extraordinary step of convening a <b>joint</b> <b>session</b> <b>of</b> the Parliament, where the numerical superior Lok Sabha allowed the bill to pass. The act was subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused of terrorism. However, it was criticised by opposition parties and scholars for being an infringement upon civil liberties, and the National Human Rights Commission stated that it had been used to target Muslims. It was later repealed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2004.|$|E

5|$|On {{his trip}} to Israel in October 1985, Weizsäcker was greeted on arrival by his Israeli counterpart, President Chaim Herzog. The {{president}} was given a full honor-guard welcome at Ben-Gurion Airport; among Cabinet ministers who lined up {{to shake his hand}} were right-wingers of the Herut party, the main faction of Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party, who had previously refused to greet German leaders. Weizsäcker's visit was the first by a head of state, but not the first by a West German leader, as Chancellor Willy Brandt had paid a visit to Israel in June 1973. During a four-day state visit to the United Kingdom in July 1986, Weizsäcker addressed a <b>joint</b> <b>session</b> <b>of</b> the Houses of Parliament, the first German to be accorded that honor.|$|E
5|$|One of Breckinridge's final acts as {{vice-president}} was {{announcing the}} vote of the Electoral College to a <b>joint</b> <b>session</b> <b>of</b> Congress on February 13, 1861. Rumors abounded that he would tamper with the vote to prevent Lincoln's election. Knowing that some legislators planned to attend the session armed, Breckinridge asked Winfield Scott to post guards {{in and around the}} chambers. One legislator raised a point of order, requesting that the guards be ejected, but Breckinridge refused to sustain it; the electoral vote proceeded, and Breckinridge announced Lincoln's election as president. After Lincoln's arrival in Washington, D.C., on February 24, Breckinridge visited him at the Willard Hotel. After making a valedictory address on March 4, he swore in Hannibal Hamlin as his successor as vice president; Hamlin then swore in Breckinridge and the other incoming senators.|$|E
5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's {{challenges}} to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The {{members of the committee}} were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate was limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a <b>joint</b> <b>session</b> <b>of</b> the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House would preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary.

5|$|In {{the general}} {{elections}} of 1967, Reddy {{was elected to}} the Lok Sabha from Hindupur in Andhra Pradesh. On 17 March 1967, Reddy was elected Speaker of the Fourth Lok Sabha becoming only the third person to be elected Speaker of the house during their inaugural term. To emphasize the independence of the Speaker's office, Reddy resigned from the Congress Party. His term as Speaker was marked by several firsts including the admission of a No-Confidence Motion on the same day as the President's address to a <b>joint</b> <b>session</b> <b>of</b> Parliament, the handing down of a sentence of imprisonment for Contempt {{of the house and the}} setting up of the Committee on the Welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. During his term as Speaker a defamation suit filed against him by an MP resulted in the Supreme Court's ruling that parliamentarians had complete freedom of speech in the House and that the courts had no say in such matters. Reddy described his role as being the 'watchman of the Parliament'. He however had several hostile encounters with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the House that proved costly when he became, two years later, the Congress Party's nominee to succeed Zakir Hussain as President.|$|E
5|$|When the {{official}} tally was announced, Taylor had {{won by a}} vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel allies, it voted 2–1 to certify the announced vote tally. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Goebel announced his decision to contest the board's decision to the General Assembly. The Assembly appointed a committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges. The members of the committee were drawn at random, though the drawing was likely rigged – only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) Among the rules the General Assembly adopted for the contest committee were: that the committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate be limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a <b>joint</b> <b>session</b> <b>of</b> the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House preside over the joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary.

5|$|On 6 April 1960, Heffron {{attempted}} {{to send the}} bill back to the council, which returned it to the assembly on the same grounds as before. As {{a result of the}} deadlock, Heffron requested the Governor to order a <b>joint</b> <b>session</b> <b>of</b> parliament on 20 April, a session which lasted two hours and was boycotted by the opposition. On 12 May the Assembly resolved that the bill be submitted for a referendum. However, later that day the leader of the opposition in the Legislative Council, Hector Clayton, started legal action against the government on the grounds that under section 5B of the NSW Constitution, the council had neither voted nor deliberated on the bill and thus the bill could not be submitted for a referendum. In the case of Clayton v. Heffron (1960) a majority of the full bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (headed by Chief Justice Evatt) found in favour of the government four to one {{on the grounds that they}} had complied fully with the intention of section 5B, while also denying the plaintiff leave to appeal to the High Court. The subsequent appeal to the New South Wales Court of Appeal was rejected by Chief Judge in Equity McLelland on 10 October. In a subsequent case to the High Court, Clayton argued that section 15 of the Commonwealth Constitution, which dealt with the process by which state parliaments filled senate vacancies, entrenched the requirement for such parliaments to be bicameral on account of its exclusive mention of both houses. This was rejected by the court that affirmed that the mention did not exclude the right of state parliaments to do as they saw fit regarding abolition or reform.|$|E
