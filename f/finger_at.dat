5|$|Some players {{remained}} {{resentful of}} Craig's dubious elevation ahead of Harvey during the 1957–58 tour of South Africa but appreciated {{that he had}} not promoted himself and that he was fair and open to input from teammates. On the tour, Harvey broke a <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> catching practice and missed the early tour matches. After it healed, Harvey returned for a match against a South African XI, in a virtual dress rehearsal for the Tests. He scored 173 as the tourists crushed their hosts by an innings.|$|E
5|$|On September 23, 2011, the NBA {{canceled}} training camp, {{which was}} to begin October 3, and {{the first week of}} preseason games, which were to run October 9 through 15. The incident marks {{only the second time in}} league history that games have been lost to a labor stoppage. Both the owners and the union had planned to meet on September 30 in New York and pledged to continue through the weekends if progress was being made. A source close to the situation leaked to ESPN that Stern plans to threaten the cancellation of the season if no deal is made, but the union sees this as a scare tactic and not a serious threat. Commentators speculated that Stern wants to put pressure on the players and prevent negotiation from dragging through the fall. The meeting on September 30 was tense as Dwyane Wade reportedly yelled at Stern after he pointed his <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Wade. The players nearly stormed out, but they remained in the meeting only after Hunter asked them to. Stern also backed down from his earlier threat that he would cancel the season if there is no deal.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{switched}} to Dunlop tires for the 1982 season, as Goodyear {{pulled out of}} motorcycle racing. New competition had arrived as Honda entered their new two-stroke NS500 ridden by defending champion Lucchinelli, former 350cc world champion, Takazumi Katayama and newcomer Freddie Spencer. Roberts won the season-opening round in Argentina on the old square-four Yamaha, but then {{switched to}} the new OW61 YZR500 V4 engined bike. He came in third at the Austrian Grand Prix then, sat out the French Grand Prix at Nogaro as {{he and the other}} top riders boycotted the race over unsafe track conditions. Roberts then won the Spanish Grand Prix at Jarama ahead of Sheene, and scored a second place behind Suzuki rider Franco Uncini in the Netherlands. In a portent of things to come, Roberts was leading the Belgian Grand Prix when his Dunlop tires lost their grip and he had to settle for fourth place as Spencer went on to win his first Grand Prix for Honda. Roberts then injured his knee and <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the British Grand Prix and had to miss the Swedish round, but by then the world championship had been claimed by Uncini with a total of five victories while Roberts fell to fourth place. By the end of the 1982 season, Roberts had won sixteen 500cc Grand Prix races, more than double that of any of his contemporaries.|$|E

25|$|A {{serious effort}} was made in 1668 to secure a scheme of comprehension, with William Bates, Richard Baxter and Thomas Manton for the dissenters meeting Wilkins and Hezekiah Burton. Wilkins felt the Presbyterians could be brought within the Church of England, while the Independent separatists were left outside. It fell through by late summer, with Manton blaming John Owen for {{independent}} scheming for general toleration with Buckingham, and Baxter pointing the <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the House of Lords.|$|E
25|$|However, the aye-aye {{is often}} viewed as a harbinger of evil and killed on sight. Others believe, if one points its narrowest <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> someone, they are marked for death.

The Sakalava people go so far as to claim aye-ayes sneak into houses through the thatched roofs and murder the sleeping occupants by using their middle finger to puncture the victim's aorta.|$|E

In Stepashin's place he {{appointed}} Vladimir Putin, relatively unknown at that time, and announced his wish to see Putin as his successor. In late 1999 Yeltsin and President Clinton openly disagreed {{on the war in}} Chechnya. At the November meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Clinton pointed his <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Yeltsin and demanded he halt bombing attacks that had resulted in many civilian casualties. Yeltsin immediately left the conference.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} achieve this effect, a seam bowler usually {{delivers}} the ball with the seam held upright, with rotation about a horizontal axis. This keeps the seam aligned vertically as it travels towards the batsman, making it likely that the ball will bounce with the seam on the pitch. Of course, consistently hitting the seam is {{not as easy as}} it sounds. The seam has to be held upright between the index finger and the middle <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the time of the delivery of the ball and, most importantly, the wrist has to be dead straight when the ball is delivered. The seam and wrist position of Australia's Glenn McGrath are arguably a perfect example.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2007–08 NBA season, the Lakers faced two key {{injuries}} in the offseason. Andrew Bynum, who missed {{the second half of}} the season and playoffs was rehabilitating and working on conditioning. Trevor Ariza, who also missed {{the second half of the}} season, but later returned in the playoffs also had to work back into shape. Both players played on opening day. During the 2007–08 season, Kobe Bryant suffered a tear in his right pinkie <b>finger.</b> <b>At</b> the time, Bryant decided to forgo surgery and play out the rest of the season and participate in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He eventually chose to not to have surgery and let the hand heal naturally.|$|E

25|$|The show also covered {{many social}} issue storylines, {{including}} sexual assault, mental illness, and alcoholism. When Lorna was raped {{after a night}} of heavy drinking, viewers watched as she dealt with the aftermath of her brutal attack. She originally pointed the <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Morgan Winthrop (Grayson McCouch), but her rapist turned out to be Kyle Barkley (Roger Floyd). Cass and Frankie were devastated when their daughter, Charlie (Lindsay Fabes), became ill. Luckily, she recovered, but Cass had begun acting strangely. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which had been triggered by Charlie's illness. Again, viewers were informed: they learned both the symptoms of the illness and how to treat it by watching Cass see a counselor and start to take medication. Felicia had begun drinking heavily after Lucas's death, but she refused to call herself an alcoholic. After her friends staged an intervention, she found help through Alcoholics Anonymous.|$|E
25|$|Kargil War: R {{was heavily}} criticised in 1999, {{following}} the Pakistani incursions at Kargil. Critics accused R {{of failing to}} provide intelligence that could have prevented the ensuing ten-week conflict that brought India and Pakistan {{to the brink of}} a full-scale war. While the Army has been critical of the information they received R has pointed the <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the politicians, claiming they had provided all the necessary information. However, R was successful in intercepting a telephonic conversation between Pervez Musharraf, the then Pakistan Army Chief who was in Beijing and his chief of staff Lt. Gen. Mohammed Aziz in Islamabad. This tape was later published by India to prove Pakistani involvement in the Kargil incursion. In 2011, a think tank report stated that RAW had warned in its October 1998 assessment that Pakistan Army might launch a limited swift offensive with possible support of alliance partners, however the government ignored such reports.|$|E
25|$|David Harland, {{the former}} head of UN Civil Affairs in Bosnia, claimed at the trial of General Dragomir Milošević in ICTY, that he was {{responsible}} for the creation of the myth that UNPROFOR was unable to determine who had fired the mortar shells that caused the second Markale massacre. The myth that has survived for more than ten years, Harland said, was created because of a “neutral statement” made by General Rupert Smith, the UNPROFOR commander. On the day of the second Markale attack, General Smith stated “it is unclear who fired the shells, although at that time he already had the technical report of UNPROFOR intelligence section, determining beyond reasonable doubt that they were fired from VRS positions at Lukavica”. Harland himself had advised General Smith to make “a neutral statement in order not to alarm the Serbs who would be alerted to the impending NATO air strikes against their positions had he pointed a <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> them”, which would have jeopardized the safety of UN troops in the territory under VRS control or on positions where they might have been vulnerable to retaliatory attacks by Serb forces.|$|E

25|$|Grand Master Oogway, an old {{tortoise}} and Shifu's mentor, has {{a vision}} that Shifu's former student, the evil snow leopard Tai Lung, will escape from prison {{and return to the}} Valley of Peace to take revenge for being denied the Dragon Scroll, which is said to hold the secret to limitless power. Shifu is alarmed and sends his messenger, the goose Zeng, with a request for the prison to heighten security in order to prevent Tai Lung's escape. He then holds a kung fu tournament for the Furious Five so that Oogway may identify the Dragon Warrior, the one kung fu master worthy of receiving the Dragon Scroll and capable of defeating Tai Lung. Forced to take a cumbersome noodle cart to the tournament, Po arrives as the arena doors close and is unable to enter. Desperate to see the Dragon Warrior chosen, Po straps himself to a set of fireworks, rockets into the sky, and crashes {{into the middle of the}} arena and opens his eyes to see Oogway pointing his <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> him. To the shock of everyone present, Oogway proclaims Po as the Dragon Warrior.|$|E
25|$|England {{obviously}} {{needed to}} do something to maintain their hold on the Ashes and three changes were made to the team. The first was forced as Godfrey Evans had broken his middle finger and the reserve wicket-keeper Roy Swetman made his Test debut. This was not so much of a loss as first thought, Evans had not batted well for some years and Swetman had impressed behind the stumps throughout the tour and his batting had improved beyond all hopes. Peter Richardson had failed repeatedly as an opening batsman in the Tests and was replaced by his old opening partner Arthur Milton, even though he had broken his <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Christmas. Willie Watson was dropped in favour of the newly arrived Cambridge and Sussex batsman Ted Dexter, who was also a more than useful swing bowler. May also had his final trump card, the fast bowler Fred Trueman, who had been ill at Brisbane and left out at Melbourne. He is widely considered to be England's greatest fast bowler and with good reason; he was the first man to take 300 wickets in Tests—307 at (21.57)—had tremendous stamina and bowled with a near perfect side on action that produced late swing at high pace. He was full of confidence and believed that he could get any batsman out on any wicket. Australia made changes as well, dropping Lindsay Kline who had taken 0/77 in two Tests and Bobby Simpson who had made a duck but was retained as twelfth man for his fielding. Instead they brought in the dual purpose fast-medium seamer and off-spinner Keith Slater, who had been twelfth man in the Second Test, but who had been accused of throwing by the MCC and Keith Miller. Mel McInnes kept his place as umpire even though Peter May and Freddie Brown had pointedly asked if it was necessary for him to officiate in all the Tests.|$|E
