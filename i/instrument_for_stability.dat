5000|$|The <b>Instrument</b> <b>for</b> <b>Stability</b> (IfS, more {{commonly}} referred to as the Stability Instrument) is a financial and political instrument at the disposal of the European Union. It is prepared at strategic level by the EEAS and implemented by the Commission. The objective is three-fold: 1/ respond to urgent needs due to political instability or a major disaster; 2/ build the conditions for long term stability in particular by addressing some major risks and threats that prevent political security and economic development, such as terrorism, organized crime, illicit trafficking, chemical-biological-nuclear risks but also new challenges such as pandemics, cybercrime, climate change or the protection of critical infrastructure; 3/ participate to the crisis management cycle by supporting CSDP operations and by contributing to restore stability after the crisis or the conflict. The <b>Instrument</b> <b>for</b> <b>Stability</b> was proposed by the Commission in September 2004 and created by the Council and Parliament on 15 November 2006 through Regulation No 1717/2006. It replaces the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM), which was considered unwieldy as it could only finance projects of up to six months. [...] In 2011 negotiations began for the next EU Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014-2020 including the legal basis for the <b>Instrument</b> <b>for</b> <b>Stability</b> for the period. The independent foundation the European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM) suggested that while the IfS was a useful instrument for conflict prevention and peacebuilding that it was not appropriate for it to be the only EU financial instrument that should include them as a key consideration for the period 2014 - 2020.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{significance}} of Islamic Sukuk <b>instruments</b> <b>for</b> <b>stability</b> in the GCC. As {{a result of the}} financial crisis of 2007 - 2008, interest in financial stability has increased. Islamic scholars suggest that Islamic financial institutions and products have the potential to contribute in achieving a more stable economic environment. This paper analyses Sukuk, an Islamic financial instrument with both bond and equity traits; and how it can contribute to achieving a more sound and resilient economic environment in the GCC. Findings suggest that Sukuk do have the potential to effectively contribute to the GCC’s economic stability; as long as they adhere to the pure Islamic financial principles and avoid trying to be comparable to conventional bonds. Currently, however there appears a heavy reliance on shorter term issuances, along with the majority of issuances in the USD, a heavy reliance on real estate as both a means of financing an underlying collateral in Islamic securitization; elements which could be destabilising especially during destress. The originality of this paper lies in its empirical contribution, as it, for the first, time sets out systematically the characteristics of Sukuk issuance in the GCC region with respect to Sukuk maturity, issuance currency and sectoral distribution. It also assesses the various Sukuk structures and the underlying risks involved; as well as the impact of collateral in Islamic securitization...|$|R

40|$|This paper delves into damage {{stability}} legislation {{as it applies}} to passenger ships. The Concordia accident, like many others before it, has shaken the maritime profession once again with many questions being asked without being able to provide credible answers. Old ships have been designed to lower standards (it is common knowledge that new ships are safer than old ships, with the latter comprising the majority of the population), new standards are holistic and goal-based offering knowledge of the standard these ships are designed to, which is not true for old ships, emergency response is an altogether different science in modern ships and many others. Notwithstanding this state of affairs, there is another more fundamental weakness in the regulations <b>for</b> damage <b>stability,</b> perhaps at the heart of most problems with cruise ships safety, old and new. A critical review into {{damage stability}} legislation, {{as it applies to}} passenger ships, offers compelling evidence that cruise ship characteristics and behaviour have not been accounted for in the derivation of relevant damage stability rules. As a result, the regulatory <b>instruments</b> <b>for</b> damage <b>stability</b> currently in place do not provide the right measure of damage <b>stability</b> <b>for</b> cruise ships and, even more worryingly, the right guidance for design improvement. This leads to a precarious situation where cruise ships are underrated when it comes to assigning a damage stability standard whilst depriving designers of appropriate legislative instruments to nurture continuous improvement. Documented evidence is being presented and the ensuing results and impact discussed. Recommendations are given for a way forward...|$|R

The model provides a partial explanation of the channels through which fiscal and monetary policy affects the real exchange rate. An empirical investigation is conducted for the case of Argentina during the currency board period of 1991 - 2001. Empirical estimates show that fiscal policy may indeed be an efficient <b>instrument</b> <b>for</b> promoting macroeconomic <b>stability</b> insofar as it encourages convergence toward long-run equilibrium and alters the long-term balance between exports and consumption, both private and public. The simulation applied to Argentina shows that if the share of public spending in the economy {{is higher than the}} share of imports, an increase in the tax rate will stimulate capital stock slightly, {{at least in the short}} term, anddepreciate the real effective exchange rate.

40|$|Over 90 % of the {{external}} relations budget of the EU is processed through its external financial instruments. With the Lisbon Treaty {{and the creation of}} the new European External Action Service (EEAS), the institutional architecture of these instruments was significantly reformed. This contribution analyses strategic programming both pre- and post-Lisbon, identifies ‘winners ’ and ‘losers’, and examines the potential of the new provisions to increase the coherence of EU external action. The examination shows that the instruments can be categorised into three groupings: ‘the big three ’ comprising the bulk of funding characterised by joint programming and responsibilities; the ‘Commission-only ’ instruments where all powers remain with the Commission; and the ‘EEAS-led rest ’ in which the High Representative and the EEAS play a strong role but only have limited financial resources available.

Within the current EU legislative framework, LRRD is broadly considered in the Humanitarian Aid Instrument, whereas the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) {{is characterized by a}} less systematic commitment to LRRD. The <b>Instrument</b> <b>for</b> <b>Stability</b> was designed as a more flexible instrument that also opens up opportunities for LRRD but it is mainly security driven and has failed to convince practitioners of its LRRD value. The analysis of the actual implementation of the European LRRD concept in different partner countries and crisis situations shows that, despite some progress made in recent years, the funding gap in the grey area between relief and development still exists and the coordination and enhancement of LRRD activities is far from being institutionalised. In the light of the 2014 - 2020 MFF and the new DCI, the study gives suggestions regarding the legal basis, financing options and general recommendations for the EU’s strategic framework on LRRD. Amongst others, additional resources are needed for LRRD, which should be seen as an approach rather than an option in geographical instruments and respective provisions should be made explicit in Country Strategy Papers...|$|E
40|$|Since 9 / 11, {{the role}} of the European Union (EU) in {{counter-terrorism}} has expanded rapidly. Most of the developments were internally derived and would affect only EU Member States and countries on the EU’s periphery. However, over the past few years, the EU has become increasingly involved in counter-terrorism outside its borders. Although it {{still has a long way}} to progress before being recognised as a counter-terrorism actor of note, the EU has demonstrated a commitment to include counter-terrorism related initiatives into its foreign policies. Analyses of the EU’s foreign policy counter-terrorism have focused on narrow definitions of foreign policy. It is necessary to distinguish between the external dimension of counter-terrorism and foreign policy counter-terrorism, and there is a need to combine these in order to better understand the EU as a counter-terrorism actor. Foreign policy and counter-terrorism therefore need to be broadly defined in order to take account of the full array of EU counter-terrorism initiatives. Through the EU’s efforts to counter terrorist financing, the EU’s role in Afghanistan, the EU-US relationship, and the Commission-based <b>Instrument</b> <b>for</b> <b>Stability</b> (IfS) it will be shown that the EU has made considerable progress towards creating a multi-faceted counter-terrorism policy in the nine years since 9 / 11...|$|E

Effectiveness and functional orientation of a banking system provide continuous and targeted financial resources flowing between different sectors of economy and this allows to perform economic activities of various entities. Thus, a banking system plays an essential role in the formation of market relations. A question of stable functioning of a banking system can be defined as a key one. The basic task is to improve the management of a banking system by achieving its stability. The disclosure of formalized description of the definition of tools to influence the selection procedure <b>for</b> ensuring <b>stability</b> of a banking system should be determined as the primary objective. For reaching the goal a comparative study has been introduced and generalized concerning the concept definition of «banking system» and the ideology of its management according to the circumstances and factors of influence. The combination of individual components is to determine the instruments of influence on the banking system activity in the form of chain ties. On the base of the analysis carried out the article grounds the necessity of the generalized use of formalized description of the procedures <b>for</b> selecting <b>instruments</b> <b>for</b> ensuring <b>stability</b> of a banking system.

This study examined the evidence for the validity of MSF <b>instruments</b> <b>for</b> general practice, investigated chan-ges in performance for doctors who participated twice, 5 years apart, and determined the association between change in performance and initial assess-ment and socio-demographic characteristics. METHODS Data for 250 doctors included three data-sets per doctor from, respectively, 25 patients, eight co-workers and eight medical colleagues, collected on two occasions. RESULTS There was high internal consistency (a> 0. 90) and adequate generalisability (Ep 2 > 0. 70). D study results indicate adequate generalisability coefficients for groups of eight asses-sors (medical colleagues, co-workers) and 25 patient surveys. Confirmatory factor analyses provided evi-dence for the validity of factors that were theoretically expected, meaningful and cohesive. Comparative fit indices were 0. 91 for medical colleague data, 0. 87 for co-worker data and 0. 81 for patient data. Paired t-test analysis showed significant change between the two assessments from medical colleagues and co-workers, but not between the two patient surveys.
