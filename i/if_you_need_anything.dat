40|$|During {{one of his}} {{recorded}} {{shows the}} American comedian Demetri Martin told the following joke, much to the amusement of his audience: She was amazing. I never met a woman like this before. She showed me to the dressing room. She said: “If you need anything, I’m Jill. ” I was like: “Oh, my God! I never met a woman before with a conditional identity. ” [Laughter] “What if I don’t need anything? Who are you? ” — “If you don’t need anything, I’m Eugene. ” [More laughter] (Demetri Martin, These are jokes) Martin’s joke is possible because of a peculiarity of certain conditional sentences. Some conditional sentences relate propositions that have no conditional relationship. This {{is by no means}} contradictory or paradoxical. The sentence (1) <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything,</b> I’m Jill. links the clauses “you need anything ” and “I’m Jill ” in a conditional construction, but semantically we may naturally perceive the propositions expressed by these clauses as conditionally unrelated; the name of the woman does not depend on whether the addressee needs anything or not. To humorously misapprehend such conditional sentences, as Martin does, is to pretend to see a conditional relationship where none exists. Examples that would lend themselves to similar joking have been discussed as a special case of conditionals from a variety of angles under a variety of names. I will speak of Biscuit Conditionals (BCs), a term which is derived from Austin’s famous example (2) (Austin 1956). (2) There are biscuits on the sideboard if you want them. It is widely assumed that BCs differ from standard conditionals (SCs) like (3) in that “the if-clauses in [BCs] specify the circumstances in which the consequent is relevant (in a vague sense, also subsuming circumstances of social appropriateness), not the circumstances in which it is true ” (Iatridou 1991, p. 51).

Review of the 12 th ENYSSP conference held in Warsaw, Poland. By Malgorzata Slawinska (Research department at ENYSSP; Head of organising committee). The 12 th ENYSSP conference “Professional development: Where can you take sport and exercise psychology?” was held at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities (SWPS) in Warsaw, Poland (21 – 22 November 2016). The European Network of Young Specialists in Sport Psychology was born in 2003, on the occasion of the 11 th European Congress of Sport Psychology held in Copenhagen, Denmark. The aims of ENYSSP are to provide and facilitate support in education, research, professional practice and service delivery to young people with official qualification or an interest in the field of Sport and Exercise Psychology. During the 12 th ENYSSP conference, three world class sport psychologists delivered a keynote lecture. Prof. Martin Hagger spoke about changing physical activity behaviour, Prof. Maurizo Bertollo discussed the multimodal psychological approach and Prof. Jan Blecharz shared his experience as a researcher and an applied practitioner in mental preparation for major sport competitions. The 12 th ENYSSP conference offered 13 applied workshops conducted in 4 parallel sessions, an oral presentation session and a poster session, which provided an excellent opportunity for learning and further development. The topics ranged from ACT approach to sport psychology consultancy, sport injury, motivational context, relaxation techniques and decision-making to Kinesiotrapping. For the full list of topics please visit [URL] There was a total of three scientific prizes awarded to best workshop, best poster presentation, and best oral communication. The prizes sponsored by Human Kinetics, Routledge and Palgrave publishers. Congratulations to all the prize winners from conference. The conference saw an excellent number of attendance; 28 nations were represented including most European countries as well as Canada, Taiwan, Russia, UAE, Thailand, Armenia, India and Australia. ENYSSP would like to thank their partners, SWPS, Human Kinetics, Routledge and Palgrave publishers, Polish Olympic committee (PKOL), Polish psychological association (PTP) and Warsaw tourism organisation. Stay tuned for more information on the next ENYSSP workshop 2017 to be held in Bratislava! 3. FEPSAC internship report. By Nathalie Novembrini (Italy). Few months ago a friend suggested me to look on the FEPSAC website to see if there were interesting internship opportunities. He is currently doing a PhD and knew I was considering to follow his path; it would have been a good chance to collect more elements before making a final decision on my future career. Based on both my interests and my friend's suggestions, I finally opted for a sport psychology internship at the University of Copenhagen. I thought it was a great opportunity to become more familiar with quantitative methods and to have a general idea of what doing research is. Honestly, one of the reasons why I chose Copenhagen is that I have always dreamed of visiting Scandinavian countries and this internship allows me to do it while carrying out research in sport psychology. It sounded perfect to me! I contacted the professor in charge of the internship, Dr. Anne-Marie Elbe, who kindly explained to me how it worked and entrusted me to my supervisor, Dr. Johan Michael Wikman, with whom I discussed in more detail the projects I would be working on. I was also lucky enough to find accommodation at a local family, which gave me a taste of Danish everyday life. Coming from Italy, I must say the first impact with Danish habits was quite bewildering, but after a few days I got used to different rhythms of life and everything went well. Something that was of great help was the fact that everyone in Denmark speaks English. It is really encouraging to know that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything</b> you can easily make yourself understood. As for the internship, I carried out different activities: Literature review, hypothesis creation, data clearing and analysis with SPSS. Studying statistics turned out to be more stimulating than I had thought and I was amazed at how my supervisor took into account my interests before giving me any task. Moreover, he was always available to provide me, patiently, with feedback when needed. The FEPSAC internship was a really exciting experience, both from an academic and a personal point of view. On the one hand, it gave me the chance to make up my mind whether to apply for a PhD or not, and to come into contact with well-known professors from different academic fields. On the other hand, I had the opportunity to experience a completely different way of life and meet wonderful people. 4.

The Bravery’s last show of the day was the first of three sold out headlining shows at the Astoria. On June 14, 2005, The Bravery supported the opening night of U2’s European tour in Manchester, UK. During The Bravery’s opening song [...] "Rites of Spring", the power failed on stage. The band left the stage coming back 10 minutes later, only to have the power shut off again. Bono {{wrote a letter to the}} band thanking them, stating [...] "P.S. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>need</b> <b>anything,</b> call Edge, Adam or Larry". The Bravery went on to support other European dates for U2 including a sold out 90,000 capacity Croke Park concert in Dublin on June 27. The Bravery played at Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2005. Their set was due to be aired live on BBC Three in the daytime, but had to be shown well after the watershed, as bass guitarist Mike Hindert stripped naked on stage due to the hot weather and threw himself into the drumkit to end their set. A photograph of Hindert’s buttocks on stage with 40,000 people in the distance was featured in the following issue of the NME and Blender Magazine, where Mike was quoted as saying [...] "A bottle of Jager will usually do that to you. It wasn't the best showing of my life. I should get a girl to fluff me beforehand". His nakedness is now immortalized on film in Julien Temple’s Glastonbury The Film. Throughout 2005, The Bravery sold out headlining shows all over the world and played some of the largest festivals including SXSW, Coachella Music Festival, Glastonbury and Lollapalooza. In November and December 2005 and January through March 2006, the band was the supporting act for Depeche Mode on their Touring the Angel world tour. The tour traveled all over the US, UK and Europe.|$|R
