5|$|Cardcaptor Sakura {{began as}} a manga series written and {{illustrated}} by the manga artist group Clamp. It was serialized in the monthly shōjo (aimed at young girls) manga magazine Nakayoshi from the May 1996 to June 2000 issue. The individual chapters were collected and published in 12 tankōbon volumes by Kodansha from November 1996 to July 2000. Kodansha released the first six volumes in bilingual editions that included both Japanese and English from May 2000 to July 2001. The bilingual volumes were part of an <b>experimental</b> <b>line</b> for helping Japanese children learn English. Kodansha stopped releasing the bilingual editions after the series was licensed in English for distribution in North America by Tokyopop.|$|E
25|$|Wheatstone {{abandoned}} {{his idea of}} transmitting intelligence by the mechanical vibration of rods, and took up the electric telegraph. In 1835 he lectured on the system of Baron Schilling, and declared that the means were already known by which an electric telegraph could be made of great service to the world. He made experiments with a plan of his own, and not only proposed to lay an <b>experimental</b> <b>line</b> across the Thames, but to establish it on the London and Birmingham Railway. Before these plans were carried out, however, he received a visit from Mr William Fothergill Cooke at his house in Conduit Street on 27 February 1837, which had an important influence on his future.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} {{work had been}} {{proceeding}} on the experimental lines as well. The first leg of the East Indian Railway line, a broad gauge railway, from Howrah to Pandua, was opened in 1854 (see picture of locomotive below), and the entire line up to Raniganj would become functional {{by the time of}} the Indian rebellion of 1857. The Great Indian Peninsular Railway was permitted to extend its <b>experimental</b> <b>line</b> to Poona. This extension required planning for the steep rise in the Bor Ghat valley in the Western Ghats, a section 15¾ miles long with an ascent of 1,831 feet. Construction began in 1856 and was completed in 1863, and, in the end, the line required a total of twenty five tunnels and fifteen miles of gradients (inclines) of 1 in 50 or steeper, the most extreme being the Bor Ghat Incline, a distance of 1¾ miles at a gradient of 1 in 37 (see picture above).|$|E
40|$|An {{appropriate}} tester correctly {{identifies the}} relative performance of <b>experimental</b> <b>lines</b> while maximizing {{the differences between}} lines. Most sorghum breeding programs use elite inbred lines testers. Inbred <b>line</b> testers evaluate <b>experimental</b> <b>lines</b> against a specific genetic background, possibly increasing the probability of incorrectly discarding material. A potential solution would be to use F 1 testers that combine two genetic backgrounds. The purpose {{of this research was}} to compare F 1 testers versus inbred line testers for evaluating <b>experimental</b> sorghum <b>lines</b> in testcrosses Line x tester analyses were performed to assess tester consistency in assigning ranks. With one exception, all of the line x tester analyses were non-significant, indicating that the testers provided similar evaluations of the <b>experimental</b> <b>lines.</b> Correlations between the ranking of the <b>experimental</b> <b>lines</b> by their average performance and the rank assignments of each tester were measured to further asses tester accuracy. In all cases, the rank correlations were highly significant, implying that all of the testers accurately ranked <b>experimental</b> <b>lines.</b> In addition, all of the testers consistently identified the majority of the top performing <b>experimental</b> <b>lines</b> despite some important rank shifts. F-ratios for variance among the <b>experimental</b> <b>lines</b> (entry effect) were compared with the Schumann-Bradley statistical test to compare efficiencies. With one exception, the F 1 testers always produced the largest or second largest entry effect F-ratio. Where the F 1 testers produced the second largest F-ratio, it was not declared statistically different from the largest F-ratio by the Schumann-Bradley test, indicating that the testers had similar discriminatory efficiencies. Testcross variances were measured to further compare discriminatory efficiencies. With one exception, the F 1 testers consistently produced the largest variances, evidence that the F 1 testers were effective in maximizing differences among the <b>experimental</b> <b>lines.</b> The results indicate that F 1 testers represent valid testers for evaluating <b>experimental</b> sorghum <b>lines</b> against two genetic backgrounds in a single testcross...|$|R

500|$|The committee's {{preferred}} {{system was}} a 3,000volt, three-phase alternating current system proposed by Hungarian electrical engineering company Ganz. The system delivered current by overhead conductor wires and was cheaper than alternatives using power rails and required fewer electrical sub-stations. An <b>experimental</b> <b>line</b> had been constructed by Ganz in Budapest, although the system {{had not yet}} been adopted for the full-scale operation of a railway. Before the appointment of Ganz could be finalised, Yerkes took control of the DR. He and his engineers preferred the low voltage direct current conductor rail system they had worked with in the United States and were intending to use on the tube lines when they were constructed; they rejected the Ganz system putting the DR and the MDETC into dispute with the MR which wanted to proceed with the Ganz system. [...] After some acrimonious debate between the two companies, some of which was carried out in public through the letters pages of The Times newspaper, the dispute went to arbitration at the Board of Trade. The decision was made in December 1901 to use the four-rail system, although the arbitrator, Alfred Lyttelton, was critical of the DR's unilateral decision.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>experimental</b> <b>line,</b> with a sixth return wire, was run {{between the}} Euston {{terminus}} and Camden Town station of the London and North Western Railway on 25 July 1837. The actual distance {{was only one}} and a half-mile (2.4km), but spare wire had been inserted in the circuit to increase its length. It {{was late in the}} evening before the trial took place. Mr Cooke was in charge at Camden Town, while Mr Robert Stephenson and other gentlemen looked on; and Wheatstone sat at his instrument in a dingy little room, lit by a tallow candle, near the booking-office at Euston. Wheatstone sent the first message, to which Cooke replied, and 'never' said Wheatstone, 'did I feel such a tumultuous sensation before, as when, all alone in the still room, I heard the needles click, and as I spelled the words, I felt all the magnitude of the invention pronounced to be practicable beyond cavil or dispute.' ...|$|E

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to characterize soybean <b>experimental</b> <b>lines</b> for Asian soybean rust reaction. In the 2004 / 2005 growing season, three experiments were conducted with middle-cycle and three with late-cycle genotypes, designed in randomized blocks with four replications. Twelve <b>experimental</b> <b>lines</b> and two cultivars of each cycle were used. In each experiment the plant management differs as follows: three applications of carbendazim or three of flutriafol or without applications. The <b>experimental</b> <b>lines</b> with high yield, low notes to the symptoms and resistance to lodging, were selected and tested again in the 2005 / 2006 growing season. Genotypes with high severity and yield were considered tolerant to rust and the low severity and high yield ones as moderately resistant. Among the medium-cycle genotypes, there was moderate resistance to rust in one line and tolerance in five. Among the late-cycle genotypes, the six lines showed moderate resistance. The line USP 97 - 08135 is more tolerant to rust...|$|R

40|$|Low {{temperature}} {{is the most}} important abiotic stress affecting rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield in Chile. Rice in Chile is usually planted when the minimum air temperatures are below 12 °C. This {{temperature is}} lower than the optimum needed for normal rice germination. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate cold tolerance in 20 <b>experimental</b> <b>lines</b> from the Rice Breeding Program of the Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias (INIA), Chile, at the germination stage. Coleoptile length reduction (CRED), coleoptile length after cold treatment (CLEN), coleoptile length recovery (CREC), and coleoptile regrowth (CREG) were evaluated at 13 °C for 4 d using 'Diamante-INIA' as the cold-tolerant control. To find genotypes with cold tolerance (low CRED value and high CLEN, CREC, and CREG values), genotypes were ranked, a biplot of principal components, and cluster analysis were performed. No differences were found among genotypes in the ranking based on CREC value so this trait was not considered. Analysis showed that only three <b>experimental</b> <b>lines</b> had cold tolerance similar to that of 'Diamante-INIA'; all other <b>experimental</b> <b>lines</b> exhibited intermediate to low cold tolerance. These results showed low cold tolerance of some Chilean genotypes at the germination stage, thus confirming the need to evaluate the rest of the germplasm from the Rice Breeding Program...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to analyse genetically natural beds and {{cultures}} of the most commercially important mollusc of Santa Catarina (South Brazil), the brown mussel Perna perna. Two sites were chosen for sampling from natural beds and for settling <b>experimental</b> <b>lines</b> with seeds obtained from each local farm. <b>Experimental</b> <b>lines</b> were maintained during four months for evaluating the growth of mussels from different cultures. DNA was extracted by Chelex-Proteinase-k method from adductor muscle and amplified by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using PMS 1 microsatellite primers. Denatured 6 % polyacrylamide gel and silver staining were used for separation and visualisation of PCR products, respectively. The nuclear locus obtained showed {{no significant differences in}} allele frequencies between natural stocks. Cultured mussels in Penha did not differ genetically from natural beds, but Canto Grande culture was significantly different from the local stock. Mean sizes reached in <b>experimental</b> <b>lines</b> and also from individuals collected in natural stocks were found to be higher in Canto Grande than in Penha. Canto Grande samples showed departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the studied locus, due to heterozygote deficiency. The genetic distinction of Canto Grande cultured mussels suggests that seeds from other localities may have been used occasionally by fishermen to set lines for culture...|$|R
