5000|$|The {{entry of}} the pit lane, which begins at the {{penultimate}} corner of the 23-turn layout, was deemed to be [...] "difficult and incredibly dangerous" [...] by several drivers due to the fast nature of the corners where they were situated. The problem was deemed to be primarily due to the speed differential of those entering the pits and those continuing on another lap and their sharing of the same race line. The controversial pit entry at Singapore was then modified ahead of Saturday's official Qualifying round by extending the pit <b>entry</b> <b>line</b> away from the pits. This change compelled drivers to commit to the pit entry earlier, providing additional warning to those following behind.In March 2009, three of the circuit's corners were given names after a competition amongst local F1 fans to submit ideas. Turn 1 was named Sheares after Benjamin Henry Sheares, the second president of Singapore; Turn 7 was named Memorial due to its proximity to a Second World War civilian memorial; and Turn 10 was named Singapore Sling. The Singapore Sling was changed for the 2013 Grand Prix and Turn 10 is now a flowing left-hander.|$|E
50|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, {{and a third}} on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90 minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The very first practice session on the newly opened Valencia Street Circuit was held on a dusty and slippery track, but despite the drivers' relative unfamiliarity with the circuit there were no major incidents (though David Coulthard did hit the barriers late in the session). Sébastien Bourdais went fastest early on, {{but it was his}} Toro Rosso teammate Sebastian Vettel who posted the quickest time of the session. Massa and Hamilton finished second and third, with Bourdais just behind them. Following the session, the drivers and personnel observed a minute's silence for those killed in the plane crash in Madrid two days previously. Kimi Räikkönen topped the timesheets in second practice, having traded fastest times with teammate Massa {{for the majority of the}} session. Fernando Alonso had the set the quickest time late, but was surpassed by Räikkönen in his final flying lap. A notable incident in the session involved Nico Rosberg spinning under brakes in the final corners, and narrowly missing Mark Webber on the inside, before rejoining the track with no damage done. Surprsingly, usual back-runner Jenson Button, driving for Honda, finished third. After the session, Fernando Alonso, driving for Renault, was reprimanded and fined €10,000, after crossing the pitlane <b>entry</b> <b>line</b> early on in the second session. Rain overnight meant that the Valencia track began with almost no rubber on the surface, but Robert Kubica was still able to carry enough speed to become the first man of the weekend to break into the 1:38s, with Rosberg and Bourdais close behind. There were minimal mishaps, with only Hamilton and Timo Glock spinning. Jarno Trulli spent the majority of the session in the pits with gearbox problems, completing only two laps.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, {{it has become}} clear that the immune system plays a {{critical}} role in animal behavior. This role is tightly linked to the obvious role that immune cell activation plays in the clearance of pathogenic organisms. Systemic or central infections elicit a group of symptoms that are necessary for the organism to conserve resources, reorganize priorities and limit the spread of the infection to other members of the community. This sickness behavior is a motivational state that is common to most pathogen-induced infections ranging from viruses to multicellular parasites, but, because of its ubiquitous nature, is frequently accepted as an unavoidable and non-specific consequence of infection. However, considering the broad spectrum of symptoms – fever, nausea, decreased appetite, malaise, fatigue and achiness – it seems clear that a highly organized, although not pathogen-specific, response is being manifested to aid in the fight against infection (Dantzer, 2001; Ericsson et al., 1995). We are all familiar with the human symptoms of sickness but, to investigate changes in behavior associated with sickness, it is critical to have reliable animal measurements that relate to changes in the affective state. Using preclinical animal models, sickness behavior is best evaluated when the test involves a means to assess motivation. Sickness behavior is frequently assessed as social exploration/investigation (in rodent models, this response is frequently reported as a decrease in time actively seeking interaction with a novel animal as a result of diminished motivation for social exploration or neophobia). Social exploration is a naturalistic behavior and all animals have a strong motivation, whether driven by curiosity or sexual desire. With this strong motivational stimulus, infections cause a strong differential between time of exploration of healthy and sick animals, with less time of exploration being observed with sick animals. Another simpler but effective model is exploration of the environment [often referred to as locomotor activity (LMA), representing some level of physical movement in a novel environment such as rearing, quadrant <b>entry,</b> <b>line</b> crossings or total distance traveled; all of which are highly correlated]. LMA is best conducted in a novel environment, as the motivation to explore is stronger in thi...|$|E

40|$|Data Envelopment Analysis DEA is {{a method}} for {{estimating}} (in-) efficiencies of Decision Making Units DMUs by means of weighted output - to input - ratios, being the weights optimal virtual prices of such ex-post activities for all units.
