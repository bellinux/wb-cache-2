40|$|Aims. The {{hydrogen}} Lyman lines {{provide important}} diagnostic {{information about the}} dynamics of the chromosphere, but there have been few systematic studies of their variability during flares. We investigate Doppler shifts in these lines in several flares, and use these to calculate plasma speeds. Methods. We use spectral data from the Multiple EUV Grating Spectrograph B (MEGS-B) detector of the Extreme-Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory. MEGS-B obtains full-disk spectra of the Sun at a resolution of 0. 1 nm in the range 37 – 105 nm, which we analyse using three independent methods. The first method performs Gaussian fits to the lines, and compares the quiet-Sun centroids with the flaring ones to obtain the Doppler shifts. The second method uses cross-correlation to detect wavelength shifts between the quiet-Sun and <b>flaring</b> <b>line</b> profiles. The final method calculates the “center-of-mass” of the line profile, and compares the quiet-Sun and flaring centroids to obtain the shift. Results. In a study of 6 flares we find strong signatures of both upflow and downflow in the Lyman lines, with speeds measured in Sun-as-a-Star data of around 10 km[*]s- 1, and speeds in the flare excess signal of around 30 km[*]s- 1. Conclusions. All events showing upflows in Lyman lines are associated with some kind of eruption or coronal flow in imaging data, which may be responsible for the net blueshifts. Events showing downflows in the Lyman lines may be associated with loop contraction or faint downflows, but it is likely that chromospheric condensation flows are also contributing...|$|E

Potassium is of importance in the continuing debate concerning the nature of the coronal/photospheric element abundance ratios which are widely considered to depend on first ionization potential since it has the lowest FIP of any common element in the Sun. The measurements were obtained with the RESIK crystal spectrometer on the Coronas-F spacecraft. A differential emission measure DEM = const. x exp (-(beta) T(sub e) was found to be the most consistent with the data out of three models considered. We find that the coronal ratio [K/H] = 3. 7 x 10 (exp - 7), a factor 3 times photospheric, in agreement with other observations using line-to-line ratios. Our measured value for the coronal ratio [Ar/H] = 1. 5 x 10 (exp - 6) is significantly less than photospheric, indicating that there is a slight depletion of this high-FIP element in the corona.

40|$|Abstract. A {{method of}} calculating NLTE models of a plan-parallel solar flare {{atmosphere}} with stationary plasma flows is presented. To solve the radiative trans-fer equation, equations of statistical equilibrium (ESE) and the stationary momentum equation, {{we use the}} mul-tilevel approximate lambda iteration (MALI) approach. The numerical code {{is based on the}} method recently de-veloped by Rybicky & Hummer (1991, 1992) and allows to take into account macroscopic velocity elds in observer’s frame formulation. The preconditioned ESE, constructed by this method, are nally linearized with respect to level populations and electron densities to treat the the hydro-gen ionization balance. The numerical code based on this method is used to compute a grid of NLTE flare models with various velocity elds in order to show the influence of the velocity elds on the H-line asymmetries. The analysis of the results lead to conclusions that would improve interpretations of <b>flare</b> <b>line</b> asymmetries: 1) The velocities aect the level populations, 2) The type of asymmetry depends on the changes in the optical depth scales and on the run of the source function in the atmo-sphere. 3) A monotonous velocity aects only one wing of the line prole. 4) To get the velocity eld from an observed prole the bisector method should be modied...|$|R

Flare and quiet intervals were identified from the broadband near-UV light curve, and {{the spectrum of}} each flare was separately extracted. Mg II and Fe II line profiles show similar behavior during the flares. Two large flares allowed time-resolved spectra to be analyzed, revealing a very broad component to the Mg II k line profile {{in at least one}} flare spectrum (F 9 b). If interpreted as a velocity, this component requires chromospheric material to be moving with FWHM ~ 250 km/sec, implying kinetic energy far in excess of the radiative energy. The Mg II k <b>flare</b> <b>line</b> profiles were compared to recent radiative hydrodynamic models of flare atmospheres undergoing electron beam heating.

Each of the ~ 38, 000 M dwarfs in the SDSS low mass star spectroscopic sample of West et al. was observed several times (usually 3 - 5) in exposures that were typically 9 - 25 minutes in duration. Our criteria allowed us to identify flares that exhibit very strong H-alpha and H-beta emission line strength and/or significant variability in those lines {{throughout the course of}} the exposures. The flares we identified have characteristics consistent with flares observed by classical spectroscopic monitoring. The flare duty cycle for the objects in our sample is found to increase from 0. 02 % for early M dwarfs to 3 % for late M dwarfs. We find that the flare duty cycle is larger in the population near the Galactic plane and that the flare stars are more spatially restricted than the magnetically active but non-flaring stars. This suggests that flare frequency may be related to stellar age (younger stars are more likely to flare) and that the flare stars are younger than the mean active population.
