5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another.

In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in <b>it</b> <b>are</b> in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark.
