They were square and squat, as destitute, most of them, of paint as they were of any attempt at adornment; and in hot weather the newer ones were permeated with a pungent, resinous smell.|$|E

50|$|As in most mines, the tailings, waste {{left over}} from {{processing}} ore, are a problem, although in Cyprus' case they were also a boon.

As the company did while it operated, now Cyprus also prefers to retain the past economic benefits of mining without spending funds on environmental remediation, particularly with neither the income from the mines nor the use of the now polluted land surrounding those mines, asserting that modern Cyprus has no way to pay for the cleanup.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} multiverses is {{mentioned}} {{many times in}} Hindu Puranic literature, {{such as in the}} Bhagavata Purana:Every universe is covered by seven layers — earth, water, fire, air, sky, the total energy and false ego — each ten times greater than the previous one. There are innumerable universes besides this one, and although they are unlimitedly large, they move about like atoms in You. Therefore You are called unlimited (Bhagavata Purana 6.16.37) Analogies to describe multiple universes also exist in the Puranic literature:Because You are unlimited, neither the lords of heaven nor even You Yourself can ever reach the end of Your glories. The countless universes, each enveloped in its shell, are compelled by the wheel of time to wander within You, like particles of <b>dust</b> <b>blowing</b> about in the sky.

Who can count the Indras in them all--those Indras side by side, who reign at once in all the innumerable worlds; those others who passed away before them; or even the Indras who succeed each other in any given line, ascending to godly kingship, one by one, and, one by one, passing away (Brahma Vaivarta Purana) ...|$|E

The distributions were measured under different dust conditions (background, floating <b>dust,</b> <b>blowing</b> dust, and dust storm) and statistical analyses were performed. The results showed that, under different dust conditions, the instantaneous number concentrations of dust particles differed widely. For example, during blowing sand and dust storm conditions, instantaneous dust particles concentrations varied substantially, while, under floating dust conditions, concentration differences were relatively small. The average dust particles size distributions were unimodal under all dust conditions, {{but the average}} surface area and mass size distributions were all bimodal. These distributions had peaks in different locations under different dust conditions. Under different dust conditions, wind speed and humidity were very important factors for particles size distributions. With increasing wind speed and decreasing humidity, fine particles were dominant in the atmosphere and the number and mass distributions of the coarse particles were indicative of long-range transport from surrounding deserts. Different dust conditions had different influences on PM 1, PM 2. 5, and PM 10 concentrations...|$|E

40|$|We report {{results of}} a field {{campaign}} conducted in the Nevada desert with a suite of electric field instruments consisting of a field mill (FM) and a short dipole antenna (SDA). Furthermore, we show {{that a combination of}} the measurements of these two instruments allows the estimation of the electric resistivity of air, an important quantity that is extremely difficult to measure near the Earth's surface. The electric resistivity of air is found to vary between 1. 5 [*]·[*] 10 13 and 6 [*]·[*] 10 13 Ω m and to correlate with changes in electric field. Vertical DC electric fields with amplitudes up to 6 [*]kV[*]m − 1 were observed to correspond to clouds of <b>dust</b> <b>blowing</b> through the measurement site. Enhanced DC and AC electric fields are measured during periods when horizontal wind speed exceeds 7 [*]m[*]s − 1, or around twice the background value. We suggest that low‐frequency emissions, below ~ 200 [*]Hz, are generated by the motion of electrically charged particles {{in the vicinity of the}} SDA electrode and propose a simple model to reproduce the observed spectra. According to this model, the spectral response is controlled by three parameters, (i) the speed of the charged particles, (ii) the charge concentration, and (iii) the minimum distance between the particle and the electrode. In order to explain the electric fields measured with the FM sensors at different heights, we developed a multilayer model that relates the electric field to the charge distribution. For example, a nonlinear variation of the electric field observed by the FM sensors below 50 [*]cm is simulated by a near‐surface layer of tens of centimeters that is filled with electrically charged particles that carry a predominantly negative charge in the vicinity of the soil.
