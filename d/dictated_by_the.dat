5|$|As <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{prescriptions}} Ubi periculum and Ne Romani, the conclave {{should have}} begun on 4 August, {{ten days after}} the death of Innocent VIII; however, the conclave was delayed to await the slow arrival of the aged Gherardo, bearing a letter from Venice's Council of Ten urging his acceptance into the College. The cardinals had decided as early as their first meeting on 24 July to use the Sistine Chapel for the balloting and assembly of the conclave.|$|E
5|$|Resistivity is {{a measure}} of how {{strongly}} a material opposes the flow of electric current. The resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal, and it gets even higher with lower temperatures, which is unusual for metals. This trend continues down to 100K, below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples. Resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20K due to radiation damage, with the rate <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> isotopic composition of the sample.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of the classical Nazarov cyclization reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by Shoppe to be an intramolecular electrocyclization and is outlined below. Activation of the ketone by the acid catalyst generates a pentadienyl cation, which undergoes a thermally allowed 4π conrotatory electrocyclization as <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Woodward-Hoffman rules. This generates an oxyallyl cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a β-hydrogen. Subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product.|$|E

5|$|Umbriel may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (317km) is about 54% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 40% of the moon’s mass—the parameters are <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Umbriel is about 0.24GPa (2.4kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Admittedly, Diocletian's praetorian prefects—Afranius Hannibalianus, Julius Asclepiodotus, and Aurelius Hermogenianus—aided in {{regulating}} the flow and presentation of such paperwork, but the deep legalism of Roman culture kept the workload heavy. Emperors in the forty years preceding Diocletian's reign had not managed these duties so effectively, and their output in attested rescripts is low. Diocletian, by contrast, was prodigious in his affairs: there are around 1,200 rescripts {{in his name}} still surviving, and these probably represent {{only a small portion}} of the total issue. The sharp increase in the number of edicts and rescripts produced under Diocletian's rule has been read as evidence of an ongoing effort to realign the whole Empire on terms <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> imperial center.|$|E

5|$|Dentin is a mineralized {{connective}} tissue with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border. The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 μm near the pulp, to 1.2 μm in the midportion, and 900nm near the dentino-enamel junction. Although {{they may have}} tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other. Their length is <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> radius of the tooth. The three dimensional configuration of the dentinal tubules is genetically determined.|$|E
5|$|Given its size, rock/ice {{composition}} {{and the possible}} presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water, Ariel's interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (372km) is about 64% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 56% of the moon's mass—the parameters are <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Ariel is about 0.3GPa (3kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Oberon may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (480km) is about 63% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 54% of the moon's mass—the proportions are <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Oberon is about 0.5GPa (5kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear. If the ice contains enough ammonia or other antifreeze, Oberon may possess a liquid ocean layer at the core–mantle boundary. The thickness of this ocean, if it exists, is up to 40km and its temperature is around 180K. However, the internal structure of Oberon depends heavily on its thermal history, which is poorly known at present.|$|E

5|$|Shooting for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari {{began at}} the end of December 1919 and {{concluded}} {{at the end of}} January 1920. It was shot entirely in a studio without any exterior shots, which was unusual for films of the time, but <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> decision to give the film an Expressionist visual style. The extent to which Mayer and Janowitz participated during filming is disputed: Janowitz claims the duo repeatedly refused to allow any script changes during production, and Pommer claimed Mayer was on the set for every day of filming. But Hermann Warm claimed they were never present for any of the shooting or involved in any discussions during production.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Alexander at Issus {{is painted}} on a limewood panel {{measuring}} , and portrays {{the moment of}} Alexander the Great's victory. The vertical format was <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William's set of eight was made {{to be the same}} size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the sky was originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene. The scene is approached from an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the curvature of the Earth itself.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Basque Roads, {{also known}} as the Battle of Aix Roads (French: Bataille de l'île d'Aix, also Affaire des brûlots, rarely Bataille de la rade des Basques) was a major naval battle of the Napoleonic Wars, fought in the narrow Basque Roads {{at the mouth of the}} Charente River on the Biscay coast of France. The battle, which lasted from 11–25 April 1809, was unusual in that it pitted a hastily-assembled {{squadron}} of small and unorthodox British Royal Navy warships against the main strength of the French Atlantic Fleet, the circumstances <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cramped, shallow coastal waters in which the battle was fought. The battle is also notorious for its controversial political aftermath in both Britain and France.|$|E

5|$|The destroyers Yukikaze and Asagumo plucked 950 {{survivors}} of Kyokusei Maru from the water. These two destroyers, being {{faster than the}} convoy since its speed was <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> slower transports, {{broke away from the}} group to disembark the survivors at Lae. The destroyers resumed their escort duties the next day. The convoy – without the troop transport and two destroyers – was attacked again on the evening of 2 March by 11 B-17s, with minor damage to one transport. During the night, PBY Catalina flying boats from No. 11 Squadron RAAF took over the task of shadowing the convoy.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with more}} serious {{injuries}} {{had to be}} carried down the track. The usual {{decision as to whether}} it was safe to move someone was simplified by the Japanese, who killed all the wounded they encountered. Only those near death were abandoned. Casualties were held at the aid posts and dressing stations until they could walk, or the Japanese threatened. It took eight or ten Papuan carriers to move each man. Army stretchers rotted and fell apart; the Papuans improvised stretchers from blankets, copra bags and timber cut along the Track. The pace of the withdrawal was <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rate at which casualties could be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|To assist his endeavour, Shackleton {{adopted a}} mixed {{transport}} strategy, involving {{the use of}} Manchurian ponies as pack animals, {{as well as the}} more traditional dog-sledges. A specially adapted motor car was also taken. Although the dogs and the car were used during the expedition for a number of purposes, the task of assisting the group that would undertake the march to the pole fell to the ponies. The size of Shackleton's four-man polar party was <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> number of surviving ponies; of the ten that were embarked in New Zealand, only four had survived the 1908 winter.|$|E
