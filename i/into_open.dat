5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First Crusade, Crusader armies assembled at Constantinople and promised to return to the Byzantine Empire any land they might conquer. However, Bohemond, the son of Alexios' former enemy Robert Guiscard, claimed the Principality of Antioch for himself. Alexios did not recognize the legitimacy of the Principality, and Bohemond went to Europe looking for reinforcements. He launched <b>into</b> <b>open</b> warfare against Alexios, but he was soon forced to surrender and negotiate with Alexios at the imperial camp at Diabolis (Devol), where the Treaty was signed.|$|E

5|$|Brighton's origins {{lie in the}} Saxon {{fishing and}} {{agricultural}} village of Bristelmestune. The English Channel formed its southern limit, but on all other sides was farmland divided <b>into</b> <b>open</b> fields called laines. These were further subdivided into furlongs—wide parallel strips—and paul-pieces, which were much narrower strips. Despite their small size, neighbouring paul-pieces often had different owners. Wide paths (leakways) ran at right-angles to the furlongs, separating them. This ancient land-use pattern, which survived until the 18th century despite its unsuitability for contemporary farming methods, significantly influenced the pattern of urban development in 18th- and 19th-century Brighton.|$|E
5|$|Debate exists {{over the}} {{significance}} and {{outcome of the}} battle. The German forces destroyed many Soviet tanks and temporarily degraded the striking power of the 5th Guards Tank Army, but {{they were unable to}} take Prokhorovka or break through <b>into</b> <b>open</b> ground before developments elsewhere forced the termination of Operation Citadel. For the Soviet side, the massive armoured attack of 12 July failed to destroy the II SS-Panzer Corps, but succeeded in exhausting the Germans and eventually contributed to checking their advance. Thus, neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS-Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives for 12 July.|$|E
5|$|Friction also persisted between France and Britain over Acadia's borders. The {{boundaries}} were unclear as {{laid out}} by the treaty, which even the French had never formally described. France insisted that only the Acadian peninsula {{was included in the}} treaty (modern Nova Scotia except Cape Breton Island) and that they retained the rights to modern New Brunswick. The disputes over Acadia flared <b>into</b> <b>open</b> conflict during King George's War in the 1740s and were not resolved until the British conquest of all French North American territories in the Seven Years' War.|$|E

5|$|From the Nore, Bellerophon {{proceeded}} to the Downs {{and joined the}} fleet stationed there. She spent three weeks in the roadstead, exercising her guns, before moving to Spithead. The diplomatic crisis with Spain had largely abated by October 1790, and Bellerophon was sent to Sheerness in late November. She remained in commission, still under Pasley, during the Russian Armament in 1791, but when this period of tension also passed without breaking <b>into</b> <b>open</b> war, Bellerophon {{was sent back to}} Chatham and paid off there on 9 September 1791.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Slaughter was the {{favorite}} choice {{for governor of}} Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break <b>into</b> <b>open</b> war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor. Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited him and asked whether he would run. Shelby assured {{him that he had}} no desire to do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1814 {{under the}} new and ambitious Governor-General Francis Edward Rawdon-Hastings, the Earl of Moira, the long-standing {{diplomatic}} disputes between British India and the Kingdom of Nepal, caused by expansionist policies of both parties, descended <b>into</b> <b>open</b> hostility. The British East India Company sought to invade Nepal not just to secure the border and to force the Nepali government to open trading routes to Tibet, but also for what Hastings saw as a geo-political necessity to secure the foothold of the Company in the Indian sub-continent.|$|E

As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police <b>into</b> <b>open</b> action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a French colony. The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Northumberland's {{relations}} with the other great northern family, the Nevilles, were friendly. He was already connected to the Beaufort-Nevilles through his marriage with Eleanor Neville, and in 1426 he married his sister Elizabeth to the young Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland. In the early 1440s, Northumberland was involved in other disputes. A conflict over land with the Archbishop of York escalated <b>into</b> <b>open</b> violence. The king intervened on the archbishop's side, though Northumberland remained in favour at court. Nevertheless, he spent less time involved in central affairs at Westminster in the later 1440s.|$|E
5|$|Maximian's campaigns {{were not}} {{proceeding}} as smoothly. The Bagaudae had been easily suppressed, but Carausius, {{the man he}} had {{put in charge of}} operations against Saxon and Frankish pirates on the Saxon Shore, had, according to literary sources, begun keeping the goods seized from the pirates for himself. Maximian issued a death-warrant for his larcenous subordinate. Carausius fled the Continent, proclaimed himself Augustus, and agitated Britain and northwestern Gaul <b>into</b> <b>open</b> revolt against Maximian and Diocletian.|$|E

5|$|These growing {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis finally spilled over <b>into</b> <b>open</b> war in 1167, {{triggered by a}} trivial argument over how money destined for the Crusader states of the Levant should be collected. Louis allied himself with the Welsh, Scots and Bretons, and the French king attacked Normandy. Henry responded by attacking Chaumont-sur-Epte, where Louis kept his main military arsenal, burning the town {{to the ground and}} forcing Louis to abandon his allies and make a private truce. Henry was then free to move against the rebel barons in Brittany, where feelings about his seizure of the duchy were still running high.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond's Norman {{relatives}} in Sicily {{had been in}} conflict with the Byzantine Empire for over 30 years; his father Robert Guiscard was one of the Empire's most formidable enemies. While Bohemond was away, Alexios sent an army to reoccupy Antioch and the cities of Cilicia. In 1107, having organized a new army for his planned crusade against the Muslims in Syria, Bohemond instead launched <b>into</b> <b>open</b> warfare against Alexios, crossing the Adriatic to besiege Dyrrhachium, the westernmost city of the Empire. Like his father however, Bohemond was unable to make any significant advances into the Empire's interior; Alexios avoided a pitched battle and Bohemond's siege failed, partly due to a plague among his army. Bohemond soon found himself in an impossible position, isolated in front of Dyrrhachium: his escape by sea was cut off by the Venetians, and Paschal II withdrew his support.|$|E
5|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1810 the Napoleonic Wars had lasted for seven years and the French Navy, {{over the course of}} the conflict, had been {{successively}} driven from the Atlantic until every French port was watched by a Royal Navy close blockade, ready to attack any French ship which emerged from harbour. In 1809, the main French fleet at Brest had attempted to break out <b>into</b> <b>open</b> water, only to be driven back and defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads. Much of the French effort at sea subsequently fell on commerce raiders, including privateers and frigate squadrons, often operating from smaller harbours such as those on the Northern coast of France in the English Channel. The two principal raiding ports were Cherbourg and Le Havre in Normandy, each of which maintained squadrons. In 1810, Cherbourg's anchorage held two ships of the line and a large, newly built frigate Iphigénie, while the frigates Elisa and Amazone were stationed at Le Havre.|$|E
