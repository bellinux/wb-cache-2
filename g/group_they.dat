40|$|The {{title of}} this paper is “An Analysis of Figurative Language in Raja Ali Haji’s Gurindam Duabelas. The {{objectives}} of the study are to find the figurative language and to find the dominating figurative language poured in Gurindam Duabelas.

Figure of comparison can be divided into four <b>groups.</b> <b>They</b> are Simile, Metaphor, Personification, and Allegory. Figure of opposition can be divided into five <b>groups.</b> <b>They</b> are Hyperbole, Litotes, Irony, Sarcasm, and Oxymoron. Figure of correlation can be divided into five <b>groups.</b> <b>They</b> are Metonymy, Synecdoche, Allusion, Ellipsis, and Inverse. Figure of repetition can be divided into nine <b>groups.</b> <b>They</b> are Pleonasm, Climax, Anticlimax, Rhetorical, Alliteration, Antanaclasis, Repetition, Parallelism, and Chiasmus. In this research, the writer found 33 metaphoric expressions, 8 personification expressions, 6 simile expressions, and 1 hyperbolic expression. The total of figurative language which is found in Gurindam Duabelas is 48. So, metaphor mostly use in this classics poem...|$|R
