5|$|The Sega CD {{received}} several variations during its lifetime, of which Sega constructed three. The original model utilized a <b>front-loading</b> motorized disc tray and sat underneath the Genesis. Sega later released the second {{model of the}} Sega CD, which was redesigned {{to sit next to}} the Genesis console and featured a top-loading disc tray in place of the motorized tray of the original model. In addition to the add-on models, Sega also released the Genesis CDX (Multi-Mega in Europe). This console was a combination of the Genesis and Sega CD in one unit and initially retailed at US$399. Unique to this model was its additional functionality as a portable compact disc player.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} NES, meanwhile, {{featured a}} <b>front-loading</b> cartridge {{covered by a}} small, hinged door that can be opened to insert or remove a cartridge and closed at other times. It features a more subdued gray, black, and red color scheme. An expansion port {{was found on the}} bottom of the unit and the cartridge connector pinout was changed.|$|E
25|$|When Nintendo {{released}} the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately {{different from that}} of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a <b>front-loading</b> zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the <b>front-loading</b> mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.|$|E
40|$|Objective/background: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to describe the acid-fast bacilli (AFB) yield of a <b>front-loaded</b> scheme in which an additional on-the-spot specimen (Xspot [Xs]) was collected 1 h after the first spot specimen and to compare the default rate between the <b>front-loaded</b> and standard schemes. The performance of the <b>front-loaded</b> sputum microscopy was also compared with the standard World Health Organization (WHO) method for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in Anambra State, Nigeria. Methods: A total of 1487 individuals with presumptive pulmonary TB participated. Participants' age ranged from 15 years and above. Three sputum specimens were submitted as spot–early morning–spot. An additional specimen (Xs) was submitted 1 h after the first spot. The sputum smears were stained using the Ziehl–Neelsen technique. Results: A total of 183 (12. 3 %) patients were AFB positive. The <b>front-loaded</b> scheme identified 182 (99 %) TB patients, whereas the standard scheme identified 183 (100 %) TB patients. The difference was not statistically significant (p >. 05). The first two specimens of each scheme (S–Xs vs. S–M) identified 176 (96. 2 %) and 181 (98. 9 %) of PTB patients, respectively. Neither difference was statistically significant (p >. 05). Default during the diagnostic process was 11 % in the standard but only 0. 7 % in the <b>front-load</b> scheme. The difference was significant (p <. 05). Conclusion: <b>Front-loaded</b> smear microscopy has similar performance compared with the standard scheme. More presumptive PTB cases defaulted in the standard than in the <b>front-loaded</b> scheme. <b>Front-loaded</b> smear microscopy could therefore be used in the diagnosis in PTB in Anambra State...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} key factors that {{influence}} a firm's decision whether to use <b>front-loaded</b> or rear-loaded incentives. When using price packs, direct mail coupons, FSI coupons or peel-off coupons, consumers obtain an immediate benefit upon purchase or a <b>front-loaded</b> incentive. However, when buying products with in-pack coupons or products affiliated with loyalty programs, promotion incentives are obtained on the next purchase occasion or later, i. e., a rear-loaded incentive. Our analysis shows that the innate choice process of consumers in a market (variety-seeking or inertia) is an important determinant of the relative impact of <b>front-loaded</b> and rear-loaded promotions. While in both variety-seeking and inertial markets, the sales impact and the sales on discount are higher for <b>front-loaded</b> promotions than for rear-loaded promotions, from a profitability perspective, rear-loaded promotions may be better than <b>front-loaded</b> promotions. We show that in markets with high variety-seeking it is more profitable for a firm to rear-load, and in markets with high inertia it is more profitable to <b>front-load.</b> Model implications are verified using two empirical studies: (a) a longitudinal experiment (simulating markets with variety-seeking consumers and inertial consumers) and (b) market data on promotion usage. The data in both studies {{are consistent with the}} model predictions. sales promotions, coupons, loyalty programs, marketing mix, competetive strategy...|$|R

2500|$|The NES {{hardware}} {{was also}} very influential. Nintendo chose the name [...] "Nintendo Entertainment System" [...] for the US market and redesigned the system so it would not {{give the appearance of}} a child's toy. The <b>front-loading</b> cartridge input allowed it to be used more easily in a TV stand with other entertainment devices, such as a videocassette recorder.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{innovation}} was the <b>front-loading</b> arrangement. Pioneer's angled cassette bay and {{the exposed}} bays of some Sansui models eventually were standardized as a <b>front-loading</b> door into which a cassette would be loaded. Later models would adopt electronic buttons, and replace conventional meters (which could be [...] "pegged" [...] when overloaded) with electronic LED or vacuum fluorescent displays, with level controls typically being controlled by either rotary controls or side-by-side sliders. BIC and Marantz briefly offered models {{that could be}} run at double speeds, but Nakamichi was widely {{recognized as one of}} the first companies to create decks that rivaled reel-to-reel decks with frequency response from the full 20–20,000Hz range, low noise, and very low wow and flutter. The 3-head closed-loop dual capstan Nakamichi 1000 (1973) is one early example. Unlike typical cassette decks that use a single head for both record and playback plus a second head for erasing, the Nakamichi 1000, like the better reel-to-reel recorders, used three separate heads to optimize these functions.|$|E
2500|$|Hossa's {{contract}} negotiations became {{the subject of}} controversy in early August. On 31 July, the Ottawa Sun originally reported that the NHL launched an investigation on Hossa's long-term deal. [...] Because the contract is front-loaded and expires by the time Hossa is 42, it was speculated whether retirement before expiry of the contract was part of the Blackhawks' negotiations. [...] Such an agreement would be considered by the NHL to be a circumvention of the salary cap and the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which would be subject to fines or the loss of draft picks. Even though the NHL did not fine or punish the Blackhawks, they later introduced a new rule preventing teams from <b>front-loading</b> contracts as lucratively as the Blackhawks did with Hossa.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{compares the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>front-loaded</b> coupons and rear-loaded coupons for new product market entry, by considering the existing brand’s promotion choice at the same time. Two experimental studies consistently show that for the new brand <b>front-loaded</b> coupons can lead to higher purchase intention and promotion appraisal than rear-loaded coupons. Moreover, the effect is more prominent when the existing brand carries no promotions or use rear-loaded coupons. These studies provide important implications on promotional type and timing decisions for new product market entry...|$|R

2500|$|On March 20, 1952, the Wage Stabilization Board {{issued its}} recommendations. The report {{called for an}} 18-month-long contract, with a pay {{increase}} of 12.5 cents retroactive to January 1, 1952, followed by a 2.5 cent an hour rise on June 30, 1952, and a 2.5 cent an hour rise on January 1, 1953. [...] Various improvements to fringe benefits were also made. The board also recommended the union shop. [...] In all, {{the cost of the}} pay hike ranged from 18 to 30 cents an hour, although 26 cents was the most quoted figure. The vote was 12 to 6, with all industry members of the WSB in the minority. The Board had not, however, included an automatic cost-of-living adjustment and only brought fringe benefits up to parity with other industries. And by <b>front-loading</b> the contract, the Board had practically ensured that inflation would outpace the wage increase, contributing to economic stabilization.|$|E
2500|$|At the 1985 Summer CES, Nintendo {{returned}} with a stripped-down version of the AVS, having abandoned the home computer approach. Nintendo purposefully designed the system {{so as not to}} resemble a video game console, and would avoid terms associated with game consoles, using the term [...] "Pak" [...] for cartridge, or [...] "Control Deck" [...] instead of [...] "console". Renamed the [...] "Nintendo Entertainment System" [...] (NES), the new version lacked most of the upscale features added in the AVS, but retained many of its design elements, such as the grey color scheme and boxy design. In avoidance of an obvious video game connotation, NES replaced the top-loading cartridge slot of the Famicom with a <b>front-loading</b> chamber for software cartridges that place the inserted cartridge out of view. The revised design includes design flaws which have the side-effect of making the NES more prone to breakdown. The loading mechanism became notorious for slowly failing. The Famicom's pair of hard-wired controllers was replaced with two custom 7-pin sockets for detachable controllers.|$|E
