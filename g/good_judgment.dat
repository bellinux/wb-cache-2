25|$|Examples {{of typical}} {{measurements}} are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs. frequency; impulse response under {{one or more}} conditions (e.g., square waves, sine wave bursts, etc.); directivity vs. frequency (e.g., horizontally, vertically, spherically, etc.); harmonic and intermodulation distortion vs. sound pressure level (SPL) output, using any of several test signals; stored energy (i.e., ringing) at various frequencies; impedance vs. frequency; and small-signal vs. large-signal performance. Most of these measurements require sophisticated and often expensive equipment to perform, and also <b>good</b> <b>judgment</b> by the operator, but the raw sound pressure level output is rather easier to report and so is often the only specified value—sometimes in misleadingly exact terms. The sound pressure level (SPL) a loudspeaker produces is measured in decibels (dBspl).|$|E
25|$|Zimmer Comes to the Front With an Indoor GameCharley Zimmer, the good-natured and gentlemanly catcher of the Cleveland Club has invented and {{patented}} {{an indoor}} game of base ball {{that ought to}} make him a little fortune. It promises {{to become one of the}} greatest toys of the age. A regular game can be played. The ball is pitched from an ingenious device and goes straight over the plate. If a hit isn't made or the ball struck at all the 'catcher' gets it. All the 'players' are in position, and there are regular catches in the outfield and pick-ups in the infield. The bat is a curious contrivance, and it takes <b>good</b> <b>judgment</b> to operate it. A fast or slow ball can be pitched, and the batter is liable to be 'fooled' by changes of pace. Nothing like it was ever seen before in toy games. The invention is to be shown in Hudson's window after Thanksgiving, and will surely attract great attention.|$|E

No, not our nation's, but in World War II. I mean, we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this century, but in this century's history"), self-contradictory and confused ("I have made <b>good</b> <b>judgments</b> in the past.

500|$|Annoyed that Peter {{spends more}} time {{watching}} television than with his own family, Lois suggests he teach Meg how to drive. Peter reluctantly agrees, and unwittingly gives Meg a series of bad driving tips, including instructing her to [...] "rev" [...] her engine twice at stop lights and challenge other drivers to a race, which causes her to ultimately fail her driving test. As Peter drives them home from the DMV he notices that a show he wanted to watch is on television in a nearby house. Distracted by the show, he crashes the car into the main cable television transmitter, knocking out reception for the whole entire town of Quahog. Panicking, Peter makes a promise to Meg so that if she takes the blame for knocking down the cable transmitter, she would get a new convertible when she finally gets her licence. Once they arrive home with the transmitter still attached to the car, Lois becomes furious with Peter for placing the blame on his own daughter. Meg, of course, is blamed, {{and is about to}} admit the truth, but then decides to keep quiet, reflecting with an inner voice, a reference to The Wonder Years, at school. This shows an incredible lack of <b>good</b> <b>judgment</b> and morals by Peter. Meanwhile, Stewie, (seeing the opportunity of the dish attached to car), steals the satellite dish in a plan to create a weather control device capable of destroying the world's supply of broccoli, since Lois had forced him to eat the vegetable earlier that day.|$|E

40|$|The {{real estate}} market {{has been known to}} suffer from inefficient {{information}} flow and uneven distribution of vital information. Carefully-crafted market/media reports can influence consumer sentiment and perception (i. e., the “framing effect”). Behavioral research in real estate has demonstrated that such framing effects can influence individuals' perceptions, which may consequently alter decisions made by housing consumers. In this paper, we find that framing effects influence university students and recent graduates with and without proper real estate academic knowledge. Academic real estate knowledge can be an important tool to fortify consumers against the bias created by the media. More practical knowledge and professional experience is needed in order for <b>good</b> <b>judgments</b> about future market performance to be made...|$|R

40|$|Quality {{management}} of school-based assessments School-based assessment offers many benefits over external tests and examinations. These benefits include {{attention to a}} greater range of important learning outcomes, greater integration of formative feedback for improvement, and generating a performance profile over time rather than on a single occasion. These fit with current understandings of human learning and with anticipated future demands on people and economies. A critical issue is how to establish confidence in school-based assessments. Greater confidence, and therefore stronger quality management, is needed for higher stakes assessment. A key component of successful school-based assessment is teacher expertise. Two kinds of expertise are involved: obtaining good information on student learning (using good assessment procedures); and making <b>good</b> <b>judgments</b> (applying relevant performance standards).

Simulations also indicate that the studied social recommendation mechanism can gradually improve the user experience by adapting to tastes of its users.
