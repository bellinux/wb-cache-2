60|$|Geraldine <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to be {{sure that}} they were alone.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bullsom <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The two maid-servants {{were at the}} sideboard.|$|E
60|$|I <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> We were {{absolutely}} alone, but I dropped my voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll be takin' some bit {{things that}} yon Whistlecrankie left," [...] said the gillie gravely, with a stolid <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|A <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{showed that}} <b>the</b> men had flown, and for good, for two valises which had {{stood in a}} corner were missing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am here to}} see you out of the house," [...] Macheson answered, {{with one}} breathless <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "Will you come quietly?" ...|$|R
60|$|Josephine {{accepted}} the easy-chair which he wheeled {{up for her}} and <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> critically.|$|E
60|$|More at her ease now she <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{and back}} at him. He smiled.|$|E
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Our hands fell apart. I lit a {{cigarette}} and looked at the open trunk.|$|E
6000|$|... "I ain't tickled {{to death}} about it. Home!" [...] with a scornful <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> barren of all comforts. [...] "A graveyard's a more cheerful place, to my notion." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{his face}} still turned away {{he lifted the}} cup to his {{chattering}} teeth. When he had drained it he threw a trembling <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and at <b>the</b> door.|$|R
60|$|Susan--or Nan Shelley--sat {{for a time}} in thought. Once in a {{while she}} would cast a furtive <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and its wall covered with trophies, and then she would turn to Sarah Judd's placid face.|$|R
60|$|She had {{not thought}} of Clarence. She turned hurriedly, <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and then peered down the dark stairway.|$|E
60|$|Draconmeyer's manner {{became more}} mysterious. He <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{as though to}} be sure that they were not overheard.|$|E
60|$|Granet silently obeyed. Sir Alfred <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> There was no {{possible}} hiding-place, {{not the slightest}} chance of being overheard.|$|E
60|$|The sub-mother {{looked out}} of the window, which opened upon {{little more than the}} once husband-sheltering apple-tree, and then, after a general <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> she looked at me, {{and for the first time}} {{addressed}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why strange?" [...] he answered, <b>glancing</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and {{lowering}} his voice a little. [...] "Don't you remember at our last meeting you promised {{to bring my}} tea a few hours later? Since then, I have not even seen you, nor have you sent me a line." ...|$|R
60|$|A hasty <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{revealed}} a door partly hidden by a curtain next the mantelpiece. Where {{it led to}} I did not know, but concluding that any place {{would be better than}} to remain in the library, I tried the door, found it open, and slipped out.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> for {{a moment}} or two, as though {{interested}} in the people. Satisfied at last that there was no chance of being overheard, he continued: ...|$|E
60|$|Royal Thatcher <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> took {{in all its}} dreary {{suggestions}} in a half-weary, half-indifferent sort of way, {{and dropped}} into the lawyer's own revolving chair as that gentleman entered from the adjacent room.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a short}} silence. Matravers <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with an inward shiver. The usual {{horrors of}} a {{suburban}} parlour were augmented by a general slovenliness, and an obvious disregard for any sort of order.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Mr. Grainger, [...] "Shorter's a good sort. Said he'd {{been here}} himself {{to see how}} you were fixed, and hadn't found you in. Uncommonly well fixed, I should say," [...] he added, <b>glancing</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with undisguised approval. [...] "Why the deuce did she furnish it, since she's gone to Paris to live with Rindge?" ...|$|R
60|$|Hunterleys {{smiled and}} <b>glanced</b> {{carefully}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> They were still free from any {{risk of being}} overheard.|$|R
60|$|He was {{surprised}} at the girl's quick comprehension, for she <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> luxurious <b>room</b> with a faint smile.|$|R
60|$|He was {{perfectly}} collected. He <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{with a smile}} of quiet amusement. A certain embarrassment seized the little party, and Lady Kelsey, as she shook hands with him, {{was at a loss}} for words.|$|E
60|$|He {{brought down}} his beer mug {{heavily on the}} table. In times of {{excitement}} his speech suggested the German idiom. Abruptly his air grew mysterious; he <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> now becoming empty, and lowered his voice.|$|E
60|$|They {{all laughed}} uproariously. Then Walter Crease, the journalist, leaned forward,--a {{man with a}} long, narrow face, yellow-stained fingers, and hollow cheekbones. He <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> before he spoke, and his voice sounded like a hoarse whisper.|$|E
6000|$|... "These--we English are strange people," [...] Dominey remarked, <b>glancing</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> after a {{brief but}} {{thoughtful}} pause. [...] "We advertise and boast about our colossal wealth, and yet we are incapable of the slightest self-sacrifice {{in order to preserve}} it. One would have imagined that our philosophers, our historians, would warn us in irresistible terms, by unanswerable scientific deduction, of what was coming." ...|$|R
60|$|Louis {{was silent}} for a moment. He <b>glanced</b> {{carelessly}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to assure himself that there were no listeners.|$|R
50|$|Panic {{begins to}} set in again when Andrew realizes that the house is {{completely}} out of food. Andrew <b>glances</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> eventually stopping and glaring at a noisy clock on the wall; within a few seconds it disappears. Andrew drops a stack of overdue bills in front of Dave, and within seconds the bills abruptly disappear. Dave puts one last theory to test, managing to hate away his need for food.|$|R
60|$|The man seated {{himself and}} <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> before replying. The big desk, {{littered}} with papers, the cabinet files and stiff chairs seemed {{to meet his}} approval. In the outer office a girl was busily clicking a typewriter.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young girl}} was evidently taken aback at this {{unanimity}} of opposition. She {{stared at them}} curiously, and then <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "We're quite comfortable here," [...] said the president explanatorily, [...] "and--in fact--it's just what we want." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Pettigrew, also flushed, {{rose to his}} feet. Jane {{acknowledged}} his greeting and <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> It was untidy, {{dirty and}} close, smelling strongly of tobacco and beer. On the table was a bottle of whisky, half empty, and two glasses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but he {{said you}} were to meet him there," [...] {{continued}} Markham, <b>glancing</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> empty <b>room</b> with a slight expression of relief.|$|R
60|$|Trent threw a swift <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{in which}} he found himself. It was barely furnished, and a window, thick with dust, {{looked out on the}} dingy back-wall of a bank or some public building. The floor was uncovered, the walls were hung with yellow maps of gold-mines all in the West African district. Da Souza himself, spick and span, with glossy boots and a flower in his buttonhole, was {{certainly}} the least shabby thing in <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|A faint rustle {{was heard}} inside, {{and the door}} slowly opened. A girl not yet twenty stood there, white-faced and tottering. She loosed the knob and swayed weakly, groping with one hand. Rudolf caught her and laid her on a faded couch that stood against the wall. He {{closed the door and}} took a swift <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> by <b>the</b> light of a {{flickering}} gas jet. Neat, but extreme poverty was the story that he read.|$|R
