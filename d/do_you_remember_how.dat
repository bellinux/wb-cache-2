6000|$|... "Mr. Allen," [...] {{she cried}} to the Celebrity, [...] "you must stop here. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> long we tarried over this bit on Friday?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} I was {{thinking}} about. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> also <b>how</b> he ridiculed the Louvre after {{his first trip to}} Paris, and swore that nothing would ever induce him to enter it again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, now; {{but before}} Nixon came {{we were a}} horrid set of little ruffians. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> Lance, <b>how</b> Roper offered you a bull's-eye in the Cathedral, and thrashed you {{afterwards}} because you wouldn't have it?' ...|$|R
5000|$|No. 29 - Millicent & Meebles - [...] "Horatio, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember?</b> ... My dearest, <b>how</b> could I forget?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With your love, if you {{can give}} it to me. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> you swore once that you would love me for ever and always?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ralph gave a mild {{ambiguous}} laugh. [...] "What a rage {{you have}} for marrying people! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> you wanted to marry me the other day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seven years! Yes. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>{{remember}}</b> <b>how</b> we {{said good-bye}} to the old place on that winter night after the auction? And {{do you remember what}} we resolved?" ...|$|E
6000|$|GREAT. It was; but he {{gave them}} {{encouragement}} withal. But what do we talk of them? they {{were a couple of}} lion-like men: they had set their faces like flint. <b>Do</b> not <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> undaunted they were when they stood before the judge? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here's {{the little}} hickory! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> father, <b>how</b> I got the seven-pounder on a burn-trout cast? No, you weren't there. That was a day. It was really only six and three-quarters. I put a stone {{in its mouth}} the second time we weighed it!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--and {{therefore}} I {{say that}} he may still live for years. My father, when he took to his bed at last, was manifestly near his death. The wonder with him was that he continued to live so long. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> the London doctor was put out because his prophecies were not fulfilled?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've seen Rendezvous' fresh promotion, I suppose? He's {{one of the}} men {{the young}} {{officers}} talk about. Everybody believes in him. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> Manning used to hide from him?..." ...|$|E
60|$|THE STATUE. Ha ha! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> I frightened {{you when}} I said {{something}} like that to you from my pedestal in Seville? It sounds rather flat without my trombones.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right you are!" [...] {{came from}} Tom, [...] "Oh dear, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> we served Mumps that night!" [...] {{and he set}} up a roar over the remembrance of the scene.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Better not,' said Leonard; 'she is so little, {{and these}} white walls might {{distress}} her fancy. They will remember our singing {{on the last}} Sunday evening instead. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> Ave, <b>how</b> they begged to stay on and on till it grew so dark {{that we could not}} see a word or a note, and went on from memory?' and he very softly hummed the restful cadence, dying away into ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't help it,' {{he said to}} me in private. 'I {{have always}} seen or felt, or {{whatever}} you may call it, things that others <b>do</b> not. Don't <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> nobody would believe that I saw Lucy Brooke?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! Then {{they must}} have {{had some sort of}} a row," [...] put in Tom. [...] "Well, it does beat the nation how the Baxters <b>do</b> it. Don't <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> Arnold Baxter escaped from the {{hospital}} authorities last year?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... he quoted. [...] "It's wonderful! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> I {{used to read}} Mariana in the South to you {{and poor}} Jenny? How it must have bored her! What an ass I was!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. Because {{you were}} cross, and surly, and {{thinking}} of nothing but your tobacco, I believe. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> we walked to Niddon, and you hadn't a word for anybody?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MARGARET (severely). Not you; so {{sure you}} could do it better yourself. That's you all over. Daddy, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> you taught me to balance a biscuit on my nose, like a puppy? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Philip!" [...] {{she cried}} with a blush, [...] "don't you know me? Have I changed much? I {{should have known}} you anywhere; and I am glad to see you, awfully glad (excuse the slang, but {{it is such a}} relief {{to be able to say}} 'awful' without being pulled up by Aunt Chambers). Just think, it is three years since we met. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> Grumps? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> I look? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think you will like me as much as you used to?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{happen to}} <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> Dacier {{translates}} Difficile est proprie communia dicere? I've {{made a note}} of it somewhere, but can't find it.

6000|$|... "No, Edgar is nice, too," [...] {{the girl}} said, frankly, [...] "and very strong. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> he carried me home {{more than two}} miles, when a year ago I fell down when I was out with you, and sprained my ankle. And now, Albert, perhaps some day you will get so strong {{that you may not}} think of going into the Church and {{shutting}} yourself up all your life in a cloister, but may come to be famous too." ...|$|R
6000|$|PETKOFF. You! (He gasps.) Sergius: <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> {{those two}} women went {{on this morning}} when we {{mentioned}} it? (Sergius smiles cynically. Petkoff confronts Raina severely.) You're a nice young woman, aren't you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's for {{the last}} time, Aunt Rachel. After to-day I can never talk of him, or even think of him. It's four years since he went away. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> he looked, Aunt Rachel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She was strong-minded enough too, if I {{remember}} right, at {{the last}} trial. I shall never forget how composed she was when old Bennett tried to shake her evidence. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> bothered he was?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is plenty}} of time," [...] he declared. [...] "Better to start late and build on a sure foundation, you know. A good many of my houses had to come down {{as fast as they}} went up. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> for instance, <b>how</b> I wanted to convert all your villagers by storm?" ...|$|R
5000|$|After Zhao's removal as chancellor, it {{was said}} that he was careful in his action and all he did was attend {{imperial}} meetings when called. Emperor Dezong approved of his carefulness, and in 804 made him the deputy minister of civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, Libu Shilang). When he met Zhao, he stated: [...] "I know that you, Lord, have closed your doors for six years, and therefore decided to give <b>you</b> this office. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> still <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> were given commissions on the same day as my old subject (Zhao Hua)?" [...] Zhao was so touched that he wept prostrate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here it is, here it is," [...] he said. [...] "Take it, White Beard, {{and kiss}} it once more, {{perhaps for the}} last time," [...] and he threw the {{crucifix}} to Brother John, who caught it and stared at it amazed. [...] "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> Fat Baby, <b>how</b> we caught you? You fought well, very well, but we killed you at last, and you were good, very good; we got much strength from you.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a lot has}} {{happened}} since those days," [...] said Sam, taking a deep breath. [...] "Tom, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> you got into trouble with old Crabtree {{the very first day}} we landed at Putnam Hall?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How pretty your holly is! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> {{we used to}} go {{and gather}} it for festivals like this, when we were happy children?" [...] he asked, looking up at her with eyes full of tender admiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "Always, Gavin. Has it {{not been}} {{selfishness}} to hope that you {{would never want to}} bring another mistress to the manse? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> angry you used to be in Glasgow when I said that you would marry some day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friends," [...] he said, [...] "I greet you {{who have}} decided to die with me, if need be, in defense of Jerusalem. I blame not those who have gone. They would not have gone, had the Lord {{required}} them to stay; but to you he has spoken, and has told you that he has need of your services. Henceforward, we will act as one band--a band of men inspired with one thought, and one aim. And now, though our numbers may not be great, yet a force so composed of men who hold their lives as naught may <b>do</b> wonders. <b>You</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> Gideon sent {{the greater part of}} his army away and, with a mere handful, defeated the hosts of the enemy! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{last time}} we met," [...] he went on, taking no heed of my words, [...] "was yonder at Nodwengu when the witch Mameena was tried for sorcery, she who made my brother mad and brought about the great battle, in which you fought for him with the Amawombe regiment. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> she kissed <b>you,</b> Macumazahn, and took poison between the kisses, and how before she grew silent she spoke evil words to me, saying that I was doomed to pull down my own House and to die as she died, words that have haunted me ever since and now haunt me most of all? I wish {{to speak to you}} {{concerning}} them, Macumazahn, for it is said in the land that this beautiful witch loved you alone and that you only knew her mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Le Geyt {{smiled a}} {{compassionate}} smile. [...] "Ah, I forgot," [...] she cooed, sweetly. [...] "Dear Hugo never CAN understand the upbringing of children. It {{is a sense}} denied him. We women know"--with a sage nod. [...] "They were wild little savages when I took them in hand first--weren't <b>you,</b> Maisie? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> dear, <b>how</b> <b>you</b> broke the looking-glass in the boudoir, like an untamed young monkey? Talking of monkeys, Mr. Cotswould, HAVE you seen those delightful, clever, amusing French pictures at that place in Suffolk Street? There's a man there--a Parisian--I forget his honoured name--Leblanc, or Lenoir, or Lebrun, or something--but he's a most humorous artist, and he paints monkeys and storks {{and all sorts of}} queer beasties ALMOST as quaintly and expressively as <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Mind, I say ALMOST, for I never will allow that any Frenchman could do anything QUITE so good, quite so funnily mock-human, as your marabouts and professors." ...|$|R
