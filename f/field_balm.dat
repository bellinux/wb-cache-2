50|$|Glechoma hederacea (syn. Nepeta glechoma Benth., Nepeta hederacea (L.) Trevir.) is an aromatic, perennial, {{evergreen}} creeper of {{the mint}} family Lamiaceae. It is {{commonly known as}} ground-ivy, gill-over-the-ground, creeping charlie, alehoof, tunhoof, catsfoot, <b>field</b> <b>balm,</b> and run-away-robin. It is also sometimes known as creeping jenny, but that name more commonly refers to Lysimachia nummularia. It has numerous medicinal uses, and is used as a salad green in many countries. European settlers carried it around the world, and it has become a well-established introduced and naturalized plant {{in a wide variety of}} localities.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{experimentally}} {{evaluate the}} antioxidant capacity of different fresh aromatic herbs (<b>field</b> <b>balm,</b> marjoram, parsley, rosemary, sage, sweet basil), several varieties of olives from Central Italy ('Carboncello', 'Rosciolo', 'Olivastro', 'Coratello', 'Leccino', 'Frantoio') and several types of fresh fruit (apple, apricot, banana, cherry, fig, grape, medlar, melon, peach, pear, pineapple, plum, water melon, yellow plum) using a superoxide dismutase (SOD) biosensor developed by the present authors. Measurements were carried out by comparing the biosensor response to the concentration of superoxide radical produced in solution using a xanthine/xanthine oxidase system in the presence and absence of the antioxidant sample considered. Tests carried out on different samples of fruit and aromatic herbs showed that the homogenised samples had better antioxidant properties than the centrifuged ones (obtained by centrifuging the homogenate), which sometimes gave extremely low antioxidant capacity values. The reliability of the proposed method was checked by comparing the trend of some experimental results found using the SOD biosensor with those {{reported in the literature}} obtained using the classic (ORAC) method. The precision of this method of analysis was found to be good for samples of aromatic herbs (RSD% {{less than or equal to}} 8 %), acceptable for homogenised fruit samples (RSD% less than or equal to 13 %) and less good for homogenised and centrifuged samples (RSD% less than or equal to 20 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Investigation of the {{formation}} of patterns in H-alpha spectroheliograms and filtergrams. Introducing a source-sink-control diagram, it is concluded that the H-alpha line source function in the quiet solar chromosphere is indirectly controlled by the photospheric radiation <b>fields</b> in the <b>Balmer</b> and Paschen continua. It is demonstrated that in producing the observed patterns, horizontal spatial variations {{in the shape of the}} absorption profile are extremely effective compared to changes in the source and sink terms. Applying this mechanism, asymptotic values are computed for the contrasts and visibilities in chromospheric H-alpha...|$|R
40|$|We present long-slit {{integrated}} spectroscopy of 238 late-type galaxies {{belonging to}} the Herschel Reference Survey, a volume limited sample representative of the nearby universe. This sample has a unique legacy value since ideally defined for any statistical study of the multifrequency properties of galaxies spanning a large range in morphological type and luminosity. The spectroscopic observations cover the spectral range 3600 - 6900 A at a resolution R ~ 1000 and are thus suitable for separating the underlying absorption from the emission of the Hbeta line {{as well as the}} two [NII] lines from the Halpha emission. We measure the fluxes and the equivalent widths of the strongest emission lines ([OII], Hbeta, [OIII], [NII], Halpha, and [SII]). The data are used to study the distribution of the equivalent width of all the emission lines, of the Balmer decrement C(Hbeta) and of the observed underlying Balmer absorption under Hbeta in this sample. Combining these new spectroscopic data with those available at other frequencies, we also study the dependence of C(Hbeta) and E. W. Hbeta_{abs} on morphological type, stellar mass and stellar surface density, star formation rate, birthrate parameter and metallicity in galaxies belonging to different environments (fields vs. Virgo). The distribution of the equivalent width of all the emission lines, of C(Hbeta) and E. W. Hbeta_{abs} are systematically different in cluster and <b>field</b> galaxies. The <b>Balmer</b> decrement increases with stellar mass, stellar surface density, metallicity and star formation rate of the observed galaxies, while it is unexpectedly almost independent from the column density of the atomic and molecular gas. The dependence of C(Hbeta) on stellar mass is steeper than that previously found in other works. The underlying Balmer absorption does not significantly change with any of these physical parameters.

This sample has a unique legacy value since it was ideally defined for any statistical study of the multifrequency properties of galaxies spanning a wide range in morphological type and luminosity. The spectroscopic observations cover the spectral range 3600 - 6900 angstrom at a resolution R similar or equal to 1000 and are thus suitable for separating both the underlying absorption from the emission of the H beta line and the two [NII] lines from the Ha emission. We measured the fluxes and the equivalent widths of the strongest emission lines ([OII]lambda 3727, H beta, [OIII]lambda 4959 and [OIII]lambda 5007, [NII]lambda 6548, H alpha, [NII]lambda 6584, [SII]lambda 6717, and [SII]lambda 6731). We used the data to study {{the distribution of the}} equivalent width of all the emission lines, of the Balmer decrement C(H beta), and of the observed underlying Balmer absorption under H beta (EW H beta(abs)) in this sample. Combining these new spectroscopic data with those available at other frequencies, we also study the dependence of C(H beta) and EW H beta(abs) on morphological type, stellar mass, stellar surface density, star formation rate, birthrate parameter, and metallicity in galaxies belonging to different environments (fields vs. Virgo cluster).
