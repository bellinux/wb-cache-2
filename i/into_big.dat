5|$|As {{the glaciers}} {{retreated to the}} {{northeast}} about 20,000 years ago, glacial lakes formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a sluiceway, or channel, that diverted the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. The retreating glaciers also left deposits of debris 20to 30feet (6.1to 9.1m) thick, which formed a dam blocking water from draining <b>into</b> <b>Big</b> Run. Instead water from Ganoga Lake and the area that later became Lake Jean was diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek. These diversions added about 7square miles (18km²) to the Kitchen Creek drainage basin, increasing it by just over 50percent to 20.1square miles (52km²).|$|E
5|$|Harvey was {{overlooked}} for Queensland {{selection for}} the whole 195253 season. He was recalled {{at the start of}} the 195354 campaign and made 26 and 20 in the first match against New South Wales, failing to convert his starts <b>into</b> <b>big</b> scores. He was retained despite making 15 and 0 in the next match against Victoria, but scored only 1 in the first innings of the match against South Australia starting on Christmas Day. Victoria were set 329 for victory, and having made only 62 runs in five innings for the season so far, he was the mainstay of the innings, scoring 102, but his team were all out for 245.|$|E

Because she was an impediment to the work of extension of the military harbour (which was now a full military complex with anti-atomic bunkers), Bretagne ultimately was salvaged from 1952 to 1954.

5|$|O'Neill {{started the}} 1964–65 {{tour of the}} West Indies strongly, scoring a century in the first match against Jamaica. He was often injured during the tour, but was at his most {{productive}} with the bat since the last series against the Caribbean team four years earlier. He made many starts, passing 20 in six of his seven Test innings, {{but was unable to}} convert them <b>into</b> <b>big</b> scores. In the First Test, O'Neill was struck on the hand by Wes Hall and was sent to hospital for X-rays after a break was suspected. During the Second Test, it was the turn of Charlie Griffith to send O'Neill to hospital, after hitting him on the forearm and causing a large bruise. His 51 and 74* in the Fourth Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, the last Test of his career, was the only time he passed 50 for the series. He ended with 266 runs at 44.33, missing the Fifth Test due to a broken hand. He managed a healthy return with the ball, taking nine of his 17 Test wickets in the series with an average of 25.55. This included his Test best of 4/41 with his leg-spinin the Second Test in Port of Spain, Trinidad. In this match, he cleaned up the hosts' tail in the first innings, removing Jackie Hendriks, Wes Hall, Charlie Griffith and Lance Gibbs.|$|E
