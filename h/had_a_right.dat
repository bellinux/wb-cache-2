5|$|Ljudevit Posavski, Croatian Duke of Pannonian Croatia, led a {{resistance}} to Frankish domination. Ljudevit {{also had to}} fight against Dalmatian Croatia, as their prince Borna was a Frankish ally. After unsuccessful resistance by Ljudevit and Pannonian Croats, the Franks again controlled Istria, Dalmatia, and Pannonia. Nevertheless, Dalmatian Croatia remained a semi-independent duchy between the two Empires, as they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to elect their own prince.|$|E
5|$|Apart from organising the federation, Welensky won a {{significant}} political battle in Northern Rhodesia against the British South Africa Company (BSAC), which controlled mineral {{rights and the}} associated royalties throughout the territory. The company, and not the British crown, had signed the treaties with African kings that surrendered mining rights, but the BSAC had stopped administering Northern Rhodesia in 1924. Welensky argued that the territory <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to the royalties, and petitioned the governor to take action. After many talks, the BSAC relented and agreed to surrender mineral rights in 1986, and to pay 20% of its profits from these rights to the government until then.|$|E

He {{was arrested}} in May of that year, and, in July, {{he pleaded guilty to}} charges of obstruction of IRS agents and the use of a false Social Security number (officials alleged that he had used four such numbers since 1984 in order to conceal his assets; Bell said that he did not believe anyone <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to know his real Social Security number).|$|E
50|$|Broadly speaking, the United States has two {{parallel}} justice systems, with laws, statutes, precedents, rules of evidence, and paths for appeal.

5|$|Idiots and lunatics {{had their}} land looked after by a court-appointed administrator, and any profits {{went into a}} trust fund to support the insane person. Due to the vested {{interest}} of the King (who would hold the lands) the actual lunacy or idiocy was determined by a jury, not by an individual judge. Under the Lunacy Act 1845 the Lord Chancellor <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to appoint a commission to investigate the insanity of an individual; {{as part of his}} role as Keeper of the King's conscience, however, he would only do this when it was beneficial to the lunatic, not simply because somebody had been found insane.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers of {{the time}} {{reported}} that the society promoted free love, but the society promoted free love only {{in the sense that}} consenting adults <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to change partners and even to have more than one partner at a time. Rather than promiscuousness, though, the society promoted tolerance, including tolerance of homosexuality. The Spirit Fruit Society, unlike most other communitarian groups of that time, did not seek to convert or recruit others to the group. Members were permitted to come and go as they pleased. The goal of the commune was not to convert or to expand membership in the society—it was simply to live as the adherents wished to live.|$|E

The British Ministry of Justice said that such a move would not be possible as Evans was a convicted sex offender on licence and, as such, barred from working abroad. Malta's Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, warned Hibernians that hiring Evans could affect the whole country's reputation, while Justice Minister Owen Bonnici stated that Evans <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to return to his profession after being released from prison.|$|E

5|$|The Menominee sued in the U.S. Court of Claims {{to recover}} {{compensation}} {{for the loss of}} their hunting and fishing rights. The Court of Claims first clarified that the Menominee Termination Act did not abolish the tribe or its membership, but merely ended federal supervision of the tribe. Since the Menominee was still a tribe, although not one under federal trusteeship, the tribe <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to assert a claim arising out of the Wolf River Treaty in accordance with the Indian Claims Commission Act and the Tucker Act.|$|E
5|$|The {{first to}} file suit over the {{election}} was Judge William M. Harrison, {{who had been on}} the Brooks ticket. He filed a Bill of Equity with the US Circuit Court in Little Rock, claiming he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to a seat on the Supreme Court due to the fraudulent election. The Brooks Campaign likewise filed suit in the Circuit Court shortly thereafter on January 7, 1873. Judge H.C. Caldwell heard the Harrison case, and rendered an opinion stating that the Federal Court had no jurisdiction in the matter, and dismissed the case. The Harrison decision resulted in the dismissal of the Brooks case as well.|$|E
5|$|Both Boycott and McGregor Blacker were {{involved}} in a protracted dispute with Mr Carr, the agent for the Achill Church Mission Estate, from whom McGregor Blacker leased the lands, and Mr O'Donnell, Carr's bailiff. The dispute began when Boycott and Carr supported different sets of candidates in elections for the Board of Guardians to the Church Mission Estate, and Boycott's candidates won. Carr was also the local receiver of wrecks, which meant that he was entitled to collect the salvage from all shipwrecks in the area, and guard it until it was sold in a public auction. The local receiver <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to a percentage of the sale and to keep whatever did not sell. In 1860 Carr {{wrote a letter to the}} Official Receiver of Wrecks stating that Boycott and his men had illegally broken up a wreck and moved the salvage to Boycott's property. In response to this accusation, Boycott sued Carr for libel and claimed £500 in damages.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1826, the Canal Company had {{insufficient}} funds {{to complete the}} work, and a special meeting authorised the taking out of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit. The canal was an obvious competitor to the River Tone Navigation, which was managed by the Conservators of the River Tone, a legal body created for that purpose by Act of Parliament in 1699. There was animosity between the Company and the Conservators, with the Company maintaining that they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to use the Tone to reach the centre of Taunton, and the Conservators maintaining that they did not. The canal {{was scheduled to be}} opened on 1 January 1827, but the opening was delayed until 3 January, as the connection to the River Tone was not made until 2 January. The opening celebrations were hampered by snow and bitter cold weather.|$|E
5|$|The NLRB {{applied a}} right it had {{recently}} announced in Quality Mfg. Co. and then clarified in Mobil Oil Corp. that employees in unionized workplaces <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) {{to the presence}} of a union representative during any inquiry where the employee's job might be in jeopardy. The NLRB had explained in those decisions that having a union representative present was an exercise of the right to the 'mutual aid and protection' protected by Section 7. Therefore, an employer's refusal of such presence was an unfair labor practice and actionable under the NLRA. As a result, the NLRB found that Weingarten had engaged in an unfair labor practice by refusing Collins a representative and Weingarten appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.|$|E
5|$|The Native Americans' victory {{celebrations}} were short-lived. Public {{shock and}} outrage at Custer's death and defeat, and the government's {{knowledge about the}} remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band {{across the border into}} the North-West Territories, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon and the chance to return. When crossing the border into Canadian territory, Sitting Bull was met by the Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} Western Han, {{imperial}} relatives and some military officers {{who had served}} Emperor Gaozu were made kings who ruled over large semi-autonomous fiefs, but once the non-related kings had died off, an imperial edict outlawed all non-Liu family members from becoming kings. The emperor's brothers, paternal cousins, brother's sons, and emperor's sons—excluding the heir apparent—were made kings. The emperor's sisters and daughters were made princesses with fiefs. Although the central government eventually stripped away {{the political power of}} the kings and appointed their administrative staffs, kings still <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to collect a portion of the taxes in their territory as personal income and enjoyed a social status that ranked just below the emperor. Each king had a son designated to be heir apparent, while his other sons and brothers were given the rank of marquess and ruled over small marquessates where a portion of the taxes went to their private purse. Although kings and marquesses enjoyed many privileges, the imperial court was at times aggressive towards them to check their power. Starting with Emperor Gaozu's reign, thousands of noble families, including those from the royal houses of Qi, Chu, Yan, Zhao, Han, and Wei from the Warring States period, were forcibly moved to the vicinity of the capital Chang'an. In the first half of Western Han, resettlement could also be imposed on powerful and wealthy officials as well as individuals who owned property worth more than a million cash.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 1561, cannons {{were fired}} in Leith to {{announce}} Queen Mary's arrival in Scotland. When she attended Mass being {{celebrated in the}} royal chapel at Holyrood Palace five days later, this prompted a protest in which one of her servants was jostled. The next day she issued a proclamation {{that there would be}} no alteration in the current state of religion and that her servants should not be molested or troubled. Many nobles accepted this, but not Knox. The following Sunday, he protested from the pulpit of St Giles'. As a result, just two weeks after her return, Mary summoned Knox. She accused him of inciting a rebellion against her mother and of writing a book against her own authority. Knox answered that as long as her subjects found her rule convenient, he was willing to accept her governance, noting that Paul the Apostle had been willing to live under Nero's rule. Mary noted, however, that he had written against the principle of female rule itself. He responded that she should not to be troubled by what had never harmed her. When Mary asked him whether subjects <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to resist their ruler, he replied that if monarchs exceeded their lawful limits, they might be resisted, even by force.|$|E
5|$|The old king's estrangement {{from his}} three daughters {{from his first}} {{marriage}} (Princesses Louise, Stéphanie, and Clémentine) spurred Leopold to keep or give as much wealth away as possible in order to disinherit the girls. An Austrian newspaper claimed that right before he died, Leopold personally gave Caroline his large collection of personal letters as well as documents detailing information about various European royal figures, which greatly worried his eldest daughter. After his death, the three princesses sued his estate for several million francs, although this was only a very small portion compared with the fortune he accumulated. The fortune was so large that the princesses were still attempting to recover some of Caroline's wealth four years after their father's death, claiming that Caroline and Durrieux had speedily ransacked one of Leopold's properties in Paris and seized important financial documents before the Belgian envoy to France appeared. A trust of $10,000,000 the king had placed in Caroline and their two sons' names became a target of the princesses; they and the Belgian government argued that the trust formed part of Leopold's private estate, and thus all three girls and the government <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to their share, as its funds had derived from the Congo Free State. The Belgian government's lawsuit succeeded, allowing them to collect the entire trust, but it also diminished the share the princesses received (as each collected a comparatively meager $1,000,000). Belgian statesman Emile Vandervelde later charged in an open letter that Leopold had given Caroline $6,000,000 worth of Congo bonds which had been found to be previously missing when Belgium annexed the colony.|$|E
2500|$|Some pro-life {{supporters}} {{argue that}} if there is uncertainty as to whether the fetus <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to life, then <b>having</b> <b>an</b> abortion is equivalent to consciously taking the risk of killing another.

5|$|These {{troubles}} {{were followed}} in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread throughout Europe {{during the following}} three years. The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe, {{about one-third of the}} population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, both of which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague {{throughout the rest of the}} 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages.|$|E
