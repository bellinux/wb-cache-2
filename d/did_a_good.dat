5|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Writer Gordon stated that director Bowman {{did a great}} job in mining his script for chills. In their book, X-Treme Possibilities, authors Keith Topping and Paul Cornell praised the episode, including Benzali's performance and the sequence in the graveyard {{at the end of the}} episode. Series creator Chris Carter called the episode one of the ones he was most proud of from the second season, stating that Gordon <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job with the script and Bowman {{did a great job}} with the directing.|$|E

He also <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job of bringing the car home, a highlight being ninth at Pau. In Noda's third season in F3000, he switched to the Forti Corse team to drive a Reynard 94D Cosworth as teammate to Pedro Diniz.|$|E

In addition to the mining industry, the town's merchants <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> trade with Sonora in Mexico as well as smaller regional mining camps. Harshaw received mail service on the Southern Pacific Railroad via Tombstone three times a week, and had its own newspaper, the Arizona Bullion, run by Charles D. Reppy and Company. The Bullion was launched on April 28, 1880, and had reached a circulation of 400 as of 1881.|$|E

25|$|In 1943, Harrison {{moved to}} New York City {{where he worked}} as a music critic for the Herald Tribune. While there he met Charles Ives, became his friend, and <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal in {{bringing}} Ives {{to the attention of the}} musical world, which had largely ignored him up to that point. With the assistance of his mentor Cowell, Harrison prepared and conducted the premiere of Ives's Symphony No. 3, and in return received help from Ives financially. When Ives won the Pulitzer Prize for Music for that piece, he gave half of the money to Harrison. Harrison also edited a large number of Ives's works, receiving compensation often in excess of what he billed.|$|E
25|$|Ahead of the {{municipal}} elections in September 1983, two parties, the Socialist Left and Liberal Parties, were clearly opposed to the advanced tolls, while two new parties, the Progress Party and Red Electoral Alliance, also were opposed. AMF therefore established a local list to run in {{the municipal}} election which would consist of members of the three parties which were in favor of the advanced tolls, the Labour, Conservative and Christian Democratic Parties. The list won four seats, while the Progress Party captured three and the Socialist Left Party increased from one to two. However, the Liberal Party fell from nine to five representatives. The Labour Party <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> election, as they captured many votes from people north and west on Askøy, who were generally positive to the advanced tolls.|$|E
25|$|Day Two (13 March): Australia {{found the}} {{inspiration}} {{they needed to}} get back into the match via their great fast bowler, Dennis Lillee. He took the wicket of Mike Brearley straight away, and within half an hour, England had crumbled to 5 for 40. Tony Greig mounted a very brief counterattack, hitting three fours, but he succumbed for 18 (the top score of the innings) and the crowd were stunned and elated when England finished with 95 off 34.3 overs. Lillee dominated proceedings, capturing a personal best of 6 for 26, ably supported by the medium pace of Max Walker, whose four wickets destroyed the middle order. With three and a half hours to go, to be followed by three full days of play, Australia needed not only a big score, but a long innings to allow the wicket to wear and make life difficult for England chasing a big target. Australia promoted spin bowler Kerry O'Keefe to open the batting in place of McCosker and he <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job, lasting until the new ball lost its shine. But England struck a decisive blow after O'Keefe departed, removing the Australian dangerman Chappell for two and Cosier for four, leaving Australia 3 for 53. Opener Ian Davis was still at the crease and he combined with veteran Doug Walters to add a half century partnership in the time remaining before stumps, leaving the match evenly poised.|$|E

500|$|Lawrence Tierney guest {{starred in}} the episode as Don Brodka. Another former show runner, Josh Weinstein, called Tierney's {{appearance}} [...] "the craziest guest star experience we ever had". In addition to yelling at and intimidating employees of the show, Tierney made unreasonable requests, such as abandoning his distinctive voice to do the part in a southern accent and refusing to perform lines {{if he did not}} [...] "get the jokes". Despite this, Oakley and Weinstein thought Tierney <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job. Weinstein said, [...] "He certainly delivered and he's one of my favorite characters we have had [...]" [...] After Tierney's death, the episode [...] "The Old Man and the Key" [...] was dedicated to him.|$|E

[...] The long cutscenes, which cannot be skipped, frustrated game journalist Tom Chick; he wanted to skip the scenes and continue playing instead of being forced to watch a clichéd story.

After initially expecting a [...] "filler" [...] episode, Ramsey Isler of IGN {{said he was}} [...] "pleasantly proven wrong", as the [...] "story {{turned out to be}} one of the best of the series". Isler continued that [...] "the writers really <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job of integrating the overall mythology into a standalone story that is actually damn good...

The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney's for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, [...] "I've always maintained that in this business, you're {{only as good as the}} other fellow thinks you are.

His partner Glen Morgan had a similar opinion, calling it [...] "a little too ordinary, like you have seen it before, which is exactly what the network wanted at the time. Chris Carter had a more positive view of the episode, calling it [...] "very well done, really great effects, and more of a meat-and-potatoes kind of story. An FBI sting and a good mystery that Mulder and Scully investigate. Overall, a really solid episode." [...] The plot for [...] "Shadows" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 2000 by Ellen Steiber, under the title Haunted.|$|E
500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Devil and Homer Simpson", {{was written}} by Daniels and McGrath. The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks {{the same as the}} devil Chernabog from the 1940 Walt Disney {{produced}} film Fantasia; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence. Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil because he is the one you would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job of playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character. Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as a bowling ball by a demon in hell.
