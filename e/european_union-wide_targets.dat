Methods: Data presented here refer to the Italian component of the <b>European</b> <b>Union-wide,</b> <b>European</b> Commission-funded, ReDNet project survey. An ad-hoc questionnaire was administered to professionals from the departments of Addiction, Psychiatry, Paediatrics and Emergency Room Services in Italy. Results: The interviewees' sample included 243 professionals, mostly from the departments of Addiction (35 %) and Psychiatry (28. 4 %). Overall, interviewees self-reported a poor technical knowledge relating to NPS; some 27 % of respondents confirmed of not being aware if their patients presented with a previous history of NPS misuse. Discussion: Novel psychoactive substances prevalence of misuse was not considered to be an unusual phenomenon in Italy, and most health professionals appeared to have concerns relating to associated medical and psychopathological risks, especially in terms of aggression/psychomotor agitation. Overall, most respondents reported the need to have better access to NPS-related reliable sources of informatio...|$|R

40|$|The {{unique and}} {{idiosyncratic}} project of governance of the Energy Union is mainly {{a response to}} the 2030 renewables and energy efficiency targets which are not nationally binding. In this way, the new proposed governance model resembles the design of the Paris Agreement mechanisms to some degree. A divergence with the Paris Agreement is that the Energy Union governance model does not foresee any ratcheting up of targets. The EU’s long-standing experience in monitoring and accounting of greenhouse gas emissions – both its <b>Union-wide</b> <b>target</b> and national targets has been helpful. However, despite some clear corrective measures for the greenhouse gas emissions target, many of the Commission’s tools to address gaps remain in the realm of soft governance.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} financial integration and output volatility at micro and macro levels. Using a very large firm-level dataset (AMADEUS) from 16 European countries, we construct a measure of "deep" financial integration at the regional level based on observations of foreign ownership at the firm-level. We find a significant positive effect of foreign ownership on the volatility of firms' outcomes in static as well as dynamic empirical frameworks. This effect survives aggregation and carries over to regional output, leading to a positive association between deep financial integration and aggregate fluctuations. To identify the causal effect of financial integration on volatility we exploit variation in the transposition dates of the <b>European</b> <b>Union-wide</b> legislative acts from the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP). We find that high trust regions located in countries who harmonized their capital markets sooner have increased levels of financial integration and volatility. firm volatility, foreign ownership, regional integration, social capital, macro volatility...|$|R
