5|$|Those {{countries}} have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole {{to a more}} standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire <b>English</b> <b>in</b> the process of growing up through day by day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners. Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of <b>English</b> <b>in</b> the inner-circle countries, {{and they may have}} grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well.
