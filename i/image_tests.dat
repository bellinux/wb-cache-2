40|$|OBJECTIVES: Magnifying {{narrow-band}} imaging (M-NBI) is {{more accurate}} than white-light imaging for diagnosing small gastric cancers. However, it is uncertain whether moving M-NBI images have additional effects in the diagnosis of gastric cancers compared with still images. DESIGN: A prospective multicenter cohort study. METHODS: To identify the additional benefits of moving M-NBI images by comparing the diagnostic accuracy of still images only with that of both still and moving images. Still and moving M-NBI images of 40 gastric lesions were obtained by an expert endoscopist prior to this prospective multicenter cohort study. Thirty-four endoscopists from ten different Japanese institutions participated in the prospective multicenter cohort study. Each study participant was first tested using only still M-NBI images (still image test), then tested 1 month later using both still and moving M-NBI images (moving image test). The main outcome was {{a difference in the}} diagnostic accuracy of cancerous versus noncancerous lesions between the still image test and the moving image test. RESULTS: Thirty-four endoscopists were analysed. There were no significant difference of cancerous versus noncancerous lesions between still and moving <b>image</b> <b>tests</b> in the diagnostic accuracy (59. 9 % versus 61. 5 %), sensitivity (53. 4 % versus 55. 9 %), and specificity (67. 0 % versus 67. 6 %). And there were {{no significant difference in the}} diagnostic accuracy between still and moving <b>image</b> <b>tests</b> of demarcation line (65. 4 % versus 65. 5 %), microvascular pattern (56. 7 % versus 56. 9 %), and microsurface pattern (48. 1 % versus 50. 9 %). Diagnostic accuracy showed no significant difference between the still and moving <b>image</b> <b>tests</b> in the subgroups of endoscopic findings of the lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of moving M-NBI images to still M-NBI images does not improve the diagnostic accuracy for gastric lesions. It is reasonable to concentrate on taking sharp still M-NBI images during endoscopic observation and use them for diagnosis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Umin. ac. jp UMIN-CTR 000008048...|$|E

Furthermore, QDM is exploited to achieve adaptive compression of geometrically distorted pictures, in order to ensure a uniform quality on the final <b>image.</b> <b>Tests</b> are performed using JPEG and JPEG 2000 coding standards in order to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the performance of the proposed method.|$|E

40|$|This practice-informed {{research}} establishes {{points of}} intersection between reanimative practices within moving image work and queer theoretical positions. It frames this within autoethnographic understandings of memories pertaining to my adolescent experience of gay acculturation via textual sources. A bricolage methodology deriving {{from the work}} of Kincheloe and Berry (2004) is used. Multiple methods of investigation are employed including alternative archive creation, moving <b>image</b> <b>tests</b> and prototypes, processes of reading and re-reading and autoethnographic, reflective and academic writing practices. Analysis and evaluation are informed by selected queer theoretical concepts which correspond to the broad structural phases of reanimation. Research outputs deriving from these processes are i) moving <b>image</b> <b>tests,</b> ii) autoethnographic vignettes, iii) a moving image piece entitled Unbounded and iv) a written thesis. The research aims to build on current understandings of the term “reanimation” (Cholodenko, 1991, 2004, 2007 a, 2007 b, 2007 c, 2009; Skoller, 2013; Wells, 1998; Wells & Hardstaff, 2008), particularly within moving image practices using “found” material, and to articulate these within a queer perspective. A contextual review assesses previous work on reanimation in research, scholarship and queer-related animation. A series of moving <b>image</b> <b>tests</b> establish a relationship between animation, deanimation and reanimation which, I propose, constitutes the reanimative process. I consider this practice-informed understanding in relation to analogous patterns and motifs in queer theoretical literature. Finally, evaluation of the evidence from my practice tests and the terminal piece, Unbounded, corroborate a proposed set of intersections. The conclusion offers a conceptualisation of the process of reanimation in my moving image practice and establishes that the reanimated outcome attests to its reanimated status through the “temporal composite” (Skoller, 2013). I build on work concerning queer forms of evidence (Muñoz, 1996, 2009), alternative archive creation (Cvetkovich, 2003), queer temporality (Freeman, 2010; Rohy, 2009; Stockton, 2009) and futurity (Bansel, 2012; Edelman, 2004; Muñoz, 2009) to demonstrate that this reanimative principle is reflective of contemporary queer concerns with historicity. This practice-informed research contributes to knowledge by extending a modest body of animation literature addressing sexuality (de Beer, 2014, 2015, January 21; Griffin, 1994; Halberstam, 2011; Padva, 2008; Pilling, 2012 b; Takahashi, 2014; Wells, 1998; Wood, 2008) through its focus on the formal aspects of reanimation and interconnections with the queer, as opposed to the more frequently addressed issue of queer representation...|$|E

40|$|Maximizing the {{efficiency}} of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in the unique Northern Australia climate (dry and wet seasons annually) is critical in particular for rooftop installations. Optimum system efficiencies are usually achieved during the dry season, due to consistent sunshine hours, minimal cloud cover and no rainfall. However, the rate of dusting and soiling occurring on the panel surfaces are also high during this period, reducing the system’s efficiency. One of the solutions to maintain the optimum efficiency is to clean the panels regularly. However, this was rarely done, especially for rooftop systems due to access problems, and is an added cost. In addition, the cleaning frequency differs from locations and technology types. This paper presents a non-evasive methodology in quantifying the amount of dust and soiling on solar PVs by investigating five different image-processing techniques. This study looks at analyzing color histograms and statistical properties of the captured PV images. An image-processing Toolbox were developed in this study by adopting the following techniques: binarization, histogram model, statistical model, image matching and texture matching. Two <b>image</b> <b>tests</b> were presented: controlled image and actual <b>image</b> <b>tests</b> with average errors of 12. 38 % and 10. 8 % were achieved respectively. Results showed that the binarization algorithm exhibited the fastest and the most accurate reading on the controlled image test and the image matching algorithm exhibited the highest accuracy on the actual image test. The methods of analyzing PV panel dusting and soiling were proven to be accurate, low-cost, easy to implement and critically, provides the end-user the necessary information in maintaining their PV system efficiency over the wet and dry seasons of Northern Australia...|$|E
