50|$|With {{automated}} face recognition, tagging, {{location tracking}} and widespread <b>digital</b> <b>authentication</b> systems many {{actions of a}} person become easily associated with identity, as a cause, sometimes privacy is lost and security is subverted. An identity system that builds on confirmed pseudonyms can provide privacy and enhance security for digital services and transactions. Cyberspace creates opportunities for identity theft. Exact copies of everything sent over a digital communications channel can be recorded. Thus, cyberspace needs a system that allows individuals to verify their identities to others without revealing to them the digital representation of their identities.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{authentication}} is {{the process}} of establishing confidence in user identities electronically presented to an information system. <b>Digital</b> <b>authentication</b> or e-authentication may be used synonymously when referring to the authentication process that confirms or certifies a person's identity and works. When used in conjunction with an electronic signature, it can provide evidence whether data received has been tampered with after being signed by its original sender. In a time where fraud and identity theft has become rampant, electronic authentication can be a more secure method of verifying that a person is who they say they are when performing transactions online.|$|E

With the visual aid provided by our method, digital signatures can be authenticated with better accuracy than using existing methods - even novices can examine the authenticity of a digital signature in most situations using our method. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted a comprehensive user study which confirms positively the advantages of our approach.

40|$|The {{existing}} <b>digital</b> data <b>authentication</b> {{methods are}} able to detect tampered regions, but are too fragile to resist incidental distortions. This paper will present a new digital signature scheme for image authentication by making use of image content (in the wavelet domain). Based on this concept, a structural digital signature (SDS) is constructed. SDS is a signature {{that can be used}} to judge whether an incoming modification is incidental or malicious. When the structure of an SDS is maintained near-complete, we classify the incoming modification as incidental; otherwise, it is malicious. Many incidental manipulations, which cannot be tolerated in previous digital signature or fragile watermarking methods, can now survive under the proposed scheme.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: The {{needs of}} {{computer}} forensics investigators have been directly {{influenced by the}} increasing number of crimes performed using computers. It {{is the responsibility of the}} investigator to ascertain the authenticity of the collected digital evidence. Without proper classification of digital evidence, the computer forensics investigator may ended up investigating using untrusted digital evidence and ultimately cannot be use to implicate the suspected criminal. Approach: The historical methods of verifying the authenticity of a hadith were studied. The similarities between hadith <b>authentication</b> and <b>digital</b> evidence <b>authentication</b> were identified. Based on the similarities of the identified processes, a new method of authenticating digital evidence was proposed, together with the trust calculation algorithm and evidence classification. Results: The new investigation processes and an algorithm to calculate the trust value of given digital evidence was proposed. Furthermore, a simple classification of evidence, based on the calculated trust values was also proposed. Conclusion/Recommendations: We had successfully extracted the methods to authenticate hadith and mapped it into the <b>digital</b> evidence <b>authentication</b> processes. The trust values of digital evidence were able to be calculated and the evidence can be further classified based on the different level of trust values. The ability to classify evidence based on trust levels can offer great assistance to the computer forensics investigator to plan their works and focus on the evidence that would give them a better chance of catching the criminals.
