Ashkenazi cholent usually contains meat, potatoes, barley and beans, and sometimes kishke, and seasonings such as pepper and paprika. Sephardi hamin contains chicken or meat, rice, beans, garlic, sweet or regular potatoes, seasonings such as turmeric and cinnamon, and whole eggs in the shell known as haminados. Moroccan Jews prepare variations known as dafina or skhina (or s′hina) with meat, onion, marrow bones, potatoes, chickpeas, wheat berries, eggs and spices such as turmeric, cumin, paprika and pepper. Iraqi Jews prepare tebit, using chicken and rice.|$|E

25|$|Venlafaxine {{indirectly}} affects opioid receptors (mu-, kappa1- kappa3- and delta-opioid receptor subtypes) {{as well as}} the alpha2-adrenergic receptor, and {{was shown}} to increase pain threshold in mice. When mice were tested with a <b>hotplate</b> analgesia meter (to measure pain), both venlafaxine and mirtazapine induced a dose-dependent, naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effect following intraperitoneal injection. These findings suggest venlafaxine's seemingly superior efficacy in severe depression as opioids become increasingly used as a measure of last resort for refractory cases.|$|E

500|$|Members of the United States {{armed forces}} are exposed to CS during initial {{training}}, and during training refresher courses or equipment maintenance exercises, using CS tablets that are melted on a <b>hotplate.</b> This is to demonstrate the importance of properly wearing a gas or protective mask, as the agent's presence quickly reveals an improper fit or seal of the mask's rubber gaskets against the face. Following exposure while wearing a mask, recruits are ordered to remove the masks and endure exposure in the room. These exercises also encourage confidence {{in the ability of}} the equipment to protect the wearer from such chemical attacks. Such an event is a requirement for graduation from United States Army Basic Training, Air Force Basic Military Training, Navy Basic Training, and Marine Corps recruit training. CS gas in the form of grenades is also used extensively in the United States Marine Corps and United States Army in some service schools. CS gas is used during the final field exercise of the Scout Sniper Basic Course to simulate being compromised. In addition, it is used during the [...] escape-and-evasion exercise ("Trail of Tears"), the last event before graduation from the course. It is also used during several events in the Marine Corps Basic Reconnaissance Course (BRC) including some rucksack runs and escape-and-evasion exercises. While students going through the course are given the opportunity to bring and wear a gas mask for the event, usually none are worn because once donned, gas masks could not be removed {{until the end of the}} exercise. This could last anywhere from 3–12 hours and would make running 25km while wearing [...] of gear virtually impossible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Microcantilever <b>hotplates</b> use the {{self-heating}} phenomenon {{to achieve}} the required large, uniform temperature field or the cantilever-tip movement. The present study investigates the effect of self-heating on temperature and its distribution in microcantilever <b>hotplates</b> in monolith and u-shape configuration with different substrate materials, operating environments and applied voltages. The cantilevers are made of Si and SiO 2 with a p-type Si resistor embedded. The cantilevers are operated in air and water at different applied voltages. The numerical analysis uses finite element analysis software ANSYS Multiphysics. Results show that monolith and u-shape cantilevers have similar temperature distributions, but the maximum temperature values in u-shape cantilever are higher...|$|R

2500|$|Asbestos mining existed {{more than}} 4,000 years ago, but {{large-scale}} mining {{began at the}} end of the 19th century, when manufacturers and builders began using asbestos for its desirable physical properties. Some of those properties are sound absorption, average tensile strength, affordability, and resistance to fire, heat, and electricity. It was used in such applications as electrical insulation for <b>hotplate</b> wiring and in building insulation. When asbestos is used for its resistance to fire or heat, the fibers are often mixed with cement or woven into fabric or mats. These desirable properties made asbestos very widely used. Asbestos use continued to grow through most of the 20th century [...] until public knowledge (acting through courts and legislatures) of the health hazards of asbestos dust outlawed asbestos in mainstream construction and fireproofing in most countries.|$|E

In 1983, building inspectors visited the site and verified that the new extension had been built according to the dimensions specified on the building permit. Fritzl had illegally enlarged the room by excavating space for a much larger basement, concealed by walls.

2500|$|When Entity FX {{took over}} the duties of {{creating}} the digital effects for the series, they also {{took over the}} challenge of crafting effects that would illustrate Clark’s super-powered abilities, including the new [...] "heat vision" [...] that was introduced this season. The visual effects for heat vision evolved {{over the course of}} the first season, until Gough and Millar agreed on one that reflected their image of what heat vision should look like; they did not want the usual [...] "red beams" [...] or [...] "laser vision". The visuals developed from the idea that they wanted Clark to be able to use it in front of people without them being able to see it. What emerged was a [...] "heat ripple" [...] from [...] "distorting the frame". John Wash explains what the creators were looking for:" [...] wanted to be fairly accurate in terms of what you might see from something that was searingly hot traveling through the air, like a disturbance of the atmosphere. We keyed our research off the little ripples that you see if a light goes past a <b>hotplate</b> and reflects on a wall. We used a computer to create a conical version of that effect that could emanate from Clark's eyes, in combination with a little effect." [...] They used [...] "blobs of heat vision" [...] instead of [...] "constant rays" [...] for the first instances of Clark using his ability, in an effort to simulate Clark's attempts to control it. A couple of episodes later in [...] "Red", the special effects team would use similar techniques for red kryptonite. To illustrate red kryptonite’s effect on Clark, and it releasing his inhibitions, the special effects team crafted digital effects in his eyes. Brian Harding tweaked the effects they were already using for Clark’s heat vision, giving them a [...] "little devilish, hellish red flicker" [...] in Clark’s iris. To help illustrate Clark’s super speed, Mat Beck and his team would slow down and speed up background settings in a single shot. For example, in [...] "Ryan", when Clark speeds up to the camera everything else slows to a stop—leaves stop blowing and birds are frozen in mid-flight—then everything begins moving normally as Clark races away from the camera. Entity FX also adds a blurring effect to Clark's body, as well as a distortion to the background to help further illustrate the speed at which Clark travels.|$|E

40|$|In this communication, {{we report}} on the {{integration}} of metal-oxide gas sensors on polymeric micro-hotplates made on polyimide and silicon substrates. Low-power consumption micro-hotplates with platinum electrodes and heaters were fabricated on polyimide membranes. Their thermal behavior was optimized using temperature probing at the micro-scale level coupled with thermal simulations. Tin oxide thick films were successfully integrated on these polyimide micro-hotplates using the drop coating technique. The annealing process of the tin oxide drops on the polyimide substrate was investigated and gas measurements are presented. Compared to the polyimide <b>hotplates</b> on silicon substrates, the <b>hotplates</b> made on polyimide sheets are simpler to process and more robust, and therefore, they are more suitable for the integration of metal-oxide films. Finally, a wafer level packaging technique using multiple polyimide layers was developed and led to a polymeric platform for metal oxide sensors. The technology is also promising for the integration of polyimide humidity sensors, of resistive and capacitive gas-sensitive polymeric films to realise fully flexible gas sensor arrays...|$|R

To investigate the plated nickel diffusion barrier, fast degradation of full size 156 × 156  mm² cells at elevated temperatures on <b>hotplates</b> and module degradation in the climate chamber executing a damp heat test were performed.
