5000|$|When {{the debt}} ceiling is {{actually}} reached without {{an increase in}} the limit having been enacted, Treasury will need to resort to [...] "extraordinary measures" [...] to temporarily finance government expenditures and obligations until a resolution can be reached. The Treasury has never reached the point of exhausting extraordinary measures, resulting in default, although on some occasions, Congress appeared like it would allow <b>a</b> <b>default</b> <b>to</b> take place. If this situation were to occur, it is unclear whether Treasury would be able to prioritize payments on debt <b>to</b> avoid <b>a</b> <b>default</b> on its bond obligations, but it would at least have <b>to</b> <b>default</b> on some of its non-bond payment obligations. <b>A</b> protracted <b>default</b> could trigger <b>a</b> variety of economic problems including a financial crisis, and a decline in output that would put the country into an economic recession.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} three ¢ndings {{concerning the}} mechanisms of depth perception. First, {{the shape of the}} three-dimensional percept evoked by two-frame motion is de¢ned solely by the rotation component around an axis in the frontoparallel plane; the visual system assigns <b>a</b> <b>default</b> value <b>to</b> this rotation component to arrive at a unique solution. Second, when the visual axes of two eyes are almost parallel, the visual system uses <b>a</b> <b>default</b> vergence value <b>to</b> reconstruct stereoscopic depth. Third, the default vergence and default rotation angles are highly correlated across subjects. This correlation implies that the two modalities share <b>a</b> common scaling <b>default</b> at <b>an</b> internal level...|$|R

30|$|Black and Scholes (1973) {{option pricing}} theory which was {{extended}} by Metron (1974) is applied <b>to</b> model <b>default</b> in structural based models. In these models firms can default on its debt obligation {{only at the}} time of maturity. Later, some models were developed by extension <b>to</b> allow <b>a</b> <b>default</b> <b>to</b> occur before the date of maturity. These models were familiarized by Black and Cox (1976), Lonfstaff and Schwartz (1995), Leland and Toft (1996). On the other hand, reduced form models focus over modeling <b>default</b> explicitly as <b>an</b> intensity or compensator process. Some of the notable market-based studies in the Indian market based upon Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) reference are Varma and Raghunathan (2000), Kulkarni et al.

40|$|Why do {{sovereign}} states sometimes fail to settle territorial disputes peacefully? Also, why do even peaceful settlements of territorial disputes rarely {{call for the}} resulting border to be unfortified? This paper explores a class of {{answers to these questions}} that is based on the following premise: States can settle a territorial dispute peacefully only if (1) their payoffs from a peaceful settlement are larger than their expected payoffs from <b>a</b> <b>default</b> <b>to</b> war, and (2) their promises not to attack are credible. This premise directs the analysis to such factors as the advantage of attacking over both defending and counterattacking, the divisibility of the contested territory, the possibility of recurring war, the depreciation or obsolescence of fortifications, and inequality in the effectiveness of mobilized resources. ...|$|R
