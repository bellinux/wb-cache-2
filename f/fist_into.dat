60|$|By {{this time}} he was shuddering rapidly. A {{peculiar}} feeling, as if his belly were turned into nothingness, made him want to press his <b>fists</b> <b>into</b> his abdomen. He remained shuddering drunkenly, like a drunken man who is sick, incapable of thought or action.|$|R

60|$|So {{strong and}} deep was this wave of despondency, this {{suggestion}} of impending disillusionment, {{that he started}} to his feet.

60|$|The gluttonous Teddy stuffed his <b>fists</b> <b>into</b> {{his eyes}} and lifted up his voice.

50|$|Plunging his <b>fists</b> <b>into</b> {{the molten}} {{heart of the}} dragon Shou-Lao the Undying infused the dragon's superhuman energy into Rand.
