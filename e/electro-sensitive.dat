50|$|Some {{fish have}} {{permanently}} protruding upper jawbones called rostrums. Billfish (marlin, swordfish and sailfish) use rostrums (bills) to slash and stun prey. Paddlefish, goblin sharks and hammerhead sharks have rostrums packed with electroreceptors which signal {{the presence of}} prey by detecting weak electrical fields. Sawsharks and the critically endangered sawfish have rostrums (saws) which are both <b>electro-sensitive</b> and used for slashing. The rostrums extend ventrally {{in front of the}} fish. In the case of hammerheads the rostrum (hammer) extends both ventrally and laterally (sideways).|$|E
5000|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} adopted for marking paper. In the telegraphic siphon recorder of 1858 a fine capillary tube is connected to an ink reservoir and is deflected by the process signal. In modern strip chart recorders, a disposable cartridge combining both a fiber-tipped pen and ink reservoir has been used. Other types of recorder use a heated stylus and thermally sensitive paper, an impact printer using a ribbon and an electrically operated hammer, an electric signal acting through a stylus onto <b>electro-sensitive</b> paper, or an electric spark that makes a visible spot on aluminized paper. One form of sensitive and high-speed recorder used beams of ultraviolet light reflected off mirror galvanometers, directed at light-sensitive paper.|$|E
5000|$|The type species Sulcusuchus erraini {{was named}} in 1990 by Zulma Brandoni de Gasparini and Luis Spalletti. It {{was at first}} {{considered}} {{to have been a}} dyrosaurid crocodile, hence its generic name: [...] "trough crocodile". Its holotype, MPEF 650, was at Jacobacci, RÃ­o Negro Province, uncovered in a layer of the late Campanian La Colonia Formation. It consists of a posterior left mandible fragment of about half a meter long with an associated jaw joint condyle of the skull, lower braincase, rear palate and middle snout fragment. The outer side of the mandible shows the trough, which would be exceptional for a crocodile. The mandibula and pterygoids show grooves that may have housed <b>electro-sensitive</b> organs. The snout is very elongated and the pterygoids are fused.|$|E

In particular, we have designed and implemented a system to create optimum traffic signals in congested conditions. The effectiveness of this method was shown through simulation of multiple intersections...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe weakly {{electric}} {{fish can}} perform complex cognitive tasks based on extracting information from blurry electric images projected from their immediate environment onto their <b>electro-sensitive</b> skin. In particular {{they can be}} trained to recognize the intrinsic properties of objects such as their shape, size and electric nature. They do this by means of original perceptual strategies that exploit {{the relations between the}} physics of a self generated electric field, their body morphology and the ability to perform specific movement termed Probing Motor Acts (PMA). In this article we artificially reproduce and combine these PMA to build an autonomous control strategy that allows an artificial electric sensor to find electrically contrasted objects and to orbit around them based on a minimum set of measurements and simple reactive feedback control laws of the probe's motion. The approach does not require any simulation model and could be implemented on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) equipped with artificial electric sense. The AUV has only to satisfy certain simple geometric properties, such as bilaterally (left/right) symmetrical electrodes and possess a reasonably high aspect (length/width) ratio...|$|E

Electrically {{sensitive}} polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels loaded with methotrexate (MTX) were prepared via a solution casting process, and characterized by attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectrometry. In order {{to determine if the}} hydrogels were <b>electro-sensitive</b> or not, bending tests were conducted on the sulfoacetic acid modified hydrogels. It was observed that the prepared samples into strip forms started bending towards the cathode, and this bending was reversible when the polarity of the applied voltage was changed. The drug release study was performed on the MTX-loaded hydrogel strips placed in a sodium chloride (NaCl) solution under three different voltages (e. g., 0 V, 5 V, 10 V, and 20 V). Subsequently, the solutions were collected every five minutes {{in order to determine the}} drug release behaviors of the hydrogels using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer. The test results showed that sulfoacetic acid (SA) -modified PVA hydrogels possess electrical sensitive behavior and kept their electric sensitivity for a long period of time. Also, the results confirmed that the control drug release could be achieved under different electrical voltages...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Hydrogels are {{cross linked}} {{polymeric}} network, {{which have the}} ability to hold water within the space available among the polymeric chains. The hydrogels have been used extensively in various biomedical application, viz. drug delivery, cell carriers and/or entrapment, wound management and tissue engineering. Hydrogels are swellable polymeric materials, have been widely as a carrier of drug delivery systems. These biomaterials have gained attention owing to their peculiar characteristics like swelling in aqueous medium, pH and temperature sensitivity or sensitivity towards other stimuli. Hydrogels being biocompatible material have been recognized to function as drug protectors, especially of peptide and proteins, from in vivo environment. Also these swollen polymers are helpful as targetable carriers for bioactive drugs with tissue specificity and environmental sensitive hydrogels have enormous potential for various environmental variables, such as low pH and elevated temperature, are found in the body. For this reason, either pH sensitive and /or temperature- sensitive hydrogels can be used for site specific controlled drug delivery. Light sensitive, pressure- responsive and <b>electro-sensitive</b> hydrogels also have the potential to be used in drug delivery and bioseparation. This article presents an overview to the range of application of hydrogels and advances in hydrogels based drug delivery that have become the interest of researchers...|$|E
40|$|<b>Electro-sensitive</b> (ES) {{elastomers}} form a {{class of}} smart materials whose mechanical properties can be changed rapidly by the application of an electric field. These materials have attracted considerable interest recently because of their potential for providing relatively cheap and light replacements for mechanical devices, such as actuators, and also {{for the development of}} artificial muscles. In this paper we are concerned with a theoretical framework for the analysis of boundary-value problems that underpin the applications of the associated electromechanical interactions. We confine attention to the static situation and first summarize the governing equations for a solid material capable of large electroelastic deformations. The general constitutive laws for the Cauchy stress tensor and the electric field vectors for an isotropic electroelastic material are developed in a compact form following recent work by the authors. The equations are then applied, {{in the case of an}} incompressible material, to the solution of a number of representative boundary-value problems. Specifically, we consider the influence of a radial electric field on the azimuthal shear response of a thick-walled circular cylindrical tube, the extension and inflation characteristics of the same tube under either a radial or an axial electric field (or both fields combined), and the effect of a radial field on the deformation of an internally pressurized spherical shell...|$|E
40|$|<b>Electro-sensitive</b> {{elastomers}} are {{materials that}} can support large elastic deformations {{under the influence}} of an electric field. There has been growing interest recently in their applications as so-called "smart materials". This paper is devoted to the derivation of universal relations {{in the context of the}} nonlinear theory of electroelasticity that underpins such applications. Universal relations are equations relating the components of the stress, the electric variables and the deformation that are independent of the constitutive law for a family of materials. For the general constitutive equations of an isotropic electroelastic material derived from a free energy function and for some special cases of these equations, we obtain universal relations, the word "universal" being relative to the considered class or subclass of constitutive laws. These universal relations are then applied to some controllable states (homogeneous and non-homogeneous) in order to highlight some examples that may be useful from the point of view of experimental characterization of the material properties. Additionally, we examine the (non-controllable) problem of helical shear of a circular cylindrical tube in the presence of a radial electric field, and we find that a nonlinear universal relation that has been obtained previously for an elastic material also holds when the electric field is applied...|$|E

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringMethotrexate (MTX) -loaded {{electric}} field-sensitive sulfoacetic acid modifying polyvinyl alchohol (PVA) hydrogels {{were prepared}} and characterized {{by means of}} attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectrometry. To see whether the hydrogels were <b>electro-sensitive,</b> bending tests were conducted. It was seen that the samples that were cut into strips started bending toward the cathode, and this bending was reversible when the polarity changed. Drug release tests were conducted using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer, and a drug release study {{was performed on the}} MTX-loaded hydrogel strips placed in a sodium chloride (NaCl) solution under three different voltages (V) - 5 V, 10 V, and 20 V-and the solutions collected every five minutes. Also, a drug-release test without applying any voltage was carried out. Solutions collected from the tank every five minutes were investigated using UV-Vis spectrometry, and absorption peaks were obtained. Results showed that the strips exhibited higher drug release properties when the voltage was increased. The maximum drug release was at 20 V and minimum at 0 V. A cytotoxicity (in vitro) test was done to observe the release behavior of the hydrogels and also to witness the efficiency of the treatment on cancer.

40|$|The sensory system {{initiating}} C-response {{and electric}} organ discharge (EOD) {{response in the}} hearing specialist elephantnose fish was studied in an experimental swing chamber set-up. The swing chamber is specially designed for producing controlled low frequency acoustic stimulus waveforms. The waveforms studied in the experiments were single cycle sinusoids of initial acoustic pressure and particle acceleration in the frequency range 10 Hz to 30 Hz, and mimicked key components in the acoustic signature of charging predatory fish attacks. The aim {{of the study was}} to reveal how initial acoustic pressure and particle acceleration trigger the inner ear sensory system in elephantnose fish to produce acoustic EOD- and C-responses. Acoustic startle behaviour was found to be optimally triggered by a combination of acoustic particle acceleration and compression, and very rarely by the same level of acoustic particle acceleration and rarefaction. Startle behaviours were highly directional, and this was ascribed to inner ear detection and coding of the direction of the initial particle acceleration. In the centre of the test chamber, acoustic startle behaviours were triggered by the particle acceleration component alone, but at significantly lower probability than when combined with compression. Startle behaviours observed in response to the low frequency stimuli greatly extended the known audible hearing range in elephantnose fish. Contrary to general opinion within the field of fish hearing, it was shown that acoustic pressure sensitivity is of behavioural relevance at very low sonic and infrasonic frequencies. The results of the study support the view that acute acoustic pressure sensitivity evolved independently several times in fish as adaptations to perform differentiated and more adaptable escapes from striking predatory attacks. EOD-responses were produced by the acoustic stimuli, and were significantly stronger to compression stimuli than to rarefaction stimuli. Why elephantnose fish emit a strong burst of EODs during acoustic startle behaviour is unclear, but may perhaps be as a distraction of <b>electro-sensitive</b> predators...|$|E
