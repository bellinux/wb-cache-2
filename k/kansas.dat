5|$|After <b>Kansas</b> {{failed to}} convert a shot on their next possession, North Carolina {{proceeded}} {{to pass the}} ball {{around the perimeter of}} the court for close to two minutes. After finding the right setup, Lennie Rosenbluth drove to the basket and scored. Following that possession, <b>Kansas</b> began to make outside jump shots. When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved jump shots led to a 102 <b>Kansas</b> run, with <b>Kansas</b> taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain in order to make him score from the free throw line, they began to get into foul trouble. Kansas' coach Dick Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with their next possession. Harp's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not able to overcome Kansas' three point lead; <b>Kansas</b> did not attempt a shot for over five minutes.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Smith {{attended}} the University of <b>Kansas</b> on an academic scholarship where he majored in mathematics and joined Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.

During his time on the varsity basketball team, <b>Kansas</b> won the national championship in 1952 and were NCAA tournament finalists in 1953. Smith's basketball coach during his time at <b>Kansas</b> was Phog Allen, who had been coached at the University of <b>Kansas</b> by the inventor of basketball, James Naismith. After graduation, Smith served as assistant coach at <b>Kansas</b> in the 1953–54 season.|$|E
5|$|After the missed field goal, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on offense {{at its own}} 27-yard line. Running back Kenny Lewis, Jr., {{replacing}} the suspended Branden Ore, ran for a first down, and Tyrod Taylor connected on an 11-yard pass to Eddie Royal for another first down. Now inside <b>Kansas</b> territory, Taylor attempted another pass. <b>Kansas</b> All-American cornerback Aqib Talib jumped between Taylor's throw and the receiver, intercepting the ball. Talib returned the interception 60yards to the end zone for a <b>Kansas</b> touchdown—the first points of the game. An extra point kick by Scott Webb made the score 70 <b>Kansas</b> with 5:15 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} round of the NCAA Tournament, <b>Kansas</b> faced Southern Methodist and was forced into an {{overtime}} period. Behind 36 points by Chamberlain, the Jayhawks won 7365 to advance to the regional finals. There, the Jayhawks defeated Oklahoma City 8161 to reach the Final Four. Chamberlain posted 30 points in the contest, adding 15 rebounds. The twotime defending NCAA Tournament champions, San Francisco, faced <b>Kansas</b> in the Final Four's host site, <b>Kansas</b> City. With a field goal percentage of almost 60 percent, the Jayhawks posted an 80–56 win to advance to the championship game against undefeated North Carolina, the number oneranked team in the country. Even though the Tar Heels were undefeated and ranked number 1 in the nation, <b>Kansas</b> entered the game as a 3point favorite, mostly because playing in <b>Kansas</b> City was a virtual home game.|$|E
5|$|Jud Dunlevy {{kicked the}} ball, which {{traveled}} the regulation 10yards, but was recovered by <b>Kansas.</b> The Hokies, despite failing {{to recover the}} onside kick, still had a chance for another offensive possession if they stopped Kansas' offense short of a first down. Because the Hokies had two timeouts remaining, they could stop the clock after two <b>Kansas</b> plays, thus preserving time for a Virginia Tech offensive drive. An 11-yard pass by Todd Reesing netted <b>Kansas</b> a first down, however, and subsequent runs by the Jayhawks allowed <b>Kansas</b> to run out the clock despite the Virginia Tech timeouts. <b>Kansas</b> preserved its lead by kneeling on the ball inside the Virginia Tech 5-yard line on the final plays of the game, and the 2421 victory was celebrated as time ran out.|$|E

5|$|<b>Kansas</b> {{received}} Virginia Tech's kickoff, and the Hokies {{attempted to}} give themselves another chance at offense by calling timeouts after <b>Kansas</b> rushed the ball. The timeouts stopped the clock, but <b>Kansas</b> managed {{to earn a}} first down and run out the clock after Tech used its allotted threetimeouts. Heading into halftime, <b>Kansas</b> still had the lead and the momentum, but a Virginia Tech touchdown had cut the Jayhawks' lead to just 10points, 177.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kansas</b> {{took over}} {{at its own}} 12-yard line after the punt. On the first play of the drive, Reesing {{completed}} a 37-yard pass to Dexton Fields, putting the ball near midfield. Three straight incomplete passes later, <b>Kansas</b> faced a fourth-and-ten and a punt. Instead of punting the ball away, however, <b>Kansas</b> elected to try a risky fake punt-pass. Instead of snapping {{the ball to the}} punter, the ball was snapped to running back Brandon McAnderson, who threw the ball 22yards downfield to Micah Brown for a first down. On the very next play, Reesing, having returned to the field, connected on a 28-yard pass to Dexton Fields, who was pushed out of bounds just short of the goal line. With a first-and-goal from inside the one-yard line, a <b>Kansas</b> touchdown seemed inevitable. On the first play inside the red zone, however, <b>Kansas</b> fumbled the ball. Though the ball was recovered by a <b>Kansas</b> player, the play lost fouryards. On the next play, <b>Kansas</b> committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty. The personal foul was followed by a 10-yard holding penalty, and <b>Kansas</b> was pushed entirely outside the Virginia Tech red zone. In an effort to push back, Reesing threw a pass deep downfield. Instead of being completed, however, the ball was intercepted by Virginia Tech's D.J. Parker. With 39seconds left in the quarter, Virginia Tech had stopped <b>Kansas</b> from gaining a point despite the Jayhawks penetrating inside the Virginia Tech one-yard line.|$|E
