5|$|A four-man {{survey party}} from No. 5 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF arrived on Goodenough Island on 3 January 1943.

A member of the survey team and 100 local workers recruited by ANGAU began constructing a jetty at Beli Beli Bay and improving the foot track to Vivigani. An advance party of 54men from No. 5 Mobile Works Squadron arrived on 27 February 1943.|$|E
5|$|A second {{access to}} the castle leads up from a rocky cove, the {{aperture}} to a marine cave on the northern side of the Dunnottar cliffs into which a small boat could be brought. From <b>here</b> <b>a</b> steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff top, which in turn offers {{access to the}} castle via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward. A small sentry box or guard house stands by the eastern battery, overlooking the coast.|$|E

5|$|After Arthur's {{death in}} January 1943, Ninah Cummer began {{collecting}} art in earnest. During the fifteen years before her death, Ninah expanded her art collection to sixty pieces, {{all of which}} are still in the Museum’s collection today. In 1957, the year before her death, Ninah announced that her gifts would “make only a small beginning toward a large vision” and hoped “that others will share this vision and by their interest and contributions will help establish <b>here</b> <b>a</b> center of beauty and culture worthy of the community.” She created the DeEtte Holden Cummer Museum Foundation, named for the deceased infant daughter of the Cummers, to manage her vision after her death.|$|E
5|$|Archaeamphora longicervia H. Q. Li was {{described}} as an herbaceous, Sarraceniaceae-like pitcher plant from the mid Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province, northeastern China. <b>Here,</b> <b>a</b> re-investigation of A. longicervia specimens from the Yixian Formation provides new insights into its identity and the morphology of pitcher plants claimed by Li. We demonstrate that putative pitchers of Archaeamphora are insect-induced leaf galls that consist of three components: (1) an innermost larval chamber; (2) an intermediate zone of nutritive tissue; and (3) an outermost wall of sclerenchyma. Archaeamphora is not a carnivorous, Sarraceniaceae-like angiosperm, but represents insect-galled leaves of the previously reported gymnosperm Liaoningocladus boii G. Sun et al. from the Yixian Formation.|$|E
5|$|Beyond is the Mediterranean Sea and {{the island}} of Cyprus. <b>Here,</b> <b>a</b> {{transition}} in hue is made, from the browns that prevail in {{the lower half of}} the painting to the aquas that saturate the upper half. The Nile River meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia. The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.|$|E

5|$|Boccaccio {{fills in}} the history before the hostage {{exchange}} as follows. Troilus mocks the lovelorn glances of other men who put their trust in women before falling victim to love himself when he sees Cressida, <b>here</b> <b>a</b> young widow, in the Palladium, the temple of Athena. Troilus keeps his love secret and is made miserable by it. Pandarus, Troilus' best friend and Cressida's cousin in {{this version of the}} story, acts as go-between after persuading Troilus to explain his distress. In accordance with the conventions of courtly love, Troilus' love remains secret from all except Pandarus, until Cassandra eventually divines the reason for Troilus' subsequent distress.|$|E

Festive bonfires were usual but risky: a house fire lights the sky in the distance. A link-boy blows on the flame of his torch, street-urchins are playing with the fire, and one of their fireworks is falling in at the coach window.|$|E
5|$|Damping {{occurs at}} two {{different}} scales, {{with the process}} working more quickly over short ranges than over longer distances. <b>Here,</b> <b>a</b> short length {{is one that is}} lower than the mean free path of the photons. A long distance is one that is greater than the mean free path, if still less than the diffusion length. On the smaller scale, perturbations are damped almost instantaneously. On the larger scale, anisotropies are decreased more slowly, with significant degradation happening within one unit of Hubble time.|$|E

The structure of the choral material in this final section complements that of the first section; there a fugal passage was enclosed between two homophonic episodes; <b>here</b> <b>a</b> homophonic episode is preceded and followed by fugal passages. While the first section is preceded by the lengthy orchestral sinfonia, the final section ends with a short coda for full chorus and orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Near Lejjun, {{the remains}} of the ancient {{fortress}} of Megiddo on Tell al Mutesellim dominate the entry to the plain from the Musmus Pass. <b>Here</b> <b>a</b> relatively small garrison could control the routes across the Esdraelon Plain where the armies of Egyptians, Romans, Mongols, Arabs, and Crusaders who had fought Saladin near Afulah during the Battle of Al-Fule, as well as of Napoleon, had marched and fought towards Nazareth, the Galilean Hills, and Damascus.|$|E
5|$|Some protein {{complexes}} {{contain a}} large central cavity that is {{isolated from the}} remainder of the cytosol.

Since these would be damaging if they mixed freely with {{the remainder of the}} cytosol, the barrel is capped by a set of regulatory proteins that recognize proteins with a signal directing them for degradation (a ubiquitin tag) and feed them into the proteolytic cavity.|$|E
