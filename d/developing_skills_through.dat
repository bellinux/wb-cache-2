40|$|Poverty {{alleviation}} {{projects are}} interventions designed {{to assist the}} socio-economic conditions of poor communities. This is a case study on a skills development project that has been implemented {{with the aim of}} alleviating poverty through equipping people with productive skills. The study was conducted in Lephalale, Limpopo province. It was conducted during July and August 2011. The study focuses on skills development as a poverty alleviation strategy because developing skills is essential for building human capacity. The study evaluates the effectiveness of skills development within a community that is characterised by lack of education and skills. Many rural communities fail to apprehend education and skills {{as a result of their}} location and poverty. They are isolated from cities and towns and this has an impact on their surrounding conditions including the level of skills and education. The study found that the skills development project in Lephalale played a vital role of <b>developing</b> <b>skills</b> <b>through</b> training community members with the skills necessary to obtain jobs and be able to create self-employment. Creating self-employment is one way to address the challenges of unemployment and the lack of income. There research found that there are various job opportunities being created in the area, however the local community cannot participate due to lack of skills required in the labour market. The study revealed the majority of the people who joined the skills development project did not complete grade 12 and have never worke...|$|E

The first section describes the geo-political context in the occupied Palestinian territory where most of the on-going rehabilitation plans (Fontana, Amiry) are concentrated. It also highlights the terms reached with the declarations of the Bethlehem Charter, the charter for the safeguarding of Palestinian historic towns and urban landscapes adopted by local administrations in December 2008 (Niglio). The second section illustrates the results of the first phase of work related to the Bethlehem Area Conservation and Management Plan aimed at including the town of Bethlehem on the UNESCO’s World Heritage list. This section presents different methodological and operative aspects of the Plan: the historic landscape in its relation to the context of the urban outskirts (Serrini), the cultural anthropic landscape (Barone), the programme of <b>developing</b> <b>skills</b> <b>through</b> technical cooperation (Palazzo), and the technological tools for urban planning (Gentili). A third section presents a selection of urban regeneration studies, plans and projects, realized and/or in progress within the historic towns of the occupied Palestinian territory: Sabastya (Benelli, Hamdan), East Jerusalem (Touqan), BirZeit (Muhawi), Hebron (Qawasmi, Maraqa), Nablus (Arafat), and Bethlehem (Palazzo, Nasser).

40|$|Guided {{reading is}} used {{frequently}} in reading instruction for young learners {{but it is}} not one of the primary approaches used with deaf and hard of hearing children. Guided reading is an approach that allows teachers to emphasize <b>developing</b> <b>skills</b> <b>through</b> a blend of teaching strategies to ensure successful reading instruction. With limited implementation of and research about guided reading in the field of deaf education, this study provides a view of the possibilities and requirements for this approach with deaf and hard of hearing children. The research design was a case study with a single participant, a classroom teacher working with deaf third graders. Three types of data were gathered: classroom observation notes, interview responses, and lesson plans. Through analysis of nine weeks of classroom observation notes, lesson plans and three interview transcripts, several key elements necessary for guided reading in deaf classrooms emerged: assessments; books; mini-lessons; story-signing; use of visual aids; and English and visual tools. The study revealed that in order for a teacher to implement guided reading successfully with deaf and hard of hearing children, it is essential that the teacher incorporate: a strong assessment plan; selection of appropriate books; appropriate grouping of students; development of effective lesson plans; incorporation of American Sign Language (ASL); and development of effective mini-lessons. This study of the process of the implementation of guided reading in one elementary classroom provides the field of deaf education reasons to explore further how guided reading can support deaf children’s reading development. ...|$|E
40|$|Technology {{education}} as a learning area in Australian schools is relatively new. In 1987, the Australian Education Council {{began a series of}} initiatives that led to the publication in 1994 of nationally agreed curriculum statements and profiles of eight learning areas, one of which was technology. This declaration of technology as a learning area had profound implications. Firstly, all subject areas in secondary schooling from which technology education developed were located within the elective areas of the curriculum. Until this time the implication was that these subjects provided learning experiences relevant only for specific groups of students with particular interests or career destinations in mind. Indeed, some of these subjects were regarded by students and the community as relevant only to a particular gender. Secondly, in the case of primary education, technology had not generally been part of school programs, and primary teachers had little experience to draw on to develop programs. The challenge for technology education was to determine the technology learning experiences that are essential for all students, and are unique to technology education. Prior to the 1990 's school curricula addressed technology in a very limited way through elective or optional syllabuses. Most often students ' experiences of technology were limited to a very restricted range of learning experiences which focused on <b>developing</b> <b>skills</b> <b>through</b> working with materials. The technology classroom activities of today have developed out of these traditions. At the primary school level technology education practices tend to have developed out of art an...|$|E
40|$|Behavioural {{development}} has received little attention in primates, despite having important influences on infant mortality, interbirth intervals, and therefore, growth of populations. Gorillas have long developmental periods, exhibit strong maternal bonds and integrate into intricate social systems, making them an ideal species {{in which to}} investigate non-human primate development. Gorillas exist {{across a range of}} habitats, and differences in behaviour, both within and between species reflect socioecological differences, for example, in the availability and distribution of food. Consequently, by using gorillas as a model, opportunities also exist to investigate environmental constraints on the development of independence. This study provides the first detailed analysis, with reference to ecological factors, of the development of behavioural skills and relationships in wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Behavioural development of western lowland gorillas is then compared with published accounts of development in mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) {{to determine the extent to}} which differing ecology influences behaviour. The study was conducted at Mbeli Bai in the Republic of Congo, a large, marshy clearing, visited by gorillas predominantly for feeding purposes. Data were collected using scan, focal, all-occurrence and ad libitum sampling methods from 58 gorillas below 8 years of age. Spatial relationships, suckling, and the nature of interactions involving immature individuals were analysed. The distribution of time between different behaviours by immatures, and the development of independent feeding and travelling behaviour was also investigated, and all were tested for differences as a result of immature age, sex and social group, or the mother's parity. Towards the end of infancy, individuals showed competent feeding behaviour in the bai. However, western lowland gorillas were not weaned until the juvenile period, and until this time, close association was common between mothers and offspring. With increasing independence from the mother there was limited investment in relationships with other individuals, and instead, a greater emphasis was placed on <b>developing</b> <b>skills</b> <b>through</b> play, alloparenting and agonistic interactions. When results were compared with those of mountain gorillas, there was evidence of increased investment in relationships, particularly with the silverback, by immature mountain gorillas, which was assumed to reflect lower rates of natal dispersal by mountain gorillas, and the greater likelihood that relationships with individuals in the natal group could prove useful in the future. Suckling and close proximity to the mother continued until later ages in western lowland gorillas, resulting in clear differences between them mountain gorillas in the duration of investment by mothers. More frugivorous western lowland gorillas required increased levels of investment by the mother before independence could be achieved, demonstrating the effect that resource availability can have on behavioural development in species where resources are widely and unpredictably dispersed.

40|$|There {{has been}} some {{acknowledgement}} in the published literature that reflection is a crucial element of the evidence based library and information practice (EBLIP) model we have adopted (Booth 2004, 2006; Grant 2007; Helliwell 2007). As we work through a problem and try to incorporate the best available evidence into our decision making, reflection is required at several stages, including the very identification of the problem through to our assessment of the process itself {{and what we have}} learned in order to inform future practice. However, reflection and reflective writing have not fully been integrated into the process we espouse, and very little has been done to look more closely at this element of the model and how it can be integrated into professional learning. In a recently published research article, Sen (2010) confirms the relationship between reflection and several aspects of professional practice. These include critical review and decision making, two aspects that are tied closely to the evidence based process. Sen notes: Students were more likely to show evidence of learning, self‐development, the ability to review issues crucially, awareness of their own mental functions, ability to make decision [sic] and being empowered when they had mastered the art of reflective practice and the more deeply analytical reflective writing. (p. 84) EBLIP (the journal) tries to incorporate elements of reflection within the articles we publish. While we clearly believe in the need for our profession to do quality research and publish that research {{so that it can be}} accessible to practitioners, we also know that research cannot be looked at in isolation. Our evidence summaries are one way of reflecting critically on previously published research, and in the same vein, our classics bring older research studies back to the foreground. This work needs to continue to be discussed and looked at for its impact on our profession. More directly, the Using Evidence in Practice section uses a standardized format enabling practitioners to share their experience of integrating research evidence into their practice. The final section of these brief articles asks the writers to reflect on their experience. Although it is not research, the individual reflection allies with what Schön (1983) called “reflection on action” and such reflections over time form a practical, tacit knowledge that we use to inform our work. Within this section of the journal, we hope readers will become more aware of how different types of evidence can be integrated into real‐world decision making. Not everything requires a full blown research study, and this section allows readers to see what other practitioners are doing, and in turn it should enable them to reflect upon what they are doing in their own practice. Being aware of situations where things may or may not have worked, and reflecting on the reasons why, brings together our sense of critical thought and practical experience that go a long way in filling the “librarian observed” and “professional judgements” parts of the EBLIP definition (Booth and Brice 2004). Acquiring professional knowledge does not end when we complete a graduate program, or have a certain number of years experience under our belts. It needs to be continually and consciously cultivated via reflection on our practice, our research, and simply what works and why. Research knowledge only takes us so far. People often ask me, “What do I do when there is no evidence? Or when the research evidence is weak?” Does this stop us from moving ahead? No. A decision still needs to be made. Evidence based practice is not only about acting when there is good evidence. Enhancing our professional judgments via a career built on analytical reflection, will provide knowledge that goes a long way towards making difficult decisions a little bit easier; even (or perhaps, especially) in the cases when there is already a large body of research evidence. Perhaps EBLIP proponents need to start thinking about the best ways to be reflective practitioners. Could we start a new type of “journal club” where practitioners keep journals as reflective tools, and meet regularly to work through problems and give one another feedback? Or pair up with a reflective partner to have discussions on critical incidents that occurred within our practice? I am sure some people are already doing this, or are finding other mediums such as blogs, wikis, and mailing lists to reflect on elements of practice and engage others who are interested in the topic. However, coming up with concrete strategies for developing reflection within our profession needs to be more widely discussed and articulated. Our professional bodies would be a good starting place, and via these bodies <b>developing</b> <b>skills</b> <b>through</b> continuing professional development. We can learn a lot from other fields such as Education and Nursing, which have more fully incorporated elements of reflection into their practice. We also need to consider the best way to integrate our reflection with available research. I’m sure there are many ideas just waiting to be put into action, or already happening (in which case we would love to hear about them). As with anything worthwhile, there is no simple formula for success, but there is a valuable goal; in this case, improving our practice for the benefit of our patrons and a better understanding of how and why we do what we do as librarians and information professionals...|$|E
