25|$|The green {{political}} movement in Austria had {{originated in the}} aftermath of the 1978 nuclear referendum, with a <b>green</b> <b>list</b> presenting candidates at the 1983 Austrian Federal Election, but it began in earnest {{in the aftermath of}} Hainburg. Up to that point, two main Green {{political movement}}s were in operation - the Alternative List of Austria (ALÖ) and the United Greens of Austria (VGÖ). The parties were disorganized and fractious, and little consensus could be reached between the two for presenting a united political front. After the victory over the Hainburg dam case, a victory for which neither party could legitimately claim credit, efforts were made in 1984 and 1985 to unify the movement and present a single list for the 1987 elections. Yet the attempt worsened ructions, with the VGÖ declining to amalgamate due to the ideological and inter-personal differences, and the ALÖ dividing into two opposing factions.|$|E
