40|$|High {{economical}} efficiency {{obtained by}} utilizing prehardened mould steels in plastic mould making {{has increased the}} usage {{of these types of}} steels to a great extent. Generally, prehardened mould steels are applied for large moulds and moulds for moderate production runs, and {{one of the advantages of}} using this type of steel is that no heat treatment is necessary for putting the mould in use. Today, around 80 percent of the mould steels are produced in prehardened condition which is typically ~ 40 HRC. This <b>hardness</b> <b>limit</b> is required for providing both high hardness and machinability which are of the most important demands upon mould steels. In addition to these properties, a superior polishability, nitriding stability, weldability toughness, corrosion resistance and thermal conductivity are wanted by either moulders or mould makers. Among these properties, machinability is extremely important because of its direct influence on cost of the mould and consequently the plastic part. The machining expenses accounts for more than 60 percent of the total cost of a mould. Hence, improving the machinability in prehardened mould steels has been the concern of tool steel suppliers. In this thesis work, the focus is laid on metallurgical aspects of machinability of prehardened mould steels. Therefore, the machinability of different types of prehardened mould steels is investigated with respect to milling and drilling operations which are the most frequently used machining operations in mould production. In order to understand the metallurgical reason for machinability differences, detailed studies are performed on two steel grades, Uddeholm Nimax and Impax HH. Thorough microstructure characterization is complemented by examining the machinability of the materials in terms of cutting temperature, cutting force and tool life. The materials have shown very different properties in different machining operations and their machinability varies greatly depending on the cutting condition and machining operation type. Comparing the two deeply studied steel grades, Uddeholm Nimax with bainitic structure is benefitted with higher machinability and possesses superior impact toughness and ductility which are important properties for plastic mould steels. Uddeholm Nimax has also the advantage of not needing costly quenching and tempering processes for its production...|$|E

40|$|Published online: 25 April 2016 Hydrogen-assisted cold {{cracking}} is generally accepted {{to be the}} consequence of a critical concentration of hydrogen trapped within a susceptible microstructure and subjected to a threshold level of stress. Traditionally, hardness {{has been used as}} a proxy for establishing the critical limits above which the risk of a hydrogen crack propagating is considered significant. However, developments in the steel-making process, in particular thermomechanically controlled processing, has brought into question the suitability of empirical <b>hardness</b> <b>limits</b> developed using older generation steels. In this paper, a safe welding boundary was established for single-pass root runs for API 5 L X 70 steel welded with E 6010 electrodes. Across this boundary, it was shown that hydrogen cracks were present in welds with hardness’s well below the traditionally accepted threshold of 350 HV. This paper explores the use of nanoindentation as means of quantifying the susceptibility of welds deposited on high-strength low-alloy steels, using shielded metal arc welding, to hydrogen-assisted {{cold cracking}}. It is suggested that the use of the hardness/elastic modulus (H/E) ratio, which is directly related to the yield strength of a material, is a more suitable parameter to predict weld metal hydrogen-assisted cold cracking (HACC) susceptibility than is the hardness alone.

40|$|The {{application}} of duplex stainless steels in various {{applications such as}} in petrochemical, water desalination and paper milling industries has rapidly increased in recent years, {{taking advantage of the}} combination of high strength and good corrosion resistance from the dual phase stainless steels. However, having low wear resistance and low surface <b>hardness</b> <b>limits</b> the applicability of the steels for wider applications; thus, improvement of the features is essential. A thermochemical hybrid treatment process has been developed to improve the wear resistance and surface hardness of duplex stainless steels without compromising its corrosion resistance. The process was performed by using a mixture of methane (CH 4), ammonia(NH 3) and nitrogen (N 2) at low temperature of below 500 °C. The process simultaneously introduces the alloying elements of carbon and nitrogen into the surface of the duplex stainless steels forming a precipitation free layer along with improvement of wear resistance and surface hardness. This study discusses the influence of the process parameters such as temperature, holding time and gas composition used during the process towards the structural development and morphology of the layer as well as the effects of precipitation on the chromium element. It was found that the nitrogen and carbon diffused at the layer producing expanded austenite phase and expanded ferrite phase of a complex combination of YN, yc, GIN and ao The expanded phases increased the surface hardness up to five times, improvised the wear resistance of the treated samples. However, traces of precipitation of chromium were detected in sample treated at prolonged 30 hours of holding time and for the sample treated for a temperature of 500 °C, indicating the limit of the process parameter used to produce the precipitation free expanded phases. It can be concluded that the improvement on the surface hardness and wear resistance of duplex stainless steel can be achieved by the formation of expanded phases at the layer by controlling the main parameters during the thermochemical proces...|$|R

The adoption of new high strength, modified 2 % Cr steels can be an option, provided that these will perform for the required component life. Challenges have arisen when using new high strength T/P 23 and T/P 24 steels for waterwalls, superheaters and steam lines. This paper reviews the recent understanding of the applicability and limitations of these steels in welded components. A range of causative reasons are proposed for the not entirely successful application of the P/T 23 and P/T 24 particularly in waterwalls and steam lines. The complexity of optimising weld properties is demonstrated in view of unforgiving material response especially at weld defects, {{as well as of}} high weldment <b>hardness</b> and <b>limited</b> ductility. Selection of filler metal type and composition is elucidated with respect to propensity to low weld metal ductility, such as low creep ductility damage or reheat cracking. The role of structural rigidity and actual constraint conditions in real components is discussed, as it comes to adopting filler metals with the aim of either increasing weld creep strength or ensuring adequate creep ductility, as well as to whether to conduct or omit the subsequent PWHT. One of the most persistent remaining challenging issues concerns welded thick-wall applications for high temperature headers, steam pipes or turbines, where the weld metal tends to show very limited creep ductility. More recently, setbacks have been seen in the attempts to use T 24 in welded water walls of large boiler plants.

To be that with any approach to perfection demands an intricate and difficult effort, introspection to the hilt of one's power, a saving natural gift; one has to avoid pedantry, aggression, brutality, amiable tiresomeness--there are pitfalls on every side. The more one thinks about other people the more interesting and pleasing they are; I am all for kindly gossip and knowing things about them, and all against the silly and <b>limiting</b> <b>hardness</b> of soul that will not look into one's fellows nor go out to them. The use and justification of most literature, of fiction, verse, history, biography, is that it lets us into understandings and the suggestion of human possibilities. The general purpose of intercourse is to get as close as one can to the realities of the people one meets, and to give oneself to them just so far as possible.|$|R
40|$|With the {{widespread}} use of geo-positioning services (GPS), GPS-based navigation systems have become ever more of an integral part of our daily lives. GPS-based navigation systems usually suggest multiple paths for any given pair of source and target, leaving users perplexed when trying to select the best one among them, namely the problem of best path selection. Too many suggested paths may jeopardize the usability of the recommendation data, and decrease user satisfaction. Although existing studies have already partially relieved this problem through integrating historical traffic logs or updating traffic conditions periodically, their solutions neglect the potential contribution of human experience. In this paper, we resort to crowdsourcing to ease the pain of the best path selection. The first step of appropriately using the crowd is to ask proper questions. For the best path selection problem, simple questions (e. g. binary voting) over compete paths cannot be directly applied to road networks due to their being too complex for crowd workers. Thus, this paper makes the first contribution by designing two types of questions, namely Routing Query (RQ) and Binary Routing Query (BRQ), to ask the crowd to decide which direction to take at each road intersection. Furthermore, we propose a series of efficient algorithms to dynamically manage the questions {{in order to reduce the}} selection <b>hardness</b> within a <b>limited</b> budget. Finally, we compare the proposed methods against two baselines, and the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposals are verified by the results from simulations and experiments on a real-world crowdsourcing platform...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical food {{properties}} {{influence the}} neuromuscular activity of jaw-closing muscles during mastication. It is, however, unknown how the activity {{profiles of the}} jaw muscles are influenced by long-term alterations in masticatory load. In order to elucidate the effect of reduced masticatory load on the daily habitual activity profiles of three functionally different jaw muscles, the electromyograms of the masseter, temporalis and digastric muscles were recorded telemetrically in 16 male rabbits between seven and 20 weeks of age. Starting at eight weeks of age the experimental animals were fed significantly softer pellets than the control animals. Daily muscle activity was quantified by the relative duration of muscle use (duty time), burst number and burst length in relation to multiple activity levels. The daily duty time and burst number of the masseter muscle were significantly lower {{in the experimental group}} than in the control group at 5 % and 10 % of the maximum activity during the two weeks following the change in food hardness. By contrast, altered food hardness did not significantly influence the activity characteristics of the temporalis and digastric muscles. The findings suggest that a reduction in masticatory load decreases the neuromuscular activity of the jaw-closing muscles that are primarily responsible for force generation during mastication. This decrease is most pronounced in the weeks immediately following the change in food <b>hardness</b> and is <b>limited</b> to the activity levels that reflect muscle contractions during chewing. These findings support the conclusion that the masticatory system manifests few diet-specific long-term changes in the activity profiles of jaw muscles...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{performed}} at Scania CV AB and aimed {{to optimize the}} effect of shot peening {{in order to increase}} the bending fatigue limit of planetary gears. In this project three parameters affecting the performance of the shot peening were examined in more detail, specifically the hardness of the shot peening media, the hardness of the material and the amount retained austenite. Shot peening and measurements were performed on carburized gears consisting of ss 92506 steel. In order to find out how the fatigue limit is affected by the material hardness, a number of gears were tempered whereas other remained untempered. Similarly the retained austenite content was altered in some of the gears with a cryotreatment. The shot peening of these gears {{was performed}} by dual shot peening using media of two different <b>hardness.</b> The fatigue <b>limit</b> was evaluated by a servo hydraulic material testing machine. The results show that the fatigue limit is enhanced when the shot peening was performed with hard media. This was expected since the harder media can cause larger plastic deformation in the material giving rise to larger compressive residual stresses which is known to increase the fatigue limit. The fatigue limit was also improved for samples with lower surface hardness. The amount of retained austenite does not seem to affect the fatigue limit for samples shot peened with media of sufficient hardness in order to cause adequate plastic deformation. The surface roughness remained unchanged for samples shot peened by different media, which indicates that this parameter should not hinder a change of media...|$|R
40|$|Metoprolol {{tartrate}} {{is effective}} β-blocker which is having antianginal properties {{and used in}} the treatment of myocardial infarction. Oral bioavailability of metoprolol tartrate is around 40 %. In present work an attempt has been made to prepare fast dissolving tablets of metoprolol tartrate to enhance the dissolution rate. Sublimation method was used to prepare the fast dissolving tablets by using different concentrations of superdisintegrants like indion- 414, crospovidone, sodium starch glycolate, croscarmellose sodium. The blend was examined for the pre-compressional parameters and post-compressional parameters. Drug compatibility with excipients was checked by FTIR and DSC studies. The values of pre-compression parameters evaluated were within prescribed limits and indicated good free flowing property. In all the formulations, friability is less than 1 %, indicated that tablets had a good mechanical resistance. Drug content was found to be in the range of 99 to 101 %, which is within acceptable <b>limits.</b> <b>Hardness</b> of the tablets was found to be in the range of 2. 00 - 2. 90 kg/cm 2. The formulations F 1, F 8, F 9 shows less in vitro dispersion time 18, 25, 19 sec respectively with rapid in vitro dissolution within 5 min. In vitro dispersion time decreases with increase in concentration of indion 414 upto 3 % then dispersion time increases. Where as in vitro dispersion time decreases with increase in the concentration of croscarmellose sodium. No chemical interaction between drug and excipients was confirmed by DSC and FTIR studies. The stability study conducted as per the ICH guidelines and the formulations were found to be stable. The results concluded that fast dissolving tablets of metoprolol tartrate showing enhanced dissolution will lead to improved bioavailability and effective therapy by using sublimation method...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{are often the}} main topic, but at least a necessary precondition {{in the application of}} thin films. The indentation methods with monitoring of load and penetrating depth yield local stress-strain curves. Devices are now available with depth resolution down to the manometer range. They are very valuable tools for mechanical characterization for many film systems. But the indentation methods have some intrinsic limitations. Apart from such problems as uncertainties of the tip shape and influence of surface roughness, there are two classes of thin films, which are especially critical: ultra-hard and ultra-thin films. For ultra-hard films (with Vickers hardness HV > 50 GPa) the deformabilities of indenter and film become comparable. For ultra-thin films (with thickness below 100 nm) the plastic zone induced even by very shallow indentations is usually not restricted on the film material but reaches into the underlying substrate. Thus the measured values represent a certain average of the film-substrate composite, where the film properties cannot extracted from in a reliable manner due to the high complexity and non-linearity of the indentation test. The film characterization by Young's modulus determined by surface ultrasonic waves helps to overcome these problems. The laser-acoustic method has proved to be very suitable as reliable, quick and robust technique for testing thin films. The surface acoustic wave method is based on linear-elastic phenomena. Hence, even for deformation fields reaching deep into the substrate, the film properties may be deciphered by strong mathematics. Furthermore, high film <b>hardness</b> is not <b>limiting.</b> (There is only another unavoidable restriction: the attenuation of the substrate material for the high frequency ultrasonic surface waves must be sufficient low.) The measuring method and some representative results are given in chapter 3 and 4, respectively. But at first the basic question must be discussed, if the Young's modulus is suitable for mechanical characterization at all...|$|R
