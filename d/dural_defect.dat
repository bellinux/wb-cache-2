40|$|Idiopathic {{spinal cord}} {{herniation}} (ISCH) is a rare, although increasingly recognized, cause of myelopathy. It {{is the result}} of an anterior <b>dural</b> <b>defect</b> in the thoracic spine through which the spinal cord herniates. Surgical restoration of the herniated cord to its normal position is usually followed by significant improvement in patients' clinical status. Differing surgical techniques have been used to manage the <b>dural</b> <b>defect.</b> In this report the authors discuss the cases of five patients (four women and one man) with ISCH treated during a 13 -year period. Clinical and imaging findings in each patient are reported. Two different surgical techniques were used to treat this condition: <b>dural</b> <b>defect</b> enlargement in two cases and dural patch secured with stitches in three. The intra- and postoperative findings are discussed in relation to the two surgical techniques. Based on the results and complications in these five cases, the authors now believe that ISCH should be treated, when feasible, by using a dural patch to close the <b>dural</b> <b>defect</b> {{at the site of the}} herniation...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} {{treatment for}} symptomatic spinal extradural arachnoid cyst (SEAC) is complete surgical removal of cyst and {{closure of the}} <b>dural</b> <b>defect.</b> In most cases, total laminectomy has been performed at affected vertebra for complete removal of the SEAC.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundBecause of {{the lack}} of {{long-term}} postoperative follow-up studies of idiopathic spinal cord herniation (ISCH), there is little information about the long-term effectiveness and complications of the <b>dural</b> <b>defect</b> enlargement in patients with ISCH. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the long-term effectiveness of this procedure. MethodsSixteen patients with ISCH were treated surgically by enlargement of the <b>dural</b> <b>defect.</b> The patient's neurological status and surgical outcome were evaluated by the JOA scores for thoracic myelopathy and the recovery rate (mean follow-up period 9. 6 years). Correlations between the surgical outcomes and patients' age and duration of disease were assessed retrospectively. The patients were also divided into two groups based on the location of the dural defect: the ventro-lateral (VL) group and the ventral (V) group. The difference in the duration of disease, preoperative JOA score, and the recovery rate were compared between the two groups. ResultsThere was no recurrence of ISCH after surgery. The mean recovery rate was 42. 6 %. There was a significant correlation between the patient's age and the recovery rate, and between the duration of disease and the recovery rate. The median recovery rate was significantly lower in the V group than in the VL group. There were no complications related to CSF leakage after surgery. ConclusionsLong-term surgical outcomes of enlargement of the <b>dural</b> <b>defect</b> for ISCH were stable and favorable without recurrences or any complications. This procedure should be considered for patients with ISCH before their neurological deficit worsens, especially for the patients in whom the <b>dural</b> <b>defect</b> is located at the ventral part of the dural canal...|$|E
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONSpontaneous {{intracranial}} hypotension (SIH) is {{an uncommon}} syndrome widely attributed to CSF hypovolemia, typically secondary to spontaneous CSF leak. Although {{commonly associated with}} postural headache and variable neurological symptoms, {{one of the most}} severe consequences of SIH is bilateral subdural hematomas with resultant neurological deterioration. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe present the case of a patient diagnosed with SIH secondary to an anteriorly positioned thoracic osteophyte with resultant dural disruption, who after multiple attempts at nonsurgical management developed bilateral subdural hematomas necessitating emergent surgical intervention. The patient underwent a unilateral posterior repair of his osteophyte with successful anterior decompression. At 36 months follow up, the patient reported completely resolved headaches with no focal neurological deficits. DISCUSSIONWe outline our posterior approach to repair of the <b>dural</b> <b>defect</b> and review the management algorithm for the treatment of patients with SIH. We also examine the current hypotheses as to the origin, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome. CONCLUSIONA posterior approach was utilized to repair the <b>dural</b> <b>defect</b> caused by an anterior thoracic osteophyte in a patient with severe SIH complicated by bilateral subdural hematomas. This approach minimizes morbidity compared to an anterior approach and allowed for removal of the osteophyte and repair of the <b>dural</b> <b>defect...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were (a) to construct an in vitro model of rabbit dural healing, (b) to test the influence of collagen, laminin, and poly-L-lysine on the migration and proliferation of dural cells, and (c) to study the healing mechanism of duraplasty. Rabbit dural pieces (1. 5 cm x 1. 5 cm) were perforated in their central part with a 2 mm punch to mimic a <b>dural</b> <b>defect.</b> The dural pieces were cultured in 24 -well plates that had been coated with collagen, laminin, or poly-L-lysine, and the influence of different extracellular matrices on migration and proliferation of dural cells was observed. Cells were subcultured on slides for immunocytochemistry to study their characteristics; dural healing was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The results demonstrated that only the dural pieces that were cultured on collagen-coated wells showed migration of cells into the central defect after a period of 8 to 10 days and that healing of the <b>dural</b> <b>defect</b> occurred by 13 to 15 days. The cultured dural cells stained strongly positive with an antibody to vimentin, but negative with an antibody to factor VIII. New collagen fibers were observed in the dural defects.

40|$|As {{endoscopic}} {{skull base}} resections have advanced, appropriate reconstruction has become paramount. The reconstructive {{options for the}} skull base include both avascular and vascular grafts. We review these and provide an algorithm for endoscopic skull base reconstruction. One hundred and sixty-six skull base <b>dural</b> <b>defects,</b> reconstructed with an endonasal vascular flap, were examined. As an adjunct, avascular reconstruction techniques are discussed to illustrate all options for endonasal skull base reconstruction. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak rates are also discussed. Small CSF leaks may be successfully repaired with various avascular grafting techniques. Endoscopic endonasal approaches (EEAs) to the skull base often have larger <b>dural</b> <b>defects</b> with high-flow CSF leaks. Success rates for some EEA procedures utilizing avascular grafts approach 90 %, yet in high-flow leak situations, success rates are much lower (50 to 70 %). Defect location and complexity guides vascularized flap choice. When nasoseptal flaps are unavailable, anterior/sellar defects are best managed with an endoscopically harvested pericranial flap, whereas clival/posterior defects may be reconstructed with an inferior turbinate or temporoparietal flap. An endonasal skull base reconstruction algorithm was constructed and points to increased use of various vascularized reconstructions for more complex skull base defects...|$|R
40|$|CSF leak {{still is}} one of the major sources of {{morbidity}} after extensive skull base procedures. Of the various standard closure techniques of traumatic or iatrogenic <b>dural</b> <b>defects,</b> none provides a really waterlight, persistent closure. Even the supplementary use of fluid fibrin glue did not substantially improve the rate of postoperative CSF leaks. The application of a collagen sheet covered with a fixed layer of solid components of a fibrin tissue glue (TachoComb®) overcomes the major drawbacks of dural sealing in skull base surgery. The <b>dural</b> <b>defects</b> of 58 patients undergoing extensive skull base procedures were sealed with this new hemostyptic agent.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of extended endoscopic cranial base surgery, postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak has been a formidable and troublesome issue resulting in complications such meningitis, pneumocephalus, {{and the need for}} additional surgical interventions. Establishment of a watertight cranial base reconstruction is the most critical step in preventing postoperative CSF leakage. Historically, various free grafts, both synthetic and autologous, were utilized as repair materials for reconstruction of the cranial base defect often in combination with temporary CSF diversion. Free grafts are often sufficient for repair of small low flow, low pressure <b>dural</b> <b>defects.</b> High postoperative CSF leak rates reported in the initial endoscopic skull base literature are evidence that free grafts do not provide a reliably competent repair for large defects or direct high-flow CSF leaks.

40|$|Background: In {{patients}} with large <b>dural</b> <b>defects</b> of the anterior and ventral skull base after endo-nasal skull base surgery, {{there is a}} significant risk of a postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak after re-construction. Reconstruction with vascularized tis-sue is desirable to facilitate rapid healing, espe-cially in irradiated patients. Methods:We developed a neurovascular pedicled flap of the nasal septum mucoperiosteum and mucoperichondrium based on the nasoseptal artery, a branch of the posterior sep-tal artery (Hadad-Bassagasteguy flap [HBF]). A ret-rospective review of patients undergoing endonasal skull base surgery at the University of Rosario, Ar-gentina, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center was performed to identify patients who were reconstructed with a vascularized septal mu-cosal flap. Results: Forty-three patients undergoing endonasal cranial base surgery were repaired with the septal mucosal flap. Two {{patients with}} postop-erative cerebrospinal fluid leaks (5 %) were success-fully treated with focal fat grafts. We encountered no infectious or wound complications in this series of patients. One patient experienced a posterior nose bleed from the posterior nasal artery. This was controlled with electrocautery and the flap blood supply was preserved. Conclusion: The HBF is a versatile and reliable reconstructive technique for defects of the anterior, middle, clival, and parasel-lar skull base. Its use has resulted in a sharp de-crease in the incidence of postoperative cerebrospi-nal fluid leaks after endonasal skull base surgery and is recommended for the reconstruction of large <b>dural</b> <b>defects</b> and when postoperative radiation therapy is anticipated.

40|$|XTIRPATION {{of large}} {{intracranial}} tumors frequently re-quires excision of the dura mater overlying the tu-mor. In such cases, primary {{closure of the}} dura is in-adequate, and dural reconstruction requires placement of a fascial patch over the excised area to form a watertight seal. In skull base procedures, the aim of reconstruction {{is to provide a}} barrier between the contaminated nasosinusoidal space and the sterile subdural compartment, thus preventing any CSF leak or airflow into the intracranial space. To avoid these complications, the dura must be closed quickly with a type of closure that supports instant CSF pressure and with-stands considerable shearing forces during the postopera-tive period. Conventional repair of large <b>dural</b> <b>defects</b> includes fascial grafts, which are sutured to the edges of the intact dura ma-ter. Suture repair is not completely watertight, however, and CSF leakage through gaps between the sutures and through holes created by the needle is not uncommon. Moreover, the reconstructed dura is at increased risk for tears and breaks during the immediate postoperative period (especially in el-derly persons or following radiotherapy). Laser tissue soldering is a relatively new technique for the binding of biological tissues by means of a laser beam. 1 It has been used for the repair of bladder and ureter defects 7, 9 and for placement of nerve grafts. 8 In two earlier studies a conventional laser approach was used for primary dural clo-sure, 2, 6 but dural soldering alone offered no advantage over conventional methods.

There {{was no significant difference between}} AFL and DHD grafts. In conclusion, it seems that DHD is suitable as an ideal dural graft, because the immune response of host to DHD was almost similar to AFL...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{a case of}} 28 -year-old man who presented with cervical myelopathy and lumbar radiculopathy due to the giant cervical pseudomeningocele extending to the lumbar spine at 10  years after previous brachial plexus injury. To evaluate the communicating tract between pseudomeningocele and subarachnoidal space, the multidetector-row helical CT with simultaneous myelography was performed preoperatively. The surgical treatment in the cervical spine included the resection of pseudomeningocele and the repair of <b>dural</b> <b>defects</b> communicating into the cyst following multi-level laminoplasty and foraminotomies. At 6  years after surgery, the significant neurologic recovery and complete obliteration of cysts in the whole spine area were maintained. This serves as the first report describing the significant neurologic recovery after the surgical treatment of giant cervical pseudomeningocele extending to the lumbar spine after previous brachial plexus injury...|$|R
40|$|BJECT: Human {{dura mater}} {{is the most}} {{external}} meningeal sheet surrounding the CNS. It provides an efficient protection to intracranial structures and represents the most important site for CSF turnover. Its intrinsic architecture {{is made up of}} fibrous tissue including collagenic and elastic fibers that guarantee the maintenance of its biophysical features. The recent technical advances in the repair of <b>dural</b> <b>defects</b> have allowed for the creation of many synthetic and biological grafts. However, no detailed studies on the 3 D microscopic disposition of collagenic fibers in dura mater are available. The authors report on the collagenic 3 D architecture of normal dura mater highlighting the orientation, disposition in 3 dimensions, and shape of the collagen fibers with respect to the observed layer. METHODS: Thirty-two dura mater specimens were collected during cranial decompressive surgical procedures, fixed in 2. 5...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} a {{material}} to be utilized as dural substitute has been a continuous one {{for the last six}} decades. Many materials have been tried, including the different metals, various biological tissues, and plant derivatives. Recently, synthetic products have been utilized as dural substitute. Among these, Vinyon "N " (Teng and Feigin, 1955), Teflon (Teng, unpublished data), and Orlon * (Huertas, 1955) have shown the most promising results, producing only minimal tissue reaction when buried intracranially in experimental animals. Since publication of the results obtained in experi-mental monkeys, Vinyon "N " has been used in 40 clinical cases with various neurosurgical conditions, which included its use as (1) dural substitute in repairs of <b>dural</b> <b>defects</b> produced by surgery, trauma, or tumour; (2) bone lining, in the pre-vention of bone reunion in craniostenosis; and (3) nerve wrap after neurolysis in cicatrization (Table I) ...|$|R
