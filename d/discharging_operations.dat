Moreover, since the number of times the batteries can be cycled is limited, and overly frequent charging and discharging may reduce the life span of batteries, the power allocation to an HESS is especially important. In view of this, ultra-capacitors have an important role in buffering the frequent fluctuating component of P hess, based on their high power density, fast response and long cycle life. At the same time, batteries handle the more slowly varying component of P hess and avoid frequent charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>operations,</b> using their large capacity and providing the more economical form of energy storage.|$|E

The basic principle of the CDCVC-based harmonics compensation strategy under nonlinear load conditions is discussed in detail. The instantaneous power flowing into the three-leg pulse-width modulated (PWM) rectifier, which performs as a smart charger, shows that the CDCVC-based strategy achieves balanced and sinusoidal source currents with a unity power factor. The CDCVC-based harmonics compensation strategy does not require any calculation blocks of fundamental reactive, unbalanced active, and harmonic currents. Thus, the authors propose a simplified algorithm to compensate for reactive, unbalanced active, and harmonic currents. A digital computer simulation is implemented to confirm the validity and high practicability of the CDCVC-based harmonics compensation strategy using PSIM software. Simulation results demonstrate that balanced and sinusoidal source currents with a unity power factor in SPTWDFs are obtained on the secondary side of the pole-mounted distribution transformer (PMDT) during both the battery-charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>operations</b> in EVs, compensating for the reactive, unbalanced active, and harmonic currents...|$|E

40|$|Power {{grid and}} market {{integration}} of wind energy {{is a challenge}} due to the fluctuating and intermittent power output resulting from the variable nature of wind resource. Energy storage is a promising alternative for effective grid integration of renewable energy.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{amount of}} cargo transported by container vessels require port terminals to have efficient cargo handling. A port terminal needs to be efficient {{in order to attract}} and keep customers, hence the productivity in the terminal is important.

This thesis investigates what factors a crane operator experiences as difficult and time consuming during cargo operations. The results are that obstructed view are considered as the major issue. The crane operators need to operate behind stacks of containers on board, referred to as Manhattan Stowage. Crane operators consider this as a factor lowering the crane productivity. This is strengthened by the vessel planners who agree and according to them, this issue can be dealt with by taking this into consideration when making the stowage plan at the shipping line. If crane operators can work with unobstructed view, the crane productivity would increase and loading Layer-by-Layer would be an alternative. However, the interviewed shipping line argued that doing so will have negative consequences as a result which makes it not likely to implement. Alternative solutions could be to leave an empty row behind the stack to help the crane operators since they agree on leaving an empty row would give them better conditions...|$|E

Due to the problem of posible shortage of energy resources, cost or enviromental cosiderations, a power saving and energy efficient devices become frequent request and important need. Therefore, within this apaer a single phase battery charger / discharger set is proposed, which operates in two different modes. An empty battery is charged directly from ac source through the control of a PWM rectifier converter, followed by a dc/dc buck regulator in the first mode, which is called charging mode. Second mode is discharging mode, as the set is utilized to discharge and transfer the energy from a charged battery to charge another empty battery, hence a power saving has been obtained. Such charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>operations</b> could be frequently required, particularly during batteries manufacturing, tests, maintenance and also can be adopted to be utilized withn recent vechicle to grid applications.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{fundamentally}} {{relevant to the}} development of a new enhanced Roller Track Gate (RTG) for the gravity type Self-unloading Bulk Carriers (SULS), called the Multi-functional Roller Track Gate (MRG). Self-unloading Bulk Carriers (SULS) are specialized types of dry bulk carrier vessels, principally because these ships discharge their cargoes without the assistance of external sources. In 1908, the first commercial vessel of these types started trading in the Great Lakes region of North America. Subsequent to the inception of SULS, the technology has developed mainly in the hull structure and onboard unloading systems. Due to the 1980 s GL shipping recession, SULS migrated internationally and are now trading worldwide. Eight gravity gates for SULS were investigated in detail prior to designing the MRG. These examinations of previous gates were primarily to address the inherent issues and develop a new gate that would correct the current problems, when discharging dry bulk cargo with the existing gravity gates. The newly designed gate is accompanied with special control system that improves the <b>discharging</b> <b>operations</b> of these type vessels. This gate resulted in being heavier when compared to the existing RTG. However, this study also addresses and mitigates the associated improvements in this new type gate that increases the ship’s lightweight with the possibility of increasing payload / deadweight. High tensile steel was introduced for the hull to compensate for the added gate weight. The steel weight reduction investigation resulted in greater weight than what was required for offsetting the gate weight. The additional weight savings allowed for greater cargo lift for the vessels examined. The economic case study confirmed that by replacing the present Roller Track Gate with the Multi-functional Roller Track Gate, the shipowners’ would benefit from improve discharging performance, less port turn around time and reduced manning cost.

40|$|The {{continuous}} development of Electricity Storage Systems (ESS) technologies {{has made them}} interesting choices in the utility scale electricity market. Renewable sources intermittency, load management and power quality are the major purposes of ESS investment in grids. Their primary goal is to technically find the best solution for those problems, while the economic profits pass through that. However, in the increasingly competitive market environments, ESS would possibly {{be able to be}} operated simply to maximise profits for the investor, without aiming in a specific technical problem solution. In that sense, ESS follow the simple guideline oftrading wholesale electricity; purchasing cheap and selling expensive electricity. Another characteristic of today's electricity markets is that the load pattern becomes more erratic, having higher peaks and the load factor ofthe generation and grid falls. Utilities use Demand-Side Management (DSM) to control the demand. One of the features of this control is the peak shaving and shifting of load to off-peak hours. This research optimises the operation ofESS; it identifies the best combination ofcharging and <b>discharging</b> <b>operations</b> (duration and timing within a management period) aiming in maximisation of profits, in two options of management periods; one-day and three-day. Three very important elements of the analysis is the extent in which the profitability ofESS is affected by the existence ofDSM programmes in the market, whether the ESS can be granted with emissions allowances and up to which installed capacity of ESS in the electricity network the profits are positive. For this purpose, a dynamic optimisation model has been built, which incorporates a deterministic model as a real case of application with specific values of parameters. The dynamic modelling assesses the point where the investments in power capacity of ESS show their maximum achieved profits per installed MW, in combinations of four main options: DSM, NoDSM, 24 h and 72 h management period. The deterministic model aims at the optimisation ofthe allocation ofthe charge and discharge operations, simulating a real situation with specific data and parameters. The results show that DSM programmes can have substantial impacts on net revenues and profits achieved by ESS, but not such, on variable costs and revenues. Profitability falls and amongst the storage technologies tested, only those with high electrical round trip efficiency and low replacement costs can be viable investment options. So, the extent of DSM application in the market can influence storage profitability in a variable way. High capital costs and low efficiencies are the first factors to work prohibitively, alongside with DSM, to the profitability ofESS. Investigation of extending the management period from one to three days, has given higher net revenues with relatively smaller increase of discharged electricity. The indirect emissions d'le to the charging operation of the ESS depend on the primary source of energy used to generate the electricity which was stored and therefore, the ESS cannot be granted of emissions allowances in the way they are considered in this research. However, if there are bilateral trading agreements between renewable energy generators and the operators of the ESS, then the avoided emissions of ESS would be positive and the profitability would grow from the participation in the ETS. In the case that the regulations could recognise some economic benefits for ESS (like they do for renewable sources) they could stand more easily and quickly in the competitive electricity market. Funding opportunities for covering the capital cost and special rates for selling electricity to the network and for providing ancillary services can be some of them.
