5|$|Louis {{was born}} as Ludwig Alexander von Battenberg in Graz, Styria, {{the eldest son}} of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine by his morganatic {{marriage}} to Countess Julia von Hauke. Because of his morganatic parentage, Louis was denied his father's rank in the Grand Duchy of Hesse; and, from birth, his style of Illustrious <b>Highness</b> and title of Count of Battenberg instead derived from the rank given to his mother {{at the time of}} her marriage. On 26 December 1858, he automatically became His Serene <b>Highness</b> Prince Louis of Battenberg when his mother was elevated to Princess of Battenberg with the style of Serene <b>Highness,</b> by decree of her husband's brother, Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} however has to {{be considered}} {{on the basis of}} the fact that, for reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal <b>Highness</b> on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it seems clear that the wife of a Royal <b>Highness</b> enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.|$|E

5|$|The {{denial of}} the style Royal <b>Highness</b> to the Duchess of Windsor caused further conflict, as did the {{financial}} settlement. The Government declined to include the Duke or Duchess on the Civil List, and the Duke's allowance was paid personally by George VI. The Duke compromised his position with his brother by concealing {{the extent of his}} financial worth when they informally agreed on the amount of the allowance. Edward's wealth had accumulated from the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall paid to him as Prince of Wales and ordinarily at the disposal of an incoming king. George VI also paid Edward for Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle, which were Edward's personal property, inherited from his father, George V, and thus did not automatically pass to George VI on his accession. In the early days of George VI's reign the Duke telephoned daily, importuning for money and urging that the Duchess be granted the style of Royal <b>Highness,</b> until the harassed king ordered that the calls not be put through.|$|E

5|$|We incline to {{the view}} that on his abdication the Duke of Windsor could not have claimed the right to be {{described}} as a Royal <b>Highness.</b> In other words, no reasonable objection could have been taken if the King had decided that his exclusion from the lineal succession excluded him from the right to this title as conferred by the existing Letters Patent.|$|E
