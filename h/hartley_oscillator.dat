50|$|In America, the {{configuration}} was different. Grid 1 acted as the oscillator grid as before, {{but in this}} case, grids 2 and 4 were connected together (again usually internally).

Grid 4 screened this from the anode, and grid 5 was a suppressor grid to suppress secondary emission. This configuration limited the oscillator design to one where the oscillator 'anode' was operated from the HT+ (B+) rail.

50|$|The <b>Hartley</b> <b>{{oscillator}}</b> is {{the dual}} of the Colpitts oscillator {{which uses a}} voltage divider made of two capacitors rather than two inductors. Although there is no requirement {{for there to be}} mutual coupling between the two coil segments, the circuit is usually implemented using a tapped coil, with the feedback taken from the tap, as shown here. The optimal tapping point (or ratio of coil inductances) depends on the amplifying device used, which may be a bipolar junction transistor, FET, triode, or amplifier of almost any type (non-inverting in this case, although variations of the circuit with an earthed centre-point and feedback from an inverting amplifier or the collector/drain of a transistor are also common), but a junction FET (shown) or triode is often employed as a good degree of amplitude stability (and thus distortion reduction) can be achieved with a simple grid leak resistor-capacitor combination in series with the gate or grid (see the Scott circuit below) thanks to diode conduction on signal peaks building up enough negative bias to limit amplification.|$|E
50|$|In electronics, {{a center}} tap (CT) is a contact {{made to a}} point halfway along a winding of a {{transformer}} or inductor, or along the element of a resistor or a potentiometer.Taps are sometimes used on inductors for the coupling of signals, and {{may not necessarily be}} at the half-way point, but rather, closer to one end. A common application of this is in the <b>Hartley</b> <b>oscillator.</b> Inductors with taps also permit the transformation of the amplitude of alternating current (AC) voltages for the purpose of power conversion, in which case, they are referred to as autotransformers, since there is only one winding. An example of an autotransformer is an automobile ignition coil. Potentiometer tapping provides one or more connections along the device's element, along with the usual connections at each of the two ends of the element, and the slider connection. Potentiometer taps allow for circuit functions that would otherwise not be available with the usual construction of just the two end connections and one slider connection.|$|E
50|$|The {{oscillator}} circuit {{is responsible}} for creating the elevated frequency electric current, which when applied to the work coil creates the magnetic field which heats the part. The basic elements of the circuit are an inductance (tank coil) and a capacitance (tank capacitor) and an oscillator valve. Basic electrical principles dictate that if a voltage is applied to a circuit containing a capacitor and inductor the circuit will oscillate {{in much the same}} way as a swing which has been pushed. Using our swing as an analogy if we do not push again at the right time the swing will gradually stop this is the same with the oscillator. The purpose of the valve is to act as a switch which will allow energy to pass into the oscillator at the correct time to maintain the oscillations. In order to time the switching, a small amount of energy is fed back to the grid of the triode effectively blocking or firing the device or allow it to conduct at the correct time. This so-called grid bias can be derived, either capacitively, conductively or inductively depending on whether the oscillator is a Colpitts, <b>Hartley</b> <b>oscillator,</b> Armstrong tickler or a Meissner.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} activity carried {{out during the}} PhD {{is focused on the}} study, analysis and design of millimeter-wave integrated oscillator circuits for high-speed wireless communications. In Chapter 1 comparative analyses of phase noise (PN) in Hartley, Colpitts and commonsource cross-coupled differential pair LC oscillator topologies are carried out under common conditions in 28 nm CMOS technology. The impulse sensitivity function (ISF) is used to carry out both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the phase noise exhibited by each circuit component in each circuit topology with oscillation frequency ranging from 1 to 100 GHz. The comparative analyses show the existence of four distinct frequency regions in which the three oscillator topologies rank unevenly in terms of best phase noise performance, due to the combined effects of device noise and circuit node sensitivity. Moreover, the analyses show that there is no superior oscillator topology in the absolute sense, but that the identification of the best circuit topology with respect to phase noise is strictly related to the operating frequency range. In Chapter 2 comparative phase noise analyses of common-source cross-coupled pair, Colpitts, Hartley and Armstrong differential oscillator circuit topologies, designed in 28 nm bulk CMOS technology in a set of common conditions for operating frequencies in the range from 1 to 100 GHz, are carried out in order to identify their relative performance. The impulse sensitivity function is used to carry out qualitative and quantitative analyses of the noise contributions exhibited by each circuit component in each topology, allowing an understanding of their impact on phase noise. The comparative analyses show the existence of five distinct frequency regions in which the four topologies rank unevenly in terms of best phase noise performance. Moreover, the results obtained from the impulse sensitivity function show the impact of flicker noise contribution as the major effect leading to phase noise degradation in nano-scale CMOS LC oscillators. Chapter 3 reports a phase noise analysis in a differential Armstrong oscillator circuit topology in CMOS technology. The analytical expressions of phase noise due to flicker and thermal noise sources are derived and validated by the results obtained through SpectreRF simulations for oscillation frequencies of 1, 10 and 100 GHz. The analysis captures well the phase noise of the oscillator topology and shows the impact of flicker noise contribution as the major effect leading to phase noise degradation in nano-scale CMOS LC oscillators. Chapter 4 reports the analyses of three techniques for phase noise reduction in the CMOS Colpitts oscillator circuit topology. Namely, the three techniques are: inductive degeneration, noise filter, and optimum current density. The design of the circuit topology is carried out in 28 nm bulk CMOS technology. The analytical expression of the oscillation frequency is derived and validated through circuit simulations. Moreover, the theoretical analyses of the three techniques are carried out and verified by means of circuit simulations within a commercial design environment. The results obtained for the inductive degeneration and noise filter show the existence of an optimum inductance for minimum phase noise. The results obtained for the optimum bias current density technique applied to a Colpitts oscillator circuit topology incorporating either inductive degeneration or noise filter, show the existence of an optimum bias current density for minimum phase noise. Overall, the analyses show that, with respect to the reference values obtained in Chapter 2, the adoption of these techniques may lead to a potential phase noise reduction up to 19 dB and 17 dB at a 1 MHz frequency offset for the oscillation frequencies of 10 GHz and 100 GHz respectively. Chapter 5 reports the analyses of the three techniques discussed in Chapter 4, applied to the CMOS <b>Hartley</b> <b>oscillator</b> circuit topology. The design of the circuit topology is carried out in 28 nm bulk CMOS technology. The analytical expression of the oscillation frequency is derived and validated through circuit simulations. Moreover, the theoretical analyses of the three techniques are carried out and verified by means of circuit simulations. As {{in the case of the}} Colpitts topology, the results obtained for the inductive degeneration and noise filter show the existence of an optimum inductance for minimum phase noise. The results obtained for the optimum bias current density technique applied to a <b>Hartley</b> <b>oscillator</b> circuit topology incorporating either inductive degeneration or noise filter, show the existence of an optimum bias current density for minimum phase noise. Overall, wih respect to the reference values obtained in Chapter 2, the analyses show that the adoption of these techniques may lead to a potential phase noise reduction up to 17 dB and 16 dB at a 1 MHz frequency offset for the oscillation frequencies of 10 GHz and 100 GHz respectively, with respect to the traditional Hartley topology. Finally, Chapter 6 reports the design of an advanced solution, adopting the techniques discussed in Chapters 4 and 5. The voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) topology can be tuned from 58. 1 GHz to 63. 3 GHz. From periodic steady state (PSS) and periodic noise (Pnoise) SpectreRF simulations the best phase noise performance is observed for f 0 = 63. 3 GHz, and amounts to - 100. 2 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz frequency offset from the oscillation frequency, for a power consumption of 13. 6 mW.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is to {{analytically}} investigate a range of design issues for PAs used in SDR applications, particularly the trade-offs in view of broadband limitations. This thesis explores basic bandwidth limitation analysis and introduces various broadband PAs design, before applying this to the realization {{of a number of}} DAs. This gives an understanding on the bandwidth limitation and the conceptual target to achieve broadband amplifiers while other RF parameters are fulfilled. It {{is important to note that}} to achieve high DA efficiency performance, the multi current sources must be combined to a single load by presenting an optimum virtual impedance to each current source in two directions (Zu(k) and Zr(k)). Measurement results showed PAE > 30 % is achieved across the operating frequency range with a broadband impedance transformer employing parallel coupled line approach. As an important point, one should note that the design concept presented in this work provides appropriate guidelines to maximize DA efficiency. A novel topology of dual fed DA including input and output splitter realized by lumped elements, and with the termination adjusted for the optimum power performance with low DC supply voltage is presented. The termination adjustment is accomplished by relevant improvement obtained in comparison to the conventional DA topology demonstrates the effectiveness of the topology. For a first time, pole zero identification technique is applied to the DA, to understand the origin of the oscillation nature due to the multi loops nature. The analysis considers the DA as a basic feedback oscillator circuit i. e. <b>Hartley</b> <b>Oscillator</b> and using a simplified transistor model. The origin of the oscillation can be pointed to the trans-conductance nature or multi-loops nature associated due to the feedback network. Large-signal stability analysis based on pole-zero identification is applied to analyze parametric oscillations in high-efficiency DPA. Large-signal stability analysis is then used to stabilize a high-efficiency 3 -section LDMOS DPA with a minimum impact on circuit performance. Two DPA development for SDR PA applications are demonstrated good results, where the first one has achieved 10 W output power, 32 dB gain and PAE > 15 % across the operating bandwidth with cascaded DPA. To the researcher’s knowledge, the best performance in output power gain response within an operating bandwidth up to 2 GHz are demonstrated with low cost implementation technology, and consumes reasonable small size area. Second DPA development using device load pull impedance termination values to determine vector combining input and output network design demonstrated highest output power-efficiency in the state-of-art of the DPA results. Measurement results of output power more than 35 W is demonstrated, and with reasonable selection of impedance values will lead to optimum output power efficiency performance across bandwidth. To fulfill the impedance matching to 50 -ohm load, with reasonable minimum loss, small area and cost, an impedance transformer/filter from 12 -ohm to 50 -ohm is designed.

40|$|Eddy current (EC) based {{testing and}} {{measurement}} methods {{are well known}} in non-destructive testing (NDT) world. EC sensors are extensively studied and used for material health monitoring and its property measurement. Target displacement measurement {{is one of the}} well-known applications of EC method. The main advantage of EC sensor is its working capability in harsh environment like humidity, contamination etc. It is non-contact, rugged and requires less maintenance. The range and sensitivity of target displacement is mainly determined by the probe geometry and its construction method. Also displacement measurement depends upon geometry and electromagnetic (EM) properties of the target plate. Any variation of ambient temperature alters the EM properties of the probe as well as EM properties of the target. Thus, many parameters like geometry, EM properties and temperature involved in target displacement measurement. Hence, while using EC sensor for displacement measurement, it demands careful design and measurement procedure to achieve high sensitivity and high precision with low temperature drift. To achieve these, we present the following. 1) A temperature compensation technique 2) Optimization of probe geometry and its construction method to increase the range and sensitivity 3) Selection of suitable probe measurement parameter (Z, R, X) based on target material properties 4) Making the displacement measurement less sensitive to tolerance in probe construction parameter. A temperature compensation technique for target displacement measurement, using a self-running LC oscillator has been presented. A sensing coil is energized by a <b>Hartley</b> <b>oscillator.</b> The oscillator voltage is maintained at a constant level by a closed loop feedback circuit and the average feedback current to the oscillator is measured for target displacement detection. The temperature drift of the feedback current is compensated by applying temperature compensation function (TCF) and this is verified experimentally. Cold rolled mild steel (carbon steel) is taken as a target material and the sensor is tested over a temperature range of 20 °C – 80 °C. It shows that the temperature drift is less than ± 30 ppm/°C over 3 mm target displacement. To match all the sensor modules in mass production, components selection procedure is presented. To avoid mismatch across sensors in manufacturing process, the transistor based oscillator is modified with operational trans-conductance amplifier (OTA). The same temperature compensation formula (TCF) is applied to compensate the temperature drift of feedback current and achieved intended accuracy. Geometry and construction parameters of the eddy current sensing probe is optimized for target displacement measurement using Ansoft Maxwell, electromagnetic design software. EC probe with different geometry are analyzed in search of suitable geometry for target displacement measurement. Four shapes of commercially available core have been chosen for probe construction. For each shape of sensing probe, the radius and height of the probe is increased by 0 mm to 9 mm to find the effect of them on sensitivity and range of target displacement measurement. It has been observed that the probe with less height and maximum diameter has shown better performance. In addition to that, the probe geometry is optimized to achieve more sensitivity and range within the space available for probe mounting. It helps to utilize the available space effectively for probe design. Coil winding and mount-ing it inside the core window also important parameter in probe design. It has been observed that de-pressing the sensing coil inside the core window from sensing face by 3 mm decreases the sensitivity by 40 %. Hence, it is recommended to place the coil on the extreme end of the sensing face of the core. To know the effect of core permeability, it is varied from 1000 to 15000. It has been observed that it has no effect on sensitivity and measurement range. Only optimizing the probe geometry and its construction method is not adequate for target displacement measurement. We know that the EC based displacement measurement is also target material dependent. Generally probe impedance is measured and then the temperature drift of the sensing coil resistance is compensated to know the target displacement. Most of the temperature compensation techniques use this compensation technique and it is shown that those are suitable for high conductivity targets like copper. Choosing Z for displacement measurement may not be only best choice for all target materials. The displacement can be measured also through either R or X of the probe. Choosing the proper probe parameter for a given target material will provide a less temperature drift for target displacement measurement. To know about this, a simulation has been made for target displacement measurement with target metal of μr = 1, relative permittivity εr = 1, and temperature coefficient of resistivity ∝ = 0. 004 K- 1. The conductivity (σ) of the target is varied from 1 × 106 S/m to 62 × 106 S/m in the temperature range of 20 ℃ – 80 ℃. Now the simulation has been repeated by fixing  as a constant and varying target μr. The metal plate with  = 1 × 106 S/m, εr= 1 and ∝ = 0. 004 K – 1 is taken as a target and μr is varied from 100 to 10000. For both conductivity and permeability sweep analysis, the target displacement is measured as a function of Z, R and X independently. The temperature drift in displacement measurement is also analysed for the above temperature range. An experiment has been conducted with copper, stainless steel and mild steel as target metal in the temperature range of 20 ℃ – 80 ℃. The temperature drift is calculated when the displacement is measured as function of Z, R and X. Based on the results, we have identified that the target material relative permeability determines the selection of probe measurement parameter for target displacement measurement. Hence, knowing tar-get r alone suffice to select the probe measurement parameter (Z or R or X) for displacement measurement. Optimizing the probe geometry, selecting the proper probe measurement parameter and temperature compensation technique suffice to provide a good sensitivity, range and low temperature drift for a single probe. But in general, one of the mass produced probes is selected as a reference probe and it is calibrated against the ambient temperature and target displacement. And the calibration curves are loaded to all the probes. Matching the probe construction parameters to each other across the production patches is not possible in mass production. This makes the temperature compensation function and displacement calibration are different for every individual probes for displacement measurement. This degrades the measurement accuracy. A simulation has been performed with pot core with commercial tolerance. Using this, we have obtained 24 probes due to variations in 1) Individual and few combinational variations in core and coil dimensions 2) Core permeability variation and 3) relative position of the coil with respect to core. Finally, we have quantified the displacement error for each probe. We have identified the important probe dimensional parameters that have to be controlled precisely in mass production to improve the measurement accuracy. It shows error of 0. 86 % in the displacement measurement when the relative reactance and relative displacement is used for measurement. In practice, error in displacement measurement due to both the ambient temperature drift and the tolerance in probe construction parameter exist simultaneously. Hence, the combined error is computed for the target displacement range of 0 mm – 3 mm for the temperature range of 0 °C – 100 °C. The total error of less than 1 % is achieved for commercial standard probe tolerance. Finally, we have provided general factory production procedure and user calibration procedure of probe design to achieve cost effective displacement measurement with sensitivity and range with low temperature drift...|$|E
