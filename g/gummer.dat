They have four children: musician Henry (born 1979), actresses Mamie (born 1983) and Grace (born 1986), and model Louisa (born 1991).

25|$|A new Secretary of State, John Selwyn <b>Gummer,</b> {{had taken}} over in May, {{and he did not}} like these proposals, or the long time it took to produce them. <b>Gummer</b> sped-up the work plan and {{directed}} that all remaining reviews should start in December and be complete by the end of 1994. <b>Gummer</b> also issued new guidance, making it clear that wholly unitary solutions should be preferred, particularly ones smaller than existing counties but larger than existing districts. He further announced that Derbyshire and Durham would be referred back to the Commission for consideration under the new guidance. <b>Gummer</b> accepted the Commission's proposal to abolish Cleveland, but asked the Commission to consider Durham and Derbyshire again under the new guidance. The Labour Party, while remaining broadly in favour of unitary authorities, attacked the Commission for inconsistency. The leader of the Labour-controlled Derbyshire County Council questioned the inclusion of Derbyshire in the first tranche, which otherwise consisted mainly of counties newly created in 1974 and their neighbours.|$|E

25|$|Beaulieu reacted as the French {{commander}} hoped. Instead of concentrating {{his forces}} at the bridges, the Austrian commander attempted {{to set up}} a cordon defense on the river between Peschiera and Goito.

5000|$|In The Observer, Toby Young wrote: [...] "As {{nights of}} mob terror go, last Monday's {{party at the}} Federation of Conservative Students' Conference was pretty tame". [...] Both Young and Sir Alfred Sherman {{believed}} that <b>Gummer's</b> actions were motivated by {{his opposition to the}} libertarian ideology of some of the FCS' members which closely resembled some of Mrs Thatcher's personal beliefs. Sherman wrote that <b>Gummer's</b> actions were [...] "directed against the Prime Minister". Tim Hames and Nick Robinson later admitted that the bill presented for damage was less than £20, and that the media reports were {{as a result of an}} [...] "astute spinning operation" [...] by Wet delegates from the University of Oxford, who [...] "directed journalists to students who offered harrowing accounts of the boorish behaviour of libertarian activists." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Gummer's</b> {{first book}} was The Seventh at St. Andrews [...] (Gotham, 2007), a process story that chronicled the {{creation}} of the David McLay Kidd-designed Castle Course in Scotland. The book was not a how-to text on building a golf course, but rather the story of the people and the politics behind the scenes.|$|R

25|$|When the new Austrian army {{commander}} Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser {{advanced to}} the relief of the Siege of Mantua in late July, he formed his forces into four columns. See the Castiglione 1796 Campaign Order of Battle. The Right-Center Column was led by Michael von Melas and comprised the brigades of Peter <b>Gummer,</b> Adam Bajalics von Bajahaza, Franz Nicoletti, and Pittoni. The latter two reported to Sebottendorf. While Melas led <b>Gummer</b> and Bajalics over Monte Baldo by footpaths, Sebottendorf's two brigades fought {{their way down the}} road through Ferrara di Monte Baldo and Brentino Belluno. They accomplished their mission by driving back the French so that the Left-Center Column under Paul Davidovich could join them via the Adige River valley. The 900-man 11th Light Infantry Demi-Brigade and four guns were isolated and captured during the successful operation. Pittoni and Sebottendorf are not specifically mentioned in a detailed account of the Battle of Castiglione on 5 August 1796. In a preliminary action on 3 August, 1,000 Austrians became casualties and Pittoni's fellow brigadier Nicoletti was wounded. On the 5th, the Austrians were beaten with losses of 2,000 killed and wounded plus 1,000 men and 20 guns captured. The French counted 1,100 casualties.|$|E
25|$|Virtual Murder {{was in the}} mould of some earlier off-beat series, such as The Avengers and Adam Adamant Lives!, both {{shown in}} the 1960s. Like Steed and Emma Peel or Adam Adamant and Georgina Jones, Cornelius ("JC") and Valentine {{investigated}} a succession of rather eccentric or bizarre occurrences. They often did so {{in cooperation with the}} police, represented by Stephen Yardley as Inspector Cadogan and Jude Akuwudike as Sergeant <b>Gummer.</b> Complementing the occult elements and those of virtual reality, there was a thread of playful, sometimes dark humour running through the scripts and an underlying sexual frisson between Clay and Thomson.|$|E
25|$|In February 1994, Parliament {{considered}} {{reform of}} the law on rape and other sexual offences during {{the passage of the}} Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill.

Those who supported it included Tony Blair, John Smith, Neil Kinnock, Paddy Ashdown and William Hague. Those against included David Blunkett and Ann Taylor. There were angry scenes outside the Palace of Westminster at the defeat of the amendment, when those involved in a demonstration organised by the group OutRage! clashed with police. Another amendment proposed by Sir Anthony Durant suggested lowering the age of consent to 18, which passed by 427 votes to 162, and supporters included Michael Howard and John Major. It was opposed by such MPs as John Redwood, Michael Heseltine and John <b>Gummer.</b> An amendment proposed by Simon Hughes which was intended to equalise the age of consent for homosexuals and heterosexuals to 17 was not voted upon. The Bill as a whole was given a second reading in the Lords by 290 votes to 247. Lord Longford then sought to reintroduce 21 as the minimum age in the Lords, but this was defeated by 176 votes to 113. An amendment by the deputy Labour leader in the House of Lords, Lord MacIntosh of Haringey, that would have equalised the age of consent to 16, was rejected by 245 votes to 71.|$|E

The cast also included Peter Sarsgaard, Mamie <b>Gummer,</b> Denis Leary, and George Foreman. The production, directed by Martin Scorsese, began previews on January 17 and ended its limited run on March 1. Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News {{was less than}} enthusiastic about her performance, writing: [...] "Gyllenhaal, who was so dynamic as a druggie in the film Sherrybaby, plays Yelena with a slow-mo saunter and monotonous pasted-on smile that makes {{it seem as if}} she's been in Sherry's stash." [...] However, Malcolm Johnson of the Hartford Courant was complimentary, noting that she [...] "ultimately blossoms" [...] as the character.|$|E
