The PRONUREE, under the responsibility of the Secretariat of Energy, aims to be a vehicle for improving energy efficiency in the energy-consuming sectors and acknowledges that energy efficiency needs to be promoted with a long-term commitment and vision. It also acknowledges the connection between energy efficiency and sustainable development, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The program also recognizes the need for individual behavioral changes to be promoted with an <b>educational</b> <b>strategy,</b> with the public sector setting the example by assuming a leadership role in the implementation of energy conservation measures in its facilities.|$|E

In the first phase, a self-developed survey instrument {{was mailed to}} a stratified random sample of 1, 000 Presbyterian ministers. The survey instrument contained items relating to demographics, <b>educational</b> <b>strategies,</b> and techniques used when participating in continuing professional education. The data from 439 completed surveys was analyzed to determine if any significant relationships existed between gender, career choice and <b>educational</b> <b>strategies</b> and techniques used by Presbyterian ministers. The second phase consisted of telephone interviews with 12 Presbyterian ministers from the overall sample population. The interview consisted of questions relating to overall satisfaction with quality of available education strategies and techniques. Based on the data analysis and telephone interviews completed during this study, 4 conclusions were made. First, Presbyterian ministers are satisfied with the continuing professional education strategies and techniques that are available for their use. Second, {{there is no difference}} between gender, career choice and <b>educational</b> <b>strategies</b> and techniques of Presbyterian ministers in this study. Third, concerning continuing education practices, Presbyterian ministers use the methods they were taught in their pre-professional training.

40|$|Educational {{practice}} and educational research are not aligned with each other. Current educational practice heavily relies on information transmission or content delivery to learners.

To illustrate the directions we might take to find better <b>educational</b> <b>strategies,</b> six areas of educational evidence are briefly reviewed. The flipped classroom idea is proposed to shift our expenditure and focus in education. All information delivery could be web distributed, thus creating more time for other more expensive <b>educational</b> <b>strategies</b> to support the learner. In research our focus should shift from comparing one curriculum to the other, to research that explains why things work in education and under which conditions.

At the same time attention should be paid to implementation and the realization that teachers learn in a way {{very similar to the}} people they teach. If we take the evidence seriously, our educational practice will look quite different to the way it does now...|$|R

In other words, service-learning aims to link the personal and interpersonal development with cognitive development, as well as equipping the student with critical knowledge to help them understand the world.|$|E

Teachers from specialized schools for gifted pupils have a stronger tendency to label them.
