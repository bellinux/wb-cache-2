40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of a predictable quantum efficient detector (PQED), suggested {{to be capable of}} measuring optical power with a relative uncertainty of 1 ppm (ppm = parts per million), is presented. The structure and working principle of <b>induced</b> <b>junction</b> silicon photodiodes are described combined with the design of the PQED. The detector uses two custom-made large area photodiodes assembled into a light-trapping configuration, reducing the reflectance down to a few tens of ppm. A liquid nitrogen cryostat is used to cool the <b>induced</b> <b>junction</b> photodiodes to 78 K to improve the mobility of charge carriers and to reduce the dark current. To determine the predicted spectral responsivity, reflectance losses of the PQED were measured at room temperature and at 78 K and also modelled throughout the visible wavelength range from 400 nm to 800 nm. The measured values of reflectance at room temperature were 29. 8 ppm, 22. 8 ppm and 6. 6 ppm at the wavelengths of 476 nm, 488 nm and 532 nm, respectively, whereas the calculated reflectances were about 4 ppm higher. The reflectance at 78 K was measured at the wavelengths of 488 nm and 532 nm over a period of 60 h during which the reflectance changed by about 20 ppm. The main uncertainty components in the predicted internal quantum deficiency (IQD) of the <b>induced</b> <b>junction</b> photodiodes are due to the reliability of the charge-carrier recombination model and the extinction coefficient of silicon at wavelengths longer than 700 nm. The expanded uncertainty of the predicted IQD is 2 ppm at 78 K over a limited spectral range and below 140 ppm at room temperature over the visible wavelength range. All the above factors are combined as the external quantum deficiency (EQD), which is needed for the calculation of the predicted spectral responsivity of the PQED. The values of the predicted EQD are below 70 ppm between the wavelengths of 476 nm and 760 nm, and their expanded uncertainties mostly vary between 10 ppm and 140 ppm, where the lowest uncertainties are obtained at low temperatures...|$|E

40|$|The {{predictable}} quantum efficient detector (PQED) {{consists of}} two custom-made <b>induced</b> <b>junction</b> photodiodes that are mounted in a wedged trap configuration for the reduction of reflectance losses. Until now, all manufactured PQED photodiodes {{have been based on}} a structure where a SiO 2 layer is thermally grown on top of p-type silicon substrate. In this paper, we present the design, manufacturing, modelling and characterization of a new type of PQED, where the photodiodes have an Al 2 O 3 layer on top of n-type silicon substrate. Atomic layer deposition is used to deposit the layer to the desired thickness. Two sets of photodiodes with varying oxide thicknesses and substrate doping concentrations were fabricated. In order to predict recombination losses of charge carriers, a 3 D model of the photodiode was built into Cogenda Genius semiconductor simulation software. It {{is important to note that}} a novel experimental method was developed to obtain values for the 3 D model parameters. This makes the prediction of the PQED responsivity a completely autonomous process. Detectors were characterized for temperature dependence of dark current, spatial uniformity of responsivity, reflectance, linearity and absolute responsivity at the wavelengths of 488 nm and 532 nm. For both sets of photodiodes, the modelled and measured responsivities were generally in agreement within the measurement and modelling uncertainties of around 100 parts per million (ppm). There is, however, an indication that the modelled internal quantum deficiency may be underestimated by a similar amount. Moreover, the responsivities of the detectors were spatially uniform within 30 ppm peak-to-peak variation. The results obtained in this research indicate that the n-type <b>induced</b> <b>junction</b> photodiode is a very promising alternative to the existing p-type detectors, and thus give additional credibility to the concept of modelled quantum detector serving as a primary standard. Furthermore, the manufacturing of PQEDs is no longer dependent on the availability of a certain type of very lightly doped p-type silicon wafers. Peer reviewe...|$|E

An EJ-MOSFET is different from conventional CMOS device in that the gate voltage electrically induces the shallow source-drain extensions (SDEs). In such a device the SDEs are underneath the gate and contain low-doped regions of opposite conductivity as that of deep source-drain (S/D). In order to turn ON the device, a voltage is applied at the gate of EJ-MOSFET device, such that these low doped regions below poly-Si gate get inverted and serve as SDEs. Consequently, the effective channel length in this condition is the distance between these low-doped regions. On the contrary, at any gate voltage less than that required for inverting these regions, no SDEs are induced, and the effective channel length {{is equal to the}} physical separation between the deep S/D junctions...|$|E

Design and characterization results are presented for a new compact room temperature PQED that consists of two custom-made <b>induced</b> <b>junction</b> photodiodes mounted in a wedged trap configuration. The detector assembly includes a window aligned in Brewster angle {{in front of the}} photodiodes for high transmission of p polarized light. The detector can also be operated without the window, in which case a dry nitrogen flow system is utilized to prevent dust contamination of the photodiodes. Measurements of individual detectors at the wavelength of 488 nm indicate that reflectance and internal quantum efficiency are consistent within 14 ppm and 10 ppm (ppm = part per million), respectively, and agree with the predicted values. The measured photocurrent ratio of the two photodiodes confirms the predicted value for s and p polarized light, and the spatial variation in the photocurrent ratio can be used to estimate the uniformity in the thickness of the silicon dioxide layer {{on the surface of the}} photodiodes. In addition, the spatial non-uniformity of the responsivity of the PQED is an order of magnitude lower than that of single photodiodes. Such data provide evidence that the room temperature PQED may replace the cryogenic radiometer as a primary standard of optical power in the visible wavelength range. ...|$|E

Induced p+–p and p–n junctions were formed {{on both sides}} of the silicon wafer by thermally evaporating semitransparent metal layers of palladium and aluminium respectively. As such, no thermal treatment was given to the device, and therefore there is no diffusion of impurities inside the semiconductor and the two junctions are induced in the form of accumulation and depletion regions of charge carriers respectively. Both generation and recombination lifetimes applicable under the reverse and forward bias conditions respectively have been measured. The generation lifetime was estimated to be around 73 µs, whereas the recombination lifetime has been found to be about 11 µs. It is shown that the effective recombination lifetime is determined mainly by surface recombination velocity at the silicon–palladium interface. The effective minority carrier lifetime as measured by the microwave-detected photoconductive decay method on the same sample is 12 µs which is close to the measured recombination value by the IST. This shows that impedance spectroscopy can be used to measure effective lifetime of the wafer using an <b>induced</b> <b>junction</b> structure prior to the formation of an actual device like the solar cell. Moreover, the series resistance (Rs), diode ideality factor (n) and barrier height (Vbi) obtained from C–V (using the IST) data as well as the I–V measurement of the device show agreement with the expected device parameters.

40|$|This thesis {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the Predictable Quantum Efficient Detector designed to measure optical radiation with theoretical relative uncertainty of 1 ppm (parts per million). The device is based on two custom made large area <b>induced</b> <b>junction</b> silicon photodiodes arranged in a wedged trap structure. High internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the photodiodes is achieved by means of low doping concentration and usage of the reverse bias voltage. The IQE is predicted to be improved furthermore using low operating temperature close to 77 K. The losses due to reflected light are minimized by multiple reflections between the photodiodes. Low losses allow the PQED to work as an ideal quantum detector whose spectral responsivity is determined purely by the fundamental constants h, c, e and vacuum wavelength lambda. The remaining minor charge carrier losses are predictable using physical modelling whereas fractional reflectance losses can be measured. These properties classify the PQED as an absolute detector which does not require calibration against any other radiometric primary standard. The prototype PQED was compared against present primary standard - the cryogenic radiometer – at the wavelengths of 476 nm, 532 nm and 760 nm at room temperature and at liquid nitrogen temperature. Comparisons showed that the predicted external quantum deficiency of the PQED agreed with the measured external quantum deficiency within the expanded uncertainty of 60 ppm to 180 ppm determined by the cryogenic radiometer at both temperatures. These results indicate that the responsivity of the PQED is highly predictable and its uncertainty is comparable with the uncertainty of the conventional cryogenic radiometer. Such data provide evidence that the cryogenic radiometer operated close to 10 K temperatures may be replaced by a PQED operated even at room temperature. The advantage of the PQED is its simple operation which is comparable with any other silicon based photodetector whereas its optical radiation detection uncertainty is comparable with expensive and sophisticated cryogenic radiometer...|$|E
40|$|Epithelial {{cells are}} characterised by a tight {{intercellular}} adhesion. Disassembly of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion can induce {{a transition from}} a benign epithelial phenotype to an invasive mesenchymal phenotype. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms leading to adherens junction disruption will provide insights into potential therapeutic agents to prevent tumour metastasis. The small GTPases Arf 6 and Rac can each disassemble E-cadherin-based junctions, upon which epithelial cells scatter. Preliminary results in our lab showed that Rae requires PAK function during junction disassembly and that Arf 6 disrupts keratinocyte junctions in a process dependent on Rac signalling. Crosstalk between Arf 6 and Rac has been described previously, but. the exact molecular mechanisms involved during Arf 6 -induced junction disassembly are not known. A good candidate molecule to provide the link between Arf 6 and Rac is GIT 1. GIT 1 interacts with active Arf 6 by an Arf 6 GAP domain and induces Rac activation via binding to the RacGEF 0 PIX. Rac regulates many cellular. processes in which no effector proteins have been yet identified, inclUding perturbation of cell-cell contacts. Using a keratinocyte eDNA library screen with active Rac as bait, a new Rac binding protein named Armus has been isolated previously. This protein is interesting as in addition to binding specifically to active Rac, it contains a TBC/RabGAP domain at its C-terminus, which is predicted to inactivate Rab small GTPases. Armus function is currently unknown. The aim of my PhD project was to test the involvement of GIT 1, PAK and Armus in the disassembly of E-cadherin junctions induced by active Arf 6 and Rac. I found that GIT 1 and D-PIX might provide the link towards Rac signalling during Arf 6 <b>induced</b> <b>junction</b> disassembly. Furthermore, expression of the TBC/RabGAP domain of Armus can block Arf 6 -induced junction disruption by inactivating Rab 7. In contrast, the Rac effector PAK 1 does not playa role in Arf 6 -dependent junction disassembly.

40|$|Opila, Robert L. Photovoltaic (PV) devices hold {{great promise}} {{for the future}} of {{renewable}} energy [...] especially with an ever increasing societal demand for electricity. In order for PV to be able to compete with incumbent energy sources it must be financially competitive. With today's state-of-the-art technology, high efficiency devices reduce balance of system costs, but this also comes with a higher initial cost. In order to make PV competitive, then, the trend between high efficiency and high cost must be broken to introduce high efficiency devices that are also low cost. In order to address this issue, work on hybrid organic/inorganic PV devices will be presented here. This work begins with the concept of the <b>induced</b> <b>junction</b> [...] or heterojunction [...] device. A layer of amorphous material is deposited on a crystalline substrate. This amorphous material performs two functions: passivating the substrate and causing band bending at the crystal surface. Traditionally, this device has used amorphous silicon deposited on crystalline silicon (c-Si), with impressive results. In this work, the amorphous Si is replaced with an organic layer to perform the same device functionality. The organic compound quinhydrone (QHY) is a high-quality c-Si passivant, and, for this work, was broken into its constituent components [...] p-benzoquinone (BQ) and hydroquinone (HQ) [...] for the study of its bonding mechanisms. After examining the effects of time and light on the passivation by BQ and HQ of c-Si, a bonding mechanism is proposed and BQ is shown to be the active passivant. Density functional theory confirms the role of light in the surface reaction and its effective passivity, and surface analysis through XPS experimentally shows the types of bonds being formed. Hybrid devices were also fabricated, using BQ as both passivant and bandbending layer in an organic/inorganic hybrid device. A Poly(3, 4 ethylenedioxythiophene) -poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer is the contact layer.

40|$|A silicon gated diode, being {{evolved from}} MOSFET {{technology}} and utilizing {{a half of}} MOSFET, has been developed as LED) {{for the first time}} to demonstrate unique electric field modulation of light emission characteristics. In contrast to a reverse biased traditional two-terminal Si-diode possessing light emission modulation by current signal, this three-terminal Si-gated diode is capable of modulating optical emission by applied gate voltage signal, which is directly compatible with a standard CMOSFET circuit operation easing monolithic integration of logic circuit implementation and a light emission diode on silicon technology. The gate applied voltage can produce two effects on the gated diode. Firstly, it induces carrier concentration modulation at both channel and source/drain region underneath the gate, thus modulating electric field strength and distribution. Secondly, an inversion layer of surface carriers underneath the gate in the source or drain overlap region can be formed at a certain gate applied voltage. Since the inversion layer of carriers is formed at heavily doped semiconductor, a tunneling current can be observed in such a field <b>induced</b> <b>junction.</b> These two combined effects of electric field modulation and tunneling current injection in the high electric field region lead to unique light emission characteristics. Fabricated in a standard CMOS process technology, silicon p-n junction diodes (source/substrate or drain/substrate) and gated p-n junction diodes (gate/source/substrate or gate/drain/substrate) are used in this study to compare their light emission characteristics and device performance. The pn junction diode operating at avalanche breakdown conditions has visible light emission originating from the depletion region as confirmed by 2 D device simulation and experimental measurement results. It is believed that this optical radiation comes from carriers generated by impact ionization losing their kinetic energy by colliding with immobile charged centers in the avalanche region. A theoretical model is presented to show the correlation of photonic emission with the electric field strength, also known as the hot carrier effect with the related high electric field. The gated pn junction diode operating at electric field assisted tunneling current conditions has visible light emission originating from the gate/drain or gate/source overlap region as confirmed by 2 D device simulation and experimental measurement results. Both pn junction diode and gated pn junction diode exhibits a linear dependence of light emission intensity on the device terminal current. The only difference between them is that the pn junction diode is controlled by the avalanche current initiated by the junction leakage current while the gated diode by the tunneling current. It has been discovered that, at the same terminal current, the optical output power in gated diode is higher than that in diode, indicating higher quantum efficiency in the gated diode. To compare LED device performance, the electro-optic modulation schemes and speed in the pn diode and the gated diode are analyzed in detail, showing a modulation speed of a few tens of gigahertz achievable in the gated LED.

40|$|A {{monolithic}} ZnO-on-silicon surface {{acoustic wave}} (SAW) memory correlator has been fabricated which utilizes <b>induced</b> <b>junctions</b> separated by ion implanted regions to shore a reference signal. The performance characteristics of this device have been investigated including storage time, dynamic range, and degenerate convolution efficiency. Verification {{of the existence of}} charge storage regions is possible prior to completed device fabrication. ^ A theory explaining the charge storage process is developed and applied to the implant-isolated storage correlator. The implant-isolated correlator theory is applied to related structures which employ slightly different storage mechanisms. The ion implanted correlator is used to determine the wave potential associated with a propagating SAW. ^ Characteristics of ZnO-on-Si SAW resonators with sputtered ZnO films limited to the interdigital transducer (IDT) regions are investigated. Upper limits on propagation loss for surface waves on silicon substrates are determined by employing externally coupled limited ZnO SAW resonators. Resonator Q-values are enhanced by restricting the lossy ZnO area and predictions are made as to achievable Q-values for resonators fabricated in the externally coupled configuration. Experimental results for limited ZnO, internally coupled ZnO-on-Si resonators are also given. ^ A complete theory for the mode conversion resonator is presented which predicts the array separation for proper device operation. The theory also gives way to a special condition for spatial independence of resonator output with respect to IDT placement. Mode conversion resonators are fabricated which experimentally verify these predictions. ...|$|R
40|$|Even though various {{contraceptive}} {{methods are}} widely available, {{the number of}} unwanted pregnancies {{is still on the}} rise in developing countries, pressurizing the already resource limited nations. One of the major underlying reasons is the lack of effective, low cost, and safe contraceptives for couples. During the past decade, some studies were performed using animal models to decipher if the Sertoli-germ cell junction in the testis is a target for male fertility regulation. Some of these study models were based on the use of hormones and/or chemicals to disrupt the hypothalamicpituitary-testicular axis (e. g., androgen-based implants or pills) and others utilized a panel of chemical entities or synthetic peptides to perturb spermatogenesis either reversibly or non-reversibly. Among them, adjudin, a potential male contraceptive, is one of the compounds exerting its action on the unique adherens junctions, known as ectoplasmic specializations, in the testis. Since the testis is equipped with inter-connected cell junctions, an initial targeting of one junction type may affect the others and these accumulative effects could lead to spermatogenic arrest. This review attempts to cover an innovative theme on how male infertility can be achieved by <b>inducing</b> <b>junction</b> instability and defects in the testis, opening a new window of research for male contraceptive development. While it will still take much time and effort of intensive investigation before a product can reach the consumable market, these findings have provided hope for better family planning involving men. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} steroidal and nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} receptor-binding ligands were tested {{for their ability}} to affect the formation and internalization of gap junctions in hypophysectomized rat uterine myometrial and serosal cells. Potent estrogens, including diethyistilbestrol, estradiol benzoate (EB), estradiol- 1 7 j 3, and the weak estrogens, estriol and estrone, stimulate formation of macular and annular gap junctions in myometrium in a dose-dependent fashion when administered in daily injections over 5 days. Induction of annular gap junctions in the uterine serosal epithelium follows a similar dose-dependent pattern of estrogen stimulation but requires lower levels of hormone to initiate the response. In myometrium, differential stimulation of circular and longi-tudinal myometrial cell layers was observed, with 3 to 5 times more gap junctions detected in the circular than in the longitudinal layer. Progesterone, estriol, or estrone suppress the myometrial gap junction response to EB when administered concurrently with EB. However, the EB-stimulated appearance of myometrial cell gap junctions was blocked hen the progesterone-to-estrogen ratio exceeded 100 : 1. The estrogen receptor-binding androgens, 5 a-androstane- 3 j 3, 1 7 j 3 -diol (Adiol) and L -androstene- 3 3, 1 7 (3 -diol failed to <b>induce</b> myometrial gap <b>junctions</b> at doses up to 5 mg/day for 5 days, whereas Adiol did <b>induce</b> annular gap <b>junctions</b> in the serosal cells at the highest dosage tested. Of the triphenylethylene derivatives and related compounds evaluated, including mixed isomers of tam oxifen and CI 628, the cis (zuclomiphene, ZUC) and trans (enclomiphene) isomers of clomiphene citrate, and a fixed-ring antiestrogen, nafoxidine, only ZUC was able to <b>induce</b> gap <b>junctions</b> in myometrial and serosal cells. These studies indicate that induction of gap junctions in rat uterine myometrial cells is an estrogen-dependent response that requires higher levels of estrogen than other estrogen-dependent target cell responses in the rodent uterus...|$|R
