5|$|During {{the winter}} {{solstice}} meeting, the gods are finally convinced by Artemis {{to take action against}} the Titans. Thalia is also asked by Artemis to become an immortal Huntress, and her acceptance {{is the only thing that}} prevents the onset of the Great Prophecy. Percy is told by his father that Luke is somehow not dead, and he and Annabeth return to Camp Half-Blood worried about the future. Before he can relax, however, Percy is forced to explain Bianca's death to Nico. Nico blames Percy, and when a group of spartoi arrive to attack the son of Poseidon, Nico banishes them to the realm of Hades, and Percy realizes that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> son of Hades. Nico runs away, and the only people Percy tells the truth are Annabeth and Grover. They promise to hide this fact from everyone else, especially the Titan's army.|$|E
5|$|To have {{qualified}} for the national team under IIHF rules, a player must have met several criteria. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> citizen of the nation, and be {{under the jurisdiction of}} that national association. Players are allowed to change which national team they represent, providing they fulfill the IIHF criteria. If participating {{for the first time in}} an IIHF event, the player was required to have played two consecutive years in the national competition of the new country without playing in another country. If the player has already played for a national team before, he may switch countries if he is a citizen of the new country, and has played for four consecutive years in the national competition of the new country. This switch may happen only once in the player's life.|$|E

6000|$|... "He begins, 'Prins {{and dear}} Cousin!' I say, Jaqueline, he spells it 'Prins;' now it <b>is</b> P-R-I-N-C-E. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ignorant fellow!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo, Ralph!" [...] cried Bill in surprise, [...] "that chap {{seems to}} have taken a sudden fancy to you, or <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> old acquaintance." ...|$|R
25|$|He {{had once}} been a truth-teller, but living with a woman who assumed that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> liar, he had ended by {{becoming}} one.|$|E
25|$|Australians regard fielding as a love, not a task. Every {{aspiring}} young Australian knows <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fielding specialist to {{get into}} a Test team and so he goes to work accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Dede: This is {{the leader}} of the Cem who {{represents}} Muhammad and Ali. The Dede receives confession from the attendees at the beginning of the ceremony. He also leads funerals, Müsahiplik, marriage ceremonies and circumcisions. The status of Dede is hereditary and <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> descendant of Ali and Fatima.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your taste," [...] {{he remarked}} a little spitefully, [...] "would <b>be</b> {{considered}} <b>a</b> trifle strange. Souspennier carries his years well, but <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> old man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Jenny,' he said, 'I {{am afraid}} your protege {{does not come}} out of it very well; that is, if he <b>is</b> your protege. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> uncommonly foolish young man.' ...|$|R
60|$|Even at that crisis, Mike {{could not}} help feeling that if a row of this caliber did not draw Mr. Outwood from his bed, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> unusual kind of housemaster.|$|R
25|$|Protagoras {{was born}} in Abdera, Thrace, {{opposite}} the island of Thasos (today part of the Xanthi regional unit). According to Aulus Gellius, he originally made his living as a porter, but one day he was seen by the philosopher Democritus carrying a load of small pieces of wood he had tied with a short cord. Democritus realized that Protagoras had tied the load together with such perfect geometric accuracy that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mathematical prodigy. Democritus promptly took him into his own household and taught him philosophy. Protagoras became well known in Athens and even became a friend of Pericles.|$|E

25|$|Rumple {{returns home}} to his wife Belle and their newborn baby son. Unfortunately, Isaac is there waiting, and tells him that his happy ending will be taken away if a boy named Henry succeeds in his quest to reverse {{the events of the}} new book. As he is without his real memories, Rumple does not believe Isaac, {{thinking}} <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> demon trying to corrupt him, until Isaac mentions Baelfire, a secret from Rumple's past that he has been keeping from Belle. Isaac then tells him that he must thwart Henry and Regina's plan to stop Robin and Zelena's wedding in order for him to keep his happy ending.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{to marry}} me," [...] {{explained}} Ann. [...] "But I told him <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> unnatural little beast {{not to try}} to like me when he knew how you loved me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Loudon, Loudon!" [...] said he, [...] "you boys think yourselves very smart. But, {{struggle}} as you please, {{a man has}} to work in this world. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> {{honest man}} or a thief, Loudon." ...|$|R
60|$|If it {{was love}} that was {{to bring him back}} <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> exile for ever. His epitaph in the mouths of those that remembered him would be, Comus Bassington, the boy who never came back.|$|R
25|$|Fisher {{was born}} in Saugerties, New York. His father was a teacher and a Congregational minister, who raised his son to believe <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> useful member of society. Despite being raised in {{religious}} family, he later on became an atheist. As a child, he had remarkable mathematical ability and a flair for invention. A week after he was admitted to Yale College his father died, at age 53. Irving then supported his mother, brother, and himself, mainly by tutoring. He graduated first in his class with a B.A degree in 1888, having also been elected {{as a member of}} the Skull and Bones society.|$|E
500|$|... "Saturdays of Thunder" [...] is {{the ninth}} episode of The Simpsons third season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on November 14, 1991. In the episode, Homer takes a fatherhood quiz and realizes that he knows nothing about Bart. He strives {{to be a better}} father and learns that Bart is participating in a Soap Box Derby. Homer and Bart make a racer together; however, it is not very good. Bart decides to drive Martin's far superior racer instead, after Martin is involved in an accident where he receives a broken arm. Homer is at first devastated, but decides that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good father and support Bart.|$|E
2500|$|The naval {{deep sea}} diver {{qualification}} insignia are awarded in four degrees: second-class diver; first-class diver; master diver; and diving officer. [...] However, the Marine Corps does not award the diving officer insignia to its officers. [...] In the Navy, the master diver {{is the most}} qualified diver; <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> chief petty officer before applying to attend the master diver course.|$|E
2500|$|... "To a goalkeeper alone," [...] Roose concluded, [...] "is {{the true}} delight of goalkeeping known. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> instinctive lover of the game, {{otherwise}} goalkeeping {{will take it}} out of a man if he is not devoted to it." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} a third party {{beneficiary}} to have any rights under the contract, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> intended beneficiary, {{as opposed to an}} incidental beneficiary. The burden is on the third party to plead and prove that he <b>was</b> indeed <b>an</b> intended beneficiary.|$|R
5000|$|The supreme {{head of the}} Syriac Orthodox Church {{is named}} Patriarch of Antioch, in {{reference}} to his titular pretense {{to one of the}} five patriarchates of the Pentarchy of early Eastern Christianity. Considered the [...] "father of fathers", <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ordained bishop.|$|R
2500|$|This did not, as some think, prevent investment. What it stipulated {{was that}} in order for the {{investor}} to share in the profit he must share the risk. In short <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> joint-venturer. Simply to invest the money and expect it to be returned regardless {{of the success of the}} venture was to make money simply by having money and not by taking any risk or by doing any work or by any effort or sacrifice at all. This is usury. St Thomas quotes Aristotle as saying that [...] "to live by usury is exceedingly unnatural". St Thomas allows, however, charges for actual services provided. Thus a banker or credit-lender could charge for such actual work or effort as he did carry out e.g. any fair administrative charges.|$|E
2500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review in}} the September 1815 Christian Observer stated, [...] "To the poem of Roderick, Mr. Southey has annexed a voluminous collection of notes. The taste of our elder authors in this respect is now entirely obsolete. Our Shakespeares and Miltons never thought it necessary to ballast their poetry with a mass of prose, and perhaps felt secure that, if they found the text, posterity would not fail to find the commentary." [...] The review concluded, [...] "Those productions, in the mean time, have a far more than compensating merit. On the present occasion, if the commentator of Roderick appears scarcely worthy of the poet, yet <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very fastidious, or a very dull reader, who does not find the evil of possessing the commentary, infinitely overpaid by the gratification of reading the poem." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Great Depression many economists traditionally argued against deficit spending. The fear was that government spending would [...] "crowd out" [...] private investment and would thus not have any effect on the economy, a proposition known as the Treasury view. Keynesian economics rejected that view. They argued that by spending vastly more money—using fiscal policy—the government could provide the needed stimulus through the multiplier effect. Without that stimulus business simply would not hire more people, especially the low skilled and supposedly [...] "untrainable" [...] men who had been unemployed for years and lost any job skill they once had. Keynes visited the White House in 1934 to urge President Roosevelt to increase deficit spending. Roosevelt afterwards complained that, [...] "he left a whole rigmarole of figures – <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mathematician rather than a political economist." ...|$|E
60|$|The gentleman {{raised his}} hat and asked if Mrs. Cliff lived there. Now Willy thought <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> {{extraordinary}} fine gentleman, for how should he know that she <b>was</b> not <b>a</b> servant, and in those parts gentlemen did not generally raise their hats to girls who opened front doors.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Browning {{was very}} kind and warm in his {{expressions}} of pleasure at seeing us; and, on our part, {{we were all}} very glad to meet him. <b>He</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> exceedingly likable man.

2500|$|Mr Dinos {{began his}} third {{campaign}} in the Group Two Henry II Stakes over two miles at Sandown Park Racecourse on 26 May {{in which he was}} ridden by Frankie Dettori. He started 6/1 second favourite behind the Doncaster Cup winner Boreas with the other runners including Persian Punch, Bangalore and Hugs Dancer (Ebor Handicap). After racing in third place he took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths and a neck from Pole Star and Kasthari. Dettori, who was contracted to ride Mamool in the season's major staying events said of the winner [...] "I like him a lot. That was a tremendous performance first time out. He's done well over the winter. He's {{going to be very hard}} to get by. We will give him a big race but <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> big danger in the Gold Cup." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter {{gathered}} anthropometric data on 3,284 persons, analysed 198 blood samples, bought clothes, jewellery, books (such as the Tengyur and Kangyur), {{and various}} other objects now found at the National Museum of Denmark and the Royal Library. He assembled a list of Tibetan noble families and, along with his wife, established biographical notes {{about a number of}} refugees (most notably about women who practised polyandry, [...] "something really at variance with our way of conducting family affairs"), and described Tibetan Muslims. Having registered their songs, sagas, everyday conversations, oracle prophecies and religious ceremonies, Peter took more than 3,000 photographs of Tibetans. When he asked them if they had body hair (an important piece of information in anthropology), the relatively hairless Tibetans roared with laughter. They were excited when he showed them his own chest hair, and exclaimed that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> monkey. One man did not understand why the Prince bothered to wear a shirt, given that he already had hair.|$|E
2500|$|Emanuel Custer was {{an outspoken}} Democrat who taught his {{children}} politics and toughness {{at an early}} age. In a February 3, 1887 letter to his son's widow, Libby, he related an incident [...] "when Autie [...] was about four years old. He {{had to have a}} tooth drawn, [...] and he was very much afraid of blood. When I took him to the doctor to have the tooth pulled, it was in the night and I told him if it bled well it would get well right away, and <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good soldier. When he got to the doctor he took his seat, and the pulling began. The forceps slipped off and he had to make a second trial. He pulled it out, and Autie never even scrunched. Going home, I led him by the arm. He jumped and skipped, and said 'Father you and me can whip all the Whigs in Michigan.' I thought that was saying a good deal but I did not contradict him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{have pulled}} down the factory and I expect the agent's dead," [...] Thirlwell replied. [...] "If not, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> old man and I don't know where he is. I'm not persuaded yet that Strange did find the ore; but if it hadn't snowed, I'd have {{followed}} Stormont's trail. It {{would be interesting to}} know where he means to look." ...|$|R
60|$|That Carry and {{her father}} had emigrated to America was the general opinion; Mop, no doubt, finding the girl a highly {{desirable}} companion when he had trained her to keep him by her earnings as a dancer. There, for that matter, they may be performing in some capacity now, though <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> old scamp verging on threescore-and-ten, and she a woman of four-and-forty.|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{income is}} nearly fifty {{thousand}} a year," [...] the Princess remarked, [...] "so <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> forgiven <b>a</b> few eccentricities of manner." ...|$|R
