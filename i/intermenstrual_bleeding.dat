40|$|The precise {{mechanism}} of action of the intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) is uncertain.

40|$|Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids or myomas) are benign tumors of uterus and {{clinically}} {{apparent in}} {{a large part of}} reproductive aged women. Clinically, they present with a variety of symptoms: excessive menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhoea and <b>intermenstrual</b> <b>bleeding,</b> chronic pelvic pain, and pressure symptoms such as a sensation of bloatedness, increased urinary frequency, and bowel disturbance. In addition, they may compromise reproductive functions, possibly contributing to subfertility, early pregnancy loss, and later pregnancy complications. Despite the prevalence of this condition, myoma research is underfunded compared to other nonmalignant diseases. To date, several pathogenetic factors such as genetics, microRNA, steroids, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix components have been implicated in the development and growth of leiomyoma.

Abnormal uterine bleeding included heavy menstrual bleeding, <b>intermenstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> and postmenopausal bleeding. Women were excluded if office polypectomy was considered not feasible, malignancy was suspected or another surgical uterine intervention was needed. All participants provided written informed consent. In clinics which provided a ‘see and treat’ service, consent was obtained and the patient was registered on the on-line recruitment system prior to the diagnostic hysteroscopy, so that if a uterine polyp was diagnosed and the woman’s preference was for office polypectomy, treatment could be performed straight away without an interruption to register the patient into the study.|$|E
30|$|Results: Within the 54  months duration, 3, 694 {{cases of}} {{hysteroscopy}} were {{performed in the}} clinic and 333 cases (9 %) of failed procedure were reported. The causes of failure included: 219 cases (66 %) of cervical stenosis, 65 cases (20 %) of pain or discomfort, 36 cases (11 %) of poor view, 28 cases (8 %) of inability to visualise cervix, 19 cases (6 %) of inability to pass speculum, 15 cases (5 %) of acutely anteverted or retroverted uterus and eight cases (2 %) of vaso-vagal attack.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the noncontraceptive {{benefits}} of two combined oral contraceptives, containing progestins with well-known antiandrogenic properties, in adolescent girls. Study Design: In this prospective observational study, the effects of two formulations containing 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol combined with 2 mg chlormadinone acetate or 3 mg drospiretione were compared. Six-month data were obtained from 156 sexually active adolescents requiring contraception. We investigated the advantages of these regimens on <b>intermenstrual</b> <b>bleeding,</b> dysmenorrhea, acne and hair and skin disorders. Furthermore, their effects on sexual interest, intercourse frequency and sexual satisfaction were evaluated. Conclusion: Both preparations provided effective contraception, good cycle control and beneficial effects on preexisting hair and skin disorders without effects on body weight. However, the best results were obtained with the formulation containing chlormadinone acetate, with the difference being statistically significant. Furthermore, the contraceptive adherence to teenager expectations and the counseling effectiveness enhancing compliance contribute to a high rate of continuation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|We {{report on}} the results of a double-blind, randomized, {{controlled}} clinical trial comparing two preparations of ethinylestradiol and cyproterone acetate in the treatment of women of reproductive age presenting menstrual irregularities of hyper-androgenic origin. After obtaining informed consent, subjects were randomized to a 4 -month treatment period consisting of one daily dose of 0. 035 mg ethinylestradiol + 2 mg cyproterone acetate. The treatment regimen cycle consisted of one pill, once daily for 21 days, followed by a 7 -day pill-free period. We compared the efficacy of two presentations of the drug combination after each treatment cycle (Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5) in establishment and maintenance of menstrual regulation, intensity of menstrual flow, and dysmenorrhea, as well as a comparison of the two presentations in terms of Global Satisfaction and Drug Satisfaction assessments performed by the patients and the investigating physician. At each study visit, drug compliance and use of concomitant medications, as well as incidence, severity and duration of adverse events were recorded. A total of 86 subjects were randomized to treatment, with 43 subjects in each treatment group. At Visit 2 and each subsequent visit, all patients in both treatment groups reported an episode of withdrawal bleeding during the 7 -day hormone-free period. We observed a statistically significant (p< 0. 0001) decrease in the incidence of dysmenorrhea at each study visit in relation to the pretreatment assessment. There was a significant reduction (p< 0. 0001) in the number of subjects reporting <b>intermenstrual</b> <b>bleeding</b> at each study visit in both treatment groups. Global Satisfaction scores by the patient and physician increased significantly at each successive study visit in both treatment groups. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, weight, and body mass index throughout the study period in either group. The number of subjects reporting adverse events at each visit did not vary between treatment groups. The combined oral contraceptive pill containing ethinylestradiol and cyproterone acetate was found to be both effective and safe in the menstrual irregularities of hyper-androgenic origin (amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and <b>intermenstrual</b> <b>bleeding)</b> assessed in this study. © Copyright Moreira Jr. Editora.

40|$|AbstractUterine fibroids (also called leiomyomas or myomas) are {{the most}} common {{disorder}} among women of reproductive age, with an incidence of between 20 % and 80 %; they are often detected incidentally in routine healthy examinations, through bimanual pelvic and/or ultrasound examination, because uterine fibroids are rarely associated with symptoms. Sometimes, uterine fibroids may be complicated by a variety of symptoms, including menstrual disturbance (e. g., menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, <b>intermenstrual</b> <b>bleeding),</b> pressure symptoms, bloated sensation, increased urinary frequency, bowel disturbance, or pelvic pain; therefore definite treatment is requested. Hysterectomy may be the first choice for women who have completed their child-birth; however, many women may prefer to keep the uterus if the uterine fibroids-related symptoms can be appropriately controlled. Among these conservative therapies, myomectomy {{may be one of the}} most popular methods for the woman who would like to preserve her future fertility, as the majority of symptoms can be relieved by myomectomy; this contributes to the value of this review.
