40|$|The patient’s {{progress}} report {{should be the}} most important medium of communication in nursing practise. As a result of various factors, however, this report is today often incomplete and not serving its purpose of providing total insight into the progress and treatment of the individual patient. Possible solutions to the problems encountered are patient-centred nursing care plans and problem oriented {{progress report}}s. These are however not always practical, given the realities and needs in most nursing units in South African hospitals. The author suggests an alternative system, using elements from both the above, which can be used to eliminate the problems and to change the <b>kardex</b> <b>system</b> into the effective group communication tool which it should be. The system includes the use of a Special Nursing Care Prescriptions Card which is placed with the usual progress report, clearer reporting on the patient’s condition by eliminating unqualified phrases such as “ condition satisfactory” and a special admission form which is also placed in the kardex...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 A {{model was}} {{developed}} for the inventory control of the Volkswagen spare parts distribution in Greece. The model utilizes the capabilities of a digital computer, and features four systems, the necessary system files and various routines. Flexible statistical forecasting techniques are included for forecasting the distributor parts demand. Computerized procedures are illustrated with flowcharts and each procedure is identified as a system. The factory order system prepares the factory order; the additions system updates the parts master file with the parts arrivals from the factory; the transactions system handles the transactions with the dealers; and the dealers centralized inventory control system provides dealer sales forecasting, dealer inventory reports, and {{an evaluation of the}} dealers performance. The model furnishes the distributor with important inventory management reports, whose contents are described. This model, to be implemented in Greece to replace the present manual <b>Kardex</b> <b>system,</b> entails the minimum of computer installation and operations costs, it is not restrained to a particular computer and is tailored to meet the current Volkswagen factory regulations...|$|E
40|$|The Mineral Industry Research Laboratory has {{developed}} a storage and retrieval file for Alaska mineral information to facilitate resource studies. The basis for the computer-processable file is the Division of ecological Survey Mineral <b>Kardex</b> <b>system</b> which contains an entry for every mineral property in Alaska that has either been recorded in the literature or has been claimed under the mineral staking laws. Use of the file has greatly increased the research capability of the laboratory to compile resource-oriented reports such as M. I. R. L. Report No. 16, IIFinal Report - Mineral Resources of Northern Alaska," M. I. R. L. Report No. 18, JlKnown and Potential Ore Reserves, Seward Peninsula, Alaska", and M. J. R. L Report No. 27, "Copper Mineral Occurrences in the Wrangell Mountain - Prince William Sound Area, Alaska" and S. E. Alaska Mineral Commodity Maps. The programs {{have been given the}} name MINFILE. MINFILEJ refers to a program that stores mineral information on magnetic tape. MINFILE 2 is a Retreival program, MINFILE 3 is a program to correct and make additions to the file. MINFILE 4 and MINFILE 5 are utility programs used for maintenance of the system...|$|E

50|$|The Remington Rand Systems {{division}} of Sperry Rand, now based in Marietta, Ohio, {{was acquired by}} Aarque Management Corporation of Jamestown, New York, and renamed to <b>Kardex</b> <b>Systems</b> {{to take advantage of}} Kardex's status as a long-famous brand in filing systems.|$|R

40|$|Continued {{interest}} by exploration companies in a Southeastern Alaska resource study in progress by the Mineral Industry Research Laboratory has prompted {{the release of}} some of the maps prior to the completion of the study. A report on the study should be available for distribution during the summer of 1970, and will contain a complete tabulation of all mineral properties and [...] prospects contained in the literature or staked under the mining laws. In addition, [...] the report will contain a description of U. S. Bureau of Mines mining districts, [...] a summary of the geology, and thoughts pertaining to possible controls for ore [...] deposits in the area. The commodity maps contained in this packet represent only those [...] properties currently listed in the State Division of Mines and Geology <b>Kardex</b> [...] <b>System.</b> Information pertaining to all properties tabulated in this system for [...] Southeastern Alaska has been digitized and stored on magnetic tape.
