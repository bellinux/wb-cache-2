50|$|About 500 {{plant and}} animal species inhabit the Delta, {{which is one of the}} largest {{estuaries}} in western North America. Before agricultural development of the Delta region, the Delta's many islands were forested by Tule, bulrush, and various reeds that flourished in intermittently flooded, low-lying marshy areas. Over thousands of years, the growth and decay of the various swampland plants formed a layer of peat 50 ft deep in places, hence the extremely high fertility of Delta soils. Sediment deposits formed natural levees around the borders of islands, where larger trees, mainly willows, were able to take root and form large riparian forests. The riparian forests were most pronounced along the Sacramento River and the lower Mokelumne River below its confluence with the Cosumnes River. More extensive woodlands were prominent on the fringes of the Delta bordering the riparian zones. Composed primarily of valley oak, box elder and Oregon ash, these oak woodlands grew in bands that stretched up to 3 mi inland. Farther away from water sources, vegetation gave way to grassland. The water Hyacinth has become one of the most destructive plants to the Delta water way. Within one year it will spread and cover as much as 6500 sq ft of water space in one growing season. It <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to the agricultural community to eliminate. The plants spread by budding and spreading its seeds, and those seeds fall to the bottom of the water, where they can stay viable in the muck for years. The Hyacinth can form a mat up to six feet thick, shutting off light and becoming acidic when they decompose.The Delta was formerly populated by large herds of deer and tule elk; their trails were so vast that early Spanish explorers supposed the area was inhabited by cattle. Significant numbers of California grizzly bears could also be found in the Delta. The extensive wetlands of the Delta supported massive bird populations, even today, half the migrating waterfowl in California still pass through the Delta. A survey in 2012 recorded a spring duck population of 48.6 million, the highest since counts began in 1955. Large mammals in the Delta have not fared so well; with most of their habitat converted to agriculture, remaining populations were highly susceptible to human impacts and natural disasters. Grizzlies were hunted to extinction, while the flood of 1878 wiped out the last of the elk herds in the Delta.|$|E
