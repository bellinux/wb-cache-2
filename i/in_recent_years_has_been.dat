5|$|On this site, 171 {{plant species}} are surveyed. Given {{its size and}} poor soil, this {{diversity}} is notable. Management undertaken <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> essential to maintaining open areas, the most threatened by primary succession. Thus, the various vegetation layers (pioneer and mature woodland, bushy areas, open areas) provide a mosaic of habitats, and thus remarkable species.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Auxois are still bred for meat production, and in 2001, 50% {{of the horses}} bred were intended for slaughter. However, the power and gaits of the breed make them valued for competitive and leisure driving, as well as equestrian tourism. The smaller horses of the breed are used for milk production. The Auxois is used for celebrations, such as weddings, and historical reenactments. It is also used for logging, and <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> increasingly used in agriculture, being found in vineyards, gardens and farms. The use of them {{for the maintenance of}} rural roads is also in planning.|$|E
5|$|Private flying is most {{associated}} with the traditional form of factory-produced two and four-seater, single piston-engine training and touring aircraft. Examples of these are the Cessna 152, Cessna 172, and Piper PA28 Cherokee, all with their origins in the 1950s, and the more modern designs of Cirrus. The average cost per hour to fly such aircraft has been estimated to be £133, compared to an estimated £77 per hour for gliders, and a reported £35 per hour for microlights. Recent trends have seen {{an increase in the}} use of microlights, and also in recreational helicopter flying following the introduction of smaller and cheaper machines such as the Robinson R22 and R44. Another growth area in private flying <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in the use of amateur built aircraft, such as the Van's Aircraft RV-4 and the Europa.|$|E
