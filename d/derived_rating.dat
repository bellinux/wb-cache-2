The basic questions were: 1. What are the psychometric characteristics of the Dutch version of the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 2 - 3 (CBCL/ 2 - 3) ? 2. What is the prevalence of problem behavior in Dutch toddlers aged 2 - 3 years in the connnunity, and in a broadly defined clinical sample as measured by the CBCL/ 2 - 3 ? 3. How are CBCL/ 2 - 3 scores in both samples related to demographic, family, and child characteristics, and in the clinical sample also to clinically relevant variables, such as referral complaints and psychiatric diagnosis? 4. How predictive are CBCL/ 2 - 3 scores of behavioral/emotional problems at home and at school over a 2 -year interval, as measured by parents' and teachers' standardized ratings of problem behavior. and reports of significant problems at home and school?...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the crucial role}} of chemometrics in facilitating the knowledge transfer of a laboratory <b>derived</b> <b>rating</b> for sugarcane clonal performance (based on GC measurements) towards a rapid near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic methodology for at-field screening applications. NIR sugarcane stalk spectra were collected from 65 sugarcane clones, which were obtained from two widely different geographical regions. An exploratory principal component analysis (PCA) of an NIR spectral data matrix of the sugarcane clones showed a clear trend along PCI similar to that found from the GC measurements, with the resistant clone (Q 90) being well discriminated from the susceptible one (NCo 310). Biplots related the NIR spectral frequencies with the spectral objects. Cellulose and lignin bands (4248 and 4406 cm(- 1) respectively) {{were associated with the}} well performing clones and epicuticular wax bands (4346 and 5781 cm(- 1)) with the poorly performing ones. Several partial least squares (PLS) regression models were constructed from the spectral objects, and satisfactorily predicted the traditional sugarcane performance ratings (SEP range +/- 0. 7 - 0. 9 traditional units for the verification data, and the Measured versus Predicted R- 2 range 0. 880 - 0. 910). In addition, the stalk spectra were investigated with the use of multicriteria decision-making methods, PROMETHEE and GAIA. This demonstrated that the spectral objects could be ranked {{on the basis of the}} NIR information alone, and that this rank order was in agreement with traditionally determined ratings. Thus, the performance of sugarcane clones could be assessed from molecular information as from the earlier laboratory GC measurements, and therefore, can be obtained completely independently of any conventional nominal ratings scales.

Our results are not in agreement with undamped, uniÐed calculations for C V but are in reasonable agreement with damped, uniÐed calculations for O VIII. For C V, the Burgess general formula (GF) yields a rate that is in very poor agreement with our <b>derived</b> <b>rate.</b> The Burgess & Tworkowski modiÐcation of the GF yields a rate that is also in poor agreement.
